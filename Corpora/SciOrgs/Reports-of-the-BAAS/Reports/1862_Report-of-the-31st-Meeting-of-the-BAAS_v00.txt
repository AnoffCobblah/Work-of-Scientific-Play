    REPORT OP THE COUNCIL.  XXXI

Repo7't of the Council of the British Association, presented to the
            General Committee at Manchester, September 4, 1861.

   (1) The Council were directed by the General Committee at Oxford to

maintain the Establishment of the Kew Observatory by aid of a grant of

£500. At each of the meetings of the Council, the Committee of the Observa-

tory have presented a detailed statement of their proceedings, and they have
transmitted the General Report for the year 1860-1861, which is annexed.

  A(2) sum not exceeding £90 was granted for one year, and placed at the

disposal of the Council for the payment of an additional Photographer for

carrying on the Photoheliographical Observations at Kew. On this subject
the Report of the Kew Committee, which is annexed, may be consulted.

  A(3) further sum of £30 was placed at the disposal of Mr. Broun, Dr.

Lloyd, and Mr. Stoney, for the construction of an Induction Dip-Circle, in
connexion with the Observatory at Kew. The result of this recommenda-

tion is stated in the Report of the Kew Committee.

   (4) The Report of the Parliamentary Committee has been received by the
Council for presentation to the General Committee to-day, and is printed for
the information of the Members.

    (5) Professor Phillips was requested to complete and print, before the
Manchester Meeting, a Classified Index to the Transactions of the Associa-
tion from 1831 to 1860 inclusive, and was authorized to employ, during this
period, an Assistant ; and the sum of £100 was placed at his disposal for the

purpose.

    Professor Phillips reports that he has secured the assistance of Mr. G.
Griffith, of Jesus College, Oxford, in carrying on the Index, which had been
already much advanced by the help of Mr. Askham, and states that with the
aid thus afforded he had hoped to be able to complete the work within the
time specified. Though this expectation has not been realized, specimens of
the work are laid before the Meeting.

    (6) Professor Phillips requested the attention of the Council to circum-

stances regarding his own health and occupations, which are gradually rcrider-
ing it necessary for him to prepare to withdraw from the duties of the As-
sistant General Secretary, which have been for many years intrusted to him;
and suggested that opportunity might be taken of this announcement to con-

sider whether the arrangements connected with the Secretariate should remain
unchanged, or be modified.

   The Council regret to have received letters from Professor Walker, General
Secretary, dated 15th March and 20th April, stating that, on account of in-
disposition which required cessation from labour, it would not be in his power

to continue his attention to the official business of the Association at the next
Meeting.

   Under these circumstances the Council requested Professor Phillips to draw
up in writing such statements and suggestions as might appear to him likely

to assist the Council in considering the steps to be taken in consequence of
these announcements*.

    (7) The communication of Professor Phillips in reference to the appoint-
ment of a General Secretary having been considered, the following Resolu-

tion was adopted :

   That the President, and the gentlemen who have formerly acted as General

      Secretaries, viz. the Rev. W. V. Harcourt, Sir R. I. Murchison, and

    * The statement drawn up by Professor Phillips in consequence of this request was
printed in the Minutes of tlae Council, and separate copies were laid before the General
Committee.

XXxii           --REPORT 1861.

Major-General Sabine, together with Professor Phillips, be a Committee

Council to take in regard  to the  appointment   of  a  General Secretary

   By the following Report, which has been received from these gentlemen,

the General Committee will learn with satisfaction that, if it be their

pleasure to elect him, the services of a most efficient and experienced Mem-

ber, who has discharged many offices, including the Presidency, with great

benefit to the Association, are at their disposal for the duty of General

Secretary.

   Report of the Rev, W. V. Harcourt, Sir R. I. Murchison, and Major-

                                                 General Sabine.

    Considering the present state of health of the General Secretary of the
British Association, the Rev. Professor Walker, F.R.S., and the announced
withdrawal at no distant period of Professor John Phillips, F.R.S., from the
post of Assistant General Secretary, which he has so long held, and with such

very great advantage to the British Association, we the undersigned, as
requested by the Council to propose some suitable arrangement, have now to
express our unanimous opinion that Mv. William Hopkins, F.R.S., of St.

Peter's College, Cambridge, is eminently qualified to fill the post of Joint

General Secretary.

  We beg to add that, having applied to Mr. Hopkins, we find that he cor-

dially accepts the offer, and, with the sanction of the Council, will be ready

to commence his duties at the ensuing Manchester Meeting.
   The consideration of the future relation of Professor Phillips to the British

Association is postponed, in compliance with his own request.

   The Council have resolved, in conformity with the recommendation of this
Report, to propose to-day in the General Committee that W. Hopkins, Esq.,

M.A., F.R.S., be elected General Secretary.

   (8) The following Foreign gentlemen, eminent in Science, who were

present at the late Oxford Meeting and took part in the proceedings, were

elected Corresponding Members of the British Association :

Dr. Bergsma, Utrecht.              M. Khanikoff, St. Petersburg.
Dr. Carus, Leipzig.                M. Werner Siemens, Vienna.
Prof. A. Favre, Geneva.
Dr. Geinitz, Dresden.              Prof. B. Pierce, Cambridge, U.S.
Dr. Hochstetter, Vienna.           Prof. E. Verdet, Paris.

   (9) Major-General Sabine communicated a copy of the Statutes of the
Humboldt Foundation, now definitely organized, and of a Circular issued by

the Committee, announcing that about £8000 had been secured as a Capital
Fund, and that about £260 will be available in tlie year 1862 for the general
object of assisting Researches in Natural Science and Travels, in which Hum-
boldt was conspicuously active. The disposition of the fund rests with the
Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin, and is open to applications from Sci-

entific Travellers of all nations.

   (10) The Council are informed that Invitations will be presented to the
General Committee at its Meeting on Monday, September 9, to hold the next
meeting in Cambridge. The invitations formerly offered on the part of
Birmingham and Newcastle-on-Tyne will be renewed on this occasion ; and
other invitations will be presented from Bath and Nottingham.

Report of the Keio Committee of the British Association for the
                 Advancement of Science for 1860-1861.

The Committee of the Kew Observatory beg to submit to the Association

the following Report of their proceedings during the past year.

It was noticed in a previous Report that General Sabine had undertaken

to tabulate the hourly values of the magnetic elements from tlie curves given

by these instruments. These values have been reduced under his super-

intendence, and some of the results have been embodied in the following

papers which he has communicated to the Royal Society :

-- (1) On the Solar-diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Declination at Pekin.
   Proceedings of the Royal Societ)', vol. x. p. 360.

   (2) On the Laws of the Phenomena of the larger Disturbances of the
Magnetic Declination in the Kew Observatory : with notices of the progress

--of our knowledge regarding the Magnetic Storms. Proceedings of the

Royal Society, vol. x. p. 624.

   (3) On the Lunar-diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Declination obtained

--from the Kew Photograms in the years 1858, 1839, and 1860. Proceedings

of the Royal Society, vol. xi. p. 73.

The Superintendent, Mr. Stewart, has also communicated to the Royal

Society a description of the great magnetic storm at the end of August and

beginning of September 1859, deduced from the Kew Photographs.

Mr. Chambers continues to be zealously employed in the magnetical de-

partment, and attends to the self-recording magnetographs, which have been

maintained in constant operation.

The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-

tinue  to  be  made and                        the  dip  observations from  November 1857  to  the
                                            ;

present date (282 in all), a large portion of which were made by the late

Mr. Welsh and Mr. Chambers, have been made available by General Sabine

in connexion with some previous observations of his own for determining

the secular change in the magnetic dip in London, between the years 1821

and 1860. See Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xi. p. 144.

   The instruments for the Dutch Government alluded to in the last Report

have been verified at Kew and taken away. They consisted of a set of self-

recording magnetographs with a tabulating instrument, two Dip Circles, and

one Fox's Dip Circle for Dr. Bergsma ; also of two Unifilars, one for Dr.
Bergsma and one for Dr. Buys Ballot.

    Shortly after the despatch of these instruments, another set of self-record-

ing Magnetographs were received at Kew, in order to be tested previous to
their being sent to Dr. Bache, of the United States, and these were despatched

in the early part of this year to America, along with a tabulating instrument,

a Unifilar, and Dip Circle, all of which were verified at Kew.

  The staff at Kew are at present occupied with a third set of these instru-

ments, along with a Dip Circle and Unifilar, for the University of Coimbra
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and Prof. Da Souza of that University is engaged at present at the Kew

Observatory in examining his instruments, and in receiving instructions

regarding them.

It will thus be seen that no fewer than three sets of these instruments

XXxiv  REPORT 1861.

have been furnished during this last year, under the superintendence of the
Committee, and it has hitherto been deemed advisable for the interests of

science that no charge should be made for their verification. As this, how-

ever, is an operation involving labour and a large expenditure of time, an

application was made to the Royal Society for the sum of £90 from the

Donation Fund, in order to cover the expense of verifying these three sets

of instruments, while it was arranged that in future a charge of £30 for
verification should be added to the cost of each set. This sum was at once
granted by the Council of the Royal Society, and it will be found among

the receipts in the financial statement appended to this Report.
    In addition to the instruments already mentioned, the following have also

been verified at Kew Observatory :

    For the Havana Observatory, a set of differential magnetic instruments,
also a Unifilar, Dip Circle, and an altitude and azimuth instrument for abso-

lute determinations of the magnetic elements.
    For Dr. Smallwood, Montreal, a Unifilar, Dip Circle, and Differential

Declinometer.

    For the Astronomer Royal, Greenwich, a 9-inch Unifilar.

   For the Rev. W. Scott, Sydney, a Unifilar and Dip Circle.

    For Dr. Livingstone, Africa, a Unifilar, Dip Circle, and Azimuth Compass.
    For Mr. Jackson, Bach, of Science, Ceylon, a Unifilar and Dip Circle.
   Mr. Jackson and M. Capello, of the Lisbon Observatory, have also received

instruction at Kew in the use of instruments.

    The meteorological work of the Observatory continues to be performed in
a satisfactory manner by Mr. George Whipple ; and here the Committee de-
sire to mention that, both from the report of the Superintendent and from
their own observation, each member of the staff at present attached to the

establishment seems to interest himself in the duties he is called upon to

discharge.

    During the past year, 150 Barometers, 660 Thermometers, and 8 Hydro-

meters have been verified at the Observatory.

    Seven Standard Thermometers have also been constructed and disposed

of. Dr. Bergsma and Dr. Buys Ballot were each presented with one of

these instruments.

    For some time telegraphic reports of the meteorological elements were

daily sent to Admiral FitzRoy's office, the expense being defrayed by the
Board of Trade ; but these despatches were ultimately discontinued, on

account of the Board of Trade having only a limited sum disposable for

meteorological telegraphy, and Kew being too near London to prove a use-

ful station.

   At the last Meeting at Oxford it was announced that the Kew Heliograph

was about to be transported to Spain for the purpose of photographing, if

possible, the so-called red flames visible on the occasion of a total solar
eclipse. That the mission had most successfully accomplished the object

contemplated was known in England on the morning of the 19th of July,
1860 (the day after the eclipse), by the publication in the · Times' news-

paper of a telegram sent by Mr. Warren De la Rue from Rivabellosa, near
Miranda, where the Kew party were stationed.

    It will be remembered that, at the suggestion of the Astronomer Royal,
the Admiralty had placed at the disposal of the expedition of astronomers
H.M. Ship ' Himalaya,' and that the Government Grant Committee of the
Royal Society had voted the sum of £150 for the purpose of defraying the

expenses of transporting the Kew Heliograph with a staff of assistants to

Spain.
REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.  XXXV

    As the scheme became matured, it was deemed desirable to extend con-

siderably the preparations originally contemplated ; and actual experience
subsequently proved that no provision which had been made could have
been safely omitted. Originally it was thought that a mere temporary tent
for developing the photographs might have answered the purpose ; but on
maturing the scheme of operations, it became evident that a complete photo-

graphic observatory, with its dark developing-room, cistern of water, sink,
and shelves to hold the photographs, would be absolutely necessary to ensure

success. An observatory was therefore constructed in such a manner that

it could be taken to pieces and made into packages of small weight for easy
transport, and at the same time be readily put together again on the locality
selected. The house when completed weighed 1248 lbs., and was made up
in eight cases. Altogether the packages, including house and apparatus,
amounted in number to thirty, and in weight to 34 cwt.

    Besides the Heliograph, the apparatus comprised a small transit theodolite

for determining the position of the meridian, and ascertaining local time and
the latitude and longitude of the station, and also a very fine three-inch

achromatic telescope, by Dallmeyer, for the optical observation of the phe-
nomena of the eclipse. Complete sets of chemicals were packed in du-
plicate in separate boxes, to guard against failure through a possible accident

to one set of the chemicals. Collodion of different qualities was made
sensitive in London, and some was taken not rendered sensitive, so as to

secure as far as possible good results. Distilled water, weighing 139 lbs.,
had to be included ; and engineers' and carpenters' tools, weighing 113 lbs.,

were taken.
   Mr. Casella lent some thermometers and a barometer, and Messrs.

Elliott an aneroid barometer to the expedition.

   The preparations were commenced by Mr. Beckley (of the Kew Observa-
tory) early in the year 1860; and in June Mr. De la Rue engaged Mr.

Reynolds to assist Mr. Beckley in completing them.
   Mr. Beckley and Mr. Reynolds were charged with the erection of the

Observatory at Rivabellosa ; and so well were the plans organized that the
Observatory and Heliograph were in actual operation on the 12th of July,
the expedition having sailed from Plymouth in the ' Himalaya ' on the
morning of the 7th. This could not, however, have been so expeditiously

accomplished without the energetic cooperation of Mr. Vignoles, who met
the ' Himalaya ' in a small steamer he had chartered to convey the expedi-
tion and their apparatus into the port of Bilbao, and who despatched the

Kew apparatus, as soon as it was landed, to the locality he and Mr. De la Rue

had agreed upon. This was situated seventy miles distant from the port of
landing, and accessible only through a difficult pass. Mr. Vignoles had also

taken the trouble to make arrangements for accommodating the Kew party,

--and for the due supply of provisions a matter of some importance in such

a locality.

   Besides Mr. De la Rue, Mr. Beckley, and Mr. Reynolds, the party con-
sisted of Mr. Downes and Mr. E. Beck, two gentlemen who gave their
gratuitous services, and of Mr. Clark, who acted as interpreter, also kindly

assisting during the eclipse. Each of the party had only one thing to attend
to ; and thus rapidity of operation and certainty of result were secured.

   The total expenditure of this expedition amounted to £512 ; the balance
of £362 over the amount granted by the Royal Society has been generously
defrayed by Mr. De la Rue.

    Upwards of forty photographs were taken during the eclipse and a little
before and after it, two being taken during the totality, on which are depicted

                                                                                c2

the luminous prominences with a piecision impossible of attainment by hand
drawings. The measurements which have been made of these prominences

by Mr. De la Rue show incontrovertibiy tliat they must belong to the sun,

and that they are not produced by the deflection of the sun's light through

the valleys ot the moon. The same prominences, except those covered over

during the moon's progress, correspond exactly when one negative is laid

over the other ; and by copying these by means of a camera, when so placed,

a representation is obtained of the whole of the prominences visible during

the eclipse in their true relative position. The photographs of the several

phases of the eclipse have served to trace out the path of the moon's centre

in reference to the sun's centre during the progress of the phenomenon.

Now, Rivabellosa being north of the central line of the moon's shadow, the

moon's centre did not pass exactly across the sun's centre, but was depressed

a little btlow it, so that a little more of the prominences situated on the

north (the upper) limb of the sun became visible than would have been the

case exactly under the central line, while, on the other hand, a little of those

on the southern limb was shut off. It has been proved, by measuring the

photographs, that the moon during the totality covered and uncovered the

prominences to the extent of about 94" of arc in the direction of her path,

and that a prominence situated at a right angle to the path shifted its angular

position with respect to the moon's centre by lagging behind .5° 55'. On

both the photographs is recorded a prominence, not visible optically, showing

that photography can render visible phenomena which without its aid would

escape observation. Copies of the two totality pictures are being made to

illustrate Mr. De la Rue's paper in the Report of the ' Himalaya ' Expedition

by the Astronomer Royal.
                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

    Positive enlarged copies of the phases of the eclipse, nine inches in dia-

meter, have also been made by means of the camera, and will be exhibited

at the Manchester Meeting.

The Heliograph has since been replaced in the Observatory ; but few

opportunities have occurred for using it, in consequence of the pressure of

other work                                                  latterlj', however,                                                                                                                   Mr. Beckley has been   requested  to carry on
                                                         ;

some experiments with the view of ascertaining whether any more details

are rendered visible when the full aperture of 3 inches of the telescope is

used, than when it is reduced to about one inch and a half. Up to the pre-

sent time no definite conclusion can be drawn from the results obtained ; so

that, at all events, an increase of aperture does not appear to give a strikingly

better result when a picture of the same size is taken with various aperture's

of the object-glass. IMore experiments, however, are needed before this

point, which is one of some importance in guiding us in the construction of

future instruments, can be. answered definitely. Mr. Beckley has obtained

sun-pictures of great beauty during the course of these experiments.

The work of the Kew Observatory is now so increased that it has become

absolutely imperative to make some provision for working the Heliograph
in a way that will not interfere with the current work of that establishment

and Mr. De la Rue has been requested by his colleagues of the Kew Com-

mittee to take charge of the instrument at his observatorj', where celestial

photography is continuously, carried on. This request Mr. De la Rue has

kindly acceded                                              to           and  he will                                                                                                             for a time  undertake  to  record the sun-spots
                                                                      ;

at Craiiford. as long as it is found not to interfere with his other observations.

INIr. De la Rue has contrived, and had made by ^Messrs. Simms at his own

expense, an instrument for measuring the photographs, which will much facili-

tate the reduction of the results. It consists of a fixed frame in which work
two slides, moving at right angles to each other. Each is furnished with a
                 BEPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                     XXXVU

vernier reading to To'oo^th of an inch. The top slide works on the lower
slide, and carries a hollow axis 44 inches diameter, on which rotates hori-

zontally a divided circle reading to 10", and this carries a second circle on

the face of which are fixed four centering screws. An image intended to

be measured is placed on the upper circle, and is centred by means of the

adjusting screws ; it is then adjusted by means of the upper circle in any
required angular position with respect to the lower divided circle, so as to

bring the cross lines of the photograph in position under a fixed microscope,

supported on an arm from the fixed frame. By means of this instrument

the sun-pictures are measured so as to determine the diameter to xoVoth of
the radius ; the angular position of any part of a sun-spot and its distance
from the centre are thus readily ascertained ; or the differences of the right

ascension and declination with respect to the centre are as easily read off to

the same degree of accuracy.

   Mr. De la Rue has recently produced by his large Telescope an image of

a solar spot, and portion of the sun's disc, far superior to anything before

effected, and which leads to the hope that a new era is opened in heliography,

and that the resources of this Observatory might be further developed in

that direction.

   At the last Meeting of the Association the sum of £90 was voted for an
additional photographer, and of this sum £50 has been received. The Com-

mittee suggest that the balance of £40 be granted again at this Meeting, as

Athe full sura will be required during the ensuing year.  detailed account

of this expenditure will be presented in the next Annual Report-

Allusion was made in last Report to an instrument constructed by Prof.

William Thomson, of Glasgow, for determining photographically the electric

state of the atmosphere. This instrument has been fitted up at Kew, where

it has been in constant operation since the beginning of February last. It

has been found to answer well in a photographic point of view, and Prof.

Thomson has expressed himself much pleased with the results obtained.
The mechanical arrangements connected with the fitting up of this instru-

ment were devised and executed with much skill by Mr. Beckley, the
Mechanical Assistant, who has also recently made a working drawing of the

instrument for Prof. Thomson, who intends to publish a description of it.
   The arrangements made by Mr. Francis Galton, in the Observatory Park,

for testing sextants, and which were alluded to in last Report, are now almost

complete ; and six sextants sent by Captain Washington, R.N., Her Majesty's

Hydrographer, have been verified.

The Observatory was honoured with a visit from His Imperial Highness

Prince Napoleon on the 9th of September last. His Highness expressed

much satisfaction at witnessing the eflScient state of the Institution.

Application has been made to the Commissioners for the International

Exhibition of 1862, for a space of 40 feet by 20, in which to exhibit as
many as possible of the instruments in use at the Observatory, including

those which are self-recording.

The Committee desire to express their thanks for a valuable addition

which has been made to the Library at Kew, consisting of a very large number

of the Greenwich publications, presented to them through the kindness of the

Astronomer Royal.

It will be observed by the annexed statement that the expenditure of last

year has exceeded the income by about ^690 ; but as this year comprised

five quarters, it is hoped that the usual annual grant of £500 will cover the

expense until the next Meeting of the Association.

  Report of the Parliamentary Committee to the Meeting of the British
                    Association at Manchester, in September 1861.

     The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report :
     That on the 19th of July they met the Steam Performance Committee, by
 appointment, at the Admiralty, and had, in company with the Members of
 that Committee, an interview with the Duke of Somerset.
     That in the course of that interview the Chairman of your Committee

 shortly explained the motives which had induced the British Association to
 appoint the Steam Performance Committee, and called upon Mr, Fairbairn,

 who thereupon stated and explained the principal suggestions contained in
 the Report of the Steam Performance Committee, which had been prepared
 and agreed upon, and will be presented to this Meeting ; and urged upon
 His Grace the expediency of carrying them into effect.

    The Duke of Somerset, in reply, stated certain objections which he en-

 tertained to some of the suggestions, founded chiefly upon the circumstances
 that suflicient time could not be allowed for the various experiments con-

                          ADDRESS

                                                  BY

WILLIAM PAIRBAIRN, Esq., LL.D., C.E., E.R.S.

--Gentlemen, Ever since my election to the high office I now occupy, I

have been deeply sensible of my own unfitness for a post of so much distinc-

tion and responsibility. And when I call to mind the illustrious men who
have preceded me in this Chair, and see around me so many persons much

mybetter qualified for the office than my-ielf, I feel the novelty of  position

and unfeigned embarrassment in addressing you.

I should, however, very imperfectly discharge the duties which devolve

upon me, as the successor of the distinguished nobleman who presided over

the meetings of last year, if I neglected to thank you for the honourable

position in which you have placed me, and to express, at the outset, my
gratitude to those valued friends with whom I have been united for many

years in the labours of the Sections of this Association, and from whom I

have invariably received every mark of esteem.

  A careful perusal of the history of this Association will demonstrate that

it was the first and for a long time the only institution which brought toge-

ther for a common object the learned Professors of our Universities and the

workers in practical science. These periodical reunions have been of incalcu-

lable benefit, in giving to practice that soundness of principle and certainty

of progressive improvement, which can only be obtained by the accurate

study of science and its application to the arts. On the other hand, the men

of actual practice have reciprocated the benefits thus received from theory,

in testing by actual experiment deductions which were doubtful, and recti-

fying those which were erroneous. Guided by an extended experience, and

exercising a sound and disciplined judgment, they have often corrected

theories apparently accurate, but nevertheless founded on incomplete data or

on false assumptions inadvertently introduced. If the British Association

had effected nothing more than the removal of the anomalous separation of

theory and practice, it would have gained imperishable renown in the benefit

thus conferred.

Were I to enlarge on the relation of the achievements of science to the

comforts and enjoyments of man, 1 should have to refer to the present epoch as

one of the most important in the history of the world. At no former period

did science contribute so much to the uses of life and the wants of society. And

in doing this it has only been fulfilling that mission which Bacon, the great

father of modern science, appointed for it, when he wrote that " the legiti-
mate goal of the sciences is the endowment of human life with new inventions

and riches," and when he sought for a natural philosophy which, not spending

                                                                         d2
--lii REPORT 1861.

its energy on barren disquisitions, " should be operative for the benefit and

endowment of mankind."

   Looking, then, to the fact that, whilst in our time all the sciences have
yielded this fruit, Engineering science, with which I have been most inti-

mately connected, has preeminently advanced the power, the wealth, and the

comforts of mankind, 1 shall probably best discharge the duties of the office

I have the honour to fill, by stating as briefly as possible the more recent

scientific discoveries which have so influenced the relations of social life. 1

shall, therefore, not dwell so much on the progress of abstract science, im-

portant as that is, but shall rather endeavour briefly to examine the applica-
tion of science to the useful arts, and the results which have followed, and

are likely to follow, in the improvement of the condition of society.

The history of man throughout the gradations and changes which he

undergoes in advancing from a primitive barbarism to a state of civilization,

shows that he has been chiefly stimulated to the cultivation of science and

the development of his inventive powers by the urgent necessity of providing

for his wants and securing his safety. There is no nation, however barba-

rous, which does not inherit the germs of civilization, and there is scarcely

any which has not done something towards applying the rudiments of science

to the purposes of daily life.

Amongst the South Sea Islanders, when discovered by Cook, the applied

sciences (if I may use the term) were not entirely unknown. They had

observed something of the motions of the heavenly bodies, and watched with

interest their revolutions, in order to apply this knowledge to the division of

time. They were not entirely deficient in the construction of instruments of

husbandry, of war, and of music. They had made themselves acquainted

with the rudiments of shipbuilding and navigation, in the construction and

management of their canoes. Cut off from the influence of European civili-

zation, and deprived of intercourse with higher grades of mind, we still find

the inherent principle of progression exhibiting itself, and the inventive and

reasoning powers developed in the attempt to secure the means of subsistence.

Again, if we compare man as he exists in small communities with his con-

dition where large numbers are congregated together, we find that densely

populated countries are the most prolific in inventions, and advance most

rapidly in science. Because the wants of the many are greater than those of

the few, there is a more vigorous struggle against the natural limitations of

supply, a more careful husbanding of resources, and there are more minds

at work.

This fact is strikingly exemplified in the history of Mexico and Peru, and

its attestation is found in the numerous monuments of the past which are

seen in Central America, where the remains of cities and temples, and vast

public works, erected by a people endowed with high intellectual acquire-

ments, can still be traced. There have been discovered a system of canals

for irrigation ; long mining-galleries cut in the solid rock, in search of lead,

tin,  and  copper                            pyramids  not  unlike  those  of  Egypt ;  earthenware  vases
                                          ;

and cups, and manuscripts containing the records of their history ; all testi-

fying to so high a degree of scientific culture and practical skill that, looking

at the cruelties which attended the conquests of Cortes and Pizarro, we may

well hesitate as to which had the stronger claims on our sympathy, the victors

or the vanquished.

In attempting to notice those branches of science with which I am but

imperfectly acquainted, I shall have to claim your indulgence. This Asso-
ciation, as you are aware, does not confine its discussions and investigations
to any particular science; and one great advantage of this is, that it leads to

the division of labour, whilst the attention which each department receives,
and the harmony with which the plan has hitherto worked, afford the best
guarantee of its wisdom and proof of its success.

   In the early history of Astronomy, how vague and unsatisactory were the

wild theories and conjectures which supplied the place of demonstrated

physical truths and carefully observed laws ! How immeasurably small,

what a very speck does man appear, with all the wonders of his invention,
when contrasted with the mighty works of the Creator; and how imperfect

is our apprehension, even in the highest fligiits of poetic imagination, of the
boundless depths of space I These reflections naturally suggest themselves
in the contemplation of the works of an Almighty Power, and impress the

mind with a reverential awe for the great Author of our existence.
   The great revolution which laid the foundation of modern Astronomy,

and which, indeed, marks the birth of modern physical science, is chiefly
due to three or four distinguished philosophers. Tycho Brahe, by his
system of accurate measurement of the positions of the heavenly bodies,

Copernicus, by his theory of the solar system, Galileo, by the application of
the telescope, and Kepler, by the discovery of the laws of the planetary
motions, all assisted in advancing, by prodigious strides, towards a true
knowledge of the constitution of the universe. It remained for Newton to

introduce, at a later period, the idea of an attraction varying directly as the
mass, and inversely as the square of the distance, and thus to reduce celes-

tial phenomena to the greatest simplicity, by comprehending them under a
single law. Without tracing the details of the history of this science, we
may notice that in more recent times astronomical discoveries have been

closely connected with high mechanical skill in the construction of instru-

ments of precision. The telescope has enormously increased the catalogue
of the fixed stars, or those " landmarks of the universe," as Sir John Herschel

terms them, " which never deceive the astronomer, navigator, or surveyor."

The number of known planets and asteroids has also been greatly enlarged.
The discovery of Uranus resulted immediately from the perfection attained
by Sir William Herschel in the construction of his telescope. More recently,

the structure of the nebulae has been unfolded through the application to

their study of the colossal telescope of Lord Rosse. In all these directions
much has been done both by our present distinguished Astronomer Royal
and also by amateur observers in private observatories, all of whom, with
Mr. Lassell at their head, are making rapid advances in this department of

physical science.

   Our knowledge of the physical constitution of the central body of our
system seems likely, at the present time, to be much increased. The spots

on the sun's disk were noticed by Galileo and his contemporaries, and enabled
them to ascertain the time of its rotation and the inclination of its axis.
They also correctly inferred, from their appearance, the existence of a lumi-
nous envelope, in which funnel-shaped depressions revealed a solid and dark
nucleus. Just a century ago, Alexander Wilson indicated the presence of a
second and less luminous envelope beneath the outer stratum, and his dis-

covery was confirmed by Sir William Herschel, who was led to assume the

presence of a double stratum of clouds, the upper intensely luminous, the
lower grey, and forming the penumbra of the spots. Observations during
eclipses have rendered probable the supposition of a third and outermost stra-
tum of imperfect transparency enclosing concentrically the other envelopes.
Still more recently,the remarkable discoveries of Kirchhoff andBunsen require
us to believe that a solid or liquid photosphere is seen through an atmosphere
containing iron, sodium, lithium, and other metals in a vaporous condition.
--liv REPORT 1861.

  We must still wait for the application of more perfect instruments, and

especially for the careful registering of the appearances of the sun bj' the

photoheliograph of Sir John Herschel, so ably employed by Mr. "Warren De

la Rue, Mr. Welsh, and others, before we can expect a solution of all tLe

problems thus suggested.
   Guided by the same principles which have been so successful in Astronomy,

its sister science, Magnetism, emerging from its infancy, has of late advanced
rapidly in that stage of development which is marked by assiduous and
systematic observation of the phenomena, by careful analysis and presenta-
tion of the facts which they disclose, and by the grouping of these in gene-
ralizations, which, when the basis on which they rest shall be more extended,
will prepare the way for the conception of a general physical theory, in which

all the phenomena shall be comprehended, whilst each shall receive its

separate and satisfactory explanation.

It is unnecessary to remind you of the deep interest which the British

Association has at all times taken in the advancement of this branch of

natural knowledge, or of the specific recommendations which, made in con-

junction with the Royal Society, have been productive of such various and

--important results. To refer but to a single instance, we have seen those

magnetic disturbances, so mysterious in their origin and so extensive in simul-

taneous prevalence, and which, less than twenty years ago, were designated

--by a term specially denoting that their laws were wholly unknown, traced

to laws of periodical recurrence, revealing, without a doubt, their origin in

the central body of our system, by inequalities which have for their respect-

ive periods, the solar day, the solar year, and still more remarkably, an

until lately unsuspected solar cycle of about ten of our terrestrial years, to

whose existence they bear testimony in conjunction with the solar spots,

but whose nature and causes are in all other respects still wrapped in entire

Weobscurity.  owe to General Sabine, especially, the recognition and study

of these and other solar magnetic influences and of the magnetic influence

of the moon similarly attested by concurrent determinations in many parts of

the globe, which are now held to constitute a distinct branch of this science

not inappropriately named " celestial," as distinguished from purely terres-

trial magnetism.

  We ought not in this town to forget that the very rapid advance which

has been made in our time by Chemistry is due to the law of equivalents,

or atomic theory, first discovered by our townsman, Jolin Dalton. Since

the development of this law its progress has been unimpeded, and it has had

Aa most direct bearing on the comforts and enjoyments of life.  knowledge

of the constituents of food has led to important deductions as to the relative

nutritive value and commercial importance of different materials. Water

has been studied in reference to the deleterious impurities with which it is so

apt to be contaminated in its distribution to the inhabitants of large towns.

The power of analysis, which enables us to detect adulterations, has been

invaluable to the public health, and would be much more so, if it were

possible to obviate the difficulties which have prevented the operation of

recent legislation on this subject.

  We have another proof of the utility of this science in its application to

medicine; and the estimation in which it is held by the medical profession

is the true index of its value in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The

largest developments of chemistry, however, have been in connexion with

the useful arts. What would now be the condition of calico-printing,

bleaching, dyeing, and even agriculture itself, if they had been deprived of

the aid of theoretic chemistry ?
                     ADDRESS.          it

 --For example, Aniline first discovered in coal-tar by Dr. Hofmann, who
--has so admirably developed its properties is now most extensively used as

the basis of red, blue, violet, and green dyes. This important discovery will

probably in a few years render this country independent of the world for

dye-stuffs ; and it is more than probable that England, instead of drawing

her dye-stuffs from foreign countries, may herself become the centre from

which all the world will be supplied.

   It is an interesting fact that at the same time in another branch of this
science, M. Tournet has lately demonstrated that the colours of gems, such

as the emerald, aqua-marina, amethyst, smoked rock-crystal, and others, are

due to volatile hydrocarbons, first noticed by Sir David Brewster in clouded

topaz, and that they are not derived from metallic oxides, as has been hitherto

believed.

Another remarkable advance has recently been made by Bunsen and

Kirchhoff in the application of the coloured rays of the prism to analytical

Weresearch.     may consider their discoveries as the commencement of a new

era in analytical chemistry, from the extraordinary facilities they afford in

the qualitative detection of the minutest traces of elementary bodies. The
value of the method has been proved by the discovery of the new metals

Caesium and Rubidium by M. Bunsen, and it has yielded another remark-
able result in demonstrating the existence of iron, and six other known

metals, in the sun.

In noticing the more recent discoveries in this important science, I must

not pass over in silence the valuable light which chemistry has thrown upon

the composition of iron and steel. Although Despretz demonstrated many

years ago that iron would combine with nitrogen, yet it was not until 1857

that Mr. C. Binks proved that nitrogen is an essential element of steel, and

more recently M. Carou and M. Fremy have further elucidated this subject

the former showing that cyanogen, or cyanide of ammonium, is the essential

element which converts wrought iron into steel; the latter combining iron

with nitrogen through the medium of ammonia, and then converting it into
steel by bringing it at the proper temperature into contact with common

coal-gas. There is little doubt that in a few years these discoveries will

enable Sheffield manufacturers to replace their present uncertain, cumbrous,

and expensive process, by a method at once simple and inexpensive, and so

completely under control as to admit of any required degree of conversion

being obtained with absolute certainty. Mr. Grace Calvert also has proved that
cast iron contains nitrogen, and has shown that it is a definite compound of

carbon and iron mixed with various proportions of metallic iron, according

to its nature.

   Before leaving chemical science, I must refer to the interesting discovery

by M. Deville, by which he succeeded in rapidly melting thirty-eight or

--forty pounds of platinum a metal till then considered almost infusible.

This discovery will render the extraction of platinum from the ore more

perfect, and, by reducing its cost, will greatly facilitate its application to

the arts.

It is little more than half a century since Geology assumed the distinctive

character of a science. Taking into consideration the aspects of nature in

different epochs of the history of the earth, it has been found that the study
of the changes at present going on in the world around us enable us to under-

stand the past revolutions of the globe, and the conditions and circumstances
under which strata have been formed and organic remains imbedded and

preserved. The geologist has increasingly tended to believe that the changes
which have taken place on the face of the globe, from the earliest times to
--Ivi REPORT 1861.

the present, are the result of agencies still at work. But whilst it is his
high office to record the distribution of life in past ages and the evidence of
physical changes in the arrangement of land and water, his results hitherto
have indicated no traces of its beginning, nor have they afforded evidence of
the time of its future duration. Geology has been indebted for this progress
very largely to the investigations of Sedgwick and the writings of Sir

 Charles Lyell.

    As an example of the application of geology to the'^practical uses of life,
I may cite the discovery of the gold-fields of Australia, which might long

have remained hidden, but for the researches of Sir Roderick Murchison in
the Ural Mountains on the geological position of the strata from which the

Russian gold is obtained. From this investigation he was led by inductive

reasoning to believe that gold would be found in similar rocks, specimens of
which had been sent him from Australia. The last years of the active life
of this distinguished geologist have been devoted to the re-examination of
the rocks of his native Highlands of Scotland. Applying to them those
principles of classification which he long since established, he has demon-
 strated that the crystalline limestone and quartz-rocks which are associated
with mica schists, &c., belong by their imbedded organic remains to the
Lower Silurian rocks. Descending from this well-marked horizon, he
shows the existence beneath all such fossiliferous strata of vast masses of
sandstone and conglomerate ol' Cambrian age ; and, lastly, he has proved the
existence of a fundamental gneiss, on which all the other rocks repose, and
which, occupying the North-western Hebrides and the west coasts of Suther-
land and Ross, is the oldest rock-formation on the British Isles, it being
unknown in England, Wales, or Ireland.

    It is well known that the temperature increases, as we descend through
the earth's crust, from a certain point near the surface, at which the tem-

perature is constant. In various mines, borings, and artesian wells, the
temperature has been found to increase about 1^ Fahr. for every 60 or 65
feet of descent. In some carefully conducted experiments during the sinking

of Dukinfield Deep Mine (one of the deepest pits in this country), it was
found that a mean increase of about 1° in 71 feet occurred. If we take the
ratio thus indicated, and assume it to extend to much greater depths, we

should reach at two and a half miles from the surface-strata at the tempera-
ture of boiling water ; and at depths of about fifty or sixty miles the tem-
perature would be sufficient to melt, under the ordinary pressure of the
atmosphere, the hardest rocks. Reasoning from these facts, it would appear
that the mass of the globe, at no great depth, must be in a fluid state. But
this deduction requires to be modified by other considerations, namely, the
influence of pressure on the fusing-point, and the relative conductivity of

the rocks which form the earth's crust. To solve these questions a series of
important experiments were instituted by Mr. Hopkins, in the prosecution

 of which Dr. Joule and myself took part ; and after a long and laborious
investigation, it was found that the temperature of fluidity increased about
 1° Fahr. for every 500 lbs. pressure, in the case of spermaceti, bees-wax, and
other similar substances. However, on extending these experiments to less
compressible substances, such as tin and barytes, a similar increase was not
observed. But these series of experiments has been unavoidably interrupted

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

nor is the series on the conductivity of rocks entirely finished. Until they

have been completed by Mr. Hopkins, we can only make a partial use of
them in forming an opinion of the thickness of the earth's solid crust.
Judging, however, alone from the greater conductivity of the igneous rocks,
we may calculate that the thickness cannot possibly be less than nearly three
                                                                                                 ADDRESS.                                           Ivi

times as great as that calculated in the usual suppositions of the conductive

power of the terrestrial mass at enormous depths, being no greater than that

of the superficial sedimentary beds. Other modes of investigation which

Mr. Hopiiins has brought to bear on this question appear to lead to the

conclusion that the thiclcness of the earth's crust is much greater even than

that above stated. This would require us to assume that a part of the heat

in the crust is due to superficial and external, rather than central causes.

This does not bear directly against the doctrine of central heat, but shows

that only a part of the increase of temperature observed in mines and deep

wells is due to the outward flow of that heat.

   Touching those highly interesting branches of science, Botany and Zoology,

it may be considered presumptuous in me to off'er any remarks. I have,
however, not entirely neglected in my earlier days to inform myself of certain

portions of natural history, which cannot but be attractive to all who delight

Howin the wonderful beauties of natural objects.                                                           interesting is the organi-

zation of animals and plants; how admirably adapted to their different func-

tions and spheres of life ! They want nothing, yet have nothing superfluous.

Every organ is adapted perfectly to its functions ; and the researches of
Owen, Agassiz, Darwin, Hooker, Daubeny, Babington, and Jardiiie fully

illustrate the perfection of the animal and vegetable economy of nature.

   Two other important branches of scientific research, Geography and

Ethnology, have for some years been united, in this Association, in one

are much indebted to Sir Roderick Murchison, among other Members of the

Association, for its continued prosperity, and the high position it has

attained in public estimation. The spirit of enterprise, courage, and perse-

verence displayed by our travellers in all parts of the world have been

powerfully stimulated and well supported by the Geographical Society ; and
the prominence and rapid publicity given to discoveries by that body have

largely promoted geographical research.

In Physical Geography the late Baron von Humboldt has been one of the

largest contributors, and we are chiefly indebted to his personal researches
and numerous writings for the elevated position it now holds among the
sciences. To Humboldt we owe our knowledge of the physical features of

Central and Southern America. To Parry, Sir James Ross, and Scoresby,
we are indebted for discoveries in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Geo-
graphy has also been advanced by the first voyage of Franklin down the
Copper Mine River, and along the inhospitable shores of the Northern Seas,

as far as Point Turn  Again                                                                      as also by that ill-fated  expedition  in search of

stimulated by the untiring energy of a high-minded woman. In addition to

these, the discoveries of Dr. Livingstone in Africa have opened to us a wide

field of future enterprise along the banks of the Zambesi and its tributaries.
To these we may add the explorations of Captain Burton in the same con-

tinent; and those also by Captain Speke and Captain Grant, of a hitherto
unknown region, in which it has been suggested that the White Nile has its

source, flowing from one of two immense lakes, upwards of 300 miles long

by 100 broad, and situated at an elevation of 4000 feet above the sea. To

these remarkable discoveries I ought to add an honourable mention of the

sagacious and perilous exploration of Central and Northern Australia by
Mr. M'Dougall Stuart.

Having glanced, however imperfectly, at some of the most important

branches of science which engage the attention of Members of this Associa-
Iviii  --REPORT 1861.

tion, I would now invite attention to the mechanical sciences, with which I
am more familiarly acquainted. They may be divided into Theoretical
Mechanics and Dynamics, comprising the conditions of equilibrium and the

laws of motion; and Applied Mechanics, relating to the construction of
machines. I have already observed that practice and theory are twin sisters,
and must work together to ensure a steady progress in mechanical art. Let
us then maintain this union as the best and safest basis of national progress,
and, moreover, let us recognize it as one of the distinctive aims of the annual

reunions of this Association.

   During the last century, the science of Applied Mechanics has made
strides which astonish us by tlieir magnitude ; but even these, it may reason-
ably be hoped, are but the promise of future and more wonderful enlarge-

ments. I therefore propose to offer a succinct history of these improvements,
as an instance of the influence of scientific progress on the well-being of
society. I shall take in review the three chief aids which engineering science
has afforded to national progress, namely, canals, steam-navigation, and rail-
ways ; each of which has promoted an incalculable extension of the industrial

resources of the country.

   One hundred years ago, the only means for the conveyance of inland
merchandize were the pack-horses and waggons on the then imperfect high-

ways. It was reserved for Brindley, Smeaton, and others to introduce a
system of canals, which opened up facilities for an interchange of commo-
dities at a cheap rate over almost every part of the country. The impetus
given to industrial operations by this new system of conveyance induced
capitalists to embark in trade, in mining, and in the extension of manufac-
tures in almost every district. These improvements continued for a series of
years, until the whole country was intersected by canals requisite to meet
the demands of a greatly extended industry. But canals, however well
adapted for the transport of minerals and merchandise, were less suited for
the conveyance of passengers. The speed of the canal-boats seldom
exceeded from two and a half to three miles an hour; and in addition to this,
the projectors of canals sometimes sought to take an unfair advantage of the

Act of Parliament, which fixed the tariff at so much per ton per mile, by

 adopting circuitous routes, under the erroneous impression that mileage was

 a consideration of great importance to the success of such undertakings. It

 is in consequence of short-sighted views and imperfect legislation that we

 inherit the numerous curves and distortions of our canal system.

     These defects in construction rendered canals almost useless for the con-

 veyance of passengers, and led to the improvement of the common roads

 and the system of stage coaches; so that before the year 1830 the chief

 public highways of the country had attained a remarkable smoothness and

 perfection, and the lightness of our carriages and the celerity vvith which

 they were driven still excites the admiration of those who remember them.

 These days of an efficiently worked system, which tasked the power and
 speed of the horse to the utmost, have now been succeeded by changes more
 wonderful than any that previously occurred in the history of the human

 race.

     Scarcely had the canal system been fully developed when a new means of

 propulsion was adopted, namely, steam. I need not recount to you the

 enterprise, skill, and labour that have been exerted in connexion with steam

 navigation. You have seen its results on every river and every sea ; results
 we owe to the fruitful minds of Miller, Symington, Fulton, and Henry Bell,

 vrho were the pioneers in the great march of progress.

     Viewing the past, with a knowledge of the present and a prospect of the
ADDRESS.  lix

future, it is difficult to estimate sufficiently the benefits that have been con-
ferred by this application of mechanical science to the purposes of navigation.
Power, speed, and certainty of action have been attained on the most

gigantic scale. The celerity with which a modern steamer, with a thousand
tons of merchandise and some hundreds of human beings on board, cleaves

the water and pursues her course, far surpasses the most sanguine expecta-
tions of a quarter of a century ago, and indeed almost rivals the speed of the
locomotive itself. Previous to 1812 our intercourse with foreign countries
and with our colonial possessions depended entirely upon the state of the
weather. It was only in favourable seasons that a passage was open, and

we had often to wait days, or even a week, before Dublin could be reached

from Holyhead. Now this distance of sixty-three miles is accomplished in

all weathers in little more than three hours. The passage to America used
to occupy six weeks or two months ; now it is accomplished in eight or nine
days. The passage round the Cape to India is reduced from nearly half a
year to less than a third of that time, whilst that country may be reached by
the overland route in less than a month. These are a few of the benefits
derived from steam-navigation ; and as it is yet far from perfect, we may

reasonably calculate on still greater advantages in our intercourse with distant

nations.

    I will not here enter upon the subject of the numerous improvements
which have so rapidly advanced the progress of this important service.
Suffice it to observe that the paddle-wheel system of propulsion has main-
tained its superiority over every other method yet adopted for the attainment
of speed, as by it the best results are obtained with the least expenditure of
power. In ships of war the screw is indispensable, on account of the security
it affords to the engines and machinery, from their position in the hold below
the water-line, and because of the facility it offers in the use of sails, when

the screw is raised from its position in the well to a recess in the stern pre-
pared for that purpose. It is also preferable in ships which require auxiliary
power in calms and adverse winds, so as to expedite the voyage and effect a
considerable saving upon the freight.

   The public mind had scarcely recovered itself from the changes which
steam-navigation had caused, and the impulse it had given to commerce,
when a new and even more gigantic power of locomotion was inaugurated.

Less than a quarter of a century had elapsed since the first steam-boats

floated on the waters of the Hudson and the Clyde, when the achievements
thence resulting were followed by the application of the same agency to the
almost superhuman flight of the locomotive and its attendant train. I well
remember the competition at Ilairihill in 1830, and the incredulity every-
where evinced at the proposal to run locomotives at twenty miles an hour.
Neither George Stephenson himself, nor any one else, had at that time the
most distant idea of the capabilities of the railway system. On the contrary,
it was generally considered impossible to exceed ten or twelve miles an hour;
and our present high velocities, due to high-pressure steam and the tubular

system of boilers, have surpassed the most sanguine expectations of

engineers. The sagacity of George Stephenson at once seized upon the
suggestion of Henry Booth, to employ tubular boilers; and that, united to
the blast-pipe, previously known, has been the means of effecting all the
wonders we now witness in a system that has done more for the develop-
ment of practical science and the civilization of man than any discovery
since the days of Adam.

   From a consideration of the changes which have been effected in the
means for the interchange of commodities, I pass on to examine the progress
--Ix REPORT 1861.

which has been made in their production. And as the steam-engine has

been the basis of all our modern manufacturing industry, I shall glance at

the steps by which it has been perfected.
   Passing over the somewhat mythical fame of the Marquis of Worcester,

and the labours of Savery, Beigfiton, and Newcomen, we come at once to
discuss the state of mechanical art at the time when James Watt brought his
gigantic powers to the improvement of the steam-engine. At that time the
tools were of the rudest construction, nearly everything being done by hand,
and, in consequence, wood was much more extensively employed than iron.
Under these circumstances Watt invented separate condensation, rendered

the engine double-acting, and converted its rectilinear motion into a circular
one suitable for the purposes of manufacture. But the discovery at first
made little way ; the public did not understand it ; and a series of years
elapsed before the difficulties, commercial and mechanical, which opposed its

application, could be overcome. When the certainty of success had been

demonstrated, Watt was harassed by infringements of his patent, and law-

suits for the maintenance of his rights. Inventors and pretended inventors
set up claims, and entered into combination with manufacturers, miners, and
others, to destroy the patent, and deprive him of the just fruits of his labour
and genius. Such is the selfish heartlessness of mankind in dealing with

discoveries not their own, but from which they expect to derive benefit.

The steam-engine, since it was introduced by Watt, has changed our

habits in almost every condition of life. Things which were luxuries have

become necessaries ; and it has given to the poor man, in all countries in
which it exists, a degree of comfort and independence, and a participation
in intellectual culture unknown before its introduction. It has increased

our manufactures tenfold, and has lessened the barriers which time and space

interpose. It ploughs the land, and winnows and grinds the corn. It spins

and weaves our textile fabrics. In mining it pumps, winds, and crushes the

ores. It performs these things with powers so great and so energetic as to

astonish us at their immensity, whilst they are at the same time perfectly

docile, and completely under human control.

In war it furnishes the means of aggression, as in peace it affords the bonds

of conciliation ; and, in fact, places within reach a power which, properly

applied, produces harmony and goodwill among men, and leads to the

Wehappiest results in every condition of human existence.  may, therefore,

well be proud of the honour conferred on this country as the cradle of its

origin, and as having fostered its development from its earliest applications

to its present hig.'i state of perfection.

I cannot conclude this notice of the steam-engine without observing the

changes it is destined to effect in the cultivation of the soil. It is but a

short time since it was thought inapplicable to agricultural purposes, from

its great weight and expense. But more recent experience has proved this

to be a mistake, and already in most districts we find that it has been pressed

into the service of the farm. The small locomotive, mounted on a frame with

four wheels, travels from village to village with its attendant, the thrashing-

machine, performing the operations of thrashing, winnowing, and cleaning

at less than one-half the cost by the old and tedious process of hand labour.

myIts application to ploughing and tillage on a large scale is, in  opinion,

still in its infancy, and I doubt not that many Members of this Association

will live to see the steam-plough in operation over the whole length

and breadth of the land. Much has to be done before this important

change can be successfully accomplished ; but, with the aid of the agri-

culturist preparing the land so as to meet the requirements of steam-
ADDRESS.  Ixi

machinery, we may reasonably look forward to a new era in the cultivation

of the soil.

   The extraordinary developments of practical science in our system of

textile manufacture are, however, not entirely due to the steam-engine,

although they are now in a great measure dependent on it. The machinery

of these manufactures had its origin before the steam-engine had been applied,
except for mining purposes; and the inventions of Arkwright, Hargreaves,
and Crompton were not conceived under the impression that steam would

be their moving power. On the contrary, they depended upon water; and

the cotton-machinery of this district had attained considerable perfection
before steam came to the aid of the manufacturer, and ultimately enabled
him to increase the production to its present enormous extent.

   I shall not attempt a description of the machinery of the textile manufac-
tures, because ocular inspection will be far more acceptable. I can only

refer you to a list of establishments in which you may examine their opera-
tions on a large scale, and which I earnestly recommend to your attention.
I may, however, advert to a few of the improvements which have marked

the progress of the manufacturing system in this country.

   When Arkwright patented his water-frames in 1767, the annual consump-

--tion of cotton was about four million pounds weight. Now it is one thousand

two hundred million pounds weight, three hundred times as much. Within
half a century the number of spindles at work, spinning cotton alone, has
increased tenfold ; whilst, by superior mechanism, each spindle produces
fifty per cent, more yarn than on the old system. Hence the importance to
which the cotton trade has risen, equalling at the present time the whole
revenue of the three kingdoms, or £70,000,000 sterling per annum. As late
as 1820 the power-loom was not in existence, now it produces about fourteen
million yards of cloth, or, in more familiar terms, nearly eight thousand
miles of cloth per diem. I give these numbers to show the immense poM'er
of production of this country, and to afford some conception of the number
and quality of the machines which effect such wonderful results.

    Mule-spinning was introduced by Crompton, in 1787, with about twenty
spindles to each machine. The powers of the machine were, however,
rapidly increased ; and now it has been so perfected that two thousand or
even three thousand spindles are directed by a single person. At first the
winding on, or forming the shape of the cop, was performed by hand ; but

this has been superseded by rendering the machine automatic, so that it now

performs the whole operation of drawing, stretching, and twisting the thread,

and winding it on to the exact form, ready for the reel or shuttle as may be

required. These, and other improvements in carding, roving, combing, spin-

ning, and weaving have established in this country an entirely new system of
industry ; it has given employment to greatly increased numbers, and a more

intelligent class of work-people.

    Similarly important improvements have been applied to the machinery

employed in the manufacture of silk, flax, and wool ; and we have only to

watch the processes in these different departments to be convinced that they

owe much to the development of the cotton manufacture. In the manufac-

ture of worsted, the spinning jenny was not employed at Bradford until 1790,
nor the power loom until about 1825. The production of fancy or mixed
goods from alpaca and mohair wool, introduced to this country in 1836, is
perhaps the most striking example of a new creation in the art of manufac-
ture, and is chiefly due to Mr. Titus Salt, in whose immense palace of
industry, at Saltaire, it may be seen in the greatest perfection. In flax
machinery the late Sir Peter Fairbairn was one of the most successful
--Ixii REPORT 1861.

inventors, and his improvements have contributed to the rapid extension of

this manufacture.

I might greatly extend this description of our manufacturing industry,

but 1 must for the present be brief, in order to point out the dependence of

all these improvements on the iron and coal so widely distributed amongst
Wethe mineral treasures of our island.
                                        are highly favoured in the abun-

dance of these minerals, deposited with an unsparing hand by the great

Author of nature, under so slight a covering as to bring them within reach

of the miner's art. To them we owe our present high state of perfection in

the useful arts ; and to their extended application we may safely attribute

our national progress and wealth. So that, looking to the many blessings

which we daily and hourly receive from these sources alone, we are impressed

with devotional feelings of gratitude to the Almighty for the manifold

bounties He has bestowed upon us.

Previously to the inventions of Henry Cort, the manufacture of wrought

Airon was of the most crude and primitive description.  hearth and a pair

of bellows was all that was employed. But since the introduction of

puddling, the iron-masters have increased the production to an extraordinary

extent, down to the present time, when processes for the direct conversion

Aof wrought iron on a large scale are being attempted.  consecutive series

of chemical researches into the different processes, from the calcining of the

ore to the production of the bar, carried on by Dr. Percy and others, has led

to a revolution in the manufacture of iron ; and although it is at the present

moment in a state of transition, it nevertheless requires no very great dis-

cernment to perceive that steel and iron of any required tenacity will be

made in the same furnace, with a facility and certainty never before attained.

This has been effected, to some extent, by improvements in puddling; but

the process of Mr. Bessemer, first made known at the meetings of this

Association at Cheltenham, affords the highest promise of certainty and

perfection in the operation of converting the melted pig direct into steel or

iron, and is likely to lead to the most important developments in this manu-

facture. These improvements in the production of the material must, in

their turn, stimulate its application on a larger scale and lead to new con-

structions.

   In iron shipbuilding, an immense field is open before us. Our wooden

walls have, to all appearance, seen their last days ; and as one of the early

pioneers in iron construction, as applied to shipbuilding, I am highly gratified

to witness a change of opinion that augurs well for the security of the

liberties of the country. From the commencement of iron shipbuilding in

1830 to the present time, there could be only one opinion amongst those
best acquainted with the subject, namely, that iron must eventually supersede
timber in every form of naval construction. The large ocean steamers, the

' Himalaya,' the ' Persia,' and the ' Great Eastern,' abundantly show what
can be done with iron ; and we have only to look at the new system of casing
ships with armour-plates, to be convinced that we can no longer build
wooden vessels of war with safety to our naval superiority and the best

interests of the country. I give no opinion as to the details of the recon-

-- --struction of the navj', that is reserved for another place, but I may state

that I am fully persuaded that the whole of our ships of war must be rebuilt

of iron, and defended with iron armour calculated to resist projectiles of the

heaviest description at high velocities.

   In the early stages of iron shipbuilding, I believe I was the first to show,
by a long series of experiments, the superiority of wrought iron over every
other description of material in security and strength, when judiciously
                          ADDRESS.                                Ixiii

applied in the construction of ships of every class. Other considerations,

however, affect the question of vessels of war; and although numerous

experiments were made, yet none of the targets were on a scale sufficient
to resist more than a six-pounder shot. It was reserved for our scientific

neighbours, the French, to introduce thick iron plates as a defensive armour
for ships. The success which has attended the adoption of this new system

of defence affords the prospect of invulnerable ships of war, and hence the

desire of the Government to remodel the navy on an entirely new principle

of construction, in order that we may retain its superiority as the great

Abulwarks of the nation.  committee has been appointed by the War Office

and the Admiralty for the purpose of carrying out a scientific investigation

of the subject, so as to determine, first, the ;best description of material to

resist projectiles; secondly, the best method of fastening and applying that

material to the sides of ships and land fortifications ; and, lastly, the thick-

ness necessary to resist the different descriptions of ordnance.

It is asserted, probably with trutii, that whatever thickness of plates are

adopted for casing ships, guns will be constructed capable of destroying

them. But their destruction will even then be a work of time ; and I believe,

from what I have seen in recent experiments, that with proper armour it

will require, not only the most powerful ordnance, but also a great concen-

tration of fire, before fracture will ensue. If this be the case, a well-con-

structed iron ship, covered with sound [)lates of the proper thickness, firmly

attached to its sides, will, for a considerable time, resist the heaviest guns

which can be brought to bear against it, and be practically shot-proof. But

our present means are inadequate for the production of large masses of

iron, and we may trust that, with new tools and machinery, and the skill,

energy, and perseverance of our manufacturers, every difficulty will be

overcome, and armour-plates produced which will resist the heaviest existing

ordnance.

The rifling of heavy ordnance, the introduction of wrought iron, and the

new principle of construction with strained hoops, have given to all countries

the means of increasing enormously the destructive power of their ordnance.

One of the results of this introduction of wrought iron, and correct principles

of manufacture, is the reduction of the weight of the new guns to about

two-thirds the weight of the older cast-iron ordnance. Hence follows the

facility with which guns of much greater power can be worked, whilst the

range and precision of fire are at the same time increased. But these

improvements cannot be confined to ourselves. Other nations are increasing

the power and range of their artillery in a similar degree, and the energies

of the nation must therefore be directed to maintain the superiority of our

navy in armour as well as in armament.

  We have already seen a new era in the history of the construction of

bridges, resulting from the use of iron ; and we have only to examine those

of the tubular form over the Conway and Menai Straits to be convinced of

the durability, strength, and lightness of tubular constructions applied to the

support of railways or common roads, in spans which, ten years ago, were

considered beyond the reach of human skill. When it is considered that

stone bridges do not exceed 200 feet in span, nor cast-iron bridges 250 feet,

we can estimate the progress which has been made in crossing rivers 400 or
500 feet in width, without any support at the middle of the stream. Even

spans, greatly in excess of this, may be bridged over with safety, provided

we do not exceed 1800 to 2000 feet, when the structure would be destroyed

by its own weight.

It is to the exactitude and accuracy of our machine tools that our
--Ixiv
               REPORT 1861.

machinery of tlie present time owes its smoothness of motion and certainty

of action. When I first entered this city, the whole of the machinery was

executed by hand. There were neither planing, slotting, nor shaping
machines, and, with the exception of very imperfect lathes and a few drills,
the preparatory operations of construction were effected entirely by the

hands of the workmen. Now everything is done by machine tools, with a

degree of accuracy which the unaided hand could never accomplish. The

automaton, or self-acting machine tool, has within itself an almost creative
power; in fact, so great are its powers of adaptation, that there is no opera-

tion of the human hand that it does not imitate. For many of these improve-

ments, the country is indebted to the genius of our townsmen, Mr. Richard
Roberts and Mr. Joseph Whitworth. The importance of these constructive
machines is, moreover, strikingly exemplified in the Government works at
Woolwich and Enfield Lock, chiefly arranged under the direction of
Mr. Anderson, the present inspector of machinery, to whose skill and

ingenuity the country is greatly indebted for the efficient state of those great

arsenals.

Amongst the changes which have largely contributed to the comfort and

enjoyment of life, are the improvements in the sanitary condition of towns.

These belong, probably, to the province of social rather than mechanical
science ; but I cannot omit noticing some of the great works that have of
late years been constructed for the supply of water, and for the drainage of

towns. In former days, ten gallons of water to each person per day was

considered an ample allowance. Now thirty gallons is much nearer the rate

of consumption. I may instance the water-works of this city and of Liver-

pool, each of which yield a supply of from twenty to thirty gallons of water

to each inhabitant. In the former case, the water is collected from the

Cheshire and Derbyshire Hills, and, after being conveyed in tunnels and

aqueducts a distance of ten miles to a reservoir, where it is strained and

purified, it is ultimately taken a further distance of eight miles in pipes, in

a perfectly pure state, ready for distribution. The greatest undertaking of

this kind, however, yet accomplished, is that by which the pure waters of
Loch Katrine are distributed to the city of Glasgow. This work, recently

completed by Mr. Bateman, who was also the constructor of the water-works

of this city, is of the most gigantic character, the water being conveyed in a

covered tunnel a distance of twenty-seven miles, through an almost impass-

able country, to the service reservoir, about eight miles from Glasgow. By

this means forty million gallons of water per day are conveyed through the

hills which flank Ben Lomond, and after traversing the sides of Loch Chon

and Loch Aird, are finally discharged into the Mugdock basin, where the

Wewater is impounded for distribution.  may reasonably look forward to

an extension of similar benefits to the metropolis, by the same engineer,

whose energies are now directed to an examination of the pure fountains of

Wales, from whence the future supply of water to the great city is likely to

Abe derived.   work of so gigantic a character may be looked upon as

problematical; but when it is known that six or seven millions of money

would be sufficient for its execution, I can see no reason why an undertaking
of so much consequence to the health of London should not ultimately be

accomplished.

    In leaving this subject, I cannot refrain from an expression of deep regret
at the loss which science has sustained through the death of one of our

"Vice-Presidents, the late Professor Hodgkinson. For a long series of years
he and I worked together in the same field of scientific research, and our
labours are recorded in the Transactions of this and other Associations.
                            ADDRESS.                                    IxV

To Mr. Hodgkinson we owe the determination of the true form of cast-iron

beams, or section of greatest strength ; the law of the elasticity of iron under

tensile and compressive forces; and the laws of resistance of columns to

compression. I look back to the days of our joint labour with unalloyed

pleasure and satisfaction.  *

I regret to say that another of our Vice-Presidents, my friend Mr. Joseph

Whitworth, is unable to be present with us through serious, but I hope not

dangerous, illness. To Mr. Whitworth mechanical science is indebted for

some of the most accurate and delicate pieces of mechanism ever executed ;
and the exactitude he has introduced into every mechanical operation will

long continue to be the admiration of posterity. His system of screw-

Wethreads and gauges is now in general use throughout Europe.  owe to

him a machine for measuring with accuracy to the millionth of an inch,

employed in the production of standard gauges; and his laborious and

interesting experiments on rifled ordnance have resulted in the production

of a rifled small-arm and gun which have never been surpassed for range

and precision of fire. It is with pain that I have to refer to the cause which

deprives me of his presence and support at this meeting.

  A brief allusion must be made to that marvellous discovery which has

--given to the present generation the power to turn the spark of heaven to the

uses of speech to transmit along the slender wire for a thousand miles a

current of electricity that renders intelligible words and thoughts. This

wonderful discovery, so familiar to us, and so useful in our communications

to every part of the globe, we owe to Wheatstone, Thomson, De la Rive,

and others. In land-telegraphy the chief difficulties have been surmounted,

but in submarine telegraphy much remains to be accomplished. Failures

have been repeated so often as to call for a Commission on the part of the

Government to inquire into the causes, and the best means of overcom-

ing the difliculties which present themselves. I had the honour to serve on

that Commission, and I believe that from the report, and mass of evidence and

experimental research accumulated, the public will derive very important

information. It is well known that three conditions are essential to success

--in the construction of ocean telegraphs perfect insulation, external protec-

tion, and appropriate apparatus for laying the cable safely on its ocean bed.

That we are far from having succeeded in fulfilling these conditions is

evident from the fact that out of twelve thousand miles of submarine cable

which have been laid since 1851, only three thousand miles are actually in

working order ; so that three-fourths may be considered as a failure and loss
to the country. The insulators hitherto employed are subject to deteriora-

tion from mechanical violence, from chemical decomposition or decay, and

from the absorption of water ; but the last circumstance does not appear to

influence seriously the durability of cables. Electrically, india-rubber

possesses high advantages, and, next to it, Wray's compound and pure gutta-
percha far surpass the commercial gutta-percha hitherto employed ; but it
remains to be seen whether the mechanical and commercial ditticulties in
the employment of these new materials can be successfully overcome. The

external protecting covering is still a subject of anxious consideration. The

Hempobjections to iron wire are its weight and liability to corrosion.  has

been substituted, but at present with no satisfactory result. All these diffi-

culties, together with those connected with the coiling and paying out of

the cable, will no doubt yield to careful experiment and the employment of

proper instruments in its construction and its final deposit on the bed of

the ocean.

Irrespective of inland and international telegraphy, a new system of com-

munication has been introduced by Professor Wheatstone, whereby inter-

course can be carried on between private families, public offices, and the
works of merchants and manufacturers. This application of electric currents
cannot be too highly appreciated, from its great efficiency and compara-

tively small expense. To show to what an extent this improvement has
been carried, I may state that Aie thousand wires, in a perfect state of
insulation, may be formed into a rope not exceeding half an inch in

diameter.

   I must not sit down without directing attention to a subject of deep
importance to all classes, namely, the amount of protection inventors should
receive from the laws of the country. It is the opinion of many that patent
laws are injurious rather than beneficial, and that no legal protection of this

kind ought to be granted ; in fact, that a free trade in inventions, as in

everything else, should be established. I confess I am not of that opinion.

Doubtless there are abuses in the working of the patent law as it at present
exists, and protection is often granted to pirates and impostors, to the detri-
ment of real inventors. This, however, does not contravene the principle
of protection, but rather calls for reform and amendment. It is asserted by
those who have done the least to benefit their country by inventions, that a
monopoly is injurious, and that if the patent laws are defended, it should be,
not on the ground of their benefit to the inventor, but on that of their utility
to the nation. I believe this to be a dangerous doctrine, and I hope it will

never be acted upon. I cannot see the right of the nation to appropriate

the labours of a lifetime, without awarding remuneration. The nation, in

this case, receives a benefit ; and assuredly the labourer is worthy of his

hire. I am no friend of monopoly, but neither am I a friend of injustice;

and I think that before the public are benefited by an invention, the
inventor should be rewarded either by a fourteen years' monopoly or in
some other way. Our patent laws are defective, so far as they protect

pretended inventions ; but they are essential to the best interests of the
State in stimulating the exertions of a class of eminent men, such as
Arkwright, Watt, and Crompton, whose inventions have entailed upon all

countries invaluable benefits, and have done honour to the human race. To

this Association is committed the task of correcting the abuses of the present

system, and establishing such legal provisions as shall deal out equal justice

to the inventor and the nation at large.

   1 must not forget that we owe very much to an entirely new and most

attractive method of diff"using knowledge, admirably exemplified in the
Great Exhibition of 185J, and its successors in France, Ireland, and America.
Most of us remember the gems of art which were accumulated in this city
during the summer of 1857, and the wonderful results they produced on all
classes of the community. The improvement of taste and the increase of

practical knowledge which followed these exhibitions have been deeply felt

and hence the prospects which are now opening before us in regard to the
Exhibition of the next year cannot be too highly appreciated. That Exhi-

bition will embrace the whole circle of the sciences, and is likely to elevate

the general culture of the public to a higher standard than we have ever
before attained. There will be unfolded almost every known production of

art, every ingenious contrivance in machinery, and the results of discoveries

in science from the earliest period. The Fine Arts, which constituted no

part of the Exhibition of 18.51, and which were only partially represented at

Paris and Dublin, will be illustrated by new creations from the most dis-
tinguished masters of the modern school. Looking forwards, I venture to

--hope for a great success and a further development of the principle advo-

cated by this Association the union of science and art.
ADDRESS.      Ixvii

   In conclusion, my apologies are due to you for the length of this address,

and I thank you sincerely for the patient attention with which you have

listened to the remarks I have had the honour to lay before you. As the

President of the British Association, I feel that, far beyond the consideration

of merely personal qualifications, my election was intended as a compliment

to practical science, and to this great and influential metropolis of manufac-

ture, where those who cultivate the theory of science may witness, on its

grandest scale, its application to the industrial arts. As a citizen of Man.

Chester, I venture to assure the Association that its intentions are appreciated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

and to its members, as well as to the strangers who have been attracted here

by this meeting, I offer a most cordial welcome.

                                   ON

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1860-61. By a Com-
   mittee, consisting of James Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S., of the Royal

    Observatory, Greenwich, Secretary to the British Meteorological

   Society, S^c. ; J. H. Gladstone, Esq., Ph.D., F.R.S. ^c. ; R. P.
   Greg, Esq., F.G.S. ^c. ; and E. J. Lowe, Esq., F.R.A.S.,

   M.B.M.S. 8(C.

The Committee, in presenting this report upon the Luminous Meteors of

the past year, feel that the arrangement for collecting this information is far

from perfect, as for the most part the number of observers, Members of the
Association, who have sent observations are very few indeed.

   During the entire year 1 860 the number of meteors were few, and the sky
during the nights of both the August and November epochs was generally
overcast over the whole country, and scarcely any meteors were seen.

   In the August just passed, the sky for the most part was clear, and many

meteors were observed.
    It was stated in the Report for last year, that the remarkable meteor of

March 10, 1860, must have been seen by many persons, and it seems to have
been so, but no observations were taken by them of elevation, direction, &c.
and we are not in possession, even now, of sufficient information upon which

to base calculations.

    In the Catalogue of Meteors observed this year, of one alone have accounts

by three observers been received, that of July 16, 1861, as seen by the Duke of
Argyll, at Kensington ; Mr. Frost, at the Isle of Wight; and Mr. Howe, at

Greenwich : the three observers agree as to the place of its origin, viz. near

a Lyrae, but Mr. Howe says it moved towards the N.E., whilst Mr. Frost

says its motion was towards the S.W., just in opposite directions to each
other*. Another meteor, that of August 6, at 11.15, was seen by two ob-
servers ; the one at Manchester, the other near Macclesfield, but in neither

case are sufficient data recorded.

    The Committee regret that but one account of all the remaining meteors
in the catalogue has been received, and nothing can therefore be added to the

observations themselves.

* This was also probably the one seen at Tunbridge Wells, at Darlington in Yorkshire,

and at Namur in Flanders, and of which an approximate orbit has been calculated by Mr.

Alexander S. Herschell. (See Appendix, No. 3.)

 --No. 1. A large meteor, October 25tl), 18.59, was seen at Holyhead,

Anglesea; and at Ballinaman, 13 miles west of Athlune, in Ireland.

  --1. As seen by Mr. Harris, C.E., at Holyhead. At about 7.13 p.m. a bright

ball of fire appeared directly overhead, illuminating the dense masses of"
vapour which filled the sky at the time, and rendering objects around as

visible as if by day. The appearance lasted two or three seconds; it was
blowing nearly a gale at the time, and immediately after the rain came down

like a deluge.

--No, 2. The following accounts of the remarkable meteor of June 1 1 th,

1845, of which some descriptions have already been published in preceding

Reports, have been forwarded to us, as first seen by the Rev. F. Hawletr,

F.R.A.S., near Adalia, Asia Minor:

   1. Towards the close of the 18th we started, after one of the sultriest days
I almost ever experienced; at 11 a.m. the thermometer was 98° in the coolest

part of Mr. Purdie's house, whilst not a breath of wind was astir. I know

not whether the stagnant heat may have contributed to the occurrence of a

Wevery splendid meteor which we witnessed that evening.  had entered the

mountainous district north-west of Adalia, the sun had recently set in a per-

fectly cloudless sky, and the twilight was coming on, when there suddenly burst

out in the north a meteor that resembled in appearance a bright but perma-

nent flash of lightning, whose upper extremity lay a little to the east of the

pole-star. The length of the flasii, as near as I could judge, was about 50°

certainly more than half the space between the zenith and the horizon

(sloping downwards towards the west of north) ; and that M'hich I presumed

was the vapour resulting from the explosion presented for several minutes

the same shape as the original flash, and being strongly illumined (as I took

it) by the upslanting rays of the vanished sun, appeared about the bright-

ness of the rising moon, which was then about at the full. Absorbed as we

all were by the magnificence of the spectacle, which elicited from the Turks

repeated cries of "Allah, Allah," 1 forgot to note by my watch the time whicli

might elapse until an explosion should be audible, and was only reminded of

the omission upon hearing a dull heavy report like that of a distant piece of

ordnance boom on ray ear, after an interval we then judged of some 7 or 8

minutes. According to this estimate, the sound, if it came to us from the

meteor, and which (it was so peculiar) I think was the case, must have

travelled to us from a distance of 90 miles (sound travelling 1140 feet per

second), and owing to the altitude of the meteor must have had its origin in

the highest and rarest regions of our atmosphere.

This brilliant visitant gradually appeared to grow larger and more diffuse,

as to breadth more particularly, and at last to break up into detached por-

tions, which were beautifully decked in luminous colours of red, orange, and

silvery green. Finally the coloured portions, having taken meanwhile a

slightly westerly course, by degrees faded away, having continued visible at

Weleast 20 minutes to half an hour.      were informed that the meteor was

sc'^n at Philadelphia (160 miles west).

2. From ' Malta Mail.'

   The brig 'Victoria' saw this extraordinary appearance when in latitude

36° 40' 56" north, and longitude 13° 44' 36" east, being becalmed and without

any appearance of bad weather ; her topgallant and royal masts suddenly

went over the side, as if carried away by a sudden squall; and two hours after

it blew very hard from south and east, but suddenly again fell calm, with an

overpowering stench of sulphur and an unbearable heat. At this moment three

luminous bodies were seen to issue from the sea at the distance of about half

a mile from the vessel, which remained visible for about 10 minutes ; soon
after it came on to blow hard from the south-east, and the vessel ran into a

current of air the reverse of that just experienced (900 miles west of Adalia).

   3. Letter from Amab, on Mount Lebanon.

   On the same day, about half an hour after sunset (very nearly the same

Atime), the heavens presented an extraordinary and beautiful appearance.

fiery meteor, composed of two luminous bodies, each appearing at least five
times larger than the moon, with streamers and appendages to each, joining

the two, and looking like large flags blown out by a gentle breeze, appeared in
A CATALOGUE OP OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOT?S METEORS. 31

the west, remained visible for an hour, and taking an easterly course gradually

disappeared. The appendages appeared to shine from the reflected light of
the main bodies, which it was painful to look at for any length of time. The
moon had risen half an hour before, and there was scarcely any wind (350

miles south-east of Adalia).

   Accounts from Erzeroum, in Asia Minor, describe a sudden fall of the

thermometer on June 21st (three days after), which usually ranges in summer
between 20° and 22° Reaumur, to 5°, and a further fall of two more degrees

during a heavy snow-storm which lasted three days, after which the thermo-

meter suddenly rose to 21°. The greatest consternation prevailed among
the inhabitants, who thought the wqrld was coming to an end.

   At Malta the heat was excessively oppressive, the thermometer ranging
from 87° indoors in shade to 140° exposed to the hot air. At St. Antonio,

the coolest spot in the island, the governor was compelled to rig up Indian
punkahs and order an extra supply of ice*.

--No. 3. The following additional notice of the meteor of July 16th has

recently appeared in the 'London Review' of August 10th, 1861, written

by Mr. Alexander S. Herschel :

" Excellent observations at Tunbridge Wells, and at Darlington, in York-

shire, afford the following conclusions upon the orbit of the first meteor of

Tuesday evening, the 16th of July. If this were not an electrical phe-

nomenon of extraordinary magnificence, it came from space as a body of one-

third of a mile in diameter, drawn towards our sun from some initial path,

in which it must have had a native velocity of at least twenty-three miles a

second (exceeding by four miles that of our earth in her orbit). The meteor

first became visible 320 miles above Namur (in the south of Flanders), and in-

clined downwards at 20° to about 100 miles above the North Sea, 250 miles

due east of Perth, where it suddenly disappeared, soon after separating into

two parts. The whole course of 500 miles was performed in 10 to 12 seconds

of time                              and  if  we neglect the  action  of the  earth,  which  can  only  deflect  a
                                  ;

satellite 3° in a minute, the path was from over the head of Sagittarius, and

presents a direct hyperbolic orbit of eccentricity of 1*1 1°, and obliquity 45°,

leading from the descending node (where it encountered the earth) to an

apse at 156° in advance along its course, and within 16,000,000 miles of the

sun."

 --Note. The time of this meteor is not given by Mr. Herschel in this

notice, but he speaks of it as the first meteor seen that evening ; it is very

possible that this was the one seen also at Greenwich, the Isle of Wight, and

Kensington, about 11 p.m., though it does not appear to be quite clear. It

may be observed that large meteors seem to have been not unfrequently

observed about the 17th of July. An observed altitude of 320 miles for a

meteor is most unusual. Though it is true, as observed by Mr. Herschel, and

proved by elaborate calculations by Walker (see ' American Philosophical

Transactions' for 1841), that the influence of the earth's attraction is very

inconsiderable on passing meteors, yet in calculations on the real orbits of

meteors, taken generally from observations founded on positions more or less

within the limits of the atmosphere, it must not be forgotten that the elasti-

city of the atmosphere itself must have a tendency to make the meteor

deviate more or less from its true path, materially qualifying the elements of

its ellipticity, and rendering somewhat uncertain whether it is hyperbolic

or not.

         * Sir W. S. Han-is considers it probable this was an electrical phenomenon.
--32 REPORT 1861.

 --No. 4. 1. One of the most interesting falls of meteorites, and for a longtime

the only one of metallic iron which had been witnessed, took place at

Hraschina, near Agram, on May 26th, 1751. At a meeting of the Imperial
Academy of Vienna, April 14th, 1859, M. Haidinger produced the Latin

document referring to ic (wliich had never been published), and the original
German translation ; also a second document, lately discovered in the Impe-
rial Cabinet of Minerals at Vienna, accompanied by two plates representing

the phenomena as observed at Szigetvar (or Gross- Sziget), 75 miles east
of Hraschina. At a meeting held on February 3rd, 1860, he presented a
third document, discovered in the archiepiscopal library at Agram, describing
the same phenomena as seen atBiscupcez, near Warasdin, 17i miles north, a

little east of Hraschina.

   Prof. Haidinger also drew attention to the meteor seen on May 26, 1751,

between 6 and 7 p.m., west of Gross-Sziget. It was first observed as a flash

of light, without noise ; immediately afterwards it resembled a tortuous chain,

extending directly west, terminating in the middle heiglit of the air as a fire-

ball, leaving a long tail. On arriving in the lower strata it resembled an

enormous sparkling fireball, with a chain-like tail in the higher regions, the
last traces of whicli faded away at about 10 p.m. At Biscupecz ic was
observed as a small cloud from which some noise emanated, and which after-

wards disappeared*.

Two pieces of iron fell to the east of Hraschina, one of 71 lbs. penetrating

4 feet 6 inches into the ground, at present preserved in the Imperial Cabinet

of Vienna; the other of 16 lbs., which had been distributed partly at the

place of its fall, and afterwards at Presburg, every vestige of which is lost.

From the computations of various observations it appears to have passed from

Neustadt to Hraschina, or from north to south from 4-8° 35' to 40° 6' 2"; and

from west to east from 28° 18' to 34°, east of Ferro.

   No observations were taken of its velocity ; but its height before its fall at

--Hraschina, viewed from Szigetvar, was from 30° to 35° equal to about 43 to

52^ miles. Prof. Haidinger remarked upon the vast diff'erence between the
Aapparent size of the meteor and its solid contents.
                                                       body 15 inches in

diameter at 75 miles distance is invisible; yet the meteor is pictured as if of the

size of the sun. The appearance of the chain indicates the time when the

solid portions became visible ; they are, however, only the paths of the lumi-

nous bodies; and that they do not form straight lines is very natural, if we

take into consideration the flat shape of the meteorite, which must have been

tossed from side to side by the resistance of the air. If the rapid compres-

--sion of the air is sufficient to annul the cosmical velocity, it certainly can pro-

duce the elimination of light the fiery phenomena. These two points esta-

blished, as a natural consequence two phenomena result, which belong to

the character of fiery meteors. The solid nucleus of a meteor is not a globe ;

it passes undoubtedly through the resisting medium with its centre of gravity

foremost, producing, on account of the unequal distribution, a rotation of its

mass, which increases in rapidity, whilst the velocity of its motion diminishes

in a direct ratio.

   The report of the Hraschina meteor was heard as far as Warasdin, which,

taking Hraschina as a centre, gives an area of nearly 1000 square miles over
Avhich the sound was audible.

   The Hraschina iron was the first in M'liich the highly crystalline structure

of meteoric iron was observed, and Haidinger gives an account of the cir-
cumstances under which the discovery was made. Alvis von Widmannstiit-
ten, a highly educated and thorough iron-master, had a plate of the mass cut

ofF If by 1 inch in size and ^g oz. in weight ; this was carefully polished for
the purpose of examination when exposed to heat. But what a surprise I
After the colour of the principal mass had passed through the various shades

of straw-yellow, brownish-yellow, violet, and blue, there remained groups

--of triangles of straw-colour parallel lines, the blue and violet intervals I to

·I line wide, the straw-yellow lines ^ to ^ a splendid phenomenon. This was
the first observation, and the figures were called " Widmanstatten's figures,"

in honour of the discoverer. The method of etching by acids was introduced

--after this discovery.
    2. Leitform In a paper on a typical form of meteorites, presented at

the meeting of the Imperial Academy of Vienna, on April 19th, I860, by
Prof. Haidinger, he suggests some new and interesting ideas. The paper is

accompanied by two plates of the appearances of meteoric stones from Stan-

nern and Gross-Dwina, which are complete in themselves, and may be con-

sidered as individuals of their kind, which at the same time show distinctly

one of the periods through which they have passed.

   In viewing meteorites there must be a starting-point from some funda-
mental considerations proved by the phenomena themselves, in order to arrive

at an understanding of their forms and conditions. These are, 1st, the stone

leaving the extra-terrestrial space as a solid ; 2nd, its velocity being greater

on entering the earth's atmosphere ; 3rd, it is retarded by the resistance of
the air ; 4th, the " fireball " (or luminous envelope of the meteor) formed by

the compression of the air and the rotation of the stone resulting therefrom
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

5th, the termination of the first part of the path is marked by a detonation,
the so-called explosion, the vacuum inside of the fireball being suddenly filled
by the surrounding air.

The Stannern stone seems to have passed through the air with its rounded

side first, and shows over its surface effects resulting from a uniform action of

the atmosphere upon it whilst the crust was in a viscous state. The lustrous

crust is surrounded by a protruding gibbosity ; the stone had sharp edges

which in the foremost direction of the meteorite were melted off and blown

towards the back part. The time of the passage through the air generally
lasts only a few seconds. The rising temperature producing the crust belongs

to this period, since the stone came from the planetary space wiih a tempera-

ture of 100° C. below freezing-point. Some meteors get heated very rapidly

masses of iron will sometimes get red-hot whilst one composed of some other

substance will be quite cold inside ; and as soon as the detonation takes place,

and the fireball disappears, the inside and outside temperatures of the me-

teorites are soon counterbalanced and the crust rapidly cools, especially at a

height where the temperature is very low.

   The stone of Gross-Dwina, which in its general character is allied to those
of Timochin, Zebrak, and Eichstadt, shows a great dissimilarity on its two

principal planes, one being smooth, and the other rough. The form is that

of a fragment altered only on its surface. Characteristic of this meteorite is
a ridge which passes over the " head " of it; and corresponding with it there

was one passing over the back part of it. The roundish spots where a
melting off has commenced have a striking resemblance to the impressions of
figures in dough ; they are generally to be found on the side best protected

during its passage.

on October 4th, 1860, Director Haidinger gave an account of this meteorite.

   The fall took place vvithout detonation, and only a slight noise was heard

similar to the rattling of carriages, on June 7th, 1855, 7| p.m., near the town

of St. Denis-Westrera, 2\ miles from Ghent.

It fell thirty paces from a man and woman, penetrated the ground about

2 feet, and was immediately dug up; it was hot, of a bluish-black colour, and

smelled sulphurous. It weighed 700'5 grammes, its sp.gr.=3*293. Its form
was similar to that of an " ananchites," having a flat elongated base and an

arched enclosure. It has the character of a real fragment, and is encrusted

all over. The crust is uneven on one side, wliilst the other is more even and

equally rounded, the edges between the rough surface and rounded planes

being well marked.

   The stone resembles those of Reichenbach's second family, " somewhat

--bluish stones." The stone contains disseminated iron and pyrrhotine, the

latter, sometimes filling up vein-fissures, giving it the character of a fragment

--from a very large mass a mountain of rock. Disseminated through the

whole mass were spots of iron-rust and crystalline globules, which leave im-

--pressions when falling out of the brittle mass.
   4. Indian meteorites. At the meetings of the Imperial Academy of
Vienna, on June 8th, November 3rd, and the last one in the year 1860, M.

Haidinger gives accounts of the Calcutta meteorites which had been acquired

a short time previously by the Imperial Cabinet of Minerals.

   (1.) The meteorite of Shalka fell in a rice-field about 80 yards south of the
village, on November 30th, 1850, a iev/ hours before sunrise ; it w^as witnessed

by two persons. The nqise, compared with thunder, was not very loud; the

stone penetrated 4 feet into the earth ; fragments were found 3 feet deep in a

circle of 20 feet radius. Only one stone fell, which may have been 3 feet long.

It came from the south, at an angle of about 80°. The stone is very peculiar ;

the white  portions  resemble  pumice,  whilst the darker resemble pearlstone
                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

it is friable like cocolite. The real fracture shows greasy lustre. It does

not contain any metallic iron. It belongs to Reichenbach's first family,

first group.

  A(2.) fall of meteorites occurred on December27th, 1857, at Quenggouk

in Pegu ; three stones, evidently fragments, were found five and ten miles

apart. It had the appearance of a large umbrella in flames, as observed

at a place ninety miles south of Quenggouk, at an altitude of 40° or 50°,

giving a report like that of a monster gun. Another observation, taken

on board the ' Semiramis,' about 200 miles S.E. of where it fell, describes it as

having had at first the appearance of a large star increasing to three times

the size of the moon, leaving behind a long tail, and falling towards the east.

Haidinger gives the height at 80 or 120 miles.

   (3.) This fall occurred at Dhurmsala in the Punjab, accompanied by a tre-
mendous noise, the earth being shaken in convulsions. The direction was

N.N.W.to S.S.E. The fragments penetrated to a depth of 1 to I5 feet; the

largest weighed 320 lbs. The fall took place July 14th, 1861.

(4.) The fall of meteorites at Futtehpore on November 30th, 1822, is men-

tioned.

(5.) The real locality of a stone which was found in 1846, and which

Piddington supposes to be from Assam, is not known. It is beautifully

marbled, very solid, and resembles the meteorites of Seres, Barbotan, and

others of the third family of Reichenbach. The crust is dark greyish-black,

=sp. gr. at 17° R. 3-792.

   (6.) The fall of the Segowolee meteorites took place on March 6th, 1853.
All the stones were pyramidal, and weighed from | to 4 lbs. The crust is
very thin, not over | line in thickness, dark-reddish brown. The whole con-

dition gives proof of a slight fusibility.

 --No. 5. The meteoric ironfrom Tula, Russia. In the year 1846, a mass of

iron of over 15 puds (542 lbs.) was found 4^ miles from Marunskoje. Dr.
Auerbach has given us the first notice of it. The princi)3al mass consists of iron

with pieces of meteoric stones imbedded. They are real fragments separated
from larger masses by mechanical force. The metallic nickeliferous iron
formed veins in the granular rock, the latter consisting of a mixture of me-
tallic iron and a silicate of iron and magnesia. The VVidmanstaiten's figures
in this iron show a striking resemblance to those of Burlington, Ovvego

County, New York.

   Judging from analogies observed upon our earth, Haidinger has come to

the conclusion that before the stones were imbedded in iron they were united
as portions of real rocks in one and the same celestial body, from which they

came to our earth.
   The forms of the larger and smaller lumps show, however, many peculia-

rities which require a more thorough investigation.
    The meteoric iron from Nebraska was obtained from N. Holmes, Esq.,

of St. Louis. The original mass weighed 35 lbs., and was found 25 miles

Awest of Fort Pierre.  segment of the Vienna specimen cut parallel with a

octahedral plane showed stride of half a line in width, intersecting at angles

of 60° and 120°, with the triangular and rhombic intervals between the en-

closing ledges of schreibersite covering the whole etched surface. The
Widmanstatten's figures show a close resemblance to those of the Red River

iron preserved in the Yale College cabinet.

   Fall of the Meteor of Parnallee, near Madura, in Hindostan. By
W. Haidinger, Ordinary Member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences.

(Presented at the sitting of February 7th, 1861.)

   A communication from Professor Silliman causes me to report on the fall

of a meteor which occurred on February 28th, 1857, about noon, near the

village of Parnallee, south of Madura, at the northern extremity of Hindostan.

Mr. Silliman wrote to me that the meteorite (which is deposited at Western

Reserve College, at Hudson, Ohio) had, according to the chemical analysis

made by Dr. Cassels, of Choktaws, Ohio, been found to contain only 3 per

cent, of metallic iron, and amongst it 17 per cent, of nickel. He expects to

receive a fragment of it, and they also intend to send us a portion of the lat-

ter- Now I was enabled, in answer to the above, to communicate several

statements which had not been known to Mr. Silliman.

Already in the summer of 1858, 1 read the excellent account drawn up by

the head of the American Mission at Madura, Mr. H. S. Taylor, respecting

--the fall of the meteor itself, two stones of immense size having fallen, one

weighing 37 lbs. and the other weighing four times as much, or 148 lbs.

This account is given in the ' Transactions of the Geographical Society of

Bombay ' for 1857; also the 'Athenaeum ' [probably the Madras 'Athenaeum']
contained a notice of it. Only in 1859, when our operations commenced

for the increase of the collection of the meteorites of the Imperial Mineral

Cabinet, I wrote to Dr. G. Buist, secretary of the Society and editor of the

Bombay Times. But Buist was just in the act of removing to Allahabad,

and could not intercede in the matter; so then I applied to Mr. Taylor

himself, and I also wrote to Madras. It now became evident that the larger
stone was being sent to the Museum of Madras, but that the one weighing

37 lbs. which he received back again, had been sent to Hudson in America.
Mr.Taylorwas kind enough to give me the address of ProfessorCh. A. Young,

to whom I then wrote directly, and who already a fortnight ago had the

kindness to promise us a beautiful specimen of this meteorite of Parnallee,

                                                                         d2

which I shall in due course place before the students and fellow-mem-

bers of my class. I could even have delayed my present communication

respecting the fall itself until then, as no accounts of it are to be found in

any European book.

xlccording to Mr. H. S. Taylor's account, the two stones fell a little north-

east of the village of Parnallee, 9° 14' N. and 78° 21' east of Greenwich, ac-

cording to the map of the Government Survey. According to the direction

of the hole which they made in striking the ground, they came from about

N. 10° W. inclining to the perpendicular at an angle of from 15° to 20°, the

smaller one nearly perpendicular. They were fixed in the ground in such

a manner that that part of the surface which was the most rounded or convex

was placed towards the bottom ; this was, as Mr. Taylor expressly states,

in accordance with the centre of gravity, and therefore the very position which

the meteorites had to take in passing through the resisting atmosphere. The

larger stone struck into the ground in a ploughed field to the depth of 2

feet 5 inches, the smaller one to the depth of 2 feet 8 inches ; the smaller

one had not the appearance as if it Were a fragment of the larger one ; the

specific weight of the smaller one is, according to Taylor, 3'3. The larger

stone when grown moist showed on the round surface a crack, which after-

wards became still wider, pei'haps in consequence of oxidation : the report

caused by its fall was considered terrible by the natives, like two thunder-

claps as one stone struck into the ground after the other; and the echo lasted

for some time, although that was not so loud. They were heard as far as

Tuticorin, to the south, on the coast of the Gulf of Manaar, at a distance of

forty English miles ; very loud at Madura, which is sixteen miles off.

Several persons were near the spot when the fall took place, and yet nobody

saw either of these large bodies as they fell, owing, as they think, to the velo-

Acity of the motion.  cloud of dust rose from the places where they struck

the ground ; Mr. Taylor could still see the hollow which had been caused in

the compressed earth. Up to the 21st of April, when he examined the

locality and obtained the stones, there had been no fall of rain.

Their shape, although somewhat irregular, is compared to large cannon-balls

covered with a black crust as if smoked, in the interior like granite, with

particles of iron. Taking into account the short time during which the phe-

nomenon lasted, the fact of the stones striking into the ground without any

one having seen them approaching in the atmosphere, all this might tend to
show that the ground was struck by a real " horizontal shot."

   M. Haidinger,of Vienna, recommends as convenient in certain cases that the

observed apparent tracks or paths

of meteors should be approximately

mapped down, on the principle of a

Mercator's chart, and that the alti-

tude and geographic orientation ^''°l ' ^t^                   '           '  '^"^

should be carefully inscribed in a

diagram like the annexed figure, in    30° "~

No. 6. Extracts from a letter from Professor Cocchi, at Florence, to

Mr. Greg.

"At 9 o'clock P.M., 25th July, 1847, when I was riding from Prato to

Florence with a relation of mine and a man-servant, an enormous igneous

body appeared over our heads, rushing towards the north. Our horses were

heard no detonations after the disappearance of the meteor, which was many

times larger than the moon, but a kind of hissing sound, not unlike the flying

of some bird. I think it must have passed very near us ; at least, we expe-

rienced a sense of heat at the time, and when its light was extinguished we

could for some seconds distinguish in the air a phosphorescent light.

   "On the 4th or 5th of October, 1859, I was walking with my two

brothers near our country seat of Tarrarossa, at about 8 p.m., when suddenly

our attention was attracted by a splendid fire-ball flying rapidly in a S.W.

direction ; the apparition lasted some seconds, when it disappeared beneath the

horizon. I heard no detonation, but my brothers stated they heard it in spite

of the great distance ; if so, the fragments of this meteoric body fell down

into the sea, not manv miles from Tarrarossa.

  " My friend Professor Compani, of Siena, wrote to me some time ago about

a similar event which terrified and dismayed Siena, and made many of its

Hecitizens leave their shaking houses in a great hurry.  says, ' In December

last (1860), about the 16th day of the month, an enormous bolide traversed

the sky over Siena, which a few minutes afterwards made a terrible noise in

its progress ; it left in its track many sparks. Judging by the ear, the explo-

sion must have taken place between Asciano and Buonconvento ; some indeed

aver having seen fall, in some places, sparks of fire ; nothing, however, was

found."

" Florence, August 8th, 1861."

   --No. 7. Extract from Dr. Buchner's Work on Fire Meteors.

   " It has been contended by many, in opposition to Chladni's (1820) opinion,
that large fire-balls are totally different from shooting-stars, that they are
quite a different class of bodies. Davy, L. Smith, and Shepard, who are the

advocates of this opinion, among other things insist upon this point, that

if both are analogous bodies there would also, at the time of the periods
for shooting-stars, especially in the months of August and November, neces-
sarily fall more aerolites. They contend that no instance of any observation
made could be stated, that whenever an aerolite has been seen, it equally made
its appearance by itself alone, and not in connection with other meteors.

   " Even though the rich November streams of 1779, 1830, and other years
have not actually been shown to have been abundant as regards meteorites,
yet the recent modern comparisons made are such as may cause us to fairly
admit the homogeneous nature of the two phenomena. Baumhauer compared
the fire-meteors for the single days in the year, as also has Rudolph Wolf at
Zurich. Accordingly, leaving out the days on which no tire-meteors or a few
only were observed, we have the following days as having been particularly
plentiful as regards large fire-balls and falls of meteor-stones.

   The time when most meteors are seen would probably also be the time
when we should observe them most nearly moving at right angles to their

true directions.

   B. Olmsted, in his ' Mechanism of the Heavens,' a popular little hand-book,

concave path in the sky ; and similarly a body falling through 3 3 would appear to describe

the larger arc 3' 3', &e. Hence those meteors which fall nearer the axis of vision would

describe shorter arcs, and move slower, while those further from the axis and nearer the

horizon would seem to describe larger arcs, and move with greater velocity. The meteors

would all seem to radiate from a common centre 1', which was the case on Nov. 13th, 1833.

why there should appear to be a radiant point for shooting-stars, and why near
that point in the heavens no meteors or very few were seen, or if seen why

their tracks near that point appeared so short, and in other parts longer (and

why perhaps also, on the principle of fig. 1, more numerous towards the east).
40 REPORT 1861.

   C. May it not be presumed that the majority of meteors seen at night must

be coming towards the sun, their average distance from us while visible
being not more than 50 or 100 miles : while the earth, being 7000 miles in
diam^eter, would consequently intervene as a shield in keeping out of sight
the majority of meteors coming directly from the sun, and whose paths we
come across ? If two meteoric stones struciv opposite sides of the earth at the
same moment, 12 m., we might almost presume one was going to, and one
from, the sun. It would certainly be interesting to know whether the ma-
jority of meteors are going to or from the sun, or passing the earth's path

at right angles, obliquely or parallel.

   mD, It is quite possible that two shooting-stars, and m' (fig. 8) might each

appear to project on the sky apparently a similar and common track Z' Z",

though in reality moving nearly at right angles to each other's direction, the
only difference being a shorter or longer visible path. The angle might even
in some cases perhaps be more than 90°, and the two meteors coming
obliquely and from opposite directions ; yet an observer at o would be unable
to tell in which direction the meteor moved ; in either case it would seem to
pass downwards in the ordinary way. This helps to show the difficulties in
these cases, and to negative results in catalogued descriptions giving the
directions meteors have appeared to move.

   E. Why is it that meteors are so seldom seen near the horizon even on a

clear night ? Is it because of the atmosphere, or that they would necessarily
in that position be too far off? If they do not come nearer the earth's sur-
face than 40 miles without being consumed or extinguished (fig. 4), we should

                                                                   Fig. 4.

and as thatpossiblj" (say 1,50 miles) is above the average limit of visibility, we
perceive perhaps why we do not often see shooting-stars very low down in the

horizon. It might be desirable as frequently as possible to record the length
of the visible arcs described by shooting-stars, and the time in moving along
these arcs, to see if the average varies at difi'erent hours of the night, for dif-

ferent quarters of the heavens, as well as at different times of the year.

   F. In making averages from tabulated statements, say for a whole year, in
reference to meteors, the enovmous preponderance of meteors seen on a few
days only, viz. August 9-12 and November 10-13, which, being periodic
and generally moving in parallel right lines and in one direction, must have
a tendency to disturb to some extent any attempt to fairly tabulate the more
scattered observations during the rest of the year.

    However, Olmsted's account of the great meteor-shower in 1833 seems

to prove that there were then hardly any known meteoric appearances

(whether as regards tracks, luminosity, size, direction, velocity, &c.) which
were seen on that night that one is not accustomed to see or read of at
all other times put together. Most, too, were seen in the east, and moving
from thence towards the north-west; so that we might not unreasonably infer

that most shooting-stars at all times much resemble each other.

  --G. Humboldt describes a shower in Mexico, on the night of the 12th of

November, 1799, thus : " They rose from the horizon between the east and
north-east points, described arcs of unequal magnitude, and fell towards the
south." They were seen in many other parts of North and South America
on the same night, and in Labrador they were observed to fall down towards

the earth.

At Rome, the observations of Secchi gave a decisive maximum on the 10th
of August. The observations of Bradley at Chicago, and of Herrick at New

Haven, Connecticut, U. S., gave the increase of shooting-stars on the nights

of the 9th and 10th of August, 1860, at about six times the common average,

and their apparent direction nearly all from the vicinity of the constellation

Perseus.

At Yale College, Connecticut, U. S., 565 falling stars wereseenon the night

of the 9th of August and morning of the 10th, between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m.,

the sky, with a westerly direction ; several left behind luminous trains, but
none appeared to explode : none seemed larger than Venus ; three-fourths

teen meteors, of which nine were conformable and five not conformable.

 14th, the average per hour was only 24*4. M. Coulvier-Gravier's calcula-

--tions show that the year 1858 marked the term of the decrease of the number

 of these phenomena since 1848 the epoch of their greatest number. Since
 1858 their number has gradually risen ; and we may hope therefore for the
 reappearance of the meteoric splendours of August.

     Further observations on these brilliant phenomena, by Father Secchi, at

 Rome, appear in the Cosmos. On August 9th, forty shooting-stars were seen

 between 9 and 10 o'clock p.m.; on August 10th, between 9 and lOj, 133
 appeared ; and in the same period of time on August llth, the number fell
 to seventj'. Secchi therefore concludes that these phenomena are not

 meteorological, but cosmical. He adds that he considers the most rational

 explanation to be the admission that the sun is surrounded, in addition to
 the comets and planets, by a ring formed of small bodies, which cuts the
 ecliptic at the point where the earth is situated on August 10th ; and as every
 year the earth returns to this point on the same day, and as, also, this point

 may correspond with a condensed portion of the ring, we therefore see a
great number of these small bodies, attracted by the mass of the earth, fall
 into it, and become inflamed by contact with our atmosphere. This theory

he considers to be confirmed by the constancy of their directions, which are
parallel and contrary to that of the earth in its orbit on that day." Extract

    Note. In generalizing from observations on the August periodical meteors
at any one spot on the earth's surface, it should be remembered that the
hourly numbers seen vary considerably with the locality. In 1833, the
great and wonderful display of meteors on November 13th was almost en-
tirely confined to the area of the United States ; and the total numbers per
hour observed of late years simultaneously at different stations appear to

vary. Secchi's theory of the ring of meteors is pretty much that which

Sir John Herschel advanced some time ago, and seems to be well worthy
of acceptance ; their orbits must in all probability be more elliptic than

that of the earth's orbit.

                                              August Meteors.

  --"Sir, The August meteors this year have been more numerous than usual.

Last year, both at the August and November epochs, the sky was completely
overcast ; so that it was impossible to determine their number, or, in short, to
make any observations at all. During the August epoch of the present year
(1861), although there was much cloud at times, there were periods of clear
sky which enabled me to make some good observations.

    " Several letters in the Times have given a Persei as the point of diver-
gence of the August meteors ; this is not correct, as the point is very near
t) Persei : a line drawn from jj Persei to a Cassiopeiae will pass through this

point at a distance of less than 2° from tj Persei. The meteors increased in
number as the night progressed, i.e. there were more about 2 a.m. than at

10 P.M.

    " The nearer the meteors were to rj Persei, the shorter were their paths ;
those with long paths were mostly 45° or more from this point. Those near
Perseus were longer in moving over 1° of space than those at a distance from

this point.
A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS. 43

" The meteors about Perseus were mostly small, some only just distinguish-

able, the larger ones were usually 40° to 60° from r; Persei.

  " A meteor, almost upon the point of divergence, scarcely moved amongst

the stars. The year before last I saw one exactly on this point ; it became

visible, increased in magnitude, and then disappeared without moving.

   " No meteor was observed to move towards r\ Persei, all moving away from

that star. On the 14th there were a number of meteors discordant, but on

the 11th and 12th scarcely one whose path produced backwards would not

have touched the point near tj Persei.

" There was a great similarity in the meteors. Nearly all had tails or streaks

which lingered for a short time after the meteors themselves had vanished,

and nearly all were of the 2nd to 4th magnitude.

  "A meteor seen through a telescope of 2| inches aperture, with a power of

20, had a decidedly planetary appearance, the tail hemg phosphorescent-looking,

not fire-like. The duration was too brief to make any very careful observa-

tions ; and the meteor itself was small, viz. 3rd magnitude.

   " The weather on the above days was warm, and the wind between W. and

S.W.

--No. 10. M. Le Verrier has just applied the results of his researches on the

four planets, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars, to the rectification ofexisting

astronomical tables. From the perturbations observed in the orbits of these
planets, he has come to the conclusion that there exists in our system a con-

siderable quantity of matter which has not hitherto been taken into account.

In thefirst place, he supposes that there must exist within the orbit of Mercury,

ataboutO"17 of the earth's distance from the sun, amass of matter nearly equal
in weight to Mercury. As this mass of matter would probably have been

observed before this, either in transit over the sun's disc or during total

eclipses of the sun, if it existed as one large planet, M. Le Verrier supposes

that it exists as a series of asteroids. Secondly, M. Le Verrier sees reason

to believe that there must be a mass of matter, equal to about one-tenth of

the mass of the earth, revolving round the sun at very nearly the same dis-

tance as the earth. This also he supposes to be split up into an immense

number of asteroids*. Thirdly, M. Le Verrier's researches have led him to

the conclusion that the groups of asteroids which revolve between Mars and

Jupiter, and sixty of which have been seen, and named, and had their ele-

ments determined, must have an aggregate mass equal to one-third of that of

Hethe earth.  thinks it not at all unlikely that similar groups of asteroids

exist between Jupiter and Saturn, between Saturn and Herschel's planet, and

between the latter and Neptune.

   Haidinger reports that M. Julius Schmidt, of the Royal Observatory,
Athens, is continuing his observations, it is said, on the phenomena pre-

sented by the luminous trains of meteors, with interesting results. It is in-
tended to publish some particulars in the next year's report on luminous

meteors.

   The following recent publications on meteoric literature may be especially

Report on the Action of Prison Diet and Discipline on the Bodily

   Functions of Prisoners -Vstxt I. By Edward Smith, M.D., LL.B.,

   F.R.S., Assistant Physician to the Hospitalfor Consumption, Bromp-

   ton; and W. R. Milner, M.R.C.S., Surgeon to the Convict Prison,

    Wakefield. With Appendices.

The Committee appointed at the late Meeting of the British Association,

" to prosecute inquiries as to the effect of prison diet and discipline on the
bodily functions of prisoners" have the honour to state that they have ful-
filled the task assigned to them so far as time and opportunity have per-
mitted ; but they regret that, on the one hand, they have not been able to
gain access to some information which they required, and, on the other,
that the great extent of the inquiry has prevented the completion of the
series of researches, to which they attach great importance. Hence they
purpose on the present occasion to present the first part of their report,
which will include some general remarks on the management and present
system of dietary and punishments in county gaols, with the various re-
searches which they have hitherto made into the influence of prison disci-
pline over the weight of the prisoners, the precise influence of prison
punishments over the respiratory function and the elimination of urinary
products, with the ordinary discipline of the gaol and with certain forms of

labour.

    In conducting their researches the Committee have had in view not only
the letter but the spirit of the resolution by which they were appointed, and
have understood their prime duty to be the elimination of important physio-
logical facts, for which the discipline enforced in gaols offers good opportu-
nities. Whilst, therefore, determining the various matters which will be
discussed in this the first part of their report, they have also been very de-

--sirous to investigate some of the more recondite questions in nutrition as,

for example, the relation of the nitrogen ingested to that egested ; and having

obtained the valuable aid of Mr. Manning in making chemical analyses, they
have concluded two extended series of inquiries at Coldbath Fields and
Wakefield Gaol, in which the relations of the ingested and egested nitrogen

have been largely inquired into ; but the great care required in this part of
the inquiry, and the very extended character of the subject, have induced the
Committee to withhold the results hitherto obtained until another occasion,
when, should they be permitted to do so, they will present them with addi-
tional inquiries in the second part of their report.

    With these explanatory observations, the Committee proceed to state the
results of their inquiries, and, first, to offer some general remarks upon the
management, the dietary, and the punishments in county gaols.
ON PRISON DIET AND DISCIPLINE.  45

                     GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.

                     The Management of County Gaols.

   The management of county prisons is placed almost exclusively in the
hands of the County Magistracy, and is therefore liable to as much diversity
as there are Boards of Visiting Justices. The Secretary of State must ap-
prove of any " rules" within the meaning of the Act, and he also approves
of the scale of dietary ; but hitherto he has not exercised his power to insist
upon uniformity in dietary ; and hence, within certain limits, the Visiting Jus-
tices regulate the dietary. There are also three* (nominally four) Inspectors

of Prisons for England, appointed by the Home Secretary, who visit the pri-
sons periodically, and report their condition to the Home Office, and also

suggest to the Visiting Justices from time to time such changes as they may

think to be desirable; but they have no power to interfere with the orders
of the Visiting Justices, if the orders are within the provisions of the law and
the " rules" of the prison. Hence the sole authority in county gaols under
normal conditions is the Board of Visiting Justices. There is a scheme of

dietary which was recommended by the Home Office, under the admini-

stration of Sir James Graham ; but it is not always adopted, and there is no

plan whereby uniformity is ensured.
    It thence follows that there is the greatest diversity in the gaols both as

to punishment and dietarj', and to a consideration of this your Committee

directed their first attention.

   A " Return of Dietary for Convicts, &c." was issued in 1857, which gives

the dietary in the various convict and county prisons, but there has not
been any general return obtained as to the nature of punishment inflicted,
and the plan pursued in carrying out hard-labour sentences. As it was
very desirable that some authorized information upon these points should be
introduced into tiiis report, Mr. Bazley, M.P., most readily and kindly un-
dertook to move for one in the form given in the Appendix (H.), but, alter
having it entered upon the "Orders for the day," he failed to obtain the sanc-
tion of the Government, and withdrew it. The Committee venture to hope

that the British Association may think this of sufficient importance to lend

their aid in obtaining it during the next Session of Parliament, and would
remark that, although the proposed return has a formidable appearance, its
tabulated character tends to reduce, and not to increase, the expense of print-
ing and the labour of writing.

                                            Punishments.

    In the absence of this authorized return, the Committee quote the results

of an inquiry previously made by Dr. Smith, who addressed a letter to the

governors of upwards of sixty county gaols, and was favoured with their re-
plies. The general expression of the results is as follows :

    " In our county prisons some find no labour at all, others only that of
ordinary trades, others have crank-labour f alone, others treadwheel-labour
alone, whilst in many one of the two, or both of the two latter forms of hard
labour are conjoined with some kind of trade. In many the treadwheel and
crank are unprofitably employed, whilst in others they are used as mills or

pumps. In some, women even work some kind of crank and the treadwheel.

 --* The number is now reduced to two. Feb. 1862.

   f When the term " crank " is employed in this report, it is intended to indicate the in-
strument turned by hand, and technically known as the " hard-labour crank." This differs

from other hand cranks only in that it is purposely arranged for non-remunerative work,
and indicates the number of revolutions which have been made in a given period.
--46 REPORT 1861.

In some the treadwheel and crank are exceptional emploj'ments; in others they

are universally used for a small part of the sentence ; whilst in a third class
they are the constant employments during the whole term of imprisonment.
In most gaols they are chiefly employed for short sentences, and therefore

for small crimes, and with insufficient food, whilst the light occupations are
reserved for long sentences, with greater crimes, or frequent repetition of
crime, and sufficient food. In some they are worked for an hour without
intermission ; in others thirty, twenty, fifteen, ten, and down to four minutes
only at a time. In some they are enforced for three hours daily, and simply
as exercise ; whilst in others the labour endures ten hours. In many, boys
of fourteen years of age work the wheel and the crank ; whilst in otiiers,

able grown men make shoes or pick oakum only. In some the ordinary rate

of the ascent on the treadwheel is fifty-six steps of 8 inches each per minute,
whilst in others it is so low as thirty. In some the ordinary pressure on the

--crank is seven pounds ; in others, twelve pounds, the pressure being certain,

and demonstrated by weights in one, and uncertain, depending upon the
turns of a screw in another. In some the ordinary number of revolutions

per day is 14,400; whilst in others, in which the crank is still the chief in-

strument of punishment, it varies from 13,500 to 7000 or 6000, at the discre-

tion of the surgeon, the prisoner being in all these instances without disease.

In some the day's work may be performed in any part of the twenty-four

hours, with the index of the instrument in sight of the prisoner; whilst in

Newothers, as the  Bailey, Salford, it  must  be  performed  before  the  night

and with the index outside the cell, so that the prisoner is unable to ascer-

tain, from time to time, how much labour he has yet to perform. In some,
pumping is employed for an hour only, and even during that short period,

as at Reading, there is no method of determining if any individual prisoner
is labouring or not; whilst in others, the labour is for the whole day, pump-

ing water into the sewers.

   "Oakum-picking is no labour in one prison, and hard labour in another;
and in the latter it is two pounds for a day's work at Wandsworth, and three
pounds at the Coldbath Fields, whilst it is five pounds at a workhouse ; and
the rope itself difiFers greatly in the amount of labour which is required to

tear it to pieces. In some the prisoner, by good conduct, obtains lighter

labour, a commendatory badge, and a pecuniary reward ; in others it is tread-
wheel labour from the beginning to the end of the imprisonment, whilst in

many, as at Wandsworth, the change of labour is due neither to crime, sen-
tence, nor conduct, but simply to the variation in the number of the pri-

soners.

   " In addition to all this, in some prisons the separate system is strictly

enforced and a mask worn, whilst in others hundreds of prisoners sit together
in the room picking oakum ; and, finally, in some the cat is so heavy, and
the officer's arm so strong and willing, that the prisoner is for a time made

insensible to pain after a few strokes, whilst in other prisons it is so light as

to leave very little evidence of its use."

   Hence it appears that the utmost diversity exists in the different county
prisons as to the instruments of punishment employed, the condition in which
they are kept, the amount of labour which they exact, the amount of a day's
work, the system ol' progressive change in the use of the various means of

enforcing labour, and, in fact, in all that concerns the carrying out of the

sentences of hard labour.

                            Dietary.

   In reference to dietary, the diversity is even more striking ; for so various
are the schemes contained in the " Return of Dietaries for Convicts, &c.,"
                     ON PRISON DIET AND DISCIPLINE.                                          47

referred to, that it is impossible, by any method, to give an analysis of the

amount of nutriment which they supply. An abstract of the most notice-

able parts of the return is given in the Appendix (I.) ; and it is proposed

to state in this place only a few general facts.

It is customary to provide several scales of dietary, increasing in the nutri-

ment supplied according to the duration of the imprisonment; so that with

the shortest sentences, as three, seven, or fourteen days, the only food given

is bread and gruel*; whilst for prisoners condemned to long terms of impri-

sonment the diet is generally an abundant one of meat, vegetables, bread, and
gruel. The terms of sentence to which these several classes apply vary in

the different gaols ; but usually a sentence of four months carries with it the

highest scale of dietary. In nearly all gaols the prisoner is on entrance
placed upon his proper scale of dietary ; but in the Kendal, Carlisle, and

other prisons he begins with the lowest scale, and gradually ascends as his
duration of imprisonment continues.

It is also usual to vary the dietary from day to day; so that there is a con-

siderable daily variation, not only in the kind and quantity of food, but in
the amount of nutriment supplied. There is commonly an increased dietary
given to those who are condemned to hard labour ; but the modes in which

sentences of hard labour are carried out differ so much, that this is practically
valueless. There are gaols in which the treadwheel is worked for short

periods with a dietary of bread and gruel only*. But in none is there any
attempt to estimate in a scientific manner the amount of increase of nutri-
ment which is proportioned to the increased labour. Usually there are three
meals a day allowed (at St. Albans there were only two) ; and of these the
first and last consist commonly of bread and gruel. The amount of flesh

supplied in the highest scale of dietary varies greatly, as, for example, from
6 ozs. of cooked meat without bone in the Middlesex and Brecon Prisons,
and 7J ozs. of uncooked meat with bone at Wakefield, to (until very recently)
an entire absence of that food in the Cardiff Gaol. Very small quantities of

milk, cocoa, oatmeal, cheese, and tea are given in a few gaols ; but com-

monly the dietary consists of meat, soup, potatoes, bread, and gruel in various

proportions, and with various systems of alternation.

The surgeon has power to add to the dietary if he should see fit ; and such

additions are commonly bread or milk. Bread and water are rarely given

as an ordinary dietary*, except for "prison offences;" and for these the pri-

soners may be condemned to the dark cell and bread-and-water dietary for

a period not exceeding three days at one time. If the prisoners have been

condemned to hard labour, this most severe punishment may be extended to

one month ; but after three days he is fed on bread and gruel. Flogging is

resorted to in various prisons as a part of the sentence upon prison offences,

if the prisoner have been convicted of felony ; and a return in reference to it

has recently been issued. The gaols in which the largest number of prisoners

were flogged for prison offences were those which had the most non-remu-

nerative punishments; and in this respect the gaols at Manchester and Liver-

pool offer a striking contrast. In military prisons it is understood that the

punishments are still more severe, since they are inflicted under the Mutiny

Act                  and it is very desirable  that  authorized returns should  be           obtained
                  ;

from them.

   The foregoing general observations may suffice to show that he who at-

tempts to ascertain the effect of the present system of prison punishments
and dietary undertakes an inquiry of the widest kind, and, with the diversity

                     * In the Gloucester Gaol bread and water are still given as a dietary.
48 REPORT 1861.

of system which exists, he will need to present nearly as many reports as

there are gaols to be reported upon.

                        SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES.

   The Committee now proceed to consider the effect of prison discipline

over the bodily functions of the prisoners, and will include in their report

the result of the inquiries made by them into the variation of the weight of

the prisoners, the excretion of nitrogen and carbon, the quantity of air in-
spired, and the rate of pulsation and respiration.

                                   Variation in Weight.

   The value of weight as an indication of the healthfulness and vigour of
the body is one of a very general character only, and, when applied to test
the effects of any agent over a number of men relatively to each other, is of
little worth until all the men have been brought into nearly the same bodily
condition. The weight of the body is due to many circumstances of very

different values, as, for example, to the contained food and excretions, the
amount of fluid in the circulation and in the tissues, the deposited fat, and
to the size of the bones, quite apart from the nitrogenous elements to which
reference is essentially made when an estimation is attempted of the vigour

and healthfulness of men. Many of these elements can never be truthfully

estimated ; but in prison discipline it has been ascertained that some of them

--are removed during the earlier periods of imprisonment as, for example, fat

and superfluous fluid ; and, with the reduction in weight which follows, the
body gains a higher relative nitrogenous composition.

   When, therefore, the body has been so reduced in weight by the labour
and discipline enforced, the condition of the men may be compared with

greater truthfulness, and weight will be a fair index of the vigour and health-
fulness of the system. Hence, whilst investigations into the influence of
prison discipline over the weight of the prisoners must be regarded as of
great value, they must give place in importance to such as determine the
influence of the discipline over each separate function ol the organism.

   Much difference of opinion exists in gaols as to the value of the test of

weight, and in many it is so lightly esteemed that it is not applied at all. In
other gaols it is usual to weigh the prisoners on entrance and discharge ; and
in a few the weight is taken monthly ; but in none is it effected with such

rigorous exactitude as to fit the results for the use of the physiologist. It

is manifest that the weighings should be made before breakfast, and after
emitting the excretions, and also that the prisoner should be weighed naked,
or the clothes be weighed apart and the weight of them deducted carefully

on each occasion ; for otherwise the former will lead to an error of 2 lbs. in
either direction, and the latter to an error of a smaller amount, even if the
external clothing be the same on each occasion. This, however, is not at-
tended to in any gaol, but the prisoners are weighed at various hours, and a
standard weight is allowed for the clothes.

   Mr. Milner has investigated this subject during a period of more than ten
years, including several thousands of prisoners, and embracing the questions
of duration of imprisonment, employment, season, and others of a subordi-
nate importance; and to these the Committee will now refer. Appendix III.

   The diet on the convict side at the Wakefield House of Correction is
liberal and uniform, consisting of 20 ozs. of bread, 4 ozs. of cooked beef,
^ pint of soup, 1 lb. of potatoes, | pint of skimmed milk, and 2 ozs. of oat-
meal. The dress is sufficiently warm. The prisoners have running and

walking exercise during nine hours per weelv, and are all employed in some

nianul'acturing occupation, as mat- and matting-making, tailoring, or siioe-

niaking. There are not now any of the proper prison punishments, as tlio

crank and the treadwheel, used at that gaol. The cells offer a capacity of

900 cubic feet, and 35 cubic feet of air per minute for each prisoner, with a

mean monthly temperature varying from 56°'9 in March, to 66°'5 in August.

The average age of the 4000 prisoners under inquiry was 26^ years, of whom

25 per cent, were under 21 years, and were therefore still at the period of

growth.

--In reference to duration of imprisonment, Mr. Milner states as follows :--

" Duration of Lnprisonnient. I have divided the time of imprisonment

at Wakefield into periods of two months each, and have tabulated six of

these periods, so as to show the variation of tiie weight of the men during

the first twelve months of their stay. (Appendix IV.) I have not carried

the table any further, as very few prisoners remained longer than twelve

months, and those that were detained beyond that time were chiefly invalids,

and, consequently, cases from which no general inferences could be fairly

drawn.

   " The table shows the gains and losses in bi-monthly periods, and also the
proportion of prisonei-s who had to be placed on the extra diet list, who

were first placed on the list during each period. The number placed on

extra diet during the first twelve months of their stay, was 1393, out of which
number 3'14- per cent, were put on during the first two months, and 12'31

])er cent, during the second two months.

   " The stage of their imprisonment had evidently a very marked effect.
During the first two months the majority gained weight; in the second

bi-monthly period a large loss occurred, equal to nearly twice the amount

gained in the first period; in the third period there was still a loss, but not
to so great an amount ; the next three periods show a steadily increasing

gain.

" For a due understanding of these fluctuations, it is necessary to consider

the circumstances under which prisoners are received into this prison. They

are all brought from other prisons after having been tried and sentenced to

various periods of transportation, or penal servitude ; they have consequently
passed through the period of anxiety which elapses between committal and

trial, during which time, I have reason to think, men often fall off very much
in condition and health. When we receive them their fate is decided, and
they know the worst. In a large proportion of cases, I believe this is fol-
lowed by a feeling of relief and by a reaction of the mind against the de-

pression under which it had previously been suffering ; later on, the con-

tinued imprisonment begins to tell and it becomes necessary to give extra

Adiet to counteract its depressing tendency.  reference to the tables shows

tiiat it was tliought necessary to give extra diet to a large number of prisoners

during the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth months. Tlie number of pri-
soners who were placed on the extra diet list for the first time during these

four months, was nearly twenty-one per cent, of the prisoners in confinement,

and 60 per cent, of the whole number who were put on extra diet during

ihe twelvemonths.

   " The effect of this addition to the diet is shown by the gradual and pro-

gressive improvement during the last three bi-monthly pciiods, when the
amount gained, added to the gain of the first period, nearly restored the

equilibrium of tiie mass.

    " Prison Employment.-- In Appendix V. the employments of the prisoners
·are distributed into five groups, putting into each group the classes of work-
                                                                                 ;

--50 · REPORT 1861.

men who, as a class, were most nearly associated in the average amount

gained or lost during their stay ; and when arranged on this principle, it will be

found that the groups also represent very accurately the amount of muscular

force required to be expended in the respective kinds of work at which they

were employed.

" The first group consists of men employed in picking oakum, an occupa-

tion in which the labour is merely nominal ; and it will be seen that these

men gained nearly two pounds each on the average, and that a large per-

centage of them were gaining weight. The oakum-pickers are placed in a

group by themselves, as they consist principally of exceptional cases, a large

proportion of them being men who, from weakness or infirmity, were unfit for

real labour; many were, on medical grounds, employed in the garden, and

had extra allowances. The second groujj contains men working at sedentary

trades, as tailors and shoemakers, as well as a few employed in writing and

other light occupations. Of these men a large per-centage gained weight,

and the average gain was nearly a pound and three quarters per man. The

third group comprises carpenters, mechanics, and men employed in winding

the yarn into balls, or winding it on to bobbins for the mat-makers. The
men in this group generally work standing, and therefore a greater number

of muscles have to be brought into play. The weight of work, however, is

thrown on the arms, and the legs have little more to do than to support the

Abody in a convenient attitude. smaller per-centage of these gained weight,

and the average amount gained was less. The foiirth group contains the
men employed in weaving canvas, in making mats in the loom or on boards,

and also a small number (thirty-six) who were engaged in platting coir, or

in binding mats. The work of all these men is decidedly heavier than that

of the men forming the preceding groups, and the majority of these were found
to have lost tveight. The last group contains only one class of work, viz. the

weaving of coir matting ; but the effects of this were so very decided that

it was necessary to give it a place to itself.

   " The weaving of coir matting by hand is a very laborious occupation :

the yarn is coarse and rough, so that the friction between the thread of the

warp and weft is great, and to produce good firm work the weft has to be

heavily and repeatedly struck, in doing which the muscles of the arms and

trunk are brought into powerful action ; the legs have also to be employed
in working the treddles, and, in consequence of the power required to work

the loom, the M'eaver cannot work sitting.

" The effect of this greater expenditure of muscular force is very manifest

for nearly 80 per cent, of the men so employed lost weight during their stay,

and the average loss per man was nearly seven pounds.

   " The influence of the various employments would have been much more
marked if it had not been, in some degree, counteracted by the extra diet
given to those men who were falling off very much in weight; and the nuin-
bers to whom it was found necessary to give extra diet, in each class, also

bore a pretty close relation to the amount of muscular force expended.

Among the men employed in coir-picking, 26*8 per cent, had to be placed

on extra diet; in the second group 26-4 per cent.; iu the third 36-8 per

cent. ; in the fourth group 39-4' per cent. ; while of the matting-weavers

t50*l per cent, required additional food.

                           The Committee have not been immediately asso-
_

ciated with inquiries into the influence of the proper prison punishments

over the weight of the prisoners, such as the treadwheel, crank, and shot-drill

but their inquiries warrant them in stating that the normal action of these

punishments is to reduce the weight of the prisoners. In the absence of the
ON PRISON DIET AND DISCIPLINE.          51

'Return* above referred to, it will not be possible for the Committee to

discuss this influence satisfactorily.

   " The only returns in relerence to treadwheel labour which have been

obtained are given in the Appendix (VI.), and have been kindly furnished
by the governor of the Wakefield House of Correction ; but they comprehend
only a small number of prisoners, for the use of that instrument was discon-

tinued in consequence of the serious loss of weight which it occasioned.

   " The average loss of weight was 263 lbs. per man during the first week's

labour, 4'57 lbs. at the end of the second week, 6 lbs. at the end of the

third week, and 7"7 lbs. at the end of the fourth week. The progressive de-
clension in weight with duration of labour is very striking ; but it must not
be presumed that it would be continued indefinitely, since a point must be at

length reached vvhen the weight would be so reduced that it will remain

nearly stationary ; and the time required to arrive at that point will vary with
the fulness of the body, the tone of the tissues, the nature of the dietary, and

the severity of the labour. The greatest loss of weight always occurs in the

earlier weeks of imprisonment.

 --" Affe, Weight, and Season. On the subordinate questions of age,

weight, and the season of the year, Mr. Milner found that those prisoners

who were at the period of growth did not grow according to the scale ob-

served in others more favourably circumstanced, but lost weight in an in-

creasing ratio; so that, conversely, he found that the decrease in the virtual

loss of weight occurred as the age increased. The prisoners gained weight

from March or April to August or September, and lost in the winter months.

The loss of Aveight of the prisoners varied as the height ; so that the taller
men required an increased quantity of extra food. Appendix VII., VIII.,

and IX.

 --" Summary. On summing up the whole question it was found that, with

the arrangements of that prison, which were more favourable than the ave-

rage of prisons both in dietary and punishment, there was an average loss

on the whole weighings, although 3635 of 4000 men were under forty

years of age."

   From the foregoing tables and remarks it will appear that the weight of
prisoners is much below that of persons of the same age and height in a

state of freedom, and also that loss of weight during imprisonment is the

normal condition of prison discipline.                                            ,

This result doubtless depends partly upon the relation of food and exer-

tion, and partly upon the inability of the system to assimilate the ordinary

food of mankind with a rapidity sufficient to meet the wants induced by

constant and great labour. The Committee do not purpose on the present

occasion to consider the question of the exact amount of food required to
meet the wants of the prisoners ; but as in the foregoing remarks reference
has been frequently made to the necessity of giving extra diet in order to

avert loss of weight, it is deemed right to introduce two interesting facts

--which came under Mr. Milner's observation.
   Effect of Milk. The effect of milk in arresting loss of weight was most
striking, and in a degree far beyond that of the relation of its nutritive

elements to the waste of the system. Thus the addition upon his recom-

mendation of only \ pint of skimmed milk, containing not more than 7 grs.
of nitrogen, to the daily dietary, was followed by a reduction in the extra

diets from 22*55 per cent, in 1853 to 15'08 per cent, in the first nine months

after the additions in 1854, 15-27 in 1855, 14-08 per cent, in 1856, to 9-56

per cent, in 1857. As the extra diets represent the cases permanently losing

Weight, it is manifest that milk was the proper remedy to meet the loss, and

                                                                           e2
                                          --.

              .

that it acted not simply by supplying a small quantity of nitrogen to obviate
the waste of the nitrogenous tissues, but in an indirect manner by improving
the general nutrition of the system in the matter pointed out by Dr. Smith

--in the ' Phil. Trans.' of 1859.
   Effect of Tea. Tiie effect of tea in lessening weight was also largely in-
vestigated by Mr. Milner in 1857, both as an addition to the ordinary dietary,

and in substitution of the oatmeal contained in the gruel.
   Four divisions of the prison, each containing between forty and fifty

prisoners, were cliosen for observation and comparison.

   The divisions chosen were Nos. 2 and 3 in B and C wings.

   The prisoners in the division No. 2 were chiefly employed in mat-weaving,
and those in division No. 3 in mat-making.

   The prisoners in the 2nd division of B wing had a pint of tea given to

them in addition to the regular diet of the prison. The prisoners in the

3rd division of B wing had a pint of tea given to them in jjlace of the pint

of gruel served out for supper ; tiie prisoners in the 2nd and 3rd divisions

of C wing remained on the regular diet. All the prisoners in these four

divisions were weighed every week during the continuance of the observa-

tions. At the end of the period the result was thus :

                                                                                                                                                                     lb.

   Thus, so far as the results obtained from one set of prisoners may be

compared with those obtained from other sets, it must be admitted that these
experiments prove that the use of tea tended to lessen the weight of the
prisoners, and consequently to show that it is unsuited as an article for extra

diets.

              Respiration and Pulsation.

   The Committee now proceed to give the details of their inquiries into the
influence of tlic agents under consideration over some of the vital processes

of the body, and hrst those of the respiration and pulsation. Tiie inquiries
comprehend experiments as to the quantity of air inspired and of carbonic
acid expired, and the rate of the functions of respiration and pulsation. In
reference to the value of the quantity of respired air as a measure of vital
action, the Committee refer to the inquiries previously made by Dr. Smitli
and published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1859, wiiich liave
shown that, M'iiilst there is not an unvarying relation between the air inspired
and the carbonic acid expired in ordinary respiration, but that the ratio
increases with tiie severity of the exertion, there is sucii a correspondence

that the one may be used as a measure of tiie other in ordinary inquiries, and
especially tiiat the measure of the air inspired may be used as a measure of

the relative elfects of similar agents.

   The effects of the most laborious prison occupations, as the treadwheel,
crank, and shot drill, over the respiratory function and over pulsation have
ON PRISON DIET AND DISCIPLINE.  53

  been determined by Dr. Smith, by experiments made upon liimsclf in Cold-

  bath-fields, Wandsworth, the New Bailey Sallbrd, and Canterbury prisons.

   The experiments upon the quantity of air inspired were made by the aid of
   a spirometer, M'hich was a dry gas-meter with an inverted action and enlarged
  apertures, and was connected with the body by a mask which enclosed the
  nose, mouth and chin, and prevented ingress and egress of air, except
  through pre-arranged valvular openings. This was bound upon the head
  with straps. The spirometer was adapted to register from 1 to one million
  cubic inches. The inquiry in reference to the carbonic acid was made by

 --the aid of a double set of the apparatus elsewhere described*.
      With Treadwheel Labour. The effect of treadwheel labour varies in
  different prisons with the rapidity of the ascent, and other phenomena. Thus
  at the Coldbath-fjelds prison the amount of air inspired per minute during
  two minutes after having been upon the wheel five minutes, and again during
  two minutes after having been upon the wheel thirteen minutes, was, in
  various experiments, from five to six times the quantity expired at rest, viz.
  2900, 2605, 2350, 2350, 2435, 2460, and 2450 cubic inches, giving an
  average of 2500 cubic inches per minute.

     At the New Bailey, Salford, the average of experiments made upon two

  days gave only between three and four times the quantity at rest, viz., 1839

   cubic inches per minute.

      At the Canterbury gaol the amount was even less, and varied from 1607
  to 1820 cubic inches per minute ; but as the rate of ascent varied greatly at
  that treadwheel, it was impossible to obtain fair average results.

     The rate of respiration at Coldbath-fields was about double that at rest,

  viz., 27, 26|, 23, 23^, 24^, 25, and 26 per minute. At the New Bailey it was

  24 per minute; at Canterbury it was still less, and varied from 21-1 to 24 per
  minute. The depth of inspiration at Coldbath-fields was from 3 to 4 times
  that at rest, viz., 107^, 911, 94, loo, 99^, 98|^, and 94^ cubic inches. The
  rate of pulsation at Coldbath-fields was more than double of that at rest, viz.,

  150, 172, and 168 per minute; at the New Bailey 159, and at Canterbury
  140 to 158 per minute. That of the prisoners was at the New Bailey from

   125 to 155 per minute ; and at Canterbury, from 118 to 142 per minute.
      Such was the effect of the labour during the period of exertion ; but in

   order to determine the full influence it is necessary to refer to the intervening

  periods of rest also ; and in doing so it will be found that, during the whole

  period of rest allowed, the functions were never restored to their normal

   action.

      At Coldbath-fields, after thirteen minutes' rest, the quantity of air inspired
  was still nearly double of that at rest, viz., 980 and 815 cubic inches per

  minute ; and at the New Bailey, after four minutes' rest, it was 855 cubic

  inches. The rate of respiration at Coldbath-fields was reduced to an addi-

  tion of about 5, viz., 18 J, 15, and 16^ per itiinute, and at the New Bailey

   to 18 per minute.

      The depth of respiration was nearly one-half greater than during normal
   rest, viz., 53, 48, and 49 cubic inches at Coldbath-fields.

      The rate of pulsation at Coldbath-fields was one half more than the normal

. amount, 110,97, and 120 per minute, whilst at the New Bailey it was reduced

  to 109 per minute.

      These two sets of inquiries, when conjoined with the knowledge of
  the prescribed duration of each, enables us to compare the effect of these
  modes of punishment at the different gaols, notwithstanding the almost un-

accountable diversity which exists in the use of them ; and the result will
show, in a most striking manner, the great accuracj' with which experience
enables ordinary officials to regulate their system of punishment to the full

powers of endurance of the prisoners.
   It is customary at Coldbath-fields for the prisoners to work and rest

during fifteen minutes alternately; but at the New Bailey they are placed

upon the wheel during twelve minutes, and have only four minutes' rest

before the labour is renewed. Hence, the actual period of labour at Cold-

Newbath-fields is only 3| hours, but at the  Bailey it is six hours daily ; and

although the labour is lighter at the New Bailey than at Coldbath-fields the

total effect per day is the same in both prisons, as tl^e following estimate

proves :

   Thus, with the use of instruments differing so greatly in power over the
human system, the plan pursued in each gaol is so well adapted to the
usual powers of the body, that the difference in the effect is only equal to
about three minutes' actual labour upon the treadwheel at Coldbath-fields,

and four minutes' at that at the New Bailey. This result illustrates also the

accuracy of the method of inquiry thus adopted.
   The influence of this kind of labour over the production of carbonic acid

as well as over the rate of the functions, was established by another set of
experiments made in a similar manner at Coldbath-fields prison.

   The apparatus employed was that already mentioned, and was used without
inconvenience when placed upon a shelf over the wheel and at a suitable
distance from the person to be experimented upon. As tliere was neces-
sarily some adverse weight placed upon the expiration by the collection of
the carbonic acid, it Mas not thought advisable to measure the air inspired
also, lest the result should be vitiated by placing some impediment upon both
acts of respiration at a time when the deepest and most frequent inspirations
Mere demanded ; and hence that part of the inquiry M'as abandoned. The
ascent of the body upon the M'heel M-as 28*65 feet per minute, and the M'eight
to be lifted was 200 lbs., and hence the labour actually performed Mas
equal to lifting 575*558 tons through 1 foot per day. The duration of the

labour M'as a quarter of an hour at a time, and the carbonic acid M'as col-
lected during three minutes after having been upon the wheel five minutes,
and during two minutes after ten or after thirteen minutes. Thus the car-
bonic acid was collected during five of each fifteen minutes. The quantity
obtained per minute was between five and six times that expired in normal

rest, viz., 43*36 grains, 42*9 grains, and 48*66 grains on different days, the

latter quantity having been found soon after a good prison-dinner of soup.
The average excretion of carbonic acid under the influence of treadwheel-
labour was thus 45 grains per minute.

    The rate of respiration was 22, 21, and 20, aud that of pulsation 150 per

minute on each of the occasions referred to.
--;

ON PRISON DIET AND DISCIPLINE.  55

    The carbonic acid was also collected in the interval which followed the
 labour, viz., during three minutes after four minutes' rest, two minutes after

 ten minutes' rest, and two minutes after thirteen minutes' rest ; and, on the
 average of the whole, the rate of excretion was above that at rest, viz., 9" 14

grains per minute. The quantity of air inspired was also measured at the
same periods, and was somewhat less than that which occurred in the previous
experiments, viz., 680, 590 and 600 cubic inches, 560 and 540 cubic inches,
and 560 and 570 cubic inches per minute. The rate of respiration was 17, 16
and 15, and the rate of pulsation at the end of the 15 minutes' rest, was 102

per minute.

    Thus the results obtained from inquiries into the quantity of air inspired
and of carbonic acid expired during treadwheel-labour closely correspond,
and show that at Coklbath-fields the influence of that mode of punishment
is to increase the elimination of respiratory products from five to six

--times during the period of actual labour.
    With the Hard-labour Crank. The next series of experiments refer to the

influence of the crank as an instrument of punishment. This instrument is

simply a hand-mill which demands a certain expenditure of force to move
the handle, and is described as having a pressure of such a number of pounds
as may be requisite to depress the handle from the horizontal to the vertical
position. It is not used profitably, and is worked by each prisoner separately

in his cell. Experiments have been made at Wandsworth and the New Bailey

prisons in the manner already described.
   At Wandsworth the cranks are Appold's patent, and are of superior con-

struction. They move with a minimum pressure of 7 lbs., but the pressure
required to move them may be increased to 10 or 12 lbs. by a prepared set
of weights. The usual number of revolutions which the prisoner must
make per day of ten hours, is 13,500; but that number may be reduced at
the discretion of the Surgeon. The index is in sight of the prisoner, so that
he may ascertain the progress of his work.

   The experiments were made at several periods on two days with 7 lbs. and
12 lbs. pressure, and witli varying rates of speed. The rate which was the

most natural was forty revolutions per minute, but the prisoners generally

performed about thirty per minute. The efl'ect upon the system varied

much, both with the pressure and the speed ; but, excepting the rate of

pulsation, the very interesting fact was educed, that the total effect of the
days work in performing the required number of revolutions was nearly
the same, whether the rate teas 30 or 45 jwer minute. With 7 lbs. pressure
and 30 revolutions per minute, the quantity of air inspired was somewhat

less than double of that at rest, viz., 912|^ cubic inches per minute, with 17
respirations and 92 pulsations per minute. Witii the speed increased to
45*7 revolutions per minute, the quantities of air inspired were increased

to nearly three times that at rest, viz., 1336 cubic inches, with 21*5 re-
spirations and 113 pulsations per minute.

   With 12 lbs. pressure and 30 revolutions per minute, the quantity of air
inspired was between 2 and 3 times that at rest, viz., 1260 cubic inches

the rate of respiration 24'7, and the rate of pulsation 11 1*5, per minute.

Two experiments gave almost identically the same results, the only difference

being 3 pulsations, -4 respiration, and 3 cubic inches of air per minute.
With the speed increased to 44*7 revolutions per minute, the average of two

experiments gave 1898 cubic inches of air, or about 4 times that at rest,
with 24'7 respirations and 150 pulsations per minute.

   The efl'ect of speed in reference to the day's work of 13,500 revolutions
may be thus shown :
--56
REPORT 1861.  '

    1. With a pressure of 7 lbs. With 30 revolutions per minute 7 hours
33^ minutes will be employed in completing the task, and the total quantity
of air inspired will be 4'15,636 cubic inches ; but if the rate be 45*7 revolutions
per minute, the task may be completed in 4 hours 55*4 minutes, and the
total quantity of air inspired will be 345,654 cubic inches, giving a diffei-ence

of 7982 cubic inches, or only 6 minutes' labour at the greater speed in favour

of the increased speed.

   2. With a pressure of 12 lbs. With 30 revolutions per minute the total
quantity of air inspired will be 571,158 cubic inches, and with 44*7 revolu-

tions per minute it will be 573, 19G cubic inches per minute, quantities

which for all purposes may be regarded as identical.
   Hence the law is established that the effect upon the system of the whole

day's work varies little with the speed, provided there be a fixed number of

revolutions per day.

   The experiments in reference to the effect of the two pressures with tlie
same kind of crank, show that with the ordinary rate of revolution the in-
fluence of the 7 lbs. to the 12 lbs. is a little more than as 3 to 5, or in general
terms it may be affirmed that 3\ hours' labour with the 12 lbs. pressure is

equal to 5 hours with 7 lbs. pressure. When the rate was increased beyond

the ordinary one, the relative effect of the greater pressure was somewhat

higher.

   The cranks used at the New Bailey prison are much inferior to those

found at Wandsworth, and the pressure employed cannot be rigorously
determined. The medium amount of pressure was estimated at 7 lbs. ; and the

effect of this labour with a rate of revolution of 36*5, 39*5, and 40 per minute
was to cause the inspiration of nearly double of that of the 7 lbs. crank at
Wandsworth, viz., 1793 cubic inches of air per minute, with 21^ respirations

and 155 pulsations per minute. When the pressure was increased to the

one of nominally 9 lbs., the quantities were nearly 75 per cent, higher than
that of the 12 lbs. crank at Wandsworth, viz., 2105 cubic inches of air, with

23^ respirations per minute. Hence the effect was much greater at this
than at the Wandsworth prison, and the pressure, although nominally the

same, was fearfully different.

    Such is the effect of crank-labour, an effect which time for time is less

than that of the treadwheel ; but the experience in prisons proves that crank-
labour is not inferior in severity to that of the treadwheel, and, in the ob-

servation of many, has long been believed to exceed it. The inquiries now
recorded enable us to determine this question with exactitude, and to show
that, when the duration of the labour is taken into considci-ation, the effect of
the crank at the New Bailey is so great that the treadwheel may be used as

a relief from it.

   In comparing the effect of crank- and trcadwheel-Iabour, it has been shown
that the 12 lbs. crank at Wandsworth and the so-called 7 lbs. crank at the

New Bailey, are equal time for time to that of the treadwheel at the New
Bailey, but that the etrcct of the so-called 9 lbs. crank at the New Bailey is

nearly equal to that of tlie treadwheel at Coldbath-fields, when considered

time for time ; but as the time of actual daily labour with the crank is double
that of tjie actual labour on the treadwheel, the whole daily effect must be

so striking as double of that of the treadwheel. Can it be wondered at
that the punishment of the lash and of the dark cell for neglect of work is

frequent at the New Bailey, and in general in all prisons where the ordinary

--punishments are very severe ?

viation from more severe labour. The labour varies with the weight of the shot
to be carried, the weight of the body, and the rate of speed. The weight of the
shot is known and regulated, but varies in different prisons, whilst the speed
is dependent upon the will of the presiding officer. With a 16 lbs. shot at
Coldbath -fields, the average of three inquiries showed that the quantity of
air inspired amounted to nearly 4 times the amount at rest, viz., 1800 cubic
inches per minute ; and the rate of pulsation was 146 per minute ; but with
the 24 lbs. shot the quantities increased to 1850 cubic inches, and 154 pulsa-
tions per minute. The increase in the quantity of air inspired corresponded
with that observed by Dr. Smith when carrying various weights at the

" quick march," viz., an increase of 7 cubic inches for each lb. of weight.

Tlie 32 lbs. shot is commonly employed in military prisons, but no experi-
ments have been made with it. The chief sense of suffering in this labour
is found in the arms and back, from the frequent stooping and lifting which
are required, and therefore it is evident that persons of different height
and bulk will be influenced variously.

                                     Emission of Nitrogen.

    The next series of inquiries to which reference will be made, are those
which show the influence of prison discipline over the excretion of nitrogen,

and which constitute the most laborious and extended portion of these re-
searches. They consist of two sets, one of wiiich was prosecuted at Cold-
bath-fields under the iunnediate supervision of Dr. Smith, and the other at

Wakefield under that of Mr. Milner. The same series were also employed

to determine the relation of the ingested and egested nitrogen ; but this part
of the inquiry will, as has been already mentioned, be reserved for the second

part of this report.

                   Experiments at Coldbath-fields Prison*.

    In the first set of inquiries four prisoners in Coldbath-fields prison were

selected who had been some time in prison, and who worked the treadwheel

on three days in each week. Their ages varied from 22 to 43 years, their
lieight from 5 feet 2^ inches to .5 feet 7 inches, and their weight from
lOS'l lbs. to 122*6 lbs., and the averages were 32 years, 5 feet 4^ inches,
and 113"75lbs. They were spare but in good health, and their habits of

body were tolerably regular. By the kindness of the Visiting Justices and
the governor of the prison, Mr. Lambert, the third officer, took these men

under his immediate charge, and collected the urine, weighed the faeces,
weighed the food and the body, superintended the meals, the period of

exertion, and the whole general arrangements of the inquiry. The inquiry
occupied 26 days. The dietary was uniform, with the exceptions to be
presently mentioned, and consisted of 20 ozs. of brown bread, 1 pint of cocoa,
1 pint of gruel, 4^ ozs. of lean and 1| oz. of fat cooked meat, 8 ozs. of boiled
j)otatoes, 1 oz. (reduced to | oz.) of salt, and 30 ozs. of water ; and one of the
men had 6| ozs. of extra bread per day. The average quantity of solid food
was 34 oz., and of fluid 70 ozs., daily, besides the ingredients of the gruel

--and cocoa, and the extra bread of one of the prisoners. The exceptions

made in the dietary were as follows: No salt, except that in the cooked

food, was allowed during four days ; and 3g ozs. of extra fat, ^ oz. of tea,
1| oz. of coffee, and 2 ozs. of alcohol, were separately given through suc-

ceeding periods of three days each.

--S8 REPORT 1861.

. The discipline enforced consisted of treadvvheel-labour on three days
weekly, from 7^ a.m. to Sj p.m., comprehending a period of 3i hours of
actual labour, and an actual ascent of 1"432 mile, and was equal to lifting SSI-
tons through 1 foot daily. On the alternate days the labour was oakura-
picking, or similar light occupation, and on Sunday there was perfect rest.

    The urine was collected in bottles which were used also whilst passing

faeces. Two collections only were made on Sundays, viz., those of the day

and night, but on the weekdays the urine was also collected separately,
from 6.15 to 7.15 a.m.; and on the treadwheel-days from 7.15 to 8.25, a.m.
These two latter sets of quantities were termed " basal quantities," since by
one it was hoped to determine the actual rate of urinary excretion in the
absence of food, and by the other the influence of treadwheel labour apart

from any other influence. The analyses for urea and chloride of sodium
were made by Dr. Smith ; but those of the food and faeces, and the final
analyses of the urine were kindly made by Mr. Manning. The samples for
analysis were taken with the utmost care. The details of this investi-
gation are very numerous; and probably it may sufl[ice to give the follow-

--ing principal results of the inquiry.
    Urea, The proportion of urea to each lb. of body-weight, both on
days of labour and on those of rest, was much above that found in the

ordinary conditions of life, viz., from 4"39 grains to 4'7'i grains, or an

average of 4'58 grains to each lb. of body-weight. It Avas less than
4 grains to each lb. on only one occasion in each of the lighter, and
on three occasions in each of the two heavier men, whilst Dr. Smith

found in himself with about the same food, but with much greater weight
of body, an average proportion of only 2*75 grains to each lb. The cause

as well as the significance of this fact is not clear; for, as it occurs with rest
as well as labour, it can scarcely be an evidence of increased degradation of

tissue, and as the food allowed is not much beyond that which a man in

health would ordinarily eat, it cannot be, the I'esult of an undue ingestion of

nitrogenous food. The probable explanation is that already referred to, viz.,

that the nitrogenous tissues in the bodies of prisoners after a certain term of
imprisonment, bear a larger proportion to the weight of the whole body than
is found in health under ordinary conditions, since, by the labour and disci-

jjline of the jail, they have lost much of their fat and the fluid contained in
the tissues is reduced to a minimum quantity. The average weight of these
men was much below the ordinary weight of men of their age and height.

If this be the true explanation, the relation of urea to body-weight loses

much of its physiological importance.
   The urea excreted during treadwheel-labour before breakfast showed that

such exertion had no definite influence over the elimination of that product.

In one of the cases the excretion of urea was much greater than in the

others. There was some diversity in the quantities evolved by the others ; so
that in one they were the same in labour as at rest, in another there was an
excess of 2*5 grains per hour with rest, and in the 3rd there was an increase
of 1'9 grain per hour with labour ; but on the average, of all the three over
the whole period, there was '2 grain per hour less evolved with labour than
during rest ; and on the average of all the four prisoners, this defect was so
much as 2'4' grains per hour. There were numerous occasions on which
there was an excess with labour, viz. 28, 33, and 71 per cent, of the observation
in the three cases above separated. The greatest excess with labour was
7*5 grains, and the greatest defect with labour was 5*3 grains per hour, and
both occurred in the same person.

   As this inquiry occupied only 80 minutes at one time, it is very probable that.

the urea produced would not be eliminated within that period, and hence we

cannot take this as indisputable evidence of the effect of tread wheel -labour.

The variations above referred to were also, in part at least, due to the varia-

tion in the quantity of urinary water which was secreted during that period ;
and it is just possible that, notwithstanding every care, the bladder might not

have been completely emptied on each occasion.

The total daily excretion of urea was the least on the Sunday, greater on

the days of light labour, and the greatest on days of treadwheel-labour, on

which occasions the average quantities were 494<, 512, and 528 grains,

giving a daily increase on tread wheel-days of 16 grains over that of days of

light labour, and of 34 grains over that of perfect rest. There were some di-

.versities in the results, owing, apparently, to the fact that on two occasions

the elimination of the urea due to the treadwheel-days was in part deferred

until the next day, when there were remarkable meteorological disturbances,

and thus gave the appearance of greater elimination on the days of light or

of no labour. From this cause one of the cases gave an average de-

crease of 51 grains of urea on the days of treadwheel-labour, but in the

other three prisoners the increase with labour was 37, 59, and 21 grains

Hidaily. The largest increase on the treadwheel-days was                 grains, and the

--largest decrease 100 grains per day.
   Urinary Water. The quantity of urinary water evolved was, on the total

average, lO'-t per cent, greater on tread wheel than on other days, viz., 74'7

and 67"7 fl. ozs., and the same relation held good in each of the cases.

                                                            68-9             62-9

The quantity of fluid drank was the same on each day, and the amount

lost by perspiration was much greater on treadwheel-days than on other

days                     and  hence  the  blood and  tissues must have lost considerably more fluid
                      ;

--with great labour than occurs with rest.
   Chloride of Sodium. The evolution of chloride of sodium was very

great, owing to the large quantity taken with food, but was somewhat less

on treadwheel days than on other days, viz., 509 and 520 grains. When

the quantity of chloride of sodium taken with the food was diminished, the

same relation was still maintained, but in a less degree, viz., 432 and 437
grains, ^here was much variation in the results.

Hence, from all these inquiries, it follows that there is an increased

elimination of urea and urinary water with treadwheel-labour, but the

former is much less and the latter much more than we should have expected.

Neither of them are efficient measures of the true effect of exertion.

   FcBces.-- The determination of the daily evacuation of taeces was rendered

difficult from the habit of one of the prisoners to have an evacuation only on

alternate days, and the only method by which we could make an approxima-

tion to the daily evacuation was to divide the quantity on alternate days into
two equal parts, and reckon one part on the day on which no evacuation
occurred. The faeces were also placed under the date of the preceding day,

as they clearly were due to the conditions of that day. The following are

the principal facts educed :

1. The average weight of the faeces daily was double of that found in
                                                    --

--60 REPORT 1S61.

ordinary life, and varied on the average of tlie different prisoners, from V'l to
10*1 ozs., and gave so large a total average as 8*55 ozs. The extremes of
single observations were 1*75 and 26*59 ozs. The proportion to tiie solid
food was 22^ per cent.

   2. The weight was increased on Sunday by 44'"3, 70, and 74- per cent, of

that on all days.

   3. The weight was lessened on the treadwheel-days from that observed
on Sundays, by 41, 53*3, and 42*6 per cent, in three cases, and from the
average of all days by 14"8 and 21*1 in two cases, whilst in the 3rd case the

weight was equal on all days.

   4. The least evacuation occurred on the Saturday (which was also a
treadwheel-day), and the diminution from the weight of all days was 26"1,
57'6, and 34*6 per cent., and from that on Sundays no less than 48, 75, and
62 per cent.

   5. The proportion of water contained in the fajces was very uniform from
day to day, viz., 73"5 per cent., and varied only from 71*8 to 77*6 per cent,
on different days. It was above the average on Sundays and a little below

the average on treadwheel-days.

   6. The quantity of nitrogen in each oz. of fresh fteces varied from 4*36 to
4*9 grains, and was, on the average, 4*646 grains. The total daily quantity
thus evacuated, was, on the average, no less than 41*8 grains. There was a
considerable increase on the Sunday, and a marked decrease on the Saturday,
and it was below tlie average on treadwheel-days, and in both of these
respects it corresponded with the gross weight of the faeces. The actual
amounts under the three conditions were 59*9, 35*8, and 40*53 grains, giving
an increase of 43*3 per cent, and a decrease of 14*3 and 3 per cent. There
was a very interesting fact noticed in reference to the relation of nitrogen in
the urine and faeces on the Sunday, and which showed, proliably, that the
assimilation of food was lessened on a day of perfect rest following one of
hard labour, viz., that the increase which was observed in the nitrogen in
the faeces on the Sunday corresponded accurately with the decrease observed
in the urine on that day, viz., a decrease of 13 and 18 grains of urea in the

urine, and an increase of nitrogen, reckoned as urea, in the faeces, of 71*33

grains.

   7. The case which had the extra allowance of 6 1 ozs. of bread daily,
evacuated the largest amount of fasces, both on the total average and on

--Sundays, a fact of great significance in reference to the kind of food which
--should be selected for extra diets.

   Summary. Thus, on reconsidering the foregoing results obtained from
this large series of inquiries, the following general facts were cjicited :

   Tlie prisoners emitted much more urea and faeces than occurs in ordinary

life.

   On Sundays, with entire rest, the amount of urea was connnonly lessened,

but the nitrogen in the fteces was increased in the same degree. The whole
weight of the faeces was increased.

   With treadwheel-labour there was a small increase in the amount of urea
and of urine evolved, whilst there was a small decrease in the evolution of
chloride of sodium in the urine, in the weight of the faeces, and the nitrogen
and the fluid contained in the faeces.

   On Saturdays, with treadwheel-labour, the diminution in the weight and

nitrogenous matter of the faeces was considerable.

   With increase in the allowance of bread to a prisoner who was believed to

need extra diet, there was a considerable increase in the weight of the fceces
and loss of their nitrogen, and particularly with rest.

ON PRISON DIET AND DISCIPLINE.  61

 --Experiments with Fat, Tea, Coffee, and'Alcohol. The foregoing observations

will be again referred to at the end of tlie report, and will form a basis upon

which the Committee may offer some recommendations; and before closing

the analysis of this inquiry the Committee propose to state the results of
certain short experiments which were made upon the effect of fat, tea, coffee,
and alcohol when temporarily added to the dietary. It is not proposed
on this occasion to enter into detail, since the results obtained point to the

desirability of conducting similar inquiries through much longer periods.
   The issue of the inquiries was as follows ;

    1. During the period of the administration of S\ ozs. of extra fat daily, the
amounts of urea and ui'inary water excreted were 529 grains, and 69*1 7 ozs.
on the average of all the cases, showing that no noticeable change had been

produced.

   2. During the withdrawal of :^ of an ounce (328 grains) of chloride of
sodium daily, the quantity of that salt excreted by the ui'inc was reduced
from 506 to 184' grains daily, the difference being almost exactly the amount
which had been withheld. After the full supply was renewed, it was some

days before the whole again appeai'ed in the urine.

   3. The excretion of urea was lessened during the administration of the tea
to 402 grains on the second, and 508 grains on the third, which was a
treadwheel-day. The exact amount of the diminution cannot be determined,
since in the three preceding days two treadwheel-days were included, and
thus this basis of comparison was unduly elevated.

   The excretion of chloride of sodium was increased to 542 grains per day.
   The quantity of urinary water evolved remained unchanged.
   4. The urea, which had fallen during the action of tea, remained below the
average during the action of coffee (which was administered after the ex-

periments on tea), but it rose 42 grains daily, and at the end of the period
was scarcely below the quantity normally evolved. The quantity of chloride
of sodium evolved was 50 grains daily less than with the tea, viz., 494

grains.

   The quantity of urinary water was not changed.
   5. The urea was also lessened during the action of alcohol, to the extent
of 26 grains per day below the normal quantity ; but it was still H- grains
per day higher than the quantity to which it first fell with the tea. The
effect was much more evident with treadwheel-labour on the first day ; for,
instead of an increase with labour, there was an elimination of 43 grains less

than occurred on the previous day with rest, but on the third day the in-

crease with labour was 111 grains over that evolved on the Sunday. On

the first day the barometer fell greatly and tended to prevent the elimination
of urea. The greatest effect was upon the elimination of urinary water,
being a diminution of no less than 20 ounces per day on the average of the
three days ; and as there was an unusual thirst during the administration of
the alcohol (without, however, any additional fluid food being allowed), it is

ea-sy to see in how great a degree alcohol tends to temporarily fix fluid in the

tissues of the body, and in doing so to restrain the emission of urea. There
was also a large diminution in the excretion of chloride of sodium, but it cor-
responded precisely with the diminution in the urinary water. The quantity
evolved daily was 352 grains, or a diminution of 27*5 per cent.

    Hence the effect of tea, coffee, and alcohol in lessening the emission of
urea appeared to be temporary only, and in the case of alcohol was associated

 with retention of fluid in the body, and consequently with an increase of
weight. The information thus obtained renders it important to test the in-

fluence of each article over a much longer period.

        Experiments at the Wakefield Prison. Appendix X.

    Ill June 1861 another series of inquiries were prosecuted in Wakefield Goal
of a character similar to those just related. Mr. Milner took charge of all
 the observations which were made within the prison ; Dr. Smith made the
analyses for urea and chloride of sodium ; and Mr. Manning kindly deter-

nn'iied the dry matter and the nitrogen in the food, faeces, and urine.

   Four men of regular habits and in good state of health were selected.
Two were weavers of cocoa matting, which is a very laborious occupation,

find two were tailors. Their ages were 19, 22, 24', and 28 years; tlieir height
was 64f, 66, 66f, and 67 inches, and their weight was 118 lbs. 11 02s.,
125 lbs. 12i ozs., J46 lbs. 11-3 q^s., and 146 lbs. 15| ozs. The girth around
the nipples was 32|- inches, 841 in., 35f in., and 35| in., giving an average
of nearly 34| inches. The total averages of age, height, weight, and girth
were 23^ years, 66*1 inches, 134 lbs. 8f ozs., and 34^ inches.

   They had been fed on the highest class of prison dietary ; but as that con-
sisted of some variety of food, it was deemed advisable to give them a uni-
form daily diet during one week before the experiments began, and it was

continued without intermission until the inquiry terminated.

   The food supplied daily was in part fixed, and in other part variable in
quantity. The fixed quantities were those of meat, oatmeal, and potato,

and the variable ones those of bread, salt, and water. Milk was given in a
fixed quantity, but the amount supplied was not uniform in both classes of

prisoners.

   The meat consisted of 5 ozs. of lean and 1 oz. of fat cooked beef, without
bone. The supply of oatmeal was 2 ozs., and 16 ozs. of cooked potato; 20 ozs.
of skimmed milk were given to the tailors, and 25 ozs. to the weavers. The
daily quantity of bread eaten was on the average SO'4 ozs. by the tailors,

and 34'3 ozs. by the weavers, or a general total of 27 35 ozs. 136*5 grs. of
chloride of sodium were eaten (besides that contained in the bread) by the
tailors, and 63"5 grs. by the weavers, giving an average of 100 grs. ; but

there was some considerable variation from day to day. One of the tailors

ate an average quantity of 199"3 grs. ; whilst the other tailor ate only 73'8 grs.

   The quantity of water which was drunk, besides that contained in 1 pint
of gruel, was only 23'8 ozs. on the average, giving with the milk a total sup-
ply of fluid of 66'3 ozs. The weavers drank much more than the tailors,
and the total daily quantities in the two classes was 80*5 ozs. and 52*1 ozs.
The solid food was 51"8 ozs., and the fluid 66*3 ozs., or a total of 118 ounces

daily.

The men arose at 6 a.m., and having passed urine and faeces were imme-

diately weighed. The scales employed were good ones, and the weight was

taken to 5th of an ounce. The prisoners were weighed naked. The weight

of the faeces and urine was ascertained daily, by the aid of balances kindly

lent by Messrs. Avery, of Birmingham, up to 6 1 a.m.; and the degree of con-

sistence of the faeces was recorded under five heads, viz. scybalous, well-

Aformed, formed but soon subsiding, soft, and liquid.  fair sample of the

bread, oatmeal, potato, meat, and milk was sent up to Mr. Manning from

Atime to time as changes in the supply occurred.  portion of the mixed

quantities of faeces and the urine of each set of prisoners was most carefully

taken and sent for analysis daily ; but delay sometimes occurred in the trans-

mission, so that the analyses were usually made on the third day after the

evacuation. The greatest care was taken to avoid loss by evaporation and

otherwise, and to prevent decomposition. The observations included thirteen

days besides the week of preliminary dietary, and the following are the

principal results which have been obtained :
49-1
64 REPORT 1861.

was 3*37 grs. per oz. in the tailors, and 3"18 grs. per oz. in the weavers, giving
a daily emission of ISS'S^l- grs. in tlie former, and 148*5 grs. in tiie latter.

  --Faces. The general character of the faeces was homogeneous and mode-

ratelj' cohesive, but on a few occasions there was a variety in the consistence.
In the 52 observations 32 exhibited faeces formed but soon subsiding, 7
well formed, 1 scybalous, 2 soft, and 9 of mixed character, and no one per-
son offered any marked difference in these characters. The bran of the brown

bread was easily seen in the faeces. The average daily evacuation was

6'98 ozs. in the tailors, and 8'52 ozs. in the weavers, giving a total daily aver-
age of 7*75 ozs. There were somewhat considerable daily variations, so that

the maximum and minimum quantities were, in the tailors regarded separ-

ately, 11*41 ozs. and 4*32 ozs., and in the weavers 14*42 ozs. and 1*72 oz.,
but in no instance was there the omission of a daily evacuation.

   The quantity of nitrogen per cent, found by Mr. Manning by the volu-
metric method varied from*71 gr. to 1*16 gr. in the tailors, and fi'om '97 gr.

to 1"35 gr. in the weavers; but the total average in the two classes was '93
in the tailors, and 1*12 in the weavers, giving 1*025 gr. in the whole.

   The total daily elimination of nitrogen by the faeces was found to be
27*43 grs. in the tailors, and 40*93 grs. in the weavers. The variation in the
amount of faeces on Sunday from that of other days was not uniform, since

it was less in the weavers and was equal in the tailors.

   It will have been observed that there were many differences in the results

obtained from the prisoners occupied in the two kinds of labour ; and as one
of the objects had in view was to show these differences, the two trades were
selected which, in that prison, offered the greatest dissimilarity in the amount

of exertion required.

   Of these two sets of prisoners, the weavers of cocoa matting, when com-
pared with the tailors, were older, taller, heavier, and broader; they ate
more bread, milk, and water. They lost weight, whilst the tailors gained
weight. They emitted more urine, urea, chloride of sodium, and faeces with
their contained nitrogen ; they exhibited much less diminution of urea on

the Sunday, and a little less urea to body-weight.
   It is not possible to compare the results of this inquiry very closely with

those already described at Coldbath-fields, since in the latter inquiry the
quantity of bread and water was rigidly fixed, whilst in the former there

were daily variations. The quantity of bread taken was greater at Wakefield
than at Coldbath-fields, and would so far increase the amount of urea pro-
duced, whilst the variable quantity of Avater taken from day to day would
vary the elimination of that product. Yet these causes of variation are not
of great value, and upon the whole it will be seen that there is a very close

correspondence between the products of the weavers at Wakefield and those

who worked the treadwhecl at Coldbath-fields.
   The weight of the men at Wakefield was more than that at Coldbath-fields,

the quantity of urine and of fluid drank was less, and that of urea was greater,
but the proportion of urea to body-weight was very nearly the same. In both
there was more urea with labour, and less on Sunday. There was less chlo-
ride of sodium in the urine as there was less supplied in the food. The weight

--of the faeces and the contained nitrogen were the same in both places.
    Conclusion. The Committee cannot close this first part of their report

without offering a few remarks in the nature of deductions or suggestions,
but, inasmuch as the duty confided to them is limited to a consideration of
the influence of prison discipline over the bodily functions of the prisoners,
and the present is only a part of their report, they feel that they cannot
express their views at any length.
                                                                               ;

       ON PRISON DIET AND DISCIPLINE.                                 65

   The Committee venture to think that the time is approaching when the
·whole subject of prison discipline must be reconsidered, and when a deter-
mination may be arrived at as to the propriety oC continuing a system which

when practised occasions vast waste of the vital powers of the prisoners,

and vast expenditure of money to provide a dietary which, although scarcely

sufficient, is far beyond that provided for the poor in workhouses, and beyond
that obtained by the working classes in general. The different systems

adopted in prisons are furnishing some evidence as to the relative value of

--three plans, viz., 1st, waste of animal force by the treadwheel and the crank

2nd, the use of manufacturing operations ; and 3rd, the effect of simple de-

tention and instruction without labour; and these, when conjoined with the
intelligent efforts put forth in the sister island, may almost suffice to guide

those to whom its consideration may be intrusted.

It is, however, certain that if much bodily labour be enforced, whether in

a profitable or unprofitable manner, there must be an expensive dietary to

supply the reparative material ; and no plan can be so wasteful as that which

enforces profitless labour, and supplies an expensive diet to meet its demands.

The Committee also think that some steps should be taken to ensure uni-

formity in prison discipline throughout the kingdom ; so that not only should

great care be exercised (as at present) to apportion the sentence to the

crime, but also that wherever the sentence is pronounced the carrying-out

of it shall be also proportioned to the crime. This may be effected in the
dietary, and yet allow such a variety of food as may be found relatively

economical in different parts of the kingdom; for the nutritive value of various

kinds of food is now tolerably known, and the quantity of each to give the

same nutriment may be estimated. So also in reference to punishments. It

is quite possible that the instruments should be of uniform construction,

that by supervision they should be kept in uniform order, that the speed at

which they are worked should be uniform, and the amount of a day's work

should be universally the same, subject only to the opinion of the Surgeon as

Ato the fitness of any individual to perform the required task.  committee

of scientific men would find no difficulty in placing all this upon a satisfac-

tory basis, if they were only authorized by the Government to do so.

It is also easy to estimate the amount of labour required in ordinary ma-

nufactures, at least so far to keep within the bodily powers of the prisoners

for we have the advantage of common experience as to the effect of such

labour in ordinary life. But the Committee are of opinion that, when all

the above-mentioned care shall have been taken, the effect of the proper

prison punishments, as the treadwheel, crank, and shot-drill, upon the pri-

soners will still be very unequal, since it varies greatly with such natural

conditions as the height, weight, age, and previous occupation of the person.

Hence these punishments must be at all times objectionable.
   The Committee defer until another occasion their recommendations in

reference to the exact adaptation of labour to supply of food ; but they take

this opportunity of stating that, as it involves the fundamental question of the

propriety of making the dietary an instrument of punishment, it will be

necessary in limine to decide the latter question. When Sir James Graham

appointed the Commissioners to draw up the present scheme of dietary, he

expressly directed that the dietary should not be used as an instrument of

punishment; but the Committee venture to affirm that the food supplied in

the lowest scale is so totally unequal to the wants of the system, that it can

only be regarded as an instrument of punishment ; and that it is so regarded

both by criminals and magistrates may be inferred from the dislike which

1861.                                                            F

old offenders have to short imprisonment with its low dietary, and from the
value which magistrates attach to this their most formidable agent.

    Without expressing a strong opinion upon this point, the Committee ven-
ture to assert that a dietary of bread and water, or Jaread and gruel, cannot be
enforced without doing serious injury to the prisoner's health ; and that this is

fundamentally recognized may be inferred from the fact that all agree that
a high scale of dietary is absolutely demanded in long imprisonments. The

Committee assert that the injury is one of degree, and that the shortness of
the imprisonment prevents the ill effects being observed, which with a long
imprisonment have been proved to increase the mortality in gaols.

   The Committee hope that, on philanthropic grounds, the principle may be

established in prison discipline, that the prisoner shall not be so treated that

when he leaves the gaol he shall be less able to earn his living than he was
M'hen he entered it, and that, punishment and reformation being sought toge-
ther, some plan may be adopted which shall accord with that principle.

   The fundamental fact of the duty of apportioning food to the labour per-
formed needs to be re-established. At present the attempt is nugatory ; but
the Committee venture to hope that the principle will meet with universal
concurrence, and that their labours afford at least some of the means whereby
the estimation may be made.

    The great value of the system of extra dietary cannot be too highly esti-
mated ; but the very admission implies that there is a defective adaptation of
the general scheme of dietary to the wants of the system, and that almost the

 life of the prisoner is, throughout a large part of the imprisonment, at the
discretion or negligence of one officer, viz. the Surgeon.

    The Committee also venture to affirm that bread is far inferior to milk as
an article of extra diet, as the experiments detailed in this report prove. The
detention in prisons certainly lessens the power of assimilating food ; and
hence it is quite possible that whilst a given quantity of food would sustain
a man out of gaol, it would not sustain him with the same labour in gaol.
The object of extra diet is not so much to give additional material, as to
give the iiind of food which will aid the system in making a better use of
that ordinarily supplied. Extra diet of bread (when the dietary is the
highest scale) is in great part wasted, and increases disproportionately the
amount of waste passing off by the bowel.

    In conclusion, the Committee urge the great importance of making better
use than heretofore of the unparalleled opportunities which prisons afford
of working out the most important and difficult questions in nutrition, with
a view to supply information for the more just and economical manage-
ment of gaols, and for the advance of a science which is so essentially con-
 nected with the daily life of the community. Such questions are, the true
value of white bread over brown bread in prison and other dietary ; the exact
 influence of various kind of food, and especially of such as tea, coffee, milk
and alcohol, which act chiefly by modifying the action of other food ; the
exact relation of a given quantity of food to a given amount of labour; the
causes of the defective power of assimilation of food in prisons, and the relation
of the elements of the food taken to those which are fixed in and thrown out
of the body. The Committee feel that the importance of such inquiries is
not by any means so well understood as it should be, and that some officials

have a natural repugnance to anything which may interfere with their ordi-

 nary routine ; but they trust that the expression of the opinion of this great
 Association, and the additional knowledge which they and others have en-

deavoured to discover, may open prisons to such inquiries.

   The Committee will cheerfully undertake to lend their aid in further

elucidating these matters, if it should be the pleasure of the Association to
reappoint them ; but they very respectfully represent the urgent necessity
which exists for the appointment, by the authority of Government, of one or
more Commissioners to reconsider the subject of dietaries, and to recom-

mend plans whereby uniformity in the nature and action of the instruments
used in prison punishments may be effected throughout the kingdom.

                                APPENDIX I.

On the Inequalities in the Dietary of County Prisons ; being an Analysis of

           the "Return of Dietaries for Co7ivicts" S)C., issued in 1857*.

Forty-three only of eighty-seven county prisons have adopted the scheme

of dietary recommended by the Government ; and in reference to the forty-

four prisons which dissent from that scheme, it will be evident, from the fol-

lowing statement, that much of the inequalities in their various dietaries is
attributable to the defects of the Government scheme, much to mere caprice,

something to very defective knowledge as to the requirements of the human

system, and something more to the absence of a desire to avoid injury to the

Weprisoner.     shall first give in a few words the dietary of the Government

scheme, and then describe the dietaries of all the prisons which have striking

peculiarities.

There are five classes of dietaries recommended by the Government, ac-

cording to the duration of the sentence, and such that the quantity and

quality of food are increased from the beginning of the imprisonment as the

duration of the sentence is increased.

   Up to twenty-one days, only bread and gruel are given, but under seven

days the bread (1 lb.) is given at dinner only, whilst over that period twenty-

four ounces are distributed over the three meals. Under seven days, females
receive as much bread for dinner as the males ; but over that period they

receive but half the quantity.

From twenty-one to forty-two days with hard labour, and to four months

without hard labour, three ounces of cooked meat with bread and potatoes

are given for dinner twice per week, one pint of soup (containing the same

quantity of meat) with bread twice, and simply bread and potatoes thrice
per week.

   From forty-two days to four months with hard labour, and beyond four

months without labour, three ounces of meat is given daily in soup or other-

wise.

   Beyond four months with hard labour, the quantity of meat is increased

--four times per week to four ounces, and an increase of half a pound of pota-

toes is added, soup, potatoes, and bread being supplied on the other days.
Sweetened cocoa for breakfast is also given thrice per week.

   The erroneous principles upon which this scheme is founded are, the ap-

portionment of food according to duration of sentence, the insufficiency for
short sentences and for hard labour, and the variation from day to day ; but

   * It is probable that some changes have been made in the dietaries of some of the County
Gaols, and particularly in those marked with an asterisk (*), since the return of 1857 was
issued, and since the following analysis was made ; but of this there is no authorized inform,
ttion. The analysis will, at least, show the state of the dietaries when the return was issued,

                                                                           f2

having already pointed them out in a paper published in the Transactions of
the Society for the Promotion of Social Science, we shall not pursue that sub-
ject on this occasion, but at once proceed to consider the dietaries opposed
to this scheme.

    The Welsh gaols, as a whole, have a reduced scale of dietary ; but one of

them, viz. the Cardiff Gaol*, is the most remarkable in the deficiency ; whilst
another, the Brecon Gaol, is nearly equally remarkable for its plenty. It is

instructive to notice how widely the schemes differ under different adminis-
trations, whilst the condition of the inhabitants of the localities must be much

the same. In the Cardiff Gaol there are four classes of prisoners, the highest
including all those condemned for periods exceeding fourteen days, a terra
scarcely equal to the second class of the government dietary, and even in
that no meat or other animal food in any form is given. For breakfast and
supper there is half a pound of bread and two ounces of oatmeal made into
 gruel, whilst at dinner there is only half a pound of bread and one pound of
potatoes. But if the prisoner should be condemned to hard labour he will
receive one pint and a half of soup, made from two ounces of Scotch barley
and two ounces of rice, and it is the same whether he is condemned to hard
labour for fifteen days or fifteen months ! If the prisoner is condemned for
 more than seven and less than fourteen days, he receives for dinner half a
 pound of bread only. If not exceeding three days or seven days, the break-
 fast and supper consist of half a pound of bread only, whilst the dinner is
 composed of half a pound of bread, and in the latter case of one pound of
 potatoes in addition. Thus, if he be confined for three days or for fourteen
 days, half a pound of bread only is sufficient for the dinner; but, if it be for
 seven days, he is supposed to need one pound of potatoes in addition ! This
 is the worst dietary in the whole of the county gaols , but the dietary of the
 Derby Gaol* shows that Englishmen as well as Welshmen are sometimes fed
 with the almost entire absence of animal food. The Derby dietary is divided

 into three classes ; but we are not favoured with the grounds of this division.

 In the first class there are six ounces of bread and one pint of porridge for
 breakfast, whilst in the second and third classes the quantities are increased
to eight ounces and one pint and a half. The word porridge docs not imply

that excellent article which we remember to have enjoyed in boyhood, but it

 consists of a quarter of a pint of milk and three-quarters of a pint of water,
 and one ounce and a half of oatmeal, instead of two ounces ordered by the

 Government to each pint of gruel. The supper consists of four ounces of
 bread and one pint of gruel (we are not informed as to the ingredients of the

 gruel) for the first class, six ounces of bread and one pint of porridge for the
 second, and eight ounces of bread and one pint of porridge for the third.

 The dinner in the first class is ten ounces of bread only; in the second class
there are eight ounces of bread and one pound of potatoes five times per
week, and eight ounces of bread and one pint of soup twice per week (the

 excellence of the soup is not stated); in the third class eight ounces of bread
 and two pounds of potatoes I twelve ounces of bread and one pint of soup

 thrice, and twelve ounces of bread and four ounces of meat once per week. The
 points of greatest interest are the excessive amount of farinaceous food, and

 the great defect of animal food. There is also a note appended to this return,
 stating that cases do sometimes occur of prisoners losing weight I If in the

 Wakefield Prison, to which we shall refer presently, a very large number of
the prisoners lose weight under the best management, and with a much better
  etary, it is not wonderful that at Derby they should lose weight sometimes^

We should be glad to know if they are weighed accurately and periodically
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

if they enter the prison having an average weight ; what percentage in each
                                                                              ;

class lose weight during their imprisonment ; and what is the tone of their
muscular system on discharge? The note also states that when they lose

weight the surgeon orders them to have extra milk, or bread, or meat. But

essential articles of diet should not be left to the chance of the negligence or

indiscretion of even the best of men.

The Brecon Gaol offers a contrast to both of the foregoing. Thus, for

periods exceeding fourteen days, the prisoner receives six ounces of meat

with eight ounces of bread on four days in the week, and also half a pound

of potatoes if under, and one pound of potatoes if ovei', two months. On the

other days the dietary is only bi'ead and potatoes. For breakfast and supper

the dietary for all periods is eight ounces of bread and one pint of gruel, but

on alternate days the oatmeal is boiled in the meat liquor. There is also a

further advantage given in substituting for potatoes, when they are bad, four

ounces of rice and one ounce of treacle or sugar. The Middlesex prisons

also give six ounces of meat at one meal. In the Coldbath-fields Prison,

and the House of Correction, Westminster, twenty ounces of bread are equally

divided between the three meals. There is also a pint of cocoa to the highest

class (exceeding two months) and one pint of gruel to others', for breakfast

whilst at supper there is one pint of gruel to the highest class, and half a

pint to others. The dinner, besides bread, contains, in the highest class, six

ounces of meat and eight ounces of potatoes four times per week, or one pint

and a half of soup thrice per week. In the second class (two weeks to two

months) there is the same quantity of meat and potatoes twice, one pint of

soup twice, and one pint of gruel thrice per week. But in the lowest class

it consists of bread and gruel only.

The Lincoln House of Correction at Spalding has also a dietary better

than that recommended by the Government, since, in addition to the meat,

there is allowed one pint of soup ; but the ingredients of the soup are not

stated. It has also the advantage of giving meat daily in the fourth and fifth

class, apart from the soup, and thus the important article of diet is evenly

distributed ; and since the soup is probably made from the meat liquor, it

increases the quantity of fat which is supplied to the prisoners.

The Newgate Prison, Lincoln Castle, and the Pembroke Gaol are re-

markable in having but one scale of dietary each for all the prisoners, thus

avoiding the fallacy which results from varying the dietary according to the

term of imprisonment. They, however, differ very much in the quantity and

quality of food which they deem to be proper for their prisoners. Thus the

Newgate Prison and Lincoln Castle adopt Class 4' of the Government scheme.

The Pembroke Gaol affords only one quart of oatmeal gruel (the quantity of
oatmeal is not stated) and three-quarters of a pound of breajl for dinner. At

breakfast there is a luxury found only at this gaol, viz. tea and butter; so that

the meal consists of a pint and a half of tea, one pound of bread, and one
ounce of butter. The supper is composed of one quart of milk pottage (the

constituents are not given) and three quarters of a pound of bread. This is

a remarkable dietary, and one which on paper must be very satisfactory,

Aexcept in the absence of animal food.       foot-note states that " the surgeon

orders extra food when necessary;" but the nature of the food which he may

order is not stated. The largest quantity of bread is contained in this dietary,

Weviz. two pounds and a half of bread daily.  should like to know the

result of the entire avoidance of fresh vegetables, a circumstance also pecu-

liar to this prison, if the return be true.

Another peculiarity is met with in the three Gloucester gaols (one of

which, the House of Correction at Horsley, is under the direction of a name
--'70 REPORT 1861.

 well known in prison management), viz. the exhibition of the same food on
each day of tlie week. The plan of varying the food with the class is pur-

 sued, but, with the exception of the third class, the food is not varied from
 day to day. In the lowest class the food is simply eight ounces of bread at
 each meal. In the second class one pint of gruel is added to the breakfast
 and supper. In the third class eight ounces of potatoes are added daily, and
 three ounces of meat twice in the week. In the fourth and fifth classes the
 meat is given daily, and in the fifth clciss the potatoes are increased to one
 pound. There is also another point worthy of notice which is peculiar to
 these gaols and the Lincoln House of Correction, Spalding, viz. the admi-
nistration of meat on every day in the week to the two highest classes, apart
 trom or to the exclusion of soup. There are thus two important circum-

stances redounding greatly to the credit of those who have the supervision

 of these institutions in the county of Gloucester.

    The peculiarity of administering the same food on each day of the week
 is also met with at the Cardiff, Flint, Sussex, and Wilts gaols. The poverty
 of the Cardiff dietary has already been stated, and the Flint Prison dietary
is very far removed from liberality. Thus for fourteen days it affords simply
one pound of bread and four ounces and a half of oatmeal daily. For six
weeks, one pound and a quarter of bread, four ounces and a half of oatmeal,
and half a pint of milk daily, and for all periods beyond six weeks a quarter
of a pound of bread is added daily, and two pints of soup per week.

    The Sussex Prison at Lewes gives to all classes half a pound of bread and
one pint of gruel for breakfast and supper. For fourteen days the dinner is
eight ounces of bread only ; for six weeks one pint of soup is added on three
 days per week ; for four months the soup is given daily ; and for all periods
beyond, one pound of potatoes is added daily. The dietary at Petworth is
 more liberal. Thus, after one month the dinner consists of half a pound of
 bread, four ounces of meat, and one pint of soup ; and after three months,
 one pound of potatoes is added daily. The dinner at this prison is therefore
 very excellent after the expiration of the first month. The two county gaols
 in Wiltshire have the same dietary. All prisoners not sentenced to hard
 labour receive one pound and a half of bread and one pint of gruel daily, and

 after fourteen days have one pint of soup in addition. This is all the dietary
 with hard labour from fourteen to forty -two daj's: viz., to fourteen daysAvith
 hard labour the dietary is simply one pound and a half of bread and one pint
 of gruel daily ; from six weeks to three months one pint of soup is added

 daily from the commencement ; and when the term exceeds three months, one
 pound of potatoes is given daily after three months. This scheme is not

equal to the Gfvernment allowance.

    The dietary in the Lancaster House of Correction at Preston varies chiefly,
 but not exclusively, with age, viz. under set. thirteen, under set. seventeen,
 and over set. seventeen. In these, the breakfast and supper consists of four
 ounces of bread and one pint of gruel, six and two-thirds ounces of bread
 and one pint of gruel, and six and two-thirds ounces of bread and two pints

 of gruel respectively.

    The dinner of the first class is four ounces of bread and one pint of gruel

 thrice; four ounces of bread, four ounces of meat, and one pint of soup
 once; four ounces of meat and half a pound of potatoes once; four ounces
 of bread and one pint of soup once ; and the singular combination of half a
 pound of potatoes with one ounce of cheese once per week. In the second
 class the scheme is varied simply by the administration of six and two-thirds
 ounces of bread daily ; and the third differs from the second in doubling the
                                                                             ;

ON PRISON DIET AND DISCIPLINE.                    71

quaotity of potatoes, cheese, gruel, and soup. The soup, however, does not

contain meat, and the gruel is very poor.

Tliere are certain limitations, depending upon the duration of the sentence.

Thus, for seven days the diet is twelve to twenty ounces of bread daily. For

fourteen days boys and girls receive half of the second-class rations, and for

a month adults have half of the third-class rations. There is also a great

and unique curiosity in the list of limitations which refer to itch patients,

who receive but twelve ounces of bread per diem, whether as a punishment

Weor a cure for their uncleanness is not stated.  cannot but regard this as

a meagre dietary, since we cannot tell in what degree the discretionary power,

which a foot-note states to rest with the governor and surgeon, in increasing

the dietary after three months' imprisonment, is exercised, and, so far as

adults are concerned, it appears that the only increase which can be made

extends to ten ounces of bread only.

  A gaol which has for its governor another gentleman of the name of Shep-

herd, viz. the Wakefield Gaol, is also remarkable in its dietary, but in a dif-

ferent direction from any of the foregoing. The peculiarity is in the greater
variety of food and the care which is taken to make it palateable. The di-

stinction into classes is maintained, and in the highest classes is so extended

that it begins only after twelve months' imprisonment. The breakfast and

supper are alike, except in the highest class, and consist of one pint of gruel

only in the first class (seven days), whilst in the second and third six ounces

of bread are added ; in the fourth class eight ounces of bread are allowed,

and in the fifth class the same quantity of bread is allowed, and milk substi-
tuted for gruel for breakfast, but not for supper. The dinner in the first

class is one pound of bread. In the second class it consists of half a pound

of bread and one pound of potatoes twice, four ounces of bread, with one

pint of pea-soup or a pint and a half of gruel twice, plain pudding and one

ounce of treacle twice, and twelve ounces of bread alone once per week. In

the third class the bread and potatoes alone is restricted to once per week

four ounces of bread, one pound of potatoes, and three ounces of cooked

meat are given once ; four ounces of bread, a plain pudding, and one ounce

of treacle once ; whilst four ounces of bread and one pint of soup, pea-soup,

or Irish stew, are given four times per week. In the fourth class the bread,

meat, and potatoes are given twice (once being instead of bread and potatoes

alone), the other diets remaining the same. In the fifth class the bread,

meat, and potatoes are given thrice, the same with half a pint of soup added

twice, and bread and Irish stew alone twice per week. The soup does not

contain meat, but is made from meat liquor, oatmeal, and vegetables. The

pea-soup has the large quantity of six ounces of peas and four ounces of car-

rots per pint, with mint and pot-herbs. The Irish stew contains three or

four ounces of meat with sixteen ounces of vegetables. The plain pudding

is a quart made from eight ounces of flour. As the soup is partly made

from bones, which are boiled for twenty-four hours, it contains a very essen-

tial article in abundance, viz. fat. Altogether, this is not only the most

elaborate dietary in the return, but it seems to be the ultima TTiule in that

direction, and whatever may be its defects, it certainly evinces an anxious

desire not only to feed the prisoners suflSciently, but to treat them with the

consideration due to beings who have the sense of taste. Yet with this diet-

ary, and with the entire absence of the treadwheel and the crank labour, a

very large proportion of the prisoners are reported weekly as losing weight.

The Hertford Gaol at St. Albans * off'ers some peculiarities by which it

might have been ranged with the foregoing, but it has one which is quite
--Y2 REPORT 1861.

distinctive, viz. the absence of supper. The hours of meals are not given ;

but the fact is stated that onlj' breakfast and dinner are allowed, even to
those condemned to hard labour, both males and females. Surely this is
cruelty, and must result from gross ignorance of the wants of the system and

the responsibilities of those who devised and retain the plan. If there is no
excess of food left over from the previous day, in those prisons where a meal
is given at 6 p.m., upon what do the St. Albans prisoners sustain the exer-
tion of hard labour before the breakfast, when the previous meal was the
dinner on the previous day ? If sleeplessness results from both repletion
and want of food, we should like to know how deep is the repose of the
Hertfordshire felons. The unenviable refinement to which we have referred
is also further seen in the absence of division of the classes by time, so that
all the prisoners are fed alike during the first week of imprisonment, whether
they are sentenced to hard labour or not, and for whatever duration; and
 after the first week the dietary is the same, except that it is varied in refer-
 ence to labour, and further varied in reference to the sex condemned to hard
labour. Thus there is no increase in the dietary, and hence the nature of
that dietary is of vast importance. The breakfast uniformly consists of
twelve ounces of bread and a pint of gruel, except when associated with
 hard labour, when there are sixteen ounces of bread for the men. The

 dinner consists of twelve ounces of bread and one pint of soup (the ingre-
 dients are not stated) four times, and twelve ounces of bread alone thrice

per week. To females condemned to hard labour, the soup is given daily,

 and there is a further addition for males of four ounces of bread. There
 are thus one pound and a half or two pounds of bread given daily as in
 other schemes of dietary, but it is ill distributed, and whilst there are several
 points in the dietary to be commended, the absence of supper deserves con-

 demnation. As a contrast to this we may refer to the Welsh gaol at Car-

 narvon, in which supper is not only allowed, but it is enriched by the addi-
 tion of a pint to a pint and a half of broth ; but to this we shall again advert.

   We may now consider certain peculiarities in reference to the articles of

 food supplied, which have a certain degree of interest, and in a few instances

 affect an important principle.
     In the four Northumberland gaols the quantity of oatmeal is increased and

 given as porridge where the Government has recommended simply gruel.
 This contains six ounces of oatmeal, instead of two ounces, as ordered for
 gruel, and milk or treacle water. There is also one pound of suet pudding
 given in the third, fourth, and fifth classes in place of the meat, bread, and
 potatoes recommended by Government. It may be questioned if one pound
 of suet pudding is equal to three ounces of cooked meat without bone, half
 a pound of bread, and half a pound of potatoes ; and as the quantities of the
 component articles are not stated, we cannot determine such an inquiry. It
 has, however, this merit, which involves a principle so much neglected in
 prison dietary, viz. the administration of fat with the starch, and is therefore
 so far to be commended. It is also to be noticed to the credit of these in-
 stitutions, that the dietary of the first two classes is better than that recom-
 mended by the Government, since in the first class each prisoner receives
  eight ounces additional oatmeal, besides milk, and in the second class there

  is an addition of eight ounces of potatoes to the dinner. In the return of

 the Alnwick House of Correction there is no provision made for prisoners

  sentenced to a larger term of imprisonment than six weeks, and there is spe-
  cific mention of half a pint of milk in addition to one pint of porridge for the

  breakfast and the supper, but no bread is allowed at those meals.
          ON PRISON DIET AND DISCIPLINE.           73

The other north-country gaols, of Cumberland and Westmoreland, also

make large use of oatmeal and milk in their schemes of diet, and the scheme

is the same in both gaols. The quantity of bread is reduced, and to so re-
prehensible a degree that, for prisoners confined from seven to fourteen days,

--four ounces of bread alone constitute the whole dinner, a quantity of food

less than is supplied at any other prison. For seven days six ounces of bread

are given at each meal ; with hard labour for six weeks, and no labour for
three months, one pint of soup is added to the dinner thrice, one pound of
potatoes thrice, and three quarters of a pint of milk once per week ; and

when the terms are increased to three months, and beyond three months re-

spectively, three ounces of cooked meat and half a pound of potatoes are

given, instead of one pound of potatoes, twice per week. When the sentence

of hard labour is beyond three months, four ounces of uncooked meat, four

ounces of bread, and one pound of potatoes are given for dinner thrice per

week, whilst one pint of soup supplants the meat thrice per week, and three-

quarters of a pint of milk and six ounces of bread constitute the Sunday's
dinner. The use of oatmeal is restricted to the breakfast and supper, when

four or five ounces, with half a pint of milk, without bread, constitute the

meal.

The Monmouth Gaol is also remarkable in the quantity of oatmeal sup-

plied to the prisoners, and for the introduction of Indian meal as an article

of diet. The two first classes are unchanged, except that the term of the

second is extended to four weeks. In the third and fourth classes, which

extend respectively to three months and beyond three months, the breakfast

consists of no less than eight ounces of oatmeal and half a pint of milk, and

the supper of six ounces of oatmeal with half a pint of milk and half a pound

of bread. Both of these are largely in excess of the Government allowances,

and approach much nearer to the wants of the system. The dinner in the

third class consists daily of eight ounces of Indian meal and half a pint of

milk, whilst in the fourth or highest class that food is administered on three

days per week ; four ounces of cooked meat, without bone, and twelve ounces

of potatoes twice, and one pint of broth (containing three ounces of cooked

Wemeat without bone) twice in the week.  believe this to be a better diet-

ary than that recommended by the Government ; and a foot-note appended to
the return is satisfactory on this head. It states : " The general health of

the prisoners is good ; and, for the most part, they leave the prison in better
condition than when they came in. Prisoners of the third and fourth class

are weighed on receipt and discharge ; they are kept in association, and they

almost invariably increase in weight while in prison." It would be interest-

ing to know if they enter with an average weight.

A large division of the gaols which offer peculiarities of detail are the

WeWelsh.  have already remarked that generally the dietary of the gaols

of the Principality is less nutritious than that of English gaols, and we may

further state that only three of the thirteen county gaols have accepted the
Government scheme.

   In the Carmarthen Gaol the prisoners condemned to hard labour for any
term receive meat but twice per week ; and that is in the form of soup, of
which a quart is given ; but the ingredients are not stated ; twelve ounces of

bread are given with it for terms exceeding two months. When the term

exceeds three months two ounces of cheese and one pound of potatoes, or
one pint of gruel, substitute the meat soup on three days per week ; but no
cheese is allowed for shorter periods ; and thus a prisoner may be kept at
hard labour for three months and receive twelve ounces of bread for dinner
--74 REPORT 1861.

daily, with a quart of meat soup twice, and one pound of potatoes, and one
pint of gruel each thrice per weeii. The breakfast and supper invariably

consist of half a pound of bread and one pint of gruel.
   The Carnarvon Gaol introduces a new article of diet, and is unique in

this particular, viz. buttermilk, one pint of which is added to the dinner
twice per week. The whole dietary differs from that recommended by the

Government, and is a subject on which the authorities of the gaol have

either doubt or pride, if we may judge by the multitude of certificates which

they have been pleased to append to the return. In all the classes a pint

to a pint and a half of broth is administered for supper thrice per week

instead of gruel, and given alone in the first two classes, but with six or eight

ounces of bread in all the others. This is made from the meat liquor, with

two ounces of peas, and with green vegetables, and is, therefore, a very valu-

able addition to the dietary. There is a diminution in the quantity of bread

and an increase in that of potatoes in the proportion of two ounces of the

former to half a pound of the latter. Soup is given on three days per week

to prisoners condemned for periods exceeding twenty-one days ; but no meat

is allowed separately, except for longer periods than three months, and then

three ounce's of meat are given separately on three other days per week.

Taken as a whole, it is an improved dietary.

The dietary of the Merioneth Gaol at Dolgelly is full of peculiarities. It

introduces  four  new articles  of diet, viz.  cheese,  bacon,  milk,  and  boiled  rice
                                                                                                      ;

but they are not all given on one day or on any fixed rota, but each is con-

tingent : so that three ounces of bacon meat, without bone, may be substi-

tuted for eight ounces of bread and four ounces of cheese, or one quart of

pea-soup or broth, and four ounces of bread ; and one pound and a half of

boiled rice is regarded as an equivalent for the bread and cheese in one

place, and for half a pound of bread alone in another. One quart of milk
and eight ounces of bread may be substituted once per week for any of the

above dinners. Excepting these various contingencies, which give a com-

plex air, the scheme is simple ; for it only provides for two classes, compre-

hending prisoners condemned, respectively, to fourteen and exceeding four-

teen daj's, without labour; so that a plain bread-and-chee«e dinner, or any of

the above-mentioned alternatives, is considered sufficient for dinner for any

period, however long. Broth or soup is given for dinner to the first class.

The gruel, broth, and pea-soup are each weaker than the gruel and soup re-

Wecommended by the Government.  cannot but regard this dietary as defec-

tive in having so many contingencies, and those which differ much in nutri-

tive value, whilst they are regarded as good substitutes for each other; but

since the average use of each kind of diet is not stated, it is impossible to

estimate the true value of this dietary. The extra food allowed for hard

labour is ridiculously insufficient, viz. six ounces of bread per day ; and the

whole scheme demands immediate revision.

   The Montgomery Gaol also provides bacon as an article of diet to the
highest class, or those exceeding three months' imprisonment. The quantity

allowed is two ounces without bone, added to one pound of potatoes and half

a pound of bread four times per week, whilst on other days the dinner con-

sists of one pint of soup and half a pound of bread. For periods varying

from two weeks to three months, the bacon is omitted. In the first class, one

pint of soup is given on the Sunday, whilst on other days the dinner consists

of half a pound of bread only. Bacon as an article of prison dietary is valu-

able, since it supplies fat, and is also savoury.

viz., scouse, which is composed of beef cut into small pieces, and potatoes,
in such proportion that one pound and a half of scouse contains 2*18 ounces
of meat. This has the very patent evil of inaccurate division to each pri-
soner. The whole dietary is very meagre, since, for all prisoners condemned
to an imprisonment exceeding a month, the dinner thrice per week is one and
a half pound of scouse, half a pound of bread, and one pound of potatoes

four times per week. When the term does not exceed one month, the din-

ner is composed of five and one-third ounces of bread and one pound of
potatoes, whilst for seven days five and one-third ounces of bread only con-

stitutes the dinner.

   In the Glamorgan Gaol at Swansea, the prisoner sentenced to more than
one month's imprisonment receives a bread-and-cheese dinner, as at some
other Welsh gaols; but in this one pound of potatoes is added. This is
given thrice per week, whilst half a pound of bread and a pint and a half of
soup, containing four ounces of coarse meat, are given four times per week.

No meat and cheese are allowed for a less period than one month.

    Space will not permit us to continue the analysis of these returns further

but we may remark that at the Bucks and some other county prisons no

extra food for hard labour is stated in the return ; at the Dorset Gaol, a bread-

and-cheese dinner is provided three times per week for the highest class ; at
Durham the dietary is reduced in value for periods up to six months ; at
Huntingdon there are some meaningless changes in reference to the quantity
of bread allowed; at the Southampton Gaol, three ounces of cheese are
considered an equivalent for one pint of soup containing four ounces of raw
meat without bone, four ounces of potatoes, one ounce of rice, &c. ; and at
Devon, the soup contains but two ounces of raw meat per pint.

   We have thus made it very evident that uniformity in dietary is not one

of the characteristics of our prisons, and that those who are condemned to

imprisonment receive very different treatment in different parts of the king-
dom. Indeed the diversity is so great, that it would be in vain to prepare a
tabular statement of the dietary of the forty-four prisons of such moderate

dimensions, and with so much approach to uniformity, that even the most

painstaking student could study it with the hope of understanding it; for it
would be impossible to reduce the return to more general forms, with a view
of comparing them and committing them to memory.

Freight as affected by Differences in the Dynamic Properties of Steam-

   ships. By Charles Atherton, Chief Engineer, H.M. Dockyard,

    Woolwich.

The national importance of steam shipping is a theme which demands no

demonstration; and any attempt to originate, promulgate, and popularize
inquiry into the comparatively economic capabilities of the steam-ship as
devoted to the international conveyance and interchange of the products of
nature and of manufacturing art, irrespective of its application as an engine
of war, is a task which requires no laboured introduction in support of its
being favourably received for consideration by an association devoted to the
advancement of science.

   The former papers on ' Tonnage,' 'Steam-Ship Capability,' and 'Mercan-
tile Steam Transport Economy,' which tiie author of this further communica-

tion has been permitted to present to the British Association, and which
appear in the volumes of its 'Transactions' for the years 1856, 1857, and
1859, were devoted to an exposition of the technicalities of the subject as
respects the mutual quantitative relations which displacement, speed, power,
and coal hold to each other in the construction and equipment of steam-
ships with a view to the realization of definite steaming results. So far,
therefore, these investigations have had reference to the constructive equip-

ment of steam-ships; but the course of inquiry now submitted for considera-

tion is intended to be a practical exposition of the extent to which the expense
per ton weight of cargo conveyed is affected by the various conditions of
size of ship, dynamic quality of hull with reference to type of form, weight
of hull with reference to its build, the economic properties of the engines
with reference to the consumption of fuel, and the steaming speed at which
the service is required to be performed, all which circumstances, respectively
and in their combinations, affect the economic capabilities of steam-ships for
the conveyance of mercantile cargo, and consequently freights charged, to

an extent not publicly known because hitherto not specially inquired into

nor promulgated by the press, and which in the distinctive details above set
forth do not appear to have been duly appreciated even by the parties most
deeply concerned in the mercantile control and prosecution of steam-shipping

affairs. The aggregate expenses incidental to the prosecution of steam
transport service must generally regulate the average rates of freight at

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,

which goods are conveyed; and, seeing to what an extent the ultimate cost
of manufactured goods is dependent on the cost of transport, often repeated,
as freight charges generally are in the various stages of transition of material
from the raw to its manufactured condition and its ultimate consumption as
a manufactured article, it becomes evident that this investigation especially

concerns the manufacturing interests of the country. Economy of price
inducing quantity of consumption, is the characteristic feature of the manu-

facturing enterprise of the present day ; and it is the absolute cost of goods
which affects consumption, irrespectively of the various causes in detail by

which the cost may have been enhanced. Under these circumstances, it is

remarkable to what extent the manufacturing interests, though keenly alive
to legislative imposts, whether foreign or domestic, affecting the cost of
goods, and sensitively jealous of legislative interference in the control of
labour, as affecting the cost of manufacture, pass wholly unheeded deficien-
cies and imperfections in the practical control of shipping with reference to
freight charges, though equally affecting the ultimate price of manufactures.
 Such incongruity demonstrates the necessity for popular exposition and
inquiry into the various circumstances and combinations of circumstance*

which directly affect the expenses incidental to the conveyance of merchan-

dise by steam-ships, and by which the rates of freight are in the aggregate

necessarily regulated. Freight, therefore, is the text of the following dis-

course, to which attention is directed under the variouc aspects of steam-
ship construction and management, by which freight charge is affected, and

which may be classified under ten heads or sections, as follow :

 --Section A. Freight, as affected by variations of the size of the ship by

                                                                 which the service is performed.

                                                           --with variations of the working economy of the engines.

                                                          K. Freight, as affected by variations of the speed combined

                                                               with variations in the type of form, working economy of the

                                                               engines, and weight of hull.

It will be observed that it is not proposed to determine the actual amount

of prime-cost expenses incidental to the prosecution of steam-ship enterprise,

by which the scale of freight charge may be chiefly regulated, but it is pro-

posed to demonstrate, with reference to a specified unit of performance, the
ratio or comparative scale of cost, in which the prime-cost expenses incidental

to the conveyance of cargo per ton weight of goods conveyed on a given
passage is, cceteris paribus, affected by each of the various circumstances or

conditions set fortli under the ten different heads above referred to.

   The fundamental consideration on which it is proposed to base this inves-

tigation is this, that, within moderate limits of variation, the investment inci-

dental to the fitting-out of steam-ships for commercial transport service is

approximately proportional to the quantity of shipping as measured by the

constructors' load displacement of the ships, and the amount of working-

power employed as measured by the indicated horse-power, also that the

interest on investment, upholding of stock, and all other annual expanses in-

cidental to the working of steam-ships, such as coals, stores, and wages,

harbour dues, insurance, and pilotage, are approximately proportional to such

 --2 1st. Designations of vessels referred to in the sections.

The table (next page) may be interpreted as follows :

--Section A. Freight, as affected (ccsteris paribus) by variations of the

size of ship.

   By reference to the table (next page) it will be observed that as the ship's

size (column 3) is reduced from 5000 tons displacement to 4000 tons, [the
expenses per ton of cargo (column 17) become increased in the ratio of 49
to 51, that is, in the ratio of 100 to 104 (column 18), showing an increase
of 4 per cent.; or, expressed in money, assuming £1 per ton to be the rate

of freight by ship A, of 5000 tons displacement, the rate by ship A,, of

4000 tons displacement will be £1 05. 10c?., and by following the table it

appears that the rate of freight by ship A^, of 3000 tons, will, as compared

with ship A, of 5000, be increased 8 per cent., amounting to £1 \s, 8d.

per ton.

   The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods (column 20)
by the vessels A, Aj, A^, respectively would be £100,000, £104,000 and

£108,000.

    Thus, in a merely mechanical point of view, and irrespectively of various

mercantile and nautical considerations which may limit the size of ships, we

see the benefit of performing goods transport service by large vessels in pre-

ference to small ones,' provided that adequate cargo be always obtained and

that no delay be thereby incurred. But it is to be observed that if the

5000-tons ship A, instead of being loaded with its full cargo of 2395 tons,

be loaded only with the quantity of cargo (1878 tons) that could be carried

by the 4000-tons ship, A,, the freight expenses per ton of cargo would, in

this case, be enhanced in the proportion of 63 to 49, that is, in the proportion

of 128 to 100, or 28 per cent., or, expressed in monej', in the proportion of

£1 4s. lOd. to £1, the same being a higher rate by 24 per cent, than the
freight charge at which the 4000-tons ship, Aj, would perform the service.

By pursuing the calculations from the data adduced by the table, it will be

found that the economic advantage of the 5000-tons ship. A, as compared

with the 4000-tons ship. A,, wilt be entirely sacrificed if its cargo be reduced

from 2395 tons to 2305 tons, or be only 90 tons, or 3J per cent, deficient
of its full load. Also, as compared with the ship A,, of 3000 tons, the

Aadvantage of the 5000-tons ship will be lost if its cargo be reduced from

2395 tons to 2218, or be only 117 tons deficient of its full load.
   Hence it appears that the superior economic capabilities of large ships in

a mechanical point of view for the conveyance of goods may, in a mercantile
point of view, be very soon sacrificed by mismanagement in assigning larger
vessels for the discharge of mercantile service than is demanded by the trade,

notwithstanding the economic superiority of large ships when promptly and

fully loaded.

  --Section B. Freight, as affected {rcBteris paribus) by variations in the

constructive type of torm of the hull.

   The relative constructive efficiency of mercantile ships in a purely dynamic

point of view, as respects type of form (irrespectively of materials and
workmanship), is now generally recognized as being determined by their co-

efficients (C^ of dynamic performance, as deduced from actual trial of the

--ships, and calculated by the following formulaV^ D2-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 :j  . .'' =0, which may be

expressed as follows :

--88 REPORT 18G1.

    Multiply the cube of the speed (V^) by the cube root of the square of the
displacement (D|), and divide the product by the indicated horse-power
(Ind. h. p.) ; the quotient will be the coefficient (C) of dynamic performance.

   To enter upon the various uses to which this formula is applied would be
irrelevant to the matter now under consideration. Suffice it to say that

the numeral co-efficient obtained as above set forth affords practically a
means by which the mutual relations of displacement, power, and speed
of a steam-ship of given type of form, and of which the coefficient is

known, may (ccBteris paribus) be deduced, and it affords a criterion indi-

cating, whatever be the size of the ship, the constructive adaptation of its

--type of form for mechanical propulsion, as compared with other types of

form tested by the same rule the condition of the vessels as respects clean-
ness of immersed surface, stability, and other essential properties, being
assumed to be the same ; and we now proceed to show to what extent,
under given conditions, freight per ton of goods conveyed is affected by-
variations of type of form, as represented by variations of the coefficient

of performance.

   By reference to the table (Section B), it will be observed that as the

co-efficient of dynamic performance is reduced from 250 to 150, the ex-
penses become increased in the ratio of 100 to 132, or 32 per cent, or,
assuming the freight by ship A, of which the coefficient of dynamic per-
formance is 250, to be at the rate of £1 per ton of cargo, the charge by
ship Bj, of the same size, but of which the coefficient is 200, will be
£1 2s., being an increase of 10 per cent.; and the charge by ship B^, of
the same size, but of which the coefficient is 150, will be £1 6s. 5d., being
an increase of 32 per cent., as compared with the rate of freit(ht by ship
A, of which the coefficient is 250.

   The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods by the vessels
A, Bj, B,, respectively, would be £100,000, £110,000. and £132,000.

    Seeing, therefore, that variations of the type of form, as indicated by
variations of the coefficient of dynamic performance, even within the limits
of 250 and 150, which are of ordinary occurrence in steam-shipping, affect
the expenses incidental to the conveyance of mercantile cargo, under the con-
ditions referred to, to the extent of 32 per cent,, the coefficient of dynamic
performance which a ship may be capable of realizing, being thus (cateris
paribus) a criterion of the economic working of the ship with reference to
power, becomes a highly important matter for directorial consideration in the

purchasing or disposal of steam-ships.

   Section C Freight as affected (cwteris paribus) by variations in the

working economy of the engines with reference to coal.
    The relative working economy of marine engines as respects the con-

sumption of coal per indicated horse-power per hour is evidently an important

--element for consideration as affecting freight, to illustrate which, it has been

assumed that variations in mercantile practice extend from 2 lbs. per indicated

horse-power per hour to 4 lbs. The consumption of so little as 2 lbs. per
indicated horse-power per hour is not usually attained, but being now ad-
mitted to have been achieved, and such having become a matter of contract
stipulation, it may be looked forward to as the probable future consumption

on board ship generally, although the ordinary consumption of existing
steamers cannot at the present time be rated at less than 4lbs. per indicated

horse-power per hour.

    By reference to the table (Section C), it appears that, under the special

conditions of the service under consideration (namely vessels of 5000 tons
displacement employed on a passage of 3000 nautical miles, and steaming at
        ON FREIGHT AS AFFECTED BY DYNAMIC PROPERTIES. 89

the speed of 10 knots an hour), by increasing the consumption of coal from
2 lbs. to 4 lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour, the expense per ton of
goods conveyed becomes increased in the proportion of 49 to 56, that is, in
the proportion of 100 to 114, being an increase of 14 percent., or, assuming
the freight by the standard ship A, consuming 2 lbs. of coal per indicated
horse-power per hour, to be at the rate of £1 per ton of cargo conveyed, the
rate of freight by ship C^, consuming 3 lbs. per indicated horse-power per
hour, will be £1 Is. '2d., being an increase of 6 per cent., and the rate of
freight by ship C^, consuming 4 lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour, will be

£\ 2s. \0d., being an increase of 14 per cent, per ton of goods conveyed

under the conditions referred to.

   The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods by the vessels

--A, C,, Cj, respectively would be £100,000, £106,000, and £114,000.
    Section D. Freight charge as affected (cteteris parihvs) by variations in

the constructive weight of hull with reference to the size of the ship as de-
termined by the load displacement.

   To illustrate this matter it has been assumed that the weight of hull,

including the whole equipment complete for sea (exclusive of engines, coal,

and cargo) may vary from 40 per cent, of the load displacement to 60 per
cent., under which limitations, by reference to table (Section D), it appears
that, under the special conditions of the service underjconsideration, by in-
creasing the weight of hull from 40 per cent, of its displacement to 60 per

cent., and assuming the cost of the hull to be in proportion to its weight of
materials, the expenses or freight charge per ton of cargo conveyed become
increased in the proportion of 49 to 120, that is, in the proportion of 100 to
245, being an increase of 140 per cent., or, assuming the freight charge by
the standard ship A, of which the weight of hull is 40 per cent, of the load
displacement (2000 tons) to be at the rate of £1 per ton of goods conveyed, the
rate of freight by ship T)^, of v/hich the weight of hull is 50 per cent, of the
load displacement (2500 tons), will be £1 10s. Id, per ton, being an increase
of 53 per cent., and by ship Dj, of which the weight of hull is 60 per cent,

of the load displacement (3000 tons), the rate of freight becomes £2 9s. per

ton, being an increase of 145 per cent, per ton of goods conveyed under the

conditions referred to.

   The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods by the vessels

A, Dj, D,, respectively, would be £100,000, £153,000, and £245,000.
   Hence,in the construction of steam-ships we see the importance of quality of

material and excellence of fastening as a means of reducing weight, and the dis-
advantage that attends heavy-built ships, such as war-steamers, for discharging
mercantile service. Hence also we see the deficient steaming endurance or
limited armament of high-speed armoured ships unless built of enormous
size, as measured by their load displacement, and the disadvantage of types of
form which require the aid of ballast to insure stability.

  --Section E. Freight is affected (cceferis paribus) by variations in the

constructive type of form combined with variations in the working economy

of the engines.

   By reference to the Table (Section E), it appears, under the special con-

ditions of the service under consideration, that by an inferior type of form, as
indicated by the coefficient of perlormance being reduced from 250 to 1.50,
combined with an inferior construction of engines, as indicated by the con-
sumption of fuel being increased from 2 lbs. to 4lbs. per indicated horse-power
per hour, thereby reducing the coefficient of dynamic duty (column 7) from
14,000 to 4200, the expense or freight charge per ton of goods conveyed
becomes increased in tfie ratio of 100 to 179, being an increase of 79 per
90 REPORT 1861.

cent. ; or, assuming the freight charge by the standard ship A, of which the
coefficient of performance is 250 and rate of consumption 2 lbs. per indicated
horse-power per hour (giving a coefficient of dynamic duty 14,000), to be at
the rate of £1 per ton of goods conveyed, the rate of freight by ship E^, of
which the coefficient ofperforniance is 200, and consumption of coals 3lbs. per
indicated horse-power per hour (coefficient of dynamic duty 7467) becomes
,361 4s. per ton, being an increase of 20 per cent., and by ship E^, of
which the coefficient of performance is 150, and the consumption of coal at the
rate of 4 lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour (coefficient of dynamic

duty 4200), the rate of freight becomes £1 15s. Wd., being an increase of

79 per cent, per ton of goods conveyed under the conditions referred to.
The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods bv the vessels A,
Ej, E,, respectively, would be 36100,000, ^6120,000, and ^179,000.

    Hence, in the control of steam-shipping, we see the importance of the co-
efficient of dynamic duty (column 7), as indicating the economic efficiency

of the ship in a mercantile point of view, with reference to the merits of her

hull and engine construction being made a subject of contract stipulation.

  --Section F. Freight as aWected (cceteris paribus) by variations in the size

of the ship combined with variations in the constructive type of form and in
the working economy of the engines.

   By reference to the Table (Section F), it appears, under the special con-

ditions of service under consideration, that by the size of the ship being
reduced from 5000 tons displacement to 3000 tons displacement, combined
with an inferior type of form, as indicated by the coefficient of performance
being reduced from 250 to 150, and an inferior construction of engine, as
indicated by the consumption of coals being increased from 2 lbs. to 4 lbs. per
indicated horse-power per hour, the expense or freight charge per ton of
goods conveyed becomes increased in the ratio of 49 to 113, that is, in the
ratio of 100 to 230, being an increase of 130 per cent.; or, assuming the
freight by the standard ship A, of 5000 tons, of which the coefficient of per-
formance is 250, and the consumption of coal at the rate of 2 lbs. per indicated

horse-power per hour, to be at the rate of ^1 per ton of goods conveyed, the

rate of freight by ship F^, of 4000 tons, of which the coefficient of per-
formance is 200 and the consumption of coal at the rale of 3 lbs. per indicated
horse-power per hour, will be a61 5s. '2d., being an increase of 26 per cent., and
by ship Fj, of 3000 tons displacement, of which the coefficient of performance
is 150 and the consumption of coal at the rate of 4 lbs. per indicated horse-
power per hour, the rate of freight becomes ^62 6s., being an increase of 130
per cent, per ton of goods conveyed under the conditions referred to.

   The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods by the vessels
A, Fj, F,, respectively, would be ^6100,000, 36126,000, and ^6230,000.

   Hence also we observe by comparison of ships E.^ and F,, how important
becomes the question of magnitude when ships of inferior dynamic duty are

employed on a given service, the comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons
of goods conveyed by the vessels E, and F^, on the service referred to, being
^6179,000 and 36230,000, being an increase of 28 per cent, solely in conse-
quence of the magnitude of the ship being reduced from 5000 tons displace-
ment to 3000 tons, the coefficient of dynamic duty (4200) being in both

--cases the same.
   Section G. Freight as affected (cceteris paribus) by variations of the
steaming speed at which it is required that the service shall be performed.

   It is proposed to illustrate this most important elemental consideration by
reference to rates of speed within the range of present practice, namely, from
10 to 14 knots per hour.
ON FREIGHT AS AFFECTED BY DYNAMIC PROPERTIES. 91

By reference to the Table (Section G), it appears that, under the special

conditions of the service under consideration, by increasing the speed from

10 to 12 knots per hour, the expense or required rate of freight per ton of

goods conveyed becomes increased in the ratio of 49 to 64, that is, in the

ratio of 100 to 131, being an increase of 31 per cent.; and by increasing the

speed from 10 to 14 knots, the expense, or required rate of freight per ton of

goods, becomes increased in the ratio of 49 to 93, that is, in the ratio of 100

to 182, being an increase of 82 per cent. Hence, assuming the freight by the

standard ship A, of 5000 *ons, making a passage of 3000 nautical miles at

10 knots per hour, to be at the rate of £1 per ton weight of goods conveyed,

the rate of freight by ship Gj, steaming at 12 knots per hour, will be required

to be £1 6s. 2d. per ton weight of goods conveyed, and the rate of freight by

ship Gj, steaming at 14knots per hour, will be required to be £1 I6s. 5d. per

ton of goods conveyed. The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons

of goods, by the vessels A, Gj, G.,, steaming at 10, 12, and 14 knots per hour

respectively, would be jei00,000,"3ei31,000, and 36182,000.

Hence we see how onerous are the obligations which usually impose on

mail-packets a rate of speed higher than that which would be adopteil for

prosecuting a purely mercantile service ; and as no service can be permanently

and satisfactorily performed which does not pay, it follows that the inade-

quacy, if any, of a high-speed postal subsidy must be made "up by surcharge

H --on passengers and cargo, and is therefore, pro tanto, a tax upon trade.
Section  Freight a.s SiSecieA {cceteris paribus) by variations of the size

of ships combined with variations of steaming-speed.

  We will suppose the size of the ships to be 5000, 4000, and .3000 tons

displacement, and the steaming-speed to be at the rates of 10 knots, 12 knots,

and 14 knots per hour respectively.

By reference to the Table (Section H), it appears that, under the special

conditions of the service under consideration, by reducing the size of the ship

from 5000 to 4000 tons, and increasing the speed from 10 to 12 knots per

hour, the expense or required freight charge becomes increased in the ratio

of 49 to 66, that is, in the ratio of 100 to 134, or 34 per cent. ; and by re-

ducing the size of ship from 5000 to 3000 tons, and increasing the speed

from lO knots to 14 knots, the required frfight charge becomes increased

in the ratio of 49 to 1 19, that is, in the ratio of 100 to 243, being an increase

of 143 per cent., or a multiple of 2y times nearly. Hence, assuming the

rate of freight by the standard ship A, of 5000 tons, steaming at 10 knots, to

be at £1 per ton weight of goods conveyed, the required rate of freight by

ship Hj, of 4000 tons, steaming at 12 knots, will be £i 6s. 10c?., and the

required rate of freight charge by ship H^, steaming at 14 knots per hour,

will be at the rate of £2 8s. Id. per ton weight of goods conveyed.

The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods by the vessels

A, Hj, H,, respectively, will be ^6100,000, ^ei 34,000, and ^6243,000.

   Hence also we observe by comparison of ships G^ and H^, how important
becomes the question of magnitude when the service demands a high rate of

speed, the comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods conveyed
by the vessels G^ and H^, on the service referred to, being £182,000 and

£243,000, being an increase of 33y per cent., solely in consequence of the

ship being reduced from 5000 tons displacement to 3000 tons, the coefficient

--of dynamic duty (14,000) being in both cases the same.
   Section I. Freight as affected by variations of speed combined with
variations of the working economy of the engines.

   Assuming the rate of speed to be 10 knots, 12 knots, and 14 knots, and
the consumption of coal to be 2 lbs., 3 lbs. and 4 lbs. per indicated horse-power
92 REPORT-- 1861.

per hour respectively, bj' reference to the Table (Section I.) it appears that
by increasing the speed from 10 knots to 12 knots an hour, the rate of con-
sumption of coal being also increased from 2 lbs. to 3 lbs. per indicated horse-
power per hour, the required freight charge becomes increased in the ratio of
49 to 72, that is, in the ratio of 100 to 14-7, or 47 per cent. ; and by increasing
the speed from 10 knots to 14 knots per hour, the rate of consumption of
coal being also increased from 2 lbs. to 4 lbs. per indicated horse-power per
hour, the required freight charge becomes increased in the ratio of 49 to 152,
that is, in the ratio of 100 to 310, being an increase of 210 per cent., or
more than trebled. Hence, assuming the expense or required freight charge
by the standard ship A, steaming at lOknots per hour, and consuming 2 lbs.

coal per indicated horse-power per hour, to be at the rate of £1 per ton of

goods conveyed, the required freight charge by ship 1^, steaming at 12 knots
an hour and consuming 3 lbs. of coal per indicated horse-power per hour, will
be at the rate of sfil Gs.Sd.per ton of goods, and the required freight charge
by ship I3, steaming at 14 knots per hour and consuming 4 lbs. of coal per
indicated horse-power per hour, will be at the rate of 363 25. per ton of goods

conveyed. The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods by the
vessels A, I,, I^, respectively, would be 36100,000 36147,000, and 36310,000.

   Hence we see how onerous are the obligations of increased speed, if at-

tempted to be performed with engines of inferior contruction, as respects
economy of fuel.

  --Section K. Freight as affected (c^tens paribus) by variations of the

speed combined with variations in the type of form, working economy of the
engines, and weight of hull.

   The object of this section is to show the effect even of small differences
of practical construction, when operating collectively to the detriment of a
ship, combined with the obligation of increased speed.

   By reference to the Table (Section K) it appears that, under the special

conditions of the service under consideration, by increasing the speed from
10 to 12 knots, with a ship of inferior type of form, as indicated by the co-
efficient of performance being reduced from 250 to 225, and of inferior
engine arrangement, as indicated by the consumption of fuel being increased
from 2 to 3 lbs. per indicated horse-power per hour, the weight of hull being
also increased 5 per cent., namely, from 40 per cent, to 45 per cent, of the

--constructor's load displacement, by this combination, the expense per ton of

goods conveyed becomes increased in the proportion of 49 to 102, that is, in the
proportionof J 00 to208,beinganincreaseof 108 per cent.,or more than doubled ;

Aor, assuming the freight by the standard ship to be at the rate of £1 per ton,

the rate of freight by ship Kj, under the differences above referred to,
becomes £2 \s. Sd.; and it is to observed that if the speed be increased to 14
knots, whilst at the same time the coefficient of performance is reduced to
200, the consumption of fuel increased from 2 lbs. to 4lbs. per indicated horse-
power per hour, and the weight of the hull increased 10 per cent., namely, from

--40 per cent, of the load displacement to 50 per cent., under these conditions

the entire load displacement of the ship K^ will be appropriated by the weight
of the hull, engines, and coal, leaving no displacement whatever available
for cargo ; that is to say, the vessel K^ is utterly unable to perform the con-

ditions of the service as a mercantile steamer.

   The comparative freight charges on 100,000 tons of goods by the vessels

A and K, respectively would be £100,000 and £208,000.

   Having thus fully explained the Table, it may be observed that, as re-
spects the relation which subsists between the dynamic properties of vessel
A, taken as the standard of comparison in the foregoing sections, and the
ON FREIGHT AS AFFECTED BY DYNAMIC PROPERTIES. 93

dynamic properties of mercantile steam-ships generally at the present time,
it might be regarded as invidious to refer to and particularize the actual per-

formances of vessels presentlj' employed on commercial service ; but it may

be affirmed generally that the ocean performance of mercantile steam-fleets

does not average a coefficient of economic duty, by the formula      ^

                                                                          ,

exceeding 5600, whilst modern naval architecture and engineering have prac-

tically shown that with certain types of form the coefficient of performance

may be expected to vary fr^m 250 to 300, and that some engines of modern

construction have consumed only from 2 lbs. to 2| lbs. of coal per indicated

horse-power per hour, thus practically constituting a possible coefficient of

economic duty as high as 14,000, which has therefore been assigned to ship

A in the foregoing table, and whereby, under the conditions of the service

referred to, viz. ships of 5000 tons displacement steaming at 10 knots per

hour on a passage of 3000 miles, the conveyance of goods per ton weight

may be expected to be performed at fully 30 per cent, less cost than would

be necessarily incurred under the same circumstances by vessels of the same

size, but of which the coefficient of economic duty does not exceed 5600 ; and

this comparative difference would be greatly exceeded if the size of ships be

reduced, the length of passage increased, or the speed accelerated.

From the foregoing statements it appears that public interests in the great

matter of Freight demand that steam-ships only of the most effective con-

struction, as respects hull and engines, be employed on mercantile service.

Bad types of hull and wasteful engines, necessarily, as we have seen, enhance

freight, increase the cost of production, and consequently curtail consumption,

Athus constituting a blight on national industry.  check on these evils,

highly conducive to the gradual reduction of freight expenses by steam-ships,

would at once be instituted by making it a matter of contract slipula-

tion that a definite coefficient of dynamic duty, by the formula ·   ^

should be realized on test trial of the ship, at the builder's load displacement
and steaming at the stipulated speed. Unquestionably, for years past, in our
popular marine engineering, prejudice and expediency have retarded pro-
gress ; marine engineering practice has not duly availed itself of the established
truths and science of the times : expansion, superheating, and surface con-

densation, now being reanimated as the basis of modern improvements, are

but the legacies of a bygone age hitherto neglected.

    It is only by directing public opinion to bear on such subjects of general
interest, that any prevalent evil can be corrected ; and surely an appeal on
the important subject of " freight," as affected by differences in the dynamic

properties of steam-ships, cannot be more appropriately made to any public
body than to the British Association, under the presidency of a man especially
distinguished and honoured in the path of practical science, and assembled
at Manchester, the birth-place of free trade, and the manufacturing capital

of the world.

Report on the Progress of Celestial Photography since the Aberdeen

            Meeting. By Warren De la Rce, F.R.S.

At the Aberdeen Meeting I had the honour of communicating to this

Section a Report on the State of Celestial Photography in England, which

has since appeared in the Transactions of the Association.

   Since that period I have pursued my investigations in this branch of

astronomy, and have ascertained some facts which 1 believe will be of interest

to the Meeting.

   In the first place I beg to recall to the recollection of Members who may
have read my paper, and to re-state for the information of those who have not

done so, that it was intended at the period of the Aberdeen meeting that the

Kew photo-heliograph should be taken to Spain in order, ifpossible, to photo-

graph the luminous prominences, or, as they are usually called, the red

flames, seen on the occasion of a total solar eclipse.

The words implying a doubt as to the success of the undertaking were

advisedly inserted, because very little information could be collected from the

accounts of those observers who had witnessed previous total eclipses, as to

the probable intensity of the light of the corona and red flames in comparison

Mywith that of other luminous bodies.  impression was that I should fail in

depicting the prominences in the time available for doing so, because I had had

the Kew instrument tried upon the moon and had failed utterly in getting even

a trace of her image on the sensitive plate, and the corona and prominences

together were not supposed to give as much light as the moon. I therefore
pointed out the desirability of other astronomers making attempts to depict

the phenomena of totality by projecting the image of the prominences direct

on to the collodion-plate without enlarging it by a secondary magnifier, as is

done in the Kew instrument.

   It was fair to assume, with the great experience I had acquired in celestial

photography, that I should succeed with the Kew instrument if success were

attainable ; and I knew that far more reliable results would be obtained by

its means than by the other method, which I recommended simply because it
seemed to me to offer a greater chance of at least a partial success.

   Two theories existed, as is well known, to account for the red prominences.

The one, prominently supported by the Astronomer Royal, was that they
belonged to the sun ; the other, which is still supported even by an astrono-
mer who obtained photographs of them at the last eclipse, was that they are
produced by the diff"raction of the sun's light by the periphery of the moon.

   It will be seen, therefore, not only how essential it was to obtain photo-
graphic images of the prominences, but also how important it was to obtain
such perfect images of them that they could not be confounded with
purely diff'ractive phenomena if such existed, and that the images should be
on such a scale that the defects common to collodion could not be confounded
with them. "The pretty near" would have been far more readily accom-

plished ; but having the whole bearing of the subject fully impressed on

my mind, I preferred to make a bold venture, and either accomplish what I

aimed at or fail entirely.

Fortunately 1 was successful, and to that success the steadiness of my

Westaff much contributed.   now know that the luminous prominences

which surround the sun (for they do belong to him) can be depicted in

from 20 to 60 seconds, on the scale of the sun's diameter equal ^ of the
object-glass employed. That is to say, an object-glass of 3 inches aperture

will give a picture of the prominences surrounding the moon 4 inches in

diameter.
                                   ON THE PROGRESS OP CELESTIAL PHOTOGRAPHY.                          95

   The next subject to which I have to call your attention is the photographic

--depiction of groups of stars for example, such as form a constellation like

--Orion, in other words, the mapping down the stars by means of photography.

I have made several experiments in this direction, and have obtained satis-

factory results, and I believe that at last I have hit upon an expedient

which will render this method of mapping stars easy of accomplishment.

The instrument best adapted for this object is a camera of short focal length

--compared with its aperture, Jike the ordinary portrait-camera, the size of the

lens being selected to suit the scale of the intended photographic map, and the

camera, of course, mounted on an equatorial stand with a clock-work motion.

The fixed stars depict themselves with great rapidity on a collodion-

plate; and I have experienced no difficulty in obtaining pictures of the

Pleiades by a moderate exposure even in the focus of my telescope ; they
would be fixed much more rapidly by a portrait-camera. The difficulty

in star-mapping does not consist in the difficulty of fixing the images of

stars, but in finding the images when they are imprinted ; for they are no

bigger than the specks common to the best collodion. It is of no service

attempting to overcome the difficulty by enlarging the whole picture ; but

something may be done by causing the images of the stars, which are

mere spots, to spread out into a cone of rays by putting the image out of

focus and thus imprinting a disc on the plate instead of a point. Last year
was so fully employed that I have not yet had time to develope fully this

method, but I have ascertained its practicability.

Some curiosity naturally exists as to the possibility of applying photo-

graphy to the depiction of those wonderful bodies the comets, which arrive

generally without anything being known of their previous history and abso-

lutely nothing as to their physical nature. It would be valuable to have
photographic records of them, especially of the nucleus and corona, which
undergo changes from day to day; and hence such a means of recording

these changes as photography ofl^ers would be the best, beyond comparison, if

the light of the comet were sufficiently intense to imprint itself.

On the appearance of Donati's comet in 1858 I made several unsuccessful
attempts to delineate it with my reflector on a collodion film, but without

success                            and  on  the  appearance  of  the  comet  of the present year I made
                                ;

numerous attempts to depict it, not only with my telescope, but also with a

portrait-camera; but, even M'ith an exposure of 15 minutes (minutes, not

seconds), I failed in getting the slightest impression, even with a portrait-
lens. Hence the conclusion may be arrived at that the actinic ray does not

exist in sufficient intensity in such a comet as that of 1861 to imprint itself,

and therefore photography at present is inapplicable to the recording of the
appearances of these wonderful bodies.

I now return to Heliography. Experiments conducted at the Kew
Observatory by my request have shown that, for an image of the sun of any
given size, when once the aperture of the telescope has been ascertained
which IS sufficient to produce the picture with the necessary degree of
rapidity, it is not beneficial to increase that aperture ; that is to say, no more
details are depicted, nor does the picture become sharper, so as to bear a
greater subsequent enlargement in copying, than when the smaller aperture
IS used. It has also been established, experimentally, that it is not well to
enlarge the image beyond a certain point by increasing the magnifyine
power of the secondary magnifier
very great angle. These results                               and thus to cause the rays to emerge    at a
                                                             are such as I should have anticipated ·   but
as It was, nevertheless, desirable to produce i)ictures of the sun's spots.'with

produced by the Kew instrument, I commenced some preparations at my

own observatory for the purpose of trying whether it would be possible to

procure sucli pictures with my reflector. On maturing my plans I found that

the apparatus which it would be necessary to use would be so weighty that

the telescope would require to be strengthened considerably to support the

additional weight in the awkward position in which it would have to be placed ;
and it did not at first appear how this could be ronveniently done.

Ultimately I found the means of adding a radius-bar and of supporting the

plate-holder, which carries a plate 18 inches square at a distance of 4> feet

from the eye-piece ; but here another difficulty occurred, namely, that the

image of the sun was so powerfully heating, that, if allowed to remain for a

very short time on the instantaneous slide, it heated it and ultimately set fire

Ato some part of the apparatus.         trap easy to be moved over the mouth

of the telescope had to be contrived, so as to open just before the instantane-

ous apparatus was brought into action and shut again immediately after-

wards. At last these mechanical difficulties were surmounted, and I
commenced my experiments to ascertain the best form for the secondary mag-

nifier : these experiments are still in progress, and some important difficulties

remain to be overcome before pictures of the sun's spots will be obtained

with that degree of sharpness which shall leave nothing to be desired.

With an ordinary Huyghenian eye-piece, employed as a secondary magnifier

and placed somewhat nearer the great mirror than would be its position for the

most perfect optical picture, in order to throw the chemical rays further on and

thus bring them to focus on the plate, I have obtained some sun-pictures, of

very considerable promise, on the extremely large scale of the sun's diameter

equal to 3 feet. These pictures have only been very recently procured, and

I submit them to the Section because I believe that an interest is felt in the

progress of celestial photography, and that the Members prefer to take part

in the experiments, as it were, by watching their progress, rather than to

wait until the most perfect results have been brought about. I may state

that the mechanical and chemical difficulties have been surmounted, and that

the only outstanding one is the form of the secondary magnifier*. When this

has been worked out, perfect sun-pictures 3 feet in diameter will be obtain-

able with a telescope of 1 foot aperture, in less than the 20th of a second

of time. These pictures, when taken under suitable circumstances, may be

grouped so as to produce stereoscopic pictures, which must throw consider-

able light on the nature of the spots.

It appears to me that such results must be of value to science, and that

the records of the state of the sun's photosphere, both as regards spots and

other changing phenomena, which are obtainable by means of photography,

are worth collecting and discussing, and that ultimately they will throw con-

siderable light on terrestrial meteorology.

It is agreeable to me to work at this problem so as to point out the means

by which success is attainable, and I may for a time carry on the records ;

but it will, on reflection, be seen that these observations (if continued, as

they should be, for years) are likely to prove a too serious tax upon the

leisure and purse of a private individual.

   * Mr. Dallmeyer has lately assisted me in working out this problem, and has produced
already two new secondary magnifiers, each of a somewhat different construction. With their
aid I made a considerable step in advance, but on November 7th, 1861, was stopped by the

lateness of the season.
       ON THE THEORY OF EXCHANGES.      97

            On the Theory of Exchanges, audits recent extension.

                        By Balfour Stewart, A.M.

 It is now somewhere about seventy years since Professor Pierre Prevost

 of Geneva conceived the rudimentary idea which ultimately became de-

 veloped into the Theory of Exchanges. In the 'Journal de Physique' for

April 1791, we find a memoir by him "'On the Equilibrium of Heat;" and

from that period until 1832 he wrote many memoirs in confirmation and

 extension of his views.

    The leading feature of this hypothesis is perhaps best expressed in the words

which Prevost himself employed to characterize it, when he called his theory

that of a moveable equilibrium of temperature.

    In order to comprehend more precisely the meaning of this phrase, let us

imagine to ourselves a large vacuum-chamber, the walls of which are black,

and do not reflect light or heal. Lampblack will therefore be the most

appropriate substance with which to cover them. Let us also suppose that

the whole chamber is kept at a uniform temperature, and that we place a
thermometer in the enclosure. It is well known that this thermometer will

ultimately denote the same temperature to whatever portion of the enclosure
it may be carried, and that this temperature will be that of the Avails of the

--chamber. The bulb of the instrument is therefore in a state of equilibrium

with regard to heat, a condition of things brought about and sustained, not
by currents of air, since the chamber is supposed to be a vacuum, but by that

faculty called radiation, in virtue of which a hot body communicates its heat

to a distant cold one, even through an absolutely vacant space. This equili-

brium may be of two kinds.

   1. It may be a statical or tensional equilibrium, that is to say, an equili-

brium of repose, in which, from the exact balancing of two opposite tendencies,

the bulb of the thermometer neither receives heat nor gives it away.

   2. It may also be an active, or, as Prevost calls it, a moveable equilibrium,
in which the bulb is constantly giving away heat to the enclosure and re-
ceiving back in return precisely as much as it gives away, so that its tem-

perature is neither increased nor diminished.

 --It was this latter view of the subject which Prevost took, a view which,

besides having a certain amount of inherent probability, has, I think, earned
a fair claim, from the great number of facts which it groups together under

one law, to be viewed as a correct expression of the truth. To return to our

thermometer: the bulb, under the circumstances above mentioned, is supposed
by this theory to be constantly giving forth radiant heat at a rate depending
only on the temperature of the bulb, and independent of that of the enclosure.

On the other hand, it is receiving back from tiie enclosure an amount of heat

depending only on the temperature of the enclosure, and wholly independent

of that of the bulb. Thus its expenditure depends upon its own temperature,
its receipts upon that of the enclosure, and when these two are of the same
temperature, the expenditure of the bulb is exactly balanced by its receipts.

   The circumstance which seems to have brought this idea vividly before
the mind of Prevost, was the well-known experiment by whicii Professor
Pictet* showed what may be termed the reflexion and concentration of cold.
That philosopher took two concave reflectors, making them face one another,

and while in the focus of the one he placed a thermometer, in that of the
other he placed a lump of ice, the effect of which was tliat flic temperature

of the thermometer immediately began to fall. If we admit that cold is a
positive principle, and not a mere negation, we shall of course be able to ex-

plain this experiment as easily as if a hot bulb had been placed in the one

focus, raising the temperature of the thermometer in the other. But this

explanation being inadmissible, it occurred to Prevost that the theory of

a moveable equilibrium would account for the phenomenon. Let us adopt

this hypothesis, and suppose, in the first instance, that a body of the same

temperature as the thermometer is placed in the other focus. It is obvious

that this body will not aflPect the thermometer. Heat is doubtless con-
tinually leaving the bulb ; but this receives back precisely as much heat as it
radiates, a considerable portion of that which it receives being the heat which

leaves the body in the opposite focus, and which by the laws of reflexion is

concentrated on the bulb. If we next suppose that the other body is of a

higher temperature than the thermometer, it is easy to see that the same laws

of reflexion will cause an increase of heat to be especially felt by the bulb,

since each of the rays of heat which reach it by virtue of the reflector will

be more intense than the corresponding ray which it gives away. Should,

however, the body in the opposite focus be of a lower temperature than the

thermometer, the rays which the former emits, and which, by virtue of the

reflector, reach the bulb, will all be less intense than the corresponding rays which

the bulb gives forth, and thus the same cause which formerly made the ther-

mometer peculiarly sensitive to an increase in the temperature of the opposite

body, will now make it equally sensitive to a diminution of the same.

  We are thus furnished by the theory of exchanges with an explanation of this

important experiment, which, it is remarked by Prevost in his first memoir of

1791» cannot well be explained by an immoveable equilibrium.

  When Leslie* published his experiments on Heat, the theory of exchanges

was not slow to exhibit that appropriating quality which is ever the mark

of truth. In the hands of Prevost, these experiments, instead of demand-

ing a new hypothesis, were easily explained by means of the old one. Let

us take, for instance, the fact discovered by Leslie, that good reflectors of

heat, such as metals, are bad radiators. Prevost (in a treatise on Radiant Heat,

Paris, 1809) shows how this fact follows from his theory, remarking that in

a place of uniform temperature a reflector does not alter the distribution of

heat, which it would do if, joined to a good reflecting power, it possessed also
that of being a good radiator. It is interesting to note Prevost's mode of

expressing himself on this subject, as it shows that he entertained an opinion

Hecorrect, as far as it went, with regard to internal radiation.  conjectures

that a good reflector is a bad radiator, because, as it reflects the heat from

without, so it also reflects the heat from within.

Lambertf of Berlin, and Leslie, both proved by experiment that the radia-

tion of a heated surface in any direction is proportional to the sine of the

angle which this direction makes with the surface ; and it was demonstrated

by FourierJ that this law is the necessary consequence of the theory of ex-

changes, in those cases where the reflecting power of the body may be dis-

regarded. He shows, in this demonstration, that if we refuse to admit the

truth of the law of sines, and suppose that the intensity of the rays emitted

does not vary with the obliquity of the surface, a central molecule can

only acquire a temperature equal to half that of the surrounding enclosure-

Fourier accompanied this proof with an attempt to account for the law of

sines, in which he supposes that there is in every case a physical surface of

very small thickness, in which surface the radiant heat emitted by a body

takes its rise ; but, with the knowledge which we now possess, this cannot, I

think, be considered a very happy explanation.

ON THE THEORY OP EXCHANGES.                                        99

I now come to the researches of Dulong and Petit on Radiation* (trans-

lated in the ' Annals of Philosophy,' vol. xiii. p. 241), which afford a peculiar

evidence in favour of the theory of exchanges. In order to perceive the bear-

ing of this evidence, let us take the case of a black body, say a thermometer

with a blackened bulb, cooKng in a black enclosure, devoid of air, through

the influence of radiation alone. In this case Dulong and Petit proved, by ex-

periment, that the velocity with which the bulb cools will be in every instance

accurately represented, if we suppose it to radiate heat at a rate depending

only on its own temperature, and to receive back heat at a rate depending only

on the temperature of the enclosure. Whatever evidence may be derived

from this research is therefore wholly in favour of the theory of exchanges.

The next step in the progress of this theory was one which led to a truer

conception of that law of which the law of sines may be considered an approxi-

mate expression, and was made by Provostaye and Desains. In a paper pub-

lished in the ' Annales de Chimie' for 1848, these authors prove experiment-

ally that which was theoretically recognized by Fourier, viz. that, when there

is reflexion, the law of the proportionality of the radiating power to the sine

of the angle which the ray makes with the surface becomes altered. In the

case of glass in a field of constant temperature, they show that the sum of

the reflected and radiated heat at all angles will be a constant quantity, and

equal to 93*9 per cent, of the lampblack radiation of that temperature, the

difference, viz. 6'1 per cent., being supposed to be due to diffusion. The idea

which pervades this paper is one which had previously been recognized by

Prevost and Fourier, but which proved particularly fertile when worked out

by Provostaye and Desains. It may be stated thus. Returning to our

hypothetical chamber of constant temperature, with a thermometer placed

inside of it, this instrument will give the same indication in whatever manner
we alter the substance of the walls, provided their temperature be left the
same ; whence we may infer that the sum of the radiated and reflected heat

from any given portion of the walls which strikes the thermometer, will be

Weindependent of the substance of which this portion is composed.  thus

perceive that it is not precisely correct to assert that the reflective power of a

body varies inversely as its radiative power, the proper statement being that,

in the case of constant temperature, the sum of the heat radiated and re-

flected by a body is a constant quantity.

But these authors were aware that something more than this was necessary

in order to ensure a complete equilibrium of temperature; they perceived that

the sum of the radiated and reflected heat from a body, while equal to the lamp-

black radiation, must also be unpolarized, even as the heat from lampblack is

unpolarized, in order that both streams under comparison may behave in the
same manner with respect to any surface on which they may happen to fall.

Since therefore the radiated and reflected heat taken together must be un-

polarized, and since the latter portion is at a certain angle polarized in the

plane of incidence | it follows that the former, or the radiated heat, must be

partly polarized in a plane perpendicular to that of emission. Experimen-
tally this is known to be the case. It had been previously shown by Arago

that the rays which leave solid and liquid incandescent bodies obliquely

are polarized in a plane perpendicular to that of emission, and Provostaye
and Desains found the same law to hold with regard to heat. Their ex-

periments are contained in the ' Annales de Chimie ' for 1849, their source of

heat being a plate of platinum maintained at a red heat by the flame of an

alcohol lamp.

  We thus perceive that at this stage of the inquiry a perfectly distinct con-

ception had been formed of the character, with respect to intensity and
polarization, of the heat emanating from the surface of a body in different
directions, necessary in order that the condition of equilibrium of tempe-

rature be fulfilled. No attempt, however, seems to have been made to split

up this body of heat into its constituent wave-lengths, with the view of ascer-
tainino- whether the same laws of equilibrium hold for each of these which

hold for the body of heat taken as a whole. Internal radiation, as a subject
for experiment, seems also to have been overlooked, and its essential con-
nexion with the theory of exchanges does not appear to have been recognized.

   In March 1858, I communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh the

results of an experimental research having reference to the two points just

mentioned. By means of a thermo-electric pile and galvanometer the fol-

lowing facts were established :

    1. The radiating power of thin polished plates of different substances was

found to vary as their absorptive power; so that the radiation of a plate of
rock-salt was only 15 per cent, of the total lampblack radiation for the same

temperature.

   2. It was shown that the radiation from thick plates of diathermanous
substance is greater than that from thin plates, no such difference being
manifested when the substances are athermanous.

   3. It was found that heat radiated by a thin diathermanous plate is less
transmissible through a screen of the same material as the heated plate than
ordinary or lampblack heat, this difference being very marked in the case of

rock-salt.

   4. Lastly, heat from a thick diathermanous plate is more easily transmitted
through a screen of the same nature as the source of heat than that from a

thin plate.

All these facts are easily explained by means of the theory of exchanges.

Let us recur to the hypothetical chamber before introduced, the sides of which

are covered with lampblack and kept at a constant temperature, and let us

hang up in this chamber two slices of polished rock-salt, of which the one is

twice as thick as the other ; these plates will ultimately attain the temperature

of the sides of the chamber, when their radiation will exactly equal their

absorption. Now, since the thick plate will absorb more than the thin one of

the heat which falls upon them from the walls, it will therefore also have a

greater radiation than the latter; as, however, both plates, being diathermanous,

absorb only a small portion of the heat which falls upon them, the radiation

Weof both will be comparatively small.  have thus an explanation of the

experimental fact that diathermanous bodies radiate very little heat, and that

Wetheir radiation increases with their thickness.  see also why in an ather-
--manous body an increase of thickness does not augment the radiation, the

reason being that, since it is already athermanous, this increase cannot pos-

sibly make it absorb more heat, and therefore cannot make it radiate more.

  We are therefore brought to recognize internal radiation as a consequence

of the theory of exchanges ; but the question now arises, Is the radiation of a

Aparticle independent of its distance from the surface ?  little reflection will

enable us to answer this question in the affirmative ; for it is evident (neg-

lecting the surface reflexion, which does not really alter the result arrived at)

that the amount of heat absorbed by two plates of any substance placed

loosely together is not different from that absorbed by a plate equal in thick-

ness to the two, and hence the radiation is the same also in both these cases.

I have likewise shown experimentally that the heat from two plates of rock-

salt placed the one behind the other, is the same as that from a single plate

equal iu thickness to the two.
ON THE THEORY OF EXCHANGES.                        101

Presuming therefore that the radiation of a particle is independent of its

distance from the surface, let us endeavour to realize what takes place in the

interior of a substance of indefinite thickness in all directions, and kept at a

constant temperature. Let us suppose that a stream of radiant heat is con-

A Nowstantly ilowing past a particle in the direction of the next particle B.

since the radiation of B is by hypothesis equal to that of A, the absorption

of B must be equal to that of A. But Itt us notice what has happened to

the stream of heat in passing A. Part of it has been absorbed by A, but on

the other hand it has been recruited by the radiation of A, and this being

Aequal to the absorption, the stream of heat when it has passed will be

found unaltered by its passage with regard to quantity. But it must also

remain unaltered with respect to quality, otherwise when it falls on B, the

Aamount absorbed by B will be different from that absorbed by ; and hence

Bthe radiation of will be different from that of A, which is contrary to

Ahypothesis. The absorption of is therefore equal to its radiation in quality

as well as in quantity ; or in other words, we have a separate equilibrium for

Weevery description of heat.  have thus an explanation of the experimental

fact already alluded to, that a body is particularly opake with regard to that

heat which it radiates, since we see that a substance is predisposed to radiate

that description of heat which it absorbs.

It is easy also to perceive why heat from a thick plate may be more easily

transmitted through a screen of the same nature as the source of heat, than

that from a thin plate, the reason being that the rays from the furthest por-

tion of the heated plate have already been sifted in their passage through the

plate, and hence that that portion of them which escapes is more easily able

to penetrate a screen of the same material.

I have before alluded to a conclusion derived by Provostaye and Desains

from the theory of exchanges, that in an enclosure of constant temperature

the sum of the radiated and reflected heat from any portion of the walls is

equal to the lampblack radiation of that temperature. This is a case which

evidently comes under the scope of the law, which provides for a separate

equilibrium for every description of heat ; hence we may assert that the sum

of the radiated and reflected heat is in this case equal to the lampblack radi-

ation in quality as well as in quantity ; and we are thus also led to perceive
why opake bodies heated up to the same temperature always radiate the same

description of heat.

  We come now to the subject of light ; and since radiant light and heat

have been shown by Melloni, Forbes, and others to possess very many pro-

perties in common, it was of course only natural to suppose that facts analo-

gous to those mentioned should hold also with regard to light. One instance

will at once occuff in which this analogy is perfect. For, as all opake bodies

heated up to the same temperature radiate the same description of heat, so

also when their common temperature is still further increased, they acquire

a red heat, or a yellow heat, or a white heat simultaneously.

   The idea of applying these views to light had occurred independently to

Professor Kirchhoft' and myself; but, although Kirchhoff slightly preceded

me in publication, it will be convenient to defer the mention of his researches

till I come to the subject of lines in the spectrum.

   In February 1860, I communicated to the Royal Society of London a
paper in which certain properties of radiant light were investigated, similar

to those already treated of with respect to heat.

   In this paper it was mentioned that the amount of light radiated by
coloured glasses is in propojtion to their depth of colour, transparent glass
giving out very little light; also that the radiation from red glass has a
greenish tint, while that from green glass has a reddish tint.
--102 REPORT 1861

   It was also mentioned that polished metal gives out less light than tar-
nished metal, and that, when a piece of black and white porcelain is heated

in the fire, the black parts give out much more light than the white, thereby

producing a curious reversal of the pattern.
   All these facts are comprehended in the statement that in a constant tem-

perature the absorption of a particle is equal to its radiation, and that for

every description of light.

It was also noticed that all coloured glasses ultimately lose their colour in

the fire as they approach in temperature the coals around them, the expla-

nation being, that while red glass, for instance, gives out a greenish light, it

passes red light from the coals behind it, while it absorbs the green, in such

a manner that the light which it radiates precisely makes up for that which it
absorbs, so that we have virtually a coal radiation coming partly from and

partly through the glass.

   In another paper communicated to the Royal Society in May of the same

year, it was shown that tourmaline, which absorbs in excess the ordinary ray
of light, also radiates, when heated, this description of light in excess, but that

when the heated tourmaline is viewed against an illuminated background of

the same temperature as itself this peculiarity disappears.
   It is now time to advert to the spectrum observations which have recently

excited so much attention, and which are intimately connected with the sub-
ject of this Report. Our countryman Wollaston*, and after him Fraunhofer,

were the first to show that in the solar spectrum numerous dark bands occur

which indicate the absence of light of certain definite refrangibility. Other

new bands were artificially produced by Sir David Brewsterf in his remark-
able experiment, in which the spectrum was made to pass through nitrous-

acid gas; and it was thus rendered probable that those which occur in tlie

solar spectrum are also in some way due to absorption. Professor W. H.

Miller of Cambridge, and the late Professor DaniellJ, extended this property

to chlorine, iodine, bromine, euchlorine, and indigo.

   When the spectra produced by the ignition of various substances were

examined by Sir D. Brewster§, Sir J. Herschel||, Messrs. Talbot^, Wheat-

stone**, W. A. Millerff, and others, their contrast to the solar spectrum

was exceedingly remarkable.

   While the latter may be described as a continuous spectrum intersected

with dark bands, the spectra of artificial substances are for the most part

made up of bright, discontinuous, highly characteristic bands of light in a
dark background, and their general appearance is that of the solar spectrum

reversed :}:$. I think Fraunhofer was the first to notice that a bright band

corresponding in refrangibility to the double dark band Dof the solar spectrum

was produced by the yellow light of a flame containing sodium ; and this ray

was shown by Professor W. A. Miller §§ to occur in the flames of lime,

strontia, baryta, zinc, iron, and platinum, while, according to Angstrom, it

was found in the electric flames of every metal examined by him. Professor

Swan                                       afterwards  showed  that  an  exceedingly  small  proportion  of common
                                    II II

salt called forth this line. All these philosophers, but particularly Angstrom,

seem to have been impressed with the idea that the same physical cause

which produces the dark bands of the solar spectrum, produces also the bright

bands in the spectra of incandescent bodies.

    In a paper by Angstrom* (a translation of which will be found in the

' Philosophical Magazine' for May 1855), the author refers to a conjecture

by Euler, that a body absorbs all the series of oscillations which it can itself
assume ; " and it follows from this, says Angstrom, that the same body when
heated so as to become luminous must emit the precise rays which at ordi-

nary temperatures are absorbed ;" after which remarkable conjecture, now
amply verified by experiment, he goes on to say, " I am therefore convinced

that the explanation of the dark lines in the solar spectrum embraces that of

the luminous lines in the electric spectrum."

   In connexion with this subject it may not be out of place to introduce the
following extract of a letter from Prof. W. Thomson to Prof. KirchhofF,

--dated 1860. Professor Thomson thus writes : " Professor Stokes mentioned

tor me at Cambridge some time ago, probably about ten years, that Professor
Miller had made an experiment testing to a very high degree of accuracy

Dthe agreement of the double dark line of the solar spectrum with the

double bright line constituting the spectrum of the spirit-lamp burning with

salt. I remarked that there must be some physical connexion between two

agencies presenting so marked a characteristic in common. He assented,

and said he believed a mechanical explanation of the cause was to be had

--on some such principles as the following : Vapour of sodium must possess

by its molecular structure a tendency to vibrate in the periods correspond-

ing to the degrees of refrangibility of the double line D. Hence the pre-

sence of sodium in a source of light must tend to originate light of that

quality. On the other hand, vapour of sodium in an atmosphere round a

source, must have a great tendency to retain in itself, i. e. to absorb and to

iiave its temperature raised by light from the source, of the precise quality

in question. In the atmosphere around the sun, therefore, there must be
present vapour of sodium, which, according to the mechanical explanation

thus suggested, being particularly opake for light of that quality, prevents

such of it as is emitted from the sun from penetrating to any considerable

distance through the surrounding atmosphere. The test of this theory must

be had in ascertaining vvliether or not vapour of sodium has the special

absorbing power anticipated. I liave the impression that some Frenchman
did make this out by experiment, but I can find no reference on the point."

   The experiment alluded to by Professor Stokes in this conversation was
made by M. Foucault, who in July 184'9 communicated to the Institute the
result of some observations on the voltaic arc formed between charcoal poles.

He found, to use his own words, that this arc, placed in the path of a beam

Dof solar light, absorbs the rays D, so that the dark line of the solar light is

considerably strengthened when the two spectra are exactly superposed.

DWhen, on the contrary, they jut out one beyond the other, the line appears

darker than usual in the solar light, and stands out bright in the electric
spectrum, which allows one easily to judge of their perfect coincidence.
Thus the arc, he continues, presents us with a medium which emits the rays

D on its own account, and which at the same time absorbs them when they

come from another quarter.
   To make the experiment in a manner still more decisive, Foucault pro-

jected on the arc the reflected image of one of the charcoal points, which,
like all solid bodies in ignition, give no lines ; and under these circumstances

Dthe line appeared as in the solar spectrum.

104 REPORT ISGl.

In October 1859, Professor Kirchhoff of Hcitlclberg matic a comiminica-

tion to the Berlin Academj' on tlie snbjpct of Frauiiliofer's liiirs, wliicli, along

with Foucault's communication, has been inserted by Professor Stokes in the
* Philosophical Magazine ' for March 1860. Professor Kirchhoft' thus de-

scribes the result of his experiments :

   " On the occasion of an examination of the spectra of coloured flames, not

yet published, conducted by Bunsen and myself in common, by which it has

become possible for us to recognize tiie qualitative composition of complicated

mixtures from the appearance of the spectrum of their blowpipe-flame, I

made some observations which disclose an unexpected explanation of the

origin of Fraunhofer's lines, and authorize conclusions therefrom respecting

the material constitution of the atmosphere of the sun, and perhaps also of

the brighter fixed stars.

    " Fraunhofer had remarked that in the spectrum of the flame of a candle

Dthere appear two bright lines, which coincide with the two dark lines of the

solar spectrum. The same bright lines are obtained of greater intensity from
a flame into which some common salt is put. I formed a solar spectrum by

projection, and allowed the solar rays concerned, before they fell on the slit,

to pass through a powerful salt-flame. If the sunlight were sufliciently re-

Dduced, there appeared in place of the two dark lines two bright lines ; if,

on the other hand, its intensity surpassed a certain limit, the two dark lines

D showed themselves in much greater distinctness than without the employ-

ment of the salt-flame.

" The spectrum of the Drummond light contains, as a general rule, the two

bright lines of sodium, if the luminous spot of the cylinder of lime has not

long been exposed to the white heat; if the cylinder remains unmoved these

lines become weaker, and finally vanish altogether. If they have vanished,

or only faintly appear, an alcohol flame into which salt has been put, and

which is placed between the cylinder of lime and the slit, (;auses two dark

lines of remarkable sharpness and fineness, which in that respect agree with

Dthe lines of the solar spectrum, to show themselves in their stead. Thus

Dthe lines  of the solar spectrum are artificially evoked in a spectrum in

which naturally they are not present.
    " If chloride of lithium is brought into the flame of Bunsen's gas-lamp, the

spectrum of the flame shows a very bright sharply defined line, which lies

midway between Fraunhofer's lines B and C. If, now, solar rays of moderate

intensity are allowed to fall through the flame on the slit, the line at the

place pointed out is seen bright on a darker ground ; but with greater strength
of sunlight there appears in its place a dark line, which has quite the same

character as Fraunhofer's lines. If the flame be taken away, the line disap-

pears, as far as I have been able to see, completely.
    " I concluded from these observations that coloured flames in the spectra of

which bright sharp lines present themselves, so weaken rays of the colour of
these lines, when such rays pass through the flames, that in place of the
bright lines dark ones appear as soon as there is brought behind the flame a
source of light of sufficient intensity, in the spectrum of which these lines
are otherwise wanting. I conclude further, that the dark lines of the solar
spectrum which are not evoked by the atmosphere of the earth, exist in
consequence of the presence, in the incandescent atmosphere of the sun, of
those substances which in the spectrum of a flame produce bright lines at
the same place

   <' The examination of the spectra of coloured flames has accordingly ac-
quired a new and high interest; I will carry it out in conjunction with Bunsen
as far as our means allow. In connexion therewith we will investigate the
ON THE THEORY OF EXCHANGES.                                           105

weakening of rays of light in flames that has been established by my observa-

tions. In the course of the experiments which have at present been instituted

by us in this direction, a fact has already shown itself which seems to us to

be of great importance. The Drummond light requires, in order that the

Dlines should come out in it dark, a salt-flame of lower temperature. The

flame of alcohol containing water is fitted for this, but the flame of Bunsen's

gas-lamp is not. With the latter the smallest mixture of common salt, as

soon as it makes itself generally perceptible, causes the bright lines of sodium

to show themselves."

   This interesting investigation, which was translated by Professor Stokes

in the 'Philosophical Magazine' for March 1850, came before me in time to
permit of my adding a supplement to a paper " On the Light radiated by

Heated Bodies," which has been already alluded to. In this supplement it

was attempted to explain tiie fact noticed by Kirchhoff', that the Drummond

Dlight requires, in order that the lines should come out in it dark, a salt-flame

of lower temperature. This is a phenomenon analogous to that presented
when a piece of ruby glass is heated in the fire. As long as the ruby glass

is of a lower temperature than the coals behind it, the light given out is of a

red description, because the ruby glass stops the green : the green light is

Dtherefore precisely analogous to the line wiiich is stopped by an alcohol

flame into which salt has been put. Should, however, the ruby glass be of a

much higher temperature than the coals behind it, the greenish light which

it radiates overpowers the red which it transmits, so that the light which

reaches the eye is more green than red. This is precisely analogous to what
is observed when a Bunsen's gas-flame with a little salt is placed before the

DDrummond light, when the line is no longer dark, but bright.

    Such was the explanation ; but in the meantime Professor Kirchhoff had not

been idle. Pondering on tiie circumstance that the Drummond light re-

Dquires a salt-flame of lower temperature, in order that the line should come

out in it dark, he was soon led to see the connexion between this fact and

the theory of exchanges. In a communication laid before the Berlin Academy
of Sciences on the 15th of December 1859, he had already recognized this con-

nexion, and in a subsequent communication to Poggendorff"s ' Annalen,' dated
January 1860, he shows it to be a mathematical consequence of the theory

of exchanges that a definite relation must subsist between the radiating and
absorbing power of bodies for individual descriptions of light and heat.

   This investigation proceeds upon the assumption that in an enclosure of
uniform temperature the distribution of radiant heat will remain unaltered, if
any one body be removed and another of a diflferent substance, but similar

dimensions, be substituted exactly in its place. The reasoning is somewhat

elaborate, but ultimately leads the author to a definite relation between the
radiating and absorbing powers of bodies for individual descriptions of light
and heat.

   He has expressed this relation very clearly in the following form.

  RLet denote the intensity of radiation of a particle for a given description
Aof light at a given temperature, and let denote the proportion of rays of

A--this description incident on the particle which it absorbs ; then  has the

same value for all bodies at the same temperature, that is to say, this quotient

is a function of the temperature only.

   Professor Kirchhoff" in this communication details some experiments which
he had made upon incandescent bodies. In confirmation of his assertion

that a body which remains perfectly transparent at the highest temperature

never becomes red-hot, he placed in a platinum ring of about 5 millims, dia.
--106 REl'ORT 1861.

meter a small portion of phosphate of soda, and heated it in the dull flame of

Bunsen's lamp. The salt melted, formed a fluid lens, and remained perfectly

transparent ; it, however, emitted no light, while the platinum ring with which

it was in contact glowed brilliantly. Kirchhoff" also showed that a plate of

tourmaline cut parallel to the axis which absorbs the ordinary rays in excess,

radiates the same in excess. These results are similar to those which I com-

municated shortly afterwards to the Royal Society, and which have been

already mentioned.

It was likewise stated by KirchhoS" in this paper, that Bunsen and he had

reversed the brighter lines of the spectra of potassium, calcium, strontium,

and barium, by exploding before the slit of the spectral instrument mixtures

of sugar of milk and chlorates of the respective metals during the passage of

the sun's ra3's.

Allusion has already been made to Kirchhoff"s application of this law of

reversal, in order to determine the constituents of the solar atmosphere. By

means of this principle he has been enabled, he believes, to trace the presence

of iron and other metals in the photosphere of our luminary, having found

that the bright lines whicii occur in the electric spectra of those metals cor-
respond in position with dark lines in tiie solar spectrum. " Iron," he says,

*' is remarkable on account of the number of the lines which it causes in

the solar spectrum. Less striking, but still quite distinctly visible, are tiie

dark solar lines coincident with the bright lines of chromium and nickel.

The occurrence of these substances in the sun may therefore be regarded as
certain. Many metals, however, appear to be absent ; for although silver,

copper, zinc, aluminium, cobalt, and antimony possess very characteristic

spectra, still these do not coincide with any (or at least with any distinct)

dark lines of the solar spectrum."

It has been shown, in the course of this Report, how the law which connects

together the radiating and absorbing power of bodies for individual descrip-

tions of heat or light follows immediately from the theory of exchanges.

But physicists have been anxious to establish this law as the result of some

simple fundamental property of matter. Euler, we have seen, and Angstrom

after him, predicted its existence, assuming as a fundamental principle, that

a body absorbs all the series of oscillations which it can itself assume.

   Professor Stokes also, in commenting on the discovery of Foucault and

--Kirchhoff" (Philosophical JVIagazine, March 1860), uses these words : " The

remarkable phenomenon discovered by Foucault, and rediscovered and ex-
tended by Kirchhoff, that a body may be at the same time a source of light

giving out rays of a definite refrangibility, and an absorbing medium ex-

tinguishing rays of the same refrangibility which traverse it, seems readily

Weto admit of a dynamical illustration borrowed from sound.  know that

a stretched string which on being struck gives out a certain note (suppose

its fundamental note) is capable of being thrown into the same state of vibra-

tion by aerial vibrations corresponding to the same note. Suppose now a
portion of space to contain a great number of such stretched strings, forming

thus the analogue of a 'medium.' It is evident that such a medium on

being agitated would give out the note above mentioned, while on the other

hand, if that note were sounded in air at a distance, the incident vibrations

would throw the strings into vibration, and consequently would themselves

be gradually extinguished, since otherwise there would be a creation ot vis

viva. The optical application of this illustration is too obvious to need com-

ment."

   Professor Tyndall also, in the Bakerian Lecture for this year, " On the

Absorption and Radiation of Heat by Gases and Vapours, and on the Physical
                                  ;

ON THE THEORY OF EXCHANGES.  10/

Connexion between Radiation, Absorption, and Conduction," has given a very
lucid statement of a hypothesis of tliis kind, accompanied with a remarkable

experimental verification.

   On the supposition that an ether envelopes the molecules of matter (just

as the air surrounds the string of a musical instrument), the author points out
tiiat the reciprocity of absorption and radiation is a necessary mechanical
consequence of this theory, on the principle of the equality of action and

reaction. He then goes on to say, " the elementary gases which have been

examined all exhibit extremely feeble powers, both of absorption and radia-
tion, in comparison with the compound ones. In the former case we have
oscillating atoms, in the latter oscillating systems of atoms. Uniting tlie
atomic theory with the conception of an ether, it follows that the compound
molecule, which furnishes points d'appui to the ether, must be capable of

accepting and generating motion in a far greater degree than the single atom,

which we may figure to our minds as an oscillating sphere. Thus oxygen and

hydrogen, which taken separately or mixed mechanically produce a scarcely
sensible eff"ect, when united chemically to form oscillating systems, as in
aqueous vapour, produce a powerful effect. Thus also nitrogen and hydrogen,
which when separate or mixed produce but little action, when combined
to form ammonia produce a great action. So also nitrogen and oxygen,
which, as air, are feeble absorbents and radiators, when united to form

oscillating systems, as in nitrous oxide, are very powerful in both capacities."

    This great absorbing power which belongs to a compound molecule is a
very interesting result, and seems to be well explained by this hypothesis ; but
M'hether all compound gases without exception are more absorptive than their

components, in the absence of experimental evidence may, I think, admit of

being questioned.

    It has been shown in this Report that internal radiation follows immediately
from the theory of exchanges, and is independent of the distance from the
surface. In an uncrystallized medium, this radiation will, by the principle

--of sufficient reason, be equal in all directions ; but here a question arises

which shapes itself thus : Let us suppose a polished surface of indefinite
extent, bounding an uncrystallized medium of indefinite thickness; and placed
opposite to this surface and parallel to it let us imagine an indefinitely ex-

tended surface of lampblack ; and finally, let the whole arrangement be ke\it

at a constant temperature. Now we know the quantity of heat which radiates

 from the lampblack in directions making different angles with the surface
 and since the proportion of this heat which after striking the polished surface
 penetrates it in a certain direction must be equal to the quantity of heat
 which leaves this surface from the interior in the same direction, it can be
 readily conceived how, by means of optical laws, we may be enabled to tell
 the internal radiation, in different directions, of the solid to which this surface
 belongs. It is remarkable that the internal radiation deduced by this method

--for an uncrystallized body is equal in all directions a result which we have

seen may also be arrived at by the principle of sufficient reason.

     In order to define internal radiation, let us conceive a square unit of sur-
 face to be placed in the midst of a solid of indefinite thickness on all sides,

 and consider the amount of radiant heat which passes across this square unit of

 surface in unit of time, in directions very nearly perpendicular to the surface,
 and comprehending an exceedingly small solid angle h<p. Call this heat Rt^,

 Rthen may be viewed as the intensity of the radiation in this direction.
   RNow if denote the radiation of lampblack, and /.i the index of refraction

 of an uncrystallized medium, it may be shown, that the internal radiation as

  thus defined is equal to R/:^^
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

 108 REPORT-- 1861.

     Before concluding this Report, tliere is one fiict which I think internal

 radiation may serve to explain in some such way as the following. Suppose
 we have two substances opposite one another, one having the temperature

 of 0", and the other of 100°, the latter will of course lose heat to the former

 let us call its velocity of cooling 100. Suppose now that, while the first

 surface still retains the temperature 0°, the second has acquired that of 400°
then we might naturally expect the velocity of cooling to be denoted by 400

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but by Dulong and Petit's law it is much greater. The reason of the increase

--may perhaps be thus accounted for : At the temperature of 100° we may

suppose that only the exterior row of particles of the body supplies the radia-
tion, the heat from the interior particles being all stopped by the exterior ones,
as the substance is very opake for heat of 100°; while at 400°, for the heat

of which the particles are less opake, we may imagine that part of the
radiation from the interior particles is allowed to pass, thereby sM'elling up
the total radiation to that which it is by Dulong and Petit's law.

On the Recent Progress and Present Condition of Manvfaduring
   Chemistry in the South Lancashire District. By Drs. E. Schunck,
   R. Angus Smith, und H. E. Roscoe.

It has been frequently suggested by persons engaged in manufacturing che-
mistry in this neighbourhood, that, as Manchester is the centre of a large
district in which the growth of those branches of industry immediatdy de-
pendent upon chemical science has been so extraordinarily rapid, and in

which their extent is now so vast, it would be fitting and desirable to pre-

sent to the Chemical Section of the British Association, at its Meeting in
Manchester, a short report on the recent progress and present condition of
the chemical manufactures of the South Lancashire district.

   In drawing up such u Report, those to whom the task of collecting and

editing the matter was entrusted have endeavoured, in the first place, to give
some idea of the progress which has been made in the trade, by describing
as concisely as possible those new processes, or those improvements on old
ones, in which any point of sufficient scientific interest presented itself; and
in the second place, to give a statistical account, as accurate as possible, of the
present yield of the very large number of chemical works in the South Lan-

cashire district. As a description of the rise of the Lancashire chemical
trade from its commencement would have much exceeded the limits of such a
Report, the authors decided upon confining themselves, as a rule, to the collec-
tion of facts regarding the improvements and new processes introduced du-

ring the last ten years. Notwithstanding this limitation it has, however, been

found that the labour of arranging the matter was much more considerable

than was at first supposed ; and the authors feel that, in spite of the great
amount of time and trouble they have expended upon it, the Report is still
far from complete, and they fear that in one or two minor points inaccuracies

may have crept in : they believe, however, that several points of great scien-

--tific interest will be presented to the notice of the Section points which

hitherto have only been known to the practical manufacturer; and they feel

sure that the statistics they have been able to collect will give to the scientific
world a notion of the importance, in a national point of view, of the chemical
trade of South Lancashire.

   The authors wish especially to remark that by far the largest portion of

the facts and statements which they are about to lay before the Section have
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

been verbally communicated to them by various gentlemen practically engaged
in the chemical manufactures of this neighbourhood, who have, in a most
liberal manner, not only opened their works to minute inspection, but have
themselves devoted a considerable amount of time and personal labour in
minutely explaining all those processes which they deemed of scientific in-
terest, thus throwing open their accumulated store of practical as well as

theoretical experience.

   Where the attention and interest shown by all the numerous gentlemen to
whom the authors had occasion to apply has been so great, it appears almost

invidious to mention any names; but in thanking all, the authors cannot for-
bear to state that to Messrs. Roberts, Dale and Co. of Cornbrook, Mr. Gos-
sage and Mr. Deacon of Widnes, Mr. Spence of Pendleton, Mr. Shanks of
St. Helens, and Mr. Higgin and Mr. Hart of Manchester they are especially
indebted for a large amount of valuable information.

   In conclusion, it may be stated that it has been the aim throughout the

Report to describe the various improvements effected during the last ten years
so far only as they are of scientific interest, and carefully to avoid entering
into those details of manufacture whicli to a great extent regulate the economic
production of the article, and which, though they are all-important to the

trader, are of slight interest to the man of science.

                                       I. Sulphuric Acid.

   No substance produced by the manufacturing chemist is equal in import-

ance to sulphuric acid, since it is quite indispensable in the production of

many other articles, as well as in many manufacturing processes. In the

production of soda-ash, and consequently of soap and glass, of muriatic,
nitric, and other acids, of alum, sulphate of copper, bleaching powder, &e.,

in bleaching and dyeing, its use is quite essential. To produce it econo-

mically on the large scale is therefore an object of considerable importance,
and numerous improvements have consequently been introduced into the
manufacture with the view of bringing it to the highest state of perfection.

In order to give an idea of the degree of economy practised, we may men-

tion that an eminent manufacturer informs us tiiat he obtains from 100 parts
of sulphur 280-290 parts of sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1-85, which, even sup-
posing the sulphur to be pure, is as near the calculated quantity (306) as can
be expected in practice. Very few manufacturers, however, employ sulphur

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

most of them use pyrites, the only objection to the latter being that it con-
tains arsenic, so that the product is consequently contaminated with arsenious
acid. The Irish pyrites contains 33 per cent, of sulphur, whilst the Spanish

pyrites contains as much as 46 per cent. The ordinary burner for pyrites is
well known, and answers sufficiently well when the ore is in large lumps,

since the quantity of sulphur left in the residue does not exceed 3 per cent.
but considerable difficulty is experienced in operating on the smaller pieces
and powder, technically called smalls. In burning these in the ordinary
way, in the case of Spanish pyrites, from 8 to 10 per cent, of sulphur remains

behind and is lost. By mixing them with clay and forming the mixture into
balls before burning, this loss may be reduced to about 4 per cent. It is

 indeed possible to continue the operation until the quantity of sulphur left

unconsumed amounts to only 2 per cent., but the time required for this pur-
pose is found to be too long to make it worth while to do so. Mr. Spence
 of Manchester has, however, devised a plan for effecting this object in an

--economical manner, which may be shortly described as follows : In the first

place the smalls are riddled out, the large lumps being put into the ordinary
110 REPORT 1861.

burner. The smalls are then placed on a hearth of firebrick 40 feet long

and 6 or 7 feet wide, which is heated from below, and has a current of air

passing over it to burn the sulphur and convey the sulphurous acid into the

chambers. The material 's introduced at the end furthest from the fire,
where it only experiences a gentle heat, and is gradually moved forward to

where the heat is greatest. If the ore is ground, the sulphur may in this

Wekiln be completely burnt.  may mention, by the way, that the introduc-

tion of Spanish and Portuguese pyrites has caused the rise of a new branch

of industry in the extraction of the small quantity of copper which these

ores contain. The manufacturers do not, however, find it advisable in gene-

ral to extract the copper themselves ; they sell it to the smelter.

   The manufacturers of oil of vitriol have recently availed themselves of

anotlier source of sulphurous acid. In Hill's process of purifying gas,

hydrated peroxide of iron is employed instead of lime. After being used for
some time the material is exposed to the atmosphere, in order to re-oxidize
the reduced oxide of iron. The process is repeated thirty or forty time?,

after which it can no longer be employed for the purification of gas. It
contains, however, 40 per cent, of sulphur, and the manufacturers make use
of it in the same way as pyrites for the production of sulphurous acid.

From 1 ton of the material they obtain about 1^ ton of hydrated sulphuric

acid.

Mr. Harrison Blair's improved sulphur-burner is especially valuable as

economizing space in the chambers, by preventing the sulphu'rous acid from

being diluted with too large an excess of air, as is the case with the ordinary

sulphur-burners. In this arrangement the sulphur falls into the burner

through a vertical hopper, air being admitted by an opening in front in suf-

ficient quantity to cause combustion of a portion of the sulphur, and by the

heat thus evolved to melt and volatilize the remainder. The vapour of the

sulphur is then supplied with a jet of air, from the side, carefully regulated,

and burns with a flame of great size. By means of this arrangement, one

chamber of a capacity of 25,000 cubic feet is stated to produce weekly

21 tons of rectified acid, whereas, by using the ordinary burner, a chamber of

the same capacity would produce only 11 tons.

   The tendency in this district has been to increase the size of the sulphuric-
acid-chambers. The largest that we have heard of has a capacity of 1 12,000

cubic feet.

   Many manufacturers employ Gay-Lussac's method, invented sixteen or

seventeen years ago for economizing nitric oxide. Pure sulphuric acid of
sp. gr. 1*75 is poured down a column filled with coke, so as completely to
moisten it. The waste nitrous fumes from the chambers, which would other-

wise be lost, are then passed through the column and absorbed. The liquid

is diluted with water to a sp. gr. of 1*50 and heated with steam, nitrous

fumes are evolved, which pass off into the chambers and are used instead of

fresh gas. By this means a saving of more than 50 per cent, of nitrate of

soda is effected. Others, however, do not employ this method, as they find

that with the present low price of nitrate of soda, £12 per ton, it does not

pay to collect and absorb the waste oxides of nitrogen.

The use of platinum stills for the rectification of sulphuric acid has

been almost entirely abandoned, and their place supplied by glass retorts,

which are now made much larger and of better quality than formerly. They

are placed either over the naked fire, or else in iron pots containing a little
sand ; and when carefully protected from currents of air, the breakage is not

found to be excessive. The acid thus obtained is said to be more transpa-

rent and less coloured than that prepared with platinum.

PROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY IN SOUTH LANCASHIRE. Ill

  Wc estimate the weekly production of sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1*85, in

this district, exclusive of that which is used in the manufacture of sodu-ash,
at about 700 tons.

                          II. The Manufacture of Soda.

    In the most important chemical manufacture of the district, that of soda-
ash, but few changes in principle have taken place during the last ten years,
the essential points of the original method of Leblanc (1797) being still
adhered to, although minor alterations have been introduced in the various

processes. The extent of the manufacture has, however, largely increased
since the year 1851. The value of alkali made annually in England is
estimated at two million pounds sterling ; of this, half is made in the South
Lancashire and half in the Newcastle district. In the year 1860 the average
quantity of common salt (chloride of sodium) decomposed per week in the
alkali works of the South Lancashire district amounted to 2600 tons. This
quantity of salt requires for its decomposition 3110 tons of sulphuric acid
of sp. gr. 1*60, and produces 3400 ions of hydrochloric acid of sp. gr. 1"15.
The weight of salt decomposed serves as the simplest measure of the activity
of the alkali trade, as this raw material is worked up into a variety of pro-

ducts the exact relative quantities of which it is not easy to estimate.
Through the kindness of the leading firms in the alkali trade in this neigh-
bourhood we are, however, enabled to lay before the Section a reliable

approximate estimate of the total quantities of these various products now
made in the district; viz. salt-cake, soda-ash, soda crystals, caustic soda, and

bicarbonate of soda :

Bicarbonate of soda sold per week
Caustic soda (solid) sold per week

     Since the year 1852 the alkali-trade in the South Lancashire district has

 more than tripled, in that year only 772 tons of common salt being con-

 sumed per week.

    These large quantities of products now manufactured are derived from about

 twenty-five works, varying from a yield of 175 to 25 tons of ash per week;
 the chief localities in which the trade is carried on are, St. Helens, Runcorn

 Gap, and Widnes Dock near Warrington, the neighbourhood of Bolton, and
 Newton Heath near Manchester*. Some idea may be formed of the extent
 of the Lancashire alkali-trade when it is stated that two large firms are

 engaged solely in breaking the limestone used by the alkali makers in the
 Widnes district alone.

    It would far exceed the limits of this Report were we even to mention the

I

' very numerous patents for improvements in the alkali-trade taken out since
 1851. Suffice it to say that none have succeeded in materially altering the

 process. Many plans have been proposed for avoiding the loss of sulphur,

the great drawback of Leblanc's original method ; but none have been as yet
found to be practicallysuccessful, if, indeed, we except a process used by the St.

Helens Patent Alkali Company, in which the bisulphide of iron (iron pyrites),
being roasted in a reverberatory furnace with common salt, yields volatile

sesquicliloride of iron, salt-cake, and peroxide of iron, which are sepax'ated

Aby lixiviation.   process, theoretically most promising, has been proposed by

Mr. Gossage, to whom the alkali-trade owes so much, by which all loss of

sulphur is avoided ; but even this plan has not yet been successfully worked.
It depends ujjon the following facts : (1) that moist carbonic acid decomposes
sulphide of sodium, forming carbonate of soda and sulphuretted hydrogen

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

--and (2) that dry peroxide of iron is reduced by sulphuretted hydrogen free
--sulphur, water, and protoxide of iron being formed, the latter part of the

process having been patented by Mr. Thomas Spencer in 1859. The salt-

cake, made in the usual way, is in this process reduced by coal, and the fused

sulphide allowed to flow through a tower filled with heated coke, in which it

meets a current of moist carbonic acid ; the carbonate of soda runs out at

the bottom of the tower, whilst the sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid

gases pass upwards through a tower tilled with peroxide of iron in porous

masses. The sulphur is there deposited upon the oxide of iron, and the mass

only needs burning in the ordinary pyrites-kilns to yield sulphurous acid

again. The numerous plans proposed for regaining the sulphur from the

alkali-waste have also all proved abortive ; nor indeed is this to be wondered

at when we consider the mechanical difficulties of dealing with a mass of

material amounting in some works to 600 tons weekly, and when we like-

wise remember that the waste contains only from 15 to 20 per cent, of sul-

phur, which, if it could all be easily extracted, Avould only make the mass

worth about 15*. per ton.

   The improvements of detail effected in the soda- manufacture since the

year 1851 have mainly been the following:

   (!) Greater attention to economical working in all the branches than was
formerly given, especially in the burning of pyrites, and in the evaporation
of the black-ash liquors, which is now wholly effected by the waste heat
from the black-ash furnaces. The arrangement for the evaporation of the

black-ash liquors by means of the spent heat of the black-ash furnaces was
proposed by Mr. Gamble of St. Helens, and by him liberally presented to

his co-manufacturers.

   (2) The process of lixiviation of the black ash is more completely accom-
plished than formerly by the employment of the very ingenious and simple

arrangement originally proposed by Mr. Shanks, and by him given to the

soda-trade. According to Mr. Shanks's method, all pumping of the liquors
or handling of the black ash is avoided, a much more perfect abstraction of

the soluble constituents is gained, and a great saving in expense of evapora-

tion is effected.

   (3) In some works the black ash is now made by machinery, under a
patent granted to Messrs. Elliot and Russell in 1853, and more recently
improved by Messrs. Stevenson and Williamson of the Yarrow Chemical

Works, Newcastle. In this method the mixture of salt-cake, coal, and lime-

stone is introduced into revolving iron cylinders, lined with firebricks, and

heated by a furnace, so that thus the process of manual stirring is avoided.

   (i) The soda-ash is now in many alkali-works packed into casks by

machinery.

Since the year 1851 an entirely new branch of the manufacture has been

introduced by the preparation of solid caustic soda, an article now largely

exported to America and other localities, to which carriage is expensive.
       PROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY IN SOUTH LANCASHIRE. 113

In the preparation of solid caustic soda advantage is taken of the facts, that

in all the black-ash liquors nearly one-third of the total alkali is present

as the hydrate, and that on concentrating these liquors by boiling, the whole

of the carbonate, and the greater part of the chloride, sulphate, and other

neutral salts separate, and may be removed by mechanical means, leaving

in solution the caustic alkali with a small quantity of sulphides and cyanides

<vhich are oxidized by nitrate of soda, as afterwards described. Sometimes,

however, it is found convenient to caustitize with linie the whole of the

black-ash liquor before evaporation : the caustic alkali must then be prepared

in a dilute solution ; otherwise, as is well known, a complete decomposition

does not occur. In order to utilize the heat wasted by the necessary evapo-

ration of the lye, Mr. Dale has patented a plan for boiling down the caustic

liquors iu closed iron boilers, employing the steam for motive power or for

heating purposes. . Mr. Dale finds that the liquors may be thus concentrated
to sp. gr. ISO without in any way injuring the boilers. When the lye has

obtained the above strength, it is concentrated in open iron pans, and nitrate

of soda is added to oxidize the sulphides and sulphites, large quantities of

ammonia being evolved. As soon as the greater portion of the uncombined

water has gone off, and the mass begins to undergo igneous fusion, the

--cyanides are decomposed by the nitrate nitrogen and oxygen gases being

liberated, and the carbon of the cyanogen appearing as a crust of finely

divided graphite. This interesting fact of the production of graphite by

decomposition, probably, of the cyanides, was first observed by Dr. Pauli of

the Union Alkali-works of St. Helens. The caustic soda thus prepared is

often perfectly white, although generally of a greenish colour from traces of
manganese; it contains neither iron noralumina, the former being precipitated

as an insoluble anhydrous peroxide, and the latter separating out as a crystal-

line alkaline silicate of alumina.

In concentrating the strong lye, the manufacturers were much troubled by

the continual boiling over of the fusing mass, but this has been remedied by

an ingenious application of the "Geyser" principle, also used in the kiers
employed in bleaching cotton goods, which we saw in operation at Messrs.

Gaskell and Deacon's Works at Widnes. At the bottom of the round pan

in which the evaporation is conducted is placed a conical pipe of sheet iron,

open at both ends, and reaching about an inch above the level of the fusing

mass. This tube does not rest close to the bottom of the pan, openings

being left for the entrance of the liquid. In contact with the heated iron,

steam is formed at the bottom of the tube, and the liquid is thus forced out

at the top of the tube, preventing altogether any violent ebullition occurring

in the other part of the pan, and consequently effectually stopping the boiling
over of the fused mass.

The proposition recently made by Kuhlmann for the employment of the

alkali-waste as a cement is not new, Mr. Deacon of Widnes having used this

waste material for making floors twelve years ago.
   The investigations of Mr. Gossage on the constitution of black ash have

been the base of a very important branch of that manufacture. This gentle-
man, so long ago as 1838, expressed his doubts as to the correctness of the

view taken by Dumas and other chemists concerning the composition of the

black ash, namely, that the separation of the soluble carbonate of soda from
the compounds of sulphur and lime by treatment with water depends upon

the formation of an insoluble oxysulphide of calcium. Mr. Gossage showed

that in all the liquors obtained by dissolving the black ash nearly one-third of

the total quantity of alkali is present as caustic soda, and that this closely

corresponds to the excess of caustic lime practically employed, whereas in

the dry substance no caustic soda can be dissolved out by alcohol. Hence
he concluded that the black ash consists of a mixture of carbonate of soda,
caustic lime, and monosulphide of calcium, and that when the mass is treated

with water, caustic soda and carbonate of lime are formed, the monosulphide
of calcium itself being insoluble in water. This theory of the composition

of black ash is now generally adopted by chemists practically engaged in
aliiali -making, and has received confirmation by the subsequent analyses of
Mr. F. Claudet and others.

   The growth of the soda-ash manufacture has been so rapid, and so many

changes have been caused by it in the chemical arts, that a short sketch of

its history may with great propriety be added to this portion of our subject

this sketch being in the main an abridgement of Mr. Gossage's paper read
before the Section. Previous to 1793, soda was made almost entirely from
the ashes of sea-weed obtained from Alicante, Sicily, Teneriffe, Scotland, and
Ireland. Potash from Russia, France, and America supplied its place to a
large extent ; now, however, soda supplies the place of potash, even in those

countries from which we formerly obtained potash. In ITOl a French Com-
mission decided that Leblanc's soda-ash process was the best proposed. The
Government made it known to the public in 1797. The inventor died in
poverty; but many manufacturers rose up in France and obtained great suc-
cess. It was little known in this country till 1823, when the duty of j630 a

ton was taken off salt.
    In connexion with soda, muriatic acid and chlorine must be named.

 Although Scheele, a Swede, discovered chlorine, Berthollet discovered its
 bleaching properties. The process was introduced into Scotland by Professor
 Copeland of Aberdeen; and in 1798 Mr. Charles Tennant of Glasgow
 patented a solution of chloride of lime as a bleaching-liquor, which was fol-

lowed up by the invention of the present bleaching-powder. When com-
mon salt is decomposed by sulphuric acid, the muriatic acid from which the

 chlorine is obtained is set free ; when this process was performed by bleachers
 the duty on the salt was remitted, but they were compelled to throw away all
 the sulphate of soda formed---a strange and most wasteful act. This con-
 tinued till ISl-i. About this time occurred the expiration of Tennant's patent
 for bleaching ; and crystals of carbonate of soda were gradually introduced at
 3630 per ton. Mr. Losh, of Newcastle, had made use of Leblanc's process
 almost from its publication, but on a small scale. In 1802 he sold soda-crystals
 at £60 per ton ; the present price is £i 10s. But in 1823 may be dated the
 commencement of the soda-ash manufacture in this country, when Mr. James
 Muspratt erected his works at Liverpool.

    The decomposition of the salt was made chiefly in open furnaces ; so that
 an enormous amount of muriatic acid was sent into the air, and soda-works
 were removed from towns when the Woulfe's apparatus was not used for con-
 densation. To remedy this loss, Mr. Gossage invented, in the year 1836, the
 coke tower as at present used. The acid gases percolate through a deep
 bed of coke, which fills a high tower, and which is supplied with water
 trickling through the porous material. Mr. Gossage and Mr. Shanks are said

 to have so purified the gas at Messrs. Crossfield's works at St. Helens, that it
 did not even render a solution of nitrate of silver turbid.

    In 1838, when the King of the Two Sicilies monopolized the trade in

 sulphur, it was raised in price from £5 to £14 per ton, when the Irish pyrites
 began to be used. This again led to the extraction of the copper from
 the spent pyrites, and also of the silver, a process commenced by Mr. Gos-
 sage in 1850. Mr. John Wilson began to extract the gold, but without com-

 mercial success.
                         ----

PROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY IN SOUTH LANCASHIRE.   11.5

    Since Mr. Muspratt began his works the price of soda has been reduced
60 per cent., although the raw materials have fallen only 10 per cent.

   There are about fifty soda-works in Great Britain ; and the following
amounts are made, as far as is known :

3000 tons of soda-ash per week.
2000 tons of soda-crystals per week.

 2,50 tons of bicarbonate of soda per week.
 400 tons of bleaching-powder per week.

    About 10,000 persons are employed in these operations, exclusive of those
engaged in procuring salt, coal, pyrites, and limestone, and in the transporta-

tion of the materials.

   The new French Treaty reduces the import duty into France 15 per cent.,
or 36*. per ton. At the time of making the Treaty, it was estimated that
59,000 tons of salt were used in France for soda, and 260,000 in Great

Britain.

   The following Table gives the amount of materials used at present for the
production of 1 ton of soda-ash, and their prices :

der and bleaching-liquor, both of which products are made in large quantities
in the district, 155 tons of bleaching-powder* being made each week.

   The only points in this manufacture which call for remark are :

   (1) An ingenious process for preparing chlorine without the use of

binoxide of manganese is used by Mr. Shanks of St. Helens. The process is

--as follows : Hydrochloric acid is added to chromate of lime, sesquichloride

of chromium and free chlorine are produced, and the free chlorine is used
for making bleaching-powder. Then lime is added to the sesquichloride of
chromium, and the precipitated sesquioxide reconverted into chromate by

heating with lime in a reverberatory furnace.

   (2) The regeneration of peroxide of manganese from the waste liquors
containing chloride of manganese has, as is well known, been performed with
success by Mr. Charles Dunlop, so much so that the product obtained is
almost pure. Dr. Gerland of Newton-le-Willows has communicated to us the

following process for recovering from these liquors not only peroxide of

manganese, but also the nickel and cobalt which they contain. The liquors

are first neutralized with limestone, and then caustic lime is added until all

the iron is precipitated as hydrated peroxide of iron. The precipitate, after
washing and drying, may be used as yellow ochre. The filtrate contains
manganese, nickel, and cobalt. The two latter metals are precipitated as
sulphides by means of a solution of sulphide of calcium (obtained from black-

ash waste), which is added until the precipitate ceases to be of a pure black.

The precipitate is now collected and subjected to the well-known manipula-
tions for separating the metals. The supernatant liquid is siphoned ofl", and
the manganese contained in it is precipitated as hydrated protoxide by adding
milk of lime. The oxide is washed by decantation and thrown on calico for
draining. It is converted into the higher oxide simply by the agency of
heat and air, and is generally obtained as a fine black powder containing
70 per cent, of peroxide. The average quantity of cobalt contained in 1 ton

of manganese is 10 lbs., and of nickel 5 lbs.

                              IV. Chlorate of Potash.

   From 4 to 5 tons of this salt are manufactured weekly in this district.
It is employed for making matches, and also as an oxidizing agent in steam

colours on calico.

                                V. Hyposulphite of Soda.

    This salt is manufactured by Messrs. Roberts, Dale and Co., to the extent
of 3 tons weekly. It is prepared by passing sulphurous acid through a solu-
tion of sulphide of sodium, and purified by recrystallization. It is used by
paper-makers, by photographers, and by bleachers (known as antichlor).

                                       VI. Silicate of Soda.

   The experiments of Fuchs, Kuhlmann, and others have shown that the
alkaline silicates may be employed with success for the purpose of coating
building-stones of a soft or porous nature, thus enabling them to resist
the action both of air and water. Another use has been found for them
in this district, viz. as a substitute for cow-dung in calico-printing ; and they

are also extensively employed by soap-manufacturers in place of the resinates.

Silicate of soda is the compound employed. The process of manufacture is
simple. Sand and carbonate of soda are melted together, a sufficient quan-

   * Of this quantity 70 tons are produced at St. Helens, 40 at Runcorn and Runcorn Gap,
and 45 in Flint.
           PROGRESS OP CHEMISTRY IN SOUTH LANCASHIRE. 117

 tity of the latter being taken to prevent the watery solution afterwards gela-

tinizing. The product has the appearance of glass, transparent in thin
layers, and variously coloured in mass, from pale yellow to brown or black,
the colour being due to the presence of carbon. Occasionally it is of a pale
green. As it is difficult to reduce it into fragments by pounding, on account

of its extreme brittleness, it is found advantageous to allow the fused mass
to run directly into water, by which means it is immediately broken up into
pieces of a convenient size. About 10 tons per week are produced in this
neighbourhood.

                                 VII. Arseniate of Soda.

    This salt has of late come into very general use as a substitute for cow-
dung in calico-printing, for which purpose it is much better adapted than

the phosphate or silicate of soda, as it does not attack the alumina mordants
to so great an extent as those salts. It is generally prepared by fusing
arsenious acid with nitrate of soda and caustic soda. Without the addition
of caustic soda, an acid arseniate would be formed. In this way, however,
a considerable loss of arsenious acid takes place. Mr. Higgin, of this city,
has therefore invented and patented a process, by which this loss is prevented.

He dissolves the arsenious acid in caustic soda, adds nitrate of soda, introduces

the mixture into a reverberatory furnace, and allows the heat of the fire to
pass over the surface. In the first instance ammonia is given off, then nitric
oxide. The heating is continued until the paste is perfectly dry. This pro-
cess is attended by a saving, not only of arsenious acid, but also of nitrate
of soda. The advantages attending the use of arseniate of soda for dung-
ing are, that a greater proportion of the mordants becomes fixed, and that
the colours are superior and the whites purer after dyeing than with other
materials. Its use is also attended with greater economy. It is to be re-
gretted that so valuable a substance as this should also be one of so highly
poisonous a nature.

   The quantity produced in this district amounts to 10 or 12 tons per week.

                            VIII. Bichromate of Potash.

  We have nothing new to report regarding the manufacture of this salt.

About 14 tons are produced weekly in our district.

                                 IX. Prussiates of Potash.

   From 4 to 5 tons of yellow prussiate of potash and 1 ton of red prussiate

are produced in this district per week.

                              X. Superphosphate of Lime.

   Weekly production in this district, 500 to 600 tons.

                          XL Sulphate of Baryta.

   Of this salt, which is usually sold under the name of " blanc fixe," about
2 tons are made in this district by precipitation. The plan pursued is very

simple : Derbyshire heavy spar is heated with carbon, the sulphide of
barium thus obtained is decomposed with muriatic acid, and from the solution

the baryta is precipitated as sulphate. When prepared in this manner, it is

found to be better adapted for the purpose to which it is applied than the ore
simply ground, as it possesses more body as a paint than the latter.

                                     XII. Epsom Salts.

   Weekly production in this district, 20 tons.
--118 REPORT 1861.

                                          XIII. Alum.

   One of the most important improvements introduced into our chemical
manufactures during the last twenty years is the new process of making

alum, first patented by INIr. Spence in IS^S, and carried out on a large scale
by Messrs. Spence and Dickson since 1847. Before that time the alum
manufactured in this district was confined to a small quantity made from

pipeclay, our chief supplies being derived from Whitby. By the old process,
60 tons of the oolitic shale of Yorkshire were required in order to produce
1 ton of potash alum and 1 ton of Epsom salts. By Mr. Spence's process
50 tons of shale yield 65 tons of ammonia-alum. Mr. Spence employs the

shale found underlying the seams of coal in this district. This shale, which
is black from the organic matter contained in it, is piled up in heaps about
4- or 5 feet high, and slowly calcined at a heat approaching to redness. Before
calcination the alumina of the shale will not dissolve in sulphuric acid ; and,
on the other hand, if the heat be raised too high, so as to induce a partial
vitrification of the clay, the alumina is again rendered quite insoluble in acid.

The calcination lasts ten days, the heaps being supplied daily with fresh shale.

When suflficiently calcined, the material is soft and porous, and of a pale brick-

red colour. The calcined shale is then placed in covered pans, each capable
of holding 20 tons of the material, and is there digested from thirty-six to
forty-eight hours with sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1'35. The liquid is kept at

a temperature of 230° Fahr., partly by fire underneath the pans, and partly
by the introduction of vapour from a boiler containing gas-liquor. This
part of the process was patented by Mr. Spence in 1858-59, it having been
found unnecessary to treat first with acid and then with alkali, the com-
bined treatment answering quite as well, provided there is an excess of acid

present. The volatile ammonia-salts of the gas-liquor pass over into the pans
and are decomposed by the acid ; the ammonia of the remainder is liberated
by the addition of lime. The liquor is now run off into cisterns, and kept
continually agitated while it cools, in order to promote the formation of
small crystals. The crystals are allowed to drain, and washed with the

liquor which runs off from the blocks of alum. No iron is found in the

crystals, though there is an abundance in the mother-liquor in the shape

of persulphate of iron. To this succeeds the so-called Hoching process,
which simply consists in rapidly recrystallizing. This is effected by Mr.
Spence through the agency of steam, without the addition of water. The
crystals are thrown into a hopper, at the bottom of which they come into

contact with a current of steam, which dissolves them rapidly, fresh crystals
being successively added in quantities sufficient to prevent the escape of the

steam. By this means 4 tons of crjstals may be dissolved in one half to three
quarters of an hour. The solution runs immediately into a leaden tank,

where it is allowed to settle for three hours, and deposits a quantity of matter
insoluble both in water and acid, supposed to be a compound consisting of, or
containing subsulphate of alumina. The clear liquor is now allowed to run
into tubs, the bottoms of which are formed of Yorkshire flags each 6 feet in
diameter, and the sides of moveable staves 6 feet long, which are kept in their
places by hoops and screws. After standing from five to eight days, the
hoops are unscrewed and the staves removed, when a mass of crystallized
alum of the form of the tub appears. After standing eight days longer, a
hole is made at 8-10 inches from the bottom, and a quantity of liquor runs
out. The mass is generally 18 inches thick at the bottom, and 1 foot at the
sides, and contains 3 tons of marketable alum, while the liquor contains 1 ton,
which goes back to the pans.
       PROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY IN SOUTH LANCASHIRE. 119

   In 1850-51, Mr. Spence made about 20 tons of alum per week. The
quantity now made by him amounts to 110 tons, of which 70 tons are pro-

duced in this district. Fully half of the total quantity manufactured in
England (300 tons per week) is made by his process.

                 XIV. Protosulphate of Iron.     '

This salt is manufactured in large quantities in this district, principally for

the use of dyers, the amount being about 80 tons per week. The process of

--manufacture pursued here is as follows : Iron pyrites, derived from the coal-

measures, and commonly called here coal brasses, is piled up in heaps,

Awatered and exposed to the atmosphere.   process of slow oxidation takes

place. Sulphate of iron with an excess of sulphuric acid is formed. The

latter is removed by means of scrap iron. The salt is obtained by evapora-

Antion of the liquor, and is tolerably pure.     inferior quality is procured

from the mother-liquor, which contains alumina.

                 XV. Compounds of Tin.

--Chlorides of Tiji. The quantity of these compounds (estimated as crystal-

lized protochloride of tin) manufactured in this district amounts to about

I65 tons per week.

 --Stannate of Soda. This compound has for some time been extensively

used for the purpose of preparing calicoes which are intended to be printed

with so-called steam colours. It is usually obtained by fusing metallic tin

or finely powdered tin ore with nitrate of soda. It has been found that the

addition of 5 per cent, of arseniate of soda causes a saving in tin, by render-

ing, as it seems, the oxide of tin less soluble in the sulphuric acid, through

which the goods are subsequently passed.

Stannate of soda is also prepared from scrap tin by Mr. Higgin's process.

Various attempts, with more or less success, have been made at various times

to separate the tin and the iron of scrap tin, or waste tinned iron, and so

utilize the former metal. Mr. Higgin acts on the scrap with a mixture of

muriatic acid and a little nitrate of soda. When muriatic acid is used

alone, the iron diissolves more rapidly than the tin, but when nitrate of soda

is added, the tin is acted on in preference. The whole of the nitrate of soda

disappears, and the resulting products are bichloride of tin, chloride of
ammonium, and chloride of sodium, in accordance with the following equa-

tion:

       4Sn+10ClH + NaNOe=4.SnCl,-fNH,Cl-fNaCl + 6HO.

The bichloride of tin is then converted, by the excess of tin present, into

Aprotochloride.  little iron dissolves at the same time and is separated by

means of chalk, which precipitates the protoxide of tin, leaving the iron in

solution. The former is then converted, by fusion with nitrate of soda and

caustic soda, into stannate of soda, with evolution of ammonia. The iron

stripped of the tin is employed for the precipitation of copper.

                                      XVI. Copper Ores.

   Mr. William Henderson has introduced into this district a mode of dealing
with very weak copper ores, which has been found extremely successful at

Alderley, where the sandstone contains only \\ per cent, of copper, in the

form of carbonate and arseniate. The sand containing the copper is put
into wooden vats with muriatic acid, and fresh sand added until the amount
of copper is sufficient for saturation. The solution is then drawn off, and the
copper precipitated by waste or scrap iron. In this way ores otherwise use-
less have become valuable.
                                                          :

--120 REPORT 1861.

   Another mode of attaining this object, and one in many cases to be pre-
ferred, is by using sulphuric acid and boiling down the solution of sulphate

of copper so as to obtain crystals, or still further, viz. to dryness. This is
then heated in a furnace having a plate, or floor, of brickwork or tiles, the
fire being applied beneath, and not passing over the salt of copper : the
sulphate is decomposed, and sulphuric acid passes off. But the decomposi-

tion is more effectual when carbon is added ; in this way sulphurous acid is
driven off, and it is then led into a chamber, and being treated with nitrous

fumes in the usual way, sulphuric acid is formed, which is again used for the
solution of the copper in the ore. If the ore contains suboxide of copper, it
is previously roasted for oxidation. Phosphates, arseniates, carbonates, and

oxides may be treated by this process.
   For sulphides of copper Mr. Henderson roasts with common salt, having

previously reduced the ore to fine powder. The chloride of copper is vola-
tilized and condensed in a Gossage coke tower. The sulphate of soda re-
maining may be washed out of the non-volatile portion, and the copper pre-

cipitated from the solution flowing from the tower. He separates by this

means the metals whose chlorides have a different rate of volatilization
chlorides such as chloride of silver are obtained in the flue close to the fur-

nace.

  We do not allude to the other inventions contained in Mr. Henderson's

patents, as we are not aware of any being in use in this district.

          XVII. Nitric Acid.

   About 48 tons of nitrate of soda per week are used in this district for
making nitric acid. The salt yields its own weight of acid of sp. gr. ] -40.

Nitric acid is used here for making the nitrates of copper, lead, alumina,
and iron, for oxidizing tin, for etching, and also for making aniline from

benzole.

          XVIII. Oxalic Acid.

    One of the most important and most interesting of the new manufacturing
processes which we have to describe in this Report is one for the preparation

of oxalic acid, invented and patented by Messrs. Roberts, Dale and Co.,

gentlemen to whom we owe a number of highly ingenious and useful prac-

tical processes. The method of preparing oxalic acid hitherto employed
consists, as is well known, in acting on organic substances, such as sugar or
starch, with nitric acid. This process has now been superseded by that of
Messrs. Roberts, Dale and Co., which depends on the action exerted by
caustic alkalies on various organic substances at a high temperature. That
oxalic acid is one of the products formed by this action is a fact well known

to chemists, but one that has not until recently been turned to any practical
use. In the year 1829, Gay-Lussac published a short memoir*, in which
he announced that he had succeeded in obtaining oxalic acid by heating
cotton, sawdust, sugar, starch, gum, tartaric acid, and other organic acids

with caustic potash in a platinum crucible. Since that time the subject
has not been attended to either by scientific chemists or by practical men, so

far as we know. Messrs. Roberts, Dale and Co. are, we believe, the first
persons who have succeeded in carrying out the process in practice on a
large scale. In their attempt to do so they were met by a number of

serious obstacles, chiefly of a practical nature. These, however, they have,

by dint of uncommon ingenuity, and by the application of an amount of
perseverance of which, perhaps, but few men are capable, succeeded in

          * Annales de Chim. et de Phys. t. xli. p. 398.
PROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY IN SOUTH LANCASHIRE. 121

overcoming, and the process is now in full and successful operation at their
works at Warrington. With a most praiseworthy liberality, these gentlemen
have furnished us with full particulars regarding their process. They have
also allowed us to see it in operation, and we are therefore able to lay before
the Section all the details necessary for becoming acquainted with its prin-

cipal features.

   The only practical suggestion contained in Gay-Lussac's memoir, consists
in his proposal to convert cream of tartar by this method into oxalate of pot-
ash. At that time tartaric acid was cheaper than oxalic acid, and the sug-
gestion might therefore, under the circumstances of the time, have proved of

some practical value. It was evident, however, that for the purpose of ensu-
ring success a cheaper material had to be chosen. Messrs. Roberts, Dale
and Co. found woody fibre in the shape of sawdust to answer perfectly. Gay-
Lussac states, as the result of his experiments, that potash may be replaced
by caustic soda. Mr. Dale found, however, that woody fibre produces hardly

any oxalic acid with caustic soda. On the other hand, when potash is used

alone, the process is not remunerative. This difficulty was overcome by em-

ploying a mixture of soda and potash, in the proportion of two equivalents of

the former to one of the latter, which produces the desired effect quite as well
as potash alone. In what manner the soda acts in this case can only be con-

jectured : whether in conjunction with the potash it takes the place of the

latter, or whether it merely promotes the fusibility of the mixture, is merely a

matter for speculation. The solution of the mixed alkalies having been

evaporated to about 1*35 sp. gr., sawdust is introduced, so as to form a thick

paste. This paste is then placed on iron plates in thin layers and gradually

heated, the mass being kept constantly stirred. During the heating-process,
water is in the first instance given off. The mass then swells up and disen-

gages a quantity of inflammable gas, consisting of hydrogen and carburetted

Ahydrogen.  peculiar aromatic odour is at the same time evolved. After

the temperature has been maintained at 400° Fahr. for one or two hours,

this part of the process may be considered as complete. The whole of
the woody fibre is now decomposed, and the mass, which has a dark-

brown colour, is entirely soluble in water. It contains, however, only from

1^ per cent, of oxalic acid, and about 0*5 per cent, of formic, but no acetic

acid. What the nature of the principal product intermediate between the
woody fibre and the oxalic acid is has not yet been determined ; it seems
well worthy of further investigation. The mass is now exposed still longer

to the same temperature, care being taken to avoid any charring, which

would cause a loss of oxalic acid. When perfectly dry, it contains the

+maximum quantity of oxalic acid, viz. from 28-30 per cent. (C^ O3 3 HO),

but still no acetic acid, and very little more formic acid than before. The

absence of acetic acid is surprising, as it is generally supposed to be an

essential product of this process of decomposition. It is possible that the

acetates may be converted into oxalates as they are formed ; but, on the other
hand Gay-Lussac states that acetates when heated with caustic alkalies yield

--chiefly carbonates, and but a trifling proportion of oxalates a conclusion to

which Mr. Dale has also been led from direct experiments with acetates*.

    The product of the heating-process, which is a grey powder, is in the next

place treated with water heated to about 60° Fahr. In this the whole dissolves,

with the exception of the oxalate of soda which is either contained in it, or
is formed by double decomposition on the addition of water, and which, on
account of its slight degree of solubility, falls to the bottom. The use of the

  * It may be mentioned that the process of decomposition takes place equally well in close

vessels. It must therefore be accompanied by a decomposition of water.
                           --

122 REPORT 1861.

soda in this part of the process is sufficiently apparent. The supernatant
liquid is drawn off and evaporated to dryness, and the residual mass is heated
in furnaces in order to destroy the organic matter and recover the alkalies
which it contains, and which are employed again after being causticized for

acting on fresh sawdust. In consequence of the elimination of soda, the
relative proportion of the two alkalies recovered from the liquor is, of course,
different to what it was at the commencement; and before being used again
the quantity of each alkali contained in the mixture must be ascertained.

   The oxalate of soda, after being washed, is decomposed by boiling with

hydrate of lime. Oxalate of lime falls to the bottom, and caustic soda passes

into solution, and may be employed again for any purpose to which it is ap-
plicable. The resulting oxalate of lime is decomposed by means of sulphuric

acid, the proportions employed being three equivalents of acid to one of the
oxalate ; and the liquor decanted from the sulphate of lime is evaporated to
crystallization in leaden vessels. The crystals of oxalic acid, which are slightly
coloured by organic matter, are purified by recrystallization.

   From about 2 lbs. of sawdust 1 lb. of crystallized oxalic acid may be
obtained. There is no loss of oxalic acid. The only loss experienced is in
alkalies. The quantity of acid at present manufactured by Messrs. Roberts,

Dale and Co. amounts to 9 tons per week ; and their works are capable of
being extended so as to produce 15 tons, which is supposed to be the total
quantity consumed throughout the world. Their plant is extensive and
costly, and bears evidence of an uncommon spirit of enterprise on the part

of the proprietors.
    In order to give an idea of the effect which the introduction of this pro-

cess has had on the market, it may be mentioned that the selling price of the

aeid at this time is 8c?. to 9c?. per lb., whereas in 1851 it was 15d. to 16c?.
per lb.

    Oxalic acid is used extensively in calico-printing, woollen-dyeing, woollen-

printing, silk-dyeing with wood colours, in straw-bleaching, and for making

binoxalate of potash, the so-called "salt of lemons."

                                 XIX. Pyroligneous Acid.

   The only improvement introduced into the manufacture of this acid during
the last few years consists in the use of sawdust instead of wood in the
process of destructive distillation. The sawdust is introduced into the front
of the retort through a hopper, and is gradually moved to the other end by
means of an endless screw, worked by machinery. During its transit it
becomes completely carbonized, the gaseous and liquid products escape

through a pipe, while the charcoal is allowed to fall into a vessel of water.

The latter precaution is necessary, since the carbon is obtained in such a

minute state of division that no cooling in the air or in closed vessels would
be sufficient to stop the combustion. In other respects the process does

not differ essentially from that with wood. No more acid is obtained than

with wood, and less naphtha. The quantity of the former varies, however,
with the temperature employed. The usual temperature is that of a dull red
heat. From 1 ton of sawdust 100-120 gallons of liquid, containing 4 per
cent, of glacial acid and 15 gallons of tar, are obtained, and 100 parts of
the crude distillate yield 3 of naphtha. The advantage consists in the

cheapness of the material employed ; but, on the other hand, one of
the resulting products, viz. the finely divided charcoal, is comparatively

worthless.

   This invention forms the subject of Mr. Halliday's patent, which was taken
out in the year 184'8-4'9. Quite recently Mr. Bowers has patented another
           PROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY IN SOUTH LANCASHIRE. 123

plan, which consists in passing the sawdust into the retorts by means of an
inclined plane, and a series of scrapers.

 --Quantity of acid manufactured weekly in Manchester: 12,000 gallons,

containing about 4 per cent, of glacial acid.

   The value of the acid is £3 per ton, whilst that of the tar is from £4< to

£4^ 10s.

   The quantities of red liquor (acetate of alumina) and iron liquor (prot-
acetate of iron) made may be stated here, as they are always made by means
of pyroligneous acid, and generally by the same parties who manufacture the
acid. Red liquor, 12,000 gallons. Iron liquor, 6000 gallons.

                       XX. Starch and Artificial Gums.

   About 20 tons of starch and 34 tons of gum-substitutes, made by roasting

farina and other kinds of starch, are produced in this district per week.

   No change has taken place in the process of manufacturing starch from
flour. The old process of fermentation is still adhered to.

                              XXI. Purification of Kesin.

   Several very interesting and successful processes have lately been patented

by Messrs. Hunt and Pochin of Salford, for the purification of resin. The
aim of these gentlemen, who have devoted a large amount of time and atten-

tion to this subject, is to produce a bright, nearly colourless, solid and brittle

resin from the common dark and impure commercial article. This end

they attain by distilling the resin in an atmosphere of steam at about 10 lbs.

pressure. The several resinous acids which on distillation by themselves
split up into gaseous products and volatile oils of very variable composition,
are mechanically carried over, it would appear, in presence of steam, as is
well known to be the case with stearic and the other higher fatty acids ; and

a solid product, which cannot be distinguished from the finest resin, is
obtained from a very impure material. In their patent of 1858, Messrs.

y resin. These three several substances present the characteristics of resins,
but clarified and to a great extent deprived of colour. They are either
separately or in combination applicable to and useful in the manufacture of

several important articles, such as soap, size, candles, paper-size, varnish,

and japan ; and they may be used for distilling to produce resin-oils.
   About 60 tons per week of this purified resin are now manufactured in

this district under this patent.

                      XXII. Organic Colouring-Matters.

   There are few substances of more importance to the manufacturers of this
district than those which are employed in imparting colour to the various
fabrics, especially those of cotton, produced here. Of these substances the
majority are derived from the animal or vegetable kingdom. Indeed, with
the exception of oxide of iron and chromate of lead, very few mineral sub-
stances are at the present time made use of alone by the dyer or printer.
The greater intensity, beauty, and variety of the dyes which are wholly or
in part composed of organic matters causes them to be preferred ; and the
increase of skill and knowledge of scientific principles on the part of dyers

and printers has also led to their more exclusive employment. When it

is stated that the quantity of dye-woods (logwood, peachwood, sapanwood,
barwood, fustic, quercitron bark) consumed weekly by the dyers of this
124 REPORT 1861.

district amounts to 300 or 400 tons, that the weekly consumption of the
same by printers is about 60 tons, that from 150 to 200 tons are in the same
time converted into extracts, and that 150 tons per week of madder are
used up, exclusive of what is used for garancine, &c., some idea of the mag-

nitude of the interests depending on tlie employment of these materials may

be formed.

   The chemistry of colouring-matters is still in its infancy. Indeed, so few
of them have as yet been prepared in a state of purity, that we have hitherto
been able merely to lay down a few general principles applicable to ail. The

direct applications of science in this branch of the arts are therefore few.

The purely practical improvements which have been introduced in dyeing
and printing within the last twenty years are, however, numerous and im-

portant. Among these may be mentioned the invention of steam colours,

which certainly dates from an earlier period, but has of late years received a

--much more extensive application the improved methods of preparing extracts
--of dye-woods the fixation of insoluble pigments on fabrics by means of

--albumen the introduction of artificial colouring matters, such as murexide,

and the various colours from aniline.
   In the present Report we must, however, confine ourselves to the improve-

ments which have been made in the preparation of the materials used for the

purpose of dyeing, without entering into the subject of the dyeing-processes

themselves.

   No dyeing-material has received so much attention, both on the part of
scientific chemists and of practical men, as indigo. The chemical properties

of its most important constituent have been fully investigated, and its beha-
viour when applied in practice carefully examined. It is perhaps on this
very account that we find nothing of importance to report under this head.
With the exception of a new method of reducing indigo by means of finely

divided metals, patented by Leonard, we do not suppose that any important

improvement has been introduced in connexion with this dye-stuff.

   Of no less importance in the art of dyeing is madder, the material with
which the most permanent reds, purples, and blacks are produced. The
methods which have been proposed for more effectually utilizing this impor-
tant dye-stuff are very numerous indeed, though exceedingly few of them
have been found to be of practical value. They may be divided into two

classes, viz., those having for their object to render available the greatest
amount of colouring-matter, and those which tend to produce more perma-

nent or more beautiful colours. The first object seems to be perfectly
attained by converting the madder by the action of acid into garancine.
This preparation is becoming more and more extensively used. There are
printing-establishments in which nothing else is employed in the production
of madder colours. Even in turkey-red dyeing it is beginning to be much

used, thus proving the fallacy of the opinion formerly entertained, that no
preparation of madder could be made to supply the place of the crude mate-
rial in this process. The garancine for this purpose is manufactured in
Holland. It is said to be made by treating the roots with dilute sulphuric
acid containing 35 per cent, of the weight of the madder of concentrated
acid (the usual proportion in this country being .about 25 per cent.), and

boiling for several hours. By this means the pectic acid, one of the most
hurtful constituents of the root, is removed. The residue left after the ordi-
nary process of madder dyeing still contains a quantity of colouring-matter
in a state of combination. By treating it with sulphuric acid a product is
obtained called garanceux, which is again used for dyeing. The quantity of

garancine manufactured in this district, exclusive of garanceux (which is
PROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY TN SOUTH LANCASHIRE. 125

mostly made and consumed by printers themselves), is estimated at about
1200 tons per annum, which would require about three times its weight of

madder for its production.

   Of the second class of inventions bearing on madder, perhaps the most

successful is that which was patented by Pincoffs and Schunck in the year
1853. It is well known that in order to produce the finer descriptions of
madder colours, such as pink and lilac, on cotton fabrics, it is necessary

to subject the dyed goods to a long series of operations, such as soaping,
adding, &c. These processes are always attended with some risk of failure;
and besides that, a very large quantity of madder (an excess, in fact) must

be employed in dyeing, in order to obtain the ultimate effect desired. It is
evident that, if the impurities (resins, pectine, &c.) accompanying the
colouring-matters in the root could be removed or destroyed, the opera-

tions necessary after dyeing might be dispensed with or much curtailed,

since the object of these operations is precisely the removal of these im-

purities from the dyed fabric. lu the preparation of ordinary garancine

a portion of these impurities is removed, but those which are insoluble,

or difficulty soluble in water, remain behind for the most part, and subse-

Nowquently exert a prejudicial effect in dyeing.  the invention referred to

above consists in subjecting garancine whilst in a moist state to the influ-
ence of an elevated temperature in close vessels (or what comes to precisely

the same thing, to the action of high-pressure steam) for several hours.

What takes place during this process is not exactly known. According to

some experiments undertaken by one of us, if appears that the two red

colouring-matters contained in madder, viz. alizarine and purpurine, are not
in the least degree affected by it, whereas the pectic acid and some of the

resinous colouring-matters are charred, and thus rendered insoluble and inno-
cuous. Be this as it may, the result of the process is a product which, when

used for dyeing, yields colours requiring very little after-treatment in order

to give them the required degree of brilliancy, whilst they are quite as per-
manent as those produced by madder itself. The use of this material is

attended by a saving in dye-stuff, mordants, and soap, as well as in time and
labour. The results are also more certain. Moreover, when other colours,

such as brown and orange, are introduced in combination with madder colours,
the effect is much superior to that produced with madder, where the soapings

required to yield the desirable brightness deteriorate tlie other colours.

There are other advantages of a practical nature attending its use which

need not be here referred to. It has, however, one disadvantage, viz. that from
some unexplained cause it is not well adapted for dyeing pink ; and for this
colour it is therefore still necessary to employ unprepared madder. The pro-
duct has obtained the name of Commercial Alizarine, since the effect in dye-

ing is similar to that of the pure colouring matter, alizarine. It is manufac-

tured on a large scale by Messrs. Pincoffs and Co. Since its introduction in
1853, more than three million pieces of calico have been dyed with it in our

district and in Scotland.

Mr. Higgin prepares commercial alizarine by boiling garancine with water,

carbonate of soda, and a little ammonia. The liquid, which is alkaline at

Afirst, is boiled until it becomes acid.  short boiling gives a garancine

adapted for dyeing purple, whilst a boiling of twenty-four hours yields aliza-

rine.

  We may here mention Messrs. Roberts, Dale and Co.'s process for pre-

paring lakes, as the compounds of organic colouring-matters with various

bases are usually called. Such lakes, with a basis of alumina, have for a long
time been made from peachwood, sapanwood, and other dye-woods; but
                                                                              ;

126 REPORT 1861.

they had several disadvantages, which restricted their use in practice. They

were not permanent, they had little body, and they were gelatinous and con-

sequently cracked in drying. These disadvantages have been obviated by

Messrs. Roberts, Dale and Co., who employ oxide of tin as a base instead of

alumina, and produce lakes which, owing partly to their physical condition,

and partly to their chemical composition, possess the requisite degree of per-

manency and intensity of colour. The lakes prepared by the above-men-
tioned firm are sold to the paper-stainers, who make use of them for the

manufacture of a peculiar style of paper, called mock flocks, which form an

excellent imitation of true flock papers, and are consequently used in large

quantities.

Messrs. Roberts, Dale and Co.'s process for making a scarlet lake from

barwood, which is peculiar, may be here shortly described. The colouring-

matter of this wood is very slightly soluble in water. The ground wood is

therefore simply treated with boiling water, to which the requisite quantity

of precipitated oxide of tin is added. The boiling water dissolves some

colouring-matter, which is immediately separated by the oxide of tin, and

more colouring-matter then passes into solution to be precipitated as before,
the process being continued until the compound acquires the requisite inten-
sity of colour, and the wood is exhausted. The whole being now left to

repose, the wood, which is heavier than the dyed oxide of tin, sinks to the
bottom, leaving the pigment floating in the liquid. The latter is decanted

off", passed through fine sieves to separate some woody fibre, and allowed to

stand. The lake is deposited, and after being pressed is ready for use. The

quantity of this lake manufactured weekly by this firm is 2 tons, and the

price 8af. per lb.

   The production of artificial colouring-matters for practical purposes has
of late attracted much attention among scientific men and manufacturers.
To this class of products belongs Murexide, a body which, as far as we know,

does not occur ready-formed in nature. This substance, which was first

discovered by Prout, and subsequently examined by Liebig and Wohler, was

until very recently unknown out of the laboratory of the chemist. This arose

from the circumstance that uric acid, the only known source of murexide,

has not until recently been found to occur anywhere in large quantities.

The discovery of large beds of guano in various parts of the world has fur-

nished us with a material containing a sufficient quantity, however small, of

that acid to render the manufacture of murexide on a larger scale practicable

and it is now prepared in quantities surprising to those who have only seen
it made on the small scale in the laboratory. The process pursued may be

--shortly described as follows : The guano is first treated with dilute acid, in

order to decompose the ammoniacal salts contained in it. The residue left

by the acid is treated with caustic soda in order to dissolve the uric acid, and

the solution, decanted from the insoluble portion (consisting of phosphates,

sand, &c.), is supersaturated with muriatic acid. The precipitated uric acid
is filtered off, washed with water, and dried, when it has the appearance of a
brownish-white crystalline powder. The next part of the process consists in

treating the uric acid with nitric acid. Measured quantities of the latter are

poured into pots of about 1 gallon capacity, which stand in water for the

Apurpose of being kept cool.  certain weight of uric acid is then introduced,
--in small quantities at a time, into each pot a process which occupies about

ten hours. The liquid has now a dark-brown colour, and is generally covered
with a crystalline crust, consisting of alloxan and alloxantine. It may be

remarked that the process does not succeed well unless both these substances

--are present a fact already known from the researches of Liebig and Wohler.
                    PROGRESS OP CHEMISTRY IN SOUTH LANCASHIRE. 127

The liquid is then transferred to an enamelled vessel, diluted with water, and
mixed with an excess of carbonate of ammonia when the object is to pro-
duce murexide or purpurate of ammonia. Generally, however, carbonate
of soda is used, and in this case the product is purpurate of soda. The pre-
cipitated murexide or purpurate of soda is separated by filtration, washed
and dried. It has the appearance of an amorphous, puce-coloured powder.
The quantity manufactured by Mr. Rumney, of Manchester, amounted at
one time to 12 cwt. per week, for which about 12 tons of guano were re-
quired. The price was at first 305. per lb., but has now fallen to 15s. In

printing cotton goods with murexide, nitrate of lead is used as a solvent, the
solution properly thickened is printed, and the goods are then passed through
a bath of corrosive sublimate. Other methods are employed, but they all

depend on the use of salts of lead and mercury. The colour produced by
murexide is so brilliant as almost to justify the belief entertained by Liebig

and Wohier, that the celebrated Tyrian purple of the ancients was obtained
by its means.

                                  XXIII. Aniline Colours.

   The artificial colouring-matters from aniline and other bases have of late
attracted much attention, and various plans have been devised for pro-
ducing them. The usual method of obtaining aniline-purple, the so-called
" Mauve," consists in submitting salts of aniline in watery solution to

the action of oxidizing agents, such as chromates or permanganates, or

the peroxides of manganese and lead. To these processes we may add

another, patented by Messrs. J. Dale and A. Caro, and carried out in prac-
tice by Messrs. Roberts, Dale and Co. This process is based upon the
fact that salts of aniline, when heated with solutions of perchloride of
copper, completely reduce it to the state of protochloride, with the simul-

taneous formation of a black precipitate containing aniline-purple. Messrs.
Dale and Caro dissolve one equivalent of a neutral salt of aniline in water,
and boil this solution during several hours with a mixture of copper salts
and alkaline chlorides corresponding to 6 equivalents of perchloride of
copper. After the reaction is completed the mixture is filtered, the black
precipitate well washed and dried, and afterwards extracted repeatedly with
dilute alcohol in order to dissolve out the colouring-matters, which it con-
tains in a remarkably pure state. These manufacturers have also produced
aniline-reds by heating anhydrous hydrochlorate of aniline with nitrate of

lead at 360° F. The product of this reaction is a bronze-like brittle mass,
which contains aniline-red, always accompanied by purple colours. Boiling
water extracts the red colouring-matters and separates them from the purple
dyes, which after some purification constitute valuable substitutes for the
mauve colour.

   The method of fixing these colouring-matters to cotton, invented by
Mr. Dale, jun., which promises to be valuable, may be mentioned here. The
goods are prepared with a solution of colouring-matter and tannin, and are
then passed through a bath containing tartar emetic. The aflSnity of the

former substances for antimony determines the fixation of the colour on

the fabric.

                                  XXIV. Disinfectants.

The manufacture of disinfectants has now become a regular and constant

one                 and since  the inquiries  instituted on the subject by one of us and  Mr.
                 ;

M'Dougall of this city, the use of those made in this district has been

enormously increased. Mr. M'Dougall manufactures, near Oldham, a disin-
                                                                               ;

128 REPORT 1861.

fecting-powder, in which the properties of carbolic and sulphurous acid are

taken advantage of. This powder is used to prevent decomposition in

stables, cowhouses, and among accumulations of putrescible matter, and

Agenerally for the prevention of decomposition in manures.  liquid is also

prepared with carbolic acid and lime-M'ater, which is applied for the purpose

of preventing decomposition in sewers, thus carrying out the idea first started
by one of us, of purifying whole cities by preventing the generation of gases

in sewer water, or among accumulations of refuse. This liquid is also used
to prevent the decomposition of animal matter when it cannot at once be
made use of, especially in the case of meat brought to market, or animals
that have died in the fields. The powder, which is called " M'Dougall's
disinfecting-powder," is simply a mixture of the sulphites of lime and mag-
nesia with the carbolates of the same beises. The carbolates of lime and

magnesia are formed by simply boiling carbolic acid for a long time with the

bases in a caustic state. The solution consists of carbolic acid dissoU'ed in

lime-water. It is extremely bulky ; still xvVo*-'^ ^o TrrVrrt'^ P^""* of t'^e bulk of

the sewer water is sufficient to disinfect the latter. The solution of the powder
has also been used to some extent in dissecting-rooms, where it immediately

destroys any noxious smell, and at once liberates the fingers of the operator

from the peculiarly nauseous odour which so often attaches to them. It has

also been found useful in the treatment of sores, as well as of dysentery.

M. Leraaire has lately read papers on tar oil and phenic acid ; but Man-

chester claims priority in the application and explanation of these prepa-

rations.

   Mr. M'Dougall has also applied carbolic acid to the destruction of para-
sitic insects on sheep, and has in many districts entirely driven out the

arsenical preparations by the use of this acid united with fatty substances.
Sheep dipped in it are not liable to be attacked by tick, even when left for
some months among other sheep infested with it. Foot-rot and other diseases
of sheep are also said to be prevented and cured by its use.

   Mr. Pochin has introduced lately a very extensive manufacture which has
greatly affected the mode of using alumina, and also the manufacture of
alum. The substance is called alum-cake. It is sulphate of alumina with
about 16 equivalents of water and silica. Very fine white clay is stirred
round with sulphuric acid of about 140*0 sp. gravity, then warmed to about
100° F., and poured into a square trough with moveable sides. In a few
minutes the action of the acid on the clay becomes very violent, and a
sulphate of alumina is formed with the silica of the clay intimately mixed.
If very strong sulphuric acid is used, the action becomes so violent that the
whole mass is thrown out of the trough. The whole hardens into a compact
mass difficult to break. To facilitate the fracture, wedges of iron were
pressed into the mass when soft, the sides of the trough were taken down,
and by striking the wedges the whole was broken into pieces. Now, how-
ever, a more elaborate machine is used to break it up into small portions.

    In this manufactured article there is a large quantity of alumina, viz. 12"8
per cent, in a soluble form ; the trouble of crystallizing is avoided, and the

silica is in no way injurious in most cases. In some cases, where alum is

used with resin for paper size, the addition of the silica is indeed consi-

dered an advantage. At any rate, the manufacture is constantly increasing
if silica be objected to, it is allowed to fall down, and a clear solution of

sulphate of alumina remains.

On Elhno-Climatology ; or, the Acclimatization of Man. By James
  Hunt, Ph. D., F.S.A., F.R.S.L., Foreign Associate of the An-

   thropological Society of Paris, Honorary Secretary of the Ethnolo-
   gical Society of London.

       [A communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

One of the most important and practical duties of the ethnologist at the

present day is the endeavour to discover the laws which regulate the health

of man in his migrations over tlie world. The generally received opinions

on this important subject are, however, vague and unsatisfactory.

From some cause, it is the popular belief that man stands entirely alone

in the animal kingdom with regard to the influence exerted on him by

Weexternal causes.  are told that man can thrive equally well in the

burning heat of the tropics and in the icy regions at the poles.

I purpose, therefore, in this paper to examine how far the supposition of

man's cosmopolitan power is warranted by an induction from the facts at

Wepresent known to us.]  can gain nathing in Climatology from ^' a priori"

arguments, as it is entirely an experimental science ; and hitherto we have

not been able to foretell with any certainty the exact effect wliicii any

climate would exert on an individual or a race. No one who reflects on the

important bearings which the question of man's cosmopolitanisnt introduces

will be inclined to doubt the gravity of the question, and its claims to tlie

serious attention, not only of ethnologists, but of all wiio are interested in

the great problem of man's future. destiny. This question then has equal

claims on the attention of the philosopher and the statesman. Our data

may be at present insufficient to found an exact science of Ethno-Clim ito-

logy, but I trust to be able to show that there exist the outlines of a great

science, which bids fair to prevent that waste of human life which has

hitherto characterized the reckless policy of British colonization. Dr. Bou-

din, who is well known for his researciies on this and kindred subjects, has

recently called the attention of the Anthropological Society of Paris to the

question, and laments the great inattention which public men have hitherto

given to such an important and grave subject. He very justly observes,

" The problem is certainly one of the most important in the science of

ethnology; for it governs the great questions of colonization, of recruiting

men destined for distant expeditions, and of fixing the duration of the sojourn

of foreign troops at certain stations, so as to render them effective in war.

This question touches public health and social economy." Nor will it bo
necessary for me further to ask attention, when it is considered how largely

the British nation is practically interested in having a correct and physiolo-

gical system of colonization. 1 therefore bring this subject under your con-

sideration with a desire of calling public attention to the powers of acclima-

tization possessed by the races of man in general, and by Europeans in
particular. It is asserted that to man belongs the exclusive privilege of

being the denizen of every region; for that with plants and animals such is

not the case. This explanation has as often been accepted as satisfactorily

showing that man enjoys privileges over the animal and vegetable kingdoms.

That races of men are found in every climate is perfectly true ; but a slight
examination into the differences and peculiarities of the races of men will

show that this argument is not so forcible as at first sight it appears.

Theorists have often indulged in boasting of the superiority of man over

the animal kingdom in his migrations over the world; but these writers

have forgotten that it is civilization which greatly aids man to adapt himself

Wc(for a time) to every climate.  have heard much, too, of the acclimati-

zation of animals ; but there has been great exaggeration as to what has been

really effected.

   No one will attempt to deny that, physically, mentally, and morally, there

does exist a very considerable difference between the denizens of different
parts of the earth ; and it is not proposed to inquire whether the various
agents which constitute climate, and their collateral effects, are sufficient to

produce the changes in physique, mind, and morals which we find ; but,
simply taking the various types of man as they now occur on the earth, we
have to determine whether we are justified in assuming that man is a cos-
mopolitan animal, and whether the power of acclimatization be possessed
equally by all the races of man known to us.

   The conditions which prevent or retard the acclimatization of man are

physical, mental, and moral. It is, however, impossible to discuss the effect

of climate only on man, because we find that food is inseparably connected
with climate, and that both are modified by the physical conformation of the
districts inhabited. The exercise or neglect of mental culture must also be
considered. It is therefore nearly impossible to decide to Avhich class we
must ascribe certain effects ; but there can be little doubt that all these causes
act in harmony, and are insensibly bound together. In speaking, therefore,
of climate, I use the word in its fullest sense, and include the whole cosmic
phenomena. Thus, the physical qualities of a country have an important
connexion with climate ; and we must not simply consider the latitude and

 longitude of a given locality, but its elevation or depression, its soil, its
 atmospheric influences, and also the quantity of light, the nature of its
 water, the predominance of certain winds, the electrical state of the air, &'C.,
 atmospheric pressure, vegetation, and aliment, as all these are connected with

 the question of climate.

   Now we find man scattered over the globe, and existing and flourishing

 under the most opposite circumstances. Indeed, there seems no part of the

 earth in which man could not, for a period at least, take up his dwelling.

 When Capt. Parry reached Si" of north latitude, it was the ice, and not
 the climate, which prevented him from reaching the pole. Man may live

 where the temperature exceeds the heat of his blood, and also where mer-

 cury would freeze ; so man may exist where the atmospheric pressure is
 only one-half of what it is at the level of the sea. Men have been found

 permanently residing 12,000 feet above that level.
     There is a difference between the climate of the N. and S. hemispheres

 under apparently the same circumstances. Thus, the European cannot live
 for any time at any great elevation in the northern hemisphere. The
 highest inhabited place of Europe has generally been considered to be the

 Casa Inglese, a small building of lava on Mount Etna, near the foot of the
 uppermost crater, 9200 feet above the level of the sea. There is, however,

 a house in the Theodal Pass, between Wallis and Piedmont, at an elevation
 of 10,000 feet*. These buildings are, however, only inhabited during the

 summer months. In the southern hemisphere there are permanent inhabit-

  ants in regions from ten thousand five hundred feet to twelve thousand feet

 above the level of the sea. Dr. Tschudi, who has himself resided in these
 regions, describes what is known as the " Puna sickness," which is what may
 i)e called a mountain-sickness, and very much resembles sea-sickness. The

  Peruvians live and thrive well at elevations of from seven to fifteen thousand

 --feet above the level of the sea heights said by some ob.-ervers to be often

  destructive to the whites. This difference between the north and south
  hemispheres is caused, perhaps, by the difference in attraction at the north

pole. In the northern hemisphere the ascent of a high mountain causes a

rush of blood to the head, and in the southern there is an attraction of blood

10 the feet; hence the cause of the sickness.

An examination of the human race shows us that every family presents

different modifications, which are doubtless connected in some way with the

Wenature of the cosmic influences by which they are surrounded.    know

that some plants and animals are peculiar to certain regions, and that if trans-

planted to other climates they degenerate or die ; such is the case with man.
In every climate we find man organized in harmony with the climate; and if

lie is not in harmony, he will cease to exist. The general scale of power for

enduring change is in certain respects in unison with the mental power of

the race, and is also dependent on the purity of blood. Uncivilized and

mixed races have the least power, and civilized pure races the greatest.

Every race of man, however, has certain prescribed geographical salubrious

limits from which it cannot with impunity be displaced. Such, at least, is

tlie lesson I have drawn from existing data. It is civilization which chiefly

enables the European to bear the extremes of climate. Indeed, a people

must be civilized to some extent before they desire to visit distant regions.

The Esquimaux, for instance, is perfectly happy in his own way, and has

no desire to move to a warmer climate. His whole body and mind are
suited for the locality ; and were he moved to a warm climate, he would

certainly perish. The whole organism of the Esquimaux is fitted solely

for a cold climate ; nor is such a supposition problematical and inexpli-

cable by known physical laws. On the contrary, the physiological expla-

nation of such a phenomenon is quite simple. Thus, the European going

to the tropics becomes subject to dysentery; and the Negro coming to

Europe, to pulmonary complaints. Europeans who have recently arrived

at the tropics are instantly known by their walk and general activity. This,

however, soon subsides, the organic functions become disturbed, the pulse

and circulation are more active, the respiration less so, while the muscular

fibre loses its energy ; the stomach also becomes very weak. The action of
the skin becomes abnormal, while the heat acts on and excites the liver.

It rs often stated that tropical climates stimulate the organs of generation,

but this is contrary to experience. That there is a low state of morality,

and that the inhabitants of these regions are essentially sensual, cannot be

denied just as the cold region is distinguished by the gluttony of its
                               ;

inhabitants, and temperate regions by increased activity of brain.

The geography of disease has a most important bearing on this subject.

It is somewhat strange that man sufl'ers more from epidemics than animals,

and this is probably owing to his neglect of the laws of diet, which require

to be adapted to every climate. Thus we find that the temperate zone,

which ought to be by far the healthiest, has more diseases than either the

hot or the cold zones.  The cold  zone has but a small  number of  diseases
                                                                                                            ;

and in the torrid zone the number is not large, although the diseases

are generally very malignant. Attempts have been made to classify diseases

--into three categories those of hot, cold, and temperate regions. Such a

classification is, however, arbitrary and most unsatisfactory ; for the same

climate may be found in each of the three regions. In the tropics there are

temperate and cold regions, just as there is equatorial heat in the temperate

zone. Dr. Fuchs* distinguishes these three regions of disease. The first he

calls the Catarrhal region. This is so denominated because catarrh of the

respiratory organs predominates in it. "Catarrh," he says, "is the com-

moil cause of disease in tlie north temperate zone, between 1300 and 3000
 feet above the level of the sea; in the central temperate zone, between two
and seven thousand ; within the tropics, between seven and fourteen thou-
sand feet; in the cold zone, near tiie level of the sea." The other two
regions he culls the Entero-mesenteric region, in which gastric complaints
predominate, and the Dysenteric region, in which there is no scrofula or
tubercular disease. Without entering into the value of this classification,

--medical statistics seem to prove that there are three zones: 1st, the cold

 or catarrhal zone ; 2nd, the tropical or dysenteric zone ; and 3rd, the tem-
perate or gastric and scrofulous zone. This last zone, however, seems to
 be subject to the diseases of the other two zones, which prevail respectively

according to the seasons. The scrofulous zone ceases at an altitude of two

 thousand feet above the level of the sea; here there is no pulmonary con-
 sumption, scrofula, cancer, or typhus fever.

     It has been suggested that the perfection of the races in the temperate
 zone depends on the conflict to whicli they are subjected by the irruption

--of diseases from the otiier zones, the unfavourable climatic conditions

producing a human organism capable of resisting them. Dr. Russdorf*
says, " The climatic conditions of the temperate zone act in the formation
of blood in such a manner that a large quantity of albumen is present in
it. This richness in albumen is manifestly requisite to produce and nourish

the powerful brain which distinguishes the Caucasian race; ibr the brain
mainly consists of albumen combined with phosphoi'ated fatty matter."
"It is the brain of the Caucasian which determines his superiorit}- over
the other races ; it is tiie standard of the power ol' the organism ; it might be
termed the architect of the body, as its influence upon the formation of

matter is paramount. The effect of the atmosphere upon the formative acti-

vity of the organism and upon the nietamorph.osis of matter is so great, that
it is, for instance, on the intiuence of the oxygen absorbed by the skin and
the lungs that the metamoi'f)hosis of tlie albumen into muscle, &C., directly
depends. The atmosphere of the temperate zone favours such a change of
matter that the blood remains rich in albumen, so that a large brain can be

nourished. But this richness in albumen is also the cause of many charac-
teristic diseases, when this substance, under the process of infiauunation, is

morbidly excited in the tissue of the organs and destroys their anatomical
structure or organic mechanism. That general condition, in which the con-
sumption of the albumen by the organic metamorphosis is deficient, is well
known as the scrofulous predisposition of tlie European, which is unknown

among the inhabitants of the tropics and the cold zone."

   Two questions then await a solution : l.-t. Can any race of men flourish,

unchanged both mentally and physically, in a different ethnic centre from
that to which it belongs ?

   'ind. Can any race of men move from its own ethnic centre into another,
and become changed into the type of that race Mhich inhabits the region

to which it migrates?

   Now, races of men moving from one region to another must either dege-
nerate and become extinct, or flourish with the same distinctive characters
that they have in their own regions, or they must gradually become changed
into new types of men suited to their new positions.

   That new races of men are being formed at this time is highly probable,
as where, for instance, we have in a particular region a class of' men with the
same temperament and character. This may, as in the case of America,

give rise to a new race, but still belonging to the European type, just as we
have in this country the distinctive class of the Quakers, &c. But this

change in the so-called Anglo-Saxon race could have been effected without

removing them out of their own region. If these men had congregated
togetiier in Europe, we should have had a group of men with different feel-
ings and opinions from our own. The congregation of a number of men
and women of similar character would always tend to increase or intensify
the special characteristics of the descendants of such people. Some writers,

in their anxiety to prove that climate has nothing to do with the varieties
of man, deny that there is any change in the European inhabitants of
America ; but recent events have given strong proof that there is a change,
both in mind, morals, and physique ; and while this change is not to be
entirely ascribed to the climate, there still is good presumptive evidence that

the Europeans have changed in America, especially in North America. In

the children of the colonists there is a general languor, great excitability,

and a want of cool energy. As they grow up, they neglect all manly sports.
This general excitability and want of coolness and energy are also seen in the
whole Yankee race. The women become decrepit very early, and conse-

quently cease to breed while still young. It is also affirmed that the second

and third generations of European colonists have small families. Some
fifteen years ago. Dr. Knox stated publicly that he believed the Anglo-
Saxons would die out in America if the supply of new blood from Europe
was cut off. Such an assertion was, indeed, startling for any man to make

it seemed to bear on the face of it a palpable absurdity. But, as time
has passed on, this statement certainly becan)e less baseless, and is now, at
least, an hypothesis as worthy of our attention as any other explanation of
tliis difficult question. Emerson has recently remarked on this extraordinary
statement of Dr. Knox, that there is more probability of its truth than is
generally thought. Emerson* says, " Look at the unpalatable conclusions

--of Knox a rash and unsatisfactory writer, but charged with pungent and

unforgetable truths." He continues, " The German and Irish miUions, like

the Negro, have a deal of guano in their destiny. They are ferried over the
Atlantic, and carted over America to ditch and to drudge, to make corn
cheap, and then to lie down prematurely to make a spot of green grass on

the prairie."

    I do not purpose to give any categorical answers to the queries suggested,
but simply to bring forward some facts, and to give the opinions of some

men who have paid attention to this and allied questions. Thus I trust to
lay a basis for further investigation, and induce more labourers to enter the

field for the purpose of developing this important question.

   We must not take latitude simply as any test of climate ; for the general

 climatological influences are very different in various regions. Thus, it has
 been noticed that the west coast is colder than the cast in the southern

liemisphere, while in the northern the cast is colder than the westf. In
the French Antilles, the temperature is between 62° F. to 77° F. on the
shore, and descends to 55° F. or 60° F. at eight hundred metres above the

level of the sea. At Fernando Po, the greatest heat known was from 83° to
 100° F. generally it is about 73° F. So French Guiana is said not to have

                                          ;

a higher temperature than Algeria. Some parts of Australia and New

 Zealand are nearer the equator than Algiers, and yet the temperature and

salubrity are very different. The effect of light is also most important, and

is not merely confined to the skin, but affects the whole organism. The pre-

sence of light modifies the qualities of the air; it also acts on the nervous

system. If we look at the analogy of the effect of the absence of light on
organized beings generally, we shall readily understand the influence whicii
it exerts on man. Europeans, indeed, who live in darkness have colourless

skin, the muscles soft, and the whole body bloated. It is, therefore, a ques-

tion which has yet to be decided, how far the Esquimaux's ill- formed frame
may be produced by the want of light. And here we find that insensibly

our attention is called to the vexed question of the unity or the plurality of

origin of mankind. With that subject, however, we have at present nothing

to do. It is, however, on the assuuiption of unity of origin that the cos-

mopolitan powers of man have been imagined to exist. I hold the questions

of unity or plurality, however, to be of little or no consequence in the pre-

sent state of our knowledge.

   When we see that plants and animals vary in different climates, we are led

to expect that man will also vary with the climate. Plants growing like

trees in the tropics, become dwarfed in cold climates. It would, indeed, be
strange that, as all animals vary, man should remain unchanged. But while
admitting that man exists in harmony with external circumstances, we do
not admit that one type of man can be changed into another. As the rose

will under no change of external circumstances become a blackberry, so

Weneither will a dog become a wolf, nor a European an African Negro.

shall, therefore, principally confine our attention to the inquiry whether man

migrating from one region to another gradually degenerates. If there is

degeneration going on, it is simply a question of time, as to how soon his

race will become extinct. I shall, therefore, contend that any race migrating

from one centre to another does degenerate both mentally and physically.

Indeed, the psychical change produced in man by climatological influence is
as soon visible as the change produced on his physical i'rame. When, for

instance, the European goes to Africa, he, for a short time, retains his vigour

of mind ; but soon he finds his energies exhausted, and becomes listless, and

nearly as indifferent to surrounding events as the natives. There is, how-

ever, a considerable difference in the effects produced both on individuals of

the same race, as also on the different races of men. Some are affected im-

mediately on their arrival, and then appear to become partially acclimatized ;
often the disease increases until it becomes very serious ; again, others are

attacked, without any warning, with either inflammation of the brain or liver.

Others, again, do not appear at first to be at all affected ; but gradually the

strength gives way, the countenance becomes despondent, and chronic disease

of the liver or stomach results.

Neither can the inhabitants of tropical regions generally withstand the

influence of removal to a cold climate.  Much, however, depends on race
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

for the different races of man have different degrees of adaptability for

Wechange of climate.  cannot, however, yet decide the exact powers of

each race, as ethno-climatology is a new study, and a long series of obser-

vations is required before a satisfactory answer can be given.

Before I proceed to indicate the sort of evidence we can get from that

most valuable of all modern sciences, statistical science, I think it will

be well that I should quote some few authorities to show that there is an

agreement between the most recent writers on this subject and the lesson

we learn from statistics. Dr. A. S. Thomson, who has paid great attention

to this subject, observes, " There is little doubt that the tropical parts of

the world are not suited by nature for the settlement of natives of a tem-

perate zone. European life is but with difficulty prolonged, much sickness
                             --

is suffered, and their offspring become degenerate and cease to propagate
(heir species in a few generations; and should necessity force Europeans to

perform the drudgery of labouring in the field, their lives will be rendered

still shorter, and their existence little better than a prolonged sickness."

Dr. Thomson has entered into the various attempts of the Portuguese, Dutch,

English, JVench, and Danes to colonize India. He has also dwelt on the

attempts of the Dutch and Spaniards at colonization in the Indian Archi-
pelago, and also on the state of European colonies in tropical Africa and
tropical America. His conclusion is, " that man can only flourish in climates
analogous to that under which his race exists, and that any great change is
injurious to liis increase and also to his mental and physical development."

   Sir Alexander Tulloch well observes, that military returns, properly orga-.
nized and digested, serve as the most useful guides " to point out the limits

--intended by nature for particular races, and in which alone they can thrive

and increase" boundaries which neither the pursuit of wealth nor the dreams

of ambition should induce them to pass, and proclaim, in forcible language,
tiiat man, like the elements, is controlled by a Power which hath said,
" Hither slialt thou come, but no further."

Let us glance at the attempts of tiie French to colonize the North of Africa.
The mortality of the civil population in France is about twenty-five in a

thousand, while the average mortality of the civil population in Algiers, in

1853, was 435, and in ISS*, 53*2 in a thousand. "In all the localities of
Algiers, without exception," says M. Boudin, " the mortality of the Euro-
pean population exceeds by far, not merely the normal mortality of England

and France, but even that of the cholera years in these two countries."

Notwithstanding these facts, the population is annually increasing by the
influx of inmiigrants. As regards other colonies, the following table, quoted

by M. Boudin from the official report of the Ministry of Algeria, published

in 1859, speaks for itself:

Guadaloupe                                       Births.   Deaths.
Guiana
Reunion                                        20,095     20,675
                                                 2,333      2,830

                                               18,934     20,775

This would be more satisfactory had the proportion of the women to men

been also given.

   But, before I proceed on this side of the question, I would call attention

to the statement frequently made by the President of this Section. On

one occasion, for instance, Mr. Crawfurd* said, " It has been confidently

asserted that the British possessions in India are an unfit residence for the

permanent dwelling of Englishmen, although within the same latitudes with

the warm parts of America, and portions of it even more distant from the

equator." " No less an authority," continues Mr. Crawfurd, " than the late

Duke of Wellington gave it as his opinion that Europeans, especially in

Lower Bengal, most of which is without the tropics, would die out in a third

generation ; but it is certain that this was an hypothesis of His Grace un-

supported by facts." Mr. Crawfurd further contends that the Duke of

Wellington's observation was made at an unfavourable time, and that at

Nowpresent the case is very different.         all recent facts and observations

prove that the Duke of Wellington was right. From numerous private in-

quiries of residents in India I have obtained confirmation of this opinion.

We have, moreover, the most extensive writers and observers on tropical

diseases giving exactly similar opinions.

   Sir Ranald Martin* says, "Of those Europrans who arrive 6n the banks

of the Gangps, many fall early victims to the climate, as will be shown here-
after. That others droop, and are forced, ere many years, to seek their

native air, is also well known. That the successors of all would gradually
and assuredly degenerate if tliey remained in the country cannot be ques-
tioned ; for already we know that the third generation of unmixed Europeans

is nowhere to he found in BengaW

   William Twining also made the same assertion many years ago.

   Another recent authority on India t, Mr. Julius Jeffreys, saj's, "Few

children of pure English blood can be reared in the plains of India, and
of that few the majority have constitutions which might cause them to

envy the lot of those who die in their childhood. The mortality of bar-

rack children is appalling, especially in the months of June, September,
and October. At Cawnpore from twenty to thirty have died in one month.
In short, the soldiery leave no descendants of unmixed blood." Major-
General Bagnold % has also said, that the oldest English regiment, the

Bombay " Toughs," notwithstanding that marriages with British females

are encouraged, have never been able, from the time of Charles II. to this
time, to raise boys enough to supply the drummers and fifers. Dr. Ewart §

says, " Our race in process of time undergoes deterioration, physically and

intellectually, with each succeeding generation, and ultimately ceases to

multiply and replenish the earth." He also says, " that there is a certain

deterioration of our race always, under present circumstances, tending to

extinction in this country."

   It remains, therefore, with Mr. Crawfurd and those who agree with him to
accept these facts, or explain wliat has become of the descendants of the half
million of people who have gone to India. It is generally supposed that there

is a process of acclimatization going on with Europeans living in the tropics;
but the reverse is rather the case. It is true that the mortality is sometimes
greater at first, but this is owing to tlie clearing out of the weakened and other

defective constitutions whicli had been broken down by disease or intempe-

rance. When this has taken place, there appears to be an improvement; but

after the first year there is a gradual decline in health, and sickness and

mortality greatly increase. We have exhaustion and degeneracy, but no real

acclimatization. Although Europeans suffer less on going to colder regions,
Btill we observe the same fact in that case. Dr. Armstrong and others have
 observed that Europeans resist the cold of the polar regions better the first

 year than they do the second, and that every subsec^uent year they feel the

 efTeets of climate more.

    This fact can be amply proved by statistics. As age increases, so does

 mortality in any place out of the native land of a people.

of the white troops serving at Ceylon, from 1837 to ISiG, was 41 ·74

per thousand ; and in 1859 the mortality decreased to 35*06 : while, with
the so-called black troops, the deaths in a thousand, from 1837 to 184'6,

were 26*71 ; and in 1859, 10-19. The ratio of mortality with the Ceylon
Rifles (Malays) is the same as that of the male population of this country.

In the same Report we find, under the head of China, what are called
" native troops," which we discover to be Bengal Native Infantry, &c. The

mortality of these troops from India is at the rate of 53-73 per thousand,

without reckoning those who died subsequently from disease contracted

in China; while, with the British troops serving in China, the mortality

--slightly exceeded that of the Indian troops, being 59*35 per thousand no

less than 42-58 of this number having died of miasmatic disease. Sir T. G.
Logan, in his Report on the Sanitary State of the Army, says, " The topo-
graphical character, however, of Hong Kong was acknowledged to preclude

improvement to any considerable extent in the health of European troops,

and its retention as the chief military station of the command could not

be thought desirable in a sanitary point of view. .The principal medical

officer's report refers to the circumstance that the annual expenditure of

men by death and invaliding had been averaged at 20 per cent., being more

than double of what it is in India ; and that, notwithstanding every means

had been taken, and no expense spared, to preserve the health of the troops,

the results were still very unsatisfactory."

But the great mistake which most writers on the. diseases of tropical

countries commit is the neglect to ascribe the large amount of disease to

the true source, viz. the inadaptibility of Europeans to tropical countries.

Nearly every medical writer on the diseases of India tries to prove that the

large mortality is produced by some preventable cause ; but a little inquiry
into the diseases which attack the natives and Europeans will destroy this

delusive hope. First, then, with a given strength of Europeans and natives

we find that, with the three sorts of fevers, intermittent, remittent, and

continued, there are in

     Bengal                        3-76 deaths of Europeans to 1 Native.

   The large amount of deaths among the native soldiers may be greatly

ascribed to tlie inadaptibility of our English pharmacopcEia. Since our con-
tact with the natives they are every year becoming more liable to all sorts

of diseases, but especially fevers and bovicl diseases. The high mortality

amongst the natives must, therefore, be greatly ascribed to our inability to
check disease in tiiem. The deaths to the number of admissions are even
greater amongst the natives tlian amongst Europeans. This, in itself, is a
pretty good evidence for the assertion that a healing art has yet to be dis-

covered for their constitutions.

   Then with dysentery and diarrhcea, the proportion of deaths of Euro-

peans to natives is in

Bengal                  11-67 of Europeans          to I Native.

Bombay                      8-73         ,,         to 1           ,,
Madras                      6*53         ,,
                                                    to 1           ,,

   The contrast is sufficiently great with fevers and dysentery ; but it is still
more marked with hepatitis :

lu Bengal, 60 Europeans die of hepatitis to 1 Native.

Bombay, 44              ,,                   ,, 1,,

Madras, 30              ,,                   ,, 1,,

Even in those hot-beds of disease, the Indian jails, we find the inmates arc

far more free from hepatitis than our own troops in Bombaj' : the Europeans

are attacked thirteen times oftener than the natives; in Bengal, forty-three

times; and in Madras, our soldiers one hundred and seventy-eight times

oftener.

   Some writers have endeavoured to show that this disease is produced in
Europeans by intemperance. But Dr. INIorehead* says, " The evidence

that intemperance in drinking exerts a particular influence in the produc-

tion of hepatitis is by no means conclusive ;" and he also says, " The occur-

rence of hepatitis, on the other hand, in its severest form is not an unusual

--event in persons of temperate habits, a statement which practitioners in

India generally will, I am sure, amply confirm."
   With CHOLERA, the ratio of mortality is in

Bengal                      6' Europeans to 1 Native.

Bombay                      2-6 ,,           1,,
Madras
                            1*18         ,,  1,,

There is also another fact which demands attention, viz. the increase of

mortality in cases attacked with this disease. Whatever may be the cause,

there seems to have been far higher mortality in Bengal since 1838, and in

Madras since 1842, than before those periods. Thus, the relative mortality to

the cases treated in Bengal lias risen in each period of five years, from 1818

to 1853, from 267], 31-17, 21-80, 26-91, 55-53, 45*22, and 41*92 per

cent; and in Bombay, during the same time, from 18-53, 22-71, 30-58,

18-87, 37-33, 45-46, and 43-17; and in Madras, from 1829 to 1851, from

27-11,27-63, 48, and 62-31.

Tliere has been an increase of mortality of natives to cases treated, in

Madras, of 7'26 per cent.; in Bengal the mortality is about the same; and

a decrease of 3 per cent, in Madras.

With phthisis (consumption) the percentage of mortality to a given

strength is^r

In Bengal                        11 deaths of Europeans to 1 Native.

Bombay                           4,,        ,, 1,,

Thus, the deaths of Europeans from phthisis even exceed the native pri-

soners in our Indian jails.

In the various other diseases which have not been mentioned, the

mortality is far higher, being, in Bengal, as 3 Europeans to 1 native, and in

Bombay as 3-2 Europeans to 1 native.
   Many Avriters have observed that, with the natives, those most free from

disease are those who toil all day in the burning sun, with no covering at all

on the head. Ignorance as to the difference of race has induced some
commanders to attempt thus to harden the Europeans, with results some-

thing frightful to contemplate.

One of the regiments that had been the longest in India, the Madras

Fusileers, is stated to have been reduced from eight iiundred and fifty to

one hundred and ninety fit for duty. M^ny similar cases have been pro-

duced by needless exposure. Mr. Jeffreys says, " that Her Majesty's 41th

Regiment in 1823 were nine hundred strong, and a very fine body of men.

The commanding officer insisted that confinement of the men during the

day was effeminate, and continued drilling them after the hot season had
begun. But the men suffered the penalty of the officer's ignorance. For

some months," says Mr. Jeffreys, " not less than one-third, and for some
weeks one-half, of the men were in hospital at once, chiefly witli fever,

dysentery, and cholera. I remember to have seen, for some time, from five

to ten bodies in the dead-room of a morning, many of them specimens of

athletes." Experience has shown that it is not tiie absolute exposure to

the sun from which Europeans suffer; it is the subsequent effects which are

to be dreaded. On a march, the European will appear to be equal to the

thick-skinned native; but he soon learns that such is not tiie case.

   The European soldier is also unfitted to stand the effects of a cold climate
after some years' residence in India, and dreads to return home to encounter

tiie cold and hardships of English peasant-life. With officers, who can

return to enjoy all the comforts and luxuries of civilization, the case is dif-

ferent. The few soldiers who remairj in India have more or less chronic

diseases, which, says Mr. Jeffreys, " would render the attainment of any-

thing like longevity out of the question."

   Seventy-seven per cent, of the European troops in Bengal are under thirty,
twenty-three per cent, above that age; or ninety-four per cent, are under

thirty-five, the remaining six above that age.

   From Dr. Ewart* we learn that the European army has hitherto disap-
peared in Bengal in about ten and a half years; in Bombay, in thirteen and

a half; in Madras, in seventeen and a half; or in all India, in about thirteen

Weand a half years.  find the percentage of deaths to strength amongst

European regiments, in Bengal, 6-94; in Bombay, 5-52; in Madras, 3-88.

Thus we find that, on adding all these diseases of European troops together,

we get a mortality of at least seven per cent, for the whole of India, while

142 REPORT 1861.

with the native troops the mortality does not amount to a half per cent.

Sir A. TuUocIi says, that " the total loss from all causes has been at least

seventy per thousand ;" and that " the proportion invalided annually may be

taken at about twenty-five per thousand more, and twcnty-five per thousand

to men not renewing their engagements ;" making altogether twelve per
cent., or one hundred and twenly per thousand. He further observes, that

the number of recruits raised during peace, from 184-5 to 1849 inclusive,
was less than twelve thousand ; and that, with a force of eighty thousand in
India, we shall require nine thousand and six hundred of them for India,
" unless," as he observes, " means can be adopted to reduce mortality and

invaliding."

Mr. Jeffreys says, the mortality of troops in India amounts to ten per

cent. He observes, " The casualties amongst the troops have, during peace,

amounted per annum to at least one thousand in every ten thousand; in

England and her healthy colonies they have ranged from about ninety to a

little above two hundred." Such being the undisputed fact, there is no
doubt, as Sir A. Tulloch has observed, that " the selection of healthier

stations for our troops than those they have hitherto occupied is no longer

a matter of choice, but one of necessity, as we cannot hope to keep up the

lart^e European army required to hold India without the strictest attention
to "this important measure." The late Sir H. Lawrence devoted much of

his life to the solution of this question in a practical manner. I'here is no

doubt that removing our military stations to the hills is a measure demanding

serious attention. Sir Ranald Martin is of opinion that, in Bengal and

the N.W. Provinces, the malaria might be escaped by an elevation of from

two thousand five hundred to four thousand feet. That this would be ad-

vantao-eous is quite probable ; but we shall not find in the hills the same

Weclimare we have in this country.  may escape the influence of malaria-

diseases, just as we escape the yellow fever in the West Indies, at an eleva-

tion of from two to three thousand feet. The Report for the Re-organization

of the Indian Army gives the mortality from 1815 to 1855, exclusive of

casualties, at a hundred thousand men, " the greater portion of whose lives,"

the Report says, " might have been preserved had better localities been

selected for the military occupation of that country." But are there any

places even in the hills in which Europeans can be reared without gradually

becomino- degenerated? This is a serious question, to which science can as

yet five no positive reply. Looking at the wisdom which is displayed in

the general distribution of mankind, we shall be inclined to answer in the

negative. It has been presumed that, because yellow fever is in a great

measure escaped in Jamaica at an elevation of about two thousand five

hundred feet, this elevation would be sufficient to escape malarious dis-

eases in other parts of the world ; but such is not the case. If we ascend

to any great height, we often get out of the region of malaria, and into the

region of bowel-diseases. It is also affirmed* that " intermittent fever origi-

nates in some of the Himalayah stations. At Aboo also, during the malarious

months, ague is very prevalent. Dr. Cooke (Bombay service), in his annual

report of the Khelat agency, states that ' Khelat, the highest inhabited spot

of the Beloochistan table-land, standing seven thousand feet above the level

of the sea, is also malarious.'"

   It has also been said by Sir John Lawrence, Brigadier-General Chamber-

lain, and Lieutenant-Colonel Edwards, that, besides our soldiers not liking
to live in the hills, the natives have not the power of believing in what they

cannot see ; and they join in asserting that " there are sick men whom the
liills make worse, and healthy men whom they make sick*." General Sir

A. TuUoch also allowsf that the stations at 8000 or 9000 feet of elevation
" are less healthy than was expected, because the men suffer from what is

called a hill diarrhoea, which reduces them very much indeed." Many other

authorities and facts tend to show that it is a great fallacy to assume that

temperature and climate are at all the same thing. There may be the

same ethnic climate, with vast difference of temperature. China, for in-

stance, has very different temperatures ; but this has hardly a perceptible

effect on the race.

   Dr. Ewart, like many other writers on this subject, has a theory which he

believes would enable Europeans to be reared in India. He says, "The

average standard of health of our race in this country would bear compa-

rison with that of any race on the face of the civilized world, or of any

people in Europe, provided the sources of malaria were dried up."

Although this is wholly a gratuitous assumption, we still have evidence

to show that a very slight ctiange is sufficient to make a considerable
change in the health of soldiers. Mr. M'Clelland| says, " that out of a

European force of little more than one thousand, there were four or six

funerals daily ; and this great mortality was checked by a change to the hills,
which were only one hundred or one hundred and fifty feet high. It is

probably a mistake, however, to attribute this favourable change in the

mortality to the climate ; it was doubtless far more due to the influence on
the brain and nervous system. If the cause which produces eimui amongst

all classes of European residents in India could be eradicated, then perhaps

Athe case might be different.  number of plans have been proposed to en-

able the European to live in India. In 1853-4, the expenditure for cinchona

bark and quinine amounted to a6ll,686. It is now proposed to give quinine

as a prophylactic for fevers, and there will be a demand for 3646,744 worth§.

with his theory of inoculation, is to transfuse a small quantity of blood taken

from the natives into the veins of Europeans visiting such places as India,

Brazil, or the West Coast of Africa ! I would only beg to express a hope

that in transfusing this blood they will not also transfer any of the mental or

moral characteristics of these indigenous races into the European. If any

process, however, can be devised to make Europeans like the natives, then we

must remember that, instead of being able to hold down one hundred and

fifty millions of people with about one hundred thousand men, we should

want a very different number. It is only possible to hold India as long as

Europeans remain the superior race. It has been asserted that, although

they cannot bear the sudden change to a tropical climate, they can gradually

become accustomed to the change. It seems a fair test of the influence of

climate on race, to study its effects on the children of those who have be-
come accustomed to the change, or, as it is sometimes falsely called, " accli-

Wematized." Here there can be no question as to the effects of climate.

and nearly the same result meets us elsewhere. Speaking of the effect of

island till eight or ten years of age, when anxiety begins to be excited by the
attenuation of the frame and the apparent absence of strength in proportion
to development. These symptoms, liie result of relaxed tone and defective
nutrition, are to be remedied by change of climate, either to the more lofty
ranges of the mountains or more providently to Europe."

   Many writers, who contend that Europeans can become completely ac-

climatized, contradict themselves in their statements respecting the rearing of

children. Mr. Robert Clarke, who has some eighteen years' experience on the

Gold Coast and at Sierra Leone, goes so far as to say*, " It is questionable
whether persons of colour are better able to bear up against the influence
of climate than persons of pure European blood, provided the latter are
sober in their habits. There can be no doubt that Europeans, on their first
arrival in West Africa, are in greater danger of losing their lives than the
former; but when once they have become acclimatized, they seem generally

to withstand tiie influence of the climate better than coloured people,

provided, I repeat, they are temperate in their habits." If this be so, we

should not expect to find great mortality amongst children born of " tempe-
rate, acclimated Europeans." But Mr. Clarke saysf, "Great difficulty is
experienced in rearing European children. They in general thrive admi-
rably until teething begins. It is at this epoch they are frequently harassed
with intermittent iever, which by repeated occurrence causes enlargement
of the spleen and functional disturbance of the stomach and bowels, when
they soon became cachectic, and unless removed to a more genial climate

drop into an early grave."

   Some authors think that the question of the European propagating himself

in the tropics has been settled by the fact that for three centuries the Spanish

race has lived and thrived in tropical America. Mr. Crawfurd says, "The

question whetiier the European race is capable of living and multiplying in
a tropical or other hot region seems to have been settled in the affirmative

on a large scale in America. Of the pure Spanish race there are at present

probably not fewer than six millions, mostly within the tropics." But it is
a wholly gratuitous assumption, unsupported by facts, to suppose that any-
thing like this number of the Spanish race exist in America. If we were to
read for Mr. Crawfurd's "millions" the word " thousands," we should per-
haps be nearer the truth. In Mexico it is estimated that there are not more
than ten thousand of the pure racej, reckoning both Creoles and immigrants.

What a small proportion is this to those who left their native land and have

never returned again! For three hundred years Spain has poured out her
richest blood on her American colonies, almost at the price of her own
extinction, without the slightest prospect of being able to establish a Spanish

race in Central America. Never was there a greater failure than the attempt

of the Spaniards to colonize tropical America. Those who have watched

the gradual change of the Spanish colonies must be convinced of the fallacy
of quoting this as a case of successful colonization of tropical countries by

Europeans. When the continual influx of new blood from Sjjain was taking

place, the change was not so much observed ; but, now emigration has ceased,
the pure Spanish race is diminishing rapidly. All recent observations show

 that the Indian blood is again showing out in a most remarkable maimer. In-

 stead of the Spaniards flourishing, there seems every prospect of their entire

    J It has since been asserted in the Cortes, by Don Pachero, that the pure Spanish race in
 Mexico does not amount to more than eight thousand. In 1793, Humboldt estimated the

extinction, unless fresh blood is sent from Europe. The extinction of the
 Spanish race in America was likewise predicted more than twenty years ago
 by Dr. Knox. There is no doubt that this result has been greatly owing to

 tlie mixture of Spanish and Indian blood.

    The laws regulating the mixture of human races do not directly concern

 the question of acclimatization; it has been found, however, that there is a
 different vitality between the offspring of the Spaniard and the Indian female,
from that between the Englishman and the Indian woman. So also there is
a different power of life between the offspring of the Portuguese and English
with the negro woman. It can hardly be questioned that the Spanish race,

like all other dark Europeans, are better suited for warm climates than the
white Europeans. M. Boudin gives some statistics to show that the Spaniards

and Italians also suffered less in the Great Russian campaign. Perhaps this

may be explained by other causes.
   On several occasions the Spaniards have attempted to colonize the beau-

tiful island, Fernando Po, but have entirely failed. The last trial was made
in 1859, when three hundred and fifty colonists were sent out, provided with

every necessary; but at the beginning of 1861 they had nearly all died, the

few remaining returning home entirely broken down in health.

   On the change effected in Europeans by a residence in Ceylon, Sir J.

Emerson Tennent observes*, " The pallid complexion peculiar to old resi-

dents is not alone ascribable to an organic change in the skin from its
being the medium of perpetual exudation, but in part to a deficiency of red

globules in the blood, and mainly to a reduced vigour in the whole muscular

apparatus, including the action of the heart, which imperfectly compensates
by increase of rapidity for diminution of power." This author very properly
warns all habitual dyspeptics from a long sojourn at Ceylon. Gouty patients

Weare, however, owing to the greater cutaneous excretion, entirely cured.

find that Europeans die mostly of cholera and inflammation of the liver,

while negroes die of pulmonary consumption. Ceylon is hot for Europeans,
and cold, especially in the forests, in comparison to the coast of Guinea.

   Of the island of Cuba, Mr. Tylor has just writtenf, " The climate of the

island is not unfavourable for a mixed negro and European race, while to

the pure whites it is deadly. It is only by intermarriage with Europeans,
and continual supplies of emigrants from Europe, that the white population
is kept up."

   In the Reports of the Colonies for 1858 and 1859, we only find the births
and deaths of the different populations of one colony given. From these we

learn that, at Antigua, in

1858 the births of white population were 50           deaths  75

Although this classification (of white, black, and coloured)! is not very

scientific, yet it would be of very great utility to get such simple returns

from all our colonies, with the percentage of women.

gions; and Pruner-Bay says " that the Turanian is, in physical respects, the

true cosmopolite."

   I have already stated that latitude is no test of climate ; so 1 would now

state, that as neither heat nor cold is the cause of the physical differences of

mankind, so neither is it mere heat or cold which affects man injuriously.

That the Chinese have a large range of temperature is true, but they have
not the great power of being acclimatized that many imagine. Fifty thou-
sand Chinese have gone to Australia, and the same number to California ;
and perhaps about twenty or thirty thousand to Cuba, and six thousand to
the Mauritius. This is a misfortune for both Australia and California; but
there is hope for Cuba, as the Chinese are said not to be able to work there.

Mr. Tylor says*, " Fortunately for them, they cannot bear the severe planta-
tion-work. Some die after a few days of such labour and exposure, many
more kill themselves; and the utter indifference with which they commit
suicide, as soon as life seems not worth having, contributes to moderate

the exactions of their masters. A friend of ours in Cuba had a Chinese

servant who was impertinent one day, and his master turned him out of the
room, dismissing him with a kick. The other servants woke their master

early next morning with the intelligence that the Chinese had killed himself

in the night to expiate the insult he had received."

  We are at present quite unable to say whether the Chinese will ever be-

come acclimatized in California or Australia. It is to be hoped, however,
that they will not be able. The Chinese have taken no women with them to
either place ; but in Australia some of them are living with native women,

and this may be the means of producing a hybrid race of Chinese-Aus-
tralians. Whether this may stay the current of extinction which seems
settling on the Australians, or whether it may aid in their destruction, are
questions beyond the limits of this paper. Of the Indian immigrants to the
Mauritius, we learn that the deaths exceeded the births by three hundred
and eleven, but we are not told of the percentage of women.

   The mortality generally of the colony was

           In 1854                          7 percent.

    In Trinidad, the total Indian population was, in 1859, thirteen thousand

four hundred and forty-seven, and the deaths 2*7 per cent. ; but amongst
the arrivals from Madras, the mortality was 7*7 per cent.

   In 1859, the mortality of the Calcutta coolies was 2 per cent.

   Of the Malays all we know is, that the Dutch took some to the Cape,
and the race still remains there, but whether pure or mixed we know very
little; we also are not informed if their numbers are increasing or decreas-
ing. Of the Red Indians we only know that, on being removed from their
native soil, they soon perish : it is uncertain how much of this must be
ascribed to the climate, or how much to the inability of the race to alter their

manners and customs.

   The royp,! family of the Sandwich Islands who visited England in 1827

all died, as did most of their attendants, of tubercular disease, after only three

months' visit.

   So the Andaman Islander taken to Calcutta by Dr. Mouat was soon

affected by the climate, and obliged to be returned to his native land to save

his life.

But perhaps the negroes offer the strongest proof of the fallacy of saying

Wethat all races of men are cosmopolitan.                                have ample and positive evidence

that they cannot perpetuate themselves beyond about the fortieth degree of

north or south latitude. Indeed, in their own region the ascent of a high

mountain will kill them, sometimes nearly instantly. Thus, out of the eight

Africans who ascended with Beecroft the Saint Isabel Mountain*, at Fer-

nando Po, no less than five died.

   The negro seems to thrive in the southern states of America ; but it is
far from probable that he is suited to all tropical countries. Sir A. Tulloch
and Dr. Bennett Dowler coincide in opinion that the negro will die out in
the West Indies and the Mauritius. At Cuba, Mr. Tylor sajsf, " there are
fifteen thousand slaves imported annually;" he also adds, "that the Creoles

of the country are a poor degenerate race, and die out in the fourth genera*

tion." The race is only kept up in Egypt and Algiers by constant immigra-

tion.

In the Mauritius, the deaths in five years exceeded the births by upwards

of six thousand, in a population of sixty thousand.
   Dr. Boudin says, " In Ceylon, in ISil, there was not a trace of the nine

thousand negroes imported by the Dutch government before the English

domination. Of the five thousand negroes imported by the English since

1803, there remained only, in IS^l, about two hundred to three hundred,

although females were imported to preserve them."

   Of the 4th West Indian Regiment placed, in 1819, in garrison at Gibraltar,

nearly all perished of pulmonary disease in fifteen months.
   The statistics of the mortality of negroes in the different States have clearly

shown the influence of climate. The farther they go north, the higher be-
comes the rate of mortality ; they seem to die of consumption, just like the
monkeys and lions in the Zoological Gardens.

It is difficult to determine the exact amount of influence exerted by race

in resisting particular diseases. It has, however, been shown that the negro
race on the West Coast of Africa, especially, is exempted from yellow fever,
and that a very small portion of African blood is sufficient to resist the

influence of this disease.

   All the dark races seem less liable to yellow fever than the white man.
Both the Red Indian and the Southern European are more exempt than

the Englishman.

Mr. Clarke;]; says, that when the yellow fever broke out at Sierra Leone

in 1837-8-9, 1847, and 1859, he never knew of a single negro or even of

a man of mixed blood being attacked. He also says, that in 1837 and 1839

small-pox broke out among the negroes, and disappeared at the same times

as the yellow fever appeared. With the plague the dark races are aflTected

far more than the white, being the reverse of the law with the yellow fever.

Dr. Nott contends that the predisposition to yellow fever is just in proportion

to the lightness of the skin ; and that with plague the reverse is the case.
   The Jewish race, and not the Chinese race, are, however, nearest to being

cosmopolitan. It is asserted that they live and thrive all over the.world. If,

however, we come to examine the evidence of this fact, we find that many

of the people reputed to be Jews have no claim whatever to that question-

able   honour                             such,  for instance,  as  the  many  reputed  cases  of  black  Jews.

man generally, makes an exception in favour of the Jewish race, and says

that this race has settled the question that one race is cosmopolitan.

The statistics which have been published respecting the Jews in different

countries seem to show that the Jew is subject to different physiological laws

from those of the people by whom he may be surrounded. This phenomenon
may, however, be explained by other physiological laws. M. Boudin supports

his views from the difference in the statistics of disease and death of the

Jews and the other colonists in Algeria. But the conditions of these two

are very different. The Jews have been in Algeria for a considerable time,
while the colonists are going there daily. Had M. Boudin proved that a

number of Jews and Frenchmen went to Algeria at the same time, and that

the Jews became more easily acclimatized, it might go some way towards

showing the advantage of the Jewish race over the Frenchman, if we could
not explain the phenomenon on other grounds. Had M. Boudin proved

satisfactorily that the Jew was cosmopolitan, we should not easily be in-

duced to admit that this was inexplicable by physiological laws. I do not

pretend to enter into any of the causes which may have enabled the Jew to

appear favoured ; but we must not hurriedly admit tliat there are excep-

tional laws in favour of any one race. On the same plea that M. Boudin

has claimed an exception in favour of the Jews, we may also advocate owe

on the part of the Gipsies. The chief cause, however, of the apparent

superiority of the Jews over some other races is the fact that they are a pure

race. All pure races support the influence of change better than mixed races.

The nomadic Arabs, as long as they remain pure, can also live in very differ-

ent temperatures and climates. The Chinese are also generally a pure race

and it is possible that the nearer the race approach the original type, the

greater power they have in enduring change of climate. But enduring

Achange of climate is not acclimatization.  process of acclimatization should

enable a race to perpetuate itself in a new region, without supplies of new

blood from its own region, and without, of course, mixing with the indigenous

races of the invaded country. The recorded historical migrations of nations

do not give us sufficient evidence to make us believe in different laws from

those which are in existence at this time.

I am fully sensible of the great difficulty there is at present of defining

the exact limits of the various ethnic centres. When I speak therefore of

the European centre, I would also observe that this region is not necessarily

confined to the portion of the earth we call Europe ; on the contrary, I

should include the whole of those original inhabitants of the Mediterranean,

such as the Phoenicians, as belonging to the European centre. The modern

Jews*, for instance, who are most probably lineal descendants of the old

Phoenician merchants, are vastly superior to any purely Asiatic race. Never

Wewas the Jew more calumniated than by saying that he is an Asiatic !

all know the distinctive characteristics of the various Asiatic races, and

nowhere do we find a people at all resembling the Jews. The only explana-

tion I have ever heard given of this contradiction is that by Mr. Burke.

That gentleman contends that there is a hierarchy not only in ethnic centres,

but similarly in their climates ; and that any race coming from an inferior

centre to a higher centre is thereby improved, other conditions being equal,

and provided of course that the change be not too violent. Thus he points

out the fact that the Jew has not degenerated in Europe, but has greatly

improved in spite of all disadvantages. He also very truly observes, that

no one will contend that the climate of Palestine will suit an Englishman as

   * I do not include in this term the fair-haired, blue-eyed race found in the Levant, and

who are called Jews by Mr. Lajard and Dr. Bsddoe.

                                                                           1

Wethat ©f England suits a Jew.  have, however, evidence to show that the
--climate of Palestine does not suit a Jew a pretty good test that it is not his

native land. Many writers have noticed this; but I will only quote the im-

partial evidence of Eliot Warburton, who says*, "It is a curious but well-

ascertained fact that the Jews do not multiply at present in the native city

of their race ; few children attain to puberty, and the mortality altogether is
so great, that the constant reinforcements from Europe scarcely maintain the

average population."

The great majority of the Jewish race is in Europe. The entire number of

Jews, according to M. Boudin, is computed to be four millions three hundred

thousand ; and of these there are in Europe three millions six hundred thou-
sand, in Africa four hundred and fifty thousand, in Asia two hundred thou-

sand, America forty-eight thousand, and in Australia two thousand. Thus,

more than three-fourths of the entire number of Jews are in Europe, and

^only a fraction of in Asia. Mr. Burke conceives it possible that even the

Negro might be improved in the long run by coming to Europe under

favourable circumstances, " though this," says Mr. Burke, " would not apply

to the lower and unprogressive portions of the type, but to its advancing

sections." Our researches have rather tended to show, however, that

although they may not degenerate like Europeans going to an inferior

centre, they still are incapable of becoming acclimatized anywhere iu

WeEurope, and we much doubt if even out of Africa.           are unable, in the

present state of our science, to do more than see that ethnic centres d& exist,

tvithout being able to define their exact limits or their number.

In a former part of this paper I incidentally touched on the influence of

the mind in conquering physical agents. Maltebrun, Goethe, and Kant

have all given their testimony in favour of the power of the mind in resisting

disease. And this subject becomes important with reference to some statis-

tical facts respecting the difference in mortality between the officers and

men in India and elsewhere. Thus, with bowel-complaints in India, there

were in Bengal only three more deaths of European officers in a ratio of

ten thousand than in the same number of sepoys ; and in Madras eighteen
fewer deaths took place than in a similar number of sepoysf. Dr. Cameron

also affirms that the ravages of cholera did not affect the officers or other

Europeans in a like grade of life ; and he says that " the small mortality

amongst the officers of European regiments in Ceylon is very remarkable J."
Indeed, the whole medical records teem with instances of the influences

whicii the mind possesses in the production and removal of disease. It is

possible that much may be done to enable our troops to exist in India and else-

where by attention to the necessity that exists for mental as well as physical

exercise. Much might also be efl'ected were the differences of temperaments

more studied, and a judicious selection made of those fitted for hot, and those

for cold, climates.

   Two questions were asked Sir Ranald Martin, who is a great advocate for

hill-stations and for other reforms in the army; his answers§ are important.

" 1st. But is there no such thing as acclimatization?
" A. No, I believe not.
" 2nd. Physically, you do not think that acclimatization exists ?
" A. I think it does not."

These answers express the result of my own inquiries into this subject.

I have endeavoured to show from such facts as are at hand that man

cannot be rapidly displaced from one region and located in another without

injury. This must be admitted ; but it may be answered that it can be done

--slowly that if it cannot be done in one generation, it may be done in time.

Now it is quite evident that " time is no agent " in this case ; and unless there

is some sign of acclimatization in one generation, there is no such process.

A race may be living and flourishing in its own centre, but sometimes a very

slight change into a new region will produce the most disastrous results.
The Spaniards, for instance, cannot with impunity migrate into the new re-
gion on the opposite coast. In Egypt we see exemplified perhaps the most
remarkable proof of what I have stated. From time immemorial Egypt has
been ruled by foreign races, but not one has left any descendants. Mr. War-

--burton* has briefly expressed himself on this point in these words: " The

Turk never or rarely intermarries with Egyptians, and it is a well-known fact
that children born of other women in this country rapidly degenerate or die ;
there are few indigenous Turks in Egypt. Through the long reign of the
Mamelukes there was not one instance, I believe, of a son succeeding to his
father's power and possessions." These Mamelukes were generally adopted ·
Circassian slaves, who adopted others in their turn; and they had plenty of
Circassian women imported to perpetuate their race, but witli no better results
than have met all other invaders. Of the English residents at Cairo the
same writer observes, '* The English seem to succumb, for the most part,
to the fatal influence of this voluptuous climate, and, with some admirable
 exceptions, do little credit to the proud character of their country."

    The English also, when sent to any part of the Mediterranean, suff"er far
 more than in England. It has been proposed to locate British troops at these
 stations for a time, before they proceed to India. The caution that a warm
 climate requires change of habits might do good ; but we strongly suspect

 that if troops were located in the Mediterranean for a few years before pro-
 ceeding to India, the mortality would be far higher when they arrived there.
 If also, with a view of colonizing India, we were to send a colony, for a ge-

 neration or more, to dwell in the Mediterranean, we should get a degenerate
 race who would have few of the qualities of the British race. Wherever we
 go, we may apply the question in a similar manner. The distribution of
 mankind over the globe is the result of law, order and harmony, and not of
 mere chance and accidental circumstances, as too many would have us
 believe. From the earliest dawn of history, races of men existed very much
 as they do now, and in the same locations. Jewish history, both monumental
 and written, tells us that the Jew has not changed for the last three thousand
 years; and the same is the case with all other races who have kept their blood

 pure. I would therefore say that it is as difficult to plant a race out of its

 own centre, as it is to extinguish any race without driving it from its natural
 centre. The Tasmanians and American Indians have both been extinguished

 by removal from their native soil; and this is nearly the only process yet
 discovered of extinguishing any race of man. The object of this paper,

 however, is simply to suggest to ethnologists and geographers the necessity

 of a further investigation of the important question of acclimatization.

ON THE GAUGING OF yV^ATER BY TRIANGULAR NOTCHES. 151

On Experiments on the Gauging of Watei' by Triangular Notches. By
  James Thomson, M.A., Professor of Civil Engineering, Queen's

    College, Belfast.

In 1858 I presented to the Association an interim Report on the new me-

thod which I had proposed for the gauging of flowing water by triangular (or

V-siiaped) notches, in vertical plates, instead of the rectangular notches, with

level bottom and upright sides, in ordinary use. I there pointed out that the

ordinary rectangular notches, although for many purposes suitable and con-

venient, are but ill adapted for the measurement of very variable quantities

of water, such as commonly occur to the engineer to be gauged in rivers and

streams ; because, if the rectangular notch be made wide enough to allow the

water to pass through it in flood times, it must be so wide that for long

periods, in moderately dry weather, the water flows so shallow over its crest,

that its indications cannot be relied on. I showed that this objection would

be removed by the employment of triangular notches, because, in them, when

the quantity flowing is small, the flow is confined to a narrow and shallow

space, admitting of accurate measurement ; and as the quantity flowing

increases, the width and depth of the space occupied in the notch increase

both in the same ratio, and the space remains of the same form as before,

though increased in magnitude. I proposed that in cases in which it might

not be convenient to form a deep pool of quiet water at the upstream side of

the weir-board, the bottom of the channel of approach, when the triangular

notch is used, may be formed as a level floor, starting exactly from the ver-

tex of the notch, and extending both up stream and laterally so far as that

the water entering on it at its margin may be practically considered as still

water, of which the height of the surface above the vertex of the notch may

be measured in order to determine the quantity flowing. 1 indicated theo-

retic considerations which led to the anticipation that in the triangular

notch, both without and with the floor, the quantity flowing would be pro-

portional, or very nearly so, to the ^ power of the height of the still-water
surface above the vertex of the notch. As the result of moderately accurate

experiments which I had at that time been able to make on the flow in a right-

Qangled notch, without floor, I gave the formula Q=0'317 H^, where is the

Hquantity of water in cubic feet per minute, and                                                                       the head of water, as

measured vertically, in inches, from the still- water level of the pool down to

the vertex of the notch. This formula I submitted at that time tempo-

rarily, as being accurate enough for use for many ordinary practical pur»

poses for the measurement of water by notches similar to the one experi-

mented on, and for quantities of water limited to nearly the same range as

those in the experiments (from about two to ten cubic feet per minute), but

as being subject to amendment by future experiments which might be of

greater accuracy, and might extend over a wider range of quantities of water.

   Having been requested by the General Committee of the Association to

continue my experiments on this subject, with a grant placed at my dis-

posal for the purpose, 1 have, in the course of last summer and of the present
summer, devoted much time to the carrying out of more extended and more

accurate experiments. The results which I have now obtained are highly
satisfactory. I am confident of their being very accurate. 1 find them to

be in close accordance with the law which had been indicated by theoretical

considerations                                                             and  I  am satisfied that  the  new system  of  gauging,  now by
                                                                        ;

these experiments made completely ready for general application, will prove to

be of great practical utility, and will aff'ord, for a large class of cases, import-

--ant advantages over the ordinary method for such cases, especially, as the

very varying flows of rivers and streams.

   The experiments were made in the open air, in a field adjacent to a corn-
mill belonging to Mr. Henry Neeson, in Carr's Glen, near Belfast. The

water-supply was obtained from the course leading to the water-wheel of the

mill, and means were arranged to allow of a regula^pd supply, variable at plea-

sure, being drawn from that course to flow into a pond, in one side of which the

weir-board with the experimental notcli was inserted. The inflowing stream

was so screened from the part of the pond next the gauge-notch, as to prevent

any sensible agitation being propagated from it to the notch, or to the place

where the water level was measured. For measuring the water level, a vertical

slide-wand of wood was used, with the bottom end cut to

the form of a hook (as shown in the marginal figure), the

point of which was a small level surface of about one-

eighth of an inch square. This point of the hook, by

being brought up to the surface of the water from below,

gave a very accurate means for determining the water

level, or its rise or fall, which could be read oflF by an

index mark near the top of the wand, sliding in contact

with the edge of a scale of inches on a fixed framing which

carried the wand.

By other experimenters a sharp-pointed hook, like a

fishing-hook, has sometimes, especially of late, been used

for the same purpose, and such a hook affords very accu- .   r ti

rate indications. The result of my experience, however, jg^^^ii^^S^^^f^^
leads me to incline to prefer something larger than the

sharp-pointed hook, and capable of producing an effect on

the water surface more easily seen than that of a sharp-pointed hook ; and
on the whole I would recommend a level line like a knife-edge, which might

be from one-eighth to half an inch long, in preference either to a blunt point

with level top or a sharp point. The blunt point which I used was so small,

however, as to suit very perfectly. If the point be too large, it holds the

water up too much on its top as the water in the pond descends, and makes

too deep a pit in the surface as the water ascends and begins to flow
over it. The knife-edge would be free from this kind of action, and would,

I conceive, serve every purpose perfectly, except when the water has a sen-

sible velocity of flow past the hook, and in that case, perhaps, the sharp point,

like that of a fishing-hook, might be best.

To afi"ord the means for keeping the water surface during an experiment

exactly at a constant level, as indicated by the point of the wooden hook, a
small outlet waste-sluice was fitted in the weir-board. The quantity of water

admitted to the pond was always adjusted so as to be slightly in excess of

that required to maintain the water level in the pond at the height at
which the hook was fixed for that experiment. Then a person lying

down, so as to get a close view of the contact of the water surface with

the point of the hook, worked this little waste or regulating sluice, so as to
maintain the water level constantly coincident with the point of the hook.

   The water issuing from the experimental notch was caught in a long trough,
which conveyed it forward with slight declivity, so as to be about seven or
eight feet above the ground further down the hill-side, where two large

measuring-barrels were placed side by side at about six feet distance apart
from centre to centre. Across and underneath the end of the long trough

just mentioned, a tilting-trough 6 feet long was placed, and it was connected at

its middle with the end of the long trough by a leather flexible joint, in such
a way that it would receive the whole of the water without loss, and convey

it at pleasure to either of the barrels, according as it was tilted to one side

or the other.
     ON THE GAUGING OF WATER BY TRIANGULAR NOTCHES. 155

    Each barrel had a valve in the bottom, covering an aperture six inches
square, and the valve could be opened at pleasure, and was capable of
emptying the barrel very speedily. The capacity of the two barrels jointly
was about 230 gallons, and. their content up to marks fixed near the top for
the purpose of the experiments was accurately ascertained by gaugings
repeated several times with two- or four-gallon measures with narrow necks.

   By tilting the small trough so as to deliver the water alternately into the

one barrel and the other, and emptying each barrel by its valve while the other
was filling, the process of measuring the flowing water could be accurately
carried on for as long time as might be desired. With this apparatus, quan-
tities of water up to about 38 cubic feet per minute could be measured with
very satisfactory accuracy.

   The experiments of which I have now to report the results were made on
two widths of notches in vertical plane surfaces. The notches were accu-

rately formed in thin sheet iron, and were fixed so as to present next the
water in the pond a plane surface, continuous with that of the weir-board.

   The one notch was right-angled, with its sides sloping at 45° with the
horizon, so that its horizontal width was twice its depth. The other notch
had its sides each sloping two horizontal to one vertical, so that its horizontal
width was four times its depth.

   In each case experiments were made both on the simple notch without a
floor, and on the same notch with a level floor starting from its vertex, and
extending for a considerable distance both up stream and laterally. The
floor extended about 2 feet on each side of the centre of the notch, and about
2g feet in the direction up stream, and this size was sufficient to allow the

--water to enter on it with only a very slow motion so slow as to be quite

unimportant. The height of the water surface above the vertex of the
notch was measured by the sliding hook at a place outside the floor, where
the water of the pond was deep and still.

   The principal results of the experiments on the flow of the water in the
right-angled notch without floor are briefly given in the annexed table, the

                      H.
--154 REPORT 1861.

from If cubic feet per minute to 39, the coefficient c renriains almost abso-
lutely constant; and thus the theoretic anticipation that the quantity should
be proportional, or very nearly so, to the f power of the depth is fully con-
firmed by experiment. The mean of these six values of c is ·3064- ; but, being

inclined to give rather more weight, in the determination of the coefficient
as to its amount, to some of the experiments made this year than to those of

last year, I adopt "305 as the coefficient, so that the formula for the right-

angled notch without floor will be

                        Q=-305 nt

My experiments on the right-angled notch with the level floor, fitted as

already described, comprised the flow of water for depths of 2, 3, 4, 5, and

6 inches. They indicate no variation in the value of c for different depths

of the water, but what may be attributed to the slight errors of observation.

The  mean  value which  they show for c is  '308                        and  as  this  differs so little
                                                                     ;

from that in the formula for the same notch without the floor, and as the

difference is within the limits of the errors of observation, and because some

consecutive experiments, made without and with the floor, indicated no

change of the coefficient on the insertion of the floor, I would say that the

experiments prove that, with the right-angled notch, the introduction of the

floor produces scarcely any increase or diminution on the quantity flowing for
any given depth, but do not show what the amount of any such small increase

or diminution may be, and I would give the formula

                        Q=-305 H*

as sufficiently accurate for use in both cases. The experiments in both
cases were made with care, and are without doubt of very satisfactory accu-

racy ; but those for the notch without the floor are, I consider, slightly the

more accurate of the two sets.
   The experiments with the notch with edges sloping two horizontal to one

vertical showed an altered feature in the flow of the issuing vein as com-
pared with the flow of the vein issuing from the right-angled notch. The
edges of the vein, on issuing from the notch with slopes two to one, had
a great tendency to cling to the outside of the iron notch and weir-board,
while the portions of the vein issuing at the deeper parts of the notch would
shoot out and fall clear of the weir-board. Thus, the vein of water assumed
the appearance of a transparent bell, as of glass, or rather of the half of
a bell closed in on one side by the weir-board and enclosing air. Some
of this air was usually carried away in bulibles by the stream at bottom,
and the remainder continued shut up by the bell of water, and existing under
slightly less than atmospheric pressure. The diminution of pressure of the
enclosed air was manifested by the sides of the bell being drawn in towards
one anotlier, and sometimes even drawn together, so as to collapse with
one another at their edges which clung to the outside of the weir-board.

On the full atmospheric pressure being admitted, by the insertion of a knife

into the bell of falling water, the collapsed sides would instantly spring out
again. The vein of water did not always form itself into the bell ; and when
the bell was formed, the tendency to the withdrawal of air in bubbles was

not constant, but was subject to various casual influences. Now it evidently

could not be supposed that the formation of the bell and the diminution of
the pressure of the confined air could occur as described without producing
some irregular influences on the quantity flowing through the notch for any
particular depth of flow, and this circumstance must detract more or less
from the value of the wider notches as means for gauging water in compa-
rison with the right-angled notch with edges inclined at 45° with the hori-
     ON THE GAUGING OF WATER BY TRIANGULAR NOTCHES. 155

zon. I therefore made numerous experiments to determine what might be
the amount of the ordinary or of the greatest effect due to the diminution
of pressure of the air within the bell. I usually failed to meet with any per-
ceptible alteration in the quantity flowing due to this cause, but sometimes
the quantity seemed to be increased by some small fraction, such as one, or
perhaps two, per cent. On the whole, then, I do not think that this circum-
stance need prevent the use, for many practical purposes, of notches of any

desired width for a given depth.

  My experiments give as the formula for the notch, with slopes of two

horizontal to one vertical, and without the floor,

                                 Q=0-636 H^

and for the same notch, with the horizontal floor at the level of its vertex,

                                Q=0-628 nt

In all the experiments from which these formulas are derived, the bell of
falling water was kept open by the insertion of a knife or strip of iron, so

as to admit the atmospheric pressure to the interior. The quantity flowing
at various depths was not far from being proportional to the f power of the

depth, but it appeared that the coefficient in the formula increased slightly
for very small depths, such as one or two inches. For instance, in the notch
with slopes 2 to 1 without the floor, the coefficient for the depth of two

inches came out experimentally O-G^Q, instead of 0'636, which appeared to
be very correctly its amount for four inches' depth. It is possible that the
deviation from proportionality to the f power of the depth, which in this
notch has appeared to be greater than in the right-angled notch, may be
due partly to small errors in the experiments on this notch, and partly to the
clinging of the falling vein of water to the outside of the notch, which would
evidently produce a much greater proportionate eff'ect on the very small
flows than on great flows. The special purpose for which the wide notches
have been proposed is to serve for the measurement of wide rivers or streams
in cases in which it would be inconvenient or impracticable to dam them up
deep enough to effect their flow through a right-angled notch. In such
cases I would now further propose that, instead of a single wide notch, two,
three, or more right-angled notches might be formed side by side in the
same weir-board, with their vertices at the same level, as shown in the an-

nexed figure. In cases in which this method may be selected, the personsr
using It, or making comparisons of gaugings obtained by it, will have the

satisfaction of being concerned with only a single standard form of gauge-

fiotch throughout the investigation in which they may be engaged.
   By comparison of the formulas given above for the flows through the two

notches experimented on, of which one is twice as wide for a given depth
as the other, it will be seen that in the formula for the wider notch the co-
efficient -636 is rather more than double the coefficient -305 in the other.
Ihis indicates that as the width of a notch, considered as variable, increases
trom that of a right-angled notch upwards, the quantity of water flowing
                              :

156 REPORT-- 1861.

increases somewhat more rapidly than the width of the notch for a given depth.
Now, it is to be observed that the contraction of the stream issuing from an
orifice open above in a vertical plate is of two distinct kinds at different parts
round the surface of the vein. One of these kinds is the contraction at the
places where the water shoots off from the edges of the plate. The curved

surface of the fluid leaving the plate is necessarily tangential with the surface
of the plate along which the water has been flowing, as an infinite force

would be required to divert any moving particle suddenly out of its previous
course*. The other kind of contraction in orifices open above consists in
the sinking of the upper surface, which begins gradually within the pond or
reservoir, and continues after the water has passed the orifice. These two
contractions come into play in very difl'erent degrees, according as the notch
(whether triangular, rectangular, or with curved edges) is made deep and
narrow, or wide and shallow. From considerations of the kind here briefly
touched upon, I would not be disposed to expect theoretically that the coeffi-
cient c for the formula for Y-shaped notches should be at all truly proportional
to the horizontal width of the orifice for a given depth ; and the experi-
mental results last referred to are in accordance with this supposition. I
would, however, think that, from the experimental determination now arrived
at, of the coefficient for a notch so wide as four times its depth, we might
very safely, or without danger of falling into important error, pass on to
notches wider in any degree, by simply increasing the coefficient in the same
ratio as the width of the notch for a given depth is increased.

           --Appendix. April 1862.

    With reference to the comparison made, in the concluding sentences of the
foregoing Report, between tiie quantities of water which, for any given depth
of flow, are discharged by notches of different widths, and to the opinion
there expressed, that we might, without danger of falling into important
error, pass from the experimental determination of the coefficient for a
notch so wide as four times its depth, to the employment of notches wider in
any degree, by simply increasing the coefficient in the same ratio as the width
of the notch for a given depth is increased, I now wish to add an investi-
gation since made, which confirms that opinion, and extends the determina-

tion of the discharge, beyond the notches experimented on, to notches of any
widths great in proportion to their depths. This investigation is founded on
the formula for the flow of water in rectangular notches obtained from ela-
borate and careful experiments made on a very large scale by Mr. James B.
Francis, in his capacity as engineer to the Water-power Corporations at
Lowell, Massachusetts, and described in a work by him, entitled ' Lowell
Hydraulic Experiments,' Boston, }855f. That formula, for either the case
in which there are no end-contractions of the vein, or for that in which the
length of the weir is great in proportion to the depth of the water over its
crest, and the flow over a portion of its length not extending to either end is

alone considered, is

           Qj=3-33L,H^t                                            (1)

on hydrodynamics. Even MM. Poncelet and Lesbros, in their dehncations of the forms

of veins of water issuing from orifices in thin jolates, after elaborate measurements of those

forms, represent the surface of the fluid as making a shai-p angle with the plate in leaving

its edge.  f The formida is to be found at page 133 of that work.

    It is to be understood that, in cases to which this formula is applicable,

the weir has a vertical face on the upstream side, terminating at top in a

air, as if the weir were a vertical thin plate.                                                           B C be

158 REPORT 1861.

   As to the confidence which may be placed in this formula, I think it clear

that, for the case in which the notch is so wide, or, what is the same, the slopes

of its edges are so slight, that the water may flow over each infinitely small

element of the length of its crest without being sensibly influenced in quan-
tity by lateral contraction arising from the inclination of the edges, the for-

mula may be relied on as having all the accuracy of the Lowell formula
from which it has been derived ; and I would suppose that when the notch is
of such width as to have slopes of about four or five to one, or when it is of

any greater width whatever, the deviation from accuracy in consequence of
lateral contraction might safely be neglected as being practically unimportant

or inappreciable.
    This formula for wide notches bears very satisfactorily a comparison with

the formulas obtained experimentally for narrower notches, as described in

the foregoing Report. For slopes of one to one the formula was Q=*305 H'-*,

and for slopes of two to one the formula was Q=*636 H*. To compare
these with the one now deduced for any very slight slopes, we may express

them thus :

For slopes of 1 to 1                               Q=-305»tH^
                                                   Q=-S18?wH^
And for slopes of 2 to 1
                                                                                        s
While for any very slight slopes, or for any very
   wide notches, the formula now deduced from      Q=-320mH.
    the Lowell one is

   The very slight increase from '318 to '320 here shown in passing from

the experimental formula for notches with slopes of two to one, to notches

--wider in any degree that slight change, too, being in the right direction,

as is indicated by the increase from -305 to '318 in passing from slopes of

--one to one, to slopes of two to one gives a verification of the concluding

remarks in the foregoing Report ; and this may serve to induce confidence
in the application in practice of the formula now oflTered for wide notches.

Report on Field Experiments and Laboratory Researches on the Con-

   stituents of Manures essential to cultivated Crops. i?t/ Dr. Augustus
   VoELCKER, Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.

In a Report read at the Aberdeen meeting, and subsequently printed in the
' Transactions of the British As-sociation,' will be found recorded a number
of field experiments on turnips and on wheat. Siiflilar experiments upon
these two crops have since been continued from year to year, and a new
series of field experiments has been undertaken on the growth of barley.

   In connexion with these field trials I have made numerous laboratory
experiments on the solubility of the various forms and conditions in which
phosphate of lime is likely to be presented to growing plants, and have
likewise studied to some extent the influence of ammoniacal salts and a few
other saline combinations on the solubility of the various forms in which
phosphate of lime occurs in recent and fossil bones, in apatite, and other

phosphatic materials.

   The present Report will comprehend two sections. In the first I shall

give the results of my field experiments on turnips, wheat, and barley ; in

the second section reference will be made to the solubility of phosphatic

materials in various saline liquids.

       FIELD EXPERIMENTS ON MANURE CONSTITUENTS. 159

                     1st Part : Field Experiments.

    Before giving an account of recent experiments on turnips, wheat, and

barley, not incorporated in the Report for 1859, it may appear desirable
briefly to state the chief deductions that naturally flow from my previous

experiments, extending over five seasons.

   In these experiments I found that, amongst other particulars
   1. Ammoniacal salts, such as sulphate of ammonia, used alone, had a
decidedly injurious effect upon the turnip crop, even when used in small

quantities.

   2. Purely ammoniacal manures applied to swedes at first checked the
growth of the plant, and had ultimately no beneficial effect on the crop,

either alone or in conjunction with phosphates.

3. Phosphates used alone, but in a readily available condition, produced a

larger increase in the yield of turnips than mixtures of phosphates with

ammoniacal matters.

4. Sulphates of potash and soda had no decided effect on turnips.

5- Sulphate of lime likewise was ineffective as a manure for turnips on the

soil on which the experiments were tried.

   6. On the other hand, ammoniacal manures, so inefficacious for root-crops,

produced a considerable increase in the yield of wheat, grown on a soil

similar to that of the experimental turnip-field.

   7. Nitrate of soda, applied by itself, and still more soWn conjunction with

common salt, gave a very large increase per acre, both in straw and corn.

These are the principal results of previous field trials. Chemico-agri-

cuUural experiments, however, are of little or no practical utility, unless

they are continued I'rom year to year for a long period, and tried on a variety

of soils, in good and in bad seasons, in a manner which allows us, if not to

eliminate, yet clearly to recognize the disturbing influences of climate, sea-

son, condition of soils, and other circumstances which often affect the produce

Ain a higher degree than the manures on which we experiment.       single

field experiment is as likely to lead us in a wrong as in a right direction.

I have therefore continued field experiments similar to those already re-

ported upon, and proceed with an account of field trials on turnips made in

1859.

       Field Experiments on Swedish Turnips made in 1 859.

The field selected for experimental trials in 1859 was in tolerably good

condition. It bore clover in 1857, and wheat in 1858. The soil is mode-

Arately deep and well drained.  portion of the soil, taken from a large

sample from different parts of the field, was submitted to analysis, and the

following results obtained :

160 REPORT 1861.

    This soil contained hardly any sand that can be separated by the mechanical
process of washing and decantation. It contains, like most of the soils on
our farm, an appreciable quantity of sulphate of lime and also of phosphoric

acid. It is not so rich in carbonate of lime as many others of our fields, and

is rich enough in clay to be called a good agricultural clay.

   An acre of this land was divided into 20 parts. The difFerent manures,

swedes) drilled on the following day. The distance between the drills was
22 inches ; the plants were singled out 12 inches apart. The portion of the
field on which the experiments were tried was left unmanured.

therefore left in the field until the 8th of December, when the crop was

taken up. The roots were topped and tailed and cleaned, and the whole

produce of each plat then carefully weighed, with the following results :

    In looking over the list of the different manures employed in these experi-

ments, it will be noticed, in the first place, that certain simple salts which
commonly enter into the composition of artificial manures have been used

separately. It is not likely that we shall ever understand the action of com-
plicated manures if we do not carefully study the separate effect of their
component parts on vegetation. For this reason one plot was manured with
sulphate of ammonia, another with sulphate of lime, a third with sulphate of

potash, a fourth with chloride of sodium, and, finally, one with nitrate of soda.

   In the next place, we have in Plot 17 phosphates chiefly in a soluble con-
dition, and free from organic matter or anything else but sulpliate of lime,
which is necessarily produced when bone-ash is treated with sulphuric acid.

In another plot (No. 18) we have the same materials in conjunction with
sulphate of ammonia ; and in No. 20 we have them united with nitrate of
soda. Then with respect to the form in which the nitrogen is applied in

these experiments, I would observe that we find it in farm-yard manure,

partly as ready-formed ammonia, partly in the stage of semi-decomposed

nitrogenized organic matter. In sulphate of ammonia it exists of course as
a salt of ammonia; for nitrate of soda, v/e apply nitrogen in the shape of

nitric acid. In guano nitrogen exists, partly, only in tlie form of ammoniacal
salts,--the greater portion of nitrogen being present as uric acid and other

organic compounds, which readily yield ammonia on decomposition. And

lastly, we have all these different forms in which nitrogen can be conveniently

applied to the land combined, together with phosphates, in the turnip manure.

   The results of these experiments, though unsatisfactory in some respects,

are nevertheless interesting and suggestive in others, and worthy of some
comments.

In comparing the weight of roots from these two plots, it would appear

that the additional quantity of supersulphate has had rather an injurious than a

Webeneficial eifect.  must, however, not entertain such a view, although

the experiments before us appear to favour it ; for the common experience

of farmers is, that even well-manured land yields a better crop of swedes when

the seed is drilled in with 2 or 3 cwt. of superphosphate of lime. I have

reason for believing that on plot No. 1 more roots were grown than on

plot No. 2 ; for I find the land on one side of the experimental plots yielded

17 tons 6 cwt. 1 qr. 20 lbs. per acre, and on the other side it gave 17 tons

18 cwt. 24? lbs. per acre. This land was manured with about 15 tons of

farmyard manure and 3 cwt. of superphosphate per acre. This produce

agrees well with the weight of the roots on the second plot, manured with

dung and superphosphate. Still we have a difference of nearly 12 cwt. of

roots in the two plots adjoining the experimental lots ; and ought, therefore,

to remember that the natural variations of the land, and other purely acci-

dental circumstances, may readily give a difference in the produce of differ-

ent portions of land which have been treated in every respect alike. Indeed,

if the difference in the produce does not amount to more than 1 ton or even

I5 ton, I fear we cannot do much with the results. It certainly would be

rash to lay stress on such differences, and to use them as arguments in proving

or denying the efficacy of certain manuring matters.

Plots 3, 4, and 5. Manured with superphosphate of lime.

The superphosphate used in these experiments had the following composi-

tions :

This superphosphate was chiefly made from bone-ash, and contained but

Wevery little nitrogen.  have thus here another proof that a good crop of

roots can be obtained on clay land with superphosphate alone, containing but

little nitrogenized or other organic matters.

Plot 7. Manured with Peruvian guano and superphosphate.

Plot 8. Manured with Peruvian guano.

The difference in the yield of these two plots is not more than 6 cwt., which

is too insignificant to decide the question whether in the case before us

Peruvian guano alone had a better effect upon the crop than the mixture of

superphosphate and guano. In former years, however, I have found that

Peruvian guano produced not nearly so great an increase as superphosphate

alone, or a mixture of superphospjiate and guano. There are, no doubt,

soils for which guano is the mqst- profitable manure, even for root-crops;

but this is rather the exception, and not the rule.

liad a slight beneficial effect, which was not the case in the experiments

which I tried on other soils in past years.

   Plots 9 and 12. Manured with sulphate of ammonia.
   The sulphate of ammonia used on Plot 12 has had a better effect on
swedes than in former years. The effect, however, was not great when com-

pared with that produced by phosphatic manures.
   Plot 11. Manured with 3 cwt. of fine bone-dust.

   Bone-dust, as might have been anticipated, gave a considerable increase.

The bone-dust used in this experiment was very fine, it having been specially

reduced to a coarse meal. On analysis it was found to consist of

   Plot 14. Manured with 1 cwt. of nitrate of soda.
   I am not aware of any accurate experiments in which nitrate of soda has
been used by itself for turnips. The effect which so small a quantity as

1 cwt. of nitrate of soda produced on the crop was decidedly beneficial, for

it will be seen that as large a produce was obtained with 1 cwt. of nitrate of

soda as with 3 cwt. of fine bone-dust. This result is certainly encouraging,
and suggests a series of trials with nitrate of soda upon root-crops. Tlie

nitrate should be used in such trials by itself, as well as in conjunction with

superphosphate or bones.

   The nitrate of soda used in this experiment was a good sample, which

contained 95-68 per cent, of the pure salt.

   Plot 16. Manured with 3 cwt. of common salt.
   Common salt, it will appear, has had little or no effect in this experiment
but it does not follow that it may not be beneficially applied to swedes, in

conjunction with phosphatic fertilizers.

   Plot 17. Manured with 3 cwt. of dissolved bone-ash.
   In preparing this manure, 100 lbs. of good commercial bone-ash were
mixed with 70 lbs. of brown sulphuric acid ; and after some time this mixture
was dried up with 50 lbs. of sulphate of lime. By this means an excellent
superphosphate was obtained, aswill be seen by the following analysis. The
manure, being made of bone-ash, did not contain any ammoniacal salts nor

appreciable quantities of nitrogen.

1(54 REPORT 1861.

   The result of this plot affords another proof that a good crop of swedes
may be obtained nith a superphosphate in which all the pjiosphates are

rendered soluble, and which contains no nitrogenized matters.
   Plot 18. Manured with 3 cwt. of dissolved bone-ash and 1 cwt. of sulphate

of ammonia.
   In this experiment the addition of sulphate of ammonia to dissolved bone-

ash appears to have done no good whatever.
   Plot 19. Manured with 3 cwt. of sulphate of potash.

   The sulphate of potash used in this experiment was a good commercial
sulphate. It produced about the same increase as 2 cwt. of sulphate of
ammonia ; and, in comparison to the effect which phosphatic manures pro-
duced, must be considered as a manuring constituent which did not seem to
be required on the soil on which the experiments were tried.

    Plot 20. Manured with 3 cwt. of dissolved bone-ash and 1 cwt. of nitrate

of soda.

    The addition of nitrate of soda to the dissolved bone-ash gave only 14 cwt.

--more roots than the dissolved bone-ash used by itself a quantity far too small

to be regarded as a proof that nitrate of soda increased the efficacy of the

dissolved bone-ash. From the preceding experiments I think we may safely
draw the following conclusions :

    1. They point out in the most decided manner the great superiority of
phosphatic matters as manuring constituents for root-crops.

     2. It appears that a sufficient quantity of soluble phosphates renders other
 fertilizing matters superfluous on soils that have a constitution similar to that
 of the experimental field.

    3. Ammoniacal salts do not appear to have any specific effect on the

 turnip-crop.

     4. Alkaline chlorides and sulphates produced no effect.
    5. Nitrate of soda had a beneficial effect upon the turnips.
     6. Sulphate of lime was inefficacious as a fertilizer for swedes in the ex-

 perimental field.

                                Wheat Expenments made iti 1 860.

    The field on which the experiments were tried is quite level. It contains
 numerous fragments of oolitic limestones, no sand, and a large proportion of
 clay. The depth of the cultivated soil is about 9 inciies on an average.
 The surface soil was well cultivated; it passes by degrees into limestone-
 rubble mixed with clay, and then rests on the great oolite limestone-rock.

 Two acres of this field were accurately divided into 8 plots, measuring l of

 an acre each.

     Plot 1 was manured with 4 cwt. of wheat manure per acre, specially pre-
 pared, being a mixed mineral and ammoniacal manure ; cost £1 125. per acre.

     Plot 2 was manured with 2|^ cwt. of Peruvian guano per acre; cost£l I2s.6cf.
     Plot 3 was manured with 1| cwt. of nitrate of soda; cost £1 105. per acre.

    Plot 4 was manured with 1^ cwt. of nitrate of soda and 3 cwt. of common

 salt ; cost £1 135. per acre.

    Plot 5 was manured with 3 cwt. of common salt per acre ; cost 3*.

     Plot 7 was manured with 2 cwt. of sulphate of ammonia ; cost £1 165. per

     Plot 8 was manured with 32 bushels of soot per acre ; cost IBs.
     These manures were all sifted through a fine sieve and mixed with coal-
  ashes, so as to obtain, for the sake of better distribution, 20 bushels of the
  mixture. This was sown by broadcast distribution, on the 27th March, 1860.

         FIELD EXPERIMENTS ON MANURE CONSTITUENTS. 165

   The wheat dressed with nitrate of soda, and that dressed with nitrate of
foda and salt, began to show the effects of these dressings four days after
their application^ by a much deeper green colour than could be observed on

any of tiie other plots. After a week's time the wheat on the plot dressed
with sulphate of ammonia, next to the plot manured with guano, assumed
a darker green colour; and lastly, the wheat on plot No. 1 turned darker
green. There was a marked difference of the plots 5 and 6, dressed with salt
and left unmanured, and the rest of the experimental plots. The nitrate of
soda plots, throughout the growing season, looked more luxuriant and darker
green than the rest ; and the wheat here was rather taller than on the other

plots. On plot 6, manured with salt, the wheat was shorter in the straw than

on plot 5, where no manure was applied. The wheat-crop was reaped in the
last week of August, and thrashed out on the 27th of September, 1860.

   The guano used as a top-dressing was genuine Peruvian guano of best

quality.

   The nitrate of soda contained 95| per cent, of pure nitrate.
   In the commercial sulphate of ammonia I found 96^ per cent, of pure
sulphate, and in the soot 2i per cent of ammonia.

    This tabular statement of results suggests the following remarks :

   1. The natural produce of this field, it will be seen, amounted to nearly
34 bushels. The grain on all plots was lighter than it is usually, and weighed

only 59 lbs. per bushel.
   2. Nitrate of soda and salt produced the greatest increase in grain and

--straw a result well corresponding with the results obtained in 1859. In

grain we have an increase of 13 bushels per acre, and in straw an increase
of 12 cwt. 3 qrs. 4 lbs., upon the unmanured portion of the field.

    This large increase was obtained with an expenditure of £1 13*. per acre

an outlay which, even at a lower market-price of wheat, paid excellent interest.
    3. Nitrate of soda applied by itself was not quite so beneficial, but still

gave a large increase both of grain and straw.

   4. Chloride of sodium, or common salt, on the other hand, hardly increased

the yield in grain, and slightly reduced the yield in straw.

   Common salt certainly has the eff'ect of checking the growth of wheat, and

is therefore frequently employed in cases in Avhich the wheat is too luxuriant
or, as it is called by farmers, too proud-looking. Such wheat has a tendency
to fall down before the grain is quite ripe, especially if the season happens to

be wet and stormy. Common salt is used by farmers for the purpose of pre-

venting the laying of wheat, and is said to strengthen the straw. It does so,
not by supplying to the wheat-plant a constituent deficient in the soil, but by
retarding the abundant development of the halm of wheat and other cereals.

    5. Next to nitrate of soda, Peruvian guano was the most efficacious and
most economical manure for wheat. 2^ cwt. per acre gave an increase of
12 bushels of wheat over the unmanured portion, besides an increase of 9

cwt. of straw.

    6. 2 cwt. of sulphate of ammonia per acre, applied by itself, gave a larger
increase than 4 cwt. of a mixed mineral and ammoniacal manure, containing
less ammoniacal and more mineral compounds than the 2 cwt. of sulphate
of ammonia.

     Thus, the latter gave an increase of 10 bushels of grain and II cwt. of
straw, whilst the mixed mineral and ammoniacal manure gave only an increase
 of 8 bushels of grain and 6 cwt. of straw, in round numbers.

                       Field Experiments on Barley made in 1860.

   Precisely the same experiments as those made upon wheat were tried on

barley. Two acres of the barley-field were divided into plots of | of an acre

each, and the various top-dressings sown by manure distributor on the 25th

of April.

The soil of this field is considered a good barley soil. It is full of lime-

stone, gravel, and fragments of oolitic stones of larger size, and, like most

soils in the neighbourhood of Cirencester, contains much clay. On analysis

it gave

    These barley experiments, on the whole, gave results corresponding to the
results obtained in the wheat experiments. Thus, the plots dressed with
nitrate of soda gave the largest increase, and sulphate of ammonia used alone
gave a larger increase than the mixed mineral and ammoniacal manure.

   The results do not, it is true, exactly agree in all particulars ; but perfect

agreement cannot be expected in field-experiments.
   Thus, in the barley experiments, guano appears to have produced a less

favouraljle result than in the wheat experiments, whilst the mixed mineral

and ammoniacal manure appeared to be better adapted for barley than for

wheat.

   "Whether this was the case, or whether the apparent differences in the

effects of the same dressings on barley and wheat were due to differences in

the composition and condition of the soil of the experimental fields, I am

unable to decide.               -

--168 REPORT 1861.

   The preceding experiruents, I think, furnish convincing proofs that, through

the instrumentality of purely nitrogenous manures, the produce of our grain-

crops may be very considerably increased, whilst the same manures appear to
be of no beneficial effect upon root-crops, at least on soils similar in character

to those on which the experiments were made.
    In making this statement, it is not maintained that mineral matters are less

essential to cereals than to root-crops ; for I take it for granted thai no che-
mist or vegetable physiologist at the present time will consider the ash-
constituents of plants less essential for cereals than for turnips and other

root-crops. No amount of nitrogenous manure can replace these earthy

matters, which enter into the composition of all cultivated plants.

   But, at the same time, it is a matter of experience that on many soils no
reasonable amount of mineral fertilizing constituents will increase the yield
of wheat or barley, whilst on these soils a moderate amount of a purely
nitrogenous manure will contribute to a large increase in the amount of
corn which can be raised from the same soils.

    It is hardly necessary to say, that the larger increase, as a matter of course,

removes more mineral matter from a land dressed with an ammoniacal or purely
nitrogenous manure than from land not so treated ; nor can it be denied
that on sandy and naturally sterile soils the application of fertilizing materials
containingexclusivelynitrogen, in some form or theother.will tend to the rapid
exhaustion of such soils ; it is nevertheless a fact that the great majority of
English soils are so rich in mineral matters that no fear need be entertained
of the land becoming permanently deteriorated by the occasional use of
nitrogenous matters on wheat-soils.

    With respect to the combination in which nitrogen appears to be most
generally assimilated by plants, and to be most grateful to wheat and barley,

and probably to vegetation in general, I am of opinion that nitric acid is

by far the most usual form in which nitrogen is taken up by plants. Nitrates
certainly produce a more rapid and more energetic effect than ammoniacal
salts on all plants which are benefited by nitrogenous matters.

    Nitrates have been found, by Dr. Sullivan and by myself, in a great variety

of plants, and may be detected without much difficulty in everj' arable soil,
when a suflBciently large quantity of soil is operated upon. In porous lime-

stones, and in soils containing chalk and gravel, ammoniacal salts appear to
be readily transformed into nitrates; hence the constant presence of traces
of nitric acid in the limestones of buildings, and of the occurrence of nitrates
in more considerable quantities in the well-water of towns. During the
period of the most energetic growth of plants, that is, during the summer
season, the process of nitrification no doubt proceeds with greater rapidity
in the soil than during autumn and winter ; and, in all probability, the luxu?
riant growth of plants during summer is materially assisted by the greater
proportion. of nitrates in the soil. Ammoniacal salts certainly benefit vege-

tation, and so do nitrogenous organic matters, but it may be questioned

 whether these matters have not to be ultimately converted into nitrates
before they can be of real utility to vegetation. Taking into account all the

laborious experiments which have been made of late by Boussingault, by

De Ville, and Dr. Gilbert and Mr. Lawes, with respect to the assimilation

 of nitrogen by plants, and bearing in mind agricultural experience and the
 results of direct manuring experiments, I think we shall find

     1. That there is suflficient evidence for regarding the free nitrogen of the
 atmosphere as incapable of supplying plants with food M'hich they can utilize
 in forming albuminous matters.

    2. That nitrogenous organic matters, such as hoofs, horn, wool, hair, and
                                                             --

FIELD EXPERIMENTS ON MANURE CONSTITUENTS, 169

similar substances, are slow-acting fertilizers, which have to be transformed
into soluble combinations before they can benefit plants.

   3. That ammoniacal salts are more energetic fertilizing matters, which,
however, are fixed in the soil at first, and retained in it during the colder
periods of the j'ear, and which are gradually changed into nitrates and
rendered soluble during the most active period of plant-growth.

   4. That, in the shape of nitrates, nitrogen is not only the most active, but

also the most abundant and common combination from which plants derive

their nitrogen.

2nd Part : On the solubility of pJiosphate of lime in various forms of phos-

  phate of lime and phospliate of magnesia, in pure distilled water, and in

   various saline solutions.

Solubility of various phosphatic matters in distilled water.

The amount of phosphate of lime which water is capable of taking up

from different materials depends. amongst other circumstances, on the physical

condition of the materials.

Thus, hard crystalline phosphatic materials, even when finely powdered

and left a long time in contact with water, do not yield so much phosphate

of lime to water as more porous substances in a shorter period.

In the following experiments, a considerable excess of the finely powdered

materials was mixed with about half a gallon of cold distilled water, and

repeatedly shaken up from time to time and left in contact with the water

for a week, except otherwise stated. The clear liquid was then drawn off

Awith a siphon, and filtered perfectly clear.  pint was then evaporated to

dryness, the residue dissolved in as little hydrochloric acid as possible, then

precipitated with ammonia, and in some instances the precipitated phos-

phates were redissolved and thrown down a second time with ammonia.

In experimenting with phosphatic minerals, it is not sufficient merely to

evaporate the watery solution to dryness ; for, besides phosphate of lime,

water dissolves more or less carbonate of lime, magnesia, traces of alkalies,

&c., which, added to the weight of the phosphate of lime, in many instances

would give the latter far too high. In each case 2 pints of liquid were

evaporated separately, and the following results obtained :

    Shank-bones of ox, coarsely ground and long soaked in water before

the experiment was begun. This bone-dust was very hard and close in texture.

The first pint, which was evaporated to dryness and further treated as stated
above, was removed from the bone-dust after the water had been in contact for

3 days. After that time 1 pint contained -06 grs., or -48 grs. per gallon, of
phosphate of lime left for 12 days in contact with bone-dust; the 2nd pint

produced '10, or "80 per gallon.

   It has been noticed already some years ago, by Professor Wohler, that

Myrotten bones yield to water more phosphate of lime than fresh ones.

experiments fully confirm this observation, and they moreover show that

the more porous the bone, the more readily it yields phosphate of lime to

water.

I may mention here that, some time ago, I examined the tank-water con-

taining the drainings and washings of the kennels at Harlow. The

drainings were highly offensive to the smell, although not much discoloured.

An imperial gallon, filtered perfectly clear, on evaporation furnished 36*86

grs. of solid residue, and in this residue I found '44 of phosphate of iron and

4*28 grs. of phosphate of lime, thus showing that phosphate of lime is soluble

to a considerable extent in water charged with putrefying animal matter.

   Phosphate of magnesia, and phosphate of magnesia and ammonia, are con-
siderably more soluble than phosphate of lime, as will be seen by the follow-

ing determinations :

siderably increased by the presence of sal ammoniac in the water with which
the phosphatic materials have been brought into contact.

    In the case of precipitated phosphate of" lime, the difference in the solu-

bility in distilled water and water containing sal ammoniac is very great
indeed. In mineral analyses in which phosphate of lime has to be determined,
the filtrate from the phosphates contains usually sal ammoniac, and in this
solution phosphate of lime, it has been shown, is soluble to a considerable
extent ; it is therefore desirable to remove from this solution the lime by oxa-
late of ammonia, then to evaporate to dryness, and to drive off the ammonia-
cal salts by heat. In the residue the small but appreciable quantity which ought
by no means to be neglected in accurate analysis will be found, and may

be determined by 2NaO, POg and ammonia.

Carbonateof ammonia, like sal ammoniac, appears likewise to render phos-

phate of lime more readily soluble than it is in pure water. This will be seen

not think this was the case in reality, for the difference in the results obtained
with distilled water and water containing 1 per cent, of salt is due to the
fact that in evaporating the solution of phosphate of lime a considerable

quantity of common salt is left, the removal of which necessitates the use of
distilled water. The washings necessarily contain a little phosphate of lime ;

hence the apparent diminished solubility of phosphate of lime in solutions

containing 1 per cent, of salt.

reveal the relative directions in which such objects may happen to lie. On

both of these points some information has been collected by the recent
Commission of Light-houses and Beacons. The amount of this information
is, however, remarkably meagre when contrasted with the elaborate details
furnished by the portion of the report relative to optical signals. This cir-
cumstance is freely admitted ; and at p. xviii of the Report the desirableness
of further experiments on the question of sound-signals is distinctly declared.

   But as the Commissioners received suggestions from several men of science
who had paid attention to the phenomena of sound, a condensed sketch of
such suggestions will be found to present much of the knowledge we possess
upon this question. Before presenting a brief summary of these views, it is

right to point out that the earliest experiments which have any important

bearing upon the subject were instituted many years ago by M. CoUadon,
on the Lake of Geneva. I refer to his well-known researches on the pro-
pagation of sound in water. The manner in which the acoustical properties
of air are diminished by fogs has recently induced men of science (including
many of those who communicated their views to the Commissioners of Light-
houses) to recommend the employment of water as a medium for the trans-
mission of sound. Almost all we know upon this matter is due to M. Col-
ladon*. At first he found that subaqueous sounds were totally reflected at
the surface, at such angles as rendered it impossible to hear them above
water for distances exceeding 200 metres. To remove this obstacle to his
researches he contrived a very ingenious apparatus, that we may for brevity
call a hydrophone. Its shape resembled that of a common tobacco-pipe,

with a broad and very shallow bowl. Its total length was about 5 metres,
or a little more than 16 feet. The pipe was about 18 inches in diameter,
tapering at the end close to the ear, where it terminated in an orifice of about
8 inches. The mouth of the bowl was closed by a partition, whose surface
amounted to a little more than 2 square feet (20 square decimetres). The
hydroplione was entirely made of thin sheets of tinned iron. With this ap-

paratus M. CoUadon could hear a bell under water at a distance of 14,000

metres as well as he could by simply plunging the head at a distance of 200

metres. Subsequent to his earlier experiments, M. CoUadon succeeded in

transmitting distinctly audible sounds under water to the distance of 35,000

metres. The noise of the waves and wind produced little or no effect in
diminishing the subaqueous sound, which could be clearly distinguished
even when the observer's boat had to be held by several anchors in tempes-
tuous weather. The intensity of the sound was so little weakened by di-
stance, that M. CoUadon concludes that the decrease is as the simple distance,
and not as the square of the distance, as in the air. This is explained by

considering that the propagation of sound takes place in a sheet of water,
limited between two surfaces, from which vibrations are totally reflected at

acute angles. On these grounds, as well as from his experiments, he foresees

the possibility of transmitting sounds at sea to distances of some hundreds of
thousands of metres, and of applying such sounds to purposes connected with
navigation, such as occupy us in the present inquiry. One of his most re-
markable results is that of the existence of an acoustic shadow under water.
7his was proved by the eflPect of an interposed wall, in experiments made
along the shore of the lake. This result is especially important in assisting
in determining the direction of a given sound by the interposition of screens,
and on this point water seems to possess decided advantages over air.

TRANSMISSION OF SOUND-SIGNALS DURING FOGS AT SEA. 1'J5

The suggestions of scientific men to the Commissioners of Light-houses

refer principally to sounds propagated in air. Dr. Robinson points out that

the sound should be as discordant as possible with that of the wind and

waves, which are said to belong to C. He thinks that sound should be pro-

duced as near the sea-level as possible. Mr. Mallet calls attention to explo-

sive sounds as assisting the ear in ascertaining direction. Admiral FitzRoy

suggests sharp high-pitched notes, with trumpet-mouthed devices for ascertain-

ing the direction. He thinks that the source of sound should be at a low

level. Sir John Herschel recommends the trial of a battery of steam-whistles

blown by high-pressure steam ; by a combination of three or several sets of

three whistles pitched exactly to harmonic intervals (key note third, fifth, and

octave), and with a rattle which intensifies the action on the auditory nerve.

He also suggests concave reflectors, and the subaqueous propagation of sound

by explosions in the foci of large and heavy parabolic reflectors. Professor

Potter suggests the use of ear-trumpets, in order to assist observers. Pro-

fessor Rankine recommends a parabolic ear-trumpet for the determination of

direction. The Abbe Moigno maintains that a continuous grave sound spreads

further than a very acute violent sound. Thus he instances the greater

distance at which the sound of a cannon can be heard compared to thunder.

He suggests resonant tubes like those attached to Savart's acoustical ap-

Heparatus.  thinks such resonant tubes far more effective than reflectors.

He also recommends, for ascertaining direction, the use of a dififerential ear-
trumpet, like Dr. Scott Alison's stethophone*. He thinks that sound should

be produced close to, or even in the water, and that a series of defined sounds

could be arranged beforehand, one being assigned to each maritime station.

He refers to M. Colladon's experiments for details relative to subaqueous

sounds. Mr. J. Mackintosh, of Liverpool, makes a suggestion in complete

accordance with M. Colladon's (inclusions. He suggests a deep well in

light-ships, whence the sound of a large bell might be propagated all around

Athrough the water.  kind of hydrophone applied from a vessel to the

water might enable an observer to find the position of the light-ship. These

suggestions contain nearly all the information presented in the Report on

Light-houses and Beacons. Remarks made by other gentlemen are either

equivalent to some of the foregoing, or have reference only to some improve-

ments in the details of the existing system of fog-bells.

Professor Wheatstone has informed me that it had been his intention, in

co-operation with the late Mr. Robert Stephenson, to institute a series of ex-

periments on sound, with reference to fog-signals. For this purpose Mr.

Stephenson intended to employ his own yacht ; and had he been spared longer

to science, the information we possess would probably have been less meagre

than it is. Professor Wheatstone thinks that a battery of shrill whistles

very nearly, but not entirely in unison would be most effective in forcing

sound through a fog. Liquid and solid conductors should be as much as

possible availed of during fogs. Water would be a far better conducting^

medium than air for assisting in the determination of direction.

If we are entitled to come to any positive decision upon the evidence which

we possess, I should say that water seems to present in a higher degree

than air during fogs, the qualities required in a sound conductor. High-

pitched sounds seem to be generally acknowledged as most penetrating

during fogs, but we have little information as to the detection of the direction

of such sounds. On the other hand, we already possess a clue to the direc-

tion of subaqueous sounds in M. Colladon's acoustic shadow. Upon the

quired, which, if properly devised, will not only lead to some important

practical results, but perhaps throw light on obscure portions of the theory

of sound. I may be permitted to suggest, therefore, that experiments should

be made, 1st, on the best kind of sound for penetrating fogs; 2nd, on the

Report on the Present State of our Knowledge of the Birds of

   the Genus Apteryx living in Neio Zealand. By Philip Lutley
   ScLATER and Ferdinand von Hochstetter.

There appears to be sufficient evidence of the present existence of at least
four species of birds of the genus Apteryx in New Zealand, concerning
which we beg to offer the following remarks, taking the species one after

the other, in the order that they have become successively known to science.

                                  1. Apteryx AusTRALis.

   Apteryx australis, Shaw, Nat. Misc. xxiv. pis. 1057, 1058, and Gen. Zool.
Xiii. p. 71; Bartlett, Proc. Zool. Soc. 1850, p. 275; Yarrell, Trans. Zool.

Soc. i. p. 71. pi. 10.

   The Apteryx australis was originally made known to science by Dr. Shaw

about the year 1813, from an example obtained in New Zealand by Capt.

Barclay, of the ship ' Providence.' This bird, which was deposited in the
collection of the late Lord Derby, was afterwards described at greater lengtii
in 1833 in the 'Transactions of the Zoological Society' by Mr. Yarrell,
and was still at that date the only specimen of tliis singular form known to
exist. Examples oi Apteryx subsequently obtained, though generally referreil
to the present species, have mostly belonged to the closely allied Apteryx

mantelli of Bartlett, as we shall presently show, though specimens of the
true Apteryx australis exist in the British Museum and several other

collections.

   The original bird described by Dr. Shaw is stated by Mr. Bartlett (Proc.
Zool. Soc. 1850, p. 276) to have come from Dusky Bay in the province of
Otago, Middle Island, where Dr. Mantell's specimen, upon which Mr. Bart-

lett grounded his observations as to the distinctness of this species and
Apteryx maiitelli, was also procured.

   Dr. Hochstetter was able to learn nothing of the existence of this Apteryx
in the province of Nelson in the same island ; and the species is so closely
allied to the Apteryx mantelli, as to render it very desirable that furtiier
examples of it should be obtained, and a rigid comparison instituted between

the two. At present, however, we must regard this form of Apteryx as

belonging to the southern portion of the Middle Island.

    Owen's Apteryx, which is readily distinguished from the preceding species

and A. manfelli by its smaller size, transversely barred plumage and slender
bill, was first described by Mr. Gould in 184'7, from an example procured
by Mr. F. Strange, and " believed to have been obtained from the South

Island." Since that period other specimens have been received in this
country, which have sufficed to establish the species ; and from the informa-
tion obtained by Dr. v. Hochstetter, there is no doubt of this being the com-

mon Apteryx of the northern portion of the JNIiddle Island.

    " In the spurs of the Southern Alps, on Cook's Straits, in the province of
Nelson," says Dr. v. Hochstetter, " that is, in the higher wooded mountain-
valleys of the Wairau chain, as also westwards of Blind Bay, in the wooded
mountains between the Motucka and Aorere valleys, Kiwis of this species are

still found in great numbers. During my stay in the province of Nelson I

had myself two living examples (male and female) of this species. They

were procured by some natives, whom I sent out for this purpose, in the

upper wooded valleys of the River ' State,' a confluent of the Aorere, in a
country elevated from 2000 to 3000 feet above the sea-level. It appears that
this Apteryx still lives very numerously and widely spread in the extended

southern continuations of the Alps."

                                   3. Apteryx mantklli.

    Apteryx attstralis, Gould, Birds of Australia, vi. pi. 5.

              mantelU, Bartlett, Proc. Zool. Soc. 1847, p. 93.

   The characters which distinguish this commoner and better-known Ap/ery.v
from the true A. australis of Shaw were pointed out by Mr, Bartlett at the
meeting of the Zoological Society held on the 10th of December, 1850.

" This bird differs from the original Apteryx australis of Dr. Shaw," says
Mr. Bartlett, "in its smaller size; its darker and more rufous colour ; its

longer tarsus, which is scutellated in front; its shorter toes and claws, which

are horn-coloured ; its smaller wings, which have much stronger and thicker

quills; and also in having long straggling hairs on the face."
   Mr. Bartlett tells us that, as far as he has been able to ascertain, all speci-

mens of Apteryx mantelli are from the Northern Island ; and this is completely
confirmed by Dr. von Hochstetter's observations, which are as follows:

    " In the northern districts of the Northern Island this species of Apteryx
appears to have become quite extinct. But in the island called Hou-tourou,
or Little Barrier Island (a small island, completely wooded, ranging about
1000 feet above the sea-level, and only accessible when the sea is quite calm),
which is situated in the Gulf of Hauraki, near Auckland, it is said to be
still tolerably common. In the inhabited portions of the southern districts
of the Northern Island also, it is become nearly exterminated by men, dogs

--and wild cats, and here is only to be found in the more inaccessible and less

populous mountain-chains that is, in the wooded mountains between Cape
Palliser and East Cape.

    " But the inhabitants of the Northern Island speak also of two sorts of
Kiwi, which they distinguish as Kiivi-nui (Large Kiwi) and Kiwiiti (Small
Kiwi). The Kiwi-nui is said to be found in the Tuhna district, west of Lake

Taupo, and is, in my opinion, Apteryx mantelli. The Kiwi-iti may possibly

\iQ Apteryx owenii, though I can give no certain information on this subject."

   " Roa-roa" of the natives of tlie Southern Island.

  The existence of a larger species of Apteryx in the Middle Island of New

Zealand has long ago been affirmed, and though no specimens of this bird
have yet reached Europe, the following remarks of Dr. v. Hochstetter seem

to leave no reasonable doubt of its actual existence :
   " Besides 4/^-'V/«^ oiosnii, a second larger species lives on the Middle

Island, of vvhich, although no examples have yet reached Europe, the existence

is nevertheless quite certain. The natives distinguish this species not as a
Kiwi, but as a Roa, because it is larger tlian A. owenii (Roa meaning ' long'

or ' tali ').

   "John Rochfort, Provincial Surveyor in Nelson, who returned from an

expedition to the western coast of the province while I was staying at Nelson
in his Report, which appeared in the 'Nelson Examiner' of August 24th,

1859, describes this species, which is said to be by no means uncommon in
the Paparoa chain (a wooded range of about 2000 to 3000 feet in elevation

-- Abetween the Grey and Buller Rivers), in tiie following terms : ' Kiwi

about the size of a Turkey, very powerful, having spurs on his feet, which,

when attacked by a dog, defends himself so well as frequently to come off

victorious.'

  My" friend Julius Haart, a German, who was my travelling companion in

New Zealand, and in the beginning of the year 1860 undertook an exploring

expedition to the southern and M-estern parts of the province of Nelson,

writes to me in a letter dated July 1860, ten miles above the mouth of

--the river Buller, on the mountains of the Buller chain (which, at a height of

from 3000 to 4000 feet, were at that time it being winter in New Zealand

slightly covered with snow), that the tracks of a large Kiwi of the size of a

Turkey were very common in the snow, and that at night he had often heard

the singular cry of this bird, but that, as he had no dog with him, he had

not succeeded in getting an example of it. He had, nevertheless, left M'ith

some natives in that district a tin can with spirits, and promised them a
good reward if they would get him one of these birds in spirits and send
it to Nelson by one of the vessels which go from time to time to the west

coast."

In concluding this brief Report, we wish to call attention to the importance

of obtaining further knowledge respecting the recent species of this singular

Weform of birds whilst it is yet possible to do so.    see that one of them

(the Ajyteryx mantelli) is already fast disappearing, whilst its history, hal)its,

mode of nidification, and many other particulars respecting it are as yet

Wealtogether unknown.  therefore trust that such members of this Asso-

ciation as have friends or correspondents in any part of New Zealand will

impress upon them the benefits that they will confer on science by

endeavouring to procure more specimens of, and additional information con-

cerning, the different species of the genus Apterijx.

Rejjort of the Results of Deep-sea Dredying in Zetland ; with a Notice
    of several Species of Mollusca neiv to Science or to the British Isles.

  By J. GwYN Jeffreys, F.R.S., F.G.S.

The Report was submitted by the author, as one of the General Dredging
Committee, not so much for the sake of announcing his discovery of new

species, as of maintaining certain views which he had ventured to suggest on
                                                                                                             --

former occasions with respect to the geographical distribution of the marine

fauna of Europe. A yachting excursion which he had taken in the course

of this summer, accompanied by two scientific friends, to the northernmost

part of the British Isles, together with an examination of the upper tertiaries

in SufFoliv and Norfolk which he had since made in company with Mr. Prest-

wich, gave the author a better insight into the scope of such distribution

than had resulted from his previous researches, and confirmed his belief that
the division into separate areas or " provinces," which had been proposed

by so many systematists (all of whom held different opinions as to the ex-

tent and limits of such " provinces "), was erroneous, and that the present

distribution must be referred to a state of things which has indeed passed

away, but left a very distinct impress of its action. The author is inclined-

to take the Coralline Crag as a starting-point, and to consider the marine

fauna of Europe, Northern Asia, the Cis-Atlantic zone of Africa, and part

of North America, as having been closely related at a comparatively recent

epoch, and as forming one common area of origin. Many species of Mol-

Myalusca once existed at botii extremities of this vast district e.g.                                                                         trun-

cata and  Buccinuni undatum                                                                             and  other species hitherto supposed  to  be
                                                                                                     ;

restricted to the Mediterranean (viz. Monodonta limbata and CeritJiium vid-

gatiim, with its variety C.calabrum) have lately been discovered by Professor

Sars on tiie coasts of Finmark. It is also probable that the recent exploration

of the Greenland seas by Otto Torell and otliers may reveal further instances

of a similar kind. Very little has hitherto been done towards the investiga-

tion of the Arctic fauna. It by no means follows that an extremely rigorous
or " arctic " temperature prevailed in those places where we find the remains

of some Mollusca which now inhabit only the seas of colder regions, or, vice

versa, that the presence in tliese regions of fossil shells belonging to species

which now inhabit only more southern seas indicates the former prevalence
of a warm climate. The temperature of the sea at certain depths is well
known to be very equable ; and it is only littoral or shallow-water species

that would be exterminated or affected by a change of climate. Some kinds

appear to be more hardy than others, and to have survived considerable and

perhaps frequent changes of temperature; while others have undergone a

limited modification of form, and are considered by some naturalists as

Adistinct (or "representative") species.                                                                     great deal, however, yet remains

to be done, by accumulating facts, and a critical comparison of recent with

fossil species, before a complete or satisfactory theory of distribution can be

established.

   Mr. Jeffreys contrasted his experience of this dredging expedition wifli
those he had made to other parts of the British coasts as well as to the

Mediterranean, and also with the accounts he had received of similar expe-

--ditions to the coasts of Norway and Sweden showing the far greater

difficulties which attended an exploration of our northernmost sea, by reason

of the variable and often tempestuous weather, and of that line of coast being

unsheltered from the prevailing winds. He, however, succeeded in procuring

three species of Mollusca new to science, which he proposed to name Mar-

garita clegantula, Aclis Walkri, and Nassa ? Haliaeti, besides twelve other
species which were new to the British Isles. Of these last, ten are Scandi-

navian, one is Mediterranean, and the other had hitherto been known only

as a Crag fossil. He reserved the description and particulai's of these species

for a work on British Conchology which he had undertaken. He ascertained

that the Gulf-stream never impinges on any part of the coast which he had

examined, although the climate was temperate.

   The author noticed the occurrence at considerable depths (nearlv 80

                                                                       n2

fathoms) of living Mollusca which usually inhabit the shore or very shallow

--water, viz. Lamellaria perspicua, Nassa incrassata, and Cyprcea Europcca,

all of them being Avidely diffused species, thus apparently illustrating the
view entertained by the late Professor Edward Forbes, that those species
which have the widest horizontal range have the greatest vertical depth.
Judging, however, from the great depth at which he found the fossil shells

of some Mollusca {e.g. Pecten Islandicus and Mya tnmcata \ax. Uddeval-

lensis) which inhabit much shallower water in the Arctic zone, the author is

disposed to believe that the bed of this part of our Northern Sea has sunk

since the so-called " glacial " epoch, and that this circumstance may possibly

account for the above-mentioned occurrence of sublittoral species at such
depths.

   With respect to the comparative size of those Mollusca which are common

to the seas of the North as well as of the South of Europe, the author re-
ferred to an observation made by Mr. Salter, in a recent number of the
' Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,' that some fossil shells which
jNIr. Lamont had brought from Spitzbergen were larger than those of the
corresponding species in our own mountain limestone ; and he remarked that
the same rule appears to apply also to marine plants, for he never saw such
gigantic fronds of the Laminaria saccharina, which fringes all our coast-
line, as he did in the voes of North Zetland.

   The author concluded by paying a just tribute of respect to the labours of
Professors Sars and Loven, Malm, Morch, Asbjornsen, and other Scandi-
navian naturalists, who were investigating the Mollusca of the Northern seas
with a zeal and accuracy worthy of our emulation.

      Contrihutions to a Report on the Physical Aspect of the Moon.

 By J. Phillips, M.A., LL.D.,F.R.S., Professor of Geoloyy, Oxford.

Professor Phillips noticed the result of his sketches of parts of the surface
of the moon, and also described Mi-. Birt's contributions to a report on seleno-
graphy, which had been undertaken by direction of the General Committee

at Oxford, with the view of discovering the character of the moon's surface
as influenced by previous physical events. Professor Phillips's observations
related especially to the mountain Gassendi, to which his attention had been
directed by the Committee in 1852, but included also drawings of remarkable
' rills,' and other interesting peculiarities, in Aristarchus, Archimedes, and

Plato.

  --The rills to which Prof. Phillips had given principal attention were (1) the

well-known stag's-horn rill E. of Thebit, which appeared to be what geolo-
gists call a ' fault ' or ' slip,' one side elevated above the other, and with some
inequality in the dislocation when the shadow is accurately inspected; (2)
the long rill on which the small crater called Hyginus is situated ; (3) the
group of parallel rills about Campanus and Hippalus. Regarding these it
was remarked that the drawing of Miidler, which, like all the work in his
great map, was obviously a careful one, differed in one point from that made

 the crater marked A, which is likewise traversed bj' the longest rill of all,
 that, viz., nearest to Campanus. Another rill is traced by Prof. Phillips quite

across and through the old crater of Hippalus ; and all the rills appear to him
 to be rifts or deep fissures, receiving strong shadows from oblique light, and
 even acquiring brightness on one edge of the cavity. Their breadth appears

to be only a few hundred feet or yards. He exhibited drawings of these

objects on a large scale, one being a section across the crater of Gassendi,

another a map of the curious region extending from Aristarchus and Hero-

dotus along the interrupted rift or valley which opens by a seeming delta
into the seeming dried sea-bed with indented coasts on the south.

    Speaking of Gassendi, of which he had made drawings under different
conditions of light and shade, from sunrise on the mountains to mid-day,
and slighter, sketches at later hours, he remarked, in addition to what has
been recorded by Miidler, the much-varied character of the ' rings,' the deep

narrow fissures across the ring on the S.E. side, the rocky character of the
central elevations in the interior area, the rough terraces and ridges within
the great ring on the east and also the north-west side, the occurrence of
only two small craters in the northern part of the area, and the variation of
colour on the surface, without shadow, according to the change of the angle
of incidence of the sun's rays.

  He also drew attention to the existence of delicate ramifications of small

ridges and hollows in the S.VV. part of the ai-ea, which had a marked con-
vergence towards the broad lip of the deep-attached cavity known as the

Spoon. He expressed his great desire to receive drawings of Gassendi as

      Contribution to a Report on the Physical Aspect of the Moon.

                         By W. R. BiRT, F.R.A.S,

On the present occasion I propose confining my contribution to the physical

features characterizing the well-known spot Plato, some of which are fami-
liar to astronomers, while others, I have some reason to believe, have not
hitherto been pointed out. I have included all that have come under obser-

vation during the twenty-nine months between January 1860 and May 1862,

inclusive, in a synopsis of objects suitable for further telescopic observation.

This synopsis of objects is necessarily incomplete. To each object observed
I have appended, in italics, the number of times it has been the subject of

special observation ; so that every one inserted in the key-plan has been seen

by me at some time during the interval of the observations above mentioned.

The entire period of the visibility of Plato is embraced in the observations,
which are, however, more numerous under the morning and mid-day illumi-
nations than under the evening. Those features that have been more fre-
quently observed may of course be regarded as being more fully established,
at least for the period embraced by the observations; the synopsis forming a
groundwork for the more effectual observation of Plato, especially as re-
gards the interesting questions of absolute repose now existing on the moon's
surface, or the progress of change such as may be detected by human eyes.
Forty-five series of observations contributing to the synopsis, and extending

from January 5, 1860, to July 29, 1861, I have arranged in the order of the

moon's age, in a MS. volume which is deposited in the library of the lloyal
183  .                       EEPORT--1861.

Astronomical Society. The remainder, twenty-three, bringing the observa-

tions to May 12, 1862, are at present in my hands, and are intended to form

part of a second volume, should I be able to pursue the observations. The

arrangement of the volume is such that it can be used as an ephemeris of
the successive appearances of the crater, as well as being indicative of those

objects that require careful and steady watching.

   One of the most interesting objects among those newly pointed out is a

terrace on the south-west interior slope. It, with a ravine in the same neigh-
bourhood, is of an exceedingly delicate character, being brought out (espe-

cially the terrace) by the gradual change in the direction of the incident solar

   Accompanying the synopsis are two illustrative figures. Fig. 1 is a some-
what rough key-plan of the crater, the ellipse being that of the greatest open-

ing presented by Plato. This key-plan possesses no pretensions either to

accuracy of detail or correctness of locality, micrometrically considered; it is

only offered as a guide to the general and relative positions of the objects
included in the synopsis. Fig. 2 is a section indicated by observation of the
south-west interior slope of Plato, showing the terrace or ledge Y, one of the

new features brought to light by this series of observations. The reader is re-
ferred to Beer and Madler's large map of the moon, and is specially requested

to compare the delineation of the crater as they have given it with the key-

Aplan accompanying this licport.  careful comparison of them will show

the features they have in common, and the departures that may exist in those

determined by the present scries of observations from the representations of
the same features as given by Beer and Miidler. Schroter has given some
of the features mentioned, especially the mountain-range (w), which he marks
H, the mountain r, the shadows of the three peaks y, c, and e, the mountain

--c, which in Scbroter's drawing is marked D, and the crater x. which is no

longer in existence if Schroter really saw a perfect crater as he has deline-
ated it. In another delineation of Plato by Schroter, showing the two mark-
ings i and k on the interior of the north-east slope as he observed them on

December 11, 1788, he also gives a remarkably round cloud-like appear-

ance, not unlike in character to the one that has been so constantly a subject

of my own observation, marked/ in the key-plan. These delineations may

be found in his ' Selcnotopographische Fragmente,' t. xxi.

   To render the results of the inquiry of greater value, a careful microme-
trical survey of Plato, when presented under the greatest visual angle, would
be important. Every well-determined spot would be laid down in its accu-

rate position as seen from the earth under that angle ; and if such a survey

were executed with the requisite precision, one epoch only being fixed on,
and no reduction to a mean state of libration admitted, it would not be dif-

ficult, after a few years' observations, to judge of the probable fixity of aspect
presented by the most prominent features, and changes, if any, would soou

render themselves apparent.

 Synopsis of objects in Plato suitable for telescopic observation, tvitk reference
                             to fixity or variability of absolute aspect.

   By absolute aspect, I mean the aspect dependent on the object itself, its

--form and constitution, not an aspect dependent on the variability of the

incidence of solar light, or on the variability of the direction of the visual
ray as the object is seen from the earth, the one indicated by the moon's age,
the other by the libration of the moon.

--AI. n.   short range of mountains running at first nearly at right angles

to the mountainous rim of Plato, from a break in tlie northern or, rather,

north-western portion of the rim. This range of mountains is of a curved

form, and terminates in the mountain i^. It constitutes the western rim of

a crateriform formation to the north of Plato.

   This mountain- range has been tlie subject of eleven observations between

January 1860 and May 1862. Schroter had previously observed it, and

marked it /<. Under a suitable illumination, a shallow depression is seen
westward of this mountain-range, the land rising a little on the westward of

it, so that a somewhat narrow valley is enclosed between the two. There are

two well-defined peaks on the eastern or highest range, and a small one be-

tween them and the rim.
--AII. /.
           break on the north-western rim of Plato, which is doubtless the

continuation of the narrow valley west of the mountain-range (?i). It is

distant about 0*75 of the longest diameter of the apparent ellipse from the

east, and is very distinctly shown in the drawing of Schroter.

   The observations of this break in the rim of Plato have been numerous.
On three occasions the valley-like character of it has been recorded. Under

a suitable illumination, u bright streak from Anaxagoras to Plato may be

seen terminating near this break.

This indentation, which is best seen about full moon, or about fifteen or

sixteen days of the moon's age, marks, I appreliend, the form of the rim of

Plato hereabout. It is well shown in a sketch by Webb, under date of 1855,

October 24, ten to eleven hours ; the sketch is preserved in the volume of
Observations on Plato deposited in the library of the Royal Astronomical

Society. It is approximately figured aX jJ, detached from the key-plan of the

crater, as it is only visible for about two days near the full.

            short, light spur in the neighbourhood of 7^, which, with the

X. ^.       bold rock jutting intq the interior, casting a well-defined shadow

eastward in the morning and forenoon, and westward on the floor of the

crater towards sunset : it is more frequently observed as the eastern extre-

mity of the longest diameter of the apparent ellipse.

This rock is one of the finest and most conspicuous objects in the neigh-

bourhood of Plato during the morning illumination, glowing in the rays of

the sun like molten silver. From about 7*5 to 8*5 days of the moon's age,

it is seen as a very brilliant point at the eastern extremity of the crater;

during the next two days (from 8"5 to 10\5 days of the moon's age) it is

very distinguishable, standing out as a bold rock, and casting a well-defined

shadow eastward ; during the next three days (from 10"5 to 13*5) it loses its

shadow, but continues a perceptibly bright object, imparting to the eastern

extremity its peculiar brilliancy at this age of the moon. It is now lost for

some time. About nineteen days of the moon's age it has been seen very

distinctly ; two days later, viz. at twenty-one days, its shadow has been seen

on the floor of Plato ; and about this time, or rather later, it has been seen

standing out in fine and bold relief, a magnificent object, its height above

the general altitude of the ring being apparent not only by the acuminated

character of its shadow on the floor of the crater, but by its towering consi-

derably above the general summit. It appears to be a formation in a mea-

sure distinct from the ring itself, and greatly allied in its character to that of

Pico on the south of Plato; indeed, it deserves as conspicuous a position on

a map as Pico. It possesses two bold spurs on the north-east and south-

east. Its very appearance is exceedingly suggestive, especially when taken

in connexion with a formation immediately south of it. Both should be most

carefully and scrupulously watched, in order to determine if any degrading

forces are at work hereabout.

This rock has been observed under the morning and forenoon illumina-

tions on eighteen occasions, and under the evening on four occasions.

Schrdter gives a rude figure of it in t. xxiii.

slope of the rock 'C, in the neighbourhood of the north-eastern spur.

                   y^.  Schroter also gives another crater of about the same size, which

he marks x, north of Plato. In his delineation it is placed about midway

between Plato and the Mare Frigoris. In the whole course of my observa-

tions I have not met with this crater, nor have I seen anytliing similar to

that delineated by Schroter. On the night of August 27, 1861, moon's age

21'53 days, I found a very interesting object on the northern boundary of

the bright ground north of Plato. It consisted of a semi-elliptical range of

mountains very similar to a half-crater, the existing portion of the ring not

greatly elevated above the surface ; the south-east side was more elevated

than the south-west, so that its external slope caught the rays of the after-

noon sun, which rendei'ed it the most brilliant object in the immediate

locality. The south-west portion of this half-ring was seen to terminate a

little short of the line of junction of the bright ground north of Plato and

the dark ground of the Mare Frigoris, the south-east portion being cut

off sharply by the south edge of the Mare Frigoris. I did not observe any

difference of level between the lighter rugged ground on which the half-ring

was seen and the darker and smoother surface of the Mare Frigoris. The

situation of this half-ring is very near the locality given by Schroter for the
perfect crater. I have indicated it on the key-plan by Schroter's mark y^.

   I also observed this object on September 13, 1861, under the morning

illumination, moon's age 8'87 days ; a,nd again on September 25, moon's age
2P08 days. It requires the precise angle of illumination and visual ray to

catch it.

 --XV. W. An interesting marking just south of the rock ^, somewhat of

the character of a crater, apparently triangular in its form, but on closely

scrutinizing it seen to be a somewhat shallow depression having a gently

curved rampart. Under a suitable illumination, the shadow of this rampart

has been seen well defined within the enclosure. The south-east rim of this

apparent crater, with the contiguous portion of the rim of Plato, forms the

continuation of a ci'.ain of mountains which takes its rise at an isolated

mountain south-east of Plato (c) (see key-plan, fig. 1). This chain of moun-

tains is well seen under the evening illumination about 21 '5 days of the,

moon's age.

The position of this depression is on the upper part of the eastern slope of

Plato. It is separated from the large crater by a portion of the eastern rim

of Plato, which also forms its western rim. On May 2, 1860, the colour of

the interior was very slightly, if any, darker than the surface exterior to

Plato, and much lighter than the floor of Plato. It has been observed on

fifteen occasions.

   Under a very early illumination it may easily be mistaken for a crater

the western slope was shining with considerable brilliancy. It has been

observed eir/ht times. Its situation with regard to dd and v (see key- plan )

requires to be determined ; also its real character, whether it be a mountain

or a crater. On some occasions, under an early illumination, it has been
described as a crater; on others, as a mountain. From the description of

   XXXIV. gg.--A crater figured by Schroter, and marked by him ^, at tlie

western extremity of the three mountains //. The writer observed and
figured it on January 8, 1862; but did not see it on March S, 1862, when
the moon was nearly of the same age.

   The floor of Plato presents some exceedingly interesting appearances. It
is figured by Beer and Madler as being crossed by four streaks of a some-
what lighter tint than that of the general surface of the floor (see the large
Map). These have not been observed within the epochs limiting the period

of tiie observations forming the basis of this Report, January 1860 and May

1862 ; but a remarkable, broad, branching, whitish, cloud-like streak, crossing
the floor at certain epochs of the moon's age perpendicularly, and at others
when it is more distinctly apparent in a diagonal direction (/) (see key-plan,
fig. 1), has been seen very frequently ; in fact, during the continuance of the

observations, it may be regarded as having possessed a decided characteristic

of coustunci/.

   The change of direction of this marking as the sun passes from west to
cast in his lunar-diurnal course is very interesting, and is in some measure

indicative of the nature of the surface of the floor, the direction being

apparently dependent on some peculiarity of reflection in the surface. It
appears to be connected with the bright mountain (m) on the north-west
rim, as under certain angles of illumination it is seen invariably to take its

rise therefrom. This is a feature that requires careful watching. It has

more than once been traced to the rayed crater Anaxagoras, and on a very
favourable occasion was seen to be connected witli tlie ray that terminates
near the bright mountain m. It is only visible during certain, epochs of

illumination.

   Schroter appears to have observed, in December 1788, a somewhat similar
marking, but of a round form (consult his figs. 6, 7 and 8, t. xxi.). Taking the
three periods of observation, Schroter's, Beer and Miidler's, and the writer's,

it would seem tliat the markings of the floor are of a variable character.
   The portion of the floor not covered by this marking, and the whole when

it is not visible, undergoes variations of tint, from a decided greenish tint just
after sunrise, when it mostly appears with a delicate smooth surface, to a deep-
blackish grey, of a diluted inky character, at mid-day, the smoothness of sur-

face having considerably disappeared.
    Beer and Miidler have indicated three or four minute specks on the sur-

face ; Gruithuisen detected seven. One, nearly central, I have more or less

constantly observed under suitable angles of illumination. Tiie Rev. T. W.

Preliminary Report on the Dredging Committee for the Mersey and

           Dee, By Dr. Collingwood and Mr. Byerley.

This Committee was appointed last year at Oxford, and the present Report
was a resume of all that had previously, and since then, been ascertained
concerning the Marine Fauna of that region. The past season having been

very unfavourable for dredging operations, several important families still

remained unexplored, chiefly among the minuter Crustacea, Annelids, Ento-
mostraca and Foraminifera. The following comparison of ascertained
species with those of the British Fauna will serve to show some of the

results given.

   Your Committee re-elected Admiral Moorsom to be their Chairman, and
at his decease the Duke of Sutherland succeeded him.

   Your Committee having held monthly meetings, and intermediate meetings

--of a sub-Committee, presided over by the Chairman, beg leave to present the

following Reports :

   At the last meeting of the British Association, after the Committee's Report
had been presented, Admiral Moorsom read a paper before the Mechanical
Section on the Performance of Steam Vessels, and a discussion ensued which
demonstrated the great want that is felt by men of science, both in England
and in other countries, of definite knowledge based on actual experiment re-
specting the resistance offered by vessels of various sizes and types, to being
drawn through the water. As the means of trying such experiments could
only be satisfactorily obtained from a Government having every description
of vessel in its service, your Committee determined urgently to renew their
applications to the British Admiralty, that that body should, for the benefit
of science generally, conduct a series of experiments ; and to state that the
Committee were even prepared to advise upon or conduct such experiments,

if the Admiralty so desired.

   The Chairman accordingly communicated with the First Lord of the Admi-
ralty, repeating the various arguments hitherto advanced, with concise state-
ments of the general nature of the detailed experiments deemed necessarj'',
and which are briefly as follows :

    1. The specific resistance of certain ships selected as types, and of the fol-

lowing displacements, viz.,-- about 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000,
7000 tons, and upwards. Such resistance under traction being measured by

--dynamometer, and under the three following conditions ;

              (1.) Of the hull when launched.
               (2.) Ditto with machinery on board.
              (3.) Ditto when ready for sea.

   2. The thrust of the screw, measured by dynamometer, when propelled by
steam under the two last of the above three conditions, and under similar

circumstances of smooth water and calm.
   3. Full particulars of the dimensions and form of the ships, of the boilers

and furnaces, of the engines, and of the propeller.
   4. Detailed particulars of the performances of the same or similar ships in

snooth water at the measured mile, with the particulars and conditions set

forth in a Form of Return which accompanied the memorandum, or any other,
more comprehensive or effectual, that might be given.

   5. The actual performance of the same or similar vessels at sea, with the
particulars and conditions set forth as aforesaid.

    Your Committee would remark in passing, that from the date of their first
appointment, they have not ceased, on every available occasion, to press this
subject upon the attention of the authorities ; but, up to the present time,
your Committee are not aware that any experiments of the kind have been

undertaken.

    In the Report presented to your Association at Oxford, it is stated that a
                                                      --

--192 REPORT 1861.

table of certain of Her Majesty's vessels, seventeen In number, had been con-
 structed, containing the results of the best trials as conducted by the Govern-
ment officers, and that it had been forwarded to the Admiralty with the
request that the additional particulars of the hull and machinery' might be filled
in. The table, however, did not arrive in time to be inserted in their Report.

   Your Committee have great pleasure in being now enabled to lay it before

your Association in the state it has been received from the Admiralty.
(Appendix, Table 1.) They would remark in connexion with this return,
that it appears that the authorities have not been in the habit of recording
either the quantity of coals consumed or the evaporation of water, and they

have made application to the Admiralty that in future these desiderata may

be obtained.
    In compliance with the terms of the resolution appointing the Committee,

viz., " That the attention of the Committee be also directed to obtaining infor-
mation respecting the performance of vessels under sail, with a view to com-
paring the results of the two powers of wind and steam," your Committee
have to state that hitherto they have been unable to obtain such comparisons
in the case of merchant vessels, but in the Table given in Appendix, Table 2,

particulars of one of H.M. vessels are recorded under three conditions, viz.,

under steam alone, under sail alone, and under steam and sail combined,
and of two under the two latter conditions only.

   These are especially useful, as they show the effects produced by powers
brought to bear upon the hulls of vessels under the same conditions as to
draft and trim, but differently applied.

   In endeavouring to collect this Information from officers in H.M.'s service,
the Committee were desirous that the application should be made with the
concurrence of the Admiralty, and a circular was accordingly issued to a se-
lected number of officers, accompanied by a form, which they were requested
to fill up and return. At the request of the Admiralty, copies of these docu-
ments were submitted for their Inspection.

   The circular stated that the Committee had apprized the Admiralty of the
Committee's proposal to communicate with such captains and engineers of

H.M.'s vessels as might be disposed to assist the British Association in obtain-
Ino- facts for scientific calculations relating to the performance of ships at sea.

   The form proposed was as simple as was consistent with the object of ob-
taining data necessary for calculation, and the Committee conceived that the
time required to fill up such forms would not interfere with the duties of the
respective officers. It also stated that the Committee Invited the co-opera-

tion of officers for the benefit of science alone, and that one of the fundamental

rules laid down by the Association In directing their labours was as follows ;
   " The object of the Committee is to make public recorded facts, through

the medium of the Association, which, being accessible to the public in that
manner, will bring the greatest amount of science to the solution of the diffi-
culties now existing to the improvement of the forms of vessels and the qua-
lities of marine engines. They will especially endeavour to guard against
Information so furnished to them being used in any other way."

   Your Committee Issued the Circular and Form of Return (see Appendix,

p. 198) to upwards of 200 of H.M.'s captains In commission, and to their chief
engineers through the captains.

   Numerous replies have been received promising returns ; but the distance
at which most of the vessels are stationed, namely, China, the East Indies,
and America, has precluded our receiving such particulars in time for this
Report. Returns, however, of seven vessels have been received, six of which

are given In Appendix, Table 2 ; and the seventh vessel, the ' Victor Emman-

uel,' being returned in a different form, is given separately in Appendix,

Tables 3 and 4. This is the more valuable, as the returns of seven trials on

the measured mile are given with it.

Your Committee are aware that several officers are conducting a series of

experiments under various conditions, which it is their intention to report to

your Association, through this Committee, on their return home.

The Log-book, compiled by your Committee, is also being filled up by the

same officers, with a similar object.

Your Committee have met with great success in their applications to ship-

owners, engineers, and builders for information respecting the sea performances

of merchant vessels. In no case have they met with a refusal to supply all

the data in their possession, and your Committee have reason to believe that

before long the records kept on the voyages will be amplified, and the data

thus obtained be published periodically by shipowners themselves.
   The thanks of the Committee are especially due to the Peninsular and

Oriental Company, to the London and North-Western Company, to the

Pacific Steam Navigation Company, to the City of Dublin Steam Packet
Company, to Messrs. Morrison and Co. of Newcastle, to Messrs. Penn and
Sons, the Thames Shipbuilding Company, Messrs. R. Napier and Son, Messrs.

Fawcett, Preston and Co., and Messrs. J. and W. Dudgeon.

   The Peninsular and Oriental Company freely offered their books for in-

spection, and placed the logs of their vessels ' Candia,' ' Ceylon,' ' Columbia,'

' Delta,' ' Nubia,' and ' Pera,' in the hands of the Committee, to make any

extracts they deemed useful.

   Copies of voyages from Southampton to Alexandria, and from Aden to

Calcutta, and return of those vessels respectively, were taken, and the average
performances worked out. They are given in the Table of Merchant Vessels

(Appendix, Table 5).

   The London and North-Western Railway Company have furnished your

Committee with information of especial value, viz., the trial performance and

--ordinary working performance of one of their vessels, the ' Cambria,' under

two conditions the first as originally constructed, the second after being
lengthened 40 feet. Data of this description are precisely those required to
enable the naval architect to judge what are the qualities which constitute a
good vessel, and assist him in designing vessels possessed of high speed,

great capacity, limited draught of water, economy of power, and all the
qualities which constitute good sea-going ships, with much greater certainty

than heretofore.

In the same table (No. 5) your Committee have thought fit to repeat a

somewhat similar return, given in their last Report, viz., a Table, &c., show-

ing the Trial Performance of the steam vessels ' Lima ' and ' Bogota ' when

fitted with single-cylinder engines, and after being refitted with double-

cyHnder engines                                                                      also the  sea performances  of  the same vessels under both
                                                                                  ;

these conditions of machinery, and on the same sea-service.

These returns, therefore, show the difference of performance of a vessel

with the same machinery but lengthened in her hull, and of two vessels with

the hull a constant, but with entirely different engines.

_A glance at the column showing the consumption of coals in each case

will at once demonstrate the importance of the subject in a commercial point

of view.

   The London and North- Western Company have likewise furnished returns

of the speed and consumption of coal of their express and cargo boats, under
regulated conditions of time, pressure, and expansion, from January 1 to De-
cember 31, 1860 (Ai^peudix, Table 6). Similar returns for 1858 and 1859
are contained in the two former Reports of this Committee, and show the
regularity with which the service has been conducted.

194                --REPORT 1861.

Your Committee would again call the attention of shipowners to the system

of trials which has resulted in the combination of perfect regularity and effi-

ciency of service with economy (so far as the vessels and machinery would

admit) which this series of returns exhibits.

    In the first Report of this Committee, presented to your Association at the
Meeting held in Aberdeen, a series of tables are given, showing the method
which was adopted for ascertaining the working capabilities of each vessel.

The following explanation was furnished by Admiral Moorsom, and illustrates

the means by which the proper service to be obtained from a vessel may be

estimated* :

  " When the four passenger vessels, ' Anglia,' ' Cambria,' ' Hibernia,' and

' Scotia,' were first employed in August 1848, the commanders were autho-

rized to drive them as hard as they could, subject only to the injunction not

to incur danger."

After some months' trial the qualities of each vessel and her engines were

ascertained, and a system was brought into operation which continues to the

present time. (Tables 3-14.)

   The Returns Nos. 2 and 6 show the results of the hard driving and the
commencement of the system periods. The column indicating " Time,"
" Pressure," and " Expansion," is the key to the columns "Average Time of
Passage," "Weight on Safety Valves," and "Proportion of Steam in Cylin-

der," and, as a sequence, also to the consumption of coal.

   " Time a minimum " shows the hard driving. " Time a constant " shows
the system. The relations of " pressure " and " expansion " show how, under

hard driving, the highest pressure and the full cylinder produced the highest

speed the wind and tide admitted, or how, the time being a constant, those
two elements were varied at the discretion of the commander, within prescribed

limits, to meet the conditions of wind and tide.
   The result of the system on the coal is a decreasing consumption.
   The Return No. 1 shows the results of certain trials under favourable con-

ditions, but in the performance of the daily passage by four of the vessels,
which results are used as the standard tests with which the results of each

quarter's returns are compared.

For example, the, ' Scotia ' at 15-9 statute miles an hour consumes 6840

lbs. of coal as a standard. (See Table 4.)
   In the Return No. 3, at the speed of 12-96 miles she consumed 5226 lbs.

the first at the rate of 430 lbs. per mile (see Table 5), and the second at

about 403.

   Again, in the succeeding quarter, the ' Scotia ' consumed 7528 lbs. at
14'65 miles an hour, or more than 513 lbs. per mile.

   Here was a case for inquiry and explanation. It will be observed that in
Return No. 1 the consumption of the ' Scotia ' at ordinary work at sea is
5820 lbs. per hour, and it is only when the consumption exceeds 6840 lbs.
that it becomes a subject of question, the difference between those figures

being allowed for contingencies.

No. 4 (see Tables 12, 13) is a Return which shows the difference between

the issues of coal each half year, and the aggregate of the returns of con-

sumption, the object of which needs no elucidation.  ^

No. 5 (see Table 14) shows the duration of the boilers, with particulars of

the work done. The saving in money under the return system, as compared

with hard driving, was of course very considerable, and the latter was only

justifiable as a necessary means of learning the qualities of each vessel, to be
afterwards redeemed by the economy of the system.

Tlie ' Kibernia,' it will be seen, was unequal to the service ; and I may

here observe that experience has shown me that in machinery, as in animal

 power, it is essential that it should be considerably above its ordinary work.

    The want of this extra power was a defect of the early locomotive engines,
 whose cost of working per mile was very considerably higher than that of
the engines now in use.

    This defect, which is that of boiler-power, prevails largely in steam-vessels,

 and especially in the Queen's ships.

    It would be easy to show how system must tend to economy; and the

saving of coal is apparent from the returns, and of course all the engine stores

 are commensurate.

  -- --But the repairs the wear and tear involve a much more important ele-

 ment of economy than even a reduced consumption of coal.
    The Return for 1860 is accompanied by a check account of the consumption

 of coal. (Appendix, Table 7.)

    The City of Dublin Steam Packet Company have obligingly furnished

returns of the consumption of coal and average time of passages of their mail

boats ' Prince Arthur,' ' Llewellyn,' ' Eblana,' and ' St. Coluraba,' from Janu-
ary 1st to December 30th, 1860, the last quarter embracing the fast vessels

 ' Leinster ' and ' Ulster.' (Appendix, Tables 8 and 9.)
    Your Committee were invited to attend a trial of the latter vessels between

Holyhead and Kingstown, and a deputation, consisting of Admiral Moorsom,

the Duke of Sutherland, Lord Alfred Paget, Mr. Wm. Smith, C.E., Mr. J.

E. M'^Connell, and Mr. H. Wright, attended. They were kindly assisted by
Mr. "Watson, the Managing Director of the Company, in obtaining informa-
tion connected with these vessels and their performances. The particulars

of these trials will be found in Appendix, Table 5.

   A deputation from your Committee, consisting of Mr. W. Smith and Mr.

Wright, also at the invitation of the London and North-Western Railway
Company, attended the trial of the ' Admiral Moorsom,' a new cargo boat
built expressly for the conveyance of live stock. The particulars are given
in Appendix, Table 5, to which your Committee would direct attention, as
the speed obtained, and the steadiness exhibited by the vessel in a very heavy
sea, excited considerable surprise. They have received numerous invitations
from other companies and shipowners to attend the trials of their vessels.

    Your Committee have been in correspondence with the Imperial naval
authorities of France and of the United States.

    The latter have already published various trials conducted with admirable
skill and precision, and embracing most of the particulars asked for by the

 Committee.

    In France, the Company of the Messageries Imperiales have for some time

given annual averages of the results of the navigation of the vessels in their
service, for private use only ; but on the application of your Committee to be
supplied with such returns, copies were at once forwarded, with a letter from
the President stating that, although it was not the usual custom of private

companies to make public the information requested, and although the Report
transmitted to them (the Committee's 2nd Report) contained no analogous
comparison of the state of the great English companies who perform similar

service, nevertheless they have not hesitated to accede to the Committee's

--wish, by contributing as much as lay in their power, thus proving their cor-

 dial sympathy with the useful object the British Association have in view.
· The Tables of Results of their vessels, 50 in number, for the years 1859
and 1860, are given in Appendix, Tables 10 and 11, constituting, with the
one given in the last Report, a valuable series extending over three consecu-

tive years.

196 REPORT 1861.

    Your Committee take this opportunity of expressing their satisfaction in
being able to report, that since the commencement of their labours in 1857,
the interest that has been taken in Steamship Performance, and the desire to
assist the Association in eliciting information on the subject, not only by
officers of the Royal Navy, but also of the merchant service, fully bear out the
opinion expressed at the meeting of the Association in Dublin, that this subject
was second to none in importance, and that its steady pursuit would tend
very materially to the advancement of the science of shipbuilding and marine

engineering.

    The following is a general summary of the results of the Committee's
labours during the past season. They have obtained

    1. The particulars of the machinery and hulls of seventeen of H.M.'s vessels,
and the details of 58 trials made during the years 1857, 185S, and 1859, sup-
plied by the Admiralty. The Committee are in possession of copies of the
diagrams taken during the trials in 1859, with notes of observed facts by the
officers conducting the trials. The names of the vessels are the ' James Watt,'

' Virago,' ' Hydra,' ' Centaur,' ' Industry,' ' Diadem,' ' Mersey,' ' Algerine,'
· Leven,' ' Lee,' ' Slaney,' ' Flying Fish,' ' Marlborough,' ' Orlando,' ' Bull-
finch,' 'Doris,' and 'Renown.' (Appendix, Table 1.)

   2. Returns of seven of H.M.'s vessels when at sea, under various circum-

stances, viz., under steam alone, under sail alone, and under sail and steam
combined. The names of these are the ' Colossus,' ' Chesapeake,' ' Flying

    3. Return of the London and North- Western Railway Company's steamboat
' Cambria's ' trials and ordinarj' performances as originally built, and after being
lengthened ; also of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company's vessels ' Lima
and 'Bogota,' when fitted with original and other machinery ; also of the new
cargo boat, the ' Admiral Moorsom.'

    4. Returns of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's boats ' Colombo,'
· Candia,' ' Ceylon,' ' Delta,' ' Nubia,' and ' Pera,' when on voyages between
Southampton and Alexandria, and between Suez and Bombay respectively,
together with particulars of their machinery and hulls furnished by the
builders and engineers.

   5. Returns of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company's vessels ' Guaya-
quil ' and ' Valparaiso,' with particulars of trials and sea voyages during 1860.

    6. Returns of the trials of the vessels ' Leouidas,' ' Mavrocordato,' ' Pene-
lope,' furnished by Messrs. Morrison and Co., and the ' Thunder ' and 'Midge,'

and Kingstown, (Table 5.)
                 ON STEAM-SHIP PERFORMANCE.                            197

 --13. Diagrams or indicator cards* have been received, taken from the fol-

lowing ships : ' Cambria,' ' Admiral Moorsom,' ' Leinster ' and ' Ulster,' ' Co-

lombo ' (lengthened), ' Nubia,' and ' Thunder.'

The sura of £150 voted by the Council of the Association to defray the

expenses of the Committee has been expended, and the statement of the ex-

penditure, which could not be prepared in time for publication with this Re-

port, will be presented by the Committee at the Meeting.

Wm.The thanks of the Committee are especially due to Mr.  Smith, C.E.,

a member of the Committee, for the large amount of assistance he has ren-

dered in collecting information, as also by placing a room in his offices at the

disposal of the Committee.

Your Committee, in conclusion, have the painful duty to record the death

of their late Chairman, Admiral Moorsom, and the regret which they have

felt at the melancholy event which has deprived them of their Chairman, and

their sense of the great loss which has thus been sustained bj^ your Associa-

tion and by the scientific world at large, as well as by the distinguished pro-

fession to which he belonged.

 Preliminary Report on the Best Mode of Preventing the Ravages of

   Teredo and other Animals in our Ships and Harbours. By J. Gwyn

    Jeffreys, F.R.S., F.G.S.

 Since the last meeting, Mr. Jeffreys vent to Holland for the purpose of
investigating the experiments which are being made there, under the direction
 of the Academy of Sciences at Amsterdam, and with the sanction of the
 Dutch Government, in order to check the destructive ravages of the Teredo
 marina; and he was accompanied by Dr. Verloren, of Utrecht, another
member of the Committee. The progress of these different experiments is
periodically and carefully recorded ; but it will take many years before the
result can be shown. From an elaborate report of the Dutch Commission,
published last year, and which was placed by M. Van der Hoeven in Mr.
 Jeffreys's hands, it appears that no efficacious remedy had at that time been
discovered. Even the expensive process of creosoting the timber failed in
one instance where the piece of wood thus treated was in contact with another
piece which had not been creosoted ; the Teredo having indiscriminately per-
 forated both pieces of wood, first attacking the unrreosoted wood. Mr. Jef-
freys had also lately seen a piece of wood used in the construction of harbour
works at Scrabster, which, although it had been creosoted to the extent of
 10 pounds to the square foot (having been first dressed and cut), was exca-
vated on every side by the Limnoria lignorum. Iron-headed or scupper nails
afford very little protection, as the Teredo and Lii^moria work their way even
through the rust, unless it is very thick, the valves of the Teredo becoming
stained in consequence. The remedy suggested by Mr. Jeffreys (viz. a coating
of some siliceous or mineral composition) had not been tried in Holland or

France. Among other communications received by Mr. Jeffreys on the sub-

ject was one from Mr. William Hutton, of Sunderland, who had recently

taken out a patent " for preventing the destruction of timber from the action

of marine animals." His process is to force into the wood a soluble silex, or
water glass, with muriate of lime. If this process is not expensive, it would
no doubt answer the desired purpose ; but it is probable that the same object
would be attained by merely soaking the wood in a solution of this kind, or
even laying it on the wood with a brush. It would seem to be sufficient if the
outer layer of the wood were coated or glazed in such a manner that the
composition would not crack or peel off.

    Although the different kinds of Teredo are locally and partially distributed
on our coasts, the wood-boring Crustacea (and especially Limnoria lignorum)
occur everywhere in countless numbers, and on the whole do the greatest
damage to our harbour works. Mr. Jeffreys endeavoured to obtain, through

a member of the Committee who resided at Plymouth, permission from the
Admiralty to institute some experiments in the Dockyard there, having been
informed that very considerable damage had been sustained in that port
during many years past from the last-mentioned cause. But, although a
copy of the Association's Proceedings was furnished to the First Lord and

Secretary to the Admiralty, and the Port- Admiral expressed his approval of
the experiments being tried, and forwarded the application to the Admiralty,
permission was refused. It does not appear that the Admiralty or Govern-
ment have taken any steps to prevent further loss, or even to inquire into the

matter.

    Notwithstanding this discouragement, Mr. Jeffreys will persevere, with the
assistance of the other members of the Committee, in doing all that is possible
to ensure such an important and national object as the protection of our ships
and harbours from the destructive attacks of these animals.

ON THE TRANSIT-VELOCITY OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES. 201

Report of the Experiments made at Holyhead {North Wales) to ascer-
   tain the Transit- Velocity of Waves, analogous to Earthquake Waves,
  through the local Rock Formations : by command of the Royal Society

  and of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. By
  Robert Mallet, C.E., F.R.S.

In my " Second Report on the Facts of Earthquake Phenomena," in the

Report of the British Association for 1851, the transit- velocities were expe-
rimentally determined of waves of impulse produced by the explosion of
charges of gunpowder, and these velocities shown to be

In wet sand                      824-915 feet per second,
In discontinuous granite ....  130C)'4'25 feet per second,
In more solid granite          1664"574 feet per second,

the range of sand employed having been that of Killiney Strand, and of
granite that of Dalkey Island, both on the east coast of Ireland. These

results produced some surprise on my own part, as well as on that of others,

the transit-velocities obtained falling greatly below those which theory might
have suggested as possible, based upon the modulus of elasticity of the

material constituting the range in either case.
    I suggested as the explanation of the low velocities ascertained, that the

media of the ranges (like all the solids constituting the crust of the earth) were
not in fact united and homogeneous elastic solids, but an aggregation of solids
more or less shattered, heterogeneous, and discontinuous; and that to the loss
of vis viva, and of time in the propagation of the wave from surface to sur-
face, was due the extremely low velocities observed.

   The correctness of this view, and a general corroboration of the correct-
ness of the experimental results themselves, have since been made known by
the careful determinations by Nbggerath and Schmidt respectively, of the

transit-velocities of actual earthquake waves in the superficial formations of
the Rhine country and of Hungary, and by myself in those of Southern Italy,

all of which present low velocities coordinating readily with my previous

experimental results.

    In the Report above mentioned, I suggested the desirableness of extending
the experimental determination of wave-transit to stratified and foliated

rocks, as likely to present still lower velocities than those obtained for shat-

tered granite, as well as other important or suggestive phenomena. The
operations in progress at the Government quarries at Holyhead (Island of
Anglesea, North Wales), of dislodging vast masses of rock by means of gun-
powder for the formation of the Asylum Harbour there, appeared to me to
present a favourable opportunity of making some experiments upon the stra-

tified rock formations of that locality, by taking advantage of the powerful
explosions necessary at the quarries. These quarries are situated (see Map,
PI. II.) on Holyhead Mountain, on its N.E. flank, in metamorphic quartz
rock, and in 1852 (a vast mass of material having been already removed)
presented a lofty, irregular, and nearly vertical scarp, reaching to 150 feet in
height above the floor of the quarry in some places.

    From this wall of solid rock the process of dislodgement was continued,
not by the usual method of blasting, by means of small charges fired in
jumper-holes bored into the rock, but by the occasional explosion of large
mines, containing at times as much as ni)ie tons of gunpowder lodged in one
or in three or more separate foci deep within the face of the clifi", and formed

by driving " headings" or galleries from the base of the mural face into the

rock. From the charges of powder placed in bags at the innermost extre-

mities of these headings, which were stopped up by several feet of " tamping '*
202 REPORT-- 1861.

 of stone, rubbish, and clay, conducting wires were led out to a suitable and safe
distance, so that on making by these the circuit complete between the poles of a
powerful Smee's galvanic batterj', a small piece of thin platinum wire adjusted
within the charge of gunpowder became heated, and ignited the powder.
The explosion thus followed instantaneously the making contact between the

 poles of the battery.

    Experience has enabled the engineers charged with the work so exactly
to proportion the charge of powder to the work it is intended to perform in
each case, that no rock is thrown to any distance; the whole force is consumed
in dislocating and dropping down to its base as a vast sloping talus of disrupted
rock and stone the portion of the cliff operated on ; in fact, at the moment
of explosion the mass of previously solid rock seems to fall to pieces like
a lump of suddenly slacked quicklime. The shock or impulse, however,
delivered by the explosion upon the remaining solid rock, behind and around
the focus, and propagated through it in all directions outwards, as an elastic
wave of impulse, was at an early stage of the operations remarked to be so
powerful, that it could be felt distinctly in the quaking of the ground at
distances of several hundred yards, and was sufficient even to shake down
articles of delf ware from the shelves of cottages a long way off from the

quarries.

    Early in 1853 I visited those quarries, and examined generally the adja-
cent locality and rock formations, and having satisfied myself that these

operations could be made available, I applied to my distinguished friend, the

late lamented Mr. Rendel, C.E., the engineer-in-chief of the Asylum Harbour,
and readily obtained from him permission to make such experiments as should

not interfere with the progress of the works.

   The prosecution of these experiments having been favourably represented
to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and to the Council
of the Royal Society, a sum of money was voted by each of these bodies

respectively, and placed at the author's disposal, with the desire that he should
undertake and conduct the experiments.

   It was not, however, until the summer of 1856 that my own avocations and

various preliminaries allowed any progress to be made with the experiments
themselves. Negotiations had to be entered on with several parties ; with
the occupier of some land at Pen-y-Brin, about a mile to the east of the
quarries, where the most suitable spot for placing the seismoscope (the obser-
ver's station O, see Map) was found, for permission to enter his land, and level
down to a horizontal surface the face of the rock here occupying the sur-
face of the ground, and to erect an observer's shed over it; and with the
Electric Telegraph Company, for the hire of insulating telegraph poles and

wires, and for their erection over the range intervening between this spot
and the highest reach of the quarry hill.

   As these great blasts are fired only occasionally and at uncertain intervals,

and being prepared must he fired without postponement, and within a given
hour of the day, namely, during the workmen's dinner-hour (12 to 1 p.m.),
when the quarries are clear of men,and therefore safe from accident, it became

at once obvious that very frequent journeys, both on my own part and on that

of such assistants as I should require, would have necessarily to be made to
and from Holyhead ; and to economize as much as possible the large expen-
diture that must thus arise, I applied to the City of Dublin Steam Packet
Company, and to the Chester and Holyhead Railway Company, through

their respective Secretaries, representing the scientific character of the un-
dertaking, and requesting on their parts cooperation, by their permitting

myself and my assistants, with any needful apparatus, to pass free to and
ON THE TRANSIT-VELOCITY OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES. 203

from Holyhead by their respective vessels from Kingstown Harbour. After

much fruitless correspondence I regret to say that both these Companies

refused to render any assistance whatever, a boon the refusal of which

greatly increased the expenditure for these experiments. Lastly, I placed

myself in communication with Messrs. Rigby, the contractors for the vast

works of the Quarries and Harbour, and in August 1856 received from them

the assurance of every assistance that they could afford consistently with the

prosecution of the works. To them, to Mr. R. L. Cousens, C.E., the acting

engineer for their firm on the works, and to Mr. G. C. Dobson, C.E., chief

engineer on the work under Mr. Rendel (since under Mr. Hawkshaw), my

thanks are due for the best and most cordial assistance upon all occasions.

The position for the observer's station and seismoscope upon the levelled

floor of rock at Pen-y-Brin having been fixed upon, the first operation neces-

sary was to obtain an accurate section of the surface in the line between that

and the quarries, a geological section of the rock formations along the same

line, and with precision the exact distance in a straight line, from some fixed

point adjacent to the quarries, to the observer's station. The fixed point

chosen at the quarries was the flagstaff at the bell, which is rung whenever

a blast is about to be fired, this being so placed that from it measurements
O Wand angular bearings, with the line of range
                                                  (Map), from the various

sites of future explosions could readily be made, and thus the exact distance

of each focus of explosion (to be hereafter experimented on) from the seismo-

Oscope at  ascertained, the flagstaff always remaining undisturbed as a

Ofixed terminal at the quarry end of the range. The whole surface, to W,

was carefully levelled over, and the distances chained, as given in the diagram,

PI. III. section 2. fig. 1. The roughness of the ground and its inclination,

however, rendered direct measurement of the range of wave-path with suf-

ficient accuracy impracticable, and it was found necessary to obtain it trigo-

nometrically. For this purpose a base line of 1432 feet in length was mea-

sured off along the rails of the tramroad which connects the quarry with the

Aeast breakwater, between the points and B (Map, PI. II.), where the road

fortunately was found straight and nearly level.

This was measured with two brass-shod pine rods, each of 35 feet in length,

of the same sort, and applied in the same manner, as I used in 1849 for

measuring the base of one mile on Killiney Strand, for the particulars of

which the " Second Report on Earthquakes," &c.. Report Brit. Assoc.

Wbackwards, with a result differing by less than 3 inches. The flagstaff at the

spot marked in the Map is not visible from the observer's station, owing

to some intervening houses and other objects ; a staff was therefore set up at

OS, upon the hill-side. The point was connected by angular measurements

constant part of the range between the observing station and the flagstaff, its

other permanent terminal, as equal to 4585 (eet, neglecting fractions.

The base of the staff at S was found to be 68'78 feet above the level of

Wthe horizontal surface of the rock at Pen-y-Brin (the observing station O),
and the base of the flagstaff at        is 5*70 feet above the same point O.

OThe levelled surface of rock at is 84 feet above the mean tide-level of the

sea in the Asylum Harbour ; and the average rise and fall of spring tides at

Holyhead is 18 feet; the line of rock, therefore, through which the range

passes is, except as respects surface water, permanently dry to a considerable

depth. The majority of the headings are driven into the face of the quarry

cliff horizontally, at from 10 to 20 feet above the level of the floor of the

quarry, which is on nearly the same level as the point W. Hence, prac-

tically, the actual range of transmission through the solid rock of the impulse

from each heading when fired, to the seismoscope at the observer's station,

may be considered as a horizontal line, and no correction of distance is

required for difference of elevation at the two extremities of the observing-

range in the reduction of our results.

   The Island of Holyhead, as may be seen on consulting the sheets (Nos. 77

and 78) of the Geological Survey of England and Wales, consists mainly of
chloritic and micaceous schist or slate and of quartz rock. The latter forms

the north-west portion of the island ; and in it alone are situated the Harbour
quarries, upon the side of Holyhead Mountain (as it is called), the same

rock rising to its summit, which is 742 feet above the sea, mean tide-level.

The junction of the quartz and of the schist or slate rock runs in azimuth

N. 24° E. where it crosses the line of our range, which it intersects at an
angle horizontally of 73° 30'.

The schist or slate rocks here overlie the quartz, abutting against the flank

of the latter, apparently unconformably, and having an inclined junction whose

dip is towards the south-east, and probably, at the place where our range

intersects, having an angle of dip of about 65° with the vertical. The point of

Wjunction is situated about 900 feet from the flagstaff ; so that about 2100

feet, on the average, of our actual ranges lay in quartz rock, and the re-

mainder, or 3750 feet, in the schist or slate formation, taking the mean total
range at 5851 feet. The general tendency of the schist is to a dip to the north-

west, varying from 5° to 20° from the horizontal ; but no well-defined bedding

is obvious either in it or in the quartz.

Lithologically, the quartz rock consists of very variable proportions of pure

white, light grey, and yellowish quartz, and of white or yellowish-white

aluminous and finally micaceous clays. In many places the mass of the rock

presents to the lens almost nothing but clear and translucent quartz, breaking

with a fine waved glassy fracture, striking fire with steel, extremely hard

and difficult to break, and showing a very ill-defined crystallization of the

individual particles of quartz, which have all the appearance of pure quartzose

sea-sand that had become agglutinated by heat and pressure coacting with

some slight admixture of the nature of a flux. The specific gravity of such

portions, as determined for me by my friend Mr. Robert H. Scott, A.M.,

Secretary to the Geological Society of Dublin, is 2*658. From this the rock
passes in many places into a softer and more friable material, consisting, when

minutely examined, of the same sort of quartz-grains, with a white pulveru-

lent clay, containing microscopic plates of mica disseminated between them
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

this fractures readily, but will still strike fire with steel, and its average spe-

cific gravity is 2'650.

Both, but particularly the harder variety, are found often in very thick

masses of nearly uniform quality, separated by great master-joints, though

scarcely to be considered as beds ; but usually the mass, viewed in the large,
is heterogeneous in the highest degree, massive and thick in one place, full
of joints and even minutely foliated in others, and everywhere intersected by
thin and thick veins of harder quartz, agglutinated sand, and, elsewhere,
friable sand, and of soft sandy clay.

   Both the quartz rock and the schist of the island are intersected by three
great greenstone dykes (of inconsiderable thickness, however), none of them
interfering with our range, and by one or more great faults, all of which
run through nearly the whole island in a N.W. and S.E. direction, and by
numerous other minor faults and dislocations, some of which may be seen
as cutting through our line of range ^A f, g, k, I, in Plate III. section 2.
No. 11.

   At a short distance behind the quarry cliff, and seat of our several ex-

--plosions, a great clay dyke occurs in the quartz rock a wall, in fact, of.

about 20 feet in average thickness, running in the direction marked on the

Map (Plate II.), and with a dip of only about 20" from the vertical.

This consists of strongly compacted clay, nearly pure white, and more or
less mixed with fine sand and grains of mica, but cannot be called rock,
though continually passing into stony masses. Lying as it does in rear of our
experimental headings, it was of some value, as presenting a dead solid anvil
to the pulse from each explosion, in the contrary direction to that of the
observed wave of impulse, and hence causing a larger and more distinctly
appreciable wave to be transmitted in the direction towards the seismoscope.

   The schist rock, in colour, passes from fawn-colour and light-greenish

ashen-grey into a rather dark tea-green. It owes its colour to disseminated
thin layers of chlorite, and probably of black or green mica in minute scales,
between which are thicker layers of quartz, presenting identically the same
mineral characters as those of the quartz rock beneath. These layers, owing
to the small relative hardness and cohesion of the chlorite and mica, present
planes of weakness and of separation ; the rock is, in fact, everywhere thinly
foliated, the average thickness of a plate seldom exceeding 0*2 of an inch, and
averaging about one-half that thickness. These foliations are twisted, bent,
doubled up, and distorted in every conceivable way : the contortions are
often large, the curves having radii of some feet, with minor distortions
within and upon them ; but most commonly they are small ; so that it is rare
to get even a hand specimen presenting flat and undistorted foliations, while,

quite commonly, hand specimens may be found presenting, within a cube of

four or five inches, two or three curves of contrary flexure, often in all three
axes, and with curvatures short, sharp, and abrupt, almost angular. There
is a general tendency observable in the greater convolutions to conform more
or less to the surface contour of the country ; so that the largest and flattest
folds are found to occupy, with an approach to horizontality, the topmost por-
tions of the great humps or umbos of schist rock that form the characteristic
of the landscape, and so rolling off in folds smaller, steeper, and more con-
voluted towards the steeper sides, as though these masses had slipped and
doubled upon themselves when soft and pasty.

    Occasionally, however, where deep cuttings have exposed the interior of
such surface-knolls, it is found sharply convoluted and twisted in all direc-
tions, and without any relation to the existing surface of the country. Every-
where this mass of minutely structured, convoluted, and foliated rock is cut
through by joints of separation, with surfaces in direct and close contact, and
by thin seams and veins of hard and sometimes pretty well crystallized quartz,

now and then discoloured by oxide of iron, and with minute cavities filled

with chlorite and mica, and with others of agglutinated quartzose sand, whose
                    ;

boundirig-lines pass off rapidly, hut ffradatim, into the prevailing substance of
the rock. It is by no means of equal hardness ; some portions (and these
occur without any order or traceable relationship throughout the mass) are

much thinner in the foliation, and the layers of chlorite and mica nearly as

thick as those of the intervening quai'tz, both being so attenuated, that to
the naked eye the edge of the foliation presents only a fine streaky appearance

of lighter and darker green-grey tint. The softest, however, readily strikes
fire with steel, and throughout the whole mass of the rock (for the length of

our range) it is so hard, coherent, and intractable as to be only capable of
being quarried by the aid of gunpowder, and with very closely formed

jumper-holes.

   The specific gravity of the densest portions of the schist rock reaches 2'7G5

that of the softer averages 2'7i6. When the rock, whether hard or soft, is

broken so that the applied surfaces of the foliations are visible, they are
often found glistening and greasy to the feel, from flattened microscopic

scales of mica, or possibly of talc.

   The quartz rock fractures under the effect of gunpowder into great lumpy
masses, with much small rubbish; the schist under that, from jumper-hole
blasts, breaks up into coarse, angular, knotted, and most irregular wedges,
the foliations breaking across in irregularly receding steps, and (throughout
our range at least) a stone with a single flat bed being perhaps unprocurable.
Both rocks are absolutely dry, or free from all perceptible percolations of

surface-water issuing as springs, nor does the rain penetrate their substance

--by absorption for any appreciable depth, both indications of their generally

compact structure.
    The faults with which our range is intersected, in four places, at a hori-

zontal angle of about 75°, are not far from vertical, dipping a few degrees to

the N.W. They occur at the points marked f,ff, k, I, on the Geological Sec-

tion (Plate III. section 2) ; and the disturbed and shattered plate of rock
between each pair I'espectively appears to have sustained a downthrow (or
the rocks at either side the contrary) of a few feet, 10 to 12 probably.
The surfaces of the walls of these faults, so far as I can judge from rather
imperfect superficial indications, appear to be in close contact ; and such is the

character of all the small faults that intersect the formation hereabouts.
    I have been thus tediously minute in describing the character of the rocks

throughout our range, because, if experimental determinations of earth-wave
transit are to become useful elements of comparison in the hands of the seis-
mologists of other countries with the observed transit-times of natural earth-
quake-waves, and a means of controlling such observations, it is essential
that the means be afforded of accurately comparing the rock-formation tra-

versed in both cases.

   From what has been described, it will be remarked that the rock here

chosen for experiment presents in the highest degree the properties capable

of producing dispersion, delay, and rapid extinction of the wave of impulse,
so far as its structure is concerned, although the modulus of elasticity of a
very large proportion of its mineral constituents (silex) is extremely high, and
its specific gravity as great as that of Dalkey granite. Added to its minutely
foliated and mineralogically heterogeneous character, with its multiplied con-
volutions, we have five great planes of transverse separation in the range, one
of these forming the plane of junction of the quartz and schist, with innume-
rable minor planes of separation at all conceivable angles to each other in
both rocks ; and yet we have highly elastic and dense materials forming the
substance of both rocks, and their general mass remarkably free from open

veins, fissures, or cavities.

        ON THE TRANSIT-VELOCITY OP EARTHQUAKE WAVES. 207

    "We have also two different rocks, the one transmitting the impulse into
the other, yet neither so widely differing from the other in molecular and other
physical characters as to make any great or abrupt effect upon the wave at
the junction probable. In fact, widely, to the first glance, as the quartz
rock and the schist rock appear to differ, there is less real distinction
of physical character between them than would be supposed : both are
composed of the same siliceous sand in about the same size of original
grains, variously enveloped, in the one in chlorite and mica, and in the
other in white or grey clay and mica; both have, in ancient geological
epochs, doubtless derived their materials by degradation and transport from

a common source, as respects their main constituent, the silex ; both have

been submitted to approximately similar pressures, and probably like tem-
peratures ; and the agglutinating flux has probably been mainly the same for
both, viz. the minute proportions of alkalies derived from the waters of an
ancient ocean. The main difference in physical structure, viewed upon the
broad scale, between the quartz rock and the slate is this (as regards our

--experiments) : that the great joints and planes of separation on the whole

approximate to verticaliiy in the former, while in the latter, with the ex-
ception of some larger faults and dykes, the planes of separation are twisted
and involved in all directions, but tend more to approach horizontality

   More interesting conditions could thus scarcely be found for experimental
determination of the transit-rate of earth-waves, or more desirable for future
comparison with that of earthquake-waves themselves ; much more instructive,
indeed, were the actual conditions than if the means of experiment presented

by these vast quarry operations had been in the most regular, undisturbed,
and horizontal stratified rock, like some of the mountain limestone of Ireland,
or the finest and densest laminated roofing-slates of Wales. In such ranges
we can predict that the transit-velocity would at least be high. In the

medium chosen for these experiments it was impossible even to guess what it

might be found.

   I proceed to describe the instrumental arrangements made for the observa-
tion of the impulse-wave transmitted from the blasts chosen, and for the de-
termination of the transit-time along the range of wave-path. Over the
surface of solid rock that had been chiselled down to a level tabular surface
at (O) Pen-y-Brin, a timber-shed was erected, of sufficient size to place the
observer, an assistant, and all the instruments proper to that spot, under cover
and secured from the wind. The side to the N.W. was open, to permit of
observation along the line of range, with the means of partially closing it in

high winds.

   Along the line of the boundary-wall of the railway next Pen-y-Brin,
and thence along up to the highest and most distant point of the quarry
cliffs, a line of telegraph-posts was planted, and upon these two properly
insulated iron wires were hung, in such a manner that at any point along
their length over the quarry cliffs, a pair of branch wires (covered' with
gutta percha) could be led off, and in like manner another pair to the appa-
ratus in the observing-shed at Pen-y-Brin, thus giving the means of galva-
nically connecting the extremities of the range in any way that might be

required.

   The mines in use at the quarries frequently consist of two, three, or four

separate chambers and charges, which are all fired simultaneously (see PI. IV.);
but each charge is fired by a distinct pair of wires, igniting a fine platinum

wire interposed in the circuit and immersed in one of the powder-bags. The
arrangement of this platinum wire in its hollow wooden frame to prevent

disturbance, and its connexion with the large conducting wires, are practi-
208 REPORT-- 1861.

cally the same as those adopted by me in 1849 at Killiney, and will be

found fully described in " Second Report on Earthquakes," &c., Report of
British Association for 1851, p. 277.

   When several charges are to be fired simultaneously, all the electro-

positive wires from each chamber are collected into one mercury-cup in
connexion with one pole of the batlery, and all the electro-negative wires
into another mercury-cup. Upon making contact between the latter and
the second pole of the battery, the current at the same moment ignites all
the platinum wires passing through each pair of wires as a separate con-
ducting path. This method requires considerable battery power, but is the
only certain or reliable one for firing simultaneously a number of separate

charges. When an attempt is made to pass the current from one pole of

the battery through a single pair of wires, and through all the fine platinum
priming wires in succession to the return pole, there is extreme risk that the
first or second platinum priming, owing to its attenuated section of wire (in

virtue of which indeed alone it becomes ignited at all), may interpose so
much resistance to the current as to prevent the ignition of the third, or
fourth, or other subsequent primings, or that the first priming-wire may

get absolutely fused or broken by the first-ignited powder, and so cut off all
communication with the others before they have been heated sufficiently.

  A neglect of this obvious consequence of Ohm's law of resistance

appears to have been the cause of failure very recently, in an attempt to

ignite a number of mines of demolition simultaneously, at Chatham. From

the great magnitude of the charges frequently fired at Holyhead, and the
very serious consequences that failure of ignition would involve, the battery
power habitually employed is wisely of superabundant power. It consists
of a Grove's battery of thirty-two cells, each exposing ninety-six square

inches of platinum element. It is but justice to my friend Mr. R. L. Cou-
sens, C.E., to whose assistance in these experiments I am so much indebted,

to add, that during the several years he has controlled these vast blasting-

operations a single failure of ignition has never occurred.
    For the above reasons, and from the necessity that in the event of any

failure of such apparatus as I might require for experiment, in making
contact and firing the mine at a given moment, the power should still be
reserved to Mr. Cousins to fire it directly afterwards in the usual way, so as
not to interfere with the works, I was led, finally, to devise the following
magneto-galvanic arrangement, by which, at a signal given from tlie sum-
mit of the quarry cliff (where the firing-battery is usually placed, nearly
above the mine or heading then to be fired, and at a safe distance back
from the edge of the cliff, usually about 100 yards) that all was ready, I
should myself, stationed at the observing-shed (O), be enabled to com-
plete the contact and fire the mine, and do so in such a way as to register
by means of the chronograph the interval of time that elapsed between
the moment that I so made contact (or fired) and the arrival of the wave
of impulse through the rocks of the range or wave-path, when made visible

by, and observed by me in, the seismoscope.

   For this purpose such an arrangement was required as, upon contact

being made by me at the observing-shed (O), should set in motion such a

contrivance, situated upon the quarry cliff, at the remote end of the tele-
graph wires, as should there instantly close the poles of the great (Grove's)
firing-battery and so fire the mine, and in the event from any cause of this
result not taking place at the preconcerted moment, that then it should be
free to Mr. Cousens or his assistants to close the poles of the firing-battery by
baud in the ordinary way.

   In PI. IV., in which (fig. 1) this arrangement is figured (without reference

Ato scale), is one of the headings seen in the clifF-face at part of the quarries.

Above the Bcliff at is placed the Grove's firing-battery; the conducting

wires from its poles pass down the face of the cliff and into the heading,

uniting at the platinum priming-wire in the midst of the charge of powder,

tlie further end of tlie wires terminating in mercury-cups at the contact-

maker C (about to be described). From the electro-magnet of the contact-

maker, the two insulated wires are led along upon telegraph poles from

the summit of the cliflT down to the observer's station at Pcn-y-Brin, where

they terminate also in mercury-cups, one forming the e+ and the other
the e-- pole of the contact-making battery E placed there. This battery

consisted of six of the usual moistened-sand batteries in use for telegraph

purposes.

The chronograph (D) was placed upon the levelled rock adjacent to this

battery, and conveniently for its lever (m) being acted on by the left hand of

the observer, when lying at full length upon the ground, with his eye to

the seismoscope based upon the rock at F, its optic axis being situated in

the vertical plane of the line of wave-patli or range F A, close to the

Aseismoscope, and at the same level as the eyepiece of that instrument.

very good achromatic telescope was adjusted upon its stand, so as to bring

the heading about to be experimented on, together with the whole face of

--the cliff and the firing-battery, ^-c, within its field, the eyepiece of this

telescope being fixed at about a distance of 6 or 8 inches from that of the

seismoscope, and so that the eye of the observer, while lying at ease and

with the left hand upon the lever of the chronograph (m), could be instantly

transferred from the one instrument to the other. In this state of things,
when the proper signal (by the exhibition of a red flag) was made, and at a

preconcerted time as nearly as was practicable, by those stationed at the
firing-battery at B, that " all was ready," I applied ray eye to the seismoscope,

and pressed down the lever (m) of the chronograph with a sharp rapid move-

ment                       this  instantly  closed  the  poles  of the  contact-making battery  C,  causing
                        ;

the galvanic current to pass through the electro-magnets of the contact-maker

away at the quarries at C. This directly closed the poles of the Grove's firing-

battery at B, and fired the mine. The moment I observed the arrival of

Athe wave of impulse propagated through the range from the explosion at

in the seismoscope at F, I withdrew my hand from the lever of the chro-

nograph (m), and thus stopped the instrument, the interval of time between

its having been started and stopped thus registering the (uncorrected) time

Aof transit of the wave for the distance F. It will now be necessary briefly

to describe the several instruments separately. The seismoscope and chro-

nograph have been already fully described in the account of the experi-
ments made in 18i9 at Killiney and Dalkey (Second Report on Earthquakes,

&c.. Report of Brit. Assoc. 1851), to which reference may be made.

Briefly, the seismoscope (fig. 3*, PI. IV.) consists of a cast-iron base-plate,

on the centre ofthe surface ofwhich is placed an accurately formed trough (b),

12 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches deep, containing an inch in

depth of pure mercury, with its surface free from oxide or dust, so as to

reflect properly. The longer axis of this trough is placed in the direc-

tion of the wave-path, the base of the instrument being level. At the

opposite end of the trough are placed standards with suitable adjustments

that at the end next the centre of impulse carries a tube (c), provided with

an achromatic object-glass at its lower end, and a pair of cross wires (hori-

zontal and vertical); its optic axis is adjusted to 45° incidence with the

reflecting surface of mercury in the trough. At the other end of the trough

1861.                                                                                           P
--210 REPORT 1861.

an achromatic telescope (a) with a single wire is similarly adjusted, so that

when the moveable blackened cover (e e) is placed over the trough, &c., no
light can reach the surface of the mercury except through the tube c. The
image of the cross wires in the latter is therefore seen through the tele-
scope a, clearly reflected and defined in the surface of the mercury, so long as
the fluid metal remains absolutely at rest ; but the moment the slightest
vibration or disturbance is by any means communicated to the instrument,
the surface of the fluid mirror is disturbed, and the image is distorted,
or generally disappears totally. The telescope magnifies 11*39 times
linearly, and the total magnifying power of the instrument to exalt the

manifestation to the eye of any slight disturbance of the mercurial mirror is
nearly twenty-three times. Its actual sensibility is extremely great. In
the present case, however, this was not needful, as the impulse transmitted
from these powerful explosions produced in all cases the most complete
obliteration of the image, and in those of the most powerful mines experi-
mented on caused a movement in the mercury of the trough that would

have been visible to the naked eye. Indeed, in that of the S-ith Novem-
ber, 1860, the amplitude of the wave that reached the seismoscope was so
great as to cause the mercury to sway forwards and backwards in the trough

to a depth that might have been measured.
    After the earth-wave has reached This instrument, a certain interval of

time is necessary for the production of the wave in the mercury, and for its
transit from the end of the trough next c, where it is produced, to the mid-
length where it is observed. This involves a correction in the gross transit-
time as observed with it. For the methods by which the constant for this
(seismoscope correction) was determined I must refer again to Report of
Brit. Assoc. 1851, pp. 280, 281. It amounts to 0"'065 in time ; and as the

eflect of this will in every observation appear to delay the arrival of the

earth-wave at the instrument, this constant in time, converted into distance,
must be added to the rate of wave-transit otherwise obtained.

   The chronograph (originally devised by Wheatstone) is shown in fig. 1*,
PI. IV. It consists, in fact, of a small and finely made clock, deprived of its
pendulum, but provided with a suitable detent (shown more at large in
fig. 4*), by which the action of the weight upon it is kept always arrested,
but can immediately be permitted to take place in giving it motion, upon
pressing the band quickly upon the lever g.

   The running down of the weight causes the anchor and pallets of the

escapement (k) rapidly to pass the teeth of the escapement-wheel («), so that

the clock " runs down " by a succession of minute descents ; and thus the
motion is practically a uniform one. It follows that as more weight is added
this velocity becomes greater, and by such addition the instrument may be
made to measure more and more minute fractions of time.

    It registers time upon two dials (fig. 2*), each with an index : one of these is
fixed on the axis of the escapement-wheel (a), and its dial is divided into thirty
smaller and six larger divisions ; the pinion on this axis is to the wheel
upon the weight-barrel (5) as 1 : 12. This carries the other index, and its dial
has twelve divisions, so that one of its divisions corresponds to an entire
revolution of the former one. The value in actual mean time due to the
movement of the instrument, as thus recorded, requires to be ascertained by
reference to a clock beating seconds, so that the number of revolutions of
the index b, and parts of revolutions of that of a, during an interval of, say,

30 seconds, may be determined by the mean of several experiments. For

the methods of performing this with the necessary correctness, I again refer to

ON THE TRANSIT-VELOCITY OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES. 211

" Second Report on Earthquakes," &c., Report of Brit. Assoc. 1851, pp. 287,

289, &c.

   On the present occasion, as a considerable time elapsed between the suc-

cessive experiments, during which the oil on the instrument more or less
changed its state, and as some were made in summer and others in winter,
it became necessary to rate the chronograph anew for each experiment, or
at least to verify the former rating ; for this end it was necessary to provide
a suitable loud-beating seconds clock with a divided arc to the pendulum, as
none such could be procured at Holyhead. The same weight was con-
.stantly used with the chronograph, and the extreme differences found in
the rating during the several years that these experiments have been in

progress were no more than the following :

=Nov. 1856. Value in mean time of one division of the dial (a)  //

                                                                0*01485

May 186]. Value of same      = 0-01806

   Taking for illustration the former value of the smallest division of the
dial (a), we see that each division of the dial (J)) is equal to one revolution of
the index (a), and equal to

                  =0"-01485 X 30 0"-4455,

and one revolution of the index (&) equal to

                  =0"-4455 X 12 5"-346,--

an absolute rate of movement of the instrument not widely differing from
that employed in the experiments of Killiney and Dalkey, with which it is
desirable that the present results should be comparable. Half a small divi-
sion of the chronograph can be read ; we therefore in these experiments

possess the means of recording time to within 0"*0074', or to nearly y^'^'o^ths

of a second.

   The additional apparatus of the chronograph consisted merely of such
arrangements that the releasing lever {g), when pressed down by the hand
applied to the wood insulator at m, should dip at i into a mercury-cup, and
so make contact by the wires (h, b') between the poles of the contact-making

battery (E).

    It remains to describe the contact-maker (fig. 2, PI. IV.). c is the base of

the instrument of mahogany, carrying a vertical and bent arm (d) of cast
iron, into the upper forked end of which the central iron bars, of about |^ths
of an inch in diameter, of the electro-magnets a, a (seen in plan in fig. 3) are
secured by a cotter ; the coils of covered wire round these are continuous,

the wire (b) from the e+ pole passing at its further end from the first coil
e--over to the second, and at the extremity of the latter passing off to the pole

by b', the junctions being effected by mercury-cups in the usual way. n is
a sliding piece of wood, secured upon the base c when adjusted in place by
the screw at s ; this carries a wrought-iron lever armature (c), whose arms
are as 8 : 1, the shorter and rather heavier end being adjusted so as to be
beneath the poles of the electro-magnets, and at such a distance beneath
them that, upon passing the current through the coils, the magnets shall

readily attract the short end of this lever, snatch it up into contact with the
poles of the magnets, and in doing so depress the other or remote end of
the lever. The latter extremity of the lever is provided, as seen more at
large in figs. 4 and 5, with a forked pair of copper poles amalgamated,
which, when depressed by the action of the electro-magnets, dip into the mer-
cury of the cups/ and/, and in doing so close the holes of the firing-battery,
the conducting wires from which {h and Ji) dip respectively into mercury-
cups, which by a ttibe bored through the wood are in permanent communi-

cation with /and/ (cups) respectively. The lever and forked poles, &c.,

                                                                                                                    1'2

are provided with various screw adjustments as to position, range, &c., and

a slender spring beneath the lever, ensuring that it shall not be accidentally

moved by wind, or other cause, until acted on by the powerful grasp of the

magnets.

This instrument was found to answer admirably well. It may be observed,

in passing, that it gives the means of exploding mines at almost any distance

through telegraphic Avires, and by any moderate contact-making power, and

may admit of valuable applications hereafter for the explosion, at a determi-

nate instant, of mines for purposes of warfare.

 --It is obvious that a certain loss of time must occur at this contact-maker,

in reference to our experiments that, in fact, the total time registered by

Dthe chronograph at  is too great by the minute interval that elapses

between the arrival of the galvanic current in the coils at a and the dipping

of the poles/, /into the mercury-cups. With the same battery power at E

and conducting wires, this delai/ is practically constant. Its amount, how-

ever, required to be determined, and the time, when converted into distance,

added to the gross transit-rate previously ascertained.

For this purpose the following little apparatus was employed. Its prin-

ciple, though not the precise details of its construction, is shown in

fig. 6, PI. IV. Upon a vertical steel spindle (s) revolving upon an agate step

at bottom, and in a polished brass collar at top, a cylindric barrel is placed,

of 1 inch diameter, having an escapement-wheel and anchor-escapement (i>)

at its lower end, all the parts being made as light as possible. Upon the

upper end of the spindle a circular disk of Bristol board (cardboard),/ of

12f inches diameter, is secured by a light screw collar (t) gripping the disk
firmly, so that it and the spindle must revolve together. Both the upper and

under surfaces of the card-disk, for an inch or two from the circumference,

towards the centre, were slightly rubbed with violin-player's hard rosin, and

the whole, resting upon its base B, placed so that the disk should rotate

Ahorizontally.  fine elastic silk thread is wound a few turns round the

barrel, and passing over the sheave (r) sustains a weight (W), by the descent

of which, when required, rotation can be given to the disk, &c., the weight

itself being large in proportion to the inertia of the rotating parts. By suit-

able changes in the disposition of the parts of the contact-maker (chiefly in

getting the cast-iron arm d, fig. 2, out of the way), it was placed at C with

respect to the disk ; so that the lower poles of the electro-magnets (a, a) were

just above the upper surface of the card-disk, and the short end of the lever

armature (e) just below the same, the card running free in the small space

between, and the centre of the magnet-poles being exactly at a radius of

6 inches from the centx-e of the disk. Nearly at right angles on the disk to

this, the chronograph (D) was placed and firmly fixed : a fixed point (shown

in part only in the fig. g), formed of a bit of cylindrical mahogany, with its
lower end rosined, was so fixed as to be about y^th of an inch above the

upper surface of the disk. The lever (m) of the chronograph, divested of its

forked pole, and having a small rectangular rod of brass substituted, was so

adjusted that its sustaining spring beneath should press this brass terminal up

against the under surface of the disk atp, directly below the fixed point or

stop (ff), and bending the cardboard there, press its ujjper surface into con-

Wtact with the lower end of ^.
   Thus the weight being free to descend, this arrangement atj9 acted as

a detent to keep the disk from moving ; but when the lever (w) was pressed
down to start the chronograph, the disk immediately became released, and

began to revolve by the action of the weight W. At E the contact-making

battery, or one of equal power, was placed, one of its poles being connected,
       ON THE TRANSIT-VELOCITY OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES. 213

through the rheostat (R), by conducting wires with the coil of the electro-

magnet (a), and terminating at the e+ pole at the mercury-cup (n), which
was in connexion with the other or e-- pole of the batterj'.

   The rheostat was adjusted so tiiat the resistance equalled that of the

Econducting wires along the telegraphic poles between C and D, (fig. 1,

PI. IV.). In this state of things, when the lever (m) of the chronograph
was pressed down, the disk (f) instantly commenced rotating; but directly
afterwards the electro-magnet (a), whose current was established by the first
movement, attracted the lever armature (e) through the disk, and the latter
was arrested by being gripped between the pole of the magnet and the
armature. The arc of the circumference of the disk then, at the centre
of the magnec-pole (i.e. with 6 inches radius), that was intercepted between
the marked spot (p) whence it started and that at which it was arrested,
became a measure of the time lost or elapsed between starting the chrono-
graph at the observer's station and making contact at the firing-battery in

the actual experiments.

   The arc thus intercepted was converted into time, from the descent of the

                                            jj

weight (W), by the common formula l=2L-, s being given and equal to yVth

                                                                   4

the length in feet of the arc described by the circumference of the disk before
being ari'ested ; and this was capable of being controlled by measuring by the
chronograph itself the actual time of a given number of successive revolu-

tions, and parts of revolutions, of the disk. The total number of complete
revolutions made being taken by reckoning the coils wound off the barrel
upon a mean of ten experiments with this apparatus, the delay at the contact-
maker appeared to be no more than 0"'0l43, which converted into distance,

at the greatest transit-rate observed, gives a correction of 17'3 feet per second,
and at that of the least of 12*S feet per second, both additive.

   It may be remarked that the small error due to inei'tia, &c. in this apparatus

tends nearly to correct itself, the extremely small time lost at starting of the

disk being very nearly equalled by its tendency to be carried a little too
far by the velocity impressed. The whole inertia also of the disk, barrel, Sic.

was extremely small in proportion to the moving weight W.

   Another correction requiring to be attended to in these experiments was
the time of hung-Jire in the charge of the mine, that is to say, the time
required for the burning of such a portion of the whole charge of powder
as should be sufficient to rupture the rock around, and so start off from

--the focus the Avave-impulse perceived in the seismoscope in other words,

the time lost between the instant of first ignition of the powder, viewed
as simultaneous with that of making contact at the firing-battery B, and
the starting of the wave of impulse to be measured.

   In my ibrmer experiments at Killiney Bay, it will be recollected that it
was in my power to determine this experimentally and rigidly, the moderate

charges of powder there employed admitting of this, and that I found it
amount for 25 lbs. of powder to 0""050513, or to about ^-^\\x of a second.
Such is, in fact, the time that the full charge of a 68-pounder takes to burn.
But in the present case direct experiment was impossible, and the value for
this correction can only be approximately obtained by observing the time that
elapsed in some instances between the moment of making contact at B, and
the first great visible movement of rock at the iace of the heading. This
observation I made in three instances, noting the time by a delicately made

chronoscope, by M. Robert, Rue du Coq, Paris. The results gave 0"'05,

0"'04', and 0"-8 for the time of hang-fire respectively, noting from the first
visible movement of rock at the face of the heading. This would give a mear
                          --

214 REPORT 1861.

of 0"'0566, or very nearly 0"-06 for the time of hang-fire, which can be
viewed, however, only as an approximation. It must vary slightly with
every diflPerent " heading," depending as it does upon a great variety of con-

ditions, but probably much more upon the exact proportion subsisting in any

given case between the actual resistance of the rock to the powder employed,
than upon the absolute quantity of the latter, although the total mass of
powder burnt is also an element. The greatest observed difference between
the greatest and least hang-fire amounted to 0"*03, which, converted into
distance at the mean transit-rate of our experiments, would give a. possible

maximum error due to this cause of about 31 feet per second. The probable

error cannot be more than about one-half that amount. This correction,

converted into distance, is also additive.

   By the methods thus described the experiments were commenced and

conducted up to the middle of 1857; great trouble and difficulty, however,
were experienced from the outset in keeping the arrangements in working
order, and so as to be efficient when wanted at the very brief notice that

could be afforded me beforehand by the officers in charge of the works,
when suitable headings were about to be fixed. The entire line of telegraph

wires, the observer's shed, &c., were exposed to mischief and depredation,
and to injury in that tempestuous place by storms, &c. The long intervals
between the experiments involved preparations and adjustment of every part
of the galvanic apparatus afresh upon each occasion ; and for the most trifling

repairs workmen had to be brought from Conway, or even from Manchester,
as also, in every case, to make good the branch-conductors from the tele-
graph wires. The length of the range and hilly character of the ground
also produced much difficulty in being assured that all was right from end
to end against the moment at which the firing was obligatory, as well as
great personal fatigue at a moment when composed ease and freedom from
fatigue were most desirable for good observation.

   These difficulties, in great part foreseen, had early caused me to turn
my attention to the practicability of so adjusting at the observing-station a

telescope of large field and clear definition, and so disposing the Grove's
firing-battery and other apparatus at the quarry clifi", that all could be clearly
seen from the former point, and the act of making contact at the firing-
battery observed by myself with distinctness and certainty, the two extre-
mities of the range being thus, as it were, visually brought together.

   Two attempts to experiment in the summer and autumn of 1857, ren-
dered abortive by derangements of the galvanic apparatus, caused me finally

to abandon it, though unwillingly. I found, however, with some satisfaction,

that, subject to the possible fatality of a cloud settling over the quarry clifi',
and so shutting it out from sight just at the critical moment, the telescopic
arrangement, on trial, really seemed to offer quite as accurate results as the

more complex method, and more difficult to manage, of galvanic contact-
making ; and the new mode was thus continued to the end of the experiments.
The firing-battery being so disposed upon the sloping brow of the quarry cliff

facing my station as to be clearly visible to me, as well as every movement

of those employed there, a code of signals was arranged between myself

and Mr. Cousens, by which we should mutually become cognizant of the
state of preparation, &c., and successive acts at our respective stations. When
all was ready at both ends for the explosion, the final signal was made by
INIr. Cousens, by elevating a bright red flag (mounted upon a short and

light staff') to a vertical position, the lower end resting on a fixed point; a

prearranged interval of a few seconds (usually 10") intervened, when he
dropped the red flag, rotating it upon the loAver end of the staff held in the
ON THE TRANSIT-VELOCITY OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES. 215

right hand, and with the left made contact of the poles of the firing-battery

at the same instant that the flag reached the horizontal position. Standing

facing me, and as distinctly observable by me upon each occasion as though

I had been close beside him, my own eye and attention were directed to

Mr. Cousens's left hand ; at the instant that I observed the contact made by
him, I released my chronograph, and at once transferred my eye from the
Aeyepiece of the observing-telescope to that of the seismoscope.
                                                                  moment

elapsed before my own eye adjusted itself to the focus of the latter; but the

length of transit-period of the wave (always above 4") gave ample time for

this, and then at the disappearance of the cross wires, as in the former case, I

arrested the chronograph. The only source of time-error introduced by this

plan was that of the probability of some slight inequality of speed in dipping

the poles to make contact on Mr. Cousens's part (which may be called

his personal equation), and the introduction of a somewhat larger value

than before to my own personal equation--in the former arrangement that
being due to consent between my hand and observation by the eye of

one object, in the latter between the hand and observation of tivo objects.
As regards the first, several experiments were made by Mr. Cousens and
myself at the firing-station, by his repeatedly lowering the red flag and making
(the movement of) contact, the contact-maker (fig.2, Pl.IV.) and chronograph

being so arraiiged as to register the total interval of time in each case

between the first visible motion of the red flag and the completion of

contact; others were so made as to register the time between the hori-
zontal position of the red flag and the completion of contact. The result
gave a minimum error of 0"-009, and a maximum of 0"-017. The mean

error, 0"-013, is thus almost equal to the constant due to the contact-

maker (in previous arrangement), with this difference, however, that the

+ --error in the present case might be either or . In twelve experiments

nine were -f, or additive ; that is to say, the contact was made more slowly
with the left hand than the flag was dropped with the right. The probability
is therefore 3 : 1 that the error would be always additive, and would not

exceed 0"-013, even if my observation was wholly directed to the flag; but
as I directed my attention as completely as possible only to the movement

of the contact-making hand, it is still less, and therefore, as not amounting

to more than 6 or 7 feet per second in transit-time, may be neglected alto-
gether. As regards my own personal equation of observation, it will be seen,
on reference to "Second Report," &c. (British Association Report, 1851,

p. 305, &c.), of the former experiments at Killiney, where it was ascertained

for both observers that its amount is much too minute to enter sensibly

into the present results ; and it is needless to say that this is a fortiori the

case as respects the time lost in transmission of the galvanic current through

the. 12,000 or 13,000 feet of conducting wire.

   The diagrams (Plate III.) give, to one scale, horizontal sections of the
several headings from the experiments on which transit-results have been

deduced, and a vertical section also of No. 31, quarry No. 9, as illustrative in
this respect of all the others. The line of heading, from the face of the cliff up

to any focus of charge, turns, it will be seen, thrice at right angles to itself,
the object being more effectually to confine the effort of the powder when
fired, and prevent the mass of " tamping " from being blown out. Results
have been deduced from two headings, each of single focus, two of double

--focus, one of triple focus, and one of four foci, the face of the cliff blown

out varying, as marked in each case in the figure, from 60 feet to 120 feet
in height, and the total weight of powder fired at one time being from 2100

lbs. up to the enprmous charge of 12,000 lbs., or nearly 6 tons.
--216 REPORT 1861.

It was necessary to ascertain the exact distance in a right line from each of

these headings, wherever situated, to the observing-station O, at Pen-y-Brin ;
and for tliis purpose, previously to each explosion, the distance of the mouth

Wof the heading was measured with accuracy (which the ground admitted
of) from the ilagstaff at  (see Map, Plate II., and Section 1, Plate III.),

the exact distance of the latter having been previously determined from the

observing-station O, as already described.

The angle of azimuth made at the flagstaff by the line of constant range

(O W), and by the line joining the flagstaff and mouth of the heading, was

observed in each case, and we thus had the requisite data, from which was

calculated, by the usual formulge,

                              i(A + B)=90°-iC,
     log tan I- (A-B)=log +(a-^^) log tan | (A + B)-- log (A + B),

C being the observed angle, a and b the known sides from flagstaff to O,

and from flagstaff to the mouth of the heading.
   Thus the actual range of wave-transit from the focus of each explosion

Oto the seismoscope at was finally obtained. The positions respectively

of each are marked by a black dot, and numbered in order of the date of

experiment upon the Map (Plate II.), taken from Mr. Rendel's chart of 1850,
published by the Admiralty. Upon it the measured base (A B), and tri-

angulation for obtaining the constant range (O W), and for checking that
measurement, are marked. The actual wave-paths are therefore in right
lines from the dots No. I, No. 2, No. 3, &c., to the point O. The coast-line
and position approximately of the cliff- faces of the quarries, and the superficial
line of junction of the quartz-rock and of the slate, are also marked. The

great clay dyke passing through the quartz rock at the quain'ies in rear of
the headings is marked by a pair of interrupted lines.

   The Map is to a scale of I| inch to 1000 feet, but is not quite exact as

to filling in details on land ; the important distances here concerned are
therefore marked in by figures.

    In the opposite Table (p. 217) our chief numerical results are comprised
at one view.

   The first result that strikes the eye at once in regarding the Table (p. 217)
is, that, with the exception of the experiment No. 1, all show that the transit-

--rate tends to increase in velocity with the increased quantity of powder

fired, in other words, that the loss of velocity in the same rock is less, in
some proportion, as the force of the originating impulse of the wave is greater,
and its amplitude greater therefore on starting.

    This is apparent if the uncorrected transit-rates (col. 8) be arranged
in the order of increased weights of powder exploded, thus :

--218 REPORT 1861.

Nor is it due to relative differences of different experiments in the lengths

of range, in the quartz rock and in the slate respectively, as might be

imagined ; for the experiments Nos. 2, 5, and 6 had wave-paths of about
1400 feet in quartz only, and embrace the lowest and the highest velocities,

while Nos. 1, 3, and 4 had about double this range or wave-path in quartz,

with velocities not widely different from each other, or from No. 2.

There are four corrections altogether applicable to the uncorrected transit-

rates, col. 8, Table I., as already referred to, viz.

    1st. That for the liquid wave in the seismoscope, which, as a delay in

+time, is, when converted into distance, always . This correction has

been already applied in cols. 9 and 10, Table I.

     2ndly. That for the time of hang-fire of each explosion in the rock, the

constant in time for which has been given, =0"'056.

It appeared, however, uncertain whether this should be converted into di-

stance, as probably nearly constant for every experiment, or in what way

it might be variable, in relation to the weight of powder, and other circum-

stances of each. The result disclosed in Table II., however, appears to

indicate that the conversion into distance should be proportionate to the

respective gross or uncorrected transit-rates, assuming, as we may now do,

that these are functions of the originating impulses and resistances together,

in each instance. This may not be absolutely true, but is the nearest ap-

+proximation we can make. This correction in distance is also always

ON THE TRANSIT-VELOCITY OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES. 219

The general mean derivable from the whole of the experiments taken to-

gether gives IITS'^O? feet per second for the transit-rate. The results, how-

ever, obviously form two groups, viz. Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 6 from the smaller

charges of powder, and Nos. 4 and 5 from the greater ones.

The mean from the four first is 1088*5597 feet per second, and that from

the two last is 1352*1015 feet per second ; and taking a mean of means from
both of these, we obtain a final result of 1220*3306 feet per second as the

mean transit-velocity of propagation, in the rocks experimented on, of a

wave-pulse produced by the impulse of a charge not exceeding 12,000 lbs.

Weof powder.  may be justified in concluding that the velocity of wave-pro-

pagation (or transit) really does increase with the force of the original im-

pulse ; it would be vain, however, to attempt to deduce the law of such
increase from the results before us.

The experiments of Mr. Goldingham at Madras, on the retardation of

sound in moist air, and the theoretical researches of Mr. Earnshaw, both, by

analogy, rendered a priori probable what is now for the first time, so far
as I am aware, experimentally shown.

It follows, then, on reference to my former experiments at Killiney Bay,

that the rate of wave-propagation in highly stratified, contorted, and foliated

rock is intermediate between that for dense wet sand and for discontinuous

and shattered granite. Adopting the first mean from the smaller charges of

powder, as better comparable with the Killiney experiments, which were

made with charges of only 25 lbs. of powder, and which would doubtless have

been higher velocities with heavier charges, we obtain the following series :

In more solid granite     1664*574                          ,,,,

  We may infer, even adopting the highest mean of these experiments

(1 352*101 feet per second) for comparison with the transit-rate for discon-
tinuous granite, and bearing in mind that the former velocity is due to the im-

pulse originated by a mean charge of 9100 lbs. of powder, while the latter was
due to one of but 25 lbs., that for equal originating impulses the rate of propaga-
tion of waves analogous to earthquake-waves of shock must be less generally,

if not always, in contorted stratified rocks than in crystalline igneous rocks

analogous to granite, the amount of shattered discontinuity being the same

in both.

   The general mean obtained, viz. 1220*33 feet per second= 13*877 statute
English miles per minute, coordinates, as might be expected, with the more

trustworthy of the older attempts to determine the velocity of propagation
of earth quake- waves in nature (see Table 8, " Second Report on Earth-

quakes," &c., Report of Brit. Assoc. 1851, p. 316), and still more so with the
more recent and exact determinations of such velocities made by Noggerath*,

Mincow in Hungary, and by myself in the (late) Neapolitan kingdom, after

the great shock of 1857, Mhere I found that the velocity of propagation iu
the shattered limestone and argillaceous rocks of the shaken region was even
below what has been here determined for the harder and more compact rocks
of Wales, also of stratified structure. Experiment and observation have

thus alike sustained the three provisional conclusions anticipated by me as

to the transit-velocities of earthquake-waves in nature (at the conclusion of

"Second Report," &c., Report of Brit. Assoc. 1851, p. 316), in passing

through formations different in character.
    In experimenting with these great explosions at Holyhead, I have been

enabled to see that such great impulses, though offering the advantages of a
greatly extended range, and hence larger total time-period for measurement,
do not in reality admit, from various contingent circumstances, of greater, or

perhaps of as great accuracy of transit determinations, as do much smaller

explosions, such as those specially madeatKilliney Bay. These great explo-
sions, however, elicit phenomena visible in the seismoscope, which are too
faint to be distinct when due to smaller charges, and which analogize closely
with the succession of vibratory and wave movements observed in natural
earthquakes. In the larger of these great explosions, as the impulsive wave
approached the instrument, the previously steady reflected image of the cross
wires did not at once disappear ; the definition of the wires rapidly became
obscured, the obscuration increasing fur an instant to a flickering of the

image, preceding its obliteration, at the same moment that the oscillation
then communicated to the trough caused the mercury to sway from end to

end, in a liquid wave, whose amplitude was sufficient to cause variable flashes
of light to be transmitted to the eye, with the changing inclination of the

--reflecting-surface of the undulating mirror, the image of the cross Avires

reappearing (but now oscillating with the movement impressed upon the

mercury in the direction of the wave-transit) by passing through a second
phase of flickering and vibration, but in the reverse order, before becoming
perfect in definition as at the commencement.

   I had thus presented visibly before me the " tremors " that nearly invari-

ably are described as preceding and following the main shock and destructive
surface movement in every great earthquake. The phenomena appear to be

identical, however premature it may be to propose a precise and adequate

explanation of their production.

    There appear to be three elements upon which the wave-transmissive
power of a rock-formation mainly depends, viz. the modulus of elasticity of
its material, the absolute range of its compression by a given impulse or im-
pact, and the degree of heterogeneity and discontinuity of its parts. As has
been already described, the range of wave-transit of these experiments
passed through two rock-formations, quartz and slate, differing in name
and in several respects in structure, yet very much alike, as has been re-
marked, in intimate composition. It remains to show experimentally that
they do not differ in these conditions of transmissive power to such an extent

as materially to affect the results.

    If a perfectly elastic ball be dropped upon a mass of perfectly elastic rock,

whose volume may be considered as infinite with respect to that of the ball,

the latter will rebound to the height from which it descended ; and if the
same ball, though not perfectly elastic, be dropped in succession upon like
masses of two different rocks, it will rebound from each to a height less than
 that from which it fell, and the value of which will depend mainly upon the
elasticity, the depth of the impression, and tlie degree of discontinuity of the

     ON THE TRANSIT-VELOCITY OP EARTHaUAKE WAVES. 221

Werocks respectlvelj%    have therefore thus got the means of very simply

determining, in a sufficiently approximate manner, the relation between the

velocity of impact and that of recoil, a quantity that bears the most intimate

relation to the wave-transmissive power of rocks or other like bodies. To

conduct this experiment I dropped an ordinary ivory billiard ball upon a

number of different masses of the quartz-rock, and also of the slate, both

in situ, and upon very large isolated blocks, making the impacts both

transverse to the stratifications and foliation and in the same planes as these,

in both sorts of rock. The ball was dropped from a constant height of

5 feet above the point of impact, and beside a graduated scale held vertically
by an assistant, by means of which, after a little practice, and skill in
choosing by trial a point of impact, from which the ball shall rebound
vertically only, it is easy to observe with considerable accuracy the height
to which it recoils, the eye being gradually brought to the same level as that
to which the ball rises, so as to read the scale free from parallax.

  HIf and h be the height from which the ball has fallen and that to which

it rebounds, then

                         ^^^^^ = -=R,

which may be viewed as a symbol of the above relation, and closely con-

nected with the wave-retardation respectively. In the quartz-rock I obtained

the following results :

   From the hardest and densest blocks or masses, and edgeways to the lami-

nation, the ball recoiled 2"33 feet; v is therefore =sVJi=12-25l feet per

second.

   From the softer and more earthy masses, and transverse to the planes of

lamination, the recoil was 1*50 feet, and 2;=9"822 feet per second.

   And in the slate-rock,
   From the hardest and densest, edgeways to the foliation, the ball recoiled
2*00 feet, or V=11'341 feet per second.
   From the least hard and dense, and transverse to the planes of foliation,

the recoil was 1'417 feet, and 2;=9'546 feet per second.
   The mean value for the quartz rock is thus

numbers which differ so slightly from equality as to indicate that there is
no great difference of transmissive power in the two rocks. Indeed this is
rendered certain by consideration of the experiments themselves. Previously
to their commencement I expected that in every instance the range in quartz

would have been extremely short in relation to that in slate, and very nearly
the same in all cases. The circumstances of the works subsequently obliged

me to increase the range in the quartz, and to adopt " headings " for experi-

ment, three of which have a range in quartz of nearly double that of the
other three, as seen in the two following Tables :

    In each of the two groups everything is as nearly as possible alike ; there
are two explosions of moderate charges and one great explosion in each.
They differ only in this, that in the first group (Table IV.) the range in
quartz, in proportion to that in slate, is very nearly double that in the latter
(Table V.), being in the ratio of 2-66 : 1-32; yet, as will be observed,
the mean transit-rate in both groups is almost alike, being in the ratio of
1058-27 : 1015 : 75. This would be obviously impossible if either one rock
or the other exercised any well-marked accelerating or retarding influence
upon the transmission of the wave.

    In their direct relation to seismology the interest of the foregoing results

is not as great as when some years since I commenced these experiments.
At that period no knowledge whatever existed as to the relation that subsists

in nature between the velocity of transit and the velocity of the particles in
wave-movement in actual earthquakes. Geological observers, in fact, did

not appear to be aware of any such physical distinction ; and those who were
so, presumed that the velocity of the particles M^as like that of transit, ex-
tremely great, and that some simple relation would probably be found

between them.

   The first determinations of velocity of the particles in wave-movement that
have ever been made, namely, those by myself of the great Neapolitan earth-
quake of 1857, have dissipated this notion, however, and proved that the

velocity of the particles in even the greatest shocks is extremely small, not
exceeding 20 feet per second in very great earthquakes, and probably never
having reached SO feet per second in any shock that has occurred in history.
                                                                        --

ON THE TRANS IT-VELOCITY OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES. 223

No simple relation appears as yet between the transit-velocity and that of the

particles ; and however interes'ting and important both to general physics and

to seismology may be further determinations with exactness of the former,

it is to the observation and measurement of the latter, by the methods pointed
out in the Report upon the Neapolitan Earthquake*, and there employed,

that we must look as instruments of future seismological research.
   I proceed to lay before the Association the results of some experiments

upon the modulus of elasticity of perfectly solid portions of both these
rocks, with a view to the interesting question of the relation between the
theoretic velocity of transmission, if the rock were all solid and homo-

(y=geneous  ^2q -, e being that modulusY and the actual velocity found

by the preceding experiments.

   Subsequently to the conclusion of the experiments at Holyhead, referred

to above, I have been enabled to complete a series of experiments upon the

compressibility of the rocks which formed my range there, and have de-

termined their moduli of elasticity, &c. The inferences derivable from this

latter series form the proper sequel to what has preceded, and they throw

some new and not unimportant light upon several points of earthquake

dynamics. The experiments were made upon cubes cut from solid and

--perfect pieces of the rocks by the lapidary's wheel, each 0-707 inch upon

the edge each side, therefore, presenting a surface of 0-5 square inch;

and the utmost care was taken to preserve perfect parallelism between the

opposite boundary planes, so that, when compressed between hardened steel

surfaces, fracture should not result by mere inequality of pressure.

The experiments were made at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, with the

very accurate and  excellent  machine  used  for  testing  compression  and ex-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           :

tension of metals in the gun-factory ; and I have to express my thanks to

Lieut.-Col. Anderson, C.E., the Superintendent of that department, for the

valuable assistance afforded me through his attention. The specimens ope-

rated on consisted of two each from the following four classes, namely

   The hardest and the softest slate-rock, and the hardest and the softest quartz-

rock, which occur within the range or neighbourhood of my experimental

explosions at Holyhead ; and from each of these classes or varieties of the

two rocks, cubic specimens were compressed, 1st, in a direction transverse

to the plane of lamination, 2nd, parallel to the same, all the cubes being so

cut out of the rock that two sides were, guam prox., parallel to the plane of

natural lamination or jointing. The load (50 lbs.) first applied was consi-

dered zero, being only sufficient to ensure a complete bearing in all parts

of the instrument. The subsequent loads advanced by 1000 lbs. at a time,

up to the crushing of the specimen ; and at each fresh load the amount of

compression was measured by beam-callipers, with instrumental arrange-

ments that admitted of reading space to -0005 of an inch.

The experimental results, as obtained, are recorded in the following

Tables, from No. 1 to No. 8 inclusive ; and in the succeeding Tables 9

and 10, the results of the former are compared, and the mean compression

deduced for each 1000 lbs. of pressure applied upon a prism of each of the

four classes of rock (two of slate and two of quartz), of one inch square

surface, and one inch in height, and under both conditions as to the relative

direction of pressure and of lamination.

particles more or less wedge-shaped and flat, and angular fragments more or

less crystalline, deposited together, witii their larger dimensions in the planes
of lamination, which lamination has been produced by enormous compression

in a direction transverse to its planes. Hence the mass of these rocks has
already been subjected to enormous compression in the same direction as that
in which we now find their further compressiliility the least. But, besides
that we might from this cause alone anticipate a higher compressibility when
the pressure is applied to them parallel to the lamination, anotlier condition
comes into play : their aggregation of flat, wedge-shaped particles, when thus
pressed edgeways, tends powerfully to their mutual lateral expansion, and
hence to their giving way in the line of pressure.

   The per-saltum way in which all the specimens of both rocks yield,
in whatever direction pressed, is another noteworthy circumstance. On
examining the Tables I. to VIII., it will be seen that the compressions do

not constantly advance with the pressure, but that, on the contrary, the rock
occasionally suffers almost no sensible compression for several successive
increments of pressure, and then gives way all at once (though without
having lost cohesion, or having its elasticity permanently impaired) and com-
presses thence more or less for three or four or more successive increments
of pressure, and then holds fast again, and so on. This phenomenon is pro-
bably due to the mass of the rock being made up of intermixed particles of
several different simple minerals, each having specific diff'erences of hardness,
cohesion, and mutual adhesion, and which are, in the order of their resist-
ances to pressure, in succession broken down, before the final disruption of the
whole mass (weakened by these minute internal dislocations) takes place.

   Thus it would appear that the micaceous plates and aluminous clay-
particles interspersed through the mass give way first. The chlorite in the
slate, and probably felspar-crystals in the quartz-rock, next, and so on in
order, until finally the elastic skeleton of silex gives way, and the rock is

crushed. It is observable, also, that this successive disintegration does not

occur at equal pressures, in the same quality and kind of rock, when com-
pressed transverse and parallel to the lamination. It follows from this con-
stitution of these (and probably of all) rocks that very diff'erent powers of
transmitting wave-impulses must arise when the originating forces vary
considerably in amount produced of primary compression. It is almost
superfluous also to point out the great difterences in wave-transmissive power
in directions transverse and parallel to lamination that these experiments dis-
close. They prove to us that, in an earthquake shock of given original power,
the vibrations will have the largest amplitude when transmitted in the line of
lamination, but may be propagated with the greatest velocity in directions
transverse to the same, assuming in both cases the Tock solid and unshattered.

   In Table XII. the general results are deduced, and the mean compressions
for each of the rocks calculated, and finally the moduli of elasticity are
obtained, in pounds and in feet ; the specific gravities adopted in calculating
the latter being those given in the body of the paper, as follows :

elastic limit of the rock is passed, and that at which it is finally crushed,
together with the modulus of cohesion or resistance to compression, are also
given, and will be useful to the engineer and architect. In the last column,

the value of my own modification of Poncelet's coetficient T, (la force vive

de rupture) is calculated in foot pounds, and represents the relative work

done at fracture in eacli case.

   To apply the results thus obtained to those of experimental wave-trans-

mission at Holyhead.
    Poisson has shown (Traite de Mecanique, vol. ii. p. 319) that the velocity

of wave-transmission (sound) in longitudinal vibrations of elastic prisms is

LSo that being the modulus of elasticity of the solid, expressed in feet, the

velocity of wave-transmission through it, if absolutely homogeneous and

unbroken, is

Where, owing to want of homogeneity, or to shattering, or other such con-

Vdition, as found in natural rock, the experimental value of difiTers from

the above theoretic one, we may still express the former by the same

general form of equation

in which the coefficient a. expresses the ratio to g that the actual or experi-
mental bears to the theoretic (or maximum possible) velocity of wave-trans-

mission.

   In the slate- and quartz-rocks of Holyhead, I ascertained the mean lowest

velocity of wave-transmission (for small explosions or impulses) to be 1089

feet per second (omitting decimals), the mean highest velocity 1352 feet
per second, and the general mtan velocity from all, 1220 feet per second.

   Applying Eq. IV. to these numbers, and adopting the values of L given

in Table XII. (mean of Nos. 9 and 10), we obtain

                       --Va=: =;

and for the three preceding velocities, a has the following values :

   The actual velocity of wave-transmission in the slate and quartz together,
therefore, was to the theoretic velocity due to the solid material as

        a : ^^2^ or 0-714 : 5-674, or 1-00 : 7-946.

From which it results, that nearly seven-eigJiths of the full velocity of wave-
transmission due to the material is lost bj^ reason of the heterogeneity and

discontinuity or shattering of the rocky mass, as it is found piled together

in nature.

   This loss would be proportionately larger with still smaller originating

impulses, and vice versa, but in what proportion we are not at present in a

position to know.

   If we may (or a moment allude to final causes, we cannot but be struck

with this beneficent result (amongst others) arising from the shattered and
broken-up condition of all the rocky masses forming the habitable surface of
our globe, viz. that the otherwise enormous transit-velocity of the wave-form
in earthquake shocks is by this simple means so reduced.

    That this retardation is mainly effected by the multiplied subdivisions of
the rock, and in a very minor degree by differences in the elastic moduli of
rock of diff'erent species, is apparent on examining the Tables IV. and V. of
the previous part of this Report referring to the experiments at Holyhead.

    Although, therefore, we are now enabled, from what precedes, to calcu-

late values for a, for the slate rocks and for the quartz of Holyhead, sepa-

rately, and thus obtain separate values for V, for each of those rocks ; the
result would probably be more or less delusive, as we have no possible
means of deciding what is the relative amount of shattering and disconti-
nuity for equal horizontal distances, in each of these two rocks ; nor what

the relative retarding powers, of planes of separation running in variable
directions, and at all possible angles, across the line of wave-transit, as
 compared with their retarding powers, if either all transverse to, or all in the
 same direction as, the wave-path.

    The greatest possible mean velocity of wave-propagation, in rock as per-
fectly solid and unsJiattered as our experimental cubes, is determinable for

 both slate and quartz in the two directions of transmission, viz. transverse to

Land in the line of lamination, from Eq. III., and the mean values of in

 Nos. 9 and 10, and 11 and 12, Table XII., as follows:

both in round numbers; or the transverse is to the parallel transit-rate

nearly as 1-8 : 1-0.

This great difference of velocity, due to the diff"ercnce in the molecular

properties of the material of the rocks in their opposite directions, is, as our

Holyhead experiments prove, almost wholly obliterated by the vastly in-
                    --  --

--234 REPORT 1861.

creased degree of discontinuity and shattering, in the directions approaching
 that of lamination, or transverse to the wave-path in the first case.

    It is necessary to guard against any misconception as to the import of this

result. The fact ascertained and just enunciated is this, that the velocity of

wave-transmission is greater in the material of these rocks in a direction
across their lamination than in one longitudinal to the same, provided or

--assuming the material he perfectly unshuttered in both as homogeneous, in

fact, as the small specimen-cubes experimented upon. And were the whole

mass of the rock, as it lies in the mountain-bed, as homogeneous as such
cubes, then the velocity of wave-transmission would actually be greater
across long ranges of natural lamination, than edgeways to them. The oppo-
site, however, is often the case ; the wave-transit period is slower as the
range of rocky mass is more shattered, discontinuous and dislocated.

    These conditions most affect rocks in nature in or about their planes of
bedding, lamination, &c., and hence most retard wave-impulses transverse
to these planes ; so that the more rapid ivave-transmissive power of the

material of the rock in a directum transverse to the lamination may be more

than counterbalanced by the discontinuity of its mass transverse to the same

direction.

   The results of Wertheim, on the transmission of sound in timber,

proved the velocity to be greatest in a direction longitudinal to the fibres
and annual layers of wood ; less in a direction perpendicular to the same,
and radially outwards from the centre of the tree towards its exterior; and
least of all in a direction, qicam prox., parallel to the annual rings, and per-

pendicular to the longitudinal fibres ; that is to say, in eac!) case the velocity

of sound was rapid in proportion to the less compressibility of the wood in
the same direction. His results might seem at first to conflict with those
which I have announced. Any such conclusion, however, would be a mistake;

on the contrary, my results perfectly analogize with those above alluded to.

The difference between the cases is, that wood in mass, however large, is
practically homogeneous and unshattered, and that its direction of least

compressibility is longitudinal to its lamin(B (or annual layers) ; whereas the
direction of least compressibility of rock is transverse to its lamince which
have been already powerfully compressed in this direction. In fact, as
respects the question here in point, there is no true analogy in structure
between the lamination (by annual rings) of wood, and the lamination or

bedding of rock.
   It follows from what precedes, that earthquakes and rocks, as both ac-

--tually occur in nature, the rocks being of a stratified or laminated form
--(generally all sedimentary rocks), must present the following conditions as

to rate of transit of shock :
    1st. If such rocks were perfectly unshattered, and the beds or laminae in

absolute contact, the shock would be transmitted more rapidly across these
than in their own direction.

   The difference is more in favour of the transverse line, in proportion as
the rock is made up more of angular sedimentary particles of very unequal
dimensions, the longest being parallel to the general lamination, and in

proportion as the imbedding paste is softer in relation to such particles.

   Some sedimentary rocks no doubt exist, made up of particles perfectly

uniform and equal in all three dimensions, and without imbedding paste
such as the lithographic stones of Germany, the Apeunine marl-beds, &c.,

in which (assuming the above condition as to continuity) the transit-period

would be alike in all directions probably.

   2nd. The actual amount of shattering and discontinuity in nature being

usually greatest, upon the whole, in planes parallel to bedding or lamination,
the transit-rate of shock is most generally fastest in the line of the beds or
lamination, rather than across them.

   Or, at least, this latter condition may interfere with the former to the extent
of partial, complete, or more than complete obliteration.

   I am not aware that any experiments have previously been made upon

the compressibility, &c., of the slate- and quartz-rocks of Holyhead ; and as
these rocks are being employed there upon a vast scale for submarine

building works, it may not be out of place to draw a few conclusions of a

character useful to the practical engineer from the data that have been ob-

tained. Some conclusions may be drawn which are applicable to all classes

of laminated rocks in the hands of the engineer.
    It is a very prevalent belief that slate-rock (for example), in the

form of the sawed rooting-slate of Anglesea or of Valentia (Ireland), will

bear a much greater compressive load when the pressure is in the direction

of the laniinge, than in one across them. This the preceding experiments

--Drove to be wholly a mistake one that has very probably arisen from some

vague notion of an analogy with timber compressed the end-way of the

grain.

   It is now certain that Silurian slates and quartz-rock, and probably all
sedimentary laminated rocks, whether with cleavage or not, are much weaker

to resist a crushing force edgeways to the lamina, than across the same, and

that the range of compressibility is much greater, for equal loads, in the

former direction.

   The facts now ascertained as to the great relative compressibility of lami-

nated rock in the direction of the laminae also points out the reason of the
great bearing power to sustain impulsive loads, which the toughest and
most cohesive examples of slate-rocks, such as the slates of Caernarvonshire,
present ; for there can be no grounds to doubt that the high compressibility
of rocks of this structure in the plane of the lamina is also accompanied
with a high coefficient of extensibility, although probably confined within

much narrower limits as to inceptive injury to perfect continuity.

   My experiments point out, that the Silurian slate of Holyhead (the mean

both of the hard and the soft) is crushed by a load across the lamina of
about 1250 tons per square foot, and that its molecular arrangement is per-
manently injured at a little more than 1000 tons per square foot.

   The quartz-rock (the mean of both hard and soft) is crushed by a load,
applied in the same manner, of 1630 tons per square foot, and its molecular
arrangement is permanently injured at less than 1000 tons per super foot.
The quartz-rock gives the highest measure of ultimate resistance, but it is
the less trustworthy material when loaded heavily.

    Neither of these sorts of rock, if loaded so as to be pressed in the direction
of the lamina, would sustain more than about 0*7 of the above loads at the

crushing-point and at that of permanent injury, respectively. From the

extreme inequality found within narrow limits in both rocks as quarried,
neither should be trusted for safe load in practice with more than about ^^i^th

of the mean load that impairs their molecular arrangement, as ascertained
from selected specimens, or (say) not to more than 50 tons per square foot
for passive or 25 tons per square foot for impulsive loads.

   The high relative compressibility of laminated rocks in the direction of
the lamina might probably be made advantageous use of, where they are
employed as a building material, for the construction of revetment or other

walls of batteries exposed to the stroke of cannon shot, by building the
work (under suitable arrangements to obviate splitting up) with the planes
236 REPORT-- 1861.

of the laminae in the direction of the line of fire, i. e. perpendicular to the
faces of the work; for on inspecting the last column in Table XII. which con-
tains the values of T, under the several conditions of rock and of compres-

sion, it is at once apparent how much greater is the " work done" in crushing

the slates and the quartz in their toughest and most compressible direction,
i. e. in the direction of the lamina. Twice as much tvork is, upon the average,
consumed in crushing the rock in this direction, that suffices to destroy
its cohesion in the one transverse to the lamina ; and the proportion in the

two, in the case of the softest quartz (Nos. 5 and 8), is as much as about ^/Je

to one.

   It would be unsuitable, however, to the present memoir to pursue further
here such practical deductions suggested by the results obtained experi-

mentally.

On the Explosions in British Coal-Mines during the year 1859. By
   Thomas Dobson, B.A., Head Master of the School Frigate " Con-
   way" Liverpool.

In my Report " On the Relation between Explosions in Coal-mines .and Re-

volving Storms," read at the Meeting of this Association, at Glasgow, in

1855, 1 have given my reasons for tliinking that the freedom of the atmo-

sphere of a mine from noxious gases, and the occasional abundant issue of
such gases into a mine, are in a great measure dependent upon certain con-
ditions of the pressure and temperature of the external atmosphere. This
dependence is, indeed, a consequence so direct and obvious of the first prin-

ciples of pneumatics, that we may speak with certainty of the ki7id of influ-

ence exerted by the atmosphere in restraining or augmenting the flow of in-
flammable gases into a mine ; and we have only to inquire whether this influ-
ence is ever exercised to such a degree as to charge a mine up to the point

of explosion.

    It is, I think, now generally admitted that a high atmospheric pressure

tends to check the issue of gases into the workings of amine, and that a low
pressure favours their copious efi"usion from the broken coal and deserted
goaves.

    It is also evident that a low temperature of the external air makes the
ventilation of a mine brisk and effective, while a high temperature of the air
above renders the ventilation sluggish, and causes the gases to accumulate

 below.
    I have compared the dates of all the fatal explosions in British coal-mines,

 as given in the Reports of the Government Inspectors of Mines, with the
 corresponding barographical and thennographical records for several years,
 and find that this comparison tends to confirm in a very striking manner the

conclusions arrived at in my Report of the year 1855.
    Were the Government Inspectors to give in their Reports the dates of all

 explosions of gases in mines, whether fatal or not, and also the dates of days
 when mines have been in a dangerous state from the abundance of gas, but
 explosion avoided, the evidence of atmospheric influence would soon be placed
 beyond doubt. Seeing that the great atmospheric disturbances with which

 we are here concerned generally extend nearly simultaneously over Britain
 and the adjacent countries of the Continent, I have been at some pains to

 obtain the dates of all the great explosions in the coal-mines of France and
 Belgium; but I was told at the Ecole des Mines, in Paris, that they had no

ON THE EXPLOSIONS IN BRITISH COAL-MINES.          237

such record, and a communication witli the director of the mines of Belgium
was also fruitless.

   The dates for the year 1859 of all the fatal explosions in the coal-fields of
England, Scotland, and Wales are marked in the meteorological diagram
(Plate v.), in which one day is represented by a horizontal space of one-
twentieth of an inch, and '20° Fahr. by a vertical height of one inch.

   For the meteorological data I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Milner,

the surgeon of Wakefield Prison, where the instruments are read every
six hours, night and day. The portion of the diagram for the months of
October and November, showing the state of the atmosphere during the
passage of the ' Royal Charter ' storm, has been compared with observations
made at Oxford, Kevv, Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, and the Bishop's-rock
Lighthouse, Scilly Isles ; and the general agreement fully warrants the selec-
tion of the Wakefield curves as a fair type of the state of our atmosphere
during the year 1 859-.

   The curve of mean temperature is from results in a paper by Mr. Glaisher

in the 'Transactions of the Royal Society ' for 1850.
    If there were no connexion whatever between the weather and the condi-

tions that favour an explosion in a coal-mine, it would be found that the 70
or 80 vertical lines that denote fatal explosions would be scattered, as if by
chance, over the whole diagram, without any apparent reference to the great
depressions in the barometric curve, or to the great and sudden rises in the
thermometric curve. But this is not the case in any of the years that I have

examined. On the contrary, it is found that the lines of explosion have a

very decided tendency to group themselves about the few great atmospheric
perturbations of each year ; and to leave a very conspicuous and highly sig-
nificant blank in spaces, of a whole month's duration occasionally, where the
pressure has been uniformly high and the temperature moderate.

    In the 68 explosions of 1859 are found three dense groups and a number

of equally instructive blanks.

   The first group falls between the 11th of January and the 17th of Febru-

ary, during which period the diagram shows that even the nocturnal tem-
perature was considerably above the mean daily temperature, and the baro-
metric curve exhibits a succession of deep indentations marking the passage
of a series of storms.

   The dates and localities of the explosions forming this group are :

January 11, Bewdley.         January 29, Aberdare, S. Wales.

12, Atherstone.              February 2, Dudley.

· 25, Stevenston, Scotland.  17, Wigan.

29, Burslem, Staffordshire.

Two cases of death from suffocation by gas fall within this group, viz.,

          --On February 1, at St. Helen's, and
                                 ' 18, at Tiviotdale, Rowley Regis.

  An interval of a fortnight follows, with a high atmospheric pressure, and

no fatal accidents in mines from gas.

   During March, and the first week of April, the temperature is far above
the mean, and two well-characterized cyclones send the mercury in the baro-
meter at Wakefield down to 28-83 on the 14th, and to 28-91 on the 28th.

   The second great group of 14 explosions falls in this interval ; 8 explosions

happening within 8 consecutive days-- exactly coinciding with one of the

A miner was suffocated by gas at Aberdare on the 3rd of March.

No more great groups occur until October; but there is scarcely a single

explosion tliat does not point to atmospheric influences, and in some cases in

a very unmistakeable manner, as those of the 27th and 28th June, after the

maximum thermometer had marked 81° F. and 80°'75 F. on the two pre-

ceding days, and the minimum thermometer showed 57'^"25 F. and58°-25 F.
and the two explosions on the 12th July, the maximum thermometer having
marked 85°'25 F. and 90° F., and the minimum thermometer 52°"25 F. and

67°"50 F. on the two preceding days. It will also be observed that there is

an entire absence of explosions from July 30 to August 31, a period of high

atmospheric pressure and mean temperature.

    In the beginning of October the temperature was unusually high, even the

minimum thermometer ranging above the mean for several days. On the
7th and 8th the reading of the minimum thermometer at Wakefield was 56°
F., and three fatal explosions happen on the latter day. On the ISth began
a remarkable atmospheric paroxysm which lasted until the 10th of Novem-

ber, and of which the ' Koyal Charter ' storm, on the 26th October, was
only a portion. During this interval there were lost by shipwreck on the

British coasts 877 lives and 77 vessels. On the very day that the ' Royal

Charter' steamship was lost in a violent storm, there occurred three fatal ex-
plosions, two in England and one in Scotland.

   The October group contains 14 explosions, to which may be added 4 cases

of death from suffocation by gas, of which the respective dates and localities

   It is instructive to compare this group of accidents in October, when the

atmospheric conditions were highly favourable to the presence of inflam-
mable gases in coal-mines, with the entire blank shown by the diagram in
August, when the atmospheric conditions were as decidedly of an opposite

tendency.

   The only fatal accidents from gas in mines during November and Decem-

Continuation of Report on Steam Navigation at Hull. By James
    Oldham, C.E., Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers.

In 1853, when I made niyfirist Report to the British Association on the rise
and progress of steam navigation at Hull, we had twenty-one sea-going and
twenty-three river steamers; now we have sixty-six sea-going and twenty-

five river steamers belonging to the port.

   There are also belonging to places on the waters of the Humber, more or

less, but chiefly trading with our port, twentj'^-six steam-vrssels of different
kinds, and there are about twenty to twenty-three steam-ships belonging to
other English ports and foreign states regularly trading to Hull, giving a

total of about 140 in one way or other using the port of Hull ; while in 1853
the total fleet of every class and country amounted to eighty-one, giving an

increase of fifty-nine.

   Notwithstanding the many losses and changes which have occurred amongst
our steam-vessels since my Report at Aberdeen two years ago, I am enabled

--to say that we never possessed so numerous and so fine a fleet as at the

present time, a fleet which, for efficiency and seaworthiness, may compare,

tonnage for tonnage, with any other port.
    It is not, however, the number of sleam-ships connected with the port that

is the true criterion on which to judge of an advance or otherwise, but the

amount of tonnage of actual business performed on which we can draw true

conclusions; and I find as a proof, that while in 1840 the gross tonnage
(steam and sailing) on which dock dues were paid amounted only to
652,508, in 1852 it had reached 799,866, and in 1860 it had attained
 1,215,203 tons ; and while the actual steam tonnage in 1840 only amounted
to 174,832, in 1852 it had reached 305,021, and in 1860 it M'as found to be

603,328, having within a fraction doubled in eight years. And what is still

more remarkable is, that although steam is fast taking the lead, and has so
 wonderfully advanced, the sailing-ship tonnage has also in a most astonishing
 ratio increased; for in 1840 this class of tonnage amounted to 477,676, in
 1852 to 494,845, and in 1860 to no less than 611,875 tons.
--240 REPORT ^1861.

    The above statements of tonnage relate solely to inward traffic, and not

outward.

   These facts not only justify the Dock Company in the steps they are now-

taking to extend the dock-space and wharfage-accommodation so imperatively
demanded, but will show the necessity of still further providing for the great
increase of space which, from the rapidly growing trade, and the increase in

number and size of our steam-ships, we may fairly anticipate will shortly be

wanted.

   To check and hold back the supply of necessary water-space is to produce

a retrograde effect; and not to meet the wants of the port is to encourage

any rivals who may be ambitious enough to attempt to take our trade from us.

    Great inconvenience has long been felt by steam-ship owners for want of
more extended accommodation. At present the total area of the dock is
under 43 acres for the whole of the shipping; but to give the facilities

required it ought to be double that amount. An extension of 17 acres is,

however, at once to be added to the present space in the construction of the
Western Dock, specially for the steam-shipping, in addition too of an enlarged

entrance tidal basin to be common to the Humber and Western Docks.
   Let therefore the Dock Company be true to its own real interests and those

of the port at large, and long delays and expensive conflicts in obtaining the
necessary accommodation for the rapidly increasing fleet of steamers will no
longer be known and felt, and Hull, which has long held the proud position
of the third British port, will still continue to maintain that honourable post.

   With the young and vigorous new blood recently imported into the directory
of the Company, and with its active, talented, and enterprising officers at the
head of its executive, the port asks for and expects extension of dock-space
and every modern and improved appliance, to facilitate all the varied opera-
tions, and to meet liberally all its rapidly growing wants.

    I have only to add that during the last ten years upwards of 120 steam-
ships have been built and equipped at the port of Hull, several of which are
from 1000 to 3000 tons burthen, reflecting the highest credit both on the
builders as well as on the port.

  Brief Summary of a Report on the Flora of the North of Ireland.
                         By Professor G. Dickie, M.D.

The district to which the Report refers comprehends that part of Ireland

which lies to the north of a line passing to the west from Dundalk, em-
bracing ten entire counties and part of other two.

   The information respecting the native flora of this district has been derived

--mainly from the following sources: Dr. Mackay's 'Flora of Ireland ;' a

valuable list contributed by D. Moore, Esq., of the Glasnevin Botanic

Garden ; notes contributed by Mr. Hyndman, of Belfast ; the MSS. of the
late Mr. Templeton, of Cranmore, liberally placed at my disposal by Mrs.

Templeton ; and lastly, records of species observed by myself during ex-

cursions to different parts of the north of Ireland.

   Details will be given in the full Report for insertion in the next volume
of the Transactions of the Association.

   It will be sufficient here to give a summary of the results. The standard
adopted is the ' British Flora,' by Sir W. J. Hooker and Prof. Arnott; and

in order to bring out the botanical features of the district, the types of

Mr. Watson (in his ' Cybele Britannica ') afford the best means for comparison.
PSYCHICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF THE MINCOPIES. 241

The total number of species of PhEenogams in the district may be estimated

at 725. In tlie entire flora of the United Kingdom, those of the English
type are 396, the Scottish 68, Highland 108, Germanic 196, Atlantic 60.
In the district there are 166 of the Englisii type, 39 Scottish, 22 Highland,
17 Atlantic, and 3 only of the Germanic type; the remainder of course
embracing those of general occurrence in Britain, hence called the British

type.

   The flora therefore is characterized by a large admixture of species

belonging to the English and Scottish types, with a fair proportion of those
called Western or Ai;lantic ; the number of Highland species is small, a»
might have been expected, owing to the physical characters of the country

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

those of the Germanic type are still fewer, only three out of 196 British

species being referred to that type.

On the Ps7/chical and Physical Characters of the Mincopies, or Natives
   of the Andaman Islands, and on the Relations thereby indicated to other
  Races of Mankind. By Professor Owen, F.R.S. ^c.

       [A communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

The Andaman Islands extend from 10° 32' to 13° 10' N. lat., and are situ-

ated in 92° 30' E. long. : they are divided into Great and Little ; the former,
consisting of three islands, called North, Middle, and South Andamans, are
so closely contiguous as to form one tract of 140 miles long, and not more
than 20 miles across the greatest breadth, having a surface of 2800 square
miles, and inhabited by a race of undersized or dwarf blacks, notorious for
tbeir audacity and implacable hostility to all strangers. The skin is of a sooty
darkness ; the hair of the head black, crisp, apparently short, and growing in
small detached tufts ; the nose is broad, short, and rather flat, but not parti-
cularly widened at the end, with the expanded nostrils of the Guinea negro;
the lips are thick, but less prominent than in the Guinea negro : they are

said to shave off or eradicate the hair of the face, except the eyelashes ; it is

doubtful, at least, whether naturally they are devoid, as they appear, of beard,

moustaches, and whiskers. The hands and feet are small ; but the heel does
not project, as in some African negroes.

   The following notices of the habits and manners of the Mincopies, or
natives of the Andamans, are condensed from the "Reports" of the able
Superintendents and Surveyors of the convict settlements recently established
by the East Indian Government on these islands; particularly from the state-
ment of a Brchmin Sepoy, one of the transported mutineers, who, alter esca-
ping from the convict establishment, passed upwards of a year (From April 23,

1858, to May 17, 185^) with a tribe of Andamaners*. His statement

accorded with previous accounts, that the diminutive aborigines of these
islands have no notions of a Deity or a future state ; that both sexes go naked.

   They generally inhabit the jungle along the sea-coast ; but are migratory,
rarely residing many days in one spot. They are divided into parties of from
twenty to three hundred, including the usual proportion of males and females,
adults and children ; all having similar features, colour of skin and eyes,
the same language, habits, and customs. After puberty, the females have
promiscuous sexual intercourse, save with their own father, until they are
chosen or allotted as a wife, when she is required to be faithful to her hus-

band, whom she serves. Brothers may have connexion with their sisters
until the latter are married. Sexual connexion may take place before the
men, women, and children of the party. " If any married or single man goes

to an unmarried woman, and she declines to have intercourse with him, by
sitting up or going to another part of the circle, he considers himself insulted,

and, unless restrained, would kill or wound her. I have seen a young woman
severely wounded in the thigh in such a case. All the women ran away
into the jungle, and the men who restrained the violent man from further

wounding her seemed to regard the matter lightly, as they laughed while
they held him back*."

    The bridegroom and bride smear their bodies in stripes with red earth

moistened with turtle-oil, and squat on leaves spread over the ground ten or

twelve paces apart. They sit in silence for about an hour. The man who

marries them takes the bridegroom by the hand and leads him to where the
bride is, and having seated him, without saying a word, presents him with
five or six iron-headed arrows, and leaves them sitting in silence by each other

until it is dark.

   A pregnant woman performs her duties almost to the time labour com-

mences. The party halts an extra day when she is confined. Several
female friends collect around the woman in labour to assist her by punkahing

away the flies and mosquitos. When the child is about to be born, she stands

up, supported by the females, spreads out her legs, and the child is taken

into the hands of one of the women ready to receive it. The umbilical cord

is cut, about a finger's breadth from the body, but no ligature is applied.

The afterbirth is allowed to be voided without assistance. Some hours after,

the mother is anointed with the usual unguent of red earth and turtle-oil
she eats and drinks as usual. Convalescence is very rapid ; and if the party

has to move on the morrow, the recently-delivered woman accompanies them
on foot. The child is washed in cold fresh water, poured upon it either from
a bamboo water- vessel or a shell. Its wet body is dried by the hand, which

is heated before the fire, and quickly and repeatedly but very gently applied.

Any woman of the party who is suckling gives the new-born child her breast

for a day or two until its mother's milk comes : children are suckled as long as
 their mothers have milk to give them. If it rains during a march, a few leaves
are sewn together with rattan, and used as a covering for the infant. The
parents are fond of the children, and reciprocally.

    The men go into the jungle to hunt for pigs ; the women stay in the en-

campment, supply the drinking-water, firewood, catch fish and shell-fish, cook
the food ready for the men's return, make small fishing-nets, baskets, and
spin twine. They catch the fish left by the ebb-tide by means of a small
hand-net stretched over a hoop, and collect shell-fish from the rocks. They
tattoo by incising the skin with small pieces of glass, without inserting

colouring-matter, the cicatrix being whiter than the sound skin. The women

.make a sling, six inches wide, to suspend the infant or young child, which

sits in the loose turn, with the legs passing over the mother's loins or hips.
    Boys about the age of three years play with little bows and arrows, and

when about eight years they are capable of taking a good aim and accom-
pany their fathers into the jungle. The girls are very fond of playing

with the sand on the beach, raising it into a circle or square around them,
calling the interior their house (boov), and imitating the manners of their
mothers.

    In their encampments, which enclose an open central place, there is

usually one hut, square in form, built and roofed in with much more care

and attention than the others, and generally richer in pigs' and turtles' heads ;

it is the residence of the local chief, who issues the orders as to the fight and

retreat when necessary.

On a death occurring, the corpse is removed from the interior of the hut to

a distance of a pace or two, where it remains until burial, which takes place

a few hours after. The thighs are drawn up to the belly, the legs flexed upon

the thighs ; the arms placed straight upon the chest and belly, so that the

hands project between the thighs; and thus, enveloped in leaves, the body is

tied up like a bundle by cordage of strong creepers, the ends being knotted

together to form a sling, which the carrier, with his back turned towards the

corpse, puts over his head and shoulders, and with the assistance of two men

rises with his burden, and is accompanied by two or three men, relatives of

the deceased, to the burial-place. This is usually about a mile inland from

the sea-shore. The grave is an irregularly round hole about three feet deep,

dug with a pointed piece of stick, the earth being thrown out by the hands.

The body is lifted into the grave by means of the sling, the earth filled in and

forming a small mound.

   Before the corpse is prepared for burial, the wife and one or two near rela-

tives sit down and weep over it. Two or three months after burial, when the

flesh has decomposed and been eaten by land-crabs and ants, some near rela-

tives of the deceased proceed to the spot and disinter the bones ; and having

bound them together with creeper-cords, carry them to the encampment and

spread them out, when these are wept over by the relatives, each of whom takes

a bone, the nearest relative taking the skull and lower jaw, which may be

carried suspended by a cord from the neck for months. The bones are some-

times bound to the posts of the hut.

The chief weapons of the Andaman race are bows and arrows, the latter

Awith iron heads.  chief has been observed to have a spear, his bow and

arrows being carried by a henchman.

   The hair is shaved, the skin scarified in certain maladies, and the tattooing

--performed by pieces of glass chips of bottle-glass skilfully detached by sharp

blows of a stone.

The materials for the above weapons, viz. iron and glass, are obtained from

wrecks. If flint-nodules were present in the Andamans, no doubt the native

instinct, and notices of the appearances of accidental fractures of such nodules,

would have led to the formation of the primitive knife from flint, as from glass.

The Andamaners appear to be devoid of fear; they are powerful for their

size ;  can  carry greater  burdens  than  the  Hindoos                                        are  swift  runners,  and
                                                                                            ;

clear rapidly, by jumping, the fallen trees of the jungle and rocks of the tidal

shore. As climbers they are little inferior to monkeys, being used from child-

hood to climb the lofty, straight, unbranched trees of the forest in quest of
fruit and honey. They are excellent swimmers from their childhood, and

wonderful divers, "fishing for shell-fish in deep water." "I have seen,"
deposes the sepoy, " three or four of them dive into deep water and bring up

in their arms a fish, six or seven feet in length, which they had seized." ....
" They could perceive canoes approaching long before they were visible tome,

and could see fruits and honeycombs in the jungle which I could not. Their

vision penetrates to great depths in the sea, where they could see and shoot
fish with arrows, when the object aimed at was not apparent to me. They

see well at night, catching fish in the pools left by the tide at that season, and

shooting the wild pigs which come to the coast to drink by night." By their

acute sense of smell they often detect afar off the existence of fruit in the

neighbouring lofty trees.

                                                                                                           r2

                                  --

In regard to their maladies, the sepoy deposes : "I never met with any

one affected with gonorrhoea, syphilis, itch, piles, small-pox, or goitre ; but

I have seen them affected with vomiting, colic, diarrhoea, intermittent fever,
headache, ear-ache, toothache, abscesses, rheumatism, catarrh, cough, painful
and difficult respiration. The only remedies I have seen used are ' red earth

rubbed up with turtle-oil,' a cold infusion of certain aromatic leaves, the
wetted leaves being applied to the head or other inflamed parts, and local

bleedings by sharp splinters of bottle glass."

   They spin ropes, make wicker baskets, large nets for catching turtle,
smaller nets for catching fishes ; and they scoop out their canoes by means

of a small kind of adze, tipped by a semicircular blade of iron. Thus, for

all their immediate wants, invention has supplied the instruments called
for by the nature of the surrounding objects and sources of food. " It is
impossible," writes Dr. Mouatt, Inspector- General of Jails, Calcutta, "to

imagine any human beings to be lower in the scale of civilization than are
the Andaman savages. Entirely destitute of clothing, utterly ignorant of

agriculture, living in the most primitive and rudest form of habitations, their
only care seems to be the supply of their daily food." Thus the low grade of
humanity, hardly raised above that of the brute animal, with the dwarfish
stature and dark sooty colour of the Andamaners, have always made a further

knowledge of their physical characters peculiarly desirable.

   I am enabled to contribute the present notice of the osteological and dental
characters of the Mincopie race, by the opportunity kindly afforded me by
Dr. Fred. J. Mouatt, Inspector of Indian Jails, who brought over the bones of

an adult male native of the Andamans, which he has since presented to the
British Museum. The proportions of the bones indicate a well-formed, robust,
adult male of four feet ten inches in height. The bones present a compact

sound texture, with the processes, articular surfaces, and places of muscular

attachments neatly defined. The cranium (Plates VI. and VII.) is well
formed, not exceeding disproportionately in any diameter ; it might be classed
with those of the oval type (Plate VII. figs. 1 and 2). The frontal region

is rather narrow, but not very low for the size of the cranium ; it recedes or
passes by a regular curve from the glabella (Plate VI. g) upward and back-

ward to the vertex, v. The frontal, much of the sagittal, and the upper part

of the coronal sutures are obliterated. Part of the lambdoidal suture is very

complex, and sinks below the level of the contiguous bones at the lower
angle and ' additamentum,' /. The alisphenoid (g) joins the parietal (;) on

both sides of the head. The glabella is but little prominent ; the nasals (15)
are not flat, but are moderately developed. The alveolar parts of the upper
and lower jaws slightly project. The chin is a little produced, is not deep.

The malar bones (26) are not unusually prominent : in this respect, as well as

in the minor breadth of the cranium, the skull departs from the type of the

Malay. The zygomatic process of the squamosal (27) is slender. The

styliform process of the alisphenoid overlaps the inner angle of the vaginal

process. The cranial bones are not above the average thickness.

The following are the principal dimensions of this cranium :

                                                                  in. lin.

    The spine of the occiput is not so developed as to interrupt the convex con-
 tour of the occipital part of the skull ; the lower occipital crest is rather more
 developed than the upper one. The mastoids (s) are moderately developed;
 there is no supermastoid ridge, nor any process from the paroccipital (4). The
 base of the skull offers all the strictly human characteristics. There is no ex-

 cess in the size of the orbits or of the auditory apertures ; a sharp ridge pro-

jects from the lower boundary of the anterior nares. The lower jaw shows a

 variety in the shape of the coronoid process (so) which is occasionally seen in
 Europeans ; it is broader and lower than usual ; the front border is more
 convex at its upper half, and forms with the concave lower part a deeper and
more decided sigmoid curve. The ascending ramus forms a less open angle
with the horizontal ramus than in most Negro and Australian skulls.

    The teeth (Plate VII. fig. 3) equal in size the average of those of Indo-Eu-
ropeans ; they correspond in this respect with those of the European figured

in my ' Odontography,' plates 118 and 119. Although they are large in pro-

portion to the size of the jaws, they are markedly smaller than are those of
the Australian figured in the same plates. In the upper jaw of the male
Andamaner the true molars, as in most Europeans, diminish in size from the
first (m I) to the third (w 3). The fissure which penetrates the grinding
surface from the outer side to the middle of the crown had its end unoblite-

m mrated in 1, and retained its whole length in 2. The enamel was worn
mfrom the inner half in both teeth, but in a less proportion in 2 ; it was also
mslightly worn from the outer tubercles in 1. The degree of abrasion of the

teeth, according to the age of the individual, is such as might be expected
from the mastication of a diet consisting chiefly of fish and fruit. In the

lower jaw the dentine is exposed on the three outer tubercles of m 1 ; the
mcrucial figure is not obliterated in 2 ; ?n 3 is larger, as usual, than in the

corresponding tooth above. The upper premolars are implanted by a fang
which is divided at its base into an outer and inner root. The undivided fang

of the lower premolars is longitudinally grooved on the outer side. In the

mupper jaw, m 1 and 2 are implanted by one inner and two outer roots, m 3

by one antero-external root and one postero- internal root. All the lower
molars have distinct anterior and posterior roots. There was no irregularity
in the position, nor any sign of decay in the teeth.

   The articulations of the skull with the vertebral column in the present
skeleton of the Andamaner agree with those of the male sex in the highest
variety of the human species. One of the most characteristic differences
between man and all other mammals consists in the fact that the human

head is balanced in the erect posture, only requiring slight muscular action

to steady it, M'hile the skull of the chimpanzee and all lower mammals pre-

ponderates anteriorly, and needs to be sustained by the action of powerful

muscles and elastic structures. To preserve the equilibrium of the human

head, the cerebrum in its growth extends more backward than forward, deve-
lopes the posterior lobes with their contained structures peculiar to man, and
produces a concomitant exjjansion and production of the occipital part of the
cranium during the progress of general growth from infancy to adult age,
whereby the back of the head becomes balanced against the increasing weight

of the face.

    All the bones of the trunk and limbs of the male Mincopie present the specific

and generic characters of Homo sapiens, Linn. The sigmoid flexure of the
clavicle (52) is well marked. The scajiula (51) agrees with that variety of form

which shows a minor extent of the supraspinal tract, and a greater breadth
of the lower part of the subspinal tract, with a more produced angle between
the surfaces for the teres major and teres minor muscles, on the inferior costa.
                                   --

246 REPORT 1861.

The inferior costa describes a continuous concave curve from the angle to the
base of the coracoid, without any suprascapular notch. The os innominatum,

calcaneum, astragalus, and bones of the hallux or great toe, peculiar to man,
contrasted as strongly with the quadrumanous characters of those bones as in

the highest of the humaa races. The first lumbar vertebra had the diapophysis,

metapophysis, and anapophysis distinct, and almost equally developed, and
well illustrated the true serial homology of the longer diapophysis of the suc-

ceeding lumbars. In many European skeletons the diapophyses of the first
lumbar vertebra are more developed than in that of the Andamaner. The

ridges, processes, and surfaces for muscular attachment are well and neatly
defined on the several limb-bones of this skeleton, and agree with the charac-

ter for agility in running, climbing, and swimming assigned to the Andaman

race.

   The following are the dimensions of the limb-bones :

gines ; and merely resemble Negroes in a blackness, or rather sootiness, of
the tegumentary pigment, which might be due to constant exposure during

many generations of this nude and primitive race. Their prognathism is not

more than is found in most of the Southern Asiatic peoples, and indeed in

the lower orders of men in all countries, and may be due or relate to the
prolonged sucking of the plastic infant. The growth of the short, crisp hair

of the scalp, by small tufts, shows a resemblance of the Andamaners to certain

Papuans, as, e.g., those of New Caledonia. But the skull and dentition of the

Andaman male are as distinct from the Australian type as from that of the

West-coast Negro. There is no supranasal ridge due to a sunken origin of

the flattened nasal (is) bones ; neither the malar (26) nor zygomatic arches

show the strength and prominence that mark them in the Australian male

there is no excessive size of molar or other teeth. The styliform processes of

the alisphenoid are more produced ;  the lambdoidal suture is more complex
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

the alisphenoids (e) are relatively broader. From the present opportunity of

studying the osteology and dentition of the Andamaner, the ethnologist derives

as little indication or ground of surmise of the origin of the race in question

from an Australasian as from an African continent ; and there is scarcely

better evidence of his Malayan or Mongolian ancestry. Upon the whole, the

skull offers the greatest amount of correspondence with those of such of the

dwarfish, dark, and presumed aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines, Java,

Borneo, and Ceylon, which I have had the ojjportunity of examining. I cite

the descriptions of two of these crania from my Catalogue of the Osteolo-

gical Series in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In that of

an aboriginal native of Luzon (No. 5.531), " the cranium is short, moderately

broad, rather low, with a narrow and receding forehead. The glabella is

prominent through the development of the frontal sinuses ; the nasals are

moderately prominent, as are likewise the malars and upper jaw. The chin

is well developed. The entire skull is rather small. The chief individual

peculiarity is seen in the development of the right paroccipital, which is

longer than the mastoid, and presents an articular surface for joining its

homotype, the diapophysis of the atlas. The left paroccipital tubercle is

also well marked. The deviation from the Human type here presented, if

compared with the skull of an inferior mammal, e. g. the Bear, or the Dog,

will be perceived to be a return to a more general type, which is manifested by

the more constant development, in the Mammalian series, of the paroccipitals

or transverse processes of the occipital vertebra." (Vol. ii. p. 861.) In the cra-

nium of a Veddah, or aboriginal of Ceylon (No. 5539), "the cranial cavity is of

small size, with the forehead narrow and receding : the glabella is moderately

prominent through the development of the frontal sinuses. The sutures are

well marked ; that of the lambdoid is particularly complex, and sinks below

the level of the contiguous bones at its lower angles*. The supramastoid

ridge is well marked; the mastoids are moderately developed: the paroccipitals

are rudimentary. The zygomatic processes of the temporals are very slender

those of the malars have the lower border convex, descending below them.

The styliform processes of the alisphenoid are low, or short, subquadrate, but

unusually extended backwards and outvi-ards, overlapping the inner angle of the

Avaginal processes.  trace of the maxillo-premaxillary suture remains on

the palate : the maxilla is slightly prognathic : the molar teeth are small.

This cranium has probably belonged to a female : it agrees in the chief cha-

racters with the skull from the Philippines (No. 5531)." (lb. p. 863.)

   I am not cognizant of any anatomical grounds for deriving the Andaman

people from any existing continent ; but, in making these remarks, I would

offer no encouragement to the belief that they originated in the locality to

which they are now limited.
   It has been said that " their language shows them to belong to the same

division with the Burmese of the opposite continent." But late vocabularies

oppose this view. The Burmese, moreover, show the average stature of

the  southern  Asiatic  men                           and  it would be as pure an assumption to affirm
                                                   ;

that they had been derived from the Andamaners, as that these were degenerate

descendants of the Burmese.

The few undersized, dark-skinned aborigines, as they are termed, of the

Great Nicobar, of the Philippines, of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Ceylon, are

driven furtliest into the interior by immigrants of other races, and are the

least likely to have emigrated or equipped vessels for the purpose of voyaging

to other lands. The average-sized Malay and Chinese, and the like later

colonists of the Indian Archipelago, are those that have the command of the

sea ; and the Andamaners are certainly not their descendants.

Combined geological, geographical, and zoological researches have made

us cognizant of the fact of the formation and destruction of continental tracts

of land in the known course of the earth's period of existence. The Andaman
Islands, like the Nicobar, Java, Sumatra, and Ceylon, may have been parts

of some former tract of dry land, distinct from, and perhaps pre-existent to,

that neighbouring and more northern continent which has been the scene of
the elevation of the Himalayan range of mountains, in part perhaps a great

-- --part within the tertiary period. This has been the opinion of geologists

for some time back, and is alluded to by Professor Ansted in his 'Ancient

World,' pp. 322, 324. The extensive collections and assiduous comparisons
of the animals of Ceylon by Sir J. Emerson Tennent have added valuable

evidence in favour of such opinion*. The Andamans are forty miles distant

from the nearest islands, the Cocos, on their north, and seventj'-two miles

distant from the Nicobar Islands on their south. There is a mountain 2400

feet in height called " Saddle Peek," probably volcanic, on the main island;
and there is a volcanic island in the. vicinity called " Barren Island,'' with an

active volcano. The whole of the shores of the Andamans are skirted by

continuous coral-reefs. It is plain that the Andamans are the active seat of

Wethose causes that influence the change in the relations of land to sea.

should doubtless err, therefore, in any speculation on the origin of their popu-

lation, if we were to assume that the Andaman Islands were such as they

now are when they received their first human inhabitants.
   The cardinal defect of speculators on the origin of the human species

seems to me to be the assumption that the present geographical condition of

the earth's surface preceded or coexisted with the origin of such species.

The monogenist, on that assumption, bent on tracing all human races ft-om

one source and one existent centre, exaggerates the application and value
of casual remarks to show, for example, that " the Australians are not

a pure race, but hybrids between true Negroes and a Malayan or yellow

race." (See Quatrefages' ' Unite de I'Espece Humaine,' 12mo, 1861, p. 173.)

And the poh'genist invokes a separate creation of each race for each existing

continent or island-home of such race. (Agassiz, in Nott and Gliddon's

'Types of Mankind.')

"The Andamaners are perhaps the most primitive, or lowest in the scale of

civilization, of the human race. They have no tradition, and, as has been
before remarked, apparently no notion of their own origin. Finding in their

bows and arrows and their hand-nets implements that answer for acquiring

the principal articles of food which their locality yields, they have carried

the inventive faculties no further. At best they may have availed themselves

of the wrecks during the last century or two of their insular existence, to

barb their arrows with iron instead of fish-bone, and to get from broken

bottles such trenchant fragments as our oldest-known Europeans obtained

from broken flints. The animal appetites are gratified in the simplest

animal fashion ; there is no sense of nakedness, no sentiment of shame.

The man, choosing promiscuously for one or more years after puberty, then

takes, or has assigned to him, a female who becomes his exclusive mate and

servant ; and the reason assigned for this monogamy is that she may be

restricted, while he may continue to select from the unmarried females as

before. The climate dispenses with the necessity of any other protection of

the body than a paste of earth and oil. Any rudiment of a cincture relates

solely to the convenience of the suspension of weapons or other portable

objects. They are not cannibals. Implacably hostile to strangers, the

Andamaners have made no advance in the few centuries during which their

seas have been traversed by ships of higher races. Perhaps the sole change

is that of the materials for weapons derived from casual wrecks, to which

allusion has already been made.

Enjoying, therefore, the merest animal life during those centuries, why

may they not have so existed for thousands of years .'' I'he conditions of

existence being such as they now enjoy, on what can the ethnologist found

an idea of the limitation of the period during which the successive genera-

tions of Andamaners have continued so to exist ? Antecedent generations of

the race may have coexisted with the slow and gradual geological changes

which have obliterated the place or continent of their primitive origin, what-

ever be the hypothesis adopted regarding it.

In every essential of human physical character, however, the present Min-

copies or Andamaners participate with their more intellectually gifted

brethren. The size of the brain, indicated by the cranial chamber, promises

aptitude for civilization. The Andamaners resemble the orangs and chim-

panzeee only in their diminutive stature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   but this is associated with the well-

Report from the Balloon Committee. By Colonel Syk^s,M.P.,F.R.S.

Professor Walker, after the appointment of the Committee at the Aberdeen

Meeting, having communicated to Colonel S\ kes his inability to undertake
anj- active labours with respect to carrying out the objects for which the
Committee was nominated, Colonel Sykes put himself into correspondence

with Mr. Langley, a gentleman of Newcastle, who offered to construct a
suitable balloon, provided an advance of money were made to him. The cor-

respondence however was without result, and Colonel Sykes in consequence
thought it unnecessary to invite the opinions of the other members of the
Committee with respect to the objects to be sought for in balloon-ascents,
--250 REPORT 1861.

as means were wanting, whatever those opinions might be, to give practical
effect to them. Colonel Sykes was not at the meeting at Oxford last year,
and no action having been taken by the Balloon Committee, it has dropped
through and is extinct.

    Within a few months past Mr. Simpson, of Creraorne Gardens, has con-
structed a balloon at a cost of £600 (the ' Normandie'), with a sufficient
capacity to carry two persons to great heights, which might be available for
the objects of the Association. The occasion has therefore arisen when the
re-appointment of a Balloon Committee might take place; and as one of the
chief objects of the last Balloon Committee, viz. the verification of the former
results of the ascents undertaken by the authority of the Association, remains
unchanged. Colonel Sykes, with the approval of those members of the late

Balloon Committee with whom he has had an opportunity of conversing, will

move the re-appointment of the Committee with a grant of £200.

Report on the Repetition of the Magnetic Survey of England, made at
   the request of the General Committee of the British Association.

  By Major-General Edward Sabine, R.A., President of the Royal

     Society.

The Magnetic Survey of the British Islands, corresponding to the epoch of

January 1, 1837, which had been undertaken in 1836 at the request of the
British Association, was completed in 1838, and a coordinated Report of the

observations of the Dip and Force, contributed by each of the five Members of
the Association who had cooperated in the execution of the Survey, was pub-
lished in the annual volume for 1838, accompanied by Maps of the Isoclinal
and Isodynamic Lines embodying tiie results of the Survey. The observa-
tions of the third element, the Declination, which were made chiefly by one
of the cooperators, Sir James Clark Ross, were not published until a later

date, when, having been reduced and coordinated by myself, they were
included in a memoir printed in the Philosophical Transactions for IS^Q,

entitled "On the Isogonic Lines, or Lines of equal Magnetic Declination in

the Atlantic Ocean in 1840," in which they completed in a very satisfactory
manner the N.E. portion of the map accompanying that memoir.

   The Magnetic Survey of 1837 deserves to be remembered as having been
the first complete work of its kind planned and executed in any country

as a national work, coextensive witii the limits of the state or country, and

embracinj; the three magnetic elements. The example thus presented was

speedily followed by the execution of similar undertakings in several parts of
the globe ; more particularly in the Austrian and Bavarian dominions, and
in detached portions of the British Colonial Possessions, viz. in North America

and India. The immediate object of such surveys is to determine for the parti-

cularepoch at which they are made, the positions of Lines of equal Declination,
Inclination, and Magnetic Force in tiie area of the Survey; the angles at which
the three classes of lines respectively cross the geographical meridians ; and
the distances in geographical miles, measured in directions perpendicular to
the lines, which correspond to equal increments of each of the magnetic ele-

ments. By the extension and multiplication of such surveys far more satis-
factory materials are supplied for the construction of general magnetic maps

of the globe than are afforded by the desultory observations which had pre-
viously formed their only basis. This, as already stated, is the immediate
object of such Surveys; but they have in prospect another and a scarcely less
important purpose, in contributing by their repetition at stated intervals to
ON THE MAGNETIC SURVEY OF ENGLAND.  251

supply the best kind of data for the gradual elucidation of the laws and source
of the secular change in the distribution of the earth's magnetism, perhaps
the most remarlcable of the yet unexplained natural phenomena of the globe.

   It was in this view that the General Committee of the British Association,
assembled at Cheltenham in 1856, considering that in 1857 twenty years

--would have elapsed since the epoch of the first Survey, passed the following

Resolution, " That a Committee, consisting of General Sabine, Professor

Phillips, Sir James Clark Ross, Mr. Robert Were Fox, and the Rev. H.

Lloyd, be requested to undertake the Repetition of the Magnetic Survey of
the British Islands." The five members of the Association named in this Reso-

lution were the same by whom the former Survey had been made, and were

all living at the time of the Cheltenham Meeting, Dr. Lloyd and Mr. Phillips

being present at it. I was myself on the continent for the recovery of health,

but on my return in the autumn of 1856, finding my own name standing first

in the list of the Committee, I lost no time in making such arrangements as
seemed suitable for the accomplishment of the purpose which the Associa-
tion had in view. Dr. Lloyd undertook the Irish portion ; Scotland and the
islands to its North and West were placed, with the consent of the

Committee of the Kew Observatory, in the able hands of Mr. Welsh, the

Superintendent of that establishment, and a grant of £200 was obtained from
the Admiralty towards the payment of his travelling expenses. For some

time I cherished the hope that the repetition of the English Survey might be

accomplished (as on the previous occasion) by the joint labours of the Mem-

bers of the Committee : but at len{:th it became evident that circumstances
of health or the pressure of other employments and duties stood in the way of
a combined operation ; which would have ncce<sitatefi also a great amount
of additional labour in the intercomparison of the different instruments and
methods employed. I have made therefore the whole of the observations for
the isoclinal and isodynamic lines myself; but having only a portion of each

year at my disposal, they have required the summers of 1858, 1859, 1860,

and 1861, causing January 1, 1860, to become the middle epoch of the
Survey, in respect to these two of the three elements. The detail of the
observations, the conclusions derived from them, and the maps of the two

elements, constitute the two first divisions of the present Report ; the third

division, containing the observations upon which the map of the isogonic

lines for 1857 is based, together with the comparison of these lines with

those of the earlier Survey, and the deduction of the mean secular change of
this element in the interval, has been contributed by Frederick John Evans,
Esq., F.R.S., Superintendent of the Compass Observatory of the Royal Navy

at Woolwich.

   The premature decease of Mr. Welsh, accelerated it is feared by his too

persistent exposure in the second year of the Scottish Survey, left the reduc-

tion and publication of the northern portion of the British Survey to his

successor at Kew, Mr. Balfour Stewart, by whom a report has been presented

to the General Committee, which report is printed in the atmual volume for
1859. There remains, therefore, now, for the entire fulfilment of the desire
embodied in the Resolution of the General Committee at Cheltenham in
1856, only the Irish portion of the Survey, which has been undertaken by

Dr. Lloyd, to whom have been added as coadjutors, by his own request, the

Rev. Professors Galbraith and Haughton, and George Johnstone Stoney, Esq.

Dr. Lloyd has acquainted me that it is his wish, and that of the gentlemen

associated with liim, that the Irish portion of the Survey should be published

in the ' Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy.' The present is there-
fore the concluding Report aildressed to the British Association of the
Committee nominated by them at the Cheltenham Meeting in 1856.

--252 REPORT 1861.

Division I. Dip.

In selecting an instrument to be employed, in a magnetic survey, for the

purpose of determining the position, direction, and distance apart of the

isoclinal lines, care must be taiien, 1st, that its " probable error" be small, so

that the observations made at the different stations of the survey may be

as far as possible comparable with each other; and 2nd, that what is usually
termed the " Index Error " be either so small as to be practically insignificant,

or that, if of significant amount, its value should be carefully determined by

a sufficient examination at a base station, so that the general conclusions of

the survey may be comparable with those of similar surveys made in other

countries at the same epoch. The instrument selected for this survey was

one of the well-known English pattern which has been adopted for some

years past at the Kew Observatory; the circle was 6 inches in diameter,

fitted with both verniers and microscopes, and with two needles, each 3|

inches in length. An examiriation of the results obtained with twelve circles of

this pattern with their ^^ needles in 282 determinations made by different

observers at the Kew Observatory, has been published in the 11th volume of

the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,' pp. 14'5-162. The circle there

distinguished as No. 30 was the one selected for the English survey, and

was employed at all the stations of observation in 185S, 18,59, and 1860. In

the autumn of I860, the English survey being tiien supposed to have been

completed, No. 30 was sent to the Magnetic Observatory at the Isle Jesus,

near Montreal in Canada, on the a])plication of Dr. Smallwood, Director of

that observatory ; but the pressure of other avocations having obliged me

to defer for a few months the preparation for the press of the results obtained

in 1858, 1859, and I860, I was enabled in the summer of 1861 to add four

more stations on the eastern coast of England, and for these observations

I obtained from the Kew Observatory the use of the Circle No. 3f?, which

(with its two needles) had been one of the twelve employed in the- com-

parison at Kew, of which the account is publi>hed in the ' Proceedings of

the Royal Society' as above stated. Referring to that account, it will be

seen that 28 of the 282 determinations at Kew with the twelve circles were

made with No. 30, and 4-9 with No. 33 ; and after the proper corrections for

secular change and annual variation, we find the " probable error" of a single

± +determmation to be with No. 30 r-25, and with No. 33 r-18 ; whilst the

"probable error" derived from the 282 determinations obtained with the

Wetwelve circles is +l''45.  may therefore regard Nos. 30 and 33 as instru-

ments superior rather than inferior, in the intercomparability of the results

obtained with them, to the average of their class; which class is, I believe,

unsurpassed by any other form of instruments in use either in our own or in

any other country for the determination of the magnetic dip.

In regard to the question whether any and what " index correction " should

be applied to the results obtained with Nos. 30 and 33, it may be seen by

an examination of the results in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society'

already referred to, that the mean result of the 28 determinations at Kew

with No.30 exceeded the mean ofthe282 determinations with the twelve circles

by +0''8, and the mean of the 49 determinations with No. 33 exceeded the

mean of the 282 by +0'"7. These differences have appeared too small to

require the assignment of a specific index correction to Nos. 30 or 33 ; it is

sufficient to record the circumstance, and to remark that it is possible that

the values of the isoclinal lines at the epoch of January Jst, 1860, given in

the present memoir, which rest on the results obtained witii these circles,

may be a fraction of a minute, or even a whole minute too high.

   I proceed in the following Table to state the observations of the Dip made
with Nos. 30 and 33 at the several stations of this survey : the observations
were made by myself, unless where otherwise noted.

   This comparison shows that the mean annual secular change in the interval
between the surveys was a decrease of 2'"49 at Margate on the east coast, and

of 2'*93 at Lew Trenchard on the borders of Devonshire and Cornwall.
   The amount of the difference in the rate of secular change on the east and

west coasts corresponding to the change in the value of u, may be further
and more fully exemplified by comparing the values of the dip at the two

epochs 1837 and 1860 at Lowestoft on the extreme east of England, and at

the Land's End at the extreme west ; the values in 1837 being taken from
the map of the isoclinal lines for January 1837 accompanying the report of

the survey of that epoch, and those in 1860 being computed by the formula
obtained by the survey of 1860.

   If we now bring together the values of the annual secular change during

the 23 years preceding 1860 as shown by these four comparisons, placing them
in order from East to West across our island, and introducing in its proper

place 2''63, the annual secular change at Kew in the 21 years preceding 1859

as known from other sources (Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xi.p. 158),
we have as follows :

Lowestoft                     2-36          Lew Trenchard   2-93
                                            Land's End      3-09
Margate                       249

Kew                           2-63

   The increase in proceeding from east to west is shown consistently. The

annual values derived from determinations including intervals of above

20 years, are of course mean values. The surveys furnish no direct means
of judging whether the secular change has been uniform or otherwise at any
of the stations. At one of the stations only, i. e. Kew, we have reason to
believe, from the observations recorded in the ' Proceedings of the Royal

Society ' referred to above, that the change has been uniform during the
whole period from 1837 to 1860 (and also for several years preceding 1837) ;

but we are not entitled to assume a similar uniformity at any of the other

stations.

   Proceeding now to the increase in the value of r in the interval between

--the two surveys, the difference in the rate of secular change of dip in the

northern and southern parts of England which is implied thereby may be

similarly shown, by comparing the dips in 1837 and 1860 at two geographical

positions, one iu the extreme north, and the other in the extreme soutli of

England. Taking as the northern station the intersection in the map of

these values with the values computed for January 1860 by the formula cor-
responding to that epoch, we have

Annualchange                          2'-05

The comparison shows that the mean annual secular change in the interval

of 23 years between the surveys was 2''05 on the northern border of England,

and 2'-68 at a station on the south coast. Tlius it is seen that the annual

rate of decrease of dip has varied in different parts of England in proceeding

from east to west, from 2'-36 at Lowestoft to 3'-09 at the Land's End ; and

in proceeding from north to south from 2'*05 at a position in 55° to 2'-68 at

a position in 51° N. latitude.

In viewing the map in which the isoclinal lines for 1837 and 1860 are

represented in comparison with each other (PI. VIII.), it is seen that there

are three points where the amount of secular change in the interval must have

been the same, viz. the three points where the lines of 68°, 69°, and 70° in

1837 intersect respectively with those of 69°, 70°, and 71° in 1860; since at each

of these points themean annual change mi:st have been (60' -r 23 years =)2'*62.
These three points are seen to be in a curved line which crosses England

from the vicinity of Folkestone to the Irish Channel, and would impinge

upon the east coast of Ireland a few miles north of Dublin. Kew, also, where

the mean annual decrease of the dip in the same interval has been 2''63, is as
nearly as may be on the same line. At all stations north and east of the
line the mean annual secular change in the 23 years has been less than 2'-62,

and at all stations south and west of the line greater than 2'-62. In a pre-
ceding page we have the mean annual change at four stations (Lowestoft,

Margate, Lew Trenchard, and Land's End) situated at points on the east'

and west sides of England, and at two geographical positions {55° N. and

3° W., and 51° N. and 0° 07' E.) at north and south points. An intercom-

parison of the respective values of annual change at these six localities with

2'-62, and of their geographical distances from the aforesaid line of 2'-62

measured in every case on a perpendicular to that line, shows that an increase

of 0'"1 in the annular secular change for every 30 geographical miles towards

the N.E., and a decrease of 0'*1 for every 30 geographical miles towards the

WeS.W., will represent very approximately the observed values.  are thus

furnished with a scale by which the variation in the mean rate of the secular

decrease of the dip in different parts of England in the interval between the

two surveys may be approximately assigned; the limits being an annual

decrease of 3''1 at the Land's End, and of 2'-0 at Berwick. If we should per-

mit ourselves to extend the same scale of variation to the north of Scotland,
we should find the mean annual decrease reduced to l'-6. The very small
corrections required to reduce the results of the observations of the present

survey to a common epoch (January 1, 1860), as shown in Table II. p. 257,

have been estimated in accordance with this scale of variation : the whole of

the observations were made within two years of the common epoch.

   The line which has been indicated as connecting the intersections of the
isoclinals of 68°, 69°, and 70° of 1837 with those of 69°, 70° and 71° of 1860,
is marked on the map by a faintly dotted line. It is in fact a line com-
posed of nodal points, on which the isoclinals passing through them may be
conceived to have turned, as on pivots, in the interval of 23 years, and
(irrespective of their common and uniform movement of translation to the

north) to have undergone a change of direction, becoming more southerly on

the eastern side of the nodal line, and more northerly on its western side.

Division II. Intensity of the Magnetic Force.

For the purpose of ascertaining the position, direction, and distance apart

of the isodynamic lines, or lines of equal Total Force, two methods were

employed, viz. (a) the determination at different stations of the values in

absolute measure of the horizontal component of tlie force, which values,

being combined with the dip of the needle observed at the same time and

place, give the absolute values of the total force; and (b) the determination

of the variations of the total force itself at the different stations, by observing

the positions of equilibrium of a dipping-needle between the action of the

earth's magnetism and tiiat of a small constant weight with which the needle

is loaded. It may be convenient to discuss these methods and their results

separately ; and with this view we may commence with the determinations

of the absolute value of the Iiorizontal component of the force.

                                               full description of the ia-

App. I. of the article on " Terrestrial Magnetism " in the 3rd edition of the

* Manual of Scientific Inquiry,' published under the authority of the Ad-

miralty. The collimator magnet employed as a deflector was niniibered 5,

and was used throughout the experiments. Its moment of inertia (K), in-

cluding the suspending stirrup and other appendages, was determined at

Kew, by the late Mr. WelsJi, in June 1858, by the mean of experiments

with three cylinders B, C, and D, of which the weights and dimensions were

respectively as follows

tively to the force in London expressed by 1-0000 ; each observer taking some

spot in the immediate vicinity of London as his base station, and thus ren-

dering the results of all the observers intercomparable. The stations, their

latitudes and longitudes, the initial denoting the observer, and the observed in-

tensity of the force, are collected in the following Table (XV.) ; the initials

F., L., P., R., and S. refer respectively to Mr. Robert Were Fox, Dr. Lloyd,

Professor Phillips, Sir James Clark Ross, and myself. Adopting the same
central position as that of the present survey, viz. 52° 13' N. and 1° 38' W., we

have the coordinates of distance a and b as shown in Table XV., and combining

these data in the customary manner, we obtain 1-0051 as the representative
value of the whole series at the central position expressed in terms of its own

arbitrary scale. The force in absolute measure at the same central position

derived from the experiments of the present survey is 10-332 in British units.

Omitting for the present the consideration of any secular change which may

have taken place in the value of the force in the interval between the two

surveys, we are thus furnished with the means of expressing the results of the

first survey in terms which bring them in immediate comparison with those

of the second survey. The absolute values thus obtained for the several sta-

tions of the first survey are placed in column 8 of Table XV., and being com-

bined in the manner described in pp. 99-101 of the British Association Report
for 1836, we obtain for the survey of 1837, a-= -f -00052 1, y =+-000742,

and 52° 13' N., expressed in geographical miles. The several values thus

computed are placed in column 9, and the differences between the computed

and observed values in column 10. From the latter we find the probable

=error of a determination at a single station +-012. (Table XV. see p. 272.)

   The direction of the isodynamic lines in England thus found for the epoch

of the present survey is from N. 57° 35'-5 E. to S. 57° 35'-5 W. The direc-
tion found by the preceding survey was from N. 54° 54' E. to S. 54° 54' W.

the central position being the same in both surveys. It appears, therefore,
that the isodynamic lines passing across England have increased the angle
which they make with the geographical meridian in the interval between the
two surveys. The change is similar in character to the change in the direc-
tion of the isoclinal lines in the same interval, but somewhat less in amount.

   In the survey of 1837, the rate of increase of the magnetic force in each
geographical mile towards the N.W., measured in the direction perpendicular
to the isodynamic lines, was -00091 ; in the survey of 1860 -00106. There-

fore in the interval the increase of the force towards the N.W. had become

more rapid, and the isodynamics corresponding to equal increments of force

more closely packed. Hence we may infer that in the northern parts of

England the secular increase of the force had been greater than in the

southern parts.

at an angle of 57° 35'-5. Each has the value of 10-332 in British units

which is accurate for 1860, being subject only to errors of observation or of

the hypothesis by which the observations are combined; but in 1837 is less
certain, because no account is taken of the secular change which may have

taken place in the absolute value of the force in the interval between the

Wetwo surveys.  have no means oF estimating with precision the operation

of the secular change in this interval, inasmuch as we have no absolute

measures of the force at so early a date as that of the survey in 1837. The

only satisfactory determinations which we now possess, from which an

approximate value of the secular change for one particular station, and for a

part of the interval, may be inferred, are the absolute measures made monthly

at the Kew Observatory since April 1857. From these the force appears to

have increased between April 1857 and March 1862 at an average rate of '00125

annually. If we assume the same rate of increase to have taken place in the

same years at the central position, which is not far distant from Kew, and if

we extend the assumption so as to include the whole interval between the

two surveys, the value of the fundamental line of the survey of 1837 would

be 10-303 instead of 10-332 ; and the isodynamics for 10-200, 10-300, 10-400,

10-500, and 10-600 for 1837 in Plate ii., computed by the formula

                + +10-332 -00052 a -00074 h

(a and b being the distances in longitude and latitude in geographical miles

from the central position), and represented in the Plate by broken lines,
would each require to be diminished by 0-029. It is obvious, however, from
the increase in the value of r (viz. -00091 in the earlier survey, and -00106
in the later), that the secular increase of the force must have been greater

in the northern parts of England than at Kew, or generally those in the

Wesouthern parts of the kingdom.     must recognize also the operation of

the increase in the value o( u from 54° 54' to 57° 35''5 in producing a small
diminution in western longitudes of the secular increase observed at Kew,
and which has been inferred to have been still greater in the northern and

eastern parts. It is to be hoped that the series of monthly determinations at
Kew, which appear to give a satisfactory approximate measure of the secular

change of this element during the last five years, may be continued until the

survey be repeated at the expiration of a third interval ; and that in the

mean time determinations similar to those at Kew, and equally satisfactory,

may be made in other parts of the British Islands ; the present conclusions

regarding the secular change of the force in the interval between 1837 and

1860 must be necessarily imperfect.

Plate X. exhibits a comparative view of the isogonic lines, or lines of

equal magnetic declination, corresponding to the epochs 1837 and 1857.

The lines corresponding to the first of these epochs have been drawn in con-

formity with a map of the isogonic lines crossing the British Islands in 1840,

published in plate 23 of ' Johnston's Physical Atlas ' (2nd edition), contributed

to that work by Major-General Sabine. The authorities on which the lines

for 1840 were drawn may be found in a memoir in the Philosophical

Transactions for 1849, art. xii. The small corrections required to reduce

these lines to the epoch of 1837 have been made.

The isogonics corresponding to the later epoch (1857) rest on the autho-

rity of the observations contained in the subjoined Table (No. XVL). The

instruments chiefly used were either the Admiralty Standard Compass, or

Kater's Azimuth Compass ; all of which had undergone previous examina-

tion and adjustment at the Compass Observatory at Woolwich.

Interim Report of the Committee for Dredging on the North and East

                                             Coasts of Scotland.

At tlie Aberdeen INIeeting of the British Association, a Committee vas ap-

pointed for the purpose of carrying on a system of dredging on the Nortli-

eastern Coast of Scotland, consisting of Dr. Ogilvie, Dr. Dickie, Professor

Kicol, Dr. Dyce, and Mr. Peach ; and ^625 was granted for that purpose.

Of this sum £5 ^Yas allotted to Mr. Peach, to enable him to conduct investi-

gations at AVick.

In 1860 the few weeks available for dredging, before the meeting of the

Association in July, were so tempestuous and generally unfavourable, that no

part of the grant was expended ; but in the course of the autumn, a trial was
made off the coast of Banflshire. During the past summer, 1861, several

dredging expeditions were planned and completed off the Bay of Aberdeen

and adjacent coasts, none exceeding a distance of twelve miles from land.
   The Committee in Aberdeen considered it advisable to receive the aid of

others besides Mr. Peach, and to have trials made at points intermediate

between Aberdeen and Wick, in order to render the investigations as complete

as possible; and with this view the assistance of the Rev, W, Grigor, of

IMacduff, was asked, and readily accorded, a part of the grant being allotted

to him. They have also secured the cooperation of another zealous naturalist,

Mr. Dawson, of Cruden. This gentleman has just put at their disposal a

valuable and interesting report on the MoUusca of Cruden Bay ; but the

others have not yet had sufficient time to allow of any report ; and at Aber-

deen, the examination of the materials collected being still in progress, the

Committee are under the necessity of reserving the details for a further report.

The general results, however, have been such as to lead them to hope that the
sum of £25 will be granted for one year more, in order that the dredging
may be further carried on, and at greater depths and distances from land.

   No regular dredging has previously been conducted on this part of the

Scottish coast ; but the Committee have now the satisfaction of observing

that, owing mainly to the admission of parties of students of the University

to the dredging excursions, a feeling of interest has been awakened in the

pursuit, from which the best results may be anticipated, and there can be no

doubt that several ardent young men have thus been thoroughly trained in

carrying on such operations in the open sea.

   The Committee would urge these as reasons for a renewal of the grant,
that they may be thus enabled to procure materials for a complete report at

the meeting of the Association in 1862.

On the Resistance of Iron Plates to Statical Pressvre and the Force

   of Impact by Projectiles at Higli Velocities. By William Fair-

   bairn, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., ^c, President of the Association.

The discovery of the application of iron plates as a means of defence against

ordnance of great power and force are of recent date, and are attributable to
His present Majesty the Emperor of the Frencii. Since 1858 numerous
experiments have been made to test the quality of the iron, and to determine
the thickness of the plates employed for that purpose; but it is only of late
years that the value and importance of this description of defence has been
                                                  --;

ascertained as a covei'ing for the sides of shrps of war. The very powerful

resistance of iron to projectiles at high velocities has directed most of the
maritime powers of Europe to the advantage of armour-plating ships for the
purpose of protecting them from the destructive effects of shot ; and it has

uow been proved that a sheathing of plates 4| inches thick, covering the

sides of a ship, extending to a depth of six feet below the water-line, is a
sufficient protection against existing guns of the heaviest calibre. It is true

that more powerful ordnance may be successfully tried against plates from

6 to 02 inches thick, but they are too heavy for general use on board ship
and as vessels of the present tonnage are not calculated to carry plates of
greater thickness than 4g or 5 inches, it is more than probable that the
country must be content with such protection as plates of these dimensions

can afford.

   Much, however, depends on the quality of the material of which they are
composed ; and the object of this communication is to furnish not only data
for the manufacture of them, but to point out their mechanical properties
and the best mode of attaching them to the ship.

   There are two descriptions of vessels to which armour-plates may be applied,

namely, those of iron, and the present existing vessels, composed entirely of
wood. In the present state of our knowledge, it is desirable that all vessels
of war should be formed of iron ; but the transfer is a work of time, and the

question now for consideration is, how to make our present wooden ships invul-
nerable, and how to apply the material to effect a maximum power of resistance

to shot. This is the great question for solution, and the Admiralty, fully alive
to the importance of the change, has instituted a long and laborious series

of experiments to determine these results.

   It is well known that all substances of a brittle nature are easily broken
by impact, and the best kind for resisting blows is a tenacious, tough, and
ductile material. To secure all these properties is a desideratum in the

manufacture of iron plates, and one which never ought to be neglected. In

submitting the following results obtained from the experiments, it may be
interesting to show the chemical compositions of some of the best irons ex-
perimented upon, and those marked with the letters A, B, C, and D, when

carefully analysed, were found to contain the following ingredients :

different aspect when suddenly snapped asunder by vibration or a sharp
blow from a shot. In the former case the fibre is elongated by bending,
arid becomes developed in the shape of threads as fine as silk, whilst in the

latter the fibres are broken short and exhibit a decidedly crystalline fracture.
But, in fact, every description of iron is crystalline in the first instance; and
these crystals, by every succeeding process of hammering, rolling, &c.,
become elongated, and resolve themselves into fibres. There is, therefore,

a wide difference in the appearance of the fracture of iron when broken by
tearing and bending, and when broken by impact, where time is not an ele-

ment in the force producing rupture.
   The mechanical properties of iron best calculated to resist the penetration

of shot at high velocities are enumerated as follows.

   The plates were subjected to statical tensile strain, to compression, and to

punching, with the following results.

                   1. Specific Gravity.

The mean specific gravity of the 1|, 2, 2|, and 3-inch plates of each series

were as follows :

                   A plates               7-8083

                   B plates               7-7035

                   C plates               7'904-2

                   D plates               7-6322

   The order of merit is therefore C, A, B, D. These results coincide with

the following tests.

                   2. Tensile Strength.

The statical resistance to tensile strain was as follows :

                                  Tensile strain per square inch in tons.

                                  18-333           24-171

   The general order of merit in this case is C, A, B, D. The homogeneous

metal plates have the highest tenacity, but decrease in strength progressively
as the plates increase in thickness.

                   3. Ductility of the Plates.

A measure of the ductility of the plates ia afforded by the ultimate

elongation under tensile strain.

   Here the order of merit is nearly the same as that for density and tenacity.

On the whole the elongations increase progressively with the thickness for

iron plates, and decrease for homogeneous metal plates. But with iron the
ductility is nearly the same for 2, 2g, and 3-inch plates.

                                        4. Resistance to Impact.

Mr. Mallet has pointed out that the product of the tensile breaking weight

and the ultimate elongation of iron indicates its resistance; or, in other words,
the product of the tenacity and ductility of iron affords a measure of the

dynamic resistance of the material, or its resistance to impact. The following

--numbers give this coefficient of rupture :

                                   Mallet's coefficient in foot pounds.

D plates                                    493 5115

To ascertain this coefficient with accuracy, rather longer specimens should

have been tested ; but, bearing in mind this source of inaccuracy, the numbers

strikingly correspond with the results obtained by impact. It is not of much

use to compare directly the resistances obtained with those givenabove, because

the former were made with such large intervals (half- inch) in the thickness

of the plates that they afford no criterion of the relative values of the dif-

ferent descriptions of iron. But we may compare the iron and steel plates,

where the difference of resistance, being greater, is to some extent indicated

in the experiments with ordnance.

   With these results obtained by simple pressure, we compare those obtained
by ordnance. The resistance of the iron plates being again taken as unity,

the resistance of the steel plates was as follows:

From the above it will be seen that there is quite as close an approximation

in the ratios in these two tables, for corresponding thicknesses of plate, as

could be expected from the nature of the experiments. Both the series of

experiments (viz., that with dead pressure and that with ordnance) indicate

the same increasing resistance of the iron plates, and decreasing resistance of

the steel plates ; and the ratios of their relative resistances are nearly the

same. In making the comparison, the resistance to ordnance is assumed

--to be as the square of the thickness of the plates a law which will here-

after be demonstrated.

The relative values of the plates in resisting shot are, according to the ex-

periments with dead pressure, as follows :

             A plates                                   1000

             D plates

   These numbers are deduced from the results on the I5, 2, 2|, and 3-inch

plates. With 3-inch plates the iron is much stronger than the steel.

                                        5. Resistance to Compression.

   The results on compression have no direct bearing on the resistance to

projectiles ; it is not therefore necessary to give an abstract,

                                6. Statical Resistance to Punching.

    These experiments were arranged in three series -with a view to determine
the resistance to punching with different sizes of shot, with different thick-
nesses of plate, and with flat- and round-faced punches.

                            First Series of Experiments.

   In this series the punch was flat-faced, and in all respects similar to the
projectile of the wall-piece employed at Shoeburyness. The resistance of the

plates was as follows :

The shearing strain varied from 13 to 20 tons per square inch in the case
of iron, and from 21 and 23 tons with homogeneous metal.

In this case the shearing stress per square inch of section varied from 17

to 19| tons in the case of iron, and from 18g to 27 tons in the homogeneous

metal.

In both these series the plates stand in the same order of merit, which is

also identical with that in whicii they were placed as regards tenacity and

density, viz., C, A, B, D. Their relative value is as follows :

         Third Series of Experiments.

   In this series a punch of the same diameter as the bullet of the wall-piece
was employed, but it was round-faced, like the cast-iron service shot. The

same die was employed, the object being to determine the difference of pene-

trating poAver of round- and flat-faced projectiles. In the following table the

resistances are given, and those of the flat-faced punch of the first series are

placed beside them, for comparison.

   These figures show that the statical pressure required to punch plates of the
same thicknessis about the same, whether the punch be round- or flat-faced.

   It is further shown in a detailed manner that, for the same pressure, the
volume displaced by indentation is the same for flat- and round-faced punches.

   Thence it follows that, where the plate does not exceed in thickness the
diameter of the punch, the depth of indentation is much greater with round-

than with flat-faced punches.

   And lastly, since the dynamic resistance which corresponds with thei'esist-

ance to projectiles, varies as the product of the statical pressure and the depth
of indentation, it thence follows that the dynamic resistance to round-faced

projectiles is much greater than the resistance to flat-faced projectiles.
   The general laws indicated in these experiments are as follows :

  --1. Size of shot or punch. The resistance varies directly as the circum-

ference of the shot.

  --2. Statical resistance of plates of different thickness. With plates of

different thickness the statical resistance varies directly as the thickness. If

--the thicknesses be as 1, 2, 3, &c., the resistances will be as 1, 2, 3, &c.
    3. Indeyitation. The ultimate indentation can only be approximately ob-

tained during experiments on punching; it varies directly as the thickness

of the plates. For flat-faced punches we may assume it to be one-half the

thickness, and for round-faced punches the whole thickness of the plate,
when the thickness of the plates is less than the diameter of the shot.

  --4. Dynamic resistance, or resistance to projectiles. The dynamic resistance

varies as the product of the statical resistance and the ultimate indentation
 of the plates. But both these quantities vary nearly as the thickness of the
plates, directly. Hence the dynamic resistance varies in a ratio which is
 nearly that of the squares of the thicknesses of the plates. So that if the
 thicknesses be as 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., the dynamic resistances will be as 1, 4, 9, 16,

 &c. And the dynamic resistances will be nearly twice as great for round-

 as for flat-faced projectiles.

  7. Computation of a general Formula for the Resistance of Iron Plates to

   Assuming the laws stated above as the result of the experiments on punch-
ing, the following formula has been deduced by equating the dynamic re-
sistance to the work accumulated in the shot.

   From the first of these formulas we can find the greatest thickness which
will be penetrated by a shot of a given size and at a known velocity. From
the second we obtain the coordinate values of the weight and size of the shot
necessary to punch a plate of a given thickness. The formulae are only

approximate, but they are as accurate as is necessary until the velocity of the
shot at impact has been more closely ascertained. It will then be time to
determine what modification is necessary to secure an entire agreement with

the experimental results. It may be stated, however, that the formulae do

not apply to those cases in which brittle plates break up by transverse flexure.
    As respects the fastening of armour-plates, the Committee on Iron have

been inundated with schemes from all quarters, but none of them have as
yet met the requirements of the case; and until further experiments are tried
to equalise the resistance of the fastenings to the resistance of the plates, we
are unable to look forward to anything approaching satisfactory results. Bolts
and nuts have been tried, and found defective. Strong countersunk rivets
have been used, with better success when the plates are attached without
wood or any other intervening substance to the skin of the ship ; but even
these have been found defective, and are inadmissible when a lining of oak or

teak intervenes between the armour-plates and the sides of the ship. An

ingenious contrivance has been recommended by Mr. Scott Russell for
attaching the armour-plates to the ship, and that is a series of bars, in the
form of the letter T^, along the sides of the vessel, between the joints of the
armour-plates and the web part a, projecting about an inch and a half beyond
the thickness of the plates, heated by a large blowpipe and riveted continu-
ously over the edge of each plate. This system of fastening answers well,
but can only apply to ships composed entirely of iron, and when the shield-
plates rest directly upon the sides of the ship. Extended experiments are
yet required to solve this difficult question, and we have every reason to
believe they will not be wanting, when other conditions connected with the
changes now in progress have been realized.

 Continuation of Report to determine the Effect of Vibratory Action and

    long-continued Changes of Load upon Wrovght-Iron Girders. By
   William Faibbaxrn, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S., ^c, President of the

     Association.

At the close of the Oxford Meeting it was announced that the experiments

on this important subject were still in progress, and that hopes were enter-
tained that they might be completed in time for the Manchester Meeting.

Confirmatory of that promise, we have now to submit the results of a still
more extended inquiry into the effects of vibratory action on molecular con-

struction. It will be in the recollection of the Meeting that, fifteen years
ago, experiments were made which led to the designs and construction of

the Conway and Britannia Tubular Bridges, on the Chester and Holyhead
                                                                                ;

Railways. Since that time some thousands of bridges have been built en-

tirely of wrought iron. The introduction of a new material, and the uncer-

tainty of its durability, led the Board of Trade to determine that the strain

should not exceed 5 tons per square inch on any part of the structure.

These requirements appeared to be founded on no fixed principle ; and the

bridge recently erected across the River Spey having been objected to as

not in accordance with this standard, it was resolved (with the consent and

at the expense of the Board of Trade) that the question whether the conti-

nuous changes of load, and the vibration by which they were accompanied,

did or did not lead to fracture. This was the question for solution ; and the

experiments now recorded have in a great measure determined to what extent

bridges of this kind can be loaded without incurring danger from fracture.

It is well known that the power of resistance to strain of wrought-iron

plates in combination depends upon the principle on which they are united

and unless the parts are permanently established, the five-ton tensile strain per

isquare inch might lead to error. For the purpose of ascertaining the effects

of the changes of load and vibration causing rupture, a small iron-plate beam

of 20 feet clear span, and 16 inches deep, representing the proportions of one

of the girders of the Spey Bridge, was constructed, and exposed to strains and

conditions similar to those produced by the passage of heavy trains over a

girder bridge.

The beam, as already described (page 46 of the Report of the Oxford

Meeting), was first loaded with one-fourth its breaking weight, and with this

load it sustained about one million changes without injury. The load was

then increased to nearly one-half the breaking weight, when it broke after
5175 changes. From this it appeared that bridges were not safe when loaded

to one-half the weight that would break them*. Having arrived at this
result, the beam was taken down and repaired, and the experiments renewed

with two-fifths the breaking weight, when 158 changes were made to bring

the parts repaired to their bearing. The load was then reduced from 4-6785

tons to 3-54 tons, when 25,900 changes were effected. After this the load

was again reduced to 3 tons, one-fourth the breaking weight, when 3,150,000

changes were recorded. Ultimately the load was increased to 4 tons, or

one-third the breaking weight, when it broke by tension across the botfcom

flange after sustaining 313,000 changes of that load.

In calculating the strain on the area of the metal after deducting the rivet-

holes, which, it must be remembered, were larger in proportion in the small

beam than in bridges full size, it was ascertained that the beam suffered no

deterioration with strains of 7^ tons per square inch ; but with 10 tons it

broke with only 51 72 changes, as may be seen in the following Tables of ex-

periments.      --Table IV. Beam repaired.

   The beam broken in the preceding experiment was repaired by replacing

the broken angle-iron on each side, and putting a patch over the broken

--plate equal in area to the plate itself. Thus repaired, a weight of 3 tons was

placed on the beam equivalent to one-fourth of tiie breaking weight ; that is,

With this weight the experiments were continued as before.

    2. That such tribunal shall have power to decide on the granting of
patents, but it shall be open to inventors to renew their applications notwith-

standing previous refusal.

    3. That the said tribunal should be formed by a permanent and salaried
judge, assisted when necessary by the advice of scientific assessors, and that
its sittings should be public.

    4. That the same tribunal should have exclusive jurisdiction to try patent

causes, subject to a right of appeal.
    5. That the jurisdiction of such tribunal should be extended to the trial

of all questions of copyright and registration of design.
    6. That the scientific assessors for the trial of patent causes should be

five in number (to be chosen from a panel of thirty to be nominated by the
Commissioners of Patents), for the adjudication of facts, when deemed neces-
sary by the judge or demanded by either of the parties.

    7. That the right of appeal should be to a Court of the Exchequer Cham-
ber, with a final appeal to the House of Lords.

    8. That for the preliminary examination, the assessors (if the judge re-
quires their assistance) should be two in number, named by the Commis-
sioners of Patents from the existing panel ; the decision to rest with the

judge.

    9. That the Committee approve of the principle of compelling patentees
to grant licenses on terms to be fixed by arbitration, or in case the parties
shall not agree to such arbitration, then by the proposed tribunal or by ^n
arbitrator or arbitrators appointed by the said tribunal.

   It would be seen, Mr. Hey wood said, that the recommendations of the Com-

mittee were very important, as they proposed the appointment of a special

tribunal. He presumed the cost would be defrayed out of the £70,000 which

was annually realized by the granting of patents, after the law officers of the
Crown and other officials had received their fees ; but at the present time a
large proportion of this sum was, he believed, applied to the reduction of

the taxation of the country.

Resolutions passed at a meeting of the Committee of the Manchester Patent

   Law Reform Association, held on the 30th of August, 1861, the Mayor

    of Manchester in the chair. Communicated by N. S. Hughes.

    " That in consequence of very peculiar views propounded by certain per-
sons, that inventors have no claim to remuneration for their inventions, how-
ever good and useful ; that the value of an invention must not be considered
in reference to the benefit of the inventor, but its utility to the public; and

that the inventive genius of man does not require any stimulus nor deserve

 any reward. These novel doctrines, in connexion with the Meeting of the
 British Association and the Great Exhibition of next year, have caused the

Committee of the Manchester Patent Law Reform Association to reconsider

 the views and resolutions they have so often discussed and adopted at their
 numerous meetings since 1850. Without intending to justify the present

laws in all their details, knowing the many defects which this Committee
advocated previous to the alteration in the Patent Laws in 1852, but which,

 owing to the mischievous opinions of misdirected parties, were overthrown,
 and consequently remain to be remedied, they consider it their duty to record
 a few of the Resolutions extracted from the minutes of their proceedings,
 which have been discussed and considered in every shape and form, both in

committee and in public meetings assembled frequently in the Town Hall in

 this city :

    <' 1. That it is universally acknowledged that discoveries, inventions, and
THE LAW OF PATENTS.  291

improvements relating to mechanical and chemical science have very greatly
conduced to the civilization of mankind, the progress of commerce, and the

wealth of nations.

   "2. That the ingenuity of Englishmen especially has effected many valu-

able inventions and improvements in almost every department of science and
manufactures, whereby the commerce, wealth, and power of the British
dominions have been promoted to an extent unparalleled in the annals of
any other nation.

    "3. That in order to develope to the fullest extent the inventive talents of
our countrymen, every encouragement and security should be given to in-

ventors consistent with the public welfare.

    " 4. That the present very heavy expenses, loss of time, and other incon-
veniences, occasioned by the intricate routine or operation of passing through
a great number of useless forms to which the inventor is subjected in obtain-
ing letters patent, exhibit a tendency not calculated to encourage, but abso-
lutely to baffle and paralyze the efforts of a class so essential in maintaining
the commercial pre-eminence of this kingdom.

   "5. That for many of the most valuable discoveries and inventions, this

country js indebted to the expansive minds of operatives and individuals in

humble life, who are prevented from securing to themselves the advantages

of their inventions on account of the present expensive process of obtaining
protection by royal letters patent.

    " 6. That inventors should not, in obtaining patent right for their inven-

tions, be burdened with any more expenses than such as may be absolutely

necessary for the establishment and maintenance of one government office
and for publishing full particulars of all patents granted.

    " 7. That for want of an official record of patents easy of access to the

public, many patents are taken out for the same invention, to the serious loss

and discouragement of patentees and manufacturers.
    " 8. That the practice of allowing six months to specify the particulars of

inventions, for which letters patent have been granted, operates very injuri-
ously both to patentees and the public, is a source of constant annoyance to

persons contemplating patents for inventions, and gives rise to much useless,

frivolous, and expensive litigation.
    " 9. That the present state of the law involves an expensive, dilatory, in-

convenient and uncertain mode of obtaining redress in cases of infringement

of patent right ; that the Judges of the land have been frequently at variance
in their decisions, and that juries are seldom found qualified to understand
the matters in dispute.

    " 10. That Commissioners be substituted for the law officers of the Crown,
to consist of one person eminently conversant with mechanics, and one con-
versant with chemistry ; the third, in order to form a quorum, to be a bar-
rister, or, if necessary, one of the law officers.

    "11. That the juries to try patent cases shall be scientific men, conversant
with the subject in dispute.

    " It will be seen from the above extracts that some of the suggestions were

embodied in the Patent Law Amendment Act of 1852, viz. a very great re-

duction in the cost of obtaining letters patent, a simplification of the process
of application, and the publication of all specifications recorded, forming one

of the most complete libraries of invention and scientific progress extant;
but still this Committee is well aware that further improvements are neces-
sary ; and, in considering such further improvements, the interests of the
public and the inventor must be taken jointly, and not separately."

                                                                     '

--Report on the Theory of Numbers. Part III. ByU. J. Stephem

    sity of Oxford.

              (B) Theory of Homogeneous Forms.

-- A79. Problem of the Representation of Numbers.  rational and integral

homogeneous function (a quantic according to tlie nomenclature introduced

by Mr. Cayley), of wliich the coefficients are integral numbers, is, in the

Theory of Numbers, termed a form (Disq. Arith. art. 266). The form

is linear, quadratic, cubic, biquadratic or quartic, quintic, &c., accord-

ing to its order in respect of the indeterminates it contains ; and binary,

ternary, quaternary, &c., according to the nnmber of its indeterminates.
+ + --Thus a;- -h?/- is a binary quadratic form, x^ ^f z^ Sxyz a ternary cubic

Aform.        form is considered to be given, when its coefficients are given

numbers; and a number is said to be represented by a given form, when

integral values are assigned to the indeterminates of the form, such that the

form acquires the value of the number. If the values of the indeterminates

are relatively prime, the representation is said to be primitive ; if they

admit any common divisor beside unity, it is a denved representation.

Thus 13 and 8 can be represented by x'+f; for 3' + 2^=13, 2- + 2'-=8;

and the first of these representations is primitive, the second is derived.

The fir^t general problem, then, that presents itself in this part of the

Theory of Numbers, is the following, "To find whether a given number

is or is not capable of representation by a given form, and, if it is, to find

all its representations by that form." The number of different representations

of a given number by a given form may be either finite or infinite ; in the

former case the complete solution of the problem of representation consists

in the actual exhibition of the different sets of values that can be given to

the indeterminates of the form: in the latter case it consists in assigning

general formula;, in which all those values are comprised. It is in either

case sufficient to consider primitive representations only ; for if the given

Nform/ be of order »n, and the given number be divisible by the m'* powers

in which the coefficients a.^ are integral numbers and the determinant is

different from zero*. This transformation we may, for brevity, describe as

the transformation \a\. When \a\ is a unit-transformation, i.e. when the

determinant of |a is a positive or negative unit, the inverse transformation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

transformation |T|, of which the constituents are defined by the equation

The transformation |T| is said to be conipomided o^ the transformations \a\

in general, convertible. When, in particular,yj is equivalent tof,,, and f^ to

yf^, is equivalent toy^ ; i. e. forms which are equivalent to the same form

are equivalent to one another. All the forms, therefore, which are equivalent

to one and the same form, may be considered as forming a doss. All the

invariants of any two equivalent forms have the same values ; but it is
not true, conversely, that two forms which have the same invariants are
necessarily equivalent. Nevertheless it may be conjectured that all forms

of the same sort (i. e. of the same degree, and the same number of indeter-

minates), the invariants of which have the same values, distribute themselves

into a finite number of classes ; and this conjectural proposition is certainly

true for binary forms of all orders, and for quadratic forms of any number of
indeterminates. It is readily seen that if a number be capable of representa-

tion by one of two equivalent forms, it is also capable of representation by

the other; and that the number of representations is either finite for both, or
infinite for both, and, if finite, is the same for eacli. The general problem,

therefore, of the representation of numbers (which we have already enunci-
ated) suggests naturally tiie following, which we may terni that of the
equivalence of forms: "Given two forms (of the same sort), of which the

invariants have equal values, to find whether they are, or are not, equivalent,

and if they are, to assign all the transformations of either of them, into the

other." The number of transformations may be either finite or infinite ; if

finite, the transformations themselves, if infinite, general formulae containing

them, are required for the complete solution of the problem.

  yWhen is not equivalent to, but contains y, the invariants ofy are

derived from those ofy by multiplication with certain powers of the

ymodulus (i, e. of the determinant) of the transformation by which is

changed intoy ; viz. if I be an invariant ofy, and if e and ?« be the orders

                                                                                                                         mi

of I, and ofy ory, the corresponding invariant ofy is a " I, a denoting

                                                                           mi

--the modulus of transformation, and the number being always integral.

This observation enables us to enunciate with precision a problem in which
the preceding is included : "Given two forms, of which the invariants have
values consistent with the supposition that one of them contains the other,
to find whether this supposition is true or not, and, if it is, to find all the
transformations of the one form into the other." But, in every case, the

solution of the problem in this more general form may be made to depend

on the solution of the problem of equivalence. For every transformation of
order n, and modulus «, arises, in one way and in one only, from the com-
position of two transformations |fl| and \v\, of which the latter is a unit-

To determine, therefore, whether the form /"^ can be transformed into /^ by

the forms (p be equivalent tojf^,f^ will contain/'^, and all its transformations

have been determined. This is tiie method proposed by Gauss for binary qua-

dratic forms (Disq. Arith. arts.213, 21 4) ; it is evidently of universal application

but the following modification of it possesses a certain advantage. Instead of

=representing |T| by the formula |T| |a|x|vl, we may employ the formula
 =Tl |z; X |a], in which |t;| is a unit-transformation as before, and la|i9

                                                                           1

one of the transformations included in the formula (C), where, however, the

inequality 0<^; </Xj is to be replaced by 0<A- ·<"·; the transformations

thus defined we shall call the transformations (C). If we now apply toy^

the inverse of each transformation included in (C), we shall obtain a

series of forms (p^, (p^, (p^         of which the coefficients will not necessarily

be integral numbers, because the coefficients of the inverse transformations

are not necessarily integral. If all the forms (p^, cp^,     be fractional, or if

none of those which are integral be equivalent toy,,yj cannot contain y;

but if some of them be integral, and equivalent to/^, it is plain that/, con-

tains y^, and that all the transformations of/, into/ may be obtained by
means of the transformations of/, into those forms (p which are equivalent
to it. The advantage above referred to consists in the circumstance that

the rejection of the fractional forms <p diminishes the number of the problems
of equivalence which must be solved to obtain the complete solution of the

--question proposed (compare Disq. Arith. art. 284, and note).
   81. Aiitomorphic Transformations The unit-transformations by which a

form passes into itself are the automorphics of the form ; thus 2,3 IS an

automorphic of a;^ Zy^. When every invariant of a form is zero, the form
may pass into itself by transformations of which the modulus is different

from unity; for example, x^--^xy+'^^y^, a binary quadratic form of which

the discriminant is zero, passes into itself by the transformation 3,2 of
                                                                                                      1,2

which the modulus is 4. In like manner it is to be observed that when two
forms of the same sort have all their invariants equal to zero, it may happen
that each of them passes into the other by transformations of which the
modulus is not a unit. But in this Report we shall have no occasion to

consider these exceptional cases, whether of equivalence or of automorphism,

and we shall therefore employ these terms with reference to unit-transforma-

tions exclusively. If T, and T^ be automorphics of a form/ T, x T,

of an automorphic is also an automorphic. (Tlie positive powers of a trans-

formation are, of course, the transformations wliicli arise from compounding

it continually with itself; its negative powers are the positive powers of its

inverse. See Mr. Cayley's Memoir on the Theory of Matrices, Phil. Trans,

vol. cxlviii. p. 17.) Hence, if a form have a single automorphic, of which no
two powers are identical, it will have an infinite number of automorphics.

The importance of automorphic transformations in the solution of the

problems of equivalence and transformation will be apparent from the

following considerations. If/" and/^ be two equivalent forms, \h\a. given

transformation of/j into/o, | ^i | and ja^j the general formulas representing

all the automorphics of/j and /^ respectively, all the transformations of

to be represented by/ ; and the representation is proper or improper accord-

than the second, to find whether the second can be represented (properly or

improperly) by the first, and, if it can, to assign all the representations of

which it is susceptible." If the second form contain only one indeterminate

(i.e. if it be an expression of the form Ax"), the problem reduces itself to

Athat of the representation of the number by the form/;. If, again,/, contains

as many indeterminates as/, the problem becomes that of the transformation

of/ into/. We may add that the problem of improper representation may

be made to depend on that of proper representation, by methods analogous
to those by which the problem of transformation depends on that of equiva-
lence. (See Disq. Arith. art. 284, where Gauss treats of the improper re-

presentation of binary by ternarj' quadratic forms.)
    83. It is hardly necessary to state that what has been done towards obtaining

a complete solution of these problems is but very little compared with what
remains to be done. Our knowledge of the algebra of homogeneous forms (not-
withstanding the accessions which it has received in recent times) is far too
incomplete to enable us even to attempt a solutioo of them co-extensive with

their general expression. And even if our algebra were so far advanced as to

supply us with that knowledge of the invariants and other concomitants of
homogeneous forms which is an essential preliminary to an investigation of
their arithmetical properties, it is probable that this arithmetical investiga-
tion itself would present equal difficulties. The science, therefore, has as
yet had to confine itself to the study of particular sorts of forms; and of
these (excepting linear forms, and forms containing only one indeterminate)
the only sort of which our knowledge can be said to have any approach to
completeness are the binary quadratic forms, the first in order of simplicity,

as they doubtless are in importance. Of all other sorts of forms our know-

ledge, to say the least, is fragmentary.

  We shall arrange the researches of which we have now to speak in the

following order, according to the subjects to which they refer :

                    1. Binary Quadratic Forms.
                  2. Binary Cubic Forms.
                   3. Other Binary Forms.
                   4. Ternary Quadratic Forms.
                   5. Other Quadratic Forms.
                 6. Forms of order n decomposable into 7i linear factors.

   The theory of linear forms (i. e. of linear indeterminate equations) we shall
refer to hereafter. That of forms containing only one indeterminate will

not require any further notice.

                                 (1) Binary Quadratic Forms.

   84. Instead of confining our attention exclusively to the most recent

researches in the Theory of Quadratic Forms, we propose, in the following

articles, to give a brief but systematic resume of the theory itself, as it
appears in the Disq. Arith., introducing, in their proper places, notices, as
full as our limits will admit, of the results obtained by later mathematicians.

We adopt this method, partly to render the later researches themselves more

easily intelligible, by showing their connexion with the M'hole theory ; but
partly also in the hope of facilitating to some persons the study of the Fifth
Section of the Disq. Arith., which, probably owing to the obscurity of

certain parts of it, is even now too much neglected by mathematicians.

This section is composed, as Lejeune Dirichlet has observed (Crelle, vol. xix.

p. 325), of two very distinct parts. The results contained in the former of
the two (arts. 153-222) are lor the most part those which had been already
obtained by Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre ; but they are completed in
many respects ; they are derived, in part at least, from different principles,

and are expressed in a terminology which has been adopted by most sub-
sequent writers. The second part (arts. 223-307) is occupied, after some

preliminary disquisitions (arts. 223-233), with the ulterior researches of

WeGauss himself.                          proceed then to give a summary of the definitions and

theorems contained in the first of these two portions.

 -- + +85. Elementary Definitions. The quadratic form ax^ ^bxy cy"^ is

symbolized by the formula (a, h, c) (x, yf, or, when it is not necessary to
specify the indeterminates, by the simpler formula (a, b, c). The second

coefficient is always supposed to be even ; and an expression of the form

+px- qxy-\-ry" (in which q is uneven) is not considered by Gauss as itself a

quadratic form, but as the half of the quadratic form (2p, q, 1r). The
F--acdiscriminant
                                          of the form (a, b, c) is called by Gauss the determinant

of  the  form                         an  expression  which  at  the  present  time  it would  be  neither
                                   ;

possible nor desirable to alter. When two forms are equivalent, they are

said to he properly equivalent if the modulus of transformation is +J, but

improperly equivalent if it is --1. Only those forms which are properly

equivalent to one another are considered to belong to the same class ; two
forms which are only improperly equivalent are said to belong to opposite

classes. This distinction between proper and improper equivalence is due to
Gauss, and is of very great importance. In what follows, unless the con-
trary is expressly specified, we shall use the terms equivalence and auto-
morphism to denote proper equivalence and proper automorphism. It is readily

seen that the greatest common divisors of «, 26, c, and of a, b, c are the same

for (a, b, c) and for every form equivalent to («, b, c) ; if each of those greatest

common divisors is unity, (a,b,c) is a properly primitive form, and the class

of forms equivalent to {a, b, c) a properly primitive class ; if the first greatest

common divisor be 2, and the second 1, the form, and the class of forms

equivalent to it, are termed improperly primitive. Every form which is not

itself primitive, is a numerical multiple of some primitive form of a less de-

terminant, and is therefore called a derived form. Thus x"+Sy' is a pro-

+perly primitive form of det.-- 3, 2x"-\-2xy 2y' is an improperly primitive
+ +form of the same determinant ; while 2x'^ 6y^, 4*^ -j- 4x2/ 4^^ are derived

--forms of det. 12.

    In all questions relating to the representation of numbers, or the equiva-

lence of forms, it is sufficient to consider primitive forms, as the solution of

these problems for derived forms is immediately deducible from their solution

for primitive forms ; but in certain investigations connected with the trans-

formation of forms the consideration of derived forms is indispensable. (The

problem of art. 82 coincides with that of the representation of numbers, in the

case of binary forms of any order.)

    The nature of the quadratic form («, b, c) depends very mainly on the

value of its determinant, which we shall symbolize by D. (1) If D=0, the
form (a, b, c) reduces itself to an expression of the type m(px+qyy,

mp and q denoting two numbers relatively prime, and                                  being the greatest

common divisor of a, b, c. The arithmetical theory of such expressions,

which are not binary forms at all, since they are adequately represented by

a formula such as wX", is so simple, and at the same time diverges so much

from that of true binary quadratic forms, that we shall not advert to it

again in this Report, and in all that follows the determinant is supposed to

Dbe different from zero. (2) When is a perfect positive square, the form

+ +(a, b,c) reduces itself to an expression of the type m(p^x q^y) {pj: qoy),

i. e. it becomes a product of two linear forms. Owing to this circum-

stance the theory of forms of a square determinant is so much simpler

than that of other quadratic forms, that we shall not enter into any details
                                                                 --j

with regard to them, though it is not necessary to exclude them (as is the

case with forms of determinant zero) from those investigations which

relate simultaneously to the two remaining kinds of quadratic forms; viz.

(3) those of a negative determinant, and (4) those of a positive and not

square determinant. An essential difference between these two kinds of

forms is, that whereas both positive and negative numbers can be represented

by any form of positive and not square determinant, forms of a negative deter-

minant can represent either positive numbers only, or negative numbers only.

+For if the roots of a+269+c9^=0 be real, it is clear that ax^ 2bxy -\- cif

will have values of different signs, when the ratio y : x falls between the two

roots and when it falls outside them ; but if the roots be imaginary, the form

will always obtain values having the same sign (viz. that of a or c), whatever

the ratio y : x may be. If (a, b, c) be a positive form (i. e. a form repre-
D=--senting positive numbers only) of a negative determinant
                                                                 A,

(_a, _6, _c) is a negative form of the same determinant, and can repre-

Wesent negative numbers only.  see, therefore, that there are as many

positive as negative classes for any negative determinant; and as everything

that can be said about positive forms or classes may be transferred at once,

mutatis mutandis, to negative forms and classes, we shall in what follows

exclude the latter from consideration, and, when we are speaking of forms of

a negative determinant, confine ourselves to the positive forms.

  --Sincea;^ D3/^or(l, 0,-- D),is a form of determinant D, we see that one class

at least of properly primitive forms exists for every determinant ; and the class

--containing the form x'^ Dy^ is called the principal class. Improperly pri-

mitive forms only exist for those determinants which satisfy the condition

D=l, mod 4 ; since, if (a, b, c) be improperly primitive, we have b~l, mod 2,

a^c^O, mod 2. But for every determinant satisfying this condition, one

class at least of improperly primitive forms exists; for (2, 1,  --- IS an

improperly primitive form of determinant D, and the class containing it may

be called the principal class of improperly primitive forms.

 --86. Reduction of the Problem of Representation to that of Equivalence.

The problem of the representation of numbers depends, first, on the solution

of a quadratic congruence, and, secondly, on the solution of a problem of
equivalence. This dependence is established by the two following theorems:

  M(i.) " When the number admits of a primitive representation by (a, b, c),

--the quadratic congruence a.' D=0, mod M, is resoluble."

   For if am'^-H26m«+cw^=M be a primitive representation of M, let fx, v be
two numbers satisfying the equation mv--nfi=^V ; we then find

  + + --(am^-\-2bmn+en'){aii'- 2biiv cv'') (amix-\-b[mv+nii']-\-cnvy--'D-,

or ii'^=D, mod M; i^ Q.-=amii-\-b{mv+nfi'\+cnv.

We have already referred to this result in art. 68.

  + MThe representation am"^ -'r2bmn cn- of the number by the form (a, b, c),

is said by Gauss to appertain to the value Q, of the congruential radical

 v/D, mod M. To understand this definition with precision, it is to be
observed that if in the expression of Q, we replace /i and y by any two other

--numbers satisfying the equation my n/x^l, the new value of ii will be of

the forra^-1-AM; and conversely, values for n and v can always be found

+which shall give to amfi-{-b\_mv n^'] +cni' any assigned value of the form

+ MOi kM. Two different representations of appertaining to the same value

of \/D, mod M, are said to belong to the same set.

taining to the value £i of VD, mod M, the two forms (a, b, c) and

Mare equivalent; and conversely, if these two forms are equivalent, admits

of a primitive representation by (a,b,c) appertaining to the value £i of

-/D, mod M."
   To establish the first part of this theorem, we observe that the assertion

Mthat admits of a primitive representation by the form (a, b, c) appertaining

to the value £i of \/D, mod M, implies the existence of four numbers

m, n, fi, V, satisfying the equations

taining to the value 0, of VD, mod M.

If (A, B, C) be a form equivalent to a form (a, b, c) by which

MTwo such representations of by equivalent forms are called corresponding
Mrepresentations ; and we may enunciate the theorem, " Corresponding repre-

sentations of the same number by equivalent forms appertain to the same

value of the expression VD> mod M," the truth of which is evident from the

respect of m, n and }i, v) to Ax^ -\-2^xy -\- Cy".

   To obtain, therefore, all the primitive representations of a given number

by a given form (a, b, c), we investigate all the values of ihe expression >JT>,

  --87. Determination of the number of Sets of Representations. It appears

from what has preceded, that if S denote a system of representative forms of

Ddeterminant (i. e. a system of forms containing one form, and only one, for

every class of forms of determinant D), the number of different sets of pri-
Mmitive representations of
                             by the forms of S is equal to the number of

differenb solutions of the congruence .r-^D, mod M. If, in particular,
M Mbe uneven and prime to D, it is clear that
                                                      can only be represented

by properly primitive forms; and in this case the number of solutions of

the congruence ,r'-^D, mod M, i.e. the number of sets of primitive re-
Mpresentations of
                   by the properly primitive forms contained in S, is

expressed by either of the two formulae n|l +(--)), or ^fy)' '° which

p Mand S denote respectively the prime divisors of M, and those divisors of

which are divisible by no square; while |-- jand| -- J are the quadratic

symbols of Lagrange and Jacobi (see arts 16, 17,68,76). If /u denote the num-
ber of different primes dividing M, the common value of the two expressions

--II| 14-(-- Hand SJ -- k is Z** or zero, according as the condition | |= 1 is

satisfied by every prime divisor of M, or is not satisfied by one or more

Dof them. Wiien    is ^^1, mod 4, S will certainly contain improperly
2M Mprimitive forms ; and the unevenly even number
                                                         (where  is still sup-

posed prime to D) will admit of primitive representation only by the impro-

perly primitive forms contained in S (for if il denote any root of the con-
                                                      ~

                                                         even, and the form

|M, il, -~  ~     will be improperly primitive). And the number of seta of

Mthe same as the number of sets of primitive representations of by the pro-

perly primitive forms in S.

depends on that of finding the primitive representations of a given number

Mby a given form (see art. 79). Two derived representations of are said to

belong to the same set, when the greatest common divisor of the indetermi-

nates, which we will symbolize by w, is the same for each, and when the two

--primitive representations of ;, from which they are derived, appertain to

the same value of y/D, mod --,,. Adopting this definition, we may enunciate

Mthe theorem, "If be an uneven number prime to D, the whole number of

We Mmay add that, as before, will be represented only by properly primi-

2Mtive forms ; and, when D^l, mod 4,                                                                                 only by improperly primitive

forms*.

   88. Reduction of the Problem of Transformation to that of Equivalence.--
It has been shown in art. 80, that the general problem, " Given two forms of

unequal determinants, to decide whether one of them contains the other,

and if so, to find all the transformations of the containing into the contained

form," can be reduced to the simpler problem of the equivalence of forms.

For the sake of clearness we shall here point out how the first of the two

general methods of that article is to be applied to quadratic forms. If of

two forms/ and F the former contain the latter, the determinant of F is a

multiple of that of/ by a square number, viz. by the square of the modu-

lus of transformation. Let the determinant of/ be D, and that of F, De"

malso let and ^i be any two conjugate divisors of e, so that m^=e. Then

every transformation of which the modulus is e may be expressed in one way,

                                           m,k                                                                                in which k denotes one of the

and one only, by the formula                                                                                         y, I

                                                                  0, IX

--numbers 0, 1, 2, 3,. . . .?«                                                                         I, and  a,/3  is any unit-transformation whatever.

                                                                                                               y, c

If, therefore, we apply to the form /all the transformations included in the

formula  m,k  (of which the number is equal to the sum of the divisors of c),

we shall obtain a series of forms <p,, (p.,,. ... of determinant De'. If none of
these forms be equivalent to F, F is certainly not contained in /; but if one

or more of them, for example, <p, arising from the transformation                                                    '

is equivalent to F, let  a,/3                                                                          represent indefinitely any transformation of (p

                         y,C
              0, jj.

the series which<p^, (p^,. . . . is equivalent to F, it is readily seen that the

transformations of/ into F, which are thus obtained, are all diflTerent, and

that they include all possible transformations of/ into F.

  We have supposed the number e to be positive, i.e. we have supposed

that/ contains F properly. To decide whether/ contains F improperly, we

have only to examine whether any of the forms f^, f^.... be improperly

equivalent to F ; and if any one of them be so, to combine the transforma-

tion of/ into it, with its (improper) transformations into F.

   89. Problem of Equivalence.-^lt remains to speak of the problem of

equivalence. Of the three parts of which this problem consists, viz. (1) to

decide whether two given forms are equivalent or not, (2) if they are, to

single transformation to deduce all the transformations, the last only admits

of being treated by a method equally applicable to forms of a positive and

Wenegative determinant.  shall therefore consider it first. The solution which

Gauss has given of it (Di<q. Arith. art. 162) depends on principles which

are concealed (as is frequently the case in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticas)

Weby the synthetical form in which he has expressed it.  shall not therefore

repeat the details of his solution, but shall endeavour to point out the basis

on which it rests.

Let/=(a, 6, c) {x,yy be transformed into F=(A, B, C) (a;, 2/)° by two

different, but similar transformations, ao>/3o and             t. e. by two

YJ =so that /(Xo, Y,,) =/(Xj,  F(r,?/) ; we have then the algebraical theorem

"The homogeneous functions V{x,y) and X^Yj-- XjY,, differ only by a

numerical factor, not containing x or y."

The truth of this theorem is independent of the supposition that the

coefficients of the given forms and given transformations are integral num-

bers. Its demonstration is implicitly contained in the formulae given by

Gauss ; or it may be verified more indirectly by the consideration, that if w

be a root of the equation a-\-2bw-\-cw'^=0, we have, simultaneously,

+£l denoting in each case the same root of the equation A 2Ba+Cn-=0, an

assertion which would not be true, if the equal determinants a,^^a~l^oya ^"^

Acular kinds of forms, change each factor into a multiple of the other.

of a negative, and then those of a positive and not square determinant.

conditions enunciated in the following Table, is called a reduced form. The

the special conditions. In every case, therefore, there exists one, and only

one, reduced form in each class.

   To obtain the reduced form equivalent to a given form, we form a series

of contiguous forms, beginning with the given form and ending with the

--303 iiEPOUT 1861.

   The theory of the reduction of quadratic forms was first given by Lagrange.
(See his ' Recherches d'Arithmetique' in the Nouveaux Memoires de I'Aca-

dcniie de Berlin for 1773 ; see also his Additions to Euler's Algebra, art. 32;

a memoir of Euler's, " De insigni promotione scientiae numeroruni," Opusc.
Anal. vol. ii. p. 273, or Comment. Arith. vol. ii. p. HO; Legendre, Theorie

des Nombres, premiere partie, sect. viii. ; Disq. Arith. arts. 171-173 ; M. Her-
mite in Crelle's Journal, vol. xli. p. 193.) The method is applicable to forms

of a positive, as well as to those of a negative determinant ; but when the

determinant is positive, the reduced forms are not, in general, all non-equi-

valent. When the determinant is negative, it is as applicable to forms, of

which the coefficients are any real quantities whatever, as to those of which

Wethe coefficients are integral numbers.  shall revert hereafter to the con-

sequences which M. Hermite has deduced from this important observation.

  We have now a complete solution of the problem of equivalence for forms

of a negative determinant. To decide whether two forms /j and/^ of the
same negative determinant are equivalent or not, we have only to investigate

the reduced forms 0, and (p.^ equivalent to/^ and/^ : according as f^ and (p^
are or are not identical, /; and f^ are or are not equivalent; and if they are
equivalent, all the transformations of/^ into/^ are obtained, by compounding

the reducing transformation of/^, first, with the automorphics of ^^j and then

·with the inverse of the reducing transformation off.,.

 --93. Problem of Equivalence for Forms of a Positive and not Square De-

terminant. The solution of the problem of equivalence for forms of a posi-

tive and not square determinant occupies a considerable space in the Disq.

Arith. (arts. 183-196). But, as I-ejeune Dirichlet has observed, in a

memoir which he has devoted to this problem (" Vereinfachung der Theorie

der binaren quadratischen Fornien," in the Memoirs of the Academy of

NewBerlin for 1851', or in Liouville,  Series, vol. ii. p. 353), the demonstra-

tions relating to it maj'^ be greatly abbreviated by employing certain known

results of the theory of continued fractions. The following method does not

differ materially from that proposed by Lejeune Dirichlet ; nor indeed is it,

in principle, very distinct from that of Gauss, the connexion of which with

the theory of continued fractions he has suppressed.

  We --shall suppose that the forms v.hich we consider are primitive

supposition which involves no loss of generality ; and we shall understand, in

what follows, by a " quadratic equation," an equation of the form

n, + 2b^0+a,0'=O,

--in which b^- «!,, a^ is positive, and a^, Z»,,, Oj are integral numbers without any

common divisor. Such a quadratic equation we shall symbolize by the formula

-- ^D[[ao,^^, ttj], and we shall regard the two quadratic equations [«o'^o'^i]'
[.--a,,,--b^, rtj] as different. If    denote the positive square root of

h^--Uf^a^, it is convenient to call

         -, and

a.

the first and second roots of [ao'^o'^il respectively; so that if we change
the sign of the equation throughout, we change at the same time the deno-

mination of the roots. Whenever therefore a root of a quadratic equation,

and the denomination of the root, are given, the quadratic equation itself is

AJgiven. Jt is readily seen that if two forms {a^^b^, aj, (A^, B,,,  be pro-

Jperly or improperly equivalent, so that "' ^ transforms (a^, b^, a into

i.e. those which are connected bv the relation w=i- --, are of the same,

or of opposite, denominations, according as the equivalence is proper or im-
proper. Let the first root of the equation [cr^,, 6^,, Cj] be developed in a
continued fraction, of which all the integral quotients are positive except

the first, which has the same sign as the root. In this process we obtain a
perfectly determinate series of transformed equations, each having a com-

plete quotient of the development for its first or second root, according as it
occupies an uneven or an even place in the series, counting from the pro-

posed equation inclusive. The complete quotients eventually form a period
of an even number of terms ; there exists therefore a corresponding period

of transformed quadratic equations, which will be of the type

ajjCao» /3o>  ^v[.a-v           ^2]' C*2' Z^^, a^'],     [a2fc-i' ?ik-v «o]'

Every equation of the period has one of its roots positive and greater than
unity, the other negative and less in absolute magnitude than unity ; and if

we suppose (as we shall do) that we begin the period with an equation

occupying an uneven place in the series of transformed equations, the positive
root of any equation of the period will be its first or second root, according

as it occupies an uneven or an even place in the period.

   To apply what has preceded to our present problem, we require the fol-
lowing lemma (see sect. 2 of Dirichlet's memoir, or M. Serret in Liouville,

vol. XV. p. 153).

   " If w and ii be two irrational quantities connected by the relation

+w=^iX----, where a, /3, y, ^ are integral and aS-- /3y= l, the develop-

ments of w and il in a continued fraction will ultimately coincide, and the

same quotient will occupy an even or an uneven place in both developments

--the other, if aS (^y'=- !·"

A quadratic form (»,,, ji^, a J of positive determinant, is said to be reduced*

reduced forms equivalent to any proposed form (a^,bg,aj can always be

ajfound. For, if the first root of la^, b^,  be developed in a continued frac-

tion, and if its period of equations (beginning with an equation occupying

an uneven place in the series of transformed equations) be represented as

ajbefore by [a,,, /3,,, aj, [a^, fi,,                 [aai-P f^2k-i> «»]> the forms

(a,, /3,,, aj, (a^, -/3,, a,),  (a^i-,, -l^^jc-v «o) ^iH be all reduced and

all equivalent to (a^, b^, aj. These forms, so deduced from the develop-

ment of the first root of the equation  cj[a,,, b^,   ,  we shall term the period of

forms equivalent to (a^, b^, a J, or, more briefly, the period of («,,, b^, a J. It
will be seen that each form of the period is contiguous to that which precedes

it, and that the first is contiguous to the last.

We can now obtain a complete solution of our problem. If («;,, &,,, Oj)
A J Ajand (Ag, B,,,
are equivalent, the first roots of [a^, bg,a^'] and [A,,, B,,,

will be corresponding roots, and the developments of these two roots will

ultimately coincide, giving one and the same period of complete quotients.

* These reduced forms are not to be confounded with the reduced forms of the last article.
310             REPORT 1861.

     ·

And, since the same complete quotient will occur in an even or in an un-

even place alike in each development, it will be a root of the same denomina-

tion in the quadratic equation determining it in each development. The

period of equations will therefore be precisely the same for each develop-

ment ; and the same equation may be taken as the first equation of each

AJperiod. Consequently the periods of (a,,, b^, aj, (A;,, B,,,  are identical.

Two forms therefore are or are not equivalent, according as their periods

are or are not identical. To obtain the transformations of aj(a^, b^, into

(Ao, B,,, Aj), when these two forms are equivalent, let the complete quotients

in the development of the aJfirst root of [a,,, b^, be Wp w^    , and let

--the convergent immediately preceding w,,+j be . Similarly, let ii,,^j and

-- be a complete quotient and a convergent in the development of the first

root of [ A(,, Bq, aj. Then, if w^=tiji (where /i^M, mod 2), all the trans-

AJformations of («(,, ip, Oj) into (A,,, Bq,           are comprised in the formula

It should be observed that a reduced form is always a form of its own

period. To prove this, we remark that reduced forms are of two kinds;

aJthey are either such as («,,, (i^, aJ, where the first root of [«,,, /S^,          is

-- --positive, or such as (aj, /3j, a^), where the first root of [a^, /S,, a,] is

negative. Now a reduced form such as (a^ j3^, a^) is evidently a form of

aJits own period, for the equation [a,,, /3,,,         is itself an equation of the

period in the development of its first root. And a reduced form such as

--(ttj, /3j, a^) is also a form of its own period. For if we develope the second

root of [a^, jSy a^], we obtain a period of equations of which [a^, /3i, a^J

is itself one. Let [a,, (i.^, a^'] be the equation immediately Ibllowing

aJ[aj, /3j, a^]                                        is an equation occupying an even
     in this period ;  then [a^,
                                                 /3i,

place in the period of equations arising from the development of the first
-- aJroot of [a^, ft^, a,^'], and consequently {a^, /3j,
                                                          is a form in the period of

(a^, jS^, a.^) ; i. e. it is a form in its own period, because it is equivalent to

(a,, fi,, a,).
   It follows from this that no reduced form can be equivalent to a given

form, unless it occur in the period of that form.

The inequalities satisfied by the roots of any equation of a period give

rise to certain inequalities which are satisfied by its coefficients. These in-

equalities (which are not all independent) are,

     (i) [aJ<2VD; [/3J<VD; K]<2VD.

     (ii) VD-[/3J<[aJ<:VD-F[/3J;

     (iii) VD-[/3J<CaJ<VD+[/3J.

The same inequalities are, of course, satisfied by the coefficients of a reduced
form ; its middle coefficient is, moreover, positive. And conversely, every
form whose middle coefficient is positive and whose coefficients satisfy these

inequalities is a reduced form.

ambiguous class contains ambiguous forms.

   To complete the theory of equivalence, we shall here briefly indicate the
solution of the problem, " To decide whether a given form is improperly

equivalent to itself or not, and if it is, to find its improper automorphics."

   When the determinant is negative, it follows from the principle that two re-

duced forms cannot be equivalent, that no reduced form, the opposite of which

is different from it and is also a reduced form, can be improperly equivalent
to itself. Hence the only reduced forms which have improper automorphics

=are those in which b=0, or 2b a, or a=c. In the two former cases the

reduced form is ambiguous, in the latter it has the improper automorphic

, * , , and is moreover contiguous and therefore equivalent to the am-

a--biguous form (2a-- 2b,  b, a). These considerations supply a sufficient

criterion for deciding whether a form of negative determinant is equivalent

to itself or not. If it is, its improper automorphics are given by the formula

|T|x| r |x|T|~' ; ITj denoting the reducing transformation of the given

form, and r any improper automorphic of the reduced form. For forms of a
                                                                                        ||

ceded by its own associate; so that the type of the period will be

(Po^ 9o^Pi)y (Pi^ QvPoJi · · · · (Pk-v %-vPk\

(Pk> %-vPk-l)' (Pk-V %-vPk-2\ · · · (Pl. ffo'i'o).

where for simplicity we have supposed that {p^, q^^p^ is one of the two
forms which is preceded by its associate; the other is (jt>;j, qi--i'> 2^k-\)-

These two forms are ambiguous, for it follows from the contiguity of each

Weform to that which precedes it, that 2«/,, ss 0, mod p^ ; 2gj_ j=:e 0, mod jfj^..

arrive therefore at the conclusion that the period of every ambiguous class

contains two ambiguous forms ; either of which enables us, as in the case of
forms of a negative determinant, to obtain all the improper automorphics of

any form of the class.

   Gauss has shown (Disq. Arith. art. 164), by an analysis which it is not

necessary to explain here, that ify contain F both properly and improperly,

an ambiguous form contained iny, and containing F, can always be assigned.
This theorem comprehends the result which we have incidentally obtained in

this article, that every ambiguous class contains ambiguous forms. (See also

Newa note by Dirichlet, in Liouville,  Series, vol. ii. p. 273.)

95. The important theorem, that for every positive or negative determi-

nant the number of classes is finite, is a consequence of the theory of reduc-

tion. To establish its truth, it is sufficient to employ the reduction of Lagrange

(art. 92), which is applicable to forms of a positive determinant having inte-

gral coefficients no less than to forms of a negative determinant, and which

Dshows that in every class of forms of determinant there exists one form at

least the coefficients of which satisfy the inequalities [26]<[a], [2/>]<[c].
D --These inequalities give, if be negative, ac^
                                       D, [^]-^V                  ; and if

                                       33

D be positive, [ac]<D, [5]<V_. The number of forms whose coeffi-
                                                        5

cients satisfy these inequalities is evidently limited; therefore, dfortiori,ihQ

number of non-equivalent classes is finite.
   To construct a system of representative forms of det. D, we have only to

Dwrite down all the forms of det. whose coefficients satisfy the preceding

inequalities, to which we may add [«]^[c]. If the determinant be

negative, it only remains to reject the forms which do not satisfy the special

conditions; if it be positive. Me must examine whether any of the forms
which we have written down are equivalent; and, if so, retaining only one
form out of each group of equivalent forms, we shall have the representative

system required.

  A few particular cases of the theory merit attention from their simplicity.

  D= --If Ij there is but one class of forms, represented by x'^-\-if ; and by

the theorems of arts. 87 and 90, the number of representations of any uneven
(or unevenly even) number by the form x°-\-if is the quadruple of the ex-

+cess of the number of its divisors of the form 4«. 1, above the number of its
+divisors of the form 4« 3. (See .Jacobi in Crelle's Journal, vol. xii. p. 169 ;

Dirichlet, ibid. vol. xxi. p. 3. In counting the solutions of the equation
ON THE THEORY OF NlJMBERS.  313

x^-V-y'^=^2p, Jacobi considers two solutions, such as x^-\-y^=-'ip and

x^-k-y^=1lh to be identical, when x^=x.^, y^=y.i\ the number of solu-
tions is thus a fourth part of the number of representations.) In particular

+every prime of the form4M l (and the double of every such prime) is

capable of decomposition in one way, and one only, into two squares relatively

prime ; and, conversely, every uneven number capable of such decomposition

in one way only is a prime of the form \n-\-\.

  D=--If 2, oo'^-\-2y^ represents the only class of forms; and every uneven

number can be represented by x-+2y', in twice as many ways as it has divi-

+ +sors of either of the forms 8?i 1, or 8w 3, in excess of divisors of the forms
+8?i+5, or 8w 7. (Dirichlet, loc. cit.) In particular every prime of either
+ +of the forms Sn 1 or 8n 3 is decomposable in one way, and in one only,

into a square and the double of a square.

  -- --Again, for each of the determinants 3 and 7, there is but one properly

and one improperly primitive class, which may be represented by the forms

(1,0, 3) and (2, 1,2); (1, 0, 7) and (2, 1, 4). Uneven numbers are there-

+fore represented by x- 3y~, in twice as many ways as they have divisors of
+ +the form 3?i l, in excess of divisors of the fotm 3n--l ; and by x^ 7y^ in

+twice as many ways as they have divisors of the forms 7« l, 2, 4, in excess

of divisors of the forms 7n-\-3, 5, 6. Similarly, x'^+iy'^ represents the only

--primitive class of det. 4.

For each of the eleven positive determinants of the first century 2, 5, 13,

17, 29, 41, 53, 61, 73, 89, 97, there is but one properly primitive class ; there

is also for the ten uneven determinants one improperly primitive class. Re-

presenting any one of these eleven numbers by D, by [T, U] the least solu-

-- Mtion of T^ DU^=1, and by Dan uneven positive number prime to we

may enunciate the theorem,

-- D?/=M"The equation x'    is capable of as many solutions in positive

< y^ UV^, Mnumbers x and y, satisfying the conditions a; TVM^>
                            as

Dhas divisors of which is a quadratic residue in excess of divisors of which

D is a quadratic non-residue."

  -- MThus the number of solutions of the equation x^ 2y'^M, where is an

uneven number, and 0<:a;<.3 s/ M, 0<y<2 VM, is the excess of the divisors

M + +of of the forms 8n l above its divisors of the fornis8« 3.

The conditions <:a;;^T V M, 0<y '^U V M, which are satisfied by one

representation, and only one, in each set, are obtained by considerations to

--which we shall hereafter refer (art. 100).
  96. The Pellian Equation. The two indeterminate equations, T^-- DU^=1

and T'^-- DU^=4, are, as we have seen, of primary importance in the theory
of quadratic forms of a positive and not square determinant. When the

complete solution of these equations is known, we can deduce, from a single

representation of a number by a form, every representation of the same set;

and, from a single transformation of either of two equivalent forms into the

other, every similar transformation. The same equations also present them-

selves in the solution in integral numbers of the general equation of the

second degree containing two indeterminates, and enable us in the principal

case in which it admits an infinite number of solutions to deduce them all

from a certain finite number. This fundamental importance of the equation

T^-- DU"=1 was first recognized by Euler, who has left several memoirs

relating to it (see Comment. Arith., vol. i. pp. 4, 316; vol. ii. p. 35; also

Euler's Algebra, vol. ii. cap. vii.) ; but the equation itself had already given

rise to a discussion which forms a well-known passage in the scientific history

of the seventeenth century. Its solution was proposed by Fermat (see the
                                                                          --

|14 BEPORT--1861.

Commercium Epistolicum of Wallls, Ep. 8) as a challenge to the English
mathematicians, and especially to Wallis. The problem was at first misunder-
stood by Lord Brouncker and Wallis, who each gave a method for its solution
in fractional numbers ; not attending to the restriction to integral numbers

implied, though not expressed, in Fermat's enunciation, without which the
problem is of a very elementary character. Ultimately, however, they ob-

tained a complete solution by a method, which Wallis describes in the Comm.

Epist. Epp. 17 (postscript) and 19, and in his Algebra, capp. xcviii. and xcix,,
attributing it to Lord Brouncker, though he seems himself to have had some
share in its invention. This method is the same as that which is given by
Euler in his Algebra, and in the first of the memoirs above cited, and which
is attributed by him to Pell *. It differs, in form at least, from that now em-
ployed, and was evidently suggested by the artifices of substitution employed
in Diophantine problems. It is most easily explained by an example. If

T*-- 13U^=1 be the equation proposed, the process would stand thus:

(1) 3U<T<4U; letT=3U-ft;, ; -4^W+6\Jv^+v^^=l,

(2) Vi<U<2«, ; }et\J=v^ + v^; ^v^--2v^v^--^v^^=l,

  (7)  v^<v,<2v^;          +\etv^=v^ v^;     --W^+2v\v^+'^v^''=\,

       v,<t;,<2Vg;         \etv^=v^+v^^;    ++--4^vi 2VgVg 3v^^=l,

                                              =v^''--6v^t\^--4:vj l.

  =In the last equation we may put Vg l, v^g=0 ; whence T=649, U=180.

It will be seen that the success of the method depends on its leading at last

to an equation in which the coefficient of one of the indeterminates is +1.

Wallis does not prove that such an equation will always occur ; and the de-

--monstration which he has given of the resolubilityof the equation T^ DU"=1

is inconclusive. (See his Algebra, cap. xcix. ; the reader will find the

paralogism which vitiates his reasoning in the proof of the lemma, upon which

it depends ; see also Lagrange's criticism in the 8th paragraph of the Additions

to Euler's Algebra ; and Gauss, Disq. Arith. art. 202, note.) It is evident that

the method of solution employed by Wallis really consists in the successive

                                                                            T

                           in a continued fraction. It is singular, however,

that it never seems to have occurred to him that, to complete the theory of

the problem, it was necessary to demonstrate that the equation is always re-

soluble, and that all its solutions are given by the development of VD. His

memoir (Comment. Arith. vol. i. p. 316) contains all the elements necessary

* There does not seem to be any ground for attributing either the problem or its solution

to PeU ; and it is possible that Euler may have been misled by a confused recollection of

the contents of Wallis's Algebra, in -which an account is given of the method employed by

DU"=Pell in solving Diophantine problems. Nevertheless the equation T^--  1 is often called

the Pellian equation after him, probably upon Euler's authority.

to the demonstration, but here, as in some other instances, Euler is satisfied

with an induction which does not amount to a rigorous proof. The first ad-

missible proof of the resolubility of the equation was given by Lagrange in

the Melanges de la Societe de Turin, vol. iv. p. 41. He there shows that in
the development of VD, we shall obtain an infinite number of solutions of
some equation of the form T'-- DU^=A, and that, by multiplying together

a sufficient number of these equations, we can deduce solutions of the equa-

tion T^-- DU^=1. But the simpler demonstration of its solubility, which is

now to be found in most books on algebra, and which depends on the com-

pletion of the theory (left unfinished by Euler) of the development of a
quadratic surd in a continued fraction, was first given by Lagrange in the
Hist, de I'Academie de Berlin for 1767 and 1768, vol. xxiii. p. 272, vol. xxiv.

p. 236; and, in a simpler form, in the Additions to Euler's Algebra, art. 37.

Lastly, Gauss, who in the Disq. Arith. avoids the use of continued fractions,
has shown that if we form by the method which he indicates, the period of
any quadratic form of det. D, we may infer the complete solution of the

Equation T"-- DU^=1, or =4', from the automorphics of any reduced form,

according as the form is properly or improperly primitive. (Disq. Arith. art.

198-202.)

   To express conveniently the principal theorems relating to these equations,
we employ the following notatioa *. The numerator of the continued

fraction

is called the cumulant of the numbers q^, q^, · · · q,,, and is represented by

the symbol {q^, q^, q^,. . .q,,) ; the denominator is evidently the cumulant

($'2' ^a' · · ^n)- Accents are sometimes employed to indicate that the first or

last quotient of a cumulant is to be omitted ; thus '(y^, q,,, q^, . . q )
= qj=(q,,q,, qj(q^, q,,... qj,
       q,,(q^,            q^, . . .             q^, . . q,,_^ ), '(q^, q^, . .

comprised in the formula [T3,,, Ua^], and consequently [J-Ts,!, iUs,.] will

  (vii.) The equations T^-DU-=-4, T--DU'=-1 are not resoluble for

   (viii.) The "Canon Pellianus" of Degen (Havniae 1817) contains a Table,

Dgiving for every not square value of less than 1000, the least solution of

the equation T--- DU-=1, together with the development of i\/T> in a. con-

tinued fraction. Its arrangement will be seen in the following specimens :--

the middle quotient, or the two middle quotients, after which the same quo-

tients recur in an inverse order. Thus,

   The numbers in the second row are the denominators of the complete
quotients ; i. e. taken alternately positively and negatively, they are the ex-
treme coefficients in the equations of the period. Thus the period of equa-
tions for V357is [--33, --18,1], [1,18, --33], [--33, -15,4], [4,17,
-17], [-17, --17,4], [4,15, --33]. The first half of the period of

--equations for V97is [ 16, --9,1], [1, +9, --16], [-16,-7,3], [3, 8,

-- -- -- ---11], [-11, -3, 8], [8, 5, -9], [-9, -4, 9], [9, +5, -8], [-8,
   3, 11], [11, 8, 3], [ 3, 7, 16], the second half being composed of
the same equations in the same order but with their signs changed. The

middle coefficients of the equations are not given in the Table ; but if

[axj /3a., ax+i], [aA.+ i, /3a.+i, 0,^+2'] be two consecutive equations, of which

the former determines the integral quotient yu^, they may be successively cal-

culated by the formula /3a+i=/'a. "i-^+i+I^K'

^Dconvergent to s/Y); so that a number less than       is or is not capable of

representation by the principal form of det. D, according as it is or is not in-

cluded among the numbers of the second row.

The second Table of the " Canon " contains the least solution of the equa-
-- DDU^=tion T^--
                    1 for those values of less than 1000 for which that equa-

tion is resoluble.

+form 8« 5 less than 1000, for which those equations are resoluble in uneven

numbers. This Table, as well as Degen's second Table, is implicitly con-

tained in the first Table of the " Canon," as appears from the theorem of

Lagrange just cited.

depends (as we shall hereafter see) on the number of classes of forms of det. D.

 --97. Solution of the General Indeterminate Equation of the second degree.

+ + +The solution of the indeterminate equation ax"^ 2bxy-\-cy'^ 2dx ley -\-f=-0

depends on the problem of the representation of a given number by a qua-

Wedratic form.  confine ourselves to the case which presents the greatest

complexity, that in which 6"-- ac=D is a positive and not square number.

The methods of solution contained in Euler's Memoirs relating to it (see

Comment. Arith. vol. i. pp. 4, 297, 549, 570, vol. ii. p. 263 ; and the Algebra,

vol. ii. cap. vi.) are incomplete in several respects: first, because Euler

always assumes that a single solution is known, and only proposes to deduce

all the solutions from it; secondly, because it is not possible, from a given

solution, to deduce any other solutions than those which belong to the same

set with the given solution, whereas the equation may admit of solutions be-

longing to different sets ; and lastly, because he gives no method for distin-

guishing between the integral and fractional values contained in the formulae

by which x and y are expressed. The first complete solution of the problem
was given by Lagrange in his Memoir " Sur la solution des Problemes Ind6-

terniines du second degre" (Hist, de I'Academie de Berlin for 1767, vol.

xxiii. p. 165-311). But the following method of solution, which is different

in some respects and much simpler, will be found in a subsequent memoir,

"Nouvelle methode pour resoudre les problemes iud6termines en nombres

appear that N=:
                         is necessarily integral, i. e. that flt is one of the roots of

-- Mthe congruence Si^ D;^0, mod ; and the equation will assume the form

N + +in succession. The development of either root of the equation

arts. 33-35.) Or again, if we apply the transformation of art. 92 to the

form (N, O, M), we obtain an equation of the typeRi'-4-2Qa;' ?/'-|-Ry-=l,

Mequations of similar form obtained by replacing

it leaves when divided by any one of its square divisors, we obtain a finite

number of formulae of the type

--[T, U] denoting any solution of the equation T^ DU^=1. These for-                      1

mulae are fractional ; but by attending to the principle of art. 96, v., we can

ascertain for each pair of formulas whether they contain any integral values
or not, and if they do contain any, we can substitute for the single pair of
fractional formulae a finite number of pairs not containing any fraction.

   The form in which the solution of this problem has been exhibited by
 jrauss is remarkable for its elegance. Let

X+p, B'ij=Y+q, we find aX- + 2bXY +cY^=B'A.'. If [X,,,Y,,J denote

indefinitely any representation of D'A' by (a, b, c), we have only to separate
(by Lagrange's method) those values of X,,, Y,, which satisfy the congruences
X.,,+p^O,Y"'+q^O, mod D', from those which do not, and we shall obtain
a finite number of formulae, exhibiting the complete solution required.

 --98. Distribution of Classes into Orders and Genera. The classes of

forms of any given positive or negative determinant D, are divided by
Gauss into Orders, and the classes belonging to each order into Genera.

Two classes, represented by the forms (a, b, c), («', b', c'), belong to the same
order, when the greatest common divisors of a, b, c and a, 25, c are respec-

tively equal to those of a\ b', c', and of a', 2b', c'. Thus the properly primi-
tive classes form an order by themselves ; and the improperly primitive
classes form another order. To obtain the subdivision of orders into genera,

it is only necessary to consider the primitive classes ; because we can deduce

the subdivision of a derived order of classes from the subdivision of the

the order of properly primitive classes depends on the principles contained in

mthe following equations, in which q is an uneven prime dividing D, and m}

formula (i.) expresses that

   All the formulae are deducible by the most elementary considerations from

follows from the law of quadratic reciprocity, that one-half of these complete

A comparison of these equations with the preceding Table will show that the

product of the particular characters which stand before the line of division

+1in the Table is equal to  in the case of any really existing genus; i.e. that

precisely one-half of the whole number of complete generic characters are

Weimpossible.   shall hereafter see that the remaining half of the generic

characters correspond to actually existing genera, and that each genus con-
tains an equal number of classes. That genus, every particular character of
which is a positive unit, is called the principal genus ; it evidently contains
the principal class, and is therefore, in every case, an actually existing
genus.

Since the extreme coefficients of a form are numbers represented by it,

and since, further, if the form be properly primitive, one or other of them is

prime to 2 and to any prime divisor of the determinant, we see that the

generic character of a form can always be ascertained by considering the

   Two forms, which have different generic chamcters, cannot be equivalent

nor can a number be represented by a form if its character is incompatible

with the generic character of the form. It is therefore convenient, in any

problem of equivalence or representation, to begin by comparing the generic

characters of the given forms with one another, or with the characters of the

given numbers.

bv forms belonging to that genus the character of which coincides with the
character of the number 0. It is clear that one half of tlie linear forms, in-

+cluded in the formula 2''PR 0, do not satisfy the condition of possibility in-

dicated in the Table, and are therefore incompatible with any quadratic form

Dof determinant ; while the remaining half of those linear forms will be

equally distributed among the actually existing genera; so that there will be
either'n^(p--l)j(r--'[)or2U^(p--l)^(r--l) linear forms proper to each
genus. But although no number contained in any one of the first-named
linear forms can be represented by a form of determinant D, yet it is not to

mbe inferred that every number contained in the other half of the linear

forms is capable of such representation ; for from the linear forio of m, we

_ mcan indeed infer the equation ( )= 1 ; but, if be not a prime, or at least

the product of a prime by a square, we cannot from this equation infer the
resolubility of the congruence i2^ 5s D, mod m, or of any congruence of the

forraii^^D, mod--. We may add- that if we assume the theorem that

every arithmetic progression, the terms of which are prime to their common

difference, contains prime numbers, the consideration of the case in which tn
is a prime establishes the actual existence of every genus the character of

which satisfies the condition of possibility. (Crelle, vol. xviii. p. 269.)

99. In the preceding articles we have briefly recapitulated the definitions

and principles which constitute the elements of the theory of quadratic forms.

We have hitherto followed closely the 5th section of the Disq. Arith. (arts.

153-222 and 223-233) ; but before we proceed to an examination of the re-

mainder of that section, it will be convenient to place before the reader an

account of the method employed by Lejeune Dirichlet in his great memoir,

" Recherches sur diverses applications de I'analyse infinitesimale a la theorie

des nombres," for the determination of the number of quadratic forms of a

given positive or negative determinant.

   * All the results of this article are given in the Disq. Arith. arts. 223-232 ; but as Gauss

does not employ the symbol of reciprocity, we have preferred to follow the notation of Di-

richlet. It is also to be noticed that Gauss does not use the law of quadratic reciprocity to

demonstrate the impossibility of one-half of the generic characters ; for, as we shall here-

after see, this impossibility is proved in the Disq. Arith. (art. 261) independently of the law
of reciprocity, and is then employed to establish that law. (Gauss's second demonstration,
see Disq. Arith. art. 262.) There is also an unimportant difference between Dirichlet and
Gauss with respect to the definition of the generic character of an improperly primitive form ;
for Gauss obtains the generic character (see art. 232) by considering the numbers repre-
sented by the form, and not the halves of those numbers. But he also observes (art. 227,
and 250, VI.) that each improperly primitive class is connected in a particular manner (to
which we shall again refer) with one or with three properly primitive classes ; and that this

consideration may be employed to divide the improperly primitive classes into genera. And

it will be found that the complete character which Dirichlet's definition attributes to an im-
properly piimitive form is, in fact, the complete character of the properly primitive class or

classes with wluch it is connected.

     It appears from the Additamenta to art. 306, X. of the Disq. Arlth., that
 Gauss, at the time of the publication of that work, had already succeeded in
 effecting this determination ; and the method by which lie effected it will at
length appear in the second volume of the complete edition of his works,

the publication of which is now promised by the Society of Gdttingen.

 Nevertheless the originality of Dirichlet in this celebrated investigation is
unquestionable, as there is nothing whatever in the Disq. Arith. to suggest

either the form of the result, or the method by which it is obtained *.

  We propose, in what follows, to give as full an analysis as our limits will

permit of the contents of the memoir. Its first section contains certain prin-
ciples relative to the theory of series.

  A(ii.) convergent infinite series may be convergent in two very different

ways. It may be convergent, and always have the same sum irrespective of the

arrangement of its terms ; or it may be convergent for certain arrangements

of its terms, giving the same or different sums for these different arrangements,

Weand divergent for other arrangements.           suppose, however, that we con-

sider only such different arrangements of the terms of a series as are compa-

tible witii the condition that any term which occupies &Jinitesimal place in

any one arrangement should occupy aJiTiitesimal '^\sice in every other arrange-

ment*. Thus the series

                    JI+P+2H-P          31+P+

is convergent, and has the same sum in whatever order we sum its terms

but of the two series

                                          2* 3' 4' 5^ 6^

               1+11+1+11 + ...

                                           3* 2^ 5* 7^ 4*

   * This condition is necessary, because without it the sum of no series whatever would be
independent of the arrangement of its terms, if by the sum of a series we understand the
limit to which we approximate by the continual addition of its terms in the order in which

they are given. For example, the series cited in the text,

                     >_j_ _1_ _i_

                                    ji+p+.^i+P+3i+P+ · · · . P 0,

is convergent, and its sum is irrespective of the arrangement of its terms, provided that
arrangement satisfy the condition enunciated in the text. But if we were to arrange the
terms of the series in an order regulated (say) by the number of primes dividing their deno-
minators, the limit to which we should continually approach by adding together the terms

                                                                                        11

taken in their new order, would be 2 "frr, in which p denotes any prime, and not S ,_).p,

only the first is convergent ; while the two series

For if we add together the k consecutive terms

we obtain a fraction of which the denominator is of the order ks in respect

series of the form S  , in which 0(»i) is a function of the order 1 +«

in respect of m. This series is always convergent for positive values of « ; its

convergence is irrespective of ihe arrangement of its terms, and its sum is a
continuous function of *, because <l>(m) is a continuous function of *. The
given series is therefore also convergent, and its sum is a continuous function

city of Jacobi and Legendre (arts. 15, 16, and 17 of this Report).

   The third and fourth sections contain the principal theorems relating to the

generic characters of quadratic forms, and to the representation of numbers.

There is only one of these theorems to which we need direct our attention
here, as the others have already come before us in the preceding articles.

may add that any values of x and y which satisfy these inequalities will give

a positive value to (a, h, c) ; for such a pair of values will correspond to a
point situated in the internal angle between the asymptotes of the hyperbola.

   The fifth section contains the demonstration of the theorem, that if A de-

note the absolute value of D, and i^(2A) be the number of numbers less than

D2A and prime to it, a properly primitive form of determinant will acquire

a value prime to 2D, if its indeterrainates x and y satisfy any one of a certain
set of 2A4'(2A) congruential conditions included among the 4A- conditions

represented by the formulae

               .r=a, mod 2A ; y=/3, mod 2A,

in which both a and /3 represent any term of a complete system of residues,

mod 2 A ; but will acquire a value not prime to 2D, if j- and y satisfy any of

the other congruential conditions.

If the form be improperly primitive, the number of congruential conditions

Athat will render its value unevenly even and prime to will be Ai^(A), or

D3A\/.(A), according as  modss 1 , or eees 5,    8.

These theorems are easily demonstrated by considering separately the

prime divisors of A. For example, if the form (a, b, c) be improperly

primitive, and /? be a prime divisor of D, since either a or c is prime to p,

+let a be prime to p\ then {ax byy--Dy'^ will be prime to jo, when

The combination of these results will give Dirichlet's theorem.

section of the memoir contains the demonstration of the formulae which

express in the form of an infinite series the number of classes of properly

Weand improperly primitive quadratic forms of a given determinant.          shall

abbreviate the demonstration of these formulae by using the theorem of

is not deduced from the expression for the number of properly primitive

Dirichlet also deduces from the formulas (A) and (B) the relation which

subsists between the numbers of properly primitive classes for any two

determinants which are to one another as two square numbers. It is suffi-

Dcient to consider two determinants such as and DS^, of which the former

    In a subsequent note (No. 7 in the list) Dirichlet infers from this ex-

pression that, given any positive determinant D, we can always deduce
from it an infinite number of determinants of the form DS^ having all the
same numbers of classes. For if we attribute to S a series of values of the
form TT.s", all composed of the same prime numbers s, and having continually
increasing numbers for the indices of those primes, it appears from a remark

to which we have already referred (see art. 96, v.), that the quotient - will

eventually be constant ; i. e. there will exist an infinite series of determinants,

all composed of the same primes, and all having the same number of pro-
perly primitive classes. As it is possible to find determinants contained in a
series of this kind, and having only one class in each genus, it appears that
the number of the positive determinants, which have only one class in each
genus, is infinite. This result, which was anticipated by Gauss (Disq. Arith.
art. SOi), is remarkable, because it is probable, from the result of a very-
extensive induction, that there are but 65 negative determinants, of which

--the greatest is 1848, having the same property.

 --lOl. Summation of the series expressing the number of Properly Primitive

form for the number of classes, we may confine our attention to the order
of properly primitive forms, and may suppose that the determinant is not

Dirichlet employs the formulae given by Gauss in his memoir, " Summatio
Serierum quarundam siugularium," to which we have already referred in this
Report (art. 20). The ninth section is occupied with the demonstration of
these formulae ; in the tenth they are applied to the summation of the series

S[- ) -. Two different methods are given by Dirichlet, by either of which

this summation can be effected.

  When n is uneven and not divisible by any square, the two sums

    In the particular case in which the determinant is a prime of the form

+iw S taken negatively, an expression for the number of classes had already

been given by Jacobi (Crelle, vol. ix. p. 189). It would seem, from his note

on the division of the circle (Crelle, vol. xxx. p. 166), that the unpublished

method, by which his result was obtained, formed a part of tiiat theory.

Address by G. B. Atrt, M.A., F.B.S., Astronomer Boyal, President of the

       Section.

The President said it was usual, in opening the proceedings of this Section, to

commence with a few words, stating generally the ODJect for which they were met,

and the way in which they proposed to cany it out. That Section was one which

dealt with Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, and under these heads they in-

cluded everything which was not of a technical natm'e, and which was the subject

of mathematical treatment. Eveiything which was reducible to measures or forces

came properly under their consideration, if it were not expressly a subject belonging

to some technical Section. Cosmology, or the changes which the world has imder-

gone, came properly before them ; and that Section might be considered as dealing
with the genus of all the sciences which were subjects of measure or number.

Its siibjects might be compared with those which most of our Universities made the

foundation for the important degi'ee of Arts, and which are understood to be the

best foimdation of education possible to provide for the human mind. It was to

those subjects that the early efforts of the Association were directed, and in a gi'eat

measure it was those subjects that had enabled the Association to acquire its pre-

sent importance. It was well known to members of that Association that its

earliest etforts were directed to astronomy; almost the earliest expenditure of

money by the Association was in reference to astronomy, and the worts the Asso-

ciation had published at its own expense had been amongst the most valuable con-

tributions to that science. By the expenditm-e, of money in that way, the Associa-

tion had acquired a command over the Government which had enabled it to call

for assistance in very huportant matters. The reduction of the lunar observations

at the Eoyal ObseiTatoiy at Greenwich was undertaken in consequence of the

urgency of the representations made by the British Association, and anybody who
knew the history of science would admit that that gi-eat work was one of the most

important services that had been rendered to astronomy. There were other sub-

jects to which benefit had been derived fi-oni the representations of the Association,

amongst which he might mention the great magnetic expeditions under the direc-

tion of Major-General Sabine. These expeditions, which had been effected at

the expense of the Government, had made us acquainted with magnetism all over

the eartli, and had given us information such as we could not have got in any other

way. In speaking thus of the importance of these subjects, and of their proper

connexion with that Section, he had only to say that they shoidd be happy to

receive any communication bearing upon similar subjects. In dealing with them,

it was desirable in all cases that they should consider themselves as treating ques-

tions strictly of science. In the next place, he hoped that those who made com-

munications would bear in muid that their time was to be used, and not wasted.

It was desirable that nothing shoidd be brought before the Meeting that would not

plicated technical papers whicli could not be understood without a month's study

of a printed book. In the next place, recapitulations of what had been done before

ouo-ht to be as brief as possible. And whilst he hoped that the papers would be

well discussed, he trusted that personality of every kind woidd be strictly eschewed.

It was known to those present that great ingenuity had been employed upon cer-

tain abstract propositions of mathematics which had been rejected by the learned

in all ao-es, such as finding the length of the circle, and pei-petual motion. In the

best academies of Em-ope, it was established as a rule that subjects of that kind

should not be admitted, and it was desirable that such communications should not

be made to that Section, as they were a mere loss of time.

The President then stated that at the last meetiug Professor Stokes was requested

to make a repoii, at the instance of the Committee of that Section, on " The present

state of Physical Optics." He had written to say that he had been prevented by a

gi-eat quantity of public business from preparing a report in time for that meeting,

but he engaged to prepare it in time for the next meetiug of the Association, and

the Conuuittee had requested him to do so. He had to make a similar explanation

with reference to a report that had been promised by JNIi". Cayley on the solution of

specific problems of dynamics. The Committee had requested him to prepare his

report in time for the next meeting of the Society.                                                          «

             On Curves of the TJiird Order. By A. Catlet, F.B.S.

  A cirrve of the third order, or cubic curve, is the section of a cubic cone, and

such cone is intersected by a concentric sphere in a spherical cubic. It is an obvious
consequence of a theorem of Sir Isaac Newton's, that there are five principal kinds

of cubic cones, or, what is the same thing, five principal kinds of spnerical cubics
but the natm'e of these five kinds of spherical cubics was first distinctly explained
by Mobius. They may be designated the simplex, the comphx, the crunodal, the
acnodal, and the cuspidal; where crimode, acnode denote respectively the two
species of double points (nodes), viz. the double point with two real branches, and
the conjugate or isolated point. The foregoing results are known; the special
object of the paper was to establish a subdi\-ision of the simplex kind of spherical
cm-ves. The simplex kind is a continuous re-entering cmne cutting a great circle
(to fix the ideas say the equator) in three pairs of opposite points, which are the
three real inflexions of the cm-ve. The three gi-eat circles, which are the tangents at

the inflexions, and the equator, divide the entire surface of the sphere into fourteen
regions, whereof eight are ti-ilateral, and the remaining six quadi-Uateral. The cur^'e

may lie entirely in six out of the eight ti-ilateral regions, and it is in this case said
to be simplex trilateral ; or it may lie entirely in the six quadrilateral regions, and it

is in this case said to be simplex quadrilateral : and there is an intei-mediate foiTU,

the simplex neutral; \az. in this case the three great circles, tangents to the in-

flexions, meet in a pair of opposite points, and there ai-e in aU only twelve regions,

all trilateral ; the curve lies entu-ely in six of these regions.

On t7ie General Forms of the Symmetrical Properties of Plane Triangles.
                            By Thomas Dobson, B.A.

This paper establishes among the distances from an indefinite plane of the sym-

metrical points connected -with a plane ti-iangle certain genei-al relations, which yield

several con-esponding cognate plane properties when difterent definite positions are

   The group given at page 6 of the " Transactions of the Sections of the British
Association for 1860 " is one of the equivalents of a gi-ouped gi-oup, which is of
the class described by M. Camille Jordan in the 4th chapter of his These " Sur le
Nombre des Valem-s des Fonctions " (Paris, Mallet-Bachelier, 1860, or Jom-nal de
I'Ecole Polytechnique, 1861). The fh'st foiu- substitutions of that group foi-m one
of the gi'ouped groups described by Cauchy in his " Meuioire sm- les Arrangements,"
&c. (Exercices d Analyse et de Physique "Mathematique, tome troisieme).

   M. Joi-dan's gi-oup is formed by writing in the auxiliary group

                                                             1234

whose general tlieory has not, so far as I know, been given. In fact the auxiliary

groups on which they are constructed are of a kind entirely new, of which- a brief

account may be seen at the end of my memoir " On the Theory of Groups and

many-valued Functions," in the forthcoming volume of the 'Memoirs of the

Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester,' 1861.

                        43^21%              4=3^21.

   The peculiarity of these groups (h, h') is that the four elements therein are
affected with different exponents, which are essential to the groups, and cannot dis-
appear from them or from their eqviivalents.

   Thus (h) and (h') give the two groups

  We Hmay substitute in either or H' for each one v of the four elements a group

pennutations of the vertical rows of u. The constracted is always a grouped group,

which is no group of powers, nor equivalent to that built on the auxiliarj' with

--a= 1, if we take a such that it shall not be prime to 2a 2, that is, if we take for

a any even value.

  HWhen a is odd, and H' are still groups, and proper auxiliaries ; but I believe

that the gTouped group consti'ucted will always be equivalent to the one formed by
taking a=l, that is, the two gToups will differ neither in the number nor in the

orders of the circidar factors of their substitutions.

  HThere is but one square root of imity in the gTOup given by when a =4, of

   There are six groups, each containing thi-ee cube roots of 231564897 and three
cube roots of 312645978, that is three 6th roots of 231564897.

   All these are mere groups of nine powers, and are therefore no addition to our
knowledge of groups ; but they are formed by the process of evolution, as ffroiiped
groujjs of roots, comprising of necessity all powers of those roots, whereas such
groups are usually formed by the process of involution.

   Eveiy gToup of powers of a substitution which has two or more cu'cular factors
of the same order can be written out either by the process of involution, beginning
with a principal substitution next to unity, or by the process of evolution, beginning
next to imity with a substitution of a Imcer or of the lowest wde); by means of an
auxUiaiy gi-oup.

   For example, the eight cube roots of 214365 are written by the auxiliary groups

the case of a falling particle may be zero) in a given dii'ection. The place on the

   As these are linear equations of the fii-st order, they are easily integrated ; and if

w=the velocity of projection, and ya,, /3, are the dii'ection-angles of the line of
projection, we have

          B = M<COSy-- (?+m<bcosXcoS|8| t^;

which three equations give the place of the projectile at the time t. Now, without

proceeding further at present in the process of approximation, let us consider two
particular cases and resxdts, which are of consideraole interest.

   (1) Let the body fall, as e. g. down a mine, without any initial velocity ; then

w=Oj cos [«=cos/3=0j cosy=-- 1;

                                                                                           y= --a>gcos\

The first equation shows that there is no deviation in the line of the meridian
from the second we infer a deviation towards the eastj that is, ia the direction
                                                                --

towards which the earth is moving ; which varies as the cuhe of the time of falling;

\=0iand that this deviation is gi-eatest at the equator, where  : and the last equa-

tion shows that the earth's rotation does not produce any alteration in the time of

falling.

If we eliminate t, and take z downwards to be positive,

          y= ^s%_(cosX)^22

                               ,3.

which is the equation to a semicubical parabola, and shows that the square of the
deviation towards the east varies as the cube of the space through which the par-
ticle has fallen.

   (2) Let the particle be projected due southwards at an angle of elevation equal
to 6; then

                                       cos a8=cos 6, cos /3=0, cos ·y=sin 6;

and x=ut cos 6, ~\

                                                         j

From the first and the last of these equations we infer that neither the time nor the
range on the meridian is altered by the rotation of the earth. Also when 3=0,

that is, when the projectile strikes the groimd, <= _?i^l5_; in which case
                                                                              9

and therefoi'e the point where the projectile sti-ikes the groimd is west of the meri-
dian so long as ^ is less than 180°-- tan ~^ (3tanX): and the deviation vanishes

if ^=180° -- 3 tan~' (3 tan X). The deviation is eastwards if d is greater than
180° -3 tan ' (3tanX).

  Now these results, which have herein been applied to the motion of a material

particle, are also true of that of the centre of gi-avity of a body. Neglecting there-

fore the resistance of the air, and the action due to the -rotation of a ball or bolt,

they are applicable to rifle and cannon practice, and we have the following results.

  When the shot is fired due north or south, the range in that direction is not

altered, but there is always a deviation of the shot, the value of which at the point
of impact on the ground is given in the last equation.

   Also from the preceding equations the following residts may be deduced :

  When the shot is fired due east, the range eastwards is increased or diminished

according as the angle of elevation of the gim is less than or gTeater than 60° ; and
the deviation is southwards for all places in the northern hemisphere, and north-
wai'ds for all places in the southern hemisphere.

  When the shot is fired due west, the range is increased or diminished accoi-ding

as the angle of elevation is gi'eater than or less than 60° ; and the de-viation is
northwards for all places in the northern hemisphere, and southwards for all places

in the southern hemisphere.

   So that for firing fi-om a place in a direction coincident with the parallel of lati-
tude, and with an elevation less than 60°, the range is increased or diminished

according as we fire eastwards or westwards ; and the difierence between the two

rano;es

                                                      '"^{3 (cos 5)2 -(sin (9)^};

                                       3^

and if the place is in the northern hemisphere, the deviation parallel to the meri-

dian is north or south, according as we fire west or east.

  Now these eflects have been inferred from the equations of motion, simplified by

the assumption that products of oj-, and one of the relative coordinates of in, are

small quantities, and are to be neglected. Let us now retain these quantities, and

assume that products of co^ and of a small variable are to be neglected ; and that all
small quantities of a lower order are to be retained.

  We shall suppose the values of x, y, z mven ahove to be approximate solutions

of the first order of the equations; and if, according to the general method of

solution adopted in such cases, we substitute these values in terms involving
a>^x, (o^i/, and (o-z, that is in the smallest terms which we intend to retain, and,

omitting terms of higher orders, then integrate the simultaneous ditferential equa-

stances. I will take only two.

The first equation shows that there is a deviation of the falling particle in the line

of the meridian towards the south ; and the second shows that the deviation in the
parallel of latitude is towards the east ; so that the resulting deviation of the faUino-

body is towards the south-east. This result is in accordance with the case many

years ago investigated by Hooke, the contemporary of Su- 1. Newton. From the

last equation it appears that the space due to a given time is less than it would be
if there were no rotation.

         On Petzval's Asym];)totic Method of solving Differential Equations.
                       By Wllliam Spottiswoode, M.A., F.R.S.

    The researches of M. Petzval here brought under notice are directed to the sohi-
tion of those linear differential equations with variable coefficients which have

reference to motions, themselves small, but propagated to gi-eat distances. In such
equations y usually represents the distiu'bance, and x the distance from the origin.

If then the solution y=:f(x) be considered as the equation to a cm-ve, the method
proposed by the author will give the values of y con-espouding to large values of x

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

in other words, the asymptotes to the curve in question. Hence the name " Asym-

ptotic Solution."

   With a view to this object M. Petzval proposes the following question : Can any

general laws be established, with respect to the coefficients of a differential equa-
tion, capable of furnishing criteria for determining the natm'e of the particular in-
tegrals which satisfy it? Having first made such a classification of functions as
renders his conclusions capable of conversion, in the logical sense of the term, he pro-
ceeds to form, from a given equation of the degi-ee n,

                     X,,y(»)+X,,_i2/(»-i)+ . . Xoy = (X,y)(»)=0,

the equation of the degree («+»·), (Z,s)(n+''")=0, arising from the introduction of r
particular integrals of a given form.

   Passing over the case of algebraic integrals, some of the criteria of which are com-

mon to exponentials, the more important cases are as follow :

                           On the Involution of Axes of Rotation.

                        By Professor Sylvester, M.A., F.B.S.

   After a brief statement as to the most general mode of representing the displace-
ment of a rigid body in space by means of angular rotations about six distinct axes
fixed in position, it was shown that under pecidiar conditions the six axes woidd
become insufficient, being, in fact, equivalent to a smaller number, in which case
they would be said to form a system in involution. Various constructions for re-
presenting such and similar systems were stated, and the remarkable conclusion

presented, that the necessary aud sufficient condition for three, four, five, or six lines
being thus mutually, as it were, implicated and involved consists in their lying in
rided sm-faces of the first, second, third, and fom-th orders respectively. The theoiy

of involution originated with Prof Mobius, by whom, however, it had been left in
an imperfect contlition. The author referred for further infoi-mation on the subject
to some recent notes by himself in the ' Comptes Eendus ' of the Academy of
Sciences of Paris, and to certain masterly geometrical investigations of M. Chasles
and Mr. Cayley, to which these had given rise.

RemarTfs onDv. Hincks's Paper on the Acceleration of the Moon^s Mean Mo-
    tion as indicated by the Records of Ancient Eclipses. By the Asteonojcek

     Royal.

    The author stated his unaltered conviction that the Tables of Hansen gave the
 date of the gi'eat solar eclipse which temiinated the Lydian war, as all the most

reliable records of antiquity fixed it, in the year 585 B.C. He said he must first

recall to their remembrance some geogi-aphical facts, and he sketched on the
board a rough plan of Asia Minor, Upper Asia, the Black Sea, and the Mediter-

ranean. An impassable moimtain bamer, which the ancients called Mount Taurus,

stretches across Detween Asia Minor and Upper Asia, lea\Tiig only two passes at all
 practicable for an anny : one to the north, along the shore of the Black Sea, cele-
Iarated for the well-known retreat of the Ten Thousand Greeks, as chronicled by
Xenophon, but so extremely difficidt that only one anny besides had ever traversed
it; the other to the south-east of Asia IMinor, through which, all the circumstances
rendered it highly probable, the invading Asspian anny entered Asia Minor, as it
was certain the anny of Alexander the Great passed through it in the opposite
direction when he invaded Syria, Egypt, and Upper Asia ; and every other recorded
march between Asia Minor and Upper Asia had been made through the same pass.
Now, in the line between this pass aud the capital of Lydia it was nearly certain
the decisive battle was fought, and calculation from the Tables showed that at the
date assigned to the eclipse, commonly called the Eclipse of Thales, because pre-

dieted by him, tte centre of a total eclipse of the sun actually swept over this di-

strict. The Astronomer Royal then explained how Thales was able, by the aid of

the Saros, or period of 18 years 15 days and 8 hours, to predict the eclipse ; and

then, if the pre\-iously-observed eclipse at the beginnino' of this cycle occurred in

the morning (which agi-ees with calcidation), the odd 8 hours would ensure that
this one woidd occm- in the afternoon (which also agrees with calculation), and the

eclipse might really be predicted, as was recorded. He then pointed out how cal-

culation from the same Tables led us to the time and circimistances of the eclipse

of Agathocles, when the Grecian fleet escaped out of the harbour of Syracuse ; also
to the darlmess, which, no doubt, was an eclipse, which was stated to have taken

place when the Persian army entered Larissa or Nimrud.

On the Resistance of the Ether to the Comets and Planets, and on the Botation

   This paper was an application to the motions of the comets and planets of the
following theorem, on the hypothesis, favom-ed or adopted by Encke and Ponte-
coulant, of a medimn whose resistance is inversely as the square of the distance from
the Sim. According as the resultant of the resistance to a revolving and rotating
body passes or not through the centre of gravity, will it affect the revolution or the

rotation of the body.

Some Considerations on M. Haidinger's Communication on the Origin and

ByFall of Aerolites.  U. ^P. Q-r^g, F.G.S.

   M. Haidinger and Dr. Laurence Smith differ in then- opinion as to the cause and

origin of the blackish-colom-ed crust observed in almost all meteoric stones ; the latter
conceives that they were thus coated previous to their entering the confines of the

earth's atmosphere ; the former much more reasonably alleges that it has been caused

by simple supei-ficial fusion after the meteorite has entered the atmosphere, either
by resistance to the air causing heat, or by the superheated ah- surrounding the
stony matter of the fireball itself. Dr. Smith seems to have been misled by

circumstances presented on the fall of some very large stones in Ohio, May 1, 1860,

which evidently at the time of their fall could not have been very hot. But he

seems to have overlooked the fact stated by Haidiuger, that in larr/e stones (espe-
cially) the internal parts must affect the temperatm-e of intei-planetary space, and
tend almost instantaneously to efface the very superficial heat caused by the sudden

fiising of their exterior.

   M. Haidinger and Dr. Smith both agi-ee in thinking that meteorites enter oui*
atmosphere more commonly in groups or "flocks " of small fragments, than as a

single and larger mass. This seems to me opposed both to fact and probability. In

the case of the celebrated fall of meteoric stones at L'Aigle in Normandy, in 180-3,
April 26, though it is quite true that nearly 3000 stones fell (the major nmubernot
larger than walnuts, and the largest only seventeen pounds), yet we must bear in
mind that but one single fireball was seen previously to the bmsting and fall of the
meteorite. The stones presented iiTegular shapes, chiefly angular, with the edges
slightly rounded, and all similarly covered with a crust. Surely it is more natural
to conceive that one large fr'agment was by explosion and imequal heating broken

up into many smaller ones. Moreover, were indi\-idual fireballs to contain within
themselves numerous small stones, woidd it not rather militate against M. Haid-
inger's theory, since the opposing air would then pass between them like a sieve,

and the whole notion of the head of the meteorite forcing up before it the film of air
that is to curl up behind (to contain the vacumn which on the collapse of the fire-
ball is to cause the noise), would have to he abandoned as untenable.

   M. Haidinger's idea that the noise or report is caused by the collapse of the
vacuiun can'ied forward in the rear of the fireball deserves attentive consideration,
and much might be said in favom* of it as well as against it. Besides the possibility

of the noise being due to the discharge of electricity. Dr. Smith likewise considers
the noise is not caused by the bm\sting of a solid, but rather by concussion in the
atmosphere arising from the rapid motion of the body through it*. Mr. Benjamin

* But, then, why should we not hear the noise produced by the simple passage of any

--14 REPORT 1861.

Marsh, in his able notice of the great daylight meteor in the United States, No-

vember 15, 1859, affirms, however, that the sowid following the bm-sting of that
meteor " was explosive, and not caused hj the falling in of the au- after the meteor,
as in the latter case it must have been continuous and interrupted ; but the testimony

of Dr. Beesley and others shows that it ceased entirely and then began again. Sup-

pose the meteor to have been a stony mass, we may perhaps consider the explosion

to have consisted of a series of decrepitations caused by the sudden expansion and
heating of the surface. At the forward end these explosions woidd take place under

great pressure, which may accoimt for the loudness of the sound." Again, "the

explosions were very numerous, the whole occupying only half a second of time

but the individual soimds were distinguishable because of the difierent distances

they had to ti'avel to reach the eai- ; the whole dm-ation of the sound extending ia

reality over a minute."

  Tliough I am inclined to agree to a great extent with Mr. Marsh respecting the

cause and effects of the soimd being caused by a series of decrepitations taking place,
imder pressure of the resisting atmosphere, yet that would hardly explain the sud-

den disruption and disappearance of fireball's, actually occm-iing in the majority of

cases ; it woidd be too gi-adual a breaking up to accord altogether with facts.

   One obstacle in the way of a satisfactoiy solution arises from the difficulty of

ascertaining the real size of an aerolitic fii-eball, which at the distance of 40 mUes

or more may appear as large as the moon ; for it has been proved that a very small
body, such as a small stone, when in a state of powerful incandescence, appears

much larger than it really is ; e. g., Dr. Smith has himself shown that a piece of

lime less than half an inch in diameter, in the flame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe,

has, in a clear evening, appeai-ed at the distance of half a mUe to present an appa-
rent diameter equal to twice that of the moon ! On the other hand, while this fact
seems to afford us facilities for a simple solution, it may still be qiute possible that

the stony matter is but a nucleus inside a larger envelope of highly compressed and

heated air, containing likewise, as Haidinger supposes and explains, the vacuiun,

which subsequently collapses with a loud report.

It may be here mentioned, that occasionally lai'ge meteore (evidently aerolitic)

have been seen to divide into two nearly equal portions (a loud detonation follow-

ing some minutes afterwards), and that both have then passed off again into space

without other apparent change*.

It is also equally certain that no noise is heard unless a large fireball actually

bm"sts into two or more considerable portions ; and that the principal noise is cer-

Howtainly the dii-ect result of this rupture.  such violent noises and atmospheric

concussions as take place are produced and also heard and felt on the surface of

the earth is sti-ange, and as yet not fully undei-stood : the height at which fireballs

thus burst varies from 15 to 40 mUes. The cases where stones have fallen fi'om fii-e-

balls without noise ai'e veiy rare indeed.

Dr. Lam-ence Smith considers the liffht emitted by fireballs does not arise from

mere incandescence, but is caused hj electricity and other causes. M. Haidinger

speaks of air heated to whiteness. There must, however, be a certain amount of

light ai-ising fi-oni the incandescence of solid matter, judging fi-om the fused crusts

of all aerolites, and from the fact of some meteorites, especially iron ones, being

known to fall red-hot ; but that at heights of fi'om 20 to 40 or even 100 miles,
where the supply of oxygen must be inconceivably small, part of the liglit may be

owing to a development of electricity, seems highly probable.

large meteor ? No noise is ever heard unless the entire fireball is ruptured or flies to pieces.
Besides, at elevations of 30 or 40 miles the air woidd be too rarefied to produce much noise

from simply rusliing into the space left in the wake of the meteorite.
   * As was the case with the celebrated meteors of August 18, 1783, in England, and that

of July 20, 1860, in North America ; which being the fact, goes against M. Haidinger's
theory of incandescent air enclosing a vacuum in the rear of the main fireball ; for the

bursting would, in the cases just cited, probably have destroyed, at least temporarily, their
subsequent visible existence. In these two eases it seems mcst reasonable to suppose that
a large stone (several feet in diameter), wliile in a state of high superficial incandescence,
"broke" into two parts with a loud crack or report, the sound of which, under the very
great jjressure caused by resistance to the atmosphere, would be greatly magnified or in-

creased.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  15

   In briefly alluding to the origin of meteorites, I consider it now almost univer-

sally admitted by the highest authorities, that, mineralogically speaking, aerolites

falling to the earth are merely fragments of larger rocks, some of which may be

considered to be strictly volcanic : whether stone or iron, they enter our atmosphere

as in-egular-shaped fragments, which may again become broken into smaller frag-

ments before reaching the surface of the earth. In explaining the original_ or
" naacent " state of meteoric matter as he does, M. Haidinger is simply proposing

a new theory to account for the original condition of planetary matter and its con-
solidation and whether that was fluid or gaseous, or pulvende)it, may perhaps be

                                               ;

a step too remote for the present state of aerolitic investigation ; though whether
then- present condition will thi-ow additional light on the physical history of our

own earth, or the reveree, I am not prepared at present to say. The idea that

meteoric stones are fragments of a larger and broken-up mass of planetary matter,
itself originally formed', as I understand it, by the external consolidation, by gi-avi-

tation, of fine impalpable dust, in the form of an external crust (or series of con-
centric crusts), internally conti-acting somewhat after the manner of septaria, and

aftei-wards, fi-om heat, chemical action, unequal expansion, bm-sting like a projectile

filled with explosive material, is certainly a bold idea, and I only regi-et that M.
Haidiuger's abstract of his original paper does not more fully give all his facts,

comparisons, and argmnents. To my own mind, however, the idea of an original

state of tine planetary dmt is not satisfactoiy ; for dust rather implies the notion of

waste, or wear and teai* of matter already pre%'iously consolidated.

   However originally fonned, oiu- meteoric planet may in the course of time be

supposed from some cause or other to become broken up into fragments more or
less dispersed, and occasionally, in the form of aerolites, to come into contact with

our own earth. This may be all the more probable, when I add that I hear that
 M. Leverrier has qiute receatly come to the conclusion that there exists " a mass

 of matter equal to about ^^th of the mass of the earth revolving roimd the sun at
 veiy nearly the same mean distance as the earth, and which is probably split up
 into an immense number of small asteroids." (See Monthly Register of Facts for

 August 1861.)

    The sti-uctm'e, composition, and specific gi'avity* of meteorites agree very closely
 with that of similar rocks on bur own globe ; and it may not be unreasonable to

 suppose that the former are representatives of that mysterious planetaiy matter, of

 whose aggregate mass M. Leverrier has just informed us, and which in the course of
 ages, at the rate of several thousand tons annually, may eventually be all absorbed,
 as Eeichenbach has suggested, by our own earth.

An attempt to account for the Physical Condition and the Fall of Meteorites
   upon our Planet. By W. HAiDryGEE, Eon. Mem. B.S. L. Sf E., H.F.E.G.S.,

   F.F.G.S., H.M. SS. of Cambridge, Manchester, Edinburgh, Truro, 6fc.

   I beg leave to lay before the British Association for the Promotion of Science,

the outline of some considerations which have been impressed on my mind during

late studies in this most interesting department of physical science, and one which

is still involved in many difficulties and contradictions.
   In order to give a more general view of the present state of progTess, I mention

the names of some of the more active promoters of the science in om* own days.
The Imperial Collection at Vienna, which took the lead under v. Schreibei-s and
Partsch, is still foremost imder Dr. Homes, but closely followed by Prof Shepard

in New Haven ; Baron Reichenbach in Vienna ; the British Museum under the en-

lightened superintendence of Mr. Nevil Stoiy Maskelyne ; Pi'of Gustavus Rose in

--Berlin ; Prof. Wohler in Gottingen ; Mr. R. P. Greg in Manchester, each pos-

sessing fi'om 100 to 163 meteorites with distinct dates of fall or discovery ; to the
labours of the above-named, add also those of Rammelsberg, Lam-ence Smith in
Louisville, Kentiicky, 0. Buchner in Giessen. The recent remarkable fixlls of

aerolites near New Concord, and in Guernsey County, Ohio, on the 1st of May,

and near Dharamsala, KangTa, Pimjab, on the 14th of July, both in 1860, the

to have originally existed as veins in the original meteoric planet.
--16 REPORT 186],

large iron masses brought to light near Melbomiie in Australia, and other facts

full of interest, are keeping alive the attention of philosophers.

  Having joined my excellent fiiend Dr. Homes in the wish to enlarge our Impe-

rial Collection of aerolites, I have from time to time had to give notice of several

newly observed facts, and at each step to endeavom- to accoimt for some one or

other peculiarity. As a result, it seemed to me that I had arrived at a pretty com-

plete theory both of the circumstances attending the fall of meteorites, and the

conditions of theu- consolidation before they entered our atmosphere.

   Explanations relative to the tellimc fall of aerolites, though more known than
formerly, are still not devoid of many difficidties ; but these are far surpassed by

the difficidties attending the cosmic question, which in fact amoimt to nothing less
than a complete theoiy of the original fonnation of celestial bodies generally, at
least of the two which come into contact with each other, the aerolite and our own

planet. I beg leave to begin with some considerations on the first of these ques-

--tions.
   1. The Phenomena of the Fall of Aerolites. ^There can be no doubt relative to the

fact that the crust of aerolites, and their body or mass, are foimed in two difierent

ways, the one by superficial melting, the other by long-continued consolidation.
The fomi of aerolites beti-ays them" originally to have been frapnents. This is
most universally gi-anted. In this direction Sir David Brewster and Humboldt

gave their verdicts ; this also has been placed forward by Lam-ence Smith and Mr.
Greg. " Viewed from most positions, the largest meteoric stone (that of 103 lbs.

weight, in Marietta College, Ohio, fi-om the faU of May 1st, 1860) is angidar, and
appears to have been recently broken from a larger body." Many other examples

might be adduced.

   It is well known that in some cases, as at Sti-akowitz, on November 28th, 1859,
and Pegu, December 27th, 1827, the semblance of enlarging and approaching aero-

litic fireballs has been observed and                                                                 _.

--known pits, roughness or smoothness, rounded and bulging-out edges it may be

inferred that some of the single stones connected with a fall of a swarm or
shower, or the gi-eater number of them, have not been detached fi-om a larger
body, but that they have entered the atmosphere unconnected with any other, and
have always kept one position, the fore part and sides being uniformly rough, while
the back part, though smoother, is covered with depressions, showing what has been

called the "pitted surface of meteorites.

                                                                      Fi?. 3.

   The compression of the air of the atmosphere, and the centre of expansion
formed, will not only give the rise in temperature, produce light, and foiTu a ball,
but it must also impart a rotatory movement, and at last aii-est the solid matter
(stone or iron) in its course. The cosmic portion of its track, still continuing at A,

Mfig. 3, when the meteorite entera the atmosphere, is closed at C, and from thence

it drops simply to the ground at D, in its telluric ti-ack, like any other heavy body,

Bgravitating only towards oiu: planet. Particles scaling off at a point may ap-

pear like spai'ks to us, while the surface may easily be covered again by a new but

thinner crust, before the stone reaches the point C. Stones falling to the earth in

this way appear black in the aii-, from the comparative slowness of movement,
several of them together sometimes resembling " a flock of birds." No fireball is
seen where the aerolitic botlies themselves can be distinguished, as is stated, among

other falls, in that of New Concord, Ohio, of May 1, 1860.

   During the time of the downfall and immediately after it, the temperature of
the crust, which must have been sufficiently high to" melt it, again meets the low
temperature of the interior of the aerolite, which must have been the same in the

larger aerolite as that of cosmic space. It is said that lai'ge masses when taken up
appear to the touch " no wanner than if they had lain on the groimd exposed to
the sun's rays." This is the expression used by Prof. Laurence Smith, when

speaking of the fall of New Concord and of Guernsey County on the 1st of May,

1860. The mass of ii-on which fell, Januaiy 1844, in the Caritas Paso, in Comentes
(R. P. Greg, Philosophical Magazine for July 1855), came down, however, most
intensely heated, which prevented a near approach to it, even some horns after its
fall. But this may also be accounted for by the greater conducting power of fron
for heat. On the other hand, fragments of stone taken up, e. g., after the fall of
Dhurmsala or Dhai-msala, Kangi-a, Punjab, on July 14, 1860, were found so intensely
cold, that the natives who took up some of them, " before they had held them in
their hands half a minute, it is said, had to drop them, owing to the intensity of

cold, which quite benumbed their fingers." No description relative to the matter

of which these Dhai-msala stones consist has as yet been published.
   One very peculiar featm-e attending in most instances the fall of meteorites, is the

phenomenon of "tenific bm-sting noise," of "reports most terrible, filling the
neighbom-hood with awe," fi-equently "several of them following each other;" as
also that characteristic "rumbling " which follows the main reports, or a sequel of
peals^ of musketry, and sometimes hissing sounds. I should venture to propose a
solution dependent simply on the well-known physical fact, that soimd more or
less loud may be produced from the mere suddenly filling up of an empty space or

vacuum with air. I am happy to say that I am supported in this supposition by
Prof. Laiu-ence Smith, who likewise, quite independently, came to the same result.

These reports, or succession of several reports, are called " explosions," and, gene-
rally speaking, the fireballs at the same time disappear. But certainly it is not

such aa explosion as we might expect from a projectile filled with gunpowder. On.

the contrary, when the meteor considered above is arrested by the atmosphere,

then the air rushing in from all sides would fill up the vacuum, till then sur-

rounded by the film of incandescent air emanating from the centre of expansion

in front of the advancing fireballs.

  I believe I am safe in assuming the following deductions as well explained :

1. The incandescent ball is produced by the compression of the atmospheric air.

   2. The sounds, reports, and rimiblings are produced by the concussion of the air
in the vacmmi of the fireball when arrested.

   3. Showers of aerolites in the generality of cases are produced by groups of

meteorites enteiing oUr atmosphere togethei*. There may oe in some cases larger

masses flying to pieces by rotation.

4. The crust is produced by the melting of the superficial portion of the fi'ag-

ments. The high temperature produced is lowered immediately after the begin-

ning of the real fall by the intense cold of the interior.

1 have enumerated these points to show the concordance in some, and the differ-

ence of opinion in others, of those enimierated by Prof. Laurence Smith in SiUi-

man's American Jom-nal, vol. xxxi. January 1861, p. 98.

 --n. Origin of the rocky substance of Aerolites. Having to account for b, fragment

of rock broken otf fi'om its original repository and traversing cosmic space by itself,

the question is simply to give, as a first step, an outline of the possible consolidation

of matter in its most attenuated condition into a solid body, and then to give a plau-

sible cause why it may be shattered to pieces. The theories of the present day,
that of La Place at the head of them, are familiar to philosophers. All of them

must assume cosmic matter in the finest state of dust to begin with. But the as-

simiption of a temperature so high as to contain only one thirteen-millionth part

of a gi-ain (0-000013) in a cube of space, the side of which is of the length of one

German mile, is far too gratuitous, as well as inconsistent with our knowledge of

Wethe physical properties of matter.      know cosmic space to be intensely cold.

For thousands of years there has been no change experienced relative to the tem-

peratm-e of the earth's sm-face.

It may be a question whether it may not be possible for heat to be generated

even in the cold of cosmic space, by the simple action of gravitation upon the par-

ticles of attenuated matter, in thefr most nascent state. This will lead to conse-

quences closely agreeing with the views of De la Rive, Sir Charles Lyell and others,

as to the production of the central heat of our planet, as quoted by Prof. Naumann

Nowin his ti'eatise on Geology, page 63.  we may aiTange all sorts of meteoric

rocks in an imintenoipted series, beginning with the most crystalline state that

many meteorites and meteoric irons frequently exhibit, and following them up to

several of those marbled composite specimens, such as those of Pamallee, Breme-

vorde and others, which bear the closest resemblance to our tufaceous deposits, but

in which no water has been at work. I have ventiu-ed to propose for this charac-

teristic structm-e the expression of " Meteoritic Tufa." And even beyond that,

there are still more tender and fragile specimens, approaching to mere aggregations
.of powder or dust, like the one of the fall at Alais, March 15, 1806, or of Cold

Bokkeveld of October 13, 1838. It is certainly a fair induction to suppose the more

solid and crystalline of these rocks to have been fonued out of the consolidation of

matter originally in a state of dust, or nascent.

   If we conceive the diagram, fig. 4 (taken fi-om Dr. Kopp's article, " Physik und

Meteorologie," in the Biideker publication on Natural

Science, Die gesammten Naturwissenschaften), to repre-

sent a large globe of cosmic matter in the state of the

finest impalpable dust in its most "nascent state," every

Apoint situated like will be attracted with equal force

B Dby other points and similarly situated, so that its

total direction will tend towards the centre C. Near the

centre, the attraction towards it will not be nearly so

Sowerful ; in the centre itself givwtation will have no
  efinite direction at all, the particles of matter being

solicited by attraction in each of the diverging du'ections.

Consolidation then will depend upon the pressure coming

into play from the surface stratum only.
--20 REPORT 1861.

   As a very nearly analogou8 case, I may turn to the well-known " Septaria " con-

cretions, consistinff chiefly of carbonate of u'on or clay iron ore, compressed from

without and yielding to pressure, till the outward stratum has assmiied so much of

consistency that it will act like an arch or vault against further pressure, while the
inside still remains in a softer state, which, however, is afterwards lost by contrac-
tion of the main substance, while in the fissures carbonates of lime and magnesia,

or even iron pyrites, are deposited. The diagi-am (fig. 5) is taken by stereotype from
a specimen in the Imperial Mineralogical Museum of Vienna,

                                                                     Fig. 5.

In the very same manner a solid crust or shell may be the result of pressure from

without, on the stratum most distant from the centre, in a lar^e globe of cosmic

matter. Pressure will elicit electric action, chemical action will ensue, and heat

and light be disengaged, sufficient to form all those combinations and compound
rocks, as they come now within our reach in aerolites, or meteoric stones and irons;

some of them in the shape of massive rocks of tufaceous structure, others becoming

granular in composition, some traversed by veins, others (^and particularly ii-ons)

having the character of being the products of veins containing fi-agments or im-

bedded crystals, as of olivine or chromite.

Pressiu-e on the surface depends upon the magnitude of the globe itself: while a

portion of matter weighing one pound upon our earth will press upon the smface

of it with the effect appertaining to one pound, it will only press with the effect of

^ths of one pound upon the surface of the moon, but with that of 28^ pounds upon

that of the sun. The same pressure which is produced in our planet by a crust of        I

25 miles, upon the moon vsdll only be produced by a crust of 1621 niUes ; upon the

sun by a crust of only ^ths of a mUe, or of only 4656 feet. Heat is then the result

of pressure. I may be permitted to quote here a passage fi-om the * Abstracts of the

Proceedings of the Geological Society of London,' No. 24, January 5, 1859, in
which Prof. Ramsay, communicating a paper by Mr. T. Steny Hunt, states, " The

author accepts the views of Babbage and Herschel as to the internal heat of the

earth lising through the sti-atified deposits, on account of the superficial accumula-

tion of sediments, metamorphosing the rocks submitted to its action, causing eai-th-

quakes and volcanic iiTuptions by the evolution of gases and vapours from chemical

reactions, and giving rise to disturbances of equilibrium over wide areas of elevation

of increase of thickness of deposits. The same must certainly be allowed also at

the veiy first, and when cosmic matter is in its most attenuated dust-like state.

   Pressui-e will take place only so long as there is no consolidation of matter.
Solid matter presses upon its support, but is steady within itself. The gi-adual

evolution of heat is confided to the hearth of pressure. What we observe of risLag

temperature as we descend is conducted heat from that hearth, where it is generated,

and from which streams of lava are forced up and volcanic action is developed.

   Suppose now a complete solid shell of a very large globe to have been formed,

and to be perfectly balanced, and sufiiciently steady to withstand any further ap-
proach towards the centi-e. But this shell is still filled with the original cosmic

matter, which itself may go on by a similar process to form a new shell concentric

Ato the former one, and developing heat again exactly as in the first instance.

new hearth of volcanic action is thus produced, while the original one becomes ex-
tinct. Then the possibility arises, that within this confined space, heat and the

expansion of gases might be brought to so high a degree of tension as to break the
shell with an actual explosion, as with hollow projectiles fidled with gunpowder,
laimching fragments of eveiy size in all possible directions, to travel on tor time

unmeasurable through cosmic space.

What is the reason of the great discrepancy in the density of the celestial bodies

of our solar system ? Does this depend only on the elementary substances of which

they consist, in a manner analogous to our own earth ; or is that difference founded,
Wepartially at least, in the progress of their formation ?
                                                              have the densities of

Mercury=6-71, of the Earth =-5-44, of Mars=5-15, of Venus=502, of the Moon

= 3-37, of the Sun=l-37, of Jupiter=l-29, of Neptune=l-21, of Uranus =0-98, of

Satm-n=0-75.

   It is well known that Olbera fii-st conceived the possibility of Ceres and Pallas

being fragments of a former larger body. When the asteroids Juno and Vesta had

been discovered, Lagrange* gave the numeric conditions of an exploding force under

which it might be possible that an exploding planet would yield fragments to be-

come comets, or, more properly speaking, to move in orbits of comets, direct or retro-

grade, elliptic, parabolic, or when more violent into hyperbolic orbits, to leave our

Nowsolar system altogether after the first perihelion.        he found that at the di-

stance of a hundred times the distance of the earth from the sim, an exploding force

wovdd suffice, giving an unpulse only from twelve to fifteen times greater than the

--velocity of a cannon-ball about 1400 feet in one second, which is about the same

as the velocity of a point in the equator in the diurnal revolution of om- earth.f

Although some of the considerations may appear too bold and extravagant, yet

I think I have nowhere supposed anything to take place which would not enter

within  the  compass  of well-known    physical  occurrences  upon  om- own  earth.                             I

believed it my duty to collect together in a short sketch the considerations which

had occuiTed to me, while I have for some time past had an opportimity of ex-

amining some facts, and of reporting on others, concerning meteorites.
   I beg leave to lay them before the public, wishing they might induce the friends

of scientific progress to take a still more lively interest both in observing facts and
in collecting materials (by publishing the former and preserving the latter in the
leading Museums) relative to these cmious celestial bodies, in order to advance our

ideas in these as yet comparatively obscure branches of science.

   Finally, I may be pei-mitted to recapitulate the entire series of steps in the pro-

gress of the formation of meteorites.

   t If it were assimied as a plausible hypothesis that lieaxenly bodies in the manner above
alluded to might fly into pieces, having their fragments transformed into planets, asteroids,
or aerolites, then one step further might bring in connexion with the same explosions also
the origin of comets. The solid crust of the sheU would supply more solid bodies, wliile
the aerial portion and the finest dust-like residue, being isolated in cosmic space, but still
acted upon by gravitation (in so far as it would not disperse altogether, having also received'
an impetus or launch in one direction), would assume the shape and nature of a comet

On the Quantity of the Acceleration of the Moon's Mean Motion, as indicated hy
   the Records of certain Ancient Eclipses. By the Eev. Edward Hincks, D.D.

    The question which the author proposed to discuss was whether the acceleration
 of the moon's mean motion relatively to the sun and stars was 12 or 13 seconds,
 multiplied by the square of the number of centm'ies from 1800, or only about two-
 thirds of that magnitude. The quantity assumed by M. Hansen in his lunar tables
 is 12" '18 ; and the Asti-onomer Royal has given his opinion that this is somewhat
 too small. The question is not to be decided by theory. Professor Adams has
 shown that the quantity which would be produced by gi-avity is far less than this,
 and less than is certainly indicated by observation ; and that, consequently, some
 other cause than gravity must have been in operation. Theory cannot determine
 what is due to this unknown cause ; and therefore the quantity of the acceleration
 can be determined by observiition alone.

    The observations on which the Astronomer Royal relied were solar eclipses, of
 which he believed that there were four, of which there were such authentic records

 as to determine with tolerable accuracy the quantity of the acceleration. He

 rejected the records of lunar eclipses, on accoimt of the want of precision which
 there must be in the obsei-vations. In the present paper the author eudeavoiu-ed
 to show that the four alleged eclipses of the sun, on which the Astronomer Royal
 relied, furnished no sufficient data for determining the acceleration ; and that, on
 the other hand, there were at least two of the lunar eclipses recorded by Ptolemy
  which afforded means of determining the quantity of the acceleration with tolerable
  accuracy, and which, if the author's calcidations were con-ect, proved that it did
 not much exceed 9".

     The four eclipses of the sim on which the Astronomer Royal relied were that of

 Agathocles ( -- 309, Aug. 14), as to the date of which there is no question, nor as to

  its totality where the fleet was ; the latitude in which the fleet was, is however,
  within certain limits, an indeterminate quantity, as is the hour when the eclipse

  began. WTiile therefore this eclipse affords conclusive evidence of the fact that

  the moon's motion formerly was less than it is now, it proves nothing as to the
  question now discussed, whether the acceleration was about 9" or between 12" and
  13". It is admitted that the former supposition would satisfy the requirements o

tte recoi-d ; and it is admitted that even 12" would be too great for these l-equire-"
inents, unless the motion of the node were altered also. This, eclipse ought ·.there-
fore, the author maintained, to be put out of the account. Whatever weiglit it

had was, he said, on his side of the balance. It was the same vsdth the eclipse of

Thales ( -- 584, May 28). Of this there were two records, real or supposed. There

is one preserved by Theon, which certainly applied to it ; and this is consistent

vriith, if it do not render necessaiy, the supposition that the acceleration is overrated

by Hansen. The other is the statement of Herodotus, that the eclipse which
terminated the Lydian war was that which was predicted by Thales ; in which case

the eclipse must have been total iu the eastern part of Asia Minor ; and this it could
not be if the acceleration were only 9". The author objected to this second record,

and charged the Astronomer Royal with arguing in a vicioas circle in respect to

it. He inferred that the acceleration was so great as he makes it, because this is

necessary to make the eclipse satisfy the statements of Herodotus ; while in defiance

of authentic chronology he makes the Lydian war to have terminated in 585 B.C.,

because the limar tables, assuming the acceleration to be thus great, give a track

of the shadow which would satisfy the condition of the eclipse which terminated

the war. Dr. Hincks, on the contraiy, maintained that if the acceleration were only
about 9", either the eclipse of 610 B.C. or that of 603 B.C. might be made to satisfy
the requirements of the eclipse which terminated the Lydian war ; the motion of
the node being suitably altered to a very moderate extent. The record of Theon

respecting the eclipse of 585 B.C. is that Thales predicted that an eclipse of the

sun would take place, and that accordingly there was an eclipse at the Hellespont.

The author inferred from this that the eclipse was not visible ia Greece, or at

Miletus or Sardis ; but that the shadow entered the north- western parts of Asia
Minor a little before simset, and left the earth before it reached the middle of the

peninsula. This would be in accordance with his views as to the quantity of the

acceleration. The third of the Astronomer Royal's eclipses is the so-called eclipse

of Larissa --( 556, May 19). He assumes that a cloud which was said to have

obscured the sun when this city was taken by the Persians, was in fact the moon

eclipsing him. The date of the transaction is not mentioned, nor the name of the

king of Persia who took the city. The Astronomer Royal has put together a

number of arbitrary hypotheses, all of which are required to be true ia order that

his conclusion should stand. The oiAyfact to which he appeals is that if Hansen's

tables were perfectly correct, the centre of the moon's shadow, which was very

fiarrow, would in that eclipse pass over Laiissa. If, however, the tables were

perfectly coiTect, as he admits himself, the eclipse of Agathocles would not have

He(jeen total in any possible position of his fleet.  is therefore obliged to

suppose that the tables required to be corrected both as to the acceleration, which

must be increased 0"-8, and as to the motion of the node ; and that in the eclipse
of Larissa these two corrections exactly neutralized one another ! The author of

the paper considered this to be almost infinitely improbable, the breadth of the

shadow being so small as it was. The remaining eclipse of the Astronomer Royal
was the so-called eclipse of Stiklastad. On the 31st of August, 1030, being Monday^
there was a total eclipse of the sun in Norway ; and Professor Hansteen pretends
that this eclipse caused the darkness which is said to have been observed when
the saint-king Olaf was killed in the battle of Stiklastad. But the chronicler

expressly states that this battle took place on Wednesday, the 29th of July, thirty-

three days before the eclipse. The week-day is particularly noticed, as well as the

month-date; and moreover it appears from the same chronicle that the eclipse

in the Orkney Islands, which took place on the 6th of August, 1263, was after the
day observed as St. Olaf's day, which was the day of the battle in which he was

killed. From this it is quite manifest that this eclipse is a figment of the Danish

Professor, and that no weight whatever should be allowed to any evidence that it

is supposed to furnish.

   Having disposed of these four solar eclipses, not one of which, as the author

contended, offers any reliable evidence that the moon's acceleration exceeded 9",

he proceeded to consider some lunar eclipses, observed at Babylon, the records of
which were preserved by Ptolemy. The Astronomer Royal had not taken these

into account ; but the author maintained that the true quantity of the acceleration

could be computed from them vtdth much greater accuracy than from the records
--24 REPORT 1861.

of the solar eclipses. He relied on the two eclipses of the je&t -- 719. In that of

March 8, it is recorded that the middle of the eclipse took place at Babylonian
midnight. As we know from the astronomical tablets found oy Mr. Layard that
the Babylonians measured the time from apparent noon by clepsydras, which ran
out in two hours, the time of midnight, being at the end of the sixth kazb, or
running out of the clepsydra, would be known with gi-eat precision, so that an
error of above a few minutes in the time of the middle of the eclipse is inadmissible.

An error of twelve minutes can scarcely be supposed possible. This, however, would

represent an errorof about325"in the mean elongation,or about0"-57in the coefficient
of^the acceleration ; while no error which we can suppose possible in the motion of
the node would sensibly affect the result. It appears from this, that the record of

this eclipse enables us to determine the quantity of the acceleration with far more
accuracy than do any of the records of solar eclipses. Dr. Hincks has calculated
the circumstances of this eclipse from Hansen's tables ; and without laying much
stress on his calculations, which required to be verified, he would state that the
middle of the eclipse took place about 11 p.m. Babylonian time, and that the

moon must have been completely out of the shadow before midnight. The other
eclipse was on the 1st of September ; and it is recorded that it began after the moon

had risen. This statement is one about which a mistake would be impossible.

And yet, according to the author's calculation from Hansen's tables, the moon was
more than two digits eclipsed when she rose at Babylon. But this is not all. He

argued that Ptolemy's reasoning respecting this eclipse implied that his records

stated that the eclipse did not commence till some time, probably half an hour,
after the moon had risen. The sun, he says, set at seven ; consequently the eclipse
began at half-past seven, Babylonian time. If then the author's calculation be
correct, there is an error of more than an hour in the time when this eclipse
commenced, which of course must be occasioned by Hansen's having overrated the
acceleration. The author concluded by saying that he did not expect or wish that
his calculations should be held conclusive ; but he wished that others should make
the calculations, and that these important data should not be ignored, aa they had

hitherto been.

Cases of Planetary Instability indicated by the appearance of Temporary

                          Stars. By Daniel Yaughajt.

In a paper which I sent to the British Association foitr years ago, I ascribed the

perpetmty of the sun's light to the combustion of ether collected fi-om space by his

attraction, and compressed at his sirrface to a density sufficiently great tor the play

of chemical forces. I showed that the brilliancy of liuninous meteors is the neces-

sary consequence of the great pressui-e which rapidly moving bodies impart to the

envelope of this luciferous fluid belonging to the earth, and that the dormant pho-

tospheres which it forms for dark central bodies, when traversed by worlds in the

last stage of existence, must give birth to a vast iUmnination, exhibiting to us the

pecidiar characters of the temporary stars. The main results of my subsequent re-

searches on the subject have been published in the ' London, Edinbm-gh, and Dublin

Philosophical Magazine ; ' and in two communications which appeared in the Num-

bers for December 1860, and April 1861, the more obvious cases of the instability of

satellites fi-om the reduced size of their orbits have been investigated, partly with

a view of tracing the com-se of great meteoric displays in the heavens. In these

I have supposed the central orb vastly superior to its attendant in mass and dimen-

sions                    but on examining  the consequences which  must ensue when the  dispropor-
                      ;

tion of temporally stars, without exceeding the limits of reasonable probability in

estimating the number of dai-k systems in our imiverse.

In these investigations the hypothesis of solidity, in the sense usually received,

should be abandoned. In very close proximity to a great central sphere, a satellite

as large as the earth could not be considered imyielding, though composed of the

strongest materials known ; nor could it deviate much fi-om the foi-m which it might

assume if reduced to a state of fluidity. In a very small orbit also, the disturbing

forces operating on the yielding mass would have the ultimate effect of bringing

the same point of its surface into pei-petual conjunction with the primary planet.

In the absence of any arrangement for this purpose, the action of the primaiy on

the protuberant solid or liquid matter which swells by its enormous tidal force on

the satellite, must constantly accelerate or retard the rotation of the latter, until it

is caused to keep exact trace with the orbital movement. Whilst the synchronism

confines the great tide-wave to a limited range, the tendency of the shortest dia-

meter to become the axis of rotation will gradually bring the equator into a coin-

cidence with the plane of the orbit ; and both causes woidd have the ultimate effect

of giving the body a permanent elongation at the same localities. If the eccentri-

city of the orbit were then sufficiently great to occasion high tides on its seas or

oscillation in its solid matter, the resulting deviation from a sphere will not reach

its highest limit until some time after the central distm-bance became most ener-
getic, while a coiTesponding interval must elapse between the periods when the

ellipticity and the distiurbing power sink to the lowest degree. It will readily

appear that such changes in the form of the satellite must cause it to feel a greater

amount of attractive force while retiring from the primary than while approaching

it ; and a constant diminution of the eccentricity of the orbit is an inevitable con-

sequence. Notwithstanding the small size of the four nearest moons of Saturn, it

is not impossible that commotions on their siu^ace may serve, in this way, to check

the increase of eccentricity which might be expected to arise fi'om the relation in

their periods of revolution.

As a veiy large satellite, revolving within the range of a great central disturb-

ance, must idtimately have its diiunal motion, the position of its axis, and the form

of its orbit arranged in the peculiar manner necessary for keeping the same point of

its surface always directed to the centre of the primary, the statical condition which

the equilibrium of its parts assumes, presents a more easy subject for accm-ate scien-

tific inquiry. In the April Number of the ' Philosophical Magazine,' I have shown

that a homogeneous fluid satellite, whose size is very small compared with that of

its orbit, would find repose in a form varying little from an ellipsoid, and that the

intensity of gravity on its surface would be almost exactly proportional to the nor-

mal con-esponding to each locality. It was also proved by the investigation, that

the equilibrium is not possible when more than f of the attraction along the major
axis is neutralized by the centrifugal force and the distm'bance emanating from the

primaiy. In a former article, the radius of the smallest circular orbit in which the

Rplanetary form could be preserved was estimated as nearly equal to 2-48    3  //--D

                                                                          *

  mTo cases of instability which may occur at any remote period the systems of

Jupiter and Satm-n, these results would apply, with tolerable accuracy, even veithout

coiTCctions for the variable density of the Dodies in their different parts. But were

the central and the subordinate world iu the same ratio as the earth and moon

with respect to mass and volume, whUe their linear dimensions were ten times as

great, the range of dangerous proximity would be a little wider than my estimate

indicates, and the consequences near the confines of this dangerous domain would

be much modified. The form of the lesser body would de\'iate considerably from

a true ellipsoid ; the disturbing forces miist be very imequal at both extremities of

the longest diameter ; and the equilibrium cannot "be equally secm-e at both locali-

ties. If, therefore, so large a satellite were introduced into the region of instability

by the resistance of a space-pervading medium, the dismemberment would be con-

fined to the side tiuned to the primary, and it would commence before weight en-

tirely disappeared at any part of the surface. If it were composed of a fiuid of

uniform density, a reduction of even less than sixty per cent, in the attraction at the

point neai-est to the central orb would give rise to a movement towards this point,

and cause it to assume such a character that it must be accelerated instead of oeing

Achecked by the resulting change of form.  body of small size, in such circum-

stances, must soon have its whole contents scattered into space, from its two pro-

minent extremities. In the present case, where the matter is pressed out only at

the place next the primaiy, the enlargement which necessaiily occm-s in the orbit

of the remaining mass lessens the distm'bance, and biings the dismembering action

to a close. The advantages for stability would also increase, as the large portion

of the satellite lavmched into space retii-ed far enough to make its attraction inap-

preciable. Accordingly a very large member of a dark system must close its mun-

number of paroxysmal convulsions, each burling forth an immense quantity of
matter, witb peculiarly farom-able conditions for sweeping close to the central
 sphere, and forming a host of blazing meteors to encu'cle his suiface.

    Investigations on the effect of the departing mass in causing instability by its

attraction, and of the opposite tendency of the expansion of the orbit, have led me

-- Vto estimate the amount separated by each catasti'ophe at ^ / ---, denoting the

Avolume of the satellite, its longest semidiameter, and C a constant, which may

be taken 8000 in case of a homogeneous fluid, but somewhat less when the body is
soUd. The influence of the opposing forces in limiting the range of the great rup-
tiu-e wUl diminish the loss which this expression woidd assign to a very large dis-
membei-ing body. From the relative magnitudes of the eaith and the moon, and
the relation observed between the members of physically double stars, it would not

be imreasonable to expect that central spheres 200,000 or 300,000 miles in dia-

meter may have worlds capable of exhibiting, diu^ing their last stage of existence,
a few himdi'ed of these temfic scenes, and sending forth on many of them more

meteorites than could be fonned from our entire globe. Of the periods inter^'ening
between each, no precise estimate can be given, but it must doubtless comprise

many centimes. On the first of these awful events, the meteoric light must be

confined to the vicinity of the plane in which the attendant moved, and from which
the fragments can deviate little ; but these will soon form a ring aroimd the primary,
and make the luciferous action disappear. The mass launched forth on every sub-
sequent paroxysm must move with terrific speed through the annular field of dis-
connected matter, scattering it in every dii-ection, and causing it to extend the me-
teoric exhibitions over a much greater part of the surface of the central orb.

   The pressm-e imparted to a fluid by a moving body is proportional to the cube of
the velocity, though the resistance to motion, being equal to the difference of the
pressiu-e on two opposite sides, varies according to a different law. Now, if attrac-
tion causes the space-pervading ether to become more dense in the \"icinity of the
earth's sm-face, the excess of density must be increased almost a thousand-fold by
the pressure of a meteorite passing through this ethereal atmosphere with the
greatest velocity with which a body moving in an ellipse around the sim can ap-
proach the earth. Regarding meteors as luminous in consequence of this compai'i-
son, it is evident that they must display their light with the utmost splendour, and
at the greatest elevations, on large spheres which exert the most powerful attrac-
tion on their surfaces. From the imperfect accounts which I have seen of Mr.
Hamngton's observations on September 1st, 18o0, 1 have concluded that the meteors
which he saw falling to the solar disc must have been self-limiinoiis about one
hundi'ed thousand miles above the boimdaiy of the great ocean of flame, \^^len
we consider the extraordinaiy brilliancy often attending the descent of these bodies
to the eai-th, and reject the extravagant idea of gigantic meteorites supposed to
escape into space after grazing or striking om- atmosphere, we find additional proofs
 of the existence of dormant photospheres ai'ound obsciu'e celestial orbs, and of the
relation between objects so disproportionate in size as a shooting and a temporary

star.

 (hi tlie Application of the Principle of tlie Consen^ation of Force to the mechanical

   explanation of the Correlation of Forces. By J. S. Stuaet Glexkie, M.A.

   The author's chief object was to show that the principle of the conservation
of force, with the facts of the correlation of forces, reqidred a new or modified con-
ception of matter. The piinciple of the conseiTation of force might be thus ex-
pressed : every motion is resisted, and produces a new motion, deteimined by the
conditions of such resistance. To this principle the conception of matter, as made
·up of hard inelastic particles in an elastic ether, seemed to be opposed. Matter was
rather to be conceived as made up of molecules, exerting mechanical pressure on

     Physical Considerations regarding the Possible Age of the Sun's Heat.

                         By Professor W. Thomson, F.R.S.

  The author prefaced his remarks by di-awing attention to some principles previously
established. It is a principle of iiTeversible action in natiu-e, that, " although me-

chanical energy is indestructible, there is a universal tendency to its dissipation,
which produces gradual augmentation and diffusion of heat, cessation of motion, and
exhaustion of potential energy, thi-ough the material universe." The result of this
would be a state of imiversal rest and death, if the universe were finite and left to

obey existing laws. But as no limit is known to the extent of matter, science

points rather to an endless progi-ess through an endless space, of action involving
the transformation of potential energy thi-ough palpable motion into heat, than to

a single finite mechanism, rimning down like a clock and stopping for ever. It is

also impossible to conceive either the beginning or the continuance of life without a

creating and oven'uling power. The author's object was to lay before the Section
an application of these general views to the discover}' of probable limits to the
periods of time, pas< anifufure, dimng which the sun can be reckoned on as a source
of heat and light. The subject was divided under two heads : 1. On the secular
cooling of the sun ; 2. On the origin and total amount of the sim's heat.

   In the first part it is shown that the sun is probably an incandescent liquid mass,
radiating away heat without any appreciable compensation by the influx of meteoric
matter. The rate at which heat is radiated from the sun has been measm-ed by

Herschel and Pouillet independently ; and, according to then- residts, the author

estimates that if the mean specific heat of the sim were the same as that of liquid
water, his temperature would be lowered by 1°'4 Centigrade annually. In con-
sideiiug what the sun's specific heat maj' actually be, the author first remarks that
there are excellent reasons for believing that his su.bstance is very much like the
eai-th's. For the last eight or nine years, Stokes's Principles of Solar and Stellar

 Chemistry have been taught in the public lectures on natiu'al philosophy in the
 University of Glasgow ; and it has been shown as a first result, that there certainly
 is sodivm in the sun's atmosphere. The recent application of these principles in the
 splendid researches of Bunsen and Kirchhoff (who made an independent discovery
 of Stokes's theory) has demonstrated with equal certainty that there are iron and

 manganese, and several of our other known metals, in the sun. The specific heat of
 each of these substances is less than the specific heat of water, which indeed
 exceeds that of every other known ten'estrial solid or liquid. It might therefore
 at first sight seem probable that the mean specific heat of the sun's whole substance
 is less, and veiy certain that it cannot be much greater, than that of water. But
 thermodynamic reasons, explained in the paper, lead to a very different conclusion,
 and make it probable that, on account of the enormous pressure which the sim's
 interior bears, his specific heat is more than ten times, although not more than
 10,000 times, that of liquid water. Hence it is probable that the sim cools by as
 much as 14° C. in some time more than 100 years, but less than 100,000 years.

    As to the sun's actual temperature at the present time, it is remarked that at his
 surface it cannot, as we have many reasons for believing, be incomparably higher
 than temperatures attainable artificially at the earth's surface. Among other rea-
 sons, it may be mentioned that he radiates heat from every square foot of his sur-

 face at only about 7000 horse-power. Coal burning at the rate of a little less than
 a pound per two seconds would generate the same amount ; and it is estimated
 (Rankine, 'Prime Movers,' p. 285, edit. 1859) that in the furnaces of locomotive

 engines, coal bums at from 1 lb. in 30 seconds to 1 lb. in 90 seconds per square foot
 of grate-bars. Hence heat is radiated from the sim at a rate not more than from

 fifteen to foi-ty-five times as high as that at which heat is generated on the grate-

 bars of a locomotive fm-nace, per equal areas.

    The interior temperature of the sun is probably far higher.than that at the sur-

 face, because conduction can play no sensible part in the transference of heat between
28 REPORT-- 1861.

tlie inner and outer portions of his mass, and there must be an approximate convec'

tive equilibrium of heat throughout  the whole                                          that is to say, the temperatures at
                                                                                     ;

difierent distances from the centre must be approximately those which any portion

of the substance, if carried from the centre to the surface, would acquire by expan-

sion without loss or gain of heat.

Pabt II. On the Origin and Total Amount of the Sun's Heat.

The Sim being, for reasons referred to above, assumed to be an incandescent

liquid now losing heat, the question naturally occurs, how did this heat originate ?

It is certain that it cannot have existed in the sim through an infinity of past time,

because as long as it has so existed it must have been suifering dissipation ; and the

fiiniteness of the sun precludes the supposition of an infinite primitive store of heat

in his body. The sim must thei-efore either have been created an active source of

heat at some time of not  immeasurable  antiquity by an overruling decree                                                                                                                               or the
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

heat which he has already radiated away, and that which he still possesses, must

have been acquired by some natural process following permanently established

laws. Without pronouncing the former supposition to be essentially incredible,

the author assumes that it may be safely said to be in the highest degree improba-

ble, if, as he believes to be the case, we can show the latter to be not contradictory

to known physical laws.

The author then reviews the meteoric theory of solar heat, and shows that, in the

form in which it was advocated by Helmholz*, it is adequate, and it is the only

theory consistent with natural laws which is adequate, to accoimt for the present

condition of the sim, and for radiation continued at a very slowly decreasing rate

during many millions of years past and future. But 7ieither this nor any other natu-

ral theory can account for solar radiation continuing at anythi/ig like the present rate

--for many hundred millions of years. The paper concludes as follows : " It seems

therefore, on the whole, most probable that the sun has not illuminated the earth

for 100,000,000 years, and almost certain that he has not done so for 500,000,000

years. As for the future, we may say with equal certainty that inhabitants of the

earth cannot continue to enjoy the light and heat essential to their life for many
million yeai's longer, imless new sources, now imknown to us, are prepared in the

gi'eat storehouse of Creation."

     On Photogj^ajaJik Micrometers. By Sir David Beewstee, K.H., F.R.S.

   When examining, several years ago, some microscopic photogi-aphs executed by

 Mr. Dancer, the celebrated optician of this city, the author was struck with the
 singular shai-pness and opacity of some of the lines in such of them as were copied
 from engravings. The idea occurred to him of obtaining photographically, by means
 of the camera, micrometrical scales, or systems of delicate lines, opake or transpa-
rent, and fitted both for astronomical and microscopical purposes. The suggestion
was published in the article "Micrometer" in the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Mr.
Dancer had succeeded in making photographic portraits on collodion so small that
they were wholly invisible to the naked eye, and 10,000 portraits might be intro-
duced into a square inch. The film of collodion upon which these photographs
were taken was so thin and transparent that it was invisible, and allowed objects to
be seen thi-ough it as distinctly as if it were the thinnest glass. If a system of
opake or transparent lines, therefore, was impressed upon collodictti or albumen
photogi-aphicaUy, when reduced to the minutest size from a system of large and
shai-ply-defined lines, we should have the most perfect micrometncal scale that could
be conceived. In the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for August 1861, Dr. Woods, of
Parsonstown, had suggested the constniction of photogi-aphic micrometers without
being aware of what had been published on the subject.

On the Compensation of Impressions moving over the Retina.
            By Sir David Brewstee, K.H., F.B.S.

The author stated that when, in railway travelling, they looked at the lines which

the stones or gravel or other objects formed in consequence of the durations of their

impressions on the retina, and quickly transferred the eye to the same lines further

back, where the velocity was slower, the stones or gi-avel or other objects would,

for an instant, be distinctly seen, just as rapidly revolving objects are seen in the

dark when they are illuminated by an electric ilash or the light of an exploded

Acopper cap.  similar, but not the same, phenomenon will be seen when we look

at the moving lines through a slit and quicMy look away from the slit, so that the

lines may be seen by indirect vision on a pai't of the retina not previously im-

pressed. This class of phenomena may be best studied with a rapidly revolving

disc, by quickly ti-ansferriag the eye from the lines on the marginal part of the disc

Whento those near the centre of rotation, where the velocity is less.  the mai--

ginal velocity is gi'eatest, the point of compensation is nearest the centi-e, as might

have been expected from the experiment in a railway carriage ; but what could

not, he thought, have been anticipated, was that the point of compensation was not

in the same radius as the point to which the eye was first directed. The author

explained this statement by means of a diagram which was exhibited. He had not

been able to see the point of compensation close to the centi-e of rotation, where it

doubtless must be, with a certain velocity, so that its locus must be in a curve.

On the Optical Study of the Retina. By Sir David Bkewsteh, K.H., F.R.S.

There were two structures in the retina (hexangular and quadrangular) that could

be exhibited by optical means, the one by the successive impulses of light, and the

other by the action of faint light entering the eye, or produced within it, either

from the duration of a luminous impression, or from a local pressm-e upon the retina.

The first of these structures was best seen by the light of a white cloud, through

the slits or apertures of a revolving disc, placed midway between its circumference

and its centre of rotation, in order to protect the eye fi'om light which did not pass

Whenthrough the slits.  the disc revolved rapidly the field of view exhibited

neither colour nor structure, but merely a diminution of light. When the velocity

had reached a certain point, the field of vision became yellowish white, then yellow

and bluish. Occasionally the yellow had the form of a rectangular cross, between

the branches of which were four dark spaces. With a diminished velocity the whole
field became unifonuly blue, and was now covered with the hexagonal pattern

formed by deep-black fines, the lines being darker at the place of the foramen cen-

trale. As there are no fewer than eight different layers in the retina, it was of great

importance to ascertain the functions which they individually perfoi-med in con-

veying visual impressions to the brain, and it was only by optical means that this

inquiry could be conducted. The anatomist had ably perfoimed his part with the

aid of the microscope, and it was probably from the improvement of this instrument

chiefly that we could expect any further discoveries, vmless the morbid anatomy of

the retina should connect certain imperfections of vision with the condition of cer-

tain layers of the membrane. When the eye was left in darkness, by the sudden

extinction of a light, there were several points at the margin of the retina which

retained the light longer than the rest. Ihere could be no doubt that these effects

were produced by structural differences. In the case of the foramen the difference

had been recognized by the anatomist, and was proved by the remarkable pheno-

menon of Haidinger's brushes, and by other optical facts, such as the instability and

Wesuperior brightness of oblique impressions on the retina.  had, consequently,

an optical principle which enabled us to explain the quadrangular structure he had

referred to. It was not improbable, when we looked at the complete structm-e of

the retina, and even of its individual layers, that the structure of each of them

might be exhibited optically.

         On Binocular Lustre. By Sir Davtd Bbewsteb, K.H., F.R.S.

   The author commenced hj stating that some years ago it was observed by Pro-
fessor Dove that when the nght and left eye figures of a pyramid, or other mathe-
30 REPORT-- 1861.

matical solid, the one drawn on a white, and the other on a dark gi'ound, were in-
serted in the stereoscope, the solid in relief appeared with a particular lustre. Prof.
Dove described the lustre as metallic ; and in another place, where he described the
two diagrams as di-awn, the one with white lines on a black ground, and the other
with black lines on a white gi'ound, he stated that the pyi'amid in relief " appears
lustrous, as made of gi'aphite." Other obsei-vers described the lustres dififerently,
some as resembling gi-oimd glass, and others as like paper darkened with a black-
lead pencil, while Professor Rood regarded it as "recalling the idea of highly
polished glass." In order to explain this phenomenon, Professor Dove remarked
" that in every case where a siu-face appeared lustrous, there was always a transpa-

rent, or ti-ansparent-refiecting stratum of much intensity, through which we see

another body. It is therefore externally reflected light in combination with inter-
nally reflected or dispersed light, whose combined action produced the idea of lustre.

This eflect," he elsewhere added, "we see produced when many watch-glasses are
laid in a heap, or when a plate of ti-ansparent mica or talc, when heated red-hot, is

separated into multitudes of thin layers, each of which, of inconceivable thinness,
is found to be highly ti-ansparent, while the entire plate assvmies the lusti-e of a

plate of silver." To these examples of lustre, produced by thin plates not in optical
contact, or if in actual contact, having difierent reflective powers, were to be added
the following pearls, mother-of-pearl, pearl-spar, and composite crystals of calca-
reous spar, and decomposed glass of all colours. The cause of these various kinds
of lusti-e, iind of that of metals, had always been well known, and when binoculai'
lustre attracted the attention of philosophers, it was natm'al to ascribe it to the
same cause. Professor Dove did this, and considered the dark surface in the one
picture as the dispersed light, and the white surface as the regulai-ly reflected light,

the dai-k surface beuig seen through the white sm-face. This theory of binocular

lusti'e, he had reason to believe, was not satisfactory. The phenomenon was first
obsened by himself in 1843, under conditions of different foiins than those under
which it was subsequently seen in the stereoscope. Having adverted to a paper

"On the knowledge of Distance given by Binocular Vision," published by himself

in 1844 in the ' Edinburgh Transactions,' he said that with his knowledge of the
phenomena he could not adopt Professor Dove's explanation of the lusti'e seen in
the stereoscope by the imion of figures on dai'k and white, or differently colored
surfaces. In order to test this explanation by other means, he combined surfaces
that had no geometrical figiu'es upon them, and he found that binocular lustre was

not produced. This experiment seemed decisive of the question. He was led to

infer from it that the lustre observed in the combination of right and left eye figures
of solids was not due to the rays from a dark surface passing through a lighter one
to the eye, but to the effect of the ej'es in combining the two stereoscopic figiires,
and to the dazzle occasioned by the alternating intensities of the two combined
tints, the impression of one of the tints sometimes disappearing and reappearing.

He refeiTed to an article published by Professor Rood, of Troy, on his (Sir David

Brewster's) " Theory of Lustre," and which he disavowed, not having adopted any

" theoiy of lusti-e." He had merely stai-ted an objection to Professor Dove's theory

of binocular lustre, and given an opinion regarding its cause ; and as the simple
experiment on which he founded that opinion had been made by others with a dif-
ferent result, he thought it right to re-examine the subject with the assistance of
other eyes than his own, and had obtained results which might be of use to those

who were disposed to study the subject more elaborately.
   Binocular lustre was a species of lustre sui generis. It was a physiological, not a

physical phenomenon, and had no I'elation whatever to those varieties of lustre
which arose from the combination of Lights reflected from the outer and inner sur-

faces of laminated, ti'ansparent, or translucent bodies. He assigned vaiious causes

Kfor the physiological character of the phenomenon, and then added, " binocular

lustre arises fi-om a physiological and not fi-om a physical cause, we must look for
this cause in the operations which take place in the eyes of the observer when

binocular lustre is distinctly seen. These operations are of two kinds. First, in
combining geometi-ical or other figures to represent solids whose parts are at dif-
ferent distances from the eye, the optic axes are in constant play, not only in vary-

ing the distance of their focus of convergence, to unite similar points at different

d'stauces in the two diagrams, but in maintaining the unity of the picture by

rapidly viewing every point of its surface. Secondly, when the two surfaces have

different shades or coloiu-s, the retina of one eye is constantly losing and recovering
the vision of one of them. Each optic nei-ve is conveying to the brain the sensa-
tions of a different tint or colour. The brain is therefore agitated sometimes with
one of these sensations and sometimes with the other, and sometimes with both of
them combined, and it is therefore not an imreasonable conclusion that, in the dazzle

produced by this struggle of flickeiing sensations, something like lustre may be

produced. In studying the subject of lustre there ai-e some facts deserving of atten-
tion. In a daguerreotype, for example, of two figm-es in black bronze with a high
metallic lustre, it is impossible by looking at either of the pictiu-es to tell the ma-

terials of which they are made. No lustre is visible ; but when the two equally

shaded pictm-es are combined in the stereoscope, the lustre and true character of

the material is instantly seen. Another insti-uctive example is seen in the stereo-
scopic representations of a boy blowing a soap-bubble. The lustre of the watery

sphere is not visible in either of the two pictures ; but when they are combined, it is
distinctly seen. In both these cases, and others of the same kind, tints of similar
intensity are combined ; and there is no gi-oimd fora ssimiing that the two surfaces

combined appear at different distances, and that the one is seen through the other,

as in Professor Dove's theory.

Observations upon the Production of Colour hy the Prism, the Passive Mental
   Effect or Instinct in comprehending the Enlargement of the Visual Angle, ami

  other Optical Phenomena. By J. Alexander Davies.

   The commimication was intended to show that the doctrine of the decomposition
of light is not the only possible explanation of colour, but that two causes may, in
the way of possibility, be assigned to its production, of which the other is, that the
rays receive certain affections or dispositions by their transit through a prism_ or
other media. It was not affii-med that the present doctrine, which of course im-

plies previous combination or composition, is not the probable one, but only that
the idea of its necessary exclusiveuess, as the only one which can philosophically

be maintained, is a philosophical error. The difficulty of imagining decomposition
in some cases, as, for example, when the solar rays pass through a piece of smoke-

blackened glass, was refen'ed to as affording some presumption for supposing that
the production of colour by the prism is not occasioned by decomposition, and this

especially when it is considered how difficult it is to conjecture how the prism

effects the disintegTation of the incident light. The equal difficulty appertaining
to the hj-pothesis of disposition was also allowed ; and it was shown that upon
either explanation it must be gi'anted that the incident rays pass to the second dyes

of the prism, and back again to the first, before they are decomposed, or colours
are otherwise produced, and that probably they arise from the backward transit of
the rays, which is probably a species of retrogression. The phenomenon, that only

the contours and internal lines and points of objects and pictures are coloured when

seen through a prism, was accounted for by supposing that the rays proceeding

from them are prevented fi'om being recomposed by reason of the disturbance of the
sun'ouuding colour, which is not affected when seen through a prism, because the
various rays are, by the law of chromatic aberration, united after being decomposed

by it. The comprehension of the visual angle, or the determination of the prolon-.
gation of the angular space, in eveiy case of reilexion and refi-action, was set down

either to passive mental action or instinct, and this on the gi-oimd of there not being

any physical bai-rier, and from the fact that single vision alone is sufficient to pro-

duce this effect.

The light proceeding from luminous objects was stated to be accompanied with

colour, and not colour per se : and as regards the intensity of colour, it was con-

cluded that, as an example, a thin mixture of Indian ink is caused either by the

very thin distiibution of black particles, or white or almost white ones, more or less

closely compacted ; supposing which to be the case, the mixture is darkened with

every' increase    in  their  compactness                                                   of which explanations the  former was con-,
                                                                                         ;

sidered to be the correct one.

The fact that black polished surfaces, however great the approximative perfec-
--S2 REPORT 1861.

tion of the polish, reflect very little light, was set down to some yet undiscorered

disturbance.

    The last question noticed was the apparent increase in the size of the sim and
moon when near and upon the horizon, which was illustrated by a description of
an experiment, which consists in looking at a ball suspended by a fine silken thread,
both when the external light does and does not fall upon the side next to the spec-
tator, in the latter of which cases the baU appears larger than it would if looked
upon in the hand ; from which it was concluded that this supposition arises from
its being supposed to be at a greater distance from the spectator than is really the
case, and this consequent upon its dullness ; and this explanation was applied to
the sun and moon when in the positions mentioned, as being at any rate one cause
of the phenomenon which may then be obsei-ved.

Presentations of Colour produced under novel conditions ; with their assumed

   relation to the received Theory of Light and Colour. By Thojias Eose.

   The author succeeded some years ago in perfecting a mechanical contrivance for
measming off flashes of artiflcial light, in due relation to the velocity of an inde-

pendent revolving disc.

This apparatus was originally designed for no higher pm-pose than showing the

ordinary, yet remarkable illusions of persistence of vision to a large company. Acci-

dent led to its employment in the illustration of phenomena of greater interest. It
was foimd that a disc charged with eight intensely black cu-cular spaces, equi-

distantly aiTanged around its circumference, presented some noticeable eflects when

subjected to the action of continuous daylight and intei-mittent aitificial light. After

repeated and carefid experiment, it was ascertained that if, whilst the disc is in

rapid revolution under a weak continuous daylight, flashes of artificial light are
thrown upon it in rapid and regidar succession, and at such intervals that the black

circidar spaces be held at apparent rest, several varieties of positive colour are seen.

The black spaces show an intense blue in the central parts, melting towards the inner

circumference into lighter blue, and towards the outer circiunference into gi-een ; and
they appear to lie upon a zone presenting intense orange in the centre, and lighter

orange and yellow at the inner and outer circimiferences. Other discs, in which the

black cii'cidar spaces vary in diameter and occupy lesser portions of the zones con-

taining them, were obsei-ved to give modified analogous eflects. There was an
evident law in the action. The colours were obviously dependent on the relative
amounts of black space and white surface in the zones. As the black spaces were

reduced, the colom-s ranged from dark blue to light gi-een, and the sepai-ating inter-

vals of whiteness, of greater or lesser width, took all tints, from intense orange to

the faintest yellow.

The author deemed it worthy of especial remark, that aU these presentations of

colour were produced at pleasure under uniform conditions of action, and that they

were so sti-ongly and unequivocally expressed as to afiect all eyes alike. This he
thought made sepai'ation between them and other colour-eflects that are merely

physiological phenomena.
--He was thus led to

_
                      assimie that  his  experiments  touched  the question  7s light

simple or compound ? and after much thought, it did appear to him that the result-

ing phenomena found consistent explanation in the assimied homogeneity of light,

but presented difliculties when brought into relation with the received doctrine.
   By a variety of experiments, earned on over a period of more than six years, Mr.

Rose had been brought to favour the idea that what we name coloiu', is only the

various afiections of the optic nerve by a greater or a lesser quantity of light radiating

from a focal point in an maperfect reflector. It is obviously impossible on this oc-

casion to ti-ace the steps by which he was led to form this conclusion. All that can

be permitted, is to state briefly, and in general, the application of his views to the

mphenomena under consideration. When the disc is rapid revolution, the weak

continuous daylight keeps it constantly before the eye, but the intermittent light

Nowpresents the black spaces continually in the same areas.    the black spaces are

assximed to have no pai-t in the phenomena, except as absolute negations of light,
and aU the effects are referred to the distribution over an entire zone of the light of

those portions of the zone not occupied by the black spaces. The nebulous ring
       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTION'S.                             33

produced by rotation is assumed to be liglit so distributed in relation to space as
to produce blueness ; and when the intermittent light brings the black spaces to
apparent rest, they give back to the eye no part of the flash, but simply present this

diffused light of the zone. On the other hand, the white intervals between the

black spaces receive the flash and give it back, so that they reflect light in such re-
lation to area as is necessary for the presentation of orange. The black spaces being
circidar, the white intervals between them are wider at the outer and inner circum-
ference of the zone than in the centre ; and hence the diffused light varies in cha-
racter, and manifests itself in the negations as blue, light blue, and green ; and in
the intervals as dai'k orange, light orange, and yellow.

       Method of interpreting some of the Phenomena of Light.

                             Tlie Cliromascope, and what it reveals.

                      By JoHK Smith, M.A., Perth Academy.

   The author said that he had described at the Meeting at Oxford certain experi-
ments exhibiting phenomena of colour, in order to elicit the opinion of philosophers
as to the cause of the colom's ; that the opinions then given, and those which he

mhas since met with have completely failed, his opinion, to meet the difficulties of

the question.

   The experiments he considered demonstrated the true physical conditions of the
two colours red and blue. If we take the expression "pressure in time," from
Nevrton, to mean the time of action of a vibration of light, then the interval v^oll
mean the time of reaction. If two forces impinge on the eye at the same time, and

if the one be at its maximum and the other at its minimum phase, these two forces

will represent the two physical conditions of the red and the blue rays ; for during
a pulsation the one will be always keeping up its velocity, while the velocity of the
other will be constantly diminishing. This the author illustrated by many exam-

ples, which were explained by appropriate diagrams and drawings, sho^ving how
the two forces were generated. He was also of opinion that the exhibition of colour
was the only evidence by which we could deduce that two such forces were in exist-
ence, but when once deduced could be verified by reversing the experiment.

    Tlie Prism and Cliromascope. By John SMini, M.A., Perth Academy.

   In this paper the author said, that having, as he considered, demonstrated in his
former paper, by experiments from the chromascope, the physical conditions of the
two extreme rays of the prism, he felt himself authorized to extend the discoveries
made by the chromascope to the illustration of the prism. That, by a legitimate
process of reasoning, he thought he was justified in concluding that the same law
was in operation in the chromascope and prism, although the processes were dif-
ferent. That this law explained, in the most simple manner possible, the cause of
the colour of thin plates of soap-bubbles and such other phenomena. That these
explanations all followed as logical inferences from the same law, without any
additional supposition or amendment. But that, in whatever light this theory
might be viewed, he considered that the experiments which he had described could

not be solved by any other theoiy, while they enabled him to give a very rational

explanation of the prism.

                                    On the Panoramic Lens.
By Thomas Sctton, B.A., Lecturer on Photography at King^s College, London.

The lenses commonly iised by photographers for taking views have this gTave

defect,_ viz. they include too narrow a field of view for a large and important class
of subjects. The author has invented a lens which remedies this defect, and pro-

duces an optical image which includes an angular field of 100° and upwards in

perfect focus to the extreme ends of the picture. This lens, which is an entirely
new optical instrument, unlike anything else, ho has called a "Panoramic lens,"

and will now describe.

                ^

Imagine, in tlie first place, a tliick spherical shell of glass, having its internal

spherical cavity filled with water ; and then, since the entii-e sphere is not required,

imagine a central zone of the glass shell removed, and its place supplied by the

J)rass mounting of the lens.

. Wheji the above arrangement is iitted with a central diaphragm having a small
centi'al apertm-e, it is evident that the pencils of light which pass through it must

be incident peroendicularly upon each of the four smfaces; therefore there is
mno such thing
                this lens as an oblique pencil, the errors due to oblique in-

cidence are completely avoided, and the image foiiued in eveiy part by direct

pencils.

   The glass shell, being a lens with concentric surfaces, acts as a concave or
diminishing lens, and has positive focal length ; while the eenti'al sphere of water
acts as a convex lens, and has negative focal lenglh. The- medimn" haxdng the
highest refractive and dispersive power is therefore made iiito a concave lens, while
the medium having the loivest refi^activ* and dispersive power, is made into a
convex lens. It is possible therefore to render thia compound achromatic by giving
a suitable radius to the inner giu-face of the shell, The investigation is extremely
simple, and the practical result very neat and convehient. It tmiis out that when
light flint-glass is used, the lens is achromatic when the inner radius of the shell is
about one-half the length of the outer radius. The combination may properly be

called a symmetrically achromatized sphere. It is a valuable property of a sphere

achromatized in this way, that its focal length is greatly increased, so that a large

picture can be taken with a tolerably small lens.
   The central diaphragm is another curious part of this instrument. It is evident

that if it were merely famished with a central circular hole, the sides of the picture

would be less illuminated than the centre. To meet this inconvenience the cen-
tral hole is made elliptical, and in front of it are placed two upright thin partitions,
radiating from the centre, and looking like the open wings of a butterfly. These
stop some of the light of the central pencil and make it cylindrical, and at the same
time they make the side pencils cylindrical also, and of the same diameter as

the eenti'al one. This simple contrivance answers perfectly ia equalizing the illu-

mination.

   The image of distant objects, formed by a panoramic lens, lies upon the surface
of a sphere which is concentric -ndth the lens. But the objects of an ordinary view
are not all distant ones, for the objects upon the gTOund are generally much nearer
to the lens than those upon the horizontal line. It is found, therefore, that the best
form of focusing-screen to meet the majority of cases which occur in practice, is
a part of a cylinder having the same centre a^ the lens, and including about 30°
below and 20° above the horizontal line. The panoramic picture therefore includes
about 100° in width and 50° in height. The iipright lines are straight, and

the perspective strictl}^ correct in all parts of the picture.

   Collodion pictiu'es are taken upon cui-ved glasses, and the negatives printed in a
curved printing-frame. The author has not found gi-eater practical difliculty in

working upon curved than upon flat glasses.

  A complete set of Panoramic Apparatus, manufactured by Mr. Thos. Ross, and

also a negative upon a curved glass, including about 100°, and a print from the same,

were sent for inspection.

  Microscopic Observations on the Structure of Metals. By H. H. Yivian,

   It is well known that silver and malleable iron, when newly broken, give a very

considerable reflexion of light fi'Om the fi-actm'e, and it has generally been under-
stood that the struetm'e was gi'anular, or composed of trystals, and that the re-

flexion of light was from their angles. On examining specimens of the above-named

metals with a microscope, however, the structm-e was discovered to be perfectly
porous or cellular, and the reflexion of light seen was from the inner surfaces of
the cells, which, though minute, were most brilliantly reflecting, especially when
newlj^ broken ; and when the metal was bent a little in one direction before break-
ing, thereby presenting the sides of the cells to the proper angle, the reflexion was
more fully seen than when the cells remained in their natural position. There is a
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  35

slight difierence in the size and number of the cells in different specimens of the
same metal, but the^ general resemblance is remarkably constant.

   In silver the form of the cell is somewhat oblong ; but the cell is larger than that
of copper or ii-on, and the system is more perfectly developed, that is, the internal
commimication from cell to cell appears to be more regular. The form of the cell
in copper is spherical ; but in some instances the cells seem to have pressed into the
domains of each other^ and their forms are therefore to some extent modified

thereby.

   Copper fi'om different -worts may differ a little in the diameter of the cells, and

consequently in the number contained, but the general range seems to be from 500
to 1000 in the linear inch. It shoidd be remarked that a specimen of the " best
select " copper is not any more dense and solid than a less pure metal, but, on the

--couti-aiy, the partitions between the cells are exceedingly thin so thin that there

appear to be minute openings from each one to its siuTOimding cells ; so that, as in
tlie silver, there is an internal communication through the entu-e mass.

   The cells in malleable iron are less regular in fomi and size, their inner surfaces
being jagged and uneven, and less biilliant than those of silver and copper ; but
the best fibrous iron seems to be equally free from angular crystals, and, like them,
shows a high degree of porosity.

    This cell-system is only developed internally in the metals ; the outer surfaces,
whether they have been in contact with the mould, or exposed to the atmosphere,
seem to be entirely destitute of them.

   In conclusion, the author regards it as highly probable that the malleability, as
well as the superiority of the above-named metals for conducting heat and electri-

city, may be owing to the perfection of their cellular aiTangement.

Observations on an Iris seen in Water, near Sunset. By J. J. Walkeb, M.A.

   In this commimication, which might be considered a sequel to and illusti-ation of
a paper read by the author at the Meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen

--and, more partially, of the secondary hyperbolic bow in the calm sheet of water

that of the rectangiilar hj-perhola.

                     On Sjpontanedus Terrestrial Galvanic Currents.
           By G. B. AiKT, M.A., D.C.L., F.B.S., Astronomer Royal.

   It being now a well-ascertained fact that spontaneous galvanic currents have in

several instances prevented the working of the telegraphic wires, the matter had

become one of so much importance that he had felt the necessity of steps being
taken to ascertain the exact cause of these disturbing influences. With this view

he had placed himself in communication with the telegraph companies, but had not

been able to obtain much accurate irifonnation from them, probably in consequence
of their ofiicers not ha^ang the leisure to note down obsei-vations on the effects pro-
duced on the telegTaphic wires. His wish was to have a constant registration of

the effect of these galvanic currents, at the Royal Observatory-, and he believed that
aU that was requu-ed to ascertain the causes of these spontaneous disturbances
was the laying down of an insidated wire. The Government had acceded to his
proposal, and he thought it his duty to state that on the part of the Board of Visi-
tors there was the most anxious wish expressed that the object he had in view
should be canied out. In aU. these instances the Government had acted towards

him with the greatest liberality. He (the President) had been in communication

                                                                                                       3*

witli Dr. Lamont, of Municli, and had received the following communications from

him on the subject, which he had thouglit it desirable to have printed for the mem-

bers of the Association, hut not necessarily for circulation amongst the public gene-
rallv. In one of his communications Dr. Lamont said, " Since the beginning of last
year I have been occupied with the investigation of the electric currents observed

m telegraph wires, and have obtained various results ; the most remarkable of which

is this, that electric cun-ents, or, as they may be more properly tanned, electric

waves, varying in direction and intensity, are constantly passing at the surface of
the earth, and that these waves con-espond perfectly with the variations of terres-
trial magnetism ; a wave directed from north to south producing an increase of

westerly declination, and a wave directed from east to west producing an increase
of horizontal force. I have employed wires of different lengths, and metallic discs

of difierent sizes and at difterent depths imdergTOund : in all cases the currents are

the same ; but their intensity depends on the size of the discs and the length of the

Awires, or rather, the distance at which the discs are placed from each other.

distance of 400 feet is sufficient if the discs are large enough. To show the effects
satisfactorily, the instruments must be of a peculiar construction ; ordinary galvano-

meters and magnetometers will not answer ; besides, various other conditions are

to be observed." And in another communication he stated that "The currents

observed in telegraph lines are due partly to the agency of chemical causes (oxida-

tion of the discs and other parts of circuits), partly to thermal causes (thermo-elec-
tricity, expansion, &c.), partly to terrestrial electricity. The variations of ten-estrial

electricity can only be obtained while the chemical and thennal causes remain con-

stant. The effect of the chemical causes changes very slowly ; the effect of the
thermal causes can be considered as constant only in calm weather, and for very
short intervals of time (say two or three minutes) when the wires are of moderate

length and suspended in the air, for longer intervals if underground. I believe that

lines above 1000 feet in length, if not underground, are of no use for the investiga-

tion of terrestrial electricity, because under all atmospheric circumstances the

disturbances produced by thermo-electric currents will be too great.'' It appeared

to him, with very gTeat submission to Dr. Lamont, that they need not necessarily

be bound or restricted to the limits which he suggested. As the disturbances
aflected long lines of telegrapliic wires, it appeared to him that their attention ought
more particularly to be directed to these long lines. He had brought the matter
before the Section with the view of inviting discussion upon it. He should be
happy to hear from the Section whether they were prepared to adopt the views of
Dr. Lamont or his o'^ii, which, he might say, he had now power from Government
to carry out. He should be glad if any gentleman would throw out suggestions upon
the subject. He would not bind himself to act upon them, but at the same time

they shoidd have his best attention.

On the Lcnvs of the Principal Inequalities, Solar and Liitiar, of Terrestrial
   Magnetic Force in the Horizontal Plane, from observations at the Royal Ob-
  servatory, Greenwich, ecctendincj from 1848 to 1857. By the Asteonomer

   Royal.

The author described shorth' the apparatus (being, in fact, that which was

introduced by Mr. Brooke) by which the continued registers of magnetic direction

and magnetic force are maintained. For the direction, a fi'eely suspended magnetic

bar carries a concave mirror that receives the light radiating from a fixed lamp,

and causes it to converge upon a revolving barrel covered \w\t\\ photographic paper
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      j

the oscillations of the magnet cause the spot of light to oscillate lengthwise along

the barrel ; and as it is easy to compute, from the dimensions of the apparatus, the

proportion that exists between a given s^ving of the magnet and the corresponding

motion of the spot of light, the oscillations of the magnet at all times of the day

may be measured accurately from the photographic record. Tliese oscillations may
be conceived as being produced by pertvu'bing magnetic forces in the E. and W.

direction, and tlie magnitudes of those perturbing forces may be inferred from the

magnitudes  of  angular  oscillation,  by  remarking  tliat  an  oscillation  of  1          corresponds

                                                                                          '

as changes in the magnitude of the horizontal directive force, the "bifilar
apparatus " is used : a magnetic bar is strained into a position at riglit angles to
the magnetic meridian, by suspension by means of two wires, which (their direc-
tions not being parallel) exert a torsion-force in opposition to the terrestrial mag-

netic force : when the ten-estrial force increases or diminishes, it overcomes in _a

greater degree or jdelds to the torsion-force ; and thus the changes of the magni-
tude of terrestrial directive force in the horizontal plane exhibit themselves by
oscillations of the bifilar magnet, which are photographically registered in the same

manner as those of the free magnet.

Having for every hour (or for any other intervals of time) the measiu-es of the

W.perturbing force in the E. and  direction, and of that in the N. and S. direction,

we can compound these two forces by the mechanical law of " composition of forces,"

and can assign the magnitude and the direction of the entire perturbing force (in the

horizontal plane) which acts upon the magnet.

   Upon discussing these pertmujiug forces, the following conclusions were obtained
   1. The mean annual diminution of western magnetic declination is about 7 '-9;
and the mean annual increase of horizontal directive force is about ^^th part of

the whole horizontal force.

2. The diurnal inequalities diminish gradually through the period 1848-1857

the proportion of their magnitude at the end of the period to that at the beginning
being about 3 : 5. This seems to show a general diminution of the power of the

Sim.

   3. The diurnal inequalities are greater in summer than in winter, in the propor-

tion of 5 : 3 nearly.

  4. When the means for the 24 hours of the day are taken, the westerly declina-

tion is increased in summer, and the horizontal force is diminished, in a greater
degree than corresponds to uniform change according to the law of conclusion

No. 1.

   5. "VMien we form a curve by moans of polar coordinates, drawing, from a zero

point, lines in the direction of the perturbing force acting upon the north end of the

magnet at every hour of the day, and with length proportional to the magnitude of
that force at every hour (as derived from the mean of all the observations at each
hour), an elliptical curve is produced, greatly extended in the direction of S.W.

(which point corresponds to the distiu-bing force at 1 p.m.), and much less extended

in other directions.

   6. The great distui'bance of the magnet occurs therefore when the sim is nearly

vertical on the North Atlantic Ocean, and is directed towards the point to which

he is nearly vertical.

7. Combining this conclusion with conclusions Nos. 3 and 4, the Astronomer

Royal expressed himself as fully persuaded that the diurnal changes at Greenwich

are produced by the attraction of the North Atlantic Ocean, when the sun radiates

strongly upon it, for the north end of the needle ; the attraction of the continent
of Africa, when the sun shines upon it, being in comparison very small.

8. The curve mentioned in No. 5 has some distortions of singular character cor-

discussed for discovery of the pertu^rbatious following the law of the lunar positions

with respect to the meridian. The general result appeared to be that, twice in

every lunar day, there is a force directed towards Hudson's Bay. Tiiere are some

anomalies in the partial results ; and the Astronomer Royal expressed himself as

not very confident on the accuracy of the law, and not very distinct in his views of

the explanation. The form of the general result bears a strong analogy with that

of Tides of the Sea.

    On the Formation of Standards of Electrical Quantity and Resistance^
                   By Latimer Clark and Sir Charles Bright.

   The object of this paper was to point out the desirability of the estabrshment of
a set of standards of electrical measurement, and to ask the aid and authority of the
British Association in introducing such standards into pi'actical use. Four stand-
ards or units were considered necessary.

   2. The unit of absolute electrical quantity, or of static electricity.
   3. The unit of electrical cm-rent, which should be foi-med by the combination of
the imit of quantity with time. Such, for example, as the flow of a unit of elec-

order to adapt the system to the wants of practical telegraphists.

On the Deposit of Metals from the Negative Terminal of an Induction Coil
  during the Electrical Discharge in Vacuo. By J. P. Gtassiot, F.B.8.

When the electric discharges by an induction coil are made from platinum ^vires

hermetically sealed in a vacuxmi tube as usually constiiicted, the wire which is

attached to the negative terminal of the coil shortly assmnes the appearance of

being con-oded : this arises from veiy minute particles of the metal having been

disintegi-ated and separated fi'om the wii-e, which particles are deposited or. the
Keides of the tube in a lateral dii'ection.
                                             the vnres are protected within the va-

cuum by being covered with glass tubing open at the end, but extending about one-

eighth of an inch beyond the wii-e, it is the iaside of this tubing that becomes coated

with metal : but, exclusive of this lateral action, a portion of the negative discharge

will be obsei-ved to obti-ude from the glass tubing iu the fonn of a limiinous brush j
this luminosity is very sensibly aflected by a magnet, and can in this manner be

made to impinge on difl'erent parts of the vacuiun tube, and wherever it is thus

impinged heat is always evolved. The above phenomenon of the deflection of the

negative discharge was described in a paper commimicated by me to the Eoyal

Society; and as I was subsequently desirous to examine with greater accuracy the

nature* of the deposit thus obtained from the negative tenninal, and pai-ticularly if it

coidd be obtained in the same manner fi-om other metals than platinum, I had an ap-

pai-atus constructed in which the discharge coidd be dii-ected on slips of glass : the

apparatus was also so constructed that wu-es of difl'erent metals could be inserted,

and in this manner I succeeded in obtaining deposits of the following metals, gold,

silver, copper, platinum, zinc, iron, tin, lead (brass), magnesiiun, tellm-iimi, bis-

muth, cadmium, and antimony : for many of these I was indebted to Mr.Matthiessen,

who fm-nished them to me in a pm-e state. With gold, silver, platinum, tin, and.

bismuth, the deposit would take place in the state as now exhibited in about twenty-

four hom-s' action ; if the discharges were continued, the deposit became denser

and, as will be observed, in one or two instances the centre is crystalline. With

reflected light a large sm-face exhibits the lusti-e of the metal ; with ti-ansmitted

--light the outer portion is transpai'ent, sho'wTng the peculiar colom* of the metals as

gold, gi-een; silver, bluish purole; platinum and tin, blackish grey. Telluriimi, with,

the exception of antimonj^, I found disintegi-ated more freely than the other metals,

while ii-on and magnesiimi were the most diflicidt; the deposit of the latter is

scarcely perceptible. With aluminiimi wires I could not obtain any deposit after

forty-eight hoiu-s' constant action ; on one occasion I observed a faint ti-ace on the

glass, but in repeating the experiment ^vith another wire no sign of any deposit coidd

be obtained. Under the microscope the thin layer or deposit of metal is not resolved
into any fonn, but appears as a mere film on the sm-face of the glass. From a brass

ware tenninal there was not any separation of the original metak. I had a tube

consti-ucted with two wires, both protected by glass tubing ; a long slip of glass was

+ --inserted, so that the discharges fi-om the and the temiinals of the coU could

be made with protected wii-es imder the same conditions. The wii-es were of gold.

The usual deposit took place at the negative ; but after twenty-four hom-s' constant

+action not the slightest indication of any deposit fi-om the wire coidd be obsen-ed.

With antimony a veiy peculiar eflect was obtained: instead of the metal being

deposited in a cii-cular foi-m, it spread nearly all over the glass and on the sides of

the vacuum tube. I repeated the experiment by inserting slips of glass of suflicient

length to reach beyond the tenninals. Two of these glasses are on the table, and,'

+if examined, it will be seen that the discharge has apparently repelled the deposit

as it formed fi-om the negative wii-e, leaving- the space somewhat analogous to the*

dark band which appears in the luminous stratified dischai-ge. Whatever may be

the cause ttf the difference in the action of the electrical discharge between the posi-
tive and the negative, the disruption of the metal in the latter is merely mechanical;
the minute particles are disrupted by the force of the discharge, which at the nega-
tive meets with resistance, and which resistance, imder certain conditions,is attended

with considerable heating effects ; for if the vdres are thin, the negative invariably

fuses, whether the discharges are made in air or in vacuo.

On a Probable Cause of the Diurnal Variation of Magnetic Dip and Declina-

                               tion. Bif Professor HenisT)sst, F.R.S.

   The author called attention to the researches of Mr. Faraday relative to atmo-
spheric magnetism, whereby it appears that vai'iations in the density and tempe-
ratm-e of oxygen ai-e always accompanied bj' corresponding variations in its mag-
netic properties. Variations in temperature of oiu: atmosphere may occur not
only horizontally, but vertically, and they may occur not only between colimins
of great extent, but even among extremely small portions of air. This ques-
tion had been already submitted to the consideration of the Section in 1858 by
Professor Hennessy, and an account of his experiments is contained in the volume

published for that year. He had shown that certain abnormal serrations in the
thermometrical curve which occur in May and June, and generally_ dm-ing the

months of greatest simshine, as exhibited 'by the photographical register kept at
the Eadcliffe Observatory, ai-e explicable by the convection of minute ciurents of
air. Thus the summer months of greatest simshine con-espond with the period of
greatest inequality of temperature between small atmospheric masses. But the
same months are also those dm-ing which dim-nal magnetic variation is greatest.

The hours of maximum magnetic deviation correspond with the hours of greatest

thermometiical serration. This result appeai-s not only from the facts disclosed by
Sabine and Hansteen, but also from the facts disclosed in the paper just communi-

cated by the Astronomer Royal.

        On Permanent Thermo-Electric Currents in Circuits of one Metal,

                                           Bij Fleeming Jexkin.

'' In the com-se of some thermo-electrical experunents, I was led to examine the
effect of various distributions of heat in circuits formed by one metal. I verified
the conclusion arrived at by Professor Magnus, that no distribution or movement
of heat in a continuous and homogeneous piece of metal will produce a current of
electricity. I also repeated, with some variations, the experiments of Seebeck and
Mao-nus, which show that if one end of a wire be heated, the other remaining cold,
a momentary or transient ciUTent of electi-icity will be developed when contact is
suddenly made between the hot and cold ends ; the du-ection of the cun-ent de-
pending on the metal employed. I foimd that I could obtain permanent currents
in the same direction from each metal, if I simply looped the two ends of the wire
together and heated one of the two loops ; and, moreover, that the cun-ent was
usually much greater when there was a loose contact between the two wires, than
when the two loops were tightly di-awn together. It is to these currents, due to
loose contact between a hot and cold wii-e of the same metal, that I wish to direct

the attent'on of the Section.

   I will first shortly describe the apparatus used, and the experiments which
showed the existence and importance of these cmTents, and I will then endeavour
to repeat some of the experiments before you. I used a retlecting galvanometer of

the fomi constructed by Professor W. Thomson of Glasgow. A. very light mirror,

attached to a very small mao;net hung inside the galvanometer coil, reflects the
light of a lamp upon a scale about two feet ofi". Very small deflections of the mag-
net are distinctly shown by the movement of the reflected spot of light, while the
slio-ht inertia of" the moving parts has great advantages when rapidly varying cur-

Arents are to be observ^ed. common spirit-lamp was used to heat the wires, which

were fi-om 0-02 in. to 0-05 in. in diameter.

   When two pieces of similar cojjper wire are connected with a galvanometer, and

the end of one wii-e is heated, a momentary current flows from the hot wire across
the joint to the cold one whenever th-ey are suddenly brought in contact. While
--40                                                             »
                               REPORT 1861,

repeatiug tliis experiment, due to Seebeck and Magnus, I found that if tlie two ends

of two such copper -v^ares (being equally oxidized and annealed) were looped toge-

ther and held tightly in contact, little or no current could be observed when one of
the loops was heated in the flame ; but when the hot and cold loops were separated,

--I observed a momentary current in the same direction as that produced when the

hot and cold wire were s\xA(\.erAy joined i. e. from heat to cold across the joint.

myThis fact, accidentally discovered, excited  attention, and led me to consider

what the acts of making and breaking contact could possibly have in conunon. I re-
flected that when two wires are approachmg or receding, they equally pass through

points at every possible distance (within limits) one from the other. Thus I thought

that the relative distance between the two wires might be the pecidiarity which,
being common to the two acts, might produce similar effects in each case. 1 there-

fore tried the effect of a loose contact between the two wires, resting the one wire

veiy lightly on the other, instead of pressing or pulling the two together ; a per-
manent cm'rent was at once produced, so strong as to hold the deflecting magnet of

the galvanometer against its limiting steps. I then introduced resistance cods into the

mycircuit for the pimpose of reducing the deflection, but to  sm-jirise it was not imtil

I had added a resistance equal to that of 2000 miles of the Red Sea cable, or about

1000 miles of the common No. 16 copper, that I reduced the deflections within the

range of my galvanometer.

 --The current could be maintained through this resistance for twenty minutes at

a time not perfectly constant indeed, but not wavering more than was inevitable

from the vai-jing pressure given by the hand to the two wires. The current was

etrongest when one end of the wires was white-hot, the other being dark red.

I varied the experiment in many ways, using different galvanometers and differ-
Aent copper wires, but always -svith one result.
                                                  tight contact gave a barely sen-

sible ciuTcnt ; a loose contact gave a current which could be maintained permanently

--equal to that which would be produced through a similar resistance by the eighth

or tenth part of a Daniell's coil, a strength suflicient to signal through a cable to

America, if ever one be laid.

I next tried the same experiment with iron wires. Analogous residts were ob-

tained, but with one remarkable difference, namely, that the direction of the cm-

rent was from cold to hot across the joint, instead of from hot to cold as in copper:

moreover, a very sensible current was always observed in iron even when the two

loops were firmly held together; it seems possible that this effect is only a residue

of the effect caused by a loose contact, the hard oxide of iron precluding a perfect

metallic contact between the loops. The effect is increased at least fivefold when

a loose contact is made.

   The maximmn electromotive force to be obtained from iron is about one-twen-

tieth that given by copper, and acts in the opposite direction.

Platinmn gives no current ^'ith tight contacts ; with loose contacts a weak cur-

rent ffows in the same du-ection as that given by copper. I must here warn any

one disposed to repeat these experiments, that the resistance of the loose contact is

itself considerable; and if the whole circuit, including the galvanometer, be of small

resistance, the strongest deflection will be obtained with comparatively tight con-

tacts; for although the electromotive force is increased by loosening the contact,

the total resistance of the current may be increased in a still higher proportion,

and the strength of the ciuTent will then diminish. This effect is exactly analogous

to the well-kno-wn fact in voltaic electiicity ; for by the addition of small cells in

series to a battery with large sinfoce, the strength of the cun-ent may be reduced if

the total resistance of the circuit be small, but will be increased if the total resist-

ance be large. Thus the eflects of loose contacts are best seen on a sensitive gal-

vanometer with a large resistance in circuit.

   These phenomena may apparently be due to a thermo-electric absorption of heat

at the joint, or to a chemical efiect in one of the wires, the air or oxide acting as

an electrolyte. The opposite direction of the current in iron and copper, however,

gives a reason for believing that chemical action is not the cause of the current.

The decided effect obtained with platinum is another argimient for this belief It

is moreover well established that any variation in the molecular structiu-e of a

metal causes one part to become thermo-electrically positive or negative with respect

to the other ; thus thermo-electric couples can be made of hai'd and soft wire of one

metal, or of crystals arranj^ed axially and eq^uatorially, the current being then sup-

Nowported by the i?'eltier absorption and evolution of heat.  discontinuity is the

greatest possible change which can occiu- in the molecular structui-e, and it there-

fore appears not improbable that the cuiTents due to loose contacts, or in other

--words to discontinuity, may be referred to the same cause. as the currents due to

varying temper or to crystalline structure, that is to say, to absorjDtion of heat

where the change of structure occurs, heat being evolved in other parts of the cir-
cuit at a lower temperatui-e. I hope soon to decide this question and others by

further experiments in various media, with definite pressiu'es at definite tempe-

ratures.

  When various metals are combined, striking effects are produced, the sti-ength

of the common thermo-electric current from the joint being often increased fifty or
a hundred fold when loose contacts are substituted for tight contacts. The direc-

tion of the ciurent is also frequently reversed.

   The results of these combinations are necessarily complicated, and require further

experiment and analysis before publication. In the ordinaiy thermo-electric battery

made from pairs of dissimilar metals, a very small proportion of the heat commu-
nicated to the joint is converted into electricity, which is therefore obtained from
them at a great disadvantage. But considering the comparatively great intensity
of the currents produced when loose contacts are adopted, it seems possible that by
their means a considerable part of the heat used may be absorbed in the production

of electricity, which woidd in that case be more cheaply obtained from heat, than

directly from chemical action.

   It is needless to allude to the consequences which would ensue should a cheap
source of electricity be discovered ; but without anticipating such important con-

sequences from the discoveiy of the loose contact cun-ents, they certainly seem a
fit subject for further investigation. Meanwhile it is interesting to consider how,

when two wires are tightly joined, the lieat given them by the flame travels but a

few inches slowly along them, producing all its sensible effects on objects in the

immediate neighbom-hood ; whereas when those wires are moved asunder to an
almost imperceptible distance, that same heat may in an instant be flashed as elec-
tricity through thousands of miles, reappearing distributed once more in the form

of heat abnost sunultaneously in every part of the whole circuit.

 On the Secular Changes of Terrestrial Magnetism, and their Connexion with
   Disturbances. By the Eev. H. Lloyd, D.D., D.C.L., F.B.S., M.B.I.A.

   Of the various changes to which the dii-ection and intensity of the earth's mag-
netic force are subject, unquestionably the most mysterious are those which, from
their analogy to the slower changes of the solar system, have been denominated

secular. No one has, as yet, ofl'ered even a plausible conjecture in explanation of
these phenomena; while, on the other hand, it has been felt by all who have

studied them, that their causes lie so deep, and are so closely connected with the
hidden nature of the force itself, that the knowledge of them would, in all proba-
bility, imlock most of the secrets of terrestrial magnetism. For these reasons, any
attempt, however imperfect, to add to our knowledge of the laws which govern
them will probably be received with indulgence by magneticians.

   It has long been known that, in addition to the changes which pass through their
whole cycle of values in a day, or in a year, and which are thence called periodic,

the magnetic elements at a given place are subject to changes of another kind,
which continue for a long time in the same du-ection. It has been generally sup-
posed that, for a limited number of years, the rate of these changes at any given
place was either uniform, or else uniformly accelerated or retarded; so that they
could be mathematically represented by a fonnula consisting at most of two terms,
one of which was proportional to the time (measured from some certain epoch),
and another to its square. In other words, it has been supposed that the 7nean
yearly values of the magnetic elements were subject to no Jluctuations oi minor

period.

    This view, so far at least as concerns the secular changes of the inclination, has

been completely disproved by Professor Hansteen. From the long and accurate
series of observations of this element made by himself at Christiania for more than

--42 REPORT 1861.

 thirty years, Professor Hansteen has inferred that its progressive change from year
 to year sometimes increases, and at other times diminishes, retm-ning to its former
 value in a limited time ; and that, to represent it algebraically, it was necessary
 to add to its expression a term proportional to sin mt, t being the time reckoned
 from a particular epoch. In other words, the mean yearly value of the inclination
is subject, according to Professor Hansteen, to s, periodicalfluctuation, whose length
 is 11| years, and which accordingly resembles the periods which have been ascer-
 tained to exist in the magnetical changes. Correctmg for the progressive change,

the inclination was foimd to be a maximum in 1828, 1840, and 1851, and a mini-

mum in 1823, 1834, 1845, and 1856.

   From a comparison of the Makerstoun observations with those made at other
places, ]Mr. Broim has arrived at a similar conclusion with respect to all the mag-

netic elements ; and he has pointed out the fact that the periodical changes of their
mean yearly values arc connected with the decennial period in the magnetic dis-

turbances.

    These important conclusions are fully confirmed by the Dublin observations^
Assuming that the inclination decreases proportionally to the time, and comparing
the results calciilated according to this hypothesis -with those actually observed, I
have found that the differences clearly indicate a cyclical or periodic change.
Applying the method of least squares to the observed results, the inclination at
Dublin will be given, on the former supposition, by the formula

                                            61=70° 2r-95-2'-76x«,

n being the number of the year reckoned from 1850. The values of the inclination
calculated by this formula, as well as the differences between them and the observed

results, ai-e given in the following Table :

diflerences of the two. These latter show, very clearly, the existence of a cycle.

The maximum occurs in the year 1844, and the minimum in the year 1848.

   There can therefore he no douht of the existence of a connexion between the
cycles in the mean yearly values of the magnetic elenients, and the disturbance
cycle. It is worthy of remark, however, that the epochs of greatest and least
declination precede those of greatest and least distiu'bance, while the corresponding
epochs for the horizontal intensity /o/fo«« them.

On an Electric Resistance Thermometer for ohserving Temperatures at inacces~

sible situations. Bij C. "W. Siemens.

   The Philosophical Magazine for January 1861 describes a method which I had
had occasion to resort to for ascertaining the temperatui-e of the interior of a mass

of electi'ic telegraph cable suspected of spontaneous generation of heat. Coils of

copper of platinum wire, of known resistances, were placed between the layers of
cable while coiling it, and leading wires conducted to an observatory. The tem-
perature of the cable could at any time be ascertained by measiu-ing the actual
resistances of these coils by means of a Wheatstone's bridge arrangement, and
comparing the residts with the resistances of the same coils at a standard tempe-
rature. The electric resistance of a copper or well-annealed platinimi wire, increasing
in a very uniform ratio with increase of temperatiu-e, enabled me to detei-mine the

latter with a remarkable degree of accui-acy.

In endeavouring to simplify the arrangement, I have succeeded in dispensing

entirely with the Wheatstone's bridge, and, in fact, in reducing the observation to

the mere reading of an ordinary mercm'y thermometer.

The apparatus consists of a differential galvanometer, and of a bath of water or

oil, the temperature of which can be changed at will by opening one or other of

two cocks, one supplying cold and the other hot liquid, an ovei-flow pipe being
Aprovided to prevent accmnidation.
                                    battery of from fom- to eight cells is pro-

vided, besides a nimiber of coils, each consisting of a certain length of thin insidated

platinum wire enclosed in a sealed metal tube. These coils ha^^ng been carefuUy

adjusted, in the first instance, to ofier an equal resistance at a fixed temperature,

are connected with insulated copper leading wires, of comparatively large sectional

arcs, the ends of which are brought to the binding screws of the apparatus, to be

inserted, when required, in a circuit including the batteiy and one side of the difier-

ential galvanometer.

   These "thermometer coils" are deposited at the places whose temperatiu*es have
to be observed, excepting one which is reserved for comparison with the others.
This last-mentioned coil, connected by means of its leading wires so as to form an
electxic cu'ctiit with the battery and the other side of the differential galvanometer,
is immersed in the bath before mentioned. This latter coil is enclosed in a sealed
auricular chamber formed by an internal and external tube of copper or brass, which
on being immersed immediately communicates the temperature of the bath to the

coil.

   It is evident that if the temperature of the bath be the same as that of the place
where the thermometer coil under examination is deposited, the divided battery
currents will meet, on each side, an equal resistance, and passing through the two

helices of the difierential galvanometer in opposite directions, will produce no visible
effect upon the needle.

   If, however, the temperatures of these coils shoidd be unequal, the needle will be
deflected by the preponderance of cmi-ent in the cooler half of the divided circuit,
showing by the direction of its deflection whether cold or hot liquid should be
added to the bath to establish equilibrium of ciurents.

  When this equilibrium is obtained, the temperature of the bath is observed by

means of an ordinary mercury thermometer, and must necessarily be identical with
the temperatm-e at the distant stations where the coil under examination is de-

posited.

   By di\dding the thermometer coils into two portions, the apparatus is rendered

applicable for observing wider ranges of temperatine than can be attained directly

by the mercuiy thermometer, and in this modified form it may be used for pyrome-

trical purposes.

   The employment of equal and undivided coils in measuring ordinary tempe-
ratures is, however, no^ only the more simple aiTangement but it has the advan-

tage in its favour that the accuracy of the observation does not depend upon a
imifonn rate of variation of the resistance. The heat generated in the coils by the
passage of the electric currents employed, atfecting the two coils equally, is also

completely compensated in using eq^ual coUs.

   The late extensive conilagrations of hemp and other warehouses have suggested
to me the idea of applying this method for detecting in such stores any spontaneous
generation of heat. It also appears to me applicable in meteorological and other
scientific observations where uiaxunum and minimum thermometers are at present

used.

On the Effect jproducecl on the Dtviation of the Compass hy the Length and
   Arramjement of the Compass Needles; and on a New Mode of Correcting
   the Quadrantal Deviation. By Aechibald Smith, M.A., F.B.S. ; and F. J.

   Evans, B.N., Supenntetident of the Compass Department of Her Majesty's
   Navy.

   This was the substance of a paper lately read to the Royal Society, and about to
appear in the forthcoming volume of the Philosophical Transactions. The follow-
ing is a summary of the results obtained.

   In correcting the de\-iations of a ship's compass in the usual way by magnets

and soft iron, if it is necessary to bring the correctors so ne^s the compass, and if
the needle is of such a length that its length bears a considerable proportion to
the distance of the correctors, an error is introduced which cannot be corrected in

the usual way. When caused by magnets, tliis eiTor is sextantal ; when by soft

ii'on, it is octantal. Mr. Evans, however, obseiTed that this error did not arise
when, instead of a single needle compass, an Acbniralty standard compass was used.
In this compass, instead of one needle there are four, arranged two and two at

--angles of 15° and 45° on each side of the central line an arrangement adopted

long ago in order to prevent the tcabhUng motion which a single needle card baa
when distm-bed. And. on submitting the matter to calculation, it appeared that the
error in question was wholly corrected when, instead of one needle in the central
line, there were two needles each at angles of 30° on each side of the central line,
and four needles placed as in the Admnalty compass ; the term involving the error

-- --having as a factor cos 3a in the first case, and cos -^ in the second, where a

and /3 are the distances of the needles from the central line. It is therefore re-
commended strongly that all corrected compass cards should be constructed in
this way.

   The second part of the communication was a new mode of correcting the qua-

drantal deviation. In all ships, with a very few exceptional cases, this error is posi-

tive. It may be corrected by cjiiuders of soft iron placed on each side of the com-
pass; but when it is large, there are great practical difiiculties in making the

correction. It had been long ago observed by the late Capt. Johnson, R.N., that
when two compasses are arranged as in the double binacle compass, they produce
on each other a considerable deviation, being in fact a negative quadrantal deviation
and accordino-ly this arrangement had been prohibited in the Navy. It, however,
occurred to Mr. Evans to apply this arrangement to correct the usual positive
quadrantal deviation, and one pair of the compasses of H.M.S. Warrior are cor-
rected in this manner. In this case likewise the needles should be arranged in the

way above described.

       BemarTcs on H.M.S. Warrior's Compasses. By P. J. Evans, B.N.

   It may be considered interesting to the Meeting, as supplementary to the paper

read by Mr. Archibald Smith, to receive a brief notice on the magnetism of the
 first of the great iron wai'-ships of the day, the ' Warrior,' and of the disposition

 of her compasses.
    There is but little novelty in the arrangement of those on the upper deck,

 excepting that it has been deemed desu-able to fiunish two standard compasses,
 from the unavoidable proximity of the after one to a new featui-e which from the

the neighbom-hood of the steeling-wheel.

  --The magnetic character of the ship, as developed by the two compasses before
--the rifle-tower was fixed is quite in accordance with the received principles as

due to the direction of the ship's head in building with reference to the magnetic
:peridian. The foremost compass, which is about ^rd of the ship's length from the

bow, had on the 10th of August last a maximum deviation of 16°, and the fifter
compass, wliich is about J-rd of the ship's length from the stern, a maximum deviation

of 31°, the sliip being built within .3° of the magnetic meridian (head N. 3° E.), and
the points of no de^-iation consequently at north and south. The deviation of the
after-compass had lessened 6° on the 24th of August, at which date the casing of
tlie iron rifle-tower had commenced.

,, But it is not to these points I wovdd now chiefly direct your attention, but to

certain necessities arising from the novel structm'e of the ship, demanding, in so

far as the .compasses are concerned, serious attention.

' In the fighting ships of what now may be tenned a past generation, we did not seek
for or expect invulnerability. In 1861 we demand nothing less, and " more iron " is
the ciy. It is clear from these new conditions that one compass at least, on which
the ultimate safety of the ship may depend, should be equally protected fi-oni the

fire of the enemy, in the event, which would most likely happen, of everything
Standing on the upper deck being swept away by the fire of the enemy.

   For the management of the ' WaiTior ' under this probable contingency, an addi-
tional steering-wheel has been fitted within the great armour-protected space on
the main deck : this space I need scarcely infomi you is cut off from the ends of
the vessel by massive iron bulk-heads. \\'^e are thus obliged, without reference
to choice of position, to place a compass near this steering-wheel on the main deck,
and suiTounded by iron of massive character on every side, and above as well as

below.

   Under these circimistances we coidd not but expect deviations of an exaggerated

amount, and particiUarly, from the large amoimt of horizontally placed iron from
the two iron decks and their beams, a large quadrantal deviation.
'· From the few obseiTations I have been enabled to make, owing to the constant
progress of the fittings, this quadi-antal deviation on the main deck is about 12°,
nearly ti-ebling in value quantities I have had to deal with in the other iron ships
of the Royal Na\y.

. It must be familiar to those who have practically dealt with the subject of cor-

recting ship's compasses by the antagonistic influences of magnets and soft iron,-
that 12° of quadrantal deviation is an enonnous amount to deal with ; and that
the emploj-ment of soft iron coiTectors which might be usefully emjiloyed in the
smaller values, becomes open to grave objections for the larger ones.

    I have adopted for the ' Warrior's ' main-deck conijiass the plan therefore alluded
to by Mr. A. Smith, namely the compass cards on I\Ir. Smith s plan, and two com-
passes so placed close together as to destaroy by their mutual action this 12° of
quadrantal deviation, and correcting the polar magnet or semicu'cular deviation
by owe system of magnets placed in a vertical plane below, and in a central line
between the two compasses, so that both are equally coiTected at the same time.

At the time of my observations this semicircular deviation was 3^ points, or nearly

40° at the maximmu.
   I venture to hope that we have by this method overcome the more serious diffi-

culties of disembarrassing the mifortimate compass, which is now so tortured in its

action by the never-ending intiX)duction of iron of all shapes, sizes, and quality
aroimd it ; but I feel that imceasing vigilance is more than ever requii-ed in watching
the compass imder these conditions, and that the subtle agencies of the forces we.
employ will elude the control of imskilled hands.

    The greatest difficulties I have experienced in making certain preliminary expe-
riments, and what must happen practically in dealing with large compass devia-
tions, are those due to delicacy of manipulation and workmanship : for example, the
lubber lines of the compasses must be placed exactly parallel, and exactly in the

fore-and-aft line of the sliip ; the centres of the compasses must be exactly in a
line at right angles to the head of the ship ; the adjusting magnets must follow the

same accuracy of an-angement ; and we are thus day by day approaching to the
necessity of being forced to expend on an instrument, so common, but so valuable,
and which imfortimately seamen in general, and I may venture to add, iron ship-

builders in particular, often ti-eat so lightly, the same rigid accuracy of fittings and

attention that are requh-ed in the more delicate instnmients of the observatoiy. I

may add that ^vithul the last few days I have been iuformed that the steering
compasses of ' La Glou-e' (the ' Warrior ' of France) are placed within a similar rifle-
tower on the upper deck. I am further infonned by M. Darondeau, who holds

mywith respect to the French Imperial Navj' a somewhat analogous position to

own in the Royal Navy of this coimtiy, that this is an unadvisable arrangement.

' In concluding these brief remarks, I cannot but convey to the Meeting the deep

debt that the seamen of all nations owe to the President for his long and patient
investigation on theu' behalf, of the management of the mariners compass imder
difficulties; to him we are indebted for the firet practical rules on the subject; and
however opinions may have varied -as to the uses of con-ecting magnets imder the

old condition of things, there can be no. doubt that in, the case of the '.Warrior's,'

main-deck compass, this system' in its main features becomes an absolute necessity-.'

Qn the Photographic Records (jlven at the Keiv Observatory of the great Mag-
' netic Storm of the end of August and beginning of September 1859. By.

   B. Stewaet, A.m.

   The author remarked that the tendency of this great magnetic storm was to
decrease the horizontal and vertical components of the earth's force, and that the

disturbing force came in a wave, the period of which was seven hours. He con-

trasted this lengthened period with that of earth-currents, which is only a few
minutes, and supposed that the change in the earth's magnetism is due to the abso-
lute amount of a disturbing force, which is of a fluctuating character, and of which
the fluctuations produce the earth- ciuTents and Aurora JBorealis, which are thus
regarded as secondary discharges.

On the Amount of the direct Magnetic Effect of the Sun or Moon on Instruments
       at the Earth's Surface. By G. JoiorsToifE SioifET, M.A., F.R.S.

In the Philosophical Magazine for March 1858, Dr. Lloyd showed that the

observed disturbances of the magnetic needle, depending on the hours of lunar and

solar time, follow laws inconsistent with their being due to the direct magnetic attrac-

tion of the moon or sim. Hence it might be too hastily concluded, from the absence

of observed eff'ects following the proper laws, that these luminai-ies are not magnetic.

The design of Mr. Stoney's commimication was to show that, though as highly mag-

netized as the eaith, then- direct eflects wovdd be almost inappreciable.

The maximum moment which the moon could impress on the needle was first

Dand needle, and the interval between their centi-es. It follows from this that we

may substitute for the moon a globe a meti-e in diameter of equally magnetized

materials, and placed at such a distance as to subtend at the needle an angle equal

to the greatest apparent diameter of the moon as seen from the earth's surface. By

applying to the problem in this foi-m the wonderful numerical data elicited from

the observations by the genius of Gauss in his memoir on the magnetism of the
eai'th, the gi-eatest d'rect disturbance which the moon could produce, on the liypo-

thesis of its being of materials as magnetic bulk for bulk as the earth, proves to be

less than a tenth of a second of space on the declination-needle, and less than a

twenty-seventh on the dipping-needle.

   The observations with wliich these should be compared have been made at
several stations. The principal part of the observed lunar-diurnal variation con-

sists of a tenn depending on twice the lunar hom'-angle, but there is also a small term

containing the simple hour-angle. This latter is the one which, as Dr. Lloyd ha^
                                                                               A;

shown, the direct action of the moon would affect, and General Sabine has deter-
mined its values at several stations scattered over the earth, in calculating- the for-

mula3 which best represent the observations. These values range (see the Introduc-
tion to the second volume of the ' St. Helena Observations ') from 0"'48 up to 2"'04.
There is therefore no gi-oimd for presuming, from the minuteness of the coefficient,

that the moon is not of as magnetic, or even much more magnetic materials than

the earth.

   If the comparison with the earth be made mass for mass instead of bulk for bulk,
the above disturbances must be reduced in the ratio of the moon's density to that of

the earth, that is, to about two-thirds of the values already given.

   The same method of course applies equally to the sim ; and whether his magnetic
moment be conceived to be gi-eater than that of the earth in proportion to his mass,

or in proportion to his bulk, his maximum influence will be even less than that
assigned above to the moon ; for he never attains an apparent size as great aa the
maximum of the moon, and his density is only about half that of the moon.

On Liglitning Figures, chiefly with reference to those Tree-like or Mamijted
   Figures sometimes found on the Bodies of Men and Animals that have been
   struck by Lightning. By Charles Tomlinson, King's College, London.

Professor Poey has collected a number of such cases into a memoir, entitled

* The Photographic Effects of Lightning,' a second edition of which has been pub-

--lished at Paris during the present year. One of these cases is the following :

boy climbed a tree to steal a bird's-nest ; the tree was struck by lightning, and the

boy thrown to the ground ; on his breast the image of the tree, with the bird and

nest on one of its branches, appeared very plainly. Mr. Tomlinson explains such

cases by referring to breath-figures, and showed that when the discharge of a

Leyden jar is received on a pane of glass, it bums away a portion of the organic

film which covers all matter exposed to the air, so that when breathed upon, the

moisture condenses in unbroken streams along the lines where the electricity has

passed ; while on the other parts of the surface the moisture condenses in minute

globides, so that on holding the glass up to the light the figure is distinctly seen,

80 long as the breath remains on the plate. This figm-e resembles a tree, bare of

leaves, and might (as the President of the Section afterwards remarked with

reference to the diagrams exhibited) be taken for any tree in the world. In this

figure we have a broad and somewhat rippled line of least resistance or path of the

principal dischai-ge, branching off from which ai'e numerous ramifications, fi-om

each of which proceed large twigs, and from these smaller ones of great delicacy

and beauty. It can be proved that when the discharge of a Leyden jar is thus
received on glass, the jar sends out feelers in all dhections to prepare the way for

the line of least resistance, and this being accurately marked out, the principal

discharge takes place. In some cases the discharge bifurcates and even trifurcates.

If the glass presents too much resistance, the breath-figure consists of thpse feelers

only ; and these are the lines which produce the sensation of cobwebs being drawn

over the face, which seamen sometimes describe as the forerunners of the ship

being struck. The main trunk is hollow, and resembles in its structm'e the siliceous

tubes known as Fulgurites. Mr. Tomlinson took this figure to be typical of the

lightning discharge which strikes terrestrial objects, and objected to the stereotyped

zigzag by which a stroke of lightning is generally represented. His theory is, that

when a tree-like impression is found on the body of a man or animal struck by

lightning, a portion of the fiery hand of the lightning itself has passed over the

Victim and left its mark. Several cases of this kind were described and discussed

but allowance must be made for the imagination of bystanders, which leads them

to see in these ramified impressions "an exact portrait of the tree; " the blotches
are taken for leaves, for a bird or bird's-nest, &c., as the case may be. Cases were
also examined in which these tree-like impressions were referred by medical men

to ecchymosis                                                        other cases, in which  the  impressions  of a  horseshoe,  of a nail, of
                                                                  ;

a metal comb, of coins, &c., were found on the persons of the victims, were

explained on the principle of the transfer of metallic particles from one conductor

to another, as illustrated by the well-known experiment of M. Fusinieri. Mr.
Tomlinson rejected the photo-electric theory, by which M. Poey attempted to

account for the production of all these figures.

            On the Causes of the Phenomena of Cyclones. By I. Ashe.

On the supposed Connexion hettoeen Meteorological Phenomena and the Varia-
  tions of the EartKs Magnetic Force. By John Allan Broun, F.B.S., Di-
   rector of the Trevandrum Observatory.

  In the ' Comptes Rendus ' of the French Academy of Sciences for May 6, 1861,
a note appeared by Father Secchi, Director of the Observatory of the Roman Col-

lege, on the connexion between meteorological phenomena and the vai'iation of

the earth's magnetic force, as shown by the bifilar magnetometer at Rome. The

results of Father Secchi's discussions appeared to me extraordinary; for though

no careful examination of the subject has been published, yet the question had

been examined by myself during the years that I directed the Makerstoim Observa-

toiy, both while observing, when during two years, on an average of eight hours

daily, my eye was upon all the magnetical and meteorological variations, and after-

wards whUe discussing the observations. In the latter case the simple method of

"rojecting the simidtaneous magnetical and meteorological observations employed

Iy Father Secchi was also used, and had any slightly marked relation existed it
Awoidd have been perceived at once.
                                           particular discussion was made to de-

termine if the variations of the external temperature had any effect on the bifilar

observations, and the conclusion was that they had none *.

It would appear, however, fi-om Father Secchi's discussion of the Roman obser-

vations, that the horizontal force of the earth's magnetism increases when the

north wind blows and the barometer rises at Rome, while it diminishes when the

south wind blows and the barometer falls ; the two latter phenomena, it is well

known, are connected with each other and with a rising temperatm-e, while the

two fonner are connected with a falling temperature. Had the vaiiations of in-

tensity to be explained been small, this last relation would have been taken by

me as an explanation of the whole discussion, especially as the teniperature-co-

efiicient indicated for the Roman bifilar (xto^fot of the whole horizontal force t)

is less than half the average coefficient for bifilar magnets. Observations imcoiTected,

or insufficiently corrected for temperature would give just such results as those

obtained from the Roman bifilar. The variations of force it seems, however, are
too large to be explained by any such error X ; and my own unpublished negative

conclusions, however satisfactory to myself, cannot be accepted by others in oppo-

sition to results so positive as those contained in the paper imder consideration.

I have iu consequence undertaken a special discussion of the observations of the

bifilar magnetometer and of the anemometer made at Makerstoun in Scotland in the

year 1844 §.

Before entering upon this discussion I should allude to an objection to Father

Secchi's results, which exists in the conclusions of a paper by me on the horizontal

force of the earth's magnetism, lately printed in the * Transactions of the Royal

Society of Edinburgh' ||. From this paper it appears that generally, when the
daily mean horizontal force diminishes at one point on the earth's surface,^ it

diminishes simultaneously, and by nearly the same amount, at all other places (the

discussion  includes  stations  between    55° north  and 42° south latitude)                                                                                      the same

holds for an increase of force. The earth therefore appears to act as a whole, as a

great magnet, the increase or diminution being in proportion to the iutensity at the
given point. This fact is wholly opposed to an explanation which would attribute
an increase or diminution of force to a purely local phenomenon, such as the direc-

tion of the wind, as may easily be shown ; for if, while relating the du-ection of
the wind at Makerstoun to the horizontal force at the same place, we also relate it

to the horizontal force at some other place where the direction of the wind is
known to be very different, and if the same, or nearly the same, result is obtained

for the horizontal force at both places, we may be satisfied that the result, tchatever
it may he, is unconnected with the direction of the wind. For this end I have
chosen as a second station Singapore, nearly on the equator (1° W/ N. lat., &" 45TM

long, east of Greenwich).

   In a discussion of this kind, where the results obtained by others are disputed, it is

necessary to state distinctly the methods employed : this I shall now do. The hourly

observations of the bifilar magnetometers at Makeratouu and Singapore for 1844

having been connected for temperature *, the monthly mean con-esponding to each

day in the year (that is, having that day for its middle point) was obtained for each
place : this monthly mean includes the annual and secular change corresponding
to the given day ; and wten it has been compared with the coiresponding daily

--mean, the difference (+ if the daily mean were the greater, if the lesser) vdll

depend upon other causes. These differences were obtained for each day of 1844
on which observations were made. The approximate mean direction and mean
pressure of the wind (in pounds on the square foot of surface) at Makerstoun were

also obtained for each day of the year. In order to render the results comparable
with those obtained by Father Secchi, the winds were included in the four heads,

South, East, North, and West ; the days of intennediate directions (as N.W.)
being entered under the two principal heads (as north and west) with half weights

--only. For purposes of comparison the winds were separated into frv\'o classes that of

weak winds (daily mean pressure less than | of a poimd), and that of strong winds
 (daily mean pressure I of a poimd and upwards).

   The follovdng are the results of this discussion ; and that a comparison may be
made at once with those of the Roman Observatory, I shall fh-st give the number
of days for which the horizontal force Was greater or less than the mean for each

 of the four winds.

obtained in the above discussions are very small, the greatest being less than -77*^^

of one scale division of the Roman bifilar ; in a discussion of a sufficiently large

series they would probably entirely vanish. Should, however, further proof be re-
quired that the local meteorological phenomena are unconnected with the varia-
tions of horizontal intensity, it will be found in plate 28 of the paper previously
cited on the horizontal intensity of the earth's magnetism, where it will be seen
that the simidtaneous variations of daily mean horizontal force from hour to hour
at six places (Makerstoim in Scotland, the Cape of Good Hope, Trevandnim, South

India, Singapore, Hobarton, Van Diemen Island, and Toronto in Canada) resemble
each other, excepting in minute points and in cases of marked disturbance.

   I should not tenninate the examination of this question without noticing that
Father Secchi has concluded that magnetic disturbances are predictors of change

of weather at Rome ; he has indeed given mmibers which seem to show that there are
most disturbances when the wind blows from the south at Rome. When it is re-

membered that magnetic distm-bances are experienced simultaneously on all parts

of the earth's surface, any connexion between them and the weather at Rome must

appear extraordinary. For the strict examination, however, of this question, there
are, however, several points to be taken into consideration, some of which it seems

to me have been omitted by Father Secchi. First, we should decide on the defi-
nition of a day of distm'bance ; second, we should determine how many of these

days occm- in a fixed number (say a hundi-ed) during which each wiud blew ; third,
it should be remembered that the gi-eatest mean magnetic disturbance occurs near
the epochs of the equinoxes, and that the amount for perihelion is greater than for
aphelion. As for these periods of the year, each place has a prevailing wind ; the
discussion for each place would give the greatest number of disturbances for these
winds: thus at Makerstoun the prevailing winds were south-westerly, and the
greatest number of distmrbances occun-ed in 1844 with south and west winds ; at

Rome the prevailing wind at these epochs is perhaps southerly, and at Singapore it

is probably westerly.

   As I am unacquainted with the observations made in the observatory of the
Roman College, I shall not venture to offer any suggestion as to the remarkable

results which have been deduced fr-om them.

    On the Law of Universal Storms. By William Danson, of Liverpool.

    In the course of his paper the author insisted on the soundness of the general

views now prevalent regarding the theory of storms, and the regularity of their occur-

--rence. He endeavoured to show that it was something like infatuation on the

part of seafaring men ignoring these laws captains and commanders, as well as

ordinary seamen, included. It was a point of the greatest importance, at the pre-
sent time, to consider whether it was not desirable to adopt improved means to

secure the safety of traffic, leaving the rapidity of ships' passages as a secondary con-

sideration; and supposing this view of the subject to be recognized, it was worthy
of being taken into account whether the theory of what was now nautically known
as the " great circle sailing " was not the best to be adopted by our mercantile ma-

rine captains generally. He knew that, in insisting upon the practical utility of
recognizing this theory, he was in antagonism with the views of many experienced

seamen, whose opinions were entitled to profound respect; but he nevertheless
ventured to suggest, as worthy of the notice of the nautical public generally, that,
in a great number of eases, ships whose captains had followed the " gi-eat circle
sailing " theory had arrived safely at their respective destinations ; whilst other
vessels, imder the same thenuometrical and barometrical circumstances, but whose
conmianders had adhered to the hitherto received ideas of practical nautical navi-
gation, had met with a fate which it would only be painfid to dilate upon. Re-
ferring to the length and duration of storms, he said that the residts of several of
the most complete calculations indicated that, in the instances of stoniis, several of
them had extended as far as 3600 miles, and travelled at the rate of 50 miles an
hour, and that this is a moderate calcidarion.

Remarks on the Temperature of the Earth's Crust, as exhibited by Thermome-
    trical Returns obtained during the sinking of the Deep Mine at Bul-infield.

   By Wm. Fairbairn, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S.

   It is now more than ten years since a series of experiments were commenced to

detennine the temperature at which certain substances became fluid under pressure.
These experiments had reference to the density, point of fusion, and conducting
power of the materials of which the earth's crust is composed, and were prosecuted
with a view to the solution of some questions regai'ding the probable thickness of

the earth's crust. Contemporaneously with these, we were fortimate in being able

to ascertain by a series of direct experiments, imder very favoui-able circumstances,
the increase of temperature to a limited depth in the earth's crust itself These
observations were obtained by means of thermometers placed in bore-holes at various

mdepths, during the sinking of one of the deepest mines England, namely, the coal-

mine belonging to F. D. Astley, Esq., at DuMnfield. The bore-holes were driven
to such a depth as to be unaffected by the temperature of the air in the shaft,
and the thermometers were left in them'for periods varying from half an hour to two

hours. It is very difficidt to arrive at accurate data on the subject of the increase

of temperature as we descend from the surface to depths within our reach. On the

contrary, the experiments hitherto made, give unfortunately somewhat conflicting
results, and even in the same mine the rate of increase of temperature is by no means
imiform. This is shown very clearly in the results obtained by Mr. Astley. It is
scarcely probable, however, that the temperature in the mine shaft influenced the
results, and we must therefore seek the cause of this irregularity in the varying con-
ducting power of the rocks, ai'ising from different density, and different degrees of

moisture in the strata.

   The following Table gives the general results obtained dming the sinking of the
shaft, which extended over a period of nearly ten years, from Jime 1849 to March

1859.

231 and 685 yards, we have an increase of temperature from 57|° to 75^°, or 17|°

PFahrenheit. That is a mean increase of in 76'8 feet. This rate of increase is not

widely different from that observed by other authorities. Walferdin and Ai-ago

Pfound an increase of in 59 feet in the artesian well at Grenelle. At the salt-

works at Rehme, where an artesian well penetrates to a depth of 760 yards, or

Prather more than the Dukinfield mine, the increase is in 54'7 feet. MM. De la

Rive and Marcet found an increase of 1° in 51 feet at Geneva. Other experiment?

Phave given an increase of in 71 feet. In one respect the observations in the

Dukintield mine are peculiarly interesting, as they give the temperature in various
descriptions of rock, which appear to prove what has hitherto oeen partially sus-
pected, that the conducting powers of the rocks exercise a considerable intluenca

on the temperature of the steata. If we add to this the influence of the percolation
of water, we shall probably have a sufficient explanation of the m-egid.arities observed

in the experiments.

   In Plate I. I have attempted to show graphically the results obtained between'
the depths of 231 and 717 yards. The dots show the actual experimental relation
of depth and temperature, arranged on a Table in which the ordinates are depths
and the abscissfe temperatures. Between these I have dravra a line of variable cur-

vature, which expresses approximately the rate of increase in descending through
the strata. Between the extreme indications which are most reliable I have drawn

Pa straight line which expresses the theoretical rate, or a uniform increase of in

76'8 feet of vertical descent. Beside the Table of curves is placed a section of the

strata of the mine.

   Since the above was wi-itten I have received from Dukinfield some further expe-
riments obtained in the same manner in a new shaft which is being sunk at no
great distance from the former. The following Table gives the results of these

experiments :

as to whetlier this increase contiuues to mucli greater depths than we have yet

Eeneti'ated, as observations upon this point are still imperfect. But, assuming as an
 ypothesk that the law which prevails to a depth of 700 yards continues to operate

at still gi-eater depths, we arrive at the conclusion that at a depth of less than two

and a lialf miles the temperature of boiling water would be reached, and at a depth

of 40 miles a temperature of 3000° Fahrenheit, which we may assume to be sufficient

to m'felt the most refractory rocks of which the earth's crust is composed. If,

therefore, no other circumstance modified the conditions of liquefaction, all within
a thin crust of this thickness would be in a fiuid state. This, however, is not the

case. At these depths the fusing-point is modified by the pressure and conductivity

of the rocks.

  We know that in volcanic districts, where the great subterranean laboratory of

natm-e is partially opened for our inspection, the molten mass, relieved fi-om pres-
siu-e, pours forth from volcanic craters ciuTents of lava which form a peculiar class

of rocks.

   Besides this, it has been ascertained by experiment on soft substances, such as

spermaceti, wax, and sulphur, that the temperatiu'e of fusion increases about l°-3

--Pahi'enheit for every 500 lbs. pressure per square inch, that is, in other words, that

the temperature of fusion under pressure is increased in that ratio. If we assume

this to be the law for the materials of the earth's crust, and correct our previous

calculations in accordance with it, we find that we shall have to go to a depth of

65 miles, instead of merely 40 miles, before the poiat of fusion of the rocks is

reached.

   It must, however, be observed that Mr. Hopkins's later experiments with tin and

mbarytes do not show such an increase of the point of fusion consequence of pres-

sure, and he is led to the belief that it is only in the more compressible substances

that the law holds true.

  Independently of this, however, I\Ir. Hopkins points out to me that in the above

calculation it is assumed that the conductivity of the rocks is the same at great
depths as at the surface. In opposition to this he has shown experimentally that

the conducting power for heat is at least twice as great for the dense igneous

rocks as for the more superfcial sedimentary formations of clay, sand, chalk, &c.

And these close-grained igneous rocks are those which we believe must most

resemble the rocks at great depths below the sm-face. Now Mr. Hopkins shows

that if the conductive power were doubled, the increase of depth, corresponding to

a given increase of temperatm-e, would be doubled, and we should probably have to

descend 80 or 100 miles to reach a temperature of 3000^, besides the further increase

which investigation may show to be due to the influence of pressure on the tempe-

rature of fusion.

   Mr. Hopkins therefore concludes that the exti-eme thinness of the criist assumed
by some geologists to account for volcanic phenomena is imtenable. Calculations
on entirely independent data led him to conclude that the thickness did not fall

short of 800, instead of 30 or 40 miles. If it be so much, he is fiuther led to be-

lieve that the superficial temperature of the cnist is due to some other cause than

myan internal fluid nucleus. It remains a problem, therefore, which  friend Mr.

Hopkins is endeavouring to solve, as to what is the actual condition of the earth

at great depths, and the relation of terrestrial heat to volcanic phenomena.

             Tidal Observations. By Rear-Admiral FitzEot, F.R.S.

   Since the publication of Dr. WheweU's invaluable essays on Tides, much addi-
tional information has been collected by the Admiralty, tMough various siu-veying
expeditions in many parts of the world, respecting tides.

   The accompanying volume of tide-tables shows to what extent our acquaintance
with the facts of the subject goes at present.

   However extended a Imowledge of tidal facts may be wow, compared with that of

the earlier of those past years (some thu-ty), in which all maritime nations have
benefited from light thrown on the subject by that "Essay towards an approxima-
tion," which enabled seamen to discriminate between features until then viewed

in only a confused manner, and taught them clearly how and what to obsei-ve,
there is still very much to be learned.

grapffer, on the tides of the world, which, like the Nautical Almanac, is a text-book
for the seamen of all nations, owes the truth of its principles, and g^eat increase of

its detailed facts, chiefly to I)r. WheweU, and, no doubt, he will cordially add sug-

gestions, if he concurs in the belief that more still should be done.
   In the central parts of the Pacific Ocean, and at numerous isohited points seldom

visited for expressly tidal objects, exact details about the tides are wanting; but
they are unlikely to be ascertained, except by a vessel employed specially for that
puroose.

   lide-gauges, natiiral if not artificial, at such selected places, away from continents
and near the deepest seas, should be watched adequately during a sufficient time,
in order that their residts, and a few comparative observations at known places,
might enable Dr. Whewell to put the finishing hand to his comprehensive works
on Tides, and to leave them completed for the general benefit of posterity.

          On the Distfibution of Fog around the British Isles.
                  By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

Among the returns asked for ],y the Royal Commissioners on Lights, Buoys, and

Beacons, and embodied in the Appendix of their Report laid before Parliament
last session, was " The number of daj's in 1858 on which fogs were noted in the
meteorological register." This question was asked in respect to each lighthouse

or floating light in the United Kingdom. The author had gathered together the
information thus obtained, and had constructed tables of 200 different sites, geogra-

phically arranged, with the frequency of fog at them in the year mentioned.       100
of these sites are in England and Wales, 48 in Scotland, and 52 in Ireland.

   The following conclusions were drawn fi-om the tabidated nimibers :

1st. The average nmnber of days in 1858 on which fogs were noted in the dif-

ferent parts of the United Kingdom is :

                                                  On the coast. At sea.

          England and Wales                       28 21

          Scotland                                22 17

          Ireland                                 19 16

          General average                         24 20

2nd. The distribution of fog over different parts of a sea varies little, even though

it varies greatly on different parts of the adjoiaing coast. Between the River
Humber and the Straits of Dover there are 23 stations at sea which returned num-

bers ranging between 15 and 32, and nearly all included between 18 and 24 ; whUe

the stations on the coast returned numbers irregularly distributed between 7 and

45, and in one instance 81. There are indications that fogs are about equally fre-

quent in other parts of the sea surroimding England and Scotland, but only half

as numerous on the west of St. George's Channel.

3rd. The frequency of fogs on the coast is in many places far less than on the

neighbouring sea. Thus, on the southern and eastern coasts of England there are

14 stations where less than 15 days were noted. Every one of these is a station

near the sea-level ; and among them are the sandbanks at the mouth of the

Thames, and the breakwaters. Promontories of low land are not very often visited

by fogs.

4th. Two stations very near one another, but differing in their elevation above

the sea, often differ widely in the frequency of fog, the lower site having generally

the smaller niunber. Thus the station on the beach at Lowestoft gives 7 days,

while that on the cliflT gives 27. At North Shields, however, it is the reverse.

When5th.  the land rises to a considerable height, and is so situated that it

meets the south-westerly winds directly after they have traversed the ocean, a

fi-equent deposition of moisture is the result--either "fog" or "cloud." The high

points along the south and south-west coasts of England and Wales all give large

numbers, especially the Start, 79 days ; Needles, 75 ; St. Catherine's Point, 76

and Lundy Island (the highest station in England), 76.- The lighthouse at the

Needles has on this account been recently removed from the cliff to a low rock.

In Ireland, the greatest frequency of fog noted in 1858 was at Ballycotton, 55 days,

a high station on the southern coast. The west of Ireland appears not to be visited
by fog so often as the west of England. The greatest number in the whole list is
--58 REPORT 1861.

S126, at Ban-ahead, in the Hebrides ; and this appears the more remarkable, the

neighbouring lighthouse at SkeiTyvore retm-ns the very low number of 6 days ; but
the Skerryvore is a low rock many miles fi-om land, while the station at Ban-ahead
is the highest in the United Kingdom, on the southernmost point of a range of
large islands, and near the Gulf-sti-eam. The eastern side of the Hebrides is not
foggy. The southernmost point of the Shetland Islands likewise returns a high
number. The smallest number noted is at Troon in AjTshu-e, viz. 4.

  --6th. Where a large area of sea is sun-ounded on most s'des by land, fogs are

infrequent at least this seems to hold good on the coasts of the Moray Firth, the
Minch, the Fu-th of Clyde and neighbouring sea, the Solway Firth, and Donegal
and Sligo Bays. It is otherwise in the Bristol Channel. The Irish shore of St.
George's Channel retiu-ns also small numbers, except at Dublin Bay.

  0)1 a Deep-Sea Thermometer invented hy Henry Johnson, Esq., 39 Crutched

                         Friars. By James Glaisher, F.R.S.

   The deep-sea thermometer is intended to be used in expei-iments made with the
deep-sea pressui-e-gauge, to ascertain how much of the variation in volimie indicated
by the gauge is caused by variation of temperature.

   In several experiments made by Mr. Glaisher in the year 1844 upon the tempe-
rature of the Thames water, at difterent seasons of the year, it was found that the
indications of temperatm-e were very materially affected by the pressure of water
upon the bidbs of the thermometers used, even at the depth of 25 feet.

   This circmnstance demonsti-ated the importance of a thermometer for deep sotmd-
ings without liability to derangement of indication fi-om pressiu-e of water, and led

to the construction of the instninient now described, the indications of which are
regulated by the lateral motion of compensation bars, composed of thin bars of two

metals riveted together that expand and contract in different ratios with change of

temperature. Upon one end of a narrow plate of metal about a foot in length (a) are

fixed three scales of temperature (h) ranging from 25° to 100° Fahrenheit.

   Upon one of these scales, as shown in the drawing on an enlarged scale, the pre-

sent temperature is indicated by the point of a Eneedle { ), which turns upon a

pivot in its centre, and on the other scales register indices f)(ff, are pushed by a
pin on the needle (e) to the maximimi and minimimi temperatures, where they are

retained by stiff" friction.
   To the needle are attached at equal distances from the centre, by connecting

pieces (d d), the free ends of two compensation bars (b b). the other ends of the bars
being attached by the plate (c) to the above-mentioned plate (a).

   The motion of the needle is regulated by the lateral motion of these bars with
change of temperature. In order to avoid disturbance of indication by lateral con-
cussion, two bars are used in lieu of one bar only.

   The compensation bars are composed of brass and steel, in the proportion of two-
thirds of brass (which is the more dilatable metal) and one-third of steel, and have
sufficient lateral motion to admit of legible scales of temperature, and also sufficient
power to overcome the stiff fi-iction of the indices.

   The specific gi-avity of brass being 8-39, and that of steel 7 'SI, it is obvious that
no pressure of water can have any effect upon the motive power of the bars, or
upon the indications of temperatiire, as imder hydraulic pressure equal to that of a

depth of 6000 fathoms of water it acquires a density of 1'06 only.
   The compensation bars are strongly tinned as a protection against sea-water, and

the pivots on which the needle and indices move are stronglv gilt.
   In surveying expeditious tliis instriiment may be servicea\»le in giving notice of

a variation of depth of water, and of the necessity for talcing soundings.

  A diminution of temperature of water has been observed by scientific voyagers to

accompany a diminution of depth, as on approaching hidden rocks or shoals, or
nearing land, and also on approaching icebergs.

   The instrument has been suspended by Mr. Glaisher on a thennometer-stand
for a period of six months, and read daily in connexion with standard meteorolo-
gical instniments, and during this time its readings were approximate to those of

the best instnmaents.

   The case of the instrument has been improved at the suggestion of Admiral
FitzRoy, and now presents to the water a smooth cylindrical surface with rounded
ends, and without any projecting fastenings.

On a Deep-Sea Pressure- Gauge invented hy Henry Johnson, Esq.

By James Glaisher, F.R.S.

In deep soimdings the pressure of water is too great to admit of measurement by

Aa highly elastic fluid in a small portable instrument.  slight degree of elasticity

has been discovered in water itself, and which admits of a vessel of water being

used as a measure of the amount of pressure at great depths.

Mr. Canton, whose experiments were communicated to the Royal Society on

Dec. 16, 1762, found, in water subjected to the pressure of an additional atmosphere,

a diminution in vohune of one part in 21,740 ; and in water placed under a receiver

he found an increase of one part in 21,740 when the air was exhausted.

   Mr. Perkins found a diminution of yf gth parts in the volume of water subjected
to a pressure equal to 1120 atmospheres, or about one part in 19,000 for one atmo-

sphere.

  A pressure-gauge of metal was exhibited at the Meeting of the British Associa-

mtion 1860, and is described at page 203, consisting of a cylinder filled with water,

with a solid piston or ram, with a graduated scale, and an index to mark the length

of piston forced into the cylinder, compressing the water in it by the gi-eater den-

sity of the surrounding water.

   As, however, it is foimd that air-bubbles adhere to the inner surface of the metal

cylinder, and the exclusion of air is miportant, a pressiti'e-gauge is now exhibited

composed entirely of glass, which is not liable to this disadvantage.

It consists of a cylindrical glass vessel with a finely graduated long stem or
60 REPORT 1861.

neck, within which are placed a flat elastic ring and an elastic stopper. When the

water in the gauge is compressed, the stopper and ring are pressed down the stem
towards the cylinder ; and when it expands, the elastic stopper is pressed back, the

elastic ring remaining as an index of compression.

   Some few precautions are necessary before use, viz. the gauge should be well

rinsed with boiled water for the purpose of preventing the adhesion of air to its
inner sm-face. It should then be filled, to the top of the stem, with sea-water
boiled to free it from air.

   The elastic ring should now be inserted, and then the stopper, with a vent or

small grooved needle at the side, to allow superfluous water to escape, and it should

be pressed down the stem until its lower edge and the point or zero-line marked
20()() are coincident. The grooved needle should then be withdrawn, and the
stopper will tightly fit the stem. The stopper should be slightly lubricated to pre-

vent excessive fiiction.

   On descending into water of greater density the water in the gauge is compressed
until equally dense, and the elastic stopper and elastic ring are pressed down the
stem towards the cylinder. On ascending to water of less density the water in the

gauge expands, and the stopper is pressed upwards, leaving the elastic ring behind.

   Upon regaining the surface after the experiment, the water in the gauge should

press the stopper nearly back to its former position on the zero-line, a small dif-
ference being caused by friction.

   The elastic ring marks the extreme compression at the greatest depth attained.
This depth should be determined by the sounding line, to which the instrumeut
should in these experiments be for some time attached.

   The volume of the water in the cylinder and stem is considered to be divided
into 2000 parts, of which the stem contains one-tenth or 200 parts ; these are num-
bered fr-om 1800 to 2000.

   Each part on the stem may be easily read to a tenth, or a 20,000th part of the

whole quantity.

  A compression of sea-water of one part in 20,000 is caused by a pressure of

15-8 lbs. avoirdupois per square inch, or a depth of 35,456 feet, or nearly six fathoms.

   The experiments of Mr. Canton and Mr. Johnson confirm this estimate of pres-
sure, so that it appears to afford a basis for the compilation of tables for the com-
parison of pressure and depth.

   It is, however, very desirable that depths thus estimated should be tested by
attaching the instrument to soimding fines, and that any necessary corrections
should be made in the tables.

   Such a comparison and correction woidd render the indications of the gauge
valuable when strong cuiTents make the use of the lead uncertain.

  A correction is required for fi-iction, yet to be determined, and a correction for

the variation of volume with change of temperature, as shown in the preceding
Table, which is based upon very niunerous and accurate experiments.

   relating to Mr. Green's Balloon Ascents. By J. Glaishee, F.R.S.

       On the Cloud Mirror and Sunshine Recorder. By J. T. Goddaed.

   The Cloud Mirror was simply a mirror of a circular form with the points of
the compass marked on its frame ; this being presented face upwards to the sky,
and having its centre con-ectly marked and placed horizontal with the north point

of instrument towards the south meridian, enabled a person to observe the direction

from which the clouds were moving. The Sunshine Recorder was a piece of pho-
tographic paper placed in the bottom of a box blackened inside, the top of which
had in the centre a small circular hole, through which a slender beam of sunlight

coidd be admitted to pass on to the photographic paper. When the sun did not

shine, no mark was left on the paper ; when it did, its varying diurnal course left a
corresponding line on the paper, its position marking the hours of sunshine, and
its breadth and depth of shade indicating the gi-eater or less radiating power of the
sun. By inserting a thick glass disc or plano-convex lens in the box, the number
of hours' registry would be made equal to a simimer day's sunshine.

On the Connexion between Storms and Vertical Disturhayices of the Atmosphere.

                             By Professor Hennesst, F.R.S.

 _ As storms are usually preceded by the contact of masses of air of different den-

sities and different degrees of elasticity, it follows that anterior to such storms a

process of connexion may exist between the heterogeneous columns of the atmo-
sphere. Under such circimistances, the sudden indraught of smoke in chimneys

and the whirling about of light objects near the ground had frequently been noticed.
The author endeavoiu-ed to make more precise observations by the aid of a vane,
which shows the presence of upward and downward ciu-rents in the atmosphere,

while also indicating the horizontal direction of the wind. Diu-ing the winter of
1860-61, he found that most of the stomas were preceded by more or less violent
vertical movements of the atmosphere. Such movements were especially obser-

vable before the great gale of February 9*. The analogy between some of the
vertical motions observed in the vane and those of the water-barometer foimerly
erected by Professor Uaniell in the apartments of the Royal Society was pointed
out, and fi-esh residts were anticipated fi-om the renewed erection of this kind of
instrument by Mr. Glaisher. The general conclusion to which Professor Hennessy
has been led, is, that during the comparative absence of horizontal motion in the
air, energetic vertical cim-ents may be grouped among the most certain symptoms
of approaching disturbances on a gi'ander scale.

On the Theories of Glacial Motion. By William Hopkins, M.A., LL.D. F.R.S.

   The author firet gave distinct definitions of temis designating those properties of
bodies with which we are necessarily concerned in investigations connected with
glacial phenomena, such as solidity, viscosity, extensibility, elasticity, and the like.
According to those views, which rested on l)r. Tyndall's experiment of reo-elation
ice must uecessai-Uy be considered as solid. Proceeding on this hypothesis, Mr. Hop-
kins stated the pressures and tensions to which a glacial mass must be subjected at

any internal point. He showed how the internal tensions woidd exactly account for

the fonnation of open fissiu'es or crevasses, according to the law which they were

                      * Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. vii. p. 494.

observed to follow ; and also that the internal pressiu-es were exactly such as were

consistent with Dr. TjTidaU's views of the cause of the laminar structure of glacial
ice, so far as it was a necessary condition, according to those views, that the stnic-

tm-al lamina shoidd be perpendicular to the dii-ection of maximum pressiu-e.

Moreover he showed that the internal action was inconsistent with Principal
Forbes's theory, which attributed the laminar structure to a diiFerential motion of

the contiguous lamina. He also explained the importance of the slidinff of glaciers

over the beds of their containing valleys, not only as the cause of a large portion of
the whole observed motion, but also as increasing in a large degi-ee the efficiency

of the internal tension and pressiu-e in producing the dislocation and crushing
which were necessaiy for the general motion of the glacier.

On the Deficiency of Bain in an Elevated Rain-gauge, as caused by Wind.

            By W. S. Jevons, B.A.

  When wind meets any obstacle, those strata of air which are near to the obstacle

must be compressed, and must move with gi'eater rapidity, just as a river moves
most quickly in the narrowest parts of its channel. Thu8,"wind blowing against a

house or tower has a greater velocity just above the summit of the building, than

where there is no disturbance. Now a rain-drop, when falling through the vdnd,

describes the diagonal of the rectangle of which the sides represent the velocities
due to gravity and the impidsion of the wind. The path of a rain-drop then is in-

clined at an angle from the vertical direction of which the tangent vanes nearly as

the velocity of the wind. Two equal rain-di-ops, therefore, falling into a cun-ent of

air at points where the velocity is not the same, wiU not pmsue parallel paths. The

one drop will either approach to or recede from the .other, and the eflect will be to

Aincrease or diminish the quantity of rain falling in the intemiediate space.  dia-

gram or a slight calculation will show this eflect to be considerable, so that when

a shower of rain falls through wind upon any obstacle, such as a house, a large part

of the rain-drops wUl be blown beyond the obstacle by the increased velocity ofthe

wind, and less rain wiU fall on the windward part of the top of the obstacle than

elsewhere.

An ordinaiy rain-gauge, even when suspended in mid-air, will likewise act as an

obstacle in the same manner, but in a less degree. Until, then, this effect of the
wind upon the amoimt of rain collected in a gauge, either suspended in the air or

placed upon a building, be properly allowed for, no conclusion can be drawn from

any rain-gauge obser\-ations as to a real vai-;ation ofthe rauifall according to elevation.
   Observations by Luke Howard, by Boase of Penzance, and by others clearly exhibit

this influence of the wind. Other published observations, even those at the Green-
wich Obsei-vatory, exhibit such gi'eat and uregidar individual discrepancies, that no

valid conclusion can be drawn from them. To take an average under such circimi-

stances, it is argued, gives a purely fallacious appearance of unifomiity and law.
   The possibility of a real variation of rain with elevation is then treated on a priori

gi'pimds, and it is concluded that the condensation theory, fii-st proposed by Benja-
min Frankhn, and the only one of the least validity ever oifered to account for the

apparent variation of rain, will never, imder the real chcumstanc es of the atmo-

sphere, account for more than an almost infinitesimal increase of the raiu-di-ops in
the last few hundred feet of descent.

Observations on the coldness of rain when it reaches the surface oppose, instead

of supporting, the theory of condensation, since the colduess of the rain-drop proves
that it has condensed little or no vapour throughout its descent.

Arago's argument in favoiu- of the increase of rain-di-ops near the surface, founded

on the disappearance of the supernumerary rainbows near the ground, is also quite

inconclusive, since the rain-drops probably become irregidar in size by coalition, and
would not become iiregular by condensation of vapour.

All observations by rain-gauges much elevated or exposed to wind ai-e to be

rejected as fallacious, and in accm-ate rain-observations it is recommended to place

a verj' flat collecting vessel of considerable ai-ea in the centi-e of a flat surface upon

On a Solar Halo observed at Sydney, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, August 13, 1861.

           By H. W. Ckaavley.

This day I witnessed, as well as all our household, a remarkable phenomenon. The

sun appeared as if in mourning. At twelve o'clock I first observed it. An imm ense

dark halo sun-oimded the sun, as dark as a thimder-cloud ; the outer edge of it was
Airidescent, appearing like a circular rainbow.
                                                 ring of bright white light, of gi-e ater

diameter than the halo, intersected it, passing through the sim ; and two other rings

of the same sort, but fainter, of still larger diameter, intersected the first ring and

each other, in the manner I have attempted to show in the accompanying ske tch,
in which I have preserved, as nearly as I coidd judge, the relative proportions of the
halo and rings to each other and to the sun. It was a bright day, the sun blazing

directly overhead, out of a clear blue sky, but there were hard, electi-ic-looking cl ouds
in other parts of the sky ; and from these were drawn out long, attenuated, fl eecy,
ribbon-like appendages, which all took a cii-cular form, having the sun apparently
for a centre. The halo and rings firat appeared about an hour before noon, and con-
tinued as long after noon. Throughout the remainder of the day the clouds were

in circular tiers or ranges about the sun, which became obscured. The weather for

several days previouslv had been uncommonly cold and imsettled for the season, and

the clouds rushed confusedly in all directions against each other ; before which time

there had been a pi-otracted term of very hot and dry weather, thermometer ranarinff

--from 80° to 90° in the shade.

  August 17. The bad weather prevented my sending this letter over the water to

the post-office last post-day (ISth), there ha^dng been two days of a cold easte rly

storm of wind and rain following upon the before-described phenomenon, but to-day

and yesterday all bright and warm again.         (Signed) H. W. Crawley.

Description of a Mercurial Barometer, recently invented ii/ Mr. Richard Howson,

           Engineer of Middlesborough-on-Tees. By Petee J. Livset.

    This barometer consists of a straight tube, called in this paper "the tube," similar

to that used for the common straight barometer, but somewhat longer, and a

hollow stalk nearly the same length as the tube, but of such smaller diameter that
it will pass up the bore of the tube and leave an annidar space of about jijth or ith
of an inch. The lower end of the stalk is smTounded and united with a shoi-t tube

called "the cistern," sufficiently large in diameter to allow the tube to pass into it

and leave an annular space. When the barometer is in working order, "the tube "

is suspended freely in a vertical position with its open end downwards, the stalk
passing up the bore of the tube till the lower end of the tube enters the cistern ; and
the anmdar spaces between the stalk and interior of tube, and the stalk and cistern,
are filled with mercury, the cistern containing sufficient mercury for the immersion

of the lower end of the tube when the stalk and cistern are at their lowest position.
The tube and cistern are filled with niercm-y to form a vacuum at the upper end of

the tube, so that the pressm-e of the atmosphere alone will sustain the weight

of the stalk, cistern, and mercmy.

   The stalk has a buoyant power sufficient to carry its own weight, the cistern,
and the mercmy in the cistern, at the lowest pressiu-e of the atmosphere. The
pressure of the atmosphere will be shown by this bai'ometer, by the difference be-

tween the level of the mercury in the cistern and that in the tube, by the position
of the top of the column in the tube, and by the position of the stalk and cistern.

   Barometers may be made upon this principle, having a long range or movement
for a small change of pressiu-e, by which such changes may be measm-ed with great
delicacy ; and this advantage, without the inconvenience of a very long scale, may

be obtained by using weights which can be added or removed as requhed for, say,

the whole inches, reading the fractions of the inch ft-om the scale.
   One advantage of this barometer is the comparatively small quantity of mercury

required. Tubes of large diameter may therefore be employed, and thus instruments
having great power and accm-acy may be obtained, as a small change of pressure

will be multiplied by the large area, and the power or change of pressm-e acting to
produce a movement in the barometer will thus be gi-eat in proportion to the fric-
tion resisting the movement.

   The formula for calculating the rise of the top of the column of mercury in the

                                                     TP

tube for any given increase of pressure is R=-p--t-P-

   The formula for the movement of the cistern for any given rise, when the mer-

cury extends above the stalk and fills the entire bore of the tube at the lowest

              · TP
pressure, is R=-p ; but when the stalk extends above the colimin of mercury and

--=into the vacuum space, it is E.^  The increase in the depth of the cistern

E D R=is obtained by the foi-mula
- ; when the top of the stalk is always below

the mercury and it fills the entire bore of the tube, the depth of the cistern is uni-

Rform for all pressm-es. In the above formula is the total rise of the top of the

R Rcolumn in the tube for any given increase of pressure, rise of cistern, rise of

Glevel of cistern, T area of the bore of the tube, area of the glass or material pro-
Pducing displacement in the tube, pressui-e in inches of mercury, C area of cistern,

C area of cistern minus G, T area of annular space between interior bore of the
                           TP

Gtube and the stalk, D=--,--·. In these formulae it is supposed that the tube, stalk,

and cistern are perfect tubes or cylinders uniform in area throughout their entire

lengths.

     On the Great Cold of CJiristmas 1860, and its destructive Effects.

perhaps as great, if not greater than had ever occurred in England since the iBven-

tion of the thenuonieter, it appeared desiraljlo to record so unusual a degree of cold,

together Avith its destructive eiibcts in the midland counties. Some idea of the fear-
fid ravages amongst trees and plants might be gathered from the fact that not only-

had numerous branches of the oak been damaged, but in some instances large
trees themselves had been Irilled. The summits of hills had escaped much of the

ravages of the frosts that had been so seriously felt in the valleys. He gave a long

list of the destruction of trees and plants as recorded in the report at the Highfield
House Observatory, and stated that the destruction of birds and insects was also
very great. One circumstance Tvith regard to this excessive cold, which he recorded

at the time, he wished to repeat. He alluded to large icicles which he had seen

formed at the nose of a horse. Turning to tho teniperature, there were frosts every
night from the 12th of December to the 19th of January, the temperature on the

grass on the coldest nights being from 21° 5' on tho ISth af December, down as
low as 17° 5' on tho 10th of January. At four feet above the ground tho greatest

--cold was on the 24th of December, ,(JP 5', and on the 2otli 8-0. The mean tempe-

ratures of the coldest days were 13° 3' on the 24th, 4° 0' on the 25th, 22° 6' on the

T26th, 23° 6' on the 28th, and 21° on the 29th. The greatest heat only reached

12° on the 2.5th, and only 10° in full simshine. During this excessive cold wea-
ther he had delicate thermometers placed at various heights above the ground, up
to 27 feet. These instruments were used constantly. The thermometers were all

compared with the standard presented to him by the British Association. He

named this, as ho was aware that some meteorologists conceived that the records

given were impossible for the climate of England. Nevertheless he had the con-

firmation of 27 iustriiments placed on and above the ground, and also on his
observator}-, and giving a temperature of from 7° to 14° below zero, according to

the circunistances under which they were placed. He could vouch for the accuracy

of the readings of his instruments ; and as he had an equal number of mercurial
and spirit thermometers, it could scarcely be possible for the temperature given to
be far from tho truth. AVliatever might be the opinion as regarded the actual

temperature, there could be no doubt as regai'ded the destruction, which exceeded
anything remembered by tho oldest person. In 1854 a temperature of 4° below zero

destroyed many trees, but the destruction in 1860 was very much gi'eater.

--My dear Lord Lyons, You are no doubt aware that all, or nearly all the

States of Christendom that uso the sea, have practically agreed to unite in carrying

on, through their Navies at sea, a series of observations for tho improvement of

navigation and the benefit of commerce, and tJiat men learned in the physics of the

sea and air have been appointed in Norway and Sweden, in Russia, Denmark,

Holland, France, England, Spain, Italy, and 'Portugal, to take charge of these ob-

servations, and either to discuss them themselves, or so to dispose of them that
they may be treated by experts and tho results made known to all concerned ; and

tliat from tlie Bureaus estaMislied for this purpose in Holland, London, and Paris,

highly important results have been already obtained and given to tho world as the

common property of all. These results, by rendering navigation less dangerous and

speedy, have confen'ed numerous benefits upon all those of every nation who follow

the sea.

Thus a sort of maritime and scientific confederation of the principal commercial

nations has been practically formed, for the purpose of carrying on certain investi-

gations concerning the physics of the sea, in which all the world has a stake.

myDuring these investigations, it has fallen to  lot to be led, by the paths of in-
--duction thus opened, to certain conclusions that are of general concern not indeed

to the people of any one nation alone, but to all who own ships,--and which I beg

to lay before you, with the hope that you will deem them of suflicient consequence

to be brought to the notice of the Government you so worthily represent, to the

end that such further steps may be taken in the premises as the increase of our

knowledge concerning the planet we inhabit and the good of mankind may seem

to require.

  I may be pei-mitted to remark, that though this system of reseai'ch upon which
we are engaged presents the most extensive combination that has ever been foiined
among navies, and though it giyes employment to the largest coi-ps of observers

that has ever been known to unite in any one plan of physical research, yet it is

almost literally without cost ; at least the expenses are so divided between the

observers and the public exchequers of the States concerned, that the chief expense

consists in discussing and publishing the obsei-vations after they ai-e made. In fact,

the obseiTera are quite wiUing to render their services upon the simple condition

that they may have the free use of the results obtained. Thus all the gi-eat na-

tions have been brought to unite and cooperate in a uniform system of physical

research at sea.

In the com-se of these investigations, facts and cumuustances have been brought

to light which affoKl grounds for the belief that the Antai'ctic winter is by no means

as severe as that of the Arctic. This belief, connected with the fact that there is

about the South Pole an unexplored area that in extent can compass Europe more

than twice, induces me to lay the matter before yom'self and others at this time,
trusting that by biinging the subject to such notice, as well as to that of my own

Government and others equally interested and concerned, measures loolring to fur-

ther examination and exploration of those imkuown regions in the Soutli may be

set on foot.

Reasons for believing the Antarctic to be much less severe than the Ai'ctic winter,

have been stated at some length in a work on the ' Physical Geogi-aphy of the Sea

and its Meteorology,' recently published in London but as that work may not have
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

fallen imder yom* notice, I beg leave to call yom- attention to the Tables, Diagrams,

and Plates in the accompanying Nautical Monogi-aph, No. 2, on ' The Bahometer

AT Sea,' still more recently issued by this ofiice. Our observations on the barometer

at sea are nimierous and abimdant. They reach from the parallel of 60° S. to the

ice-bound seas of the North ; they are for all seasons, months and days of the year.
They have been made over and over again ; some by German, some by Russian,
some by English, Dutch, French, Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Portuguese, Italian,

Austrian, Chilian, Siamese, Sandwich Islands, Brazilian and American navigators.
They have been repeated and midtiplied by so many, by such factors, and so often,

that they leave but little room for doubt as to the approxunate mean pressure of the

atmosphere on every square foot of ocean sm-face within the range of modern navi-

gation. They enable us for the first time literally to gauge and weigh the atmo-

sphere that rests upon the sea ; they also aiTord us data for computing its pressure

Aupon evei-y square foot of sea sm-face from pole to pole.  patient discussion of

these observations has revealed a wonderful degree of atmospherical attenuation

within the Antarctic Ch'cle. They indicate that the average quantity of air super-

incumbent upon a square foot of the eai-th's siu^face there, does not weigh as much,

by about 130 lbs., as that which is supeiincumbent upon a square foot here.

The unexplored regions environing the South Pole embrace in round numbers

an aj'ea of eight millions of square miles. The quantity of atmosphere that rests

upon these eight millions lacks then, according to these observations and this

computation, no less than 12,943,500,000,000 tons in weight, of being as much as

usuallj' rests upon an area of like extent in these northern latitudes.

This is an inconceivably great mass, whether we attempt to comprehend it by its

weight or its volimre.
                                                                                                 ;

The force of gravaty, if left free to act, would distribute the air in equal quanti-

ties and alike about both poles, and make the bai-ometric pressiu-e nearly the same

for all latitudes. There must, therefore, be some force exerted upon the air, or in

the air of these vmknown Austral reg^ions, which counteracts gravity to that enor-

mous extent, and prevents such equal distribution.

  What the natm-e of this force may be is matter of conjecture, but we think it
may sm-ely be traced to heat. " What !" I almost hear you say, "heat enough in

pei-petual development about the South Pole to exert a ceaseless lifting force of
                                                                                                   "
130  lbs.  upon  every  square  foot  of  surface  within  an  area  of  8,000,000 square miles
                                                                                                 ?

   Be not startled ; but freeing yom' mind from all bias, give me, I pray you, your
attention while I endeavom* to show that in this theory of a constant play of heat

about the South Pole there is nothiug either very startling or paradoxical.

Under the equatorial cloud ring, the mean barometric pressm-e is 20 lbs. less to

the square foot than it is in the calm belt of Cancer. This fact is familiar to sea-

men, and well known to meteorologists. To this diminished pressure we owe the

trade-winds, as Captain Sir James Ross and others have already remarked. More

than this : in the centre of the cyclone the atmosphere is so attenuated, that ita

pressure is sometimes diminished below the mean pressure of the place by more

than 200 lbs. to the square foot.

   To what, if not chiefly to heat, shall we attribute this ? But whence comes the

heat at such times and places ? Clearly, it is not direct heat impressed upon the air

then and there by the rays of the sun.

The equatorial cloud ring overhangs a region of constant precipitation, and the

low barometer in the vortex of a tornado is always attended by deluges of rain.

Here then we have a condition that accompanies the place of low barometer, both

in the calm belt and the vortex. During this heavy precipitation that takes place

in the centre of the storm, immense volimies of heat, that is always latent in aqueous

vapom", are set free among the clouds ; it warms and expands and drives off the
upper ail'. Thus, that below is made to rush in at the surface, either, as the case

may be, with the constancy of the gentle ti-ades, or the violence of the hurricane,

according to the extent and manner of the rarefaction. Moreover, the vapour before

it is formed into rain, being lighter than the air, also assists to diive it away, so

that the barometer would stand higher under air that is dry, than under air that is

damp, even were there no vapour condensed. Now then sm-vey, if you please, on
a chart or globe, the Austral regions on the solar side of 40° S., and tell me what

do you see ? Why, all the way around, between that parallel and the Antarctic

Circle, you see an almost uninterrupted expanse of water. Indeed, with the ex-

ception of Patagonia, and a few comparatively small islands here and there and far

between, we have nothing but one continuous evaporating surface. Throughout this

entire expanse the prevailing vriuds are from the northward and westward. These
are the " brave west winds" of the southern hemisphere. They are strong winds
they suck up fi-om the sea moisture as they go ; they waft immense clouds of it over
into the unexplored regions that encu-cle the pole. This vapom- is to the winds what

fuel is to the steamer ; the latent heat contained in it being developed, is at once
the source of power in the aii", and the means of locomotion for the blast. Thus

loaded, these winds impinge, with their vapour and its latent heat, upon the icy

banier or upon the mountains there, where it is condensed, and its heat set free to

become sensible heat. Thus the severity of the Antarctic winter is mitigated by

heat that is rendered latent by the processes of evaporation in wann latitudes, and

conveyed to the south by invisible couriers through the air. This heat being thus

conveyed and liberated, waims and expands, and causes the polar air to ascend, as

the same kind of heat causes the aii* in the centre of the cyclone to ascend and flow

off, creating, like a huge stack to some inmiense furnace, a di-aught and innish of air

on the surface, from the distance of miles around. This di-aught into the Antarctic

unknown, extends from the South Pole all around to the distance of 8000 miles

towards the Equator.

   About the North Pole we have no such expanse of water, no such wafting of

vapour, no such low barometer, no such inrush of " brave west vsdnds," and conse-

quently no such mildness of climate.

Behold all the rivers of Arctic America, Em'ope, and Asia ! The rains that feed

them are but occasional and gentle showers in comparison with those for which
                                                                                           5*
--G4 report ISGl.

the oToat expani?(3 of southorn waters affords tlie vapoiii's; and yet, in the conden-
sation of the vapour for tlio rains to feed these rivers, he.xt enoiip^h is set free in the
clouds to raise from tlie freezinc- to tlie boilini>--point, and as fast as it flows, more
tlian live times the volume of water that the said rivers discharge into the sea.

   But how the latent heat of vapom* when set free in the clouds may reach down
and wai-m the earth, may perhaps be understood by referring to a meteorological

necessit}-, which rec[iures, tcJwn the windward side of the mountain is rainy, the lee

side to be irarm.

   To illustrate this, let us suppose a gossamer sack, capable of being hermetically
sealed ; that it is impervious to heat, and elastic as the air itself ; that with the
barometer at 30 in., tlie temperature at 60^, and the dew-point the same, this sack

be tilled with air ; that then it be attached to a balloon and sent up in the sk}', to
a height where the baroraeti-ic pressm-e is only 15 in., and where the temperatm-e of
the air in the sack, by reason of this diminished pressm-e, and by virtue of the ex-

pansion of the air within and its consequent cooling, is reduced to zero. By this
process, the vapoiu" ^vith which the air was loaded when it was admitted into the

sack has, let it be assumed, been condensed, and consequently its latent heat set

 free in the sack.

   Suppose now the sack be hauled down to the surface again, where the barometric
pressure is .30 in., as before, and what have we ? The sack is reduced to its fomier
dimensions you will perceive, but instead of damp air we now have it filled with

--dry ; moreover, there is at the bottom a measure of water the condensed vapour.

 This chy air, instead of being at the temperatme of CO-*, has a temperatiire of GO^ ^j/ms
 the quantity of heat that it would require to raise 5A such measures of water from

the freezing- to the boiling-point. In other words, we have but illustrated a natm-al
 process that is continually going on and well understood, by which heat is bottled
 away in vapoura, wafted by the ^^'iuds from clime to clime, liberated, and iiually,
 in the processes of vertical cu'culation, drawn do^vni from the ciystal reservoirs of
 the sky to temper and warm the surfoco of the earth.

    "When the vapour-laden west %\iuds of the South Pacific strike against the wind-
 ward side of the Patagonian Andes, are they not by nature herself subjected to a
 process precisely analogous to that of vapour-laden air in the h}iiothetical sack ?
 Sti'iking against the western slopes of the mountain, they are forced up to the top
 of the snow-capped range. Here condensation of vapoiu- and the liberation of its
 latent heat talce place ; and though the cold be extreme at the top, in consequence
 of the state of aerial rarefaction there, yet the winds lia's'ing received the heat libe-
 rated from their vapom-s, are, before it can. bo dispei-sed by radiation, forced over
 from the eastern slopes. Here descending into the valleys, and being again com-
 pressed by the full weight of the barometiic column, the heat they have received is

 fully developed, and they are felt as wann -winds, just as the air brought down in
 the sack was waiiu. The mild climate of Eastern Patagonia and the Falkland

 Islands is due to caloric thus conveyed, developed and dispei-sed.

    To appreciate the amount of heat thus conveyed and distributed, let ns compare
 the climate of Eiistem Patagonia, between the parallels of 50^ and 52° south, -with
 the climate of Labrador, between the corresponding parallels north. Those who
 would judge of climate, as philosophers formerly did, viz. according to latitude,
 woidd say these two climates are duplicates of each other, for the two places are

 equidistant from the Equator, and in both coimtries west -svinds are the prevailing

 winds ; they both also have a continent to -windward, an ocean to leeward ; llo-wing
 in from each and along their eastern shores, there is like-ndse an ice-bearing current.

 But what do modem researches show ? They show that the -winter climate of

  Labrador is ice-boimd, bitter in the extreme, and incapable of affording vegetable

 subsistence for man and beast ; that that of Patagonia in the corresponding latitude

 south is, on the other hand, quite open and mild, affording grasses for cattle all the

Mountain,?, nro robbed of their moisture -n-liicli tlicy sucked up from the Pacific, and

the heat set fi-ee in tlie process is dispersed by condensation and radiation lono- be-
fore the winds can convey it to Labrador. But in East Patagonia and the Falkland

Islands, the air, charged with heat received from the heavy precipitation on the top
of the Andes, is brought du'ectly thence to the plains below, and before it has had

time to grow cold.

   The iniiuences to which is due this great diilereuce between the winter climate of
Labrador and of Patagonia are even more marked in theii" ellect upon the ^\rctic as

contrasted with the Antai-ctic winter.

   The Patagonian-like climate of the south is repeated iu the north along the
eastern base of the Rocky Mountains. On their western slopes, the vapours from

the Pacific are condensed into rains for the Columbia and Frazer and other rivers.

The heat that is there liberated in this process is sufiicieut to raise fi-om the freezing-

to the boiling-point all the water that could be supplied by a quintuple set of such
rivers. This heat makes green pastures on the castem slopes of the Rocky Moim-
tains, where the buifalo, in herds of countless munbors, finds winter pastm-age. Now,

along the same parallels in Labrador it is simply impossible, on accoimt of the ex-

treme cold, for a buflalo or any other graminivorous animal to find other winter

subsistence than mosses and lichens.

  A still more stiiking instance of the climatological influence of continental, in

comparison with oceanic winds upon countries in high latitudes, is afforded by

L-eland and Labrador, between the parallels of 51° and 53° N. In both comitries
the prevailing winds are <ilso fr-om the west. But those in Leland come laden

from open sea with vapom-s, which, being condensed upon the hill-sides, liber.ate

their heat and dispense warmth, which gives to that " Gem of the Ocean" its name

of EstEHALD. The same difterence of climate, ovtdng to wet winds from the sea and

dry winds from the land prevailing at places having the same latitude, is repeated

upon the N.W. coast of America and the N.E. coast of Asia.

   The unexplored regions of the South Pole are smTounded by open water ; those
of the North for the most part by land. The winds that blow into the Frozen Ocean

of the North are continental winds ; the climate there, like that of Labrador and

Siberia, is proportionable severe.

   The winds that blow in upon the unlmown Sotith being therefore oceanic winds,

there is probably as much difference of -winter climate between the two polar regions

as there is between the winters of Labrador and of Ireland, or the Falkland Islands.

  Now then, with these facts and suggestions impressed upon om- mind, let us once

niore tirni to the unknown regions of the Antarctic. They are fi'inged with icy bamers

abutting, as far as exploration has reached, up against lofty peak's and mountain

i-anges. The air that strikes upon their northern face is heavily laden with vapour.

Traversing that immense waste of waters, it impinges upon those slopes completely
satm-ated with moisture. Here all that moisture is ^\^.·ung out of it. The heat that
is liberated by the process is sufficient to attenuate the air in the remarkable manner

indicated by tlie barometer, exhibited by observations, and repeated in the Tables and

Plates of this Monograph. If we would know how heavy this precipitation is, how

--high the mountains, steep the declivities, and great the development of latent heat

there, let us consult the icebergs they afford unmistakeable indications upon the
subject. The Antarctic icebergs are of fresh, not of salt water. Towering 200 or 300

feet above the sea and reaching 600 or 800 feet below*, as many of them do, they

literally dot with their huge masses an extent of ocean that embraces no less than

17,000,000 square miles in its supei-ficial area. As much heat as it takes to melt and

convert into vapour again all these immense masses of ice, is set free on those un-
knowTi hill-sides, when the water to fonn them of was vwung out of the clouds.

   Doubtless this vapour ^-ith its heat impresses characteristic features upon the

winter climate of the South Polo ; and thus we are impelled by the winds, persuaded
by the barometer, nay, urged by the longings of the liuman heart, and encom-aged

by the great laws of Nature herself to venture and explore.

To smn up, the physical featm-es of the northern hemisphere indicate that the

climate  of the Arctic  regions  is continental,  for they are  surroimded  by  land                     explo-
                                                                                                      ;

ration confirms it. On the contrary, those of the southern hemisphere indicate that

70 REPORT 1861.

the climate of the Antarctic is marine, for those regions are smrounded by water.

No explorer has spent a winter there to prove it, but all the known facts and cir-
cumstances seem to confirm it. An example or two will make it plain that it imtst

he so. Labrador is the type of a continental climate ; Ireland of a marine in the

same latitude. As the simimer of Ii-eland is cooler than that of Labrador, so may
the Antarctic summer climate be cooler than the ^Yrctic.

   The average mid-winter temperatm-e of Iceland is but 1.3° colder than its average
July temperatm'e ; whereas the difierence between the mean winter and siunmer
temperature of Fort Simpson is 70°. But this Fort, gi-eat as is thLs contrast of
climate, is situated within the sweep of the S.W. -nands fi'om the N. Pacific, and
therefore its climate is only semi-continental. Nevertheless its smnmer tempera-

ture is 15° higher than that of Iceland. Now these two places are in about the

--same latitude north, but with this sti-iking difference one is suiToimded by water

as the Antarctic is, the other by land, as the Arctic.
   The islands of the sea, and the interior of continents throughout the world in

high latitudes, abound in such climatic contrasts.
   The difference between the mean winter and summer temperatiu^e of the marine

climates of the south is probably, and for obvious reasons, not so gi-eat as it is in
corresponding latitudes north. The lowest point reached by a self-registering tlier-
mometer, not for a season or a month, but in the coldest day dm-iug a period of

several years at the South Shetland Islands, in 63° S., was 5° Fahr. At Yakoutsk,

on the other hand, which in Asia is about as far from the North as the South Shet-
lands are fi'om the South Pole, and in a tndy continental climate, the thermometer

goes down in winter to 70° Fahr.*, while for July its mean temperatm-e is 60°t.
Thus, though 10° of lat. further to the north, it receives the same amount of heat

in simimer that is felt at Dublin f ; one place being near to and siuroimded by sea,
the other far removed from open water and the influences of the copious discharge
of latent heat which attends the hea\'y condensation of aqueous vapour.

   In winter, however, and owing to the same influences, the thermometer at
Yakoutsk, annually for about two weeks, sinks fidl 100° below the mean winter
temperatm-e in Iceland. The difference between continental and marine climates

becomes more marked, not only as we approach the Pole, but as the places ai'o more

or less contiguous to the open sea, and exposed to west winds from the ocean or

dry winds from the land. Indeed, the summers of Yakoutsk are warm enough to
grow vegetables, ripen frmts, and aflbrd gi-ass for cattle.

   The climates of all the lands whicli have been visited in liigh southern latitudes
are eminently marine. In marine climates the simimer is cool, the winters warm

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

take for types the British Isles and Canada. There is not, during the Antarctic
summer, wannth enough in the solar ray to call into play any vegetable forces be-
j'Ond the feeble energies of mosses and lichens. There, as in Iceland and aU other
marine places, there is comparatively but little difference between the sunmier and

winter cUmates. The mean difference between the average winter and average
summer temperature in the Antarctic, as indicated by the South Shetland obseiwa-

tions, is less than the change often experienced with us here between the tempera-
tm'e of the evening and the morning of the same day.

   Cool suiTuners, wann winters, and evenness of tcmperatm-e the year roimd being
the characteristics of marine climates, we should look for great imiformity in those

of high southern latitudes. It is their extraordinarily cool summers, as reported by
navigators, which have created the impression in nautical cu'cles that the cold of
the Antarctic winter is far more exti-eme than that of the Ai-ctic. This was the im-

pression made upon the mind of Cook, the bravest of the brave. He was a close

observer, and there is no authority which to this day has more weight in seafixring
circles, and none which requires more stubborn facts to set aside.

   On the 14th of January, eighty odd yeai-s ago, that accomplished navigator dis-

covered (it being then midsimimer of the southern hemisphere) an island in lat. 54°

and 55° S., which corresponds in lat. with L-eland. On the 17th he landed to
take possession of it. He caUed it Georgia, but did not think " any one would ever

be benefited by this discovery," for its "valleys lay covered with everlasting snow,"

and " not a tree was to be seen, not a slirub even big enough to make a tooth-

pick."

   Contemplating this, to him, strange climate, he remarks, "who would have thought

that an island of no greater extent than this, situated between the latitude of 54°

and 55°, should, in the very height of siunmer, be in a manner wholly covered many

fathoms deep with frozen snow r"'
   But pushing on still further, vdth that prowess and intrepidity which makes hia

history so romantic and himself the pictm-esque man of the sea, he discovered Sand-
wich Land, in lat. 59°-G0°, when he made " bold enough to say that no man would

ever venture fiuther ; that the lands to the south woidd never be explored, for they
were doomed by natm-eto pei-petual fr-igidness, never to feel the warmth of the sun 3

rays ; whose horrible and savage aspect" he had not words to describe.
   In all these specidations, however, he was mistaken, for other explorers have gone

fiu-ther south ; and tlie very islands that in his opinion were never to benefit any one,

have afforded to commerce seal-skins and oil to the value of many millions oi dol-
lars, and, with the island that he named Desolation, from its aspect, still give em-
ployment annually, or did a few years ago (Weddell), to 2000 tons of shipping and

200 or 300 seamen.

myNo explorer has yet tried the Antarctic vdnter. There is,  investigations lead

me to believe, no gi'eat difference between it and the Antarctic summer ; and the

erroneous impression that has fastened itself on the public mind as to the extreme

severity of winter about the South Pole, has no doubt its root in the low summer

temperatm'es that prevail there.

If, in pleading the cause of Antarctic exploration, I be required to answer first

the question of cui bono ? which is so apt to be put, I reply, it is enough for me,

when contemplating the vast extent of that unknown region, to know that it is a
part of the sm-face of om- planet, and to remember that the earth was made for man ;

that all knowledge is profitable ; that no discoveries have conferred more honour

and glory vipon the age in which they were made, or been more beneficial to the

world, than geographical discoveries ; and that never were nations so well prepared

to undertake Antarctic exploration as are those that I now solicit. The last who

essayed it reached furthest ; they were Billinghausen of Eussia, forty years ago,

--Admiral d'Ui-ville of France, Ross of England, and Wilkes of America, all about

the same time, and nearly a quarter of a centuiy ago. But since that time the

world has grown in knowledge, and man has gained wonderfully in his power for

Weconquest in this field of research.  have now the sea-steamer, which former

Arctic explorers had not ; the experience acquired since their day, in polar explora-

tion about the i\i'ctic regions, euables us to overcome many an obstacle that loomed

up before them in tndy formidable proportions. The gold of Australia has built

up among the antipodes of Em-ope one of the most extensive shipping ports in the

world. By steam, it is within less than a week's sailing distance of the Antarctic

Circle ; and thus those unknown regions of the south, instead of being far remote,
as in the time of all previous explorers they were, have, since exploration was last

attempted there, been actually brought within a few days' sail of a great commercial

mart, with its storas, its supplies, and resources of all kinds. The advantages and

facilities for Antarctic exploration are inconceivably greater now than in the days

of Cook and others. They are gxeatly enhanced by the joint system of national

cooperation for the purpose of searching out the mysteries of the sea, now recognized

and practised by all maritime nations. In this beautifid and beneficial cooperation,

oflicers of the difiercnt nations have learned to pidl and work together for a conmion

good and a common glory. This habit would be carried to the South Pole by co-

operation among the different nations concerned in sending out vessels for explora-

tion there.

   Nay, that great unexplored area lies at the very doors of one of the powers that
is most renowned in this field of discovery. She too has taken a prominent part in
this joint system of philosophical research, which has converted our ships of war

into temples of science as well, and literally studded the sea with floating observa-

tories. France, also renowned for the achievements won by her navy in peace as

well as in war, is also, with her colonies, but a little further olf ; and the hardy Dutch
are hard by. They, too, as well as the Portuguese, Spaniards, Russians, and Italians,

have won renovra in the field of maritime exploration. Their traditions now help
                                                                             ?

me to plead the cause of Antarctic exploration. For them, with all the facilities with
which we are now surroimded, with their accomplished olRcers and daring seamen
who have given lustre to their flags, hoth in peace and in war, it woidd he an easy
task now to vnhar the Gates of the South. But in this, men and officers in other

navies will also claim the privilege to join; and since all Hags are alike interested

and concerned in developing the physics of the sea, and in bringing to light its

hidden things, it is hut fair that all who are cooperating in this system of research

shoidd have "chance and opportmiity" for the laurels that ai'e to be gathered there.

  Therefore, instead of conhuing my appeals upon this subject to my own or any one

govemment, I venture respectfully to bring it to the attention of all.
   The iirst step, I submit, should be to send a steamer down from Australia to search

for one or more ports or places where the exploring vessels that are to follow may

iind shelter, and whence they might despatch boat- or land- or ice-parties, accord-

ing to circumstances. This reconnaissance alone would occupy one season.

Tlie next season, vessels suitably equipped for two or three years might bo sent

to take up their position, where at the retmii of siunmer they might be visited from
Melbourne again, and arrangements made for the next season.

   For many seasons this exploration should be a joint one among the nations that
are most concerned in maritime pursuits. The advantages are manifold : each one of
the cooperating powers, inslead of equipping a squadron at its own expense, would

only furnish one or two steamers ; and these shoidd not be large, nor should their

cost be extravagant. Thus the expenses of a thorough Antarctic exploration, like

those for cai'rying on the " Wind and CuiTcnt Charts," may be so subdivided among

--the nations concerned as literally to be " almost nothing. " It would also be at-

tended by this further and great advantage such an expedition could have eeveral

centres of exploration. The officers and men under each flag would naturally be
incited by the most zealous and active emidation. They would strive so much the

more earnestly not to be outdone in pushing on the glorious conquest.

  Now the question is, what mode of procedure is best calculated successfully to

bring this subject to the notice of the proper authorities in jour country'

I leave that to you and other friends, trusting to thcra to invoke suen means and

to take such steps as, to them, the importance of the subject and the interests of the

loint system of research, in which we and our ilags are enlisted for the increase of
knowledge among men, may seem to require.

On an Anemometer for Beriisterinq the Maximum. Force and extreme Variation
      of the Wind. By John E. Morgan, M.A., M.B. Oxon., M.E.C.P.

   The author described the instrument as consisting of an iron stand supporting a
spindle. On the top of the spindle revolves a boss, on which rests a fi-ame 1.3 inches

^in length by in \\'idth. This frame is maintained in the direction of the wind

by means of two vanes, facing each other at an angle, the more open end of the

Aangle being directed towards the spindle. small car with flanged wheels traverses

the frame. To the face of tlie car is attached a thin metal plate 6 inches square,

and to the back a catch playing freelj' over some rack-work. This catch permits
the car to move towards the vanes, but checks its return to the spindle. 1 he face

of the car is connected with a balance contrived on a somewhat novel principle by

means of a loaded wheel, and a lever with a weight at its lower end. By means of
tills balance the resistance to the progress of the car increases with its advance. The

ratio of this increase is expressed in ounces and pounds engraved on one side of the

Afi-ame.  hand projecting from the car moves over the scale on the datuig index.

The scale rises from ^ of an ounce to 7 lbs. As the surface presented to tlie wind

is fi inches square, the pressure on the square foot will be exactly four times that

indicated on the fi'ame. The amount of variation in the direction of the wind, in a

given space of time, is shown by means of tv\o hands, which project from the spindle,

and are capable of being directed to any part of a dial plate, on which the points of

the compass ai-e engi-aved by means of a rod, which is attached to, and revolves with

   This wind-gauge may prove useful in rifle practice and on numerous other occa-
sions when it is importixnt to bo acquainted with the actual pressure of the wind.

Meteoroloc/ical Observations at Hur/gate, Yorlisldre. Bij the Rev. T. Eankin,

has annually presented to the Association for upwards of twenty years.

  On a BatJiometer, or Instrument to indimte the Depth of the Sea on Board
              Ship luithout submerging a Line. Bij C. W. Siemens.

  Those who are acquainted with the difficulties and expense attending tho taking

of deep-sea soundings bv means of a weighted line, will readily perceive that an
instrument capable of inc\icating depths upon a graduated scale without submerging
any apparatus would be of great advantage as a means of extending our knowledge
of ocean geography. In layiug submarine telegraph cables through deep seas such
an instrument would certainly bo invaluable.

   It occurred to Mr. Siemens that the total attractive force of the earth must be
sensibly influenced by the interposition of a comparatively light substance, such as
sea-water, bet'ween the vessel and the solid portion of the earth below. This he
demonstrated geometrically as follows :

   Assuming the earth to be a perfect sphere of unifomi density, two lines are drawn
from a point on the surface, so as to intersect the circumference at the semicircles.

A line is then dra'wai through the two points of intei-section, which passes through

the earth's centre, and a second line parallel to it, touching the circle at its lowest
point. It was next demonstrated that in dividing the solid cone represented by
these lines into a number of slices of equal thickness, in a direction perpendicular
to its axis, each slice woiild exercise the same amomit of attractive force upon a
body at the apex of the cone, the reason being that the mass of each slice increases
in the proportion of tho square of its distance from the apex, and the attractive force
diminishes in the same ratio. It was thus demonstrated that the true centre of
gravity of the earth, in reference to an attracted body on its surface, does not reside
in its geometrical centre, but in a variable point between the centre and the attracted
body. In dividing the sphere itself into slices of equal thiclmess, a mathematical
expression was obtained representing the attractive force of any of these slices ; and
in integi-ating this expression for a series of slices commencing from the point of

attraction, a fonnula was amved at, showing that for moderate depths the attrac-
tion of the earth may be represented by a veiy obtuse cone with two-thirds of the

earth's radius for its height If sea-water were of no weight, the total attraction of
the eai-tli would be diminished upon its surface in the proportion of tho depth to
two-thirds of the earth's radius ; but considering that sea-water has about one-third
the weight (bulk for bulk) of the generality of rock, the actual diminution of gi-a-
vitation was sho-\ra to take place in the proportion of the depth to the radius of the

earth.

  --Accordingly 1000 fathoms of depth woidd produce a diminution by -jaV^*^ P^rt

of the total gravitation a difference so small that it appears at tirst sight impossible
to construct an instrument capable of indicating it with sufficient accuracy.

   The second part ot the paper described the instrument designed for this pui-pose,
which consists of a tube containing mercury, diluted spirits of wine, and coloured
iuniper oil. The mercuiy column, about 30 inches high, ascends in a tube from the
bottom of a large bulb containing imprisoned air, and terminates in the middle of a
second bulb. The remainder of the second bulb is filled with the diluted spirits,
which reach upward into a narrow tube provided with a scale. Upon this rests a

--column of the coloured oil, which terminates in a third bulb, the remaining space

being vacuous, or nearly so. This gauge is enclosed in a glass tube fllled with
distilled water, which in its turn is surrounded with ice contained in an outer

casing. The latter is suspended by a imiversal joint. The air in the lower bulb
--141 REPORT 1861

being maintamed in this way at a perfectly uniform temperature, will oppose a
uniform elastic force against the column of mercury, which latter, being removed

from all atmospheric influences, fau-ly represents the gravitation of the earth.
   In moving this insti-ument fi,'om shallow water upon a sea of 1000 fathoms depth,

the mercury column would rise -j-s^j-jth part of its length in the second bidb ; but
before any sensible alteration has taken place in the merciuy level, the upper surfiice
of the spirits of wine terminating in the narrow tube will have risen sufficiently to
restore the balance of pressure, and the spirits being twentj' times lighter than
mercmy, the scale of observation will be increased twentyfold. Lut the spirit
cokmm, in rising, displaces oil of veiy nearly the same specific gravity, which

causes another increase of scale at least twentyfold. By these means a scale of

3 inches per 1000 fathoms of depth is obtained.

  An instrument of this description was tried, by pennission of the Admiralty, and

although it was still imperfect in some respects, its indications agreed generally
within 10 per cent, with the results of actual soimdmgs. In the course of the in-
teresting discussion which ensued. Professor Tyndall suggested that the instrument
would be equally applicable for measuring heights, and he proposed to try it with
Mr. Siemens on the Cumberland Hills at some future time.

   Branching off from the side of the stem of this insti-ument and connected with

the capillaiy bore, we have a chamber the diameter of which is much wider than

the capillary bore. This chamber is abruptly attached at its extremity to another

chamber of smaller bore than itself, but still mder than the capUlary tube.
   To set this instrument, incline it slightly until the mercury in the side chamber

comes to the abrupt termination between the two chambers. The mercuiy in the
capillary tube will now denote the true temperatiu'e. Let this be G0°. If the
temperature rise above 60°, the rise wUl take place in the side tube, and if it then
begin to fall, the fall will also take place in the side tube until it reaches 00° ; but
below that the fall will take place in the capillary tube, as there is a disinclination
of the mercury to recede from the abrupt termination between the two chambers
towards the capillary tube. The instrument thus acts as a minimum thermometer.

quoting several of the most important opinions, ho stated that, in the hope of

CHEMISTET.

Address hy "W. A. Miilt?e, M.D., F.R.S. SjX., Professor of Chemistry,
                                    Kiny's CoUeye, London.

In opening the proceedings, the President said that in the home of Dalton, in

the focus of applied cliemistry, veiy few words would be necessary. They could

not but remember that, on the last occasion when the Meeting of the British Asso-

ciation was held in Manchester, that Ulustrious philosopher was still amongst them

and he trusted that the same spirit which actuated Dalton still remained in Man-

chester to enlighten his native coimty. Without saying more by way of intro-

duction, he would call their attention to one or two points of progress diuing the

--East year. In calling attention to these subjects, he must necessarily refer to de-
 atable groimd in science, but it was in debatable land that progress was neces-

sarily made. He would only touch upon two or three practical applications of

chemistry, and two or three theoretical ideas which had been propomided since

they last met. The Professor then alluded to the new methods of preparing

oxygen and hydrogen, proposed by Deville, which admit of application on such

a scale as to allow of the generation of oxygen for manulacturing purposes,

and the employment of the oxyhydrogen blast as a soui-ce of heat in metal-

lurgical operations. The novelty in tho preparation of oxygen consists in decom-

posing the vapour of sulphuric acid, and, by a fiu'ther process, storing up the oxy-

gen in gas-holders. The preparation of hydrogen required more care. Ihe metal-

lurgy of platinum had already experienced a remarkable modification, owing to tho

application of the intense but manageable source of heat obtained by the combus-

tion of these gases. In connexion with oxygen might be mentioned a singadar

circumstance regarding ozone, which, according to the obsei-vation of Schrotter,

had been found in a pecidiar species of fluor spar, from Wolsendorf, which, when

nibbed or broken, emitted a pecidiar odoiu- of ozone. The active chemist DeviUe,

in foUovring his researches, had discovered a variety of means of obtaining artifi-

cially, crystallized minerals of great regvdarity and beauty. The methods adopted

were chiefly by heating the amorphous substances in a slow current of some gas,

such as hydrochloric acid, which was not an unfrequent natural product in volcanic

districts. No discovery, however, had made a gi-eater impression upon the popular

mind than that of the remarkable alkaline metals cassium and rubidium by Kirch-

hoff' and Bimsen. These eminent men, in investigating the appearances presented

by flames coloured by various metallic salts when analysed by the prism, were led,

from the appearance of certain bright lines in the spectra, produced whilst they

were examining a saline residuum from the waters of the Diirkheim spring, to

infer the existence of a substance hitherto imknown. It was found that caesium

was present in such minute quantity, that a ton of that water, which was the most

abimdant source of ctesimn yet known, contained only 3 gTains of its chloride.

Taking into account the minuteness of the quantity, and its striking resemblance

to potassium, it was not too much to say that the discovery of coesiimi would have
been impossible by any other known method than that which was actually em-

ployed. The other metal, rubidium, was somewhat more plentifid ; but rubidium

also so closely resembled potash that it would not have been discovered but for

the peculiarity of its spectrum. lieferring to the revision of the atomic Aveights of

sulphur, sUver, initrogen, potassium, sodium, and lead, by Stas, Professor Miller

said that chemist had come to the conclusion that it was not proved that the ele-

mentary bodies were midtiples of the unit of hydrogen, and, in opposition to the

opinion of Dumas, he had pronounced the law of Prout as imaginary. Every

chemist would read with interest the paper by Graham iipon the application of
liquid difiiision to analysis. The remarkable conclusion to which the author arrived

was, that the process of difiiision separated all substances into one or other of two

classes, which he distinguished as crystalloids and colloids. The rapid improve-

ment in the method of analysis, though not admitting on that occasion of detailed
Amention, must not be overlooked.
                                   variety of bodies, formerly supposed to be of

rare oceun-ence, were now foimd in minute quantities, unexpectedly, but widely

diflused. The discovery of these small quantities was by no means unimportant,

for they might aid in solving problems of great interest. Glanciag only for a

Miller referred to tlie acti\ity cniploj-cd in the pursuit of the organic department
of chemical science ; reniarkinj; upon two lines of research as important from their
theoretical bearings, namely tlie investigation of polyatomic compounds, and the
process of oxidation and of reduction, applied by various chemists, and by Kolbe

in particular, to the in^"estigation of the organic acids. The laboiu'S of Hofmaun
upon the polyatomic bases showed completely the principle upon which these
bodies might be formed, and he had been enabled to group an imlimited number
of atoms of ammonia into one compound molecule. Great progress had also been
made in our knowledge of the relations of the organic acids.

0)1 the Constitution of Paranaphthaline or Anthracene, and some of its Decom-

             position Prodticts. By Professor Andeeson, F.B.S.E.

The author, after referring to the previous investigations of Laui-ent and Dimias,

which indicated the isomerism of naphthaline and anthracene, detailed the residts

of his own researches, which have established for the latter substance the fonnula

C2R H,(,. Anthracene, when treated with nitric acid, undergoes a decomposition

entirely difierent from that of naphthaline under similar circumstances, and yields

an oxidized compound, oxanthracene, C,,i, 11^ 0,,, which is volatile without decom-

position, and crystallizes in fine needles of a pale butf colour. Bromine gives

C2, H,,, Br,, in small hard crj'stals apparently rhombohedral, which when digested

with  alcoholic  potash  give                                                Cj,  H,  Er;  in  fine  sulphur-yellow  crystals.  Cliloiine

gives Cj, H,,, CI2, and this with alkalies yields Cj^ H,, CI.

These and other details contained in the paper show that anthracene is not

isomeric with naphthaline, but they connect it with the benzoyl series, and more
especially with stilbene, fi-oni which it differs by Hj ; while oxanthracene and benzil
are similarly related to one another, as shown by the following comparison of their

formula; :

      On the Effect of Great Pressures comhined ivith Cold on the Six Non-

              condcnsahJe Gases. Bij Professor Andrews, M.D., F.R.S.

   In this communication the author gave an account of some results already
obtained in a research with which he is still occupied on the changes of physical
state which occm- when the non-condensable gases are exposed to the conibined
action of gi'eat pressiues and low temperatures. The gases when compressed were
always obtained in the cnpillary end of thick glass tubes, so that any change they

might imdergo coidd be obsened. In his earlier expeiiments the author employeil

the elastic force of the gases evolved in the electrolysis of water as the compressing

agent, and in this way he actuallj- succeeded in reducing oxygen gas to -j-J-oth of
its volume at the ordinaiy pressure of the atmosphere. He afterwards succeeded

in efiecting the same object by mechanical means, and exhibited to the Section an

apparatus by means of which he had been able to apply pressures, which were only

limited by the capability' of the capillary glass tubes to resist them; and while thus

compressed the gases were exposed to the cold attained by the carbonic acid and

^yether bath. Atmospheric air was compressed by pressm-e alone to                                                    of its original

volume, and by the united action of pressure and a cold of-- 106° i\ to eTT*^'; i"

which state its density was little inferior to that of water. Oxygen gas was reduced

by pressure to ^^^th of its volume, and by pressm-e and cold to J-jth ; hj'drogen

by the united action of cold and pressiu-e to --^th ; carbonic oxide by pressure to

^yth, by pressure and cold to ^nr^h ; nitric oxide by pressure to 3-|7ftn, by pres-

sure and' a cold of-- 1G0° F. to ^-gi^th. None of the gases exhibited any appearimce

of liquefaction even in these high states of condensation. The amount of contrac-

tion was nearly proportional to the force employed, till the gases were reduced

to from about -j^lroth to -^l^ih. of their volmne ; but, beyond that point, tliey under-

went little further diminution of volume from increase of pressure, llydrogen

and carbonic oxido appear to resist the action of pressure better than oxygen or

nitric oxido.

On the Chemical Composition of some Woods employed in the Navy.
                      By Dr. Grace C.vlvert, F.B.S.

   The author thought that it mirrht prove interesting to ship-builders if he were to
investigate the chemical composition of the various woods employed in the Navy

especially when this important adjunct of England's wealth is undergoing such
extensive modifications, and when it is of such paramount importance to know

which is the best wood to bo used in the construction of the new iron-plated
frigates. He had examined ten different woods, and the superiority of some foreign

woods over English oak could not be too strongly expressed. If English oak has

hitherto stood so high, it must have been owing to our ignorance of the valuable

properties of some of the woods gTOwn in tropical climates, in which the soluble

and highly decomposable tannin of oak is replaced in some instances by resins, and

in others by substances similar to caoutchouc. This is the case with Moulmein

teak', Santa Maria, Moira wood, and Honduras mahogany, which gives to them a

great advantage over oak for iron ship-building. Thus he has found that in tho

same time, and under similar circiuustances, oak will attack iron twice and three

times as rapidly as the woods above-mentioned. He has also remarked that if cubes

of the same dimensions of the various kinds of wood remain in contact with water

for five months, they lose respectively tho follomng per-centages of their sub-

--stance : Unseasoned oak, 24 ; seasoned oak, 12 ; iSJiican teak, 3^ ; Moira wood, 4

Honduras, .3; Santa Maria, 1-G; Greenheart, 5-6; Moulmein teak, 1-7. The
--facility of mildewing or decaying is as follows :
                                                     Unseasoned oak, rapid seasoned
                                                                                                                                                               ;

oak, much less : Afi'ican teak and Honduras mahogany, limited ; Moira wood, Santa

Maria, and Moulmein teak, none. For fiu-ther details Mr. Grace Calvert woidd

avail himself of an early opportunity of publishing a complete paper ; but there

was one point which he deemed it his duty to mention at once. During his

researches he had found a great difference between oak" felled in summer and that

felled in winter, viz. that the oak felled in winter was rich in tannin, while the

oak felled in summer contained little or no tannin, but a large quantity of gallic

acid ; and on examining some specimens of wood from unsoimd gun-boats furnished

to him by some of Her Majesty's Officials, he found that tho chemical composition

of the wood of the soimd gun-boat was identical with that of well-seasoned oak,

while the composition of the wood of the imsoimd gun-boat was identical with that

of unseasoned summer-felled oalc.

    On the Chemical Composition of Steel. By Dr. Ceace Calteet, F.E.S.

   Tho author entered into some detail respecting tho interesting discussion
which has lately taken place before the French Academy of Science, between

MM. Fremy and Garon, on the chemical composition of steel, the former contend-

ing that nitrogen is essential to the conversion of iron into steel, the latter that

carbon alone is sufficient to effect that object. But an observation that Mr. Grace
Calvert has made, tends to show that the molecular condition of steel has a great
deal to do with^the nature of its chemical composition ; for if a piece of soft steel be
divided into two portions, and one of these is hardened or highly tempered, the
slow action of acetic acid proves to be quite different ; and whilst soft steel is scarcely
acted upon by weak acetic acid, hard steel is rapidly dissolved. Further, the soft
steel leaves a homogeneous gTey carburet of iron, similar in its texture to the gTa-
phitoid compoimd lately described by him (Mr. Calvert), whilst that of tempered
steel is black, possesses no cohesion, and has the appearance of pure carbon.

                     On the Evolution of Ammonia from Volcanos.
                        By Professor Daubent, M.D., F.B.S.

   This phenomenon had been ascribed b}' Bischof to the decomposition of bitu-
minous matters by volcanic heat; by Buusen to the lava flowing over herbage, and
disengaging its nitrogen, which exhibited itself in the form of ammonia ; and on
former occasions, by tho author of this paper, to the direct union of hydrogen and
nitrogen in the interior of the earth under an enormous pressure. Now, however,
that Wtihler has shown the affinity which subsists between nitrogen and certain of
the metals and simple combustibles, somo of which, as titanium or boron, combine

with it dii"cctly with such avidity that the union is attended with combustion
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          j

--and that he has also proved the nitrides formed to be decomposed by the hydrated

alkalies, ammonia being thereby generated, it has occuiTed to the author that a
more probable explanation of the occurrence of ammonia in Tolcanos might be
afforded by supposing such combinations to take place in the interior of the earth,
and there to be subsequently decomposed by the alkalies which are usually present

wherever volcanic action is taking place. In confirmation of this view, he appealed

to a late observation made by Signer Guiscardi, a distingiiished naturalist at Naples,
namely, that metallic titanium was fovmd to be evolved from the crater of Vesuvius

during a late eruption.

On a particular Decomposition of Ancient Glass, By H. Dbaite.

   The author's object was to show, first, that an inci-ustation obser\-ed within a glass

ampulla from the ancient Christian catacombs of Home was not organic matter, as

had been  supposed                                             and  secondly,  that  it was the  result  of  a decomposition  of the
                                                            ;

glass itself, probably originally coloiu-ed with peroxide of iron. This in the coiu'se

of time had separated, like the other ingredients of the glass, and found its way to

the surface in a spheroidal and arborescent form, similar to what may be observed

in moss agates. That it was not a mere extraneous deposit was obvious from the

fact of its being chiefly in the substance of the glass itselfj and nearly equally

disti'ibuted on both inner and outer smfaces. He had observed precisely the same

condition in some ancient glass from Nineveh,

    On Morin, and the non-eaistence of Morotannic acid. By Dr. Delffs,

   M. Wagner published in the year 1850 an investigation on the wood of 3Iorus
tinctoria, and stated that this wood contains two peculiar and isomeric matters,
morin and morotannic acid, the latter of which differs from all other tannic sub-

stances by being able to crystallize. Since that time no other chemist has discussed
the same subject. The author thought, therefore, a repeated investigation on morin
and morotannic acid would not be superfluous, and fx)und that morotannic acid is
only morin in an irapiu'e state, and that an often-iterated crystallization suffices to
convert it bito a white substance possessing all the properties of pure morin. The

+composition of morin con-esponds to the foniiula C^^ IP 0'^ 2 110. M. Wag-ner

gives the fommla C'lPO^". Moiiu most resembles catechin: it giyes, when

heated above its melting-point, pyi-ocatechic acid ; the colour produced in the sohi-
tion of catechin by chloride of iron is nearly identical with that which is caused
by the same test in the solution of impure morin ; and a comparison of the com-
position of catechin, which Dr. Delfl's fomid seventeen years ago (Jahrbuch fiir

praktische Phannacie, vol. xii. p. 162), and that of morin will show that the diflbr-
ence between both is not very great. The author tried, therefore, to convert
catechin by repeated ciystallizatiou into morin, but without result, and he is quite
convinced that these two substances are not identical.

   In an old clialk-pit at Hove there are many faults, and some of these are filled

up with a white soft miaeral that runs along- the broken layers of flint and imbeds
the fragments. It appears in agglomerated masses, which easily fall to powder,
and are porous. Sp. gr. 1-99. One piece that was analysed proved to be the hydrated
disilicate of almnina, that has received the name of CoUyrite, with no other im-
purity than one per cent, of carbonate of lime. Another piece contained 13 per
cent, of carbonate of lime, and 5 per cent, additional of carbonic acid, which was
supposed to be combined with ahmiina. As the silicic acid was proportionally
smaller in quantity, this piece was \-iewed as coUyrite in which about halt the silicic

acid had been replaced by carbonic acid.

On the Emission and Absorption of Rays of Liglit hy certain Gases.
                       [By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.E.S.

This communication arose out of an attempt to detei-mine what constituents of

the air give rise to the "atmospheric lines" of the solar spectrum, of which a map

had been exhibited by the author at the Leeds Meeting of the Association, and

which had been since published in a more complete form by Sir David Brewster and

Ahimself  comparison of the bright rays emitted by nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen,

carbonic acid, and water, when strongly heated, had shown that they do not coin-

cide with the absorption-bands of the atmosphere. It is possible that the three

bright lines of the hydrogen specti'um, as given by Angstrom and Pliicker, may be

in the same position as 01, F, and p of the atmospheiic spectrum. Yet the author
inclined to the belief that these absorption-bauds are due to two or more different

constituents in varying proportions, more abundant in some places than in others,

and probably in very mmute quantities.

 --The following facts were mentioned among others : The flame of carbonic oxide

burning in air gave a continuous spectnmi from about C to about k, where it ceased

rather abruptly: it was without either bright or dark lines. The alcohol flame

-- D Eshows four bands the first faint in the yellow, nearly midway between and

the second brighter, green, just beyond b, with the refractive index 1'6254 for glass,

which gives as the refractive index of b 1-6249; the third faiat and blue, about

F Ghalf-way between and ; the foui-th a more luminous double line, violet, with
Gthe refi'active index 1-6413, that of the line being 1-6404. The oxyhydrogen

flame gave a contiuuous spectrum principally green and blue, extending to about

G 33, with no lines corresponding to the hydi-ogen lines of Angstrom and Pliicker,

The lightning- flash gave a continuous spectnmi, showing all the colom-s from red

to \ioIet, -with doubtfril indications of more luminous bands. That there is no

necessary coiTespondeuce between the lines of absorption of a gas at the ordinary

teniperatiu-e, and the rays emitted by it at a high temperature, is sti-ikingly proved

by iodine, where the absoi-ption-bands delineated by Professor Miller, the groups

of green caud blue bands produced when the vapour is introduced into a Bunsen's

flame, and the lines of the rarefied gas as observed by Pliicker, are perfectly dif-

ferent. By the prismatic analysis of solar light, the absence of the colom-ed gases

from the air can be proved, even in very minute quantity. Thus the author

observed that about y^th of an inch of bromine vapour interposed between the

eye and the object-glass of the refi-action goniometer was suflicient to exhibit the

absorption-bands ; and fi-om this he had reckoned that if free bromine constituted

one thousand millionth part of the atmosphere, it would betray its presence in the
solar specti-iim when the sun was on the horizon ; but there is no such indication.

This, however, rests on the improved assumption that a gas almost infinitely

difiiised along a given line will produce the same absorbent efiect as if its particles

were all close together at some point along that line.

On ilie Ilisfori/ of the Alkali Manufacture. By W. Gossage.

The author believed that the manufiicture of soda in Great Rritain, by tlie special

decomposition of common salt, had its commencement in Lancashire ; at any rate,

its largest develminient had taken place in this county. Previously to the esta-

blishment of the French republic, in 1/93, soda was obtained almost entirely from the

ashes of marine plants gi'owing at Alicante in Spain, Sicily, Teneriffe, and on the

coast of Great Britain. Large qu.antities of potash were also imported from Russia

and America, but now soda was exported to those countries which formerly sent

us potash. The importation of alkali into France being stopped by the French re-

volution, a committee was appointed by the French convention to discover means

of supplj-ing the article from France itself. The process suggested by Le Blanc

was approved of; but it was erroneous to suppose that his process was not invented

before the committee was appointed. Having given an account of Lo Blanc's

invention, Mr. Gossage said tliat it was very complete, and was the same as now

miised both England and France. This invention had done more to promote

civilization than any other chemical manufiicture. The poor inventor, however,

met with the too common reward of talent, and after gi-eat privations died in an

asylum for paupers. Sundry alkali works were erected in France ; but the process
was not introduced into England until some years afterwards. In 1787 Messrs.

Gordon, Barron, and Co., of Aberdeen, applied chlorine, then recently discovered,

Ato the process of bleaching.  lar^e establishment was in the following year

established at Bolton. At first chlonne was used in the state of solution in water,

but the inconvenience of using it in that manner was overcome by the addition of

potash to the water. The next step was to substitute lime for potash, producing

solution of chloride of lime. This was the invention of ilr. Charles Tennant, of

St. Rollox, who aftei-wards manufactured chloride of lime in the state of powder.

AThis manufactOTe was canied out to a great extent.  gTeat obstruction to the

manufacture, however, was the high excise-duty on salt, which operated most in-

juriously. When Mr. Tennant's patent for manufacturing bleaching powder expired,

other parties began the same manufacture. Attention was directed to the utiliza-

tion of the mixed sulphate of soda and sulphate of manganese resulting from this

manufacture, and carbonate of soda, in crystals, was gi'aduaUy introduced into the

market. During the same period Mr. Losh was making crystals of soda, and might

be considered the father of the soda trade in this countrj'. Mr. Losh finished his

education on the continent, where lie learnt Le Blanc's processes. After his return,

he obtained permission of Government to work a spring of weak brine discovered

at Walker, on the Tyne, for the manufacture of soda. He there manufactured soda

ciystals ; but notwithstanding these essays, 1823 might be considered the natal

year of the soda trade as a special manufacture in Great Britain. In that year

common salt beino- relieved from fiscal impost, Mr. James Muspratt commenced

the manufacture ot sulphate of soda at Liverjiool, to be used for the manufacture

of carbonate of soda. Sir. Muspratt adopted Le Blanc's processes in their entirety.

He had to contend with many difficidties, but he overcame them all, and reaped a

satisfactory reward. Other manufacturers also commenced to make sulphate of

soda, by the special decomposition of common salt for the pui-pose of making soda

and it had since been found advantageous to adapt this method of working to

the production of bleaching powder, by using the nydrochloric acid so obtained

to generate chlorine by its action on manganese. In the early days of the soda
trade no attempt was made to condense the liberated hydrochloric acid gas. The

old apparatus of cylinders and Woulfe's bottles was totally inadequate for the

condensing. Many plans were suggested, and amongst others ho (Mr. Gossage)

mobtained a patent 1836. Having demonstrated the practicability of effecting a

complete condensation of hj'drochloric acid, by the erection and working of a set

of apparatus at the soda works with which he was then connected, he introduced the

plan to the trade, and it had been subsequently adopted by every manufacturer.

The principle of the invention consists in causing the acid gas to percolate through
a deep bed of coke, in small lumps, contained in a high tower, at the same time

that a supply of water flowed very slowly over the surface of the pieces of coke.

By this means an almost unlimited extent of moistened surface was presented

to the gas for effecting its absoi-ption, and as the same fluid descended through the

tower, it met with more gaa and gradually became charged to saturation ; whilst,

at the upper portion of the tower, any gas which might otherwise escape was ex-
posed to tlie absorbing power of uuacidiilated water. In 1838, a French house,
Messrs. Taix and Co., of Marseilles, obtained a monopoly from the King of Sicily
for the export of sulphur. This caused an advance in price to £14 per ton, from
the previous rate of £5 per ton. It was found that in our Cornish mines and in
those of Wicklow in Ireland, we possessed an inexhaustible supply of sidphur iu

the form of pyrites ; and our practical chemists soon availed themselves of this
source for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. In working with pyrites it was found

that this mineral contained sulphide of copper as well as sulphide of iron, and at
an early period he commenced to extract the copper from the burnt residuum by

smelting. At the present time, the products obtained by the soda manufacturers
were soda ash, worth £8 per ton ; soda crystals, about £4: 10s. per ton ; bleaching
powder, £9 per ton ; bicarbonate of soda, £10 per ton ; whilst the cost of raw

--materials, now used in Lancashire, is sulphur, £8 per ton, for which was substi-

tuted pyrites at a cost equivalent to £5 per ton ; common salt, 8s. ; limestone, 6s. 8d,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

fuel, 6s. per ton. Thus, with a reduction in the cost of raw materials not more
than equal to 10 per cent, the public was supplied with the products of the soda
manufacturer at a reduction of at least 60 per cent. As nearly as he could obtain
information, there were 50 establishments in Great Britain in which soda was
manufactured by Le Blanc's process, producing about 3000 tons of soda ash, 2000

tons of soda crystals, 250 tons of bicarbonate of soda, and 400 tons of bleaching
powder per week. The total amount of these products might be estimated as

exceeding two millions sterling, which was so much entirely added to the annual

income of the coimtry, excepting about £100,000 paid for materials obtained from

other countries. He must not omit to notice the prospect of a new market for

British-made soda which had been opened by the successful labours of Mr. Cobden,
in negotiating the commercial treaty with the French government.

   Many attempts had been made to supersede Le Blanc's process, by some more
direct means of operating on salt, so as to eliminate its soda at once. Up to the

present time, the result of all these attempts had been the wastefid expenditure of
large sums of money. Two-fifths of the total cost for raw materials was incurred
for pyrites from which to procure a supply of sidphur ; and it was a well-known
fact that more than nine-tenths of this sidphur was retained in the material called
" alkali waste," which was thrown away by the manufacturer. Thus was presented
a problem which, if it coiUd be solved, would effect a large reduction in the cost of

soda. Many chemists, both scientific and practical, had given a gi-eat amount of
attention to the subject. He had been so unfortunate as to be amongst the number,

as he had devoted a great proportion of his time, during a quarter ot a century, and

a large amount of both money and labour to this hitherto delusive subject. He

commenced by demonstrating, in 1838, that one equivalent of carbonic acid would

decompose one equivalent of sulphide of calcium, producing monocarbonate of lime
and sulphide of hydrogen. This decomposition was contrary to the received views
of scientific chemists of that day, as it was held that an excess of carbonic acid was

needful to efi'ect the perfect decomposition of sidphides. He was convinced that

whenever the utilization of the sidphur in alkali waste should be eflected, it would

be by means of this action of carbonic acid. He demonstrated also, at the same

time, that one equivalent of carbonic acid would decompose one equivalent of sul-
phide of sodium, producing monocarbonate of soda and sulphide of hydrogen. His
present impression was that Le Blanc's processes would be modified by the omis-
sion of lime when decomposing sulphide of soda, thus producing sulphide of
sodium ; and that the carbonic acid evolved by this decomposition would be applied
to decompose the sulphide of sodium, producing carbonate of soda, and eliminating
sulphide of hydrogen, which would be absorbed by peroxide of iron, and the pro-

duct used in the manufacture of sidphuric acid. He had proved the correctness of

all those decompositions and actions ; but the ideas had still to be worked into a

practical operation.

They were all formed for burning a mixture of coal-gas and atmospheric air, so
regulated as to produce great heat and no light. The construction of the burners
was explained, and the methods of securing the proper results. The same burner
could be made to give a single large flame for the ig-nition of a crucible, or a gi-eat
number of small flames proper to warm a cun-ent ot air to effect evaporations, &c.
Jackets or furnaces were used for applying the heat produced by the burners so as
to combine the greatest efl'ect with economy in the use of gas. With one of these

burners (the third in the series) five gallons of water could be readily boiled ; a
5-uich clay crucible could be raised to a fidl red heat in less than half an hour ; or

30 lbs. of lead or 20 lbs. of zinc coidd be kept in constant fusion. For very high
temperatures a blast gas furnace is required. The bmner belonging to this appa-

ratus contains sixteen or twenty-six blowpipes which are acted on by a bellows.

With this furnace, a quarter of a hmidi-edweight of cast iron, and smaller quantities
(two or three poimds) of such metals as malleable iron and nickel, can be com-

pletely fused in about an hour.

Note on the Sulphur Compound formed by the Action of Sulphuretted Hydro-

determinations only, the formula ^                                               ^ > S^, and the name thioformic acid, from

a supposed analogy to the thiacetic acid of Kekuli^tj ji ^ ^\ ^2- ^ lately im-

dertook, at Professor Roscoe's suggestion, the following further examination of its

properties and mode of formation.

  (I.) When anhydi'ous formic acid is acted on by pentasulphide of phosphorus,

aa in Kekul^'s experiment, sulphuretted hydrogen is continually evolved, and the

distillate contains no sulphui' in combination.

  (II.) When the mixtm-e is heated in closed tubes to 106° C, or (III.) to the same

temperature under a pressure of three atmospheres, carbonic oxide and sulphuretted
hydrogen are evolved, with similar negative results.

   So (FV. and V.) when formiate of lead and pentasulphide of phosphorus are
distilled together both in the diy and moist state. These facts seem to point to a

decomposition of the thioformic acid, if formed, at the temperatui'e of the experi-

ments. Thus,

   I obtained Limpricht's body by his method, but in much smaller quantities than

he mentions. After purification by repeated ciystallizations from hot formic acid,
and drying in vacuo over sidphuric acid, analyses yielded the following results :

from sulphurous acid. Although these analyses, in the absence of a vapour-density
or atomic weight determination, which the small quantity of the substance did not
permit, yield no definite formida, yet they and the previous experiments show

mclearly that the body is not thioformic acid. It crystallizes readily white shining

                        On the Therymd Effects of Elastic Fluids.
           By Dr. Joule, F.R.S., and Professor W. Thomson, F.B.S.

   In the year 1844, Mr. Joule showed that the thenual effects of compressing au
elastic fluid and of allowing a compressed elastic fluid to expand, were to be explamed

on mechanical piinciples. He demonstrated by experiment that the heat evolved

by the compression of an elastic fluid was proportional and equivalent to the force
employed ; and 2nd, that the cold occasioned by the dilatation of a gas was in con-

sequence of heat turned into work. He also snowed that if the dilatation of a gas is

managed so as to give out no external work, no sensible thermal effect is produced;
Professor Thomson showed that these residts were probably only approximate to
the truth, and would differ from it in proportion as the gas did not observe the so-
called gaseous laws, and he devised the plan of experimenting, which the authors
have since carried on in concert, in order to show the small but certain thermal effect
of expanding elastic fluids without giving oiit work. The method the authors

employed is to allow an elastic fluid confined at high pressure to escape through a

poroiis phig. It is obvious that if the gas obeyed the gaseous laws accurately, no
change of temperatmre would be occasioned by this process, for the cold of dilatation
would be exactly balanced by the heat arising from the friction of the air in the
plug. This is evident from the circumstance that the product of the pressure
through the space would be the same on bofh sides of the plug. Their first expe^
riments, on a very small scale and with a veiy imperfect apparatus, decisively ex-

liibited a lowering of temperature of air on passing through the plug, thus showing
a non-observance of exact gaseous law, which was with difficulty detected by Reg-
nault by the use of a very elaborate and costly method, only applicable to certain

gases imder peculiar conditions.
   The method they employed, though so extremely simple, required several pre-

cautions. In particular it was requisite to employ a porous plug of considerable
thiclmess; for if a thin one was employed there was a rapid conduction of heat from
the high- to the low-pressure side, and also an irregular effect arising from the
action of numerous jets of air instead of a tranquil flow on the low-pressure side.
Hence they fomid a too large cooling effect when a diaphragm of leather was used,
in which case even hydi'ogen showed a slight cooling effect.

   The phenomena of a jet of air are highly interesting. Issuing at a high velocity
from a vessel in which it is confined at high pressure, its actual temperature may
readily be made 200° below the zero of Fahr. But this very low temperature
cannot be easily exhibited, because if a thermometer is immersed in the jet the
friction of the air gives rise to heat which nearly neutralizes the cold. The tem-
perature of one part of a jet may thus be hundreds of degrees different from that of
another part. The authors have, in fact, shown that a thermometer may be so
placed in a jet as to experience either cold or extreme heat. Hence the absolute
necessity in their experiments of a porous plug, which will allow the air to issue in

a tranquil flow without jets or rapids.

  A general result they have anived at on transmitting elastic fluids through a

porous plug, is, that the thermal effect is proportional to the difference of pressures

on the opposite sides.

  A diminution of temperature takes place in all the gases tried except hvdrogen

and this diminution or cooling effect is decreased when the temperature is raised.
                                                                                                         6*

in such sort as to make it certain that at 300° or 400° it would vanish altog-ether
and be followed by a heating effect, as is observed in hydrogen at low temperatures.

    In diflerent gases the cooling- ettect is very various. It is 5 times as great in
carbonic acid as in atmospheric air at low temperatures, and 4 times as gi-eat at
the boiling temperature.

  A very remarkable fact which has been elicited by these experiments, is that a

gas mixed with another does not exhibit the same thermal effects as it does when
tmdiluted. In general a mixtm-e of gases gives a smaller cooling effect than would

be deduced from the cooluig effects of the con.stituents. This has been verified in
the dilutions of carbonic acid and hydrogen and in atmospheric air, of which each
of the component gases has a larger cooling effect than itself

   The authors regret that they have not been able as yet to extend the experiments
so as to show the point at which the cooling effect ceases and is followed by a

heating effect in the different gases.

                071 some points in connexion tvith the Exhaustion of Soils.

  By J. B. Lawes, F.R.S., F.O.S., and Dr. J. 11. Gilbert, F.R.S., F.C.S.

 _ The question of the exhaustion of soils was one of peculiar interest at the present
time, not only on account of the gi'eat attention now paid to the waste of manuring
matters by the discharge of the sewage of towns into our rivers, but also from the
fact that Baron Liebig has recently m-ged that om- soils are suffering progressive
exhaustion from this cause, and predicted certain, though it may be distant, ruin to
the nation, if our present modes of procedure be persevered in.

   The questiftn was one of chemical facts ; and the authors had intended to treat it
much more comprehensively than they were able to do on the present occasion.
They proposed, by way of illustration, to bring forward one special case of pro-
gressive exhaustion, occurring in the course of their o^vn investigations ; and then
to contrast the conditions of that result with those of ordinary agriculture.

   They had gro-\vn wheat for eighteen years consecutively on tlie same land, respect-
ively without manm'e, with farm-yard manure, and with different constituents of
manure, and they had determined the amounts of the different mineral constituents
taken off in the crop from the respective plots. Numerous Tables of the results were
exhibited. The variations in the composition of the ash of both grain and straw,
dependent on variations of season and consequent character of development and
maturity, were first pointed out. The general residt was, that, with an unfavour-
able season, there was a slight though appreciable decrease iu the percentage of lime
and potass, and increase in that of magnesia ; and again, an increase in the percentage
of phosphoric acid and of silica; and, especiallyin the case of the straw-ash, a decrease
in that of sulphuric acid. Turning to the bearing of the results on the main subject
of inquiry, it appeared that when ammonia-salts were used alone, year after year,
on the same land, the composition of the ash, both of grain and of straw, showed an
appreciable decline in the amount of phosphoric acid, and that of the straw a con-

siderable reduction in the percentage of silica.

   When ammonia-salts alone were used, the aniomit of mineral constituents in the

--ci'op of a given area of land was veiy much increased much more so than when a

liberal supply of mineral constituents alone was used. But in neither of these
cases was there anything like the amount of mineral constituents obtained in the
crop, that there was when the ammonia-salts and mineral manures were used to-
gether, or when farm-yard manm'e was employed. The greatest deficiency indi-
cated was in the silica and the phosphoric acid, and next in order came potass and
magnesia. The exhaustion here apparent was, howe^-er, not to be wondered at,
when it is considered that, in these experiments in which both corn and straw were
 annually removed without the usual periodical return of farm-yard manure, there
had been on the average annually taken from the land by the use of ammonia-salts,
about t^^ice as much phosphoric acid, about ti^·e times as much potass, and about
twenty-five times as much silica, as would be removed under a system of ordinary-
rotation with home manm-ing, and selling only't^orn and meat ; in fact, in sixteen
years there had been taken from the land as much phosphoric acid as would require
thirty-two years, as much potass as would require eighty-two years, and as much
 silica as would require 400 yeai-s of such ordinary practice to remove.
                                                                                       :

Lois Weedon, on the growth of wheat j^ear after j-ear on the same land, -nathout

and a half times as nuich phosphoric acid, about se-\-en times as much potass, and
about tliirty-scven times as nuicli silica, as tliere would be in the ordinary course

   The authors did not recommend such exhaustive practice as that quoted from
their O'wn, or the Rev. Mr. Smith's experiments. But the instances given showed
the capabilities of certain soils ; and in one case the conditions under which the
point of comparative exhaustion had been reached. It was, of com'se, impossible to
state the limits of the capability of soils generally, so infinitely varied was their
composition ; but it would be useful to give an illustration on this point. Reckon-
ing the soil to be one foot deep, it was estimated that it would require, of ordi-
nary rotation with home manuring and selling only corn and meat, about 1000
years to exhaust as much phosphoric acid, about 2000 years to exhaust as much
potass, and about 6000 years to exhaust as much silica, as, according to the average

results of forty-two analyses* relating to fourteen soDs of very various descriptions,

had been found to be soluble in dilute hycbochloric acid. Many soils had, doubt-

less, a composition inferior to that here supposed. In a large proportion, however,
the amounts of the above constituents assumed to be soluble in dilute hydrochloric

acid woidd probably be available for plants long before the expiration of the periods
mentioned ; whilst, in a large proportion, there would still be further stores even-

tually available within a greater or a less depth from the surface.

   But the exhaustion of mineral constituents by the sale of com and meat alone

was in reality not so gi-eat, in the ordinary practice of this country, as has been
assimied for the piu^ose of the above illustrations. Wliere there was no purchase
of cattle-food, or of artificial or town manm'es, the sales of com and meat woidd on
the average be much less than were taken in the authors' estimates ; and where such
materials were purcha.sed with any degTCe of j udgment in the selection, there would
always be much more phosphoric acid (othei-wise the most easily exhausted con-
stituent) so brought upon the land, than woidd be obtained from it in the increase
of produce yielded ; in fact, under such conditions, in many soils potass was more
likely to become deficient. Again, by no means the whole of the mineral consti-
tuents sent from the farm in the form of corn and meat will reach the sewers of
our towns, and thence our rivers ; a not inconsiderable portion finding its way back
to the land in some fomi ; in addition to which, imported com, meat, and other
materials will contribute something to the restoration of our own cidtivated land.
It is at the same time certain that so much of the refuse matters of oiu* towns as

becomes diluted with water in the degTeo recognized under the present sewerage

system will be applicable as manure, on the large scale, only to succulent crops, and

especially to grass-land ; and, so far as this is the case, they will of com'se not

directly conti-ibute to the restoration to the land imder tillage, of the mineral con-

stituents sent from it in its produce of corn and meat. When other descriptions of
produce than com and meat, such as roots, hay, or straw, .are largely sold, compen-

sation is generally made by the return to the hand of stable- or town-manures of
some kind. If this be not done, the loss of mineral constituents may indeed be

very considerable.

   In conclusion, whilst the authors insisted upon the importance of applying to
agiicultm-al purposes as much as possible of the valuable manuring matters of our

towns, they at the same time believed that modem practices, taken as a whole, did

not tend to exhaustion in anything like the degree that had been supposed by some.

On the Proportion of Arsenic present in Paper-Hanrjings.

                     By Dr. S. Macadajh,

   The author had been led to the investigation of this subject by hearing of cases
of arsenical poisonings through remaining in rooms with green paperhangings.
In all these cases of which he had heard, the patients soon recovered on being
removed from one room to another. The question whether the arsemc in gi'eeu
paperhangings was injurious to health very much resembled the question regarding

lead, in which it had been stated that a small quantity, though not affecting

one person, might act very injuriously upon another. In most of the green paper-
hangings the arsenic was present in the condition of a rough powder. In some

cases the paper was glazed, which had the effect of protecting the arsenic. He

had examined several green flock papers, and as a general rule he believed fhey did

not contain ai'senic ; but all the common descriptions of gTeen paperhangings did.
He piu-chased two packets of envelopes, the bands around which were coloui-ed
green. In these two bands he found 3'3 gi-ains of arsenic. The common green

paperhangings contained an amount of arsenic varjdng from 1 to 40 grains per

square foot. Taking the mean quantity at 20 gi-ains, a lai-ge-sized room would per-
haps contain 20,000 grains of arsenic in the paper ; a small room 10,000 gi-ains--
quantity capable of producing very serious symptoms. With regard to the mode
in which this ai'senic could be inti-oduced into the system, it was a question whe-
ther arsenic volatilized at ordinary temperatui-es ; but he thought it was not carrying
the point too far to suppose that dui-iug the damp condition of the paper when

being himg, a certain proportion of the arsenic was caiiied off' with the water in
the shape of vapour. It was likely to occm- also dmiug the night, when the exha-

lation of the animal system would produce a moistui-e on the walls as well as the
windows, and when a di-aught was created by the opening- of the door in the morning
a certain portion of the arsenic might be volatilized. It was possibly more liable to be

distm-bed by mechanical action, such as dusting, or the nibbing of di-esses against

the wall, or the gi-azing of bedhangings against the paper. In such cases the
arsenic feU in fine dust upon the cai-pets, and whenever the cai-pets were brushed the

smaU particles would fly about and be iidialed. He had not met with any case of

death thi-ough arsenical poisonings from paperhangings, but he believed it Avas a
medical fact that arsenic taken into the system, even in very small quantities, woidd

soon imdeiinine the health.                .

On the Separation of Ammonia from Coal-gas. By "W. Mabhiott.

In the manufactxire of coal-gas a large quantity of ammonia is generated along

with the permanent gases.    The gi-eater     portion  of  the  ammonia  is  separated  by
                                                                                                                .

cooling or scrubbing, but stiU a considerable portion passes through the lime or

oxide pm-ifier, and so passes along with the gas as caustic arnmonia.

Gas-managers are ftiUy aware of the desirability of removing the ammonia, and

many processes have been devised for this purpose, some of which are in operation i

in different gas-works.

   Of aU the substances which have been used for this purpose sidphuric acid is
perhaps the simplest in its application, and, space and economy considered, the
qmckest in its removal of the ammonia. But there is one great objection in the
use of strong sidphmic acid, namely, that it diminishes the iUimiinating power of

the gas by absorbing the rich hydi-ocarbons.
    If gas is allowed for a length of time to pass through sidphuric acid, a point is

reached when no more of the hydrocarbons are absorbed, after which the gas may

be passed through the acid without injiuy to its illuminating power.
   Acid so prepared is sattirated with carbonaceous matter, and if filtered and

evaporated to dryness, a mass of carbon is left in the dish.
   Now, sulphuric acid so prepared, though it has lost its injurious action on the

gas, retains its affinity for the ammonia.

   It is the above principle of saturating the sulphuric acid mth carbonaceous
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                    87

jnatter which is applied in the material we now use extensively for separating the
ammonia fi-oni coal-gas, with this improvement, that the acid instead of Deing in the

mliquid state is solid, and is at once the purifier converted into crystallized sul-

phate of ammonia.
    In saturating sidphuric acid with carbon it is not necessary to use the gaseous

hydrocarbons, as almost any vegetable matter will do; sawdust is used. The
material is prepared by heating together, at a temperature of about 280° Fahr.,
equal weights of sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1700, and sawdust.

   At that temperatiue the organic matter of the sawdust is broken up, and the
carbon eliminated solidifies the acid ; at the same time the acid dissolves as much

carbonaceous matter as it wUl take up.
   The author cannot say what is the organic compound dissolved by the acid, only

that in this form of satiiration the acid does not in the least injure the illuminating

power of the gases passed through it.

   On accoimt of the immense sm-face of acid exposed to the gas when so prepared,
we are not surprised to find that the ammonia is separated from the gas instantly
it comes in contact with it ; in fact, where we are passin" from 1 to_ 3 millions
feet of gas in 24 hours, we cannot detect any ammonia until the material is satu-

rated to within 1 or 2 inches of the siuiace.

   The material being very porous, oifers very little obstruction to the passage of

the gas, and so scarcely increases the pressure.

   All those who are engaged in the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia from the
ammoniacal liquor obtained from gas-works, well know the great loss of this salt
carried away by the steam, either in evaporating a solution to the crystallizing
poiut, or in passing the ammoniacal vapoui's through the acid. On the large scale

the loss is fi-oni 10 to 20 per cent.
   In the acid prepared as already stated, and converted into sulphate of ammonia,

at the temperature of the gas as it passes through the purifier there is no loss ; for
every equivalent of sulphmic acid used, an equivalent of sulphate of ammonia is
received. In an economical point of view this is a great saving ; but there is still

further economy in the labour, because the very process of removing the ammonia
from the gas converts it into sulphate of ammonia ready for the market.

   The material as discharged from the pmifier contains from 60 to 60 per cent, of

sulphate of ammonia applicable for manure pui-poses.
   The author claimed no novelty, either in the use of sulphuric acid alone or mixed

with sawdust, but thought its application as a free acid, when saturated with car-

bonaceous matter, might be of interest to the Section.

On Madder PhotograjiJis. By John Meecee, F.B.S.

                     On PJiotor/rapJiic Spectra of the Electric Light.
                     By Professor W. A. Miiler, M.D., F.E.S.

   The apparatus by which the spectra may be photographed consists of an ordinary
camera obscm-a attached to the end of a long wooden tube, which opens into a
cylindrical box, within which is a prism glass, or a hoUow prism filled with bisul-

phide of carbon. If the prism be so adjusted as to throw the solar rays, reflected
from a heliostat, upon the screen of a camera, and the wires which transmit the
sparks fi'om Ruhmkoi-lf's coil are placed in front of the imcovered portion of the
slit, the two spectra are simultaneously impressed. The solar beam is easily inter-
cepted at the proper time by means of a small screen, and the electric spectmm is al-

lowed to continue its action for two or three, or six minutes, as may be necessary.
The author did not find that anything was gained in distinctness by interposing a

lens of short focus between the slit and the wire which supplied the sparks, with

the view of rendering the rays of the electric light parallel like those of the sun,
owing to the absorbent action of the glass weakening the photographic effect ; and
the flickering motion of the sparks being magnified by the lens, rendered the lines

less distinct than when the lens was not used. Although with each of the metals
(including platinum, gold, silver, copper, zinc, aluminmn, magnesium, iron), when
the spark was taken in air, he obtained decided photographs, it appeared that in
each case the impressed spectrum was very nearly the same, proving that few of
--.88 REPORT 1861.

the lines produced were those which were characteristic of the metal. The pecu-

liar lines of the metal seemed chiefly to be confined to the visible portion of the

spectrum, and these had little or no photographic power. This was singularly

exemplified by repeating the experiment upon the same metal in air, in a continu-

ous current o±" pure hydrogen. Iron, for example, gave, in hydrogen, a spectrum in

which a bright orange and a strong green band were visible, besides a few faint

lines in the blue part of the spectnim. Although the light produced by the action

Mlof the coil was allowed to  for ten minutes upon a .sensitive collodion surface,

scarcely a trace of any action was procured ; whilst, in five minutes, in the air, a

powerful impression of numerous bands was obtained. It was remarked by Mr.

mTalbot that, the spectra of coloured flames, the natiu-e of the acid did not influ-

ence the position of the bright lines of the spectrum, which he foimd was dependent

upon the metal employed ; and this remark has been confirmed by all subsequent

--observers. But the case is very different in the absorption-bands produced by

the vapours of coloured bodies, there the nature of both constituents of the com-

poimd is essentially connected with the production of absoi-ptive bands. Chlorine,

combined with hydrogen, gave no bands by absorption in any moderate thickness.

Chlorous acid and peroxide of chlorine both produced the same set of bands, while

hypochlorous acid, although a strongly coloured vapour and containing the same

elements, oxygen and chlorine, produced no absorption-bands. Again, the brown-

ish-red vapour of perchloride of iron produced no absorption-bands ; but when con-

verted into vapour in a flame, the iron showed bands independent of the form in

which it occurred combined. These anomalies appear to admit of .an easy expla-

nation on the supposition that, in any case, the compound employed is decomposed

in the flame, either simply by the high temperature, just as water is, as shown by

Grove, or in other cases by the reducmg action of the burning bodies, which supply

the flame, upon the metallic salt introduced into the flame. In the voltaic pile the

decomposition must of necessity take place by electric action. The compound gases,

Erotoxide and binoxide of nitrogen, give, when electrified, the same series of bright
 ands (as Plucker has sho%\Ti) which their constituents when combined furnish.

Aqueous vapour always gives the bright lines due to hydrogen ; and hydrochloric

acid the mixed system of lines which would be produced by hydrogen and chlorine.

The reducing influence of the hydrogen and other combustible constituents of the

burning body woidd decompose the salt, liberating the metal, which would imme-

diately become oxidized or earned off in the ascending current. There was obvi-

ously a marked difference between the effect of intense ignition upon most of the

metallic and the non-metallic bodies. The observations of Pliicker upon the spectra

of iodine, bromine, and chlorine show that they give, when ignited, a very different

series of bands from those which they furnished by absoi-ption, as Dr. Gladstone has

already pointed out ; but it is interesting to remark that in the case of hydrogen,

which, chemically, is so similar to a metal, we have a comparatively simple spec-

trum, in which the three principal bright lines correspond to Frarmhofer's dark

lines C, F, and G. It was, however, to be specially noted that the hydrogen occa-

sioned no perceptible absoiiition-bands at ordinaiy temperatures in such thickness

as we could command in our experiments, and the vapoiu- of boiling mercury was
also destitute of any absoi-ptive action, although, when ignited by the electric spark,

it gave a characteristic and brilliant series of dark bands. The following experi-

ment suggested itself as a direct test of Kirchhofii''s theory. Two gas-burners, into

which were introduced chloride of sodium on the wick of the spirit-lamp, were

placed so as to illuminate equally the opposite sides of a sheet of paper partially

greased. The rays of the electric light screened from the photometric surface, suit-

ably protected, were made to traverse one of the flames. If the yellow rays of the

light were absorbed by the sodium flame, the light emitted laterally by the flame

shoidd be sensibly increased. The experiment, however, failed to indicate any

such increase in the brilliancy of the flame, possibly because the eye was not suf-

ficiently sensitive to detect the slight difference which was to be expected.

decreasing readings of tlie barometer and when the readings are below the mean, than

with increasing readings and when they are above the mean, and greater when the

range of the barometer and the number of its oscillations are above the mean. It is

greater when the mean daily temperature and dew-point temperature are above the

mean. Ozone is at a minimum with the wind from points north of S.E. and N. W.,

and at a maximum with the wind from points south of these ; it is also at a maximum

when the -svind is above its mean force. AVhen rain is above the mean quantity

ozone is also above the mean, and also vni\\ hail ; but it is below the mean with

snow and sleet. With fog it is below the mean, above it with cirri, halos, am-ora3,

and the zodiacal light, but below it with thunder. It is in greater quantity with

negative than with positive electricity. Ozone periods so frequently commence

vni\\ the wind from S.E. points of the compass, and so often terminate with the

wind in N.W. points, that these may be called their points of commencement and

termination. They may also be said to commence with decreasing readings of the

barometer and increase of temperatm-e, and to terminate with increasing readings

and decrease of temperatm-e. The quantity of ozone is also greater in the nio-ht

than in the day. It is greater with new and full moon than duiing the first and

last quarters ; and it also varies with the seasons, being greater in the winter and

spring months than in summer and autumn. The quantity of ozone varies

with the locality it                                     is greater on the  sea-shore  than at  inland  places,  and  it  also

increases in quantitj^ with increase of elevation. It is gi-eater in the open country

than in towns and villages ; and it is at in drains and cesspools and their vicinity,

and, in short, at every place where the products of putrefaction or combustion are in

sufficient quantity to decompose it. Although these residts are froniHawarden obser-

vations only, they are supported by observations taken at other places. Differences

at individual stations may be attributed to purely local causes. Ozone is a highly

oxidized body, and it is easily decomposed by oxidable substances. If test-paper

prepared with iodide of potassium be exposed in a locality where these substances

are at a miuimmu, it wiU in time become brown, and ozone will be at its maximum.

If a similar paper be placed in a locality where the quantity of oxidable substances

is at its maximum, it will remain white, and ozone will be at a minimum ; and if

a brown paper be put in the latter place, it will lose its colour, sulphuretted hydro-

gen being the decolorizing agent. On the sea and the sea-shore ozone is at its
maximum, because the products of putrefaction are there small in quantity, and

the wind which blows over the ocean is the ozoniferous current. On the land the

products of decomposition are at their maximum, hence the current of air that

passes over it is non-ozoniferous. Indeed aU the conditions of an ozone period are

those of the equatorial or ocean cun-ent of the atmosphere, and the conditions of a

no-ozone period are those of the polar or land current.

  Medico-meteorological results give the maximum of diseases with the ozoniferous
current, and the maximum of deaths with the no-ozone current, but the diseases
may be attributed rather to the vicissitudes of weather than to ozone. As the land

or polar current of the au- is the lower strata in motion, and the ocean or equatorial

current the motion of the higher sti-ata, there ought to be an analogy in a medico-

meteorological sense between them, and so we find that the maximum of deaths takes

place in the lower strata with minimnm of ozone, and the minimum of deaths in

the higher strata with maximum of ozone. The calm is also a no-ozone period.

During continued calms the products of putrefaction accumulate in the lower strata

Aof the atmosphere and produce diseases of an epidemic nature.                                          cholera period

is a calm and a no-ozone period ; and cholera periods tei-minate with the setting

in of the ozoniferous current. In conducting ozone observations, it must be borne
in mind that light causes coloration of the test-papers, and that moisture, sul-

phuretted hydrogen and anmronia cause loss of colour.

On the Solvent Power of Strong and Weak Solutions of the All-aline Carbonates
  on Uric Acid Calculi. By William Roreets, B.A., M.D. Lond., Physician

to the Ma)ichester Royal Infirmary

   The design of the author was to show the Mlacy of certain experiments that
had been made on the solubility of mic acid calculi in solutions of the alkaliae car-
bonates, and to ftu-nish some exact data on which to estimate the rate at which it

is possible to effect dissolution of these calculi by alkaline carbonates.
   About twenty years ago the French Academy appointed a Commission, composed

of MM. Gay-Lussac and Pelouze, to inquire and report on a number of conflicting

commimications that had been made to it by the advocates of solvents for m-inaiy

calcidi and theii' opponents.

 --This Commission reported in 1842 to this effect : They exposed numerous urinary

calculi for a whole year to the contact of solutions of the alkaline carbonates con-

taiuiug from 273 to 546 gi-ains to the pint. None of these were dissolved ; and
gome were not diminished in bulk. Their loss of weight vai-ied from a quai-ter to

one-half.

 _ In another experiment they passed 110 gallons of a sohition containing a twen-

tieth of its weight of carbonate of soda, in the coiu-se of three months, over a mmi-

ber of fi-agments placed at the bottom of a glass ftmnel. The bulk of most of these

was not dhuinished, and their loss of weight varied from 10 to 60 per cent.

They then tried experiments on the liv-ing body, by passing currents of the sol-

vent through the bladder at blood-heat by the double catheter. Here is a sample
Aof their residts.
                    patient who had been subjected to lithotrity, and whose stone

was known to be uric acid, had at different times 55 gallons of a solurion of carbo-

nate of soda containing 132 gi-ains to the pint, passed over a lai-ge remaining fi-agment

which had been carefully measm-ed. This enormous mass of liquid produced no

diminution in the bidk of the fragment ; its only effect was to soften the surface*.
   The conclusions of this report were whoUy adverse to the advocates of solution

--and they were formally adopted by the Academy.
   The experiments, however, have a defect the solutions used were too concen-
trated, and this cu'cumstance vitiates the whole inquiiy. The author found that
very weak solutions of the alkaline carbonates dissolved uric acid calculi with con-
siderable rapidity, whUe stronger ones altogether failed. In order to decide what
strength of solution had most solvent power, fi-agments of m-ic acid, weighing fi-om

40 to 112 grains, were placed in 10-oz, phials, and solutions of carbonate of soda
aiid potash of various strengths were passed over them at blood-heat. The expe-

riments were continued day and night ; and the daily flow of solvent varied fi-om

six to fifteen pints.

  mOperating this way, it was found that above a strength of 120 grains to the

       _

pint there was no dissolution ; and even with 80 gi-ains to the pint there was only

a little ; but solutions of 50 and 60 grains to the pint dissolved the fragments
fi-eely. The cause of this difference was foimd to lie in a coat or ciiist of white

matter which encased the stone in the stronger solutions. At and above 120

gi-aius to the pint, this coat was dense and tough, and could not be wholly detached
from the subjacent stirface. With 89 gr-ains to the pint it was brittle, and easily

detached like a layer of whitewash. With 60 gi-ains to the pint and imder, either
no crust formed at all, and the stone was dissolved clean with a water-worn appeai--
ance, or it was only represented by a few loose flaJies scattered here and there

over the surface, and offering no impediment to dissolution. This coating or crust
was foimd essentially to consist of biurate of potash or soda, and its formation
depended on the fact that the alkaline biitrates ai-e almost insoluble ia any but
very weak solutions of the alkaline carbonates. In the strong solution, the biurate

remains imdissolved and encases the stone in an insoluble investment, whUe in

weaker ones it is dissolved as fiist as it is formed, the surface of the stone remains
clean, and dissolution proceeds without impediment.

acid being left behind, which is purified by distUlation. The acid thus obtained is

in appearance not to be distinouished from oil of vitriol, being a colourless, heavy,

thick, oily, corrosive liquid, giving oif on heating dense white fumes. By heating

the iiqueous perchloric acid with four times its volimie of concentrated sulphuric

acid, the latter takes water from tlie first, dense white fumes are evolved, a yellow

mobile liquid distils over, and afteiTvards thick oily drops appear, which, when

coming in contact with the yellow liquid, form the white crystals, previously obtained

by SeruUas, but in such small quantities that he was miable to analyse the substance,

which prepared in this way always contains sidphuric acid, and is therefore not

fit for analysis and requires redistillation. Heated, however, to 110° C, the cry-

stals decompose and split up again into the yellow liquid, which distils over at a low

temperature, and the thick oily liquid, which remains in the retort. The yellow

liquid thus obtained is pm-e perchloric acid, CI 0, H, a body not known before, which

can be obtained also by distilling one atom of perchlorate of potassium with foiu*

atoms of sulphiu'ic acid. In the pure state it is perfectly colourless, but as com-

monly prepared it is slightly yellow, ovnng to the presence of lower oxides of

chlorine. Perchloric acid is one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known : a

single drop brought into contact with charcoal, paper, wood, alcohol, &c., imme-

diately causes explosive combustion, in violence not falling short of the decomposi-

tion of chloride of nitrogen ; and brought on the skin wounds are produced, which

do not heal for weeks. Like nitric acid it cannot be distilled without decompo-

sition, but it darkens, and ultimately decomposes with explosion. It cannot be kept

for any length of time ; for even when sealed up in glass bidbs which are placed at

the ordinary temperature in the dark, it decomposes suddenly after some time,

breaking the vessel containing it. It mixes with, water with a hissing noise and

evolution of heat, forming the same crj^stals which were mentioned before, and were

used for preparing the piu-e acid. These crystals are the monohydrated perchloric

H+Hjacid, 01 Og  0^. They melt at 50° C, and heated to 110° C. split up in pure

perchloric acid, which distils over, and an oily liquid boiling at 200°, which is

also obtained by boiling aqueous perchloric acid tiU dense white fumes are given oft*.

This oily acid has a constant composition, containing 72'3 per cent, of pure per-

chloric acid and 27'7 per cent, of water. This per-centage corresponds, however,

to no definite hydrate of simple atomic composition ; and therefore this acid fol-

lows the same general relations respecting composition and boUing-point which,

as I have shown previously, hold good for so many other aqueous acids, namely,

that the phenomenon of constant boiling-point and constant composition depends

chiefly upon physical and not upon chemical attractions.

   On Vesicular Structure in Copper. By Drs. Eussell and Mattbxesseh-.

   The authors proved by numerous experiments that the vesicular structm-o is
caused by the action of carbon or sulphur on the suboxide dissolved in melted

copper.

On certain Difficulties in tJie ivay of separating Gold from Quartz.
                        By Dr. Smith of Sydney.

In Australia the usual plan is to reduce the quartz to powder by Cornish stampers,

a stream of water being allowed to flow through the stamp box dm-ing the opera-

tion. The pounded quartz is carried by the stream through fine gratings, and then

along an inclined plane supplied with various contrivances, such as blanket stuff

and plates of copper rubbed over with morciu-y, for detaining the gold. The stream

is next conducted into the basin of a Chilian mill, where the "pulp " is ground up

with mercury. These operations are for the most part so successful as to leave not

more than half an ounce of gold in a ton of " tailings." But this successful result

Whenis only attained when the quartz is free from pyrites.  pjTites is present,

particularly a black amorphous variety (found by Dr. Leibius to contain disulphido

of copper and sesquisulphide of iron), there is a notable loss both of gold and

mercury in the process of amalgamation. In the basin of the Chilian mill a greyish-

black scum might then be seen, which contains mercury and gold in fine di^-ision,

together with various components of the pyritous quartz, buoyed up by the en-

tanglement of air. The action upon the mercury appeared to be chiefly mechanical,

but also in some degree chemical, a small portion of sulphide of mercury being

found in the scum, whUe the gold extracted contained a much larger proportion

of copper than is usual mth Australian gold. The Australian miners appeared to

have hit on no economical mode of separating the gold from pyritous quartz, so as

to avoid this loss.

          On the Cohesio7i-Fi(jures of Liquids. By Charles Tomlinson.

   Eegarding solution as a case of adhesion, the author showed that when a drop of

an independent liquid («. e. not a solution) is placed on the surface of another in-
dependent liquid, such as water, a struggle takes place between them. The par-
ticles of the drop endeavour to maiutain their cohesion, the adhesion of the surface
tends to overcome it; hence a well-defined figure, named by the author a cohesion-
Jigure, and regarded as the resultant of the cohesion of the liquid, its density, and
the adhesion of the surface. For example, if a drop of oil of lavender be gently

delivered to the surface of water in a chemically clean glass, about 3^ inches in
diameter, it is spread out by the adhesion of the surface into a weU-defined film
cohesion then endeavours to reassert itself, and a struggle takes place between the
two forces, the result being a beautiful complicated pattern resembling Carrigeen

moss. The cohesion-figures of other oils, fixed and volatile, of creosote, ether,
alcohol, naphtha, &c. were shown experimentally, or in the form of large diagrams.
In order to produce these figm'es, the glass vessels and the water must be chemically
clean. The figures present a variety of novel and beautiful effects, both as to form
and colour, and are likely to prove highly suggestive to the pattern-designer.
Moreover, the forms being tyjDical of the substances, a ready means is thus afforded

of detecting adidteration.

On the Composition and Properties of the Water of Loch Katrine, as supplied

                             in Glasgow. Bi/Dt.W&lJjAC^, F.C.S.

   The water of Loch Katiine is well known to he remarkably pure, and to have
the property of acting upon lead more extensively than any other natural water
known, if we except rain-water. This latter circumstance induced several of our
most eminent chemists to express the opinion that danger to the health of the
people of Glasgow might arise from the introduction of the water.

   The distance of the lake from the city is about 35 miles, and the author shows
that the water becomes altered very considerably in composition during its ti'ansit.

A minute and carefid analysis of the water was made in February last ; and for

comparison an analysis of the true Loch Kati-ine water, made in the spring of
1854, is also given, the numbers representing grains per gallon-

   In the Loch Katrine water no carbonate of lime was found, while a direct deter-
mination of this compoimd in the Glasgow water gave -68 grain per gallon. This
carbonate of lime is supposed to be derived from sandstone and other rocks through

wliich the water flows.
   Jjoch Katrine water gave 7-5, and Glasgow water 8-5 cubic inches of gas per

gallon, which contained in 100 parts

   The difference in. the total quantity of gases may be owing to variation of tem-
perature. The increase in the carbonic acid, accompanied by a corresponding

decrease in the oxygen, appears to be owing to the oxidation of organic matter, a

similar change occurring wnen the Loch Katrine water is kept in a closed vessel
for a week or two.

   Experiments on the action of the Glasgow water on lead show it to be much less
active in this respect than the original water of Loch Katrine, the quantity dissolved

during the first twenty-four hoiirs being about one-thu-d, and the idtimate result
after several weeks, the water being renewed every twenty-four hours, rather more
than half of the quantity dissolved by the original water under similar circumstances.

At the end of a month the proportion of lead dissolved by the Glasgow water

appears to remain steady at -jLth of a grain of lead per gallon, a quantity that is

just upon the verge of danger.

   Ou the large scale, vdth pipes and cisterns in actual use, the proportions of lead
dissolved were smaller. Tliree sets of experiments were made ; with an old f -inch
pipe previously, employed for two yeai-s for the conveyance of Clyde water, a new
^-inch pipe; and a new cistern exposing 2i square feet of surface to each cubic foot
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                 95

of water. Observations -were commenced after tlie new pipe and cistern had been

in use for several weeks, and were continued for about a month, the water being;
changed eveiy twenty-four hours. The average quantity of lead dissolved in
twenty-four hours was

                    ^In the old pipe grain per gallon.

                  ^In the new pipe grain per gallon.

                                     In the cistern -^^ grain per gallon.

   The greater amount dissolved in the new pipe than in the cistern depends upon

the larger extent of surface exposed, in the one case 31, in the other only Sg square
feet to each cubic foot of water.

   The quantities of lead dissolved, although consideriibly below the proportions
considered actually dangerous, are, nevertheless, somewhat alamiing ; but it must
be borne in mind that the water seldom remains in the pipes more than ten hours,
and that during the night when the temperature is lowest ; and that in Glasgow

the water is usually supplied direct fi'om the street mains, without passing through

cisterns.

   The results obtained by Dr. Wallace may be reduced to the following simimaiy :--

1st, the water-supply of Glasgow is very sensibly harder, and acts with considerably
less energy on lead than the water of Loch Katiine ; and 2nd, the amount of lead
taken up from pipes and cisterns at the present time is not such as to give rise to

serious apprehensions.

On an Apparatus for the rapid Separation and Measurement of Oases.
                     By Drs. Williamson and Russell.

GEOLOGY.

Address ly Sir Roderick Impet MuRcmsoN, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., Direc-

   tor- General of the Geoloyical Survey of the United Kingdom, President of the

    Section.

Although I have had the honour of presiding over the geologists of the British

Association at several previous Meetings since our first gathering at York, now

thirty years ago, I have never been called upon to open the business of this Section

with an address; this custom having been introduced since I last occupied the

geological chair at Glasgow, in 1865.

The addresses of my immediate predecessors, and the last anniversary discourse

of the President of the Geological Society of London, have embraced so much of

the recent progress of our science in many branthes, that it would be superfluous

on my part to go over many topics again which have been already well treated.

Thus, it is needless that I should occupy your time by alluding to the engi'ossino-

subject of the most recent natural operations with which the geologist has to deal and

which connect his labours with those of the ethnologist. On this head I will oulv

say that, having carefully examined the detrital accumulations formino- the ancient

banks of the river Somme in France, I am as complete a believer in the commix-

ture in that ancient alluviimi of the works of man with the reliquise of extinct ani-
mals, as their meritorious discoverer, M. Boucher de Perthes, or as their expounders

myPrestwich, Lyell, and others. I may, however, express  gratification in learn-

ing that our own countiy is now affording proofs of similar intermixture both in

Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, and other counties ; and, possibly, at this Meetino- we
may have to record additional evidences on this highly interesting topic.
                                                                           "

But I pass at once from any consideration of these recent accunudations, and,

indeed, of all tertiary rocks

                                my;
and, as a brief space of time only is at                                   disposal I

will now merely lay before you a concise retrospect of the progress wliich has latterly
been made in the development of one great branch of oui- science. I confine myself

then to the consideration of those primeval rocks with which my own reseitrches

have for many years been most connected, with a few allusioua only to metamor-

phism, and certain metalliferous productions^ &c.
--96 REPORT 1861.

   There is, indeed, a peculiai- fitness in now dwelling more especially on the ancient

rocks, inasmuch as Manchester is surrounded by some of them, whilst, with the
exception of certain gi'oups of erratic blocks and drifts, no deposits occur wathin the
reach of short excursions from hence, which are either of secondary or tertiary age.

   Let us, then, take a retrospective view of the progress which has been made in
the classification and delineation of the older rocks since the Association first as-
sembled at York in 1831. At that time, as every old geologist knows, no attempt
had been made to imravel the order or characters of the formations which rise from
beneath the Old Hed Sandstone. In that year Sedgwick was only beginning to
make his first inroads into those mountains of North Wales, the inti-icacies of which

he finally so well elaborated, whilst I only brought to that, our earliest assembly,
the first fruits of observations in Herefordf-iiire, Brecon, Radnor, and Slu'opshire,

which led me to work out an order which has since been generally adopted.
   At that time the terms ' Cambrian,' ' Silurian,' ' Devonian,' and 'Permian,' were

not dreamt of; but, acting on the true Baconian principle, their founders and their
coadjutors have, after years of toil and comparison, set up such plain landmarks on

geological horizons that they have been recognized over many a distant land. Com-
pare the best map of England of the year 1831, or that of Greenough, which had
advanced somewhat upon the admirable original classification of our father, Wil-

liam Smith, and see the striking difference between the then existing knowledge

and our present acquirements. It is not too much to say that when the Britisli
Association first met, all the region on both sides of the Welsh border, and extend-
ing to the Irish Channel on the west, was in a state of dire confusion ; whilst in
Devonshire and Cornwall many of these rocks, which from their crystalline nature
were classed and mapped as among the most ancient in the kingdom, have since
been sho-mi to be of no higher antiquity than the Old Eed Sandstone of Here-

fordshire.

   As to Scotland, where the ancient rocks abound, though their mineral structure,
particularly in those of igneous origin, had necessarily been much developed in the
country of lluttou, Playfair, Hall, Jameson, and McCuUoch, yet the true age of most

of its sedimentary rocks and their relations were unlmown. Still less had Ireland,
another region mainly palajozoic, received any striking portion of that illustration

which has since appeared in the excellent general map of Grifiith, and which is now

being carried to perfection through the labom-s of the Geological Survey under my

colleague Jukes. If such was our benighted state as regarded the order and cha-

racters of the older formations at our first Meeting, gi-eat was the advance we had
made when at our twelfth Meeting we first assembled at Manchester in 1842.
Presiding then as I do now over the Geological Section, I showed in an evening
lecture how the palaeozoic rocks of Silm-ian, Devonian, and Carboniferous age, as
well as those rocks to which I had assigned the name of Pemiian, were spread over
the vast region of Russia in Europe and the Ural Mountains. What, then, are
some of the main additions which have been made to our acquaintance with the
older rocks in the British Isles since we last visited Manchester ?

   Commencing with the oldest strata, I may now assume, from the examination of

several associates on whose powers of observation as well as my own I rely, that

what I asserted at the Aberdeen Meeting in 1859, as the result of several surveys,
and what 1 first put forth at the Glasgow Meeting of 1855, is substantially true.
The stratified gneiss of the north-west coast of the Highlands, and of the large
island of Lewis and the outer Hebrides, is the fundamental rock of the British Isles,
and the precise equivalent of the Laiurentian system of Canada, as described by Sir

W. Logan. The establishment of this order, which is so clearly exhibited in great

natural sections on the west coast of Sutherland and Ross, is of great importance in

giving to the science we cultivate a lower datum-line than we pre\'iously possessed,

as first propoimded by myself before the British Association in 1855 *.

   * See Eoport of British Association for 185.5 (Glasgow Meeting). At that time I was
not aware tliat the same order was developed on a grand scale in Canada, nor do I now

know when that order was there first observed by Sir W. Logan. I then (1855) simply put

forward the facts as esliibited on the north-west coast of Scotland ; viz. the existence of what
I termed a lower or " fundamental gneiss," lying far beneath other gneissose and crystal-
line strata, contaiaing remains which I even then suggested were of Lower Silurian age.
Subsequently, in 1859, when accompanied by Professor Kamsay, I adopted, at his eugges-
       TRANSACTIONg OP THE SECTIONS.                                         9/

   For hitherto the order of the geological succession, even as seen in the Geologi-

cal Map of England and Wales or Ireland, as approved by Sir Henry De la Beche

and his able coadjutors, Phillips, Ramsay, Jukes, and others, admits no older sedi-
ment than the Cambrian of North Wales, whether in its slaty condition in Merio-
neth and Caernarvon, or in its more altered condition in Anglesea.

   The researches in the Highlands have, however, shown that in our own islands,

the older palaeozoic rocks, properly so called, or those in which the first traces of life

have been discovered, do repose, as in the broad regions of the Laurentian Moun-
tains of Canada, upon a gi-and stratified crystalline foimdation, in which both lime-

stones and iron-ores occur subordinate to gneiss. In Scotland, therefore, these

earliest gneissic accumulations are now to be marked on oiu* maps by the Greek
letter alpha, as preceding the Roman a, which had been previously applied to the
lowest known deposits of England, Wales, and Ireland. Though we must not dog-

matise and afiirm that these fimdamental deposits were in their pristine state abso-
lutely unfurnished vnth. any living things (for Logan and Sterry Hunt, in Canada,

have suggested that there they indicate traces of the fonner life), we may conclude,
that in the highly metamorphosed condition in which they are now presented to us
in North-western Britain, and associated as they are with much granitic and hom-

blendic matter, they are, for all pm-poses of the practical geologist, " azoic rocks."

The Cambrian rocks, or second stage in the ascending order as seen reposing on the

fundamental gneiss of the north-west of Scotland, are purple and red sandstones
and conglomerates forming lofty moimtains. These resemble to a great extent

portions of the rocks of the same age which are so well known in the Longmynd
range of Shropshire, and at Harlech in North Wales, and Bray Head in Ireland.

   At Bray Head they have afforded the Oldhmnia, possibly an Alga, whilst at the
Longmynd, in Shropshire, they have yielded to the researches of Mr. Salter some

worm-tracks, and the trace of an obscure crustacean.
   The Highland rocks of this age, as well as their equivalents, the Huronian rocks

of North America, have as yet afforded no trace whatever of former life. And yet

such Cambrian rocks are in parts of the Longmynd, and specially in the lofty moun-
tains of the north-western Highlands, much less metamorphosed than many of the
crystalline rocks which lie upon them. Rising in the scale of successive deposits,
we find a corresponding rise in the signs of former life on reaching that stage in
the earlier slaty and schistose rocks in which animal remains begin clearly to show
themselves. Thus, the Primordial Zone of M. Barrande is, according to that eminent

man, the oldest fauna of the Silurian Basin in Bohemia*.

   In the classification adopted by Sir Henry De la Beche and his associates, the

Lingida Flags (the equivalent of the Zone Primordiale of Barrande) are similarly

placed at the base of the Sihuian system. This Primordial Zone is also classed as the

Lowest Silurian by De Vemeuil, in Spain ; by James Hall, Dale Owen and others, in
the United States; and by SirW. Logan, Sterry Hunt, and Billings, in Canada f.

   In the last year, M. Barrande has most ably compared the North Ajnerican Taco-

tion, the word ' Laurentian,' in compliment to my friend Sir WiUiam Logan, who had

then worked out the order in Canada, and mapped it on a stupendous scale. I stated,

however, at the same time, that if a British synonym was to have been taken, I should

have proposed the word ' Lewisian,' from the large island of the Lewis, almost wholly

composed of this gneiss.

* I learn, however, that in Bohemia Dr. Fritsch has recently discovered stratalying beneath

the mass of the Primordial Zone of Barrande, and in rocks hitherto considered azoic the

fossil burrows of annelide animals similar to those of our own Longmynd.

t In completing at his own cost a geological survey of Spain, in which he has been occu-

pied for several years, and in the carrying out of which he has determined the width of the

sedimentary rocks of the Peninsula (including the Primordial SUurian Zone, discovered by

that zealous explorer, M. Casiano de Prado), M. de Vemeuil has in the last few months

chiefly examined the eastern part of the kingdom where few of the older palaeozoic rocks

exist. I am, however, informed by him, that Upper Silurian rocks with Cardiola interrupta,

identical with those of France and Bohemia, occur along the southern flanks of the Pyre-

nees, and also re-occur in the Sierra Morena, in strata that overhe the great mass of Lower

Silurian rocks as formerly described by M. Casiano de Prado and himself. The southern

face of the Pyrenees, he further informs me, is specially marked by the display of miu-al

masses of Carboniferous strata, which, succeeding the Devonian rocks, are not arranged in

basin-shape, but stand out in vertical or highly inclined positions, and are followed by

nic group of Emmons * with his own primordial Silurian fauna of Bohemia and

other parts of Eui'ope ; and although that soimd palajontologist, Mr. James Hall,
has not hitherto quite coincided with M. Barrande in some details f, it is evident

tliat the primordial fauna occurs in many parts of North America. And as the true
order of succession has been ascertained, we now know that the Taconic group is

of the same age as the lower Wisconsin beds described by Dale Owen, with their

ParadoxideSf Dikelocephalus, &c., as well as of the lower portion of the Quebec rocks,
with their Cmiocephalm, Axionellm, &c., described by Logan and Bmings. Of the

ciystalline schists of Massachusetts, containing the noble specimen of Paradoxides

described by W. Eogers, and of the Vermont beds, with their OUni, it follows that

the Primordial Silurian Zone of Barrande (the lower Lingula-flags of Britain) is

largely represented in North America, however it may occupy an inverted position

ill some cases, and in others be altered into ciystalline rocks.

In determining this question due regard has been had to the great convulsions,

inversions, and breaks to which these ancient rocks of North Ajoierica have been

subjected, as described by Professors Heniy and W. Rogers.

  In an ablo review of this subject, Mr. Stei-ry Hunt thus expresses himself:

We'^ regard the whole Quebec group, with its imderlyiug primordial shales, as the

gl-eatly developed representatives of the Potsdam and Calcilerous gi-oups (with part

of that of Chazy), and the true base of the SUui-ian system       The Quebec gi'oup,

with its imderlying shales," this author adds (and he expresses the opinion of Sir

W. Logan), " is no other than the Taconic system of Emmons ;" whicn is thus, by

these authors, as well as Mr. James Hall, shown to be the natm'al base of the Silu-

rian rocks in America, aa Barrande and De Vemeuil have proved it to be on the con-

tinent of Europe.

  In GUI' own coimtiy a valuable enlargement of oui' acquaintance with the relations
of the piTmordial zone to the overling members of the Silurian rocks has been

made through the personal examination of Mr. Salter, aided by the independent

discoveries of organic remains by MM. Ilom&ay and Ashe, of Tremadoc.

   It has thus been ascertained that the lower member only of the deposit, which has

been hitherto merged imder the name of Lingida-llags, can be considered tho equi-
valent of the primordial zone of Bohemia. In North Wales that zone lias hitherto
been mainly characterized by Lingida and the crustaceous Olenus and Paradoxides.

Certain additions having been made to these fossils, Mr. Salter finds that of the
whole there are five genera peculiar to the lower zone, and seven which pass up-
wards from it into the next overlying band or the Tremadoc slate. But the over-
lying Tremadoc slate, hitherto also gi-ouped -svith the Lingula-flags, is, through its

numerous fossils (many of them of recent discovery), demonstrated to constitute a
true lower member of the Llandeilo formation. For, among the trilobites, the well-

known Llaudeilo forms of Asaphtts and 0(/ygia range upwards from the veiy base
of these slates. Again, seven or eight other genera of trilobites, which appear

here for the first time, are associated with genera of mollusks and encnnites

which have lived through the whole Sihu'ian series. Such, for example, are the
genera Calymene, lUcenus, among crustaceans; the Lingula, Orthis, Belkrojihon,

and Comdaria among mollusks, together with encrinites, corals, and that telling
Silurian zoophyte, the Graptolite. By this proof of the community of fossil tj^es,

as well as by a clear lithological passage of the beds, these Tremadoc slates are thus

shown to be iudissolubly connected with the Llandeilo and other Silurian forma-
tions above them ; whilst, although tliey also pass down confonnably into the zone

primordiale, tho latter is characterized by the lingidoid shells (Ltuf/tdella, Salter)

and by tho genera Olemis, Paradoxides, and Dikelocephalus, which most charac-

terize it in Britain as in other regions J,

extensive conglomerates and marls of triassie age, and these by deposits charged with fos-

sils of the Lias.

   * Tlie Sihu'ian classification was proposed by me in 1835, and in the following year (183G)
Dr. Emmons suggested that his black shale rocks, which he called Taconic, were older than

any I described.

  t Nor arc the writings of the Professors W. B. and S. D. Eogers in unison with tho

opinions of the authors here cited.

   X In the last edition of ' Sihu-ia ' the distinction was drawn between the lower and upper
Liugida-flags, but the faima of the latter is now much enlarged.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE 8KCTI0NS,  98L

   I take this opportunity, however, of reiterating the opinion I have expressed in

my work ' Siluiia,' that to whatever extent the primordial zone of Barrande be

distinguished by peculiar fossils in any given tract from the prevalent Lower Silu-
rian types, there exists no valid groimd. for difiering from BaiTande, De Vemeuil,
Logan, James Hall, and others, by separating this rudimentary fauna from that of
the gi-eat Silmian series of life of which stratigi'aphically it constitutes the conform-
able base. i\iid if in Europe but few genera be yet found which are common
to this lower zone and the Llandeilo foiiuation (though the Aynostus and Orthis
are common to it and aU the Silurian sti-ata), we msty not imreasonably attribute
the circmiistance to the fact that the primordial zone of no one coxmtry contains

more than a veiy limited number of distinct forms. May we not, therefore, infer
that in the sequel other fossil links, similar to those which are now known to con-

--nect the Lower and Upper Silmian series ^which I myself at one time supposed to
--be shari^ly separated by their organic remains wiU be brought to light, and will

then zoologically connect the primordial zone with the overlying strata into which
it gi-aduates ? Let us recoUect that a few years only have elapsed since M. de
Vemeuil was criticised for inserting, in his Table of the Palaeozoic Fauna of North
America, a number of species as being common to the Lower and Upper Silurian.

But now the view of the eminent French Academician has been completely sus-

tained by the discovery in the strata of Anticosti, as worked out by Mr. Billings

under the direction of Six W. Logan, of a group of fossils intermediate in character

between those of the Hudson River and Clinton formations, or, in other words, be-
tween Lower and Upper Silurian rocks. In like manner, a similar interlacing seems
already to have been found in North America between the Quebec group, with its
primordial fossils, and the Trenton deposits, which are, as is well known, of the

Llandeilo age.

   I have tlius spoken out upon the fitness of adhering to the classifications decided

upon by Sir Henry De la Beche and his associates long before I had any relation to
the Geological Survey, and which places the whole of the Lingula-flags of Wales
as the natural base of the Silm-ian rocks. For English geologists should remember

that this arrangement is not merely the issue of the view I have long maintained,

but is also the matured opinion of those geologists in foreign coimtries and in our

colonies who have not only zealously elaborated the necessaiy details, but who

have also had the opportunities of making the widest comparisons.

   On the continent of Europe an interesting addition has been made to oui" ac-
quaintance with the fauna of one of the older beds of the Lower Silurian rocks,

or the Obolus greensand of St. Petersburg*, by our eminent associate, Ehrenberg,

He has described and liguredf four genera and ten species of microscopic Ptero-
podfl, one of which he names Panderella Silurica ; the generic name being in honour
of the distinguished Kussian palaeontologist. Pander, who collected them. It is
well to remark, that as the very grains of this Lower Silurian greensand seem to
be in great part made up of these minute organisms, so we recognize, in one of the

oldest strata in which animal life has been detected^ organisms of the same nature,
and not less abimdant than those which constitute the deep sea-bottoms of the

existing Mediterranean and other seas.
   Before I quit the consideration of the older palseozoic rocks, I must remind you

that it is through the discoA^ery, by Mr. C. Peach, of certain fossils of Lower Silu-
rian age in the limestones of Sutherland, combined with the order of the strata,
observed in the year 1827 by Professor Sedgwick and myself, that the ti-ue age of

the largest and overlying masses of the crystalline rocks of the Highlands has been
fixed. The fossils of the Sutherland limestone are not indeed stiictly those of the
Lower Silurian of England and Wales, but are analogous to those of the calcife-

rous sand-rock of North America. The 3Iaclurea is indeed known in the Silurian
lunestone of the south of Scotland ; but the OjjMleta and other forms are not found
until we reach the horizon of North America. Now, these fossils refer the zone of
the Highland limestone and associated quartz-rocks to that portion of the Lower
Silmian which fonns the natural base of the Trenton series of North America, or
the lower part of the Llandeilo foimation of Britain, The intermediate formation

-- --^the Lingula "flags' oi- "zone priniordiale " of Eolioniia ^having no representa-

tive in the nortli-western Highlands, there is necessarily a complete unconformity

between the fossil-bearing crystalline limestones and quartz-rocks with the Maclurea,

Murchisonia, Ophilcta, Orthis, Orthoccratites, &c., and those Cambrian rocks on

which they rest.

  A great revolution in the ideas of many an old geologist, including myself, has

thus been effected. Strengthened and confirmed as my view has been by the con-

cordant testimony of Ramsay, Harkness, Geikie, James, and others, I have had no

hesitation ia considering a very large portion of the crystalline strata of the High-

lands to be of the same age as some of the older fossiliferous Silurian rocks, whether

in the form of slates in Wales, of greywacke-schist in the southern counties of

Scotland, or iu the conditions of mud and sand at St. Petersburg. The conclu-

sion as respects the correlation of all the older rocks of Scotland has now indeed
been summed up by Mr. Geikie and myself in the ' Geological Sketch-Map of
Scotland,' which we have just published, and a copy of which is now exhibited*.

Not the least interesting part of that production is that which explains the age

of all the igneous or trappean rocks of the south of Scotland, as well as all the

divisions of the Carboniferous formation, and is exclusively the work of my able

colleague.

But if, through the labours of hard-working geologists, we have anived at a clear

idea of the first recognizable traces of life and their sequences, we are yet far from

having satisfied our iniuds as to the modus operandi by which whole regions of such

deposits have, as in the Highlands, been transmuted into a crystalline slate. Let

us therefore hope that, ere this Meeting closes, we may receive instruction from

some one of the baud of foreign or British geologists who have by their experi-

mental researches been endeavouring to explain the processes by which such won-

derful changes in the former condition of sedimentary deposits have beeu brought

to light ; such as that by which strata once resembling the incoherent Silurian clay

·which we see iu Russia have been hardened into such rocks as the slaty grauwacke
of other regions, and how hard schists of the south of Scotland have been meta-
morphosed into the crystalline rocks of the Highlands. But why are British geo-

logists to see any difficulty in admitting what 1 have proposed, that vast breadths

of these crystalline stratified rocks of the Highlands are of Lower Silmian age ?
Many years ago I suggested, after examination, that some of the ciystalline rocks
near Christiania in Norway were but altered extensions of the Silmian deposits of

that region ; and, since then, Mr. David Forbes and M. Kjerulf have demonstrated the

truth of the suggestion. Again, and on a vastly larger scale, we know that in North
America all the noted geologists, however they may differ on certain details, agi'ee

in recognizing the fact that the vast eastern seaboard range of gneissic and micaceous
schists is made up of metamorohosed strata, superior even to the lowest of the

Silmian rocks. Logan, Rogers, Hall, and Steii'y Hunt are decidedly of this opinion

and the point has been most ably and clearly set before the public by the last-men-

tioned of these geologists f, who, being himself an accomplished chemist, has given
us some good illusti'ations of the probable modus operandi in the bringing about

of these changes.

   The importance of the inquiries to be made by chemical geologists into this
branch of our science was not lost upon the earlier members of the British Asso-

ciation. Even in the year 1833, a committee was appointed to endeavour to illus-

trate the phenomena of the metamorphism of rocks hy experiments carried on in

W.iron-fm-naces. After a series of trials on various mineral substances, the Rev.
Vemon Harcourt, to whom we owed so much at our foundation, has, as the reporter

of that committee, been enabled to present to the Association that lucid Report on

the actual effect of long-continued heat which is published in oiu- last volume. In

referring you to that document, I must, as an old practical field-geologist, express the

mygratification I feel in seeing that  eminent friend has, in the spirit of true induc-

tive philosophy, arrived, after much experiment and thought, at the same conclusion

at which, in common with Sedgwick, Buckland, De la Beche, Phillips, and others

in my own coimti-y; and with L. von Buch, Elie de Beaumont, and a host of geolo-

gists abroad, I had long ago aiTivcd in the field. I, therefore, re-echo their voices

in repeating the words of Mr. W. Harcourt, " that we are not entitled to presume

that the forces which have operated on the earth's cnist have always been the same."
Looking to the only rational theory which has ever been propounded to accoimt for

--the great changes in the crust which have taken pLace in former periods the exist-

ence of an intense central heat which has been secularly more and more repressed
by the accumulation of sediment imtil the sm-face of the planet was brought^ into

--its present comparatively quiescent condition our first General Secretary has indi-

cated the train of causes, chemical and physical, which resolve some of the difii-

culties of the problem. He has brought before us, ia a compendious digest, the

history of the progress which has been made in this branch of our science, by the
vnitings of La Place, Fourier, Von Buch, Foumet, and others, as well as by the

experimental researches of Mitscherlich, Berthier, Senarmont, Daubree, DeviUe,

Delesse, and Durocher. Illustratiug his views by reference to chemical changes in

the rocks and minerals of our own covmtry, and foi-tifying his induction by an appeal

to his experiments, he arrives at the conclusion, that there existed in foiiner periods

a much greater intensity of causation than that which now prevails. His theory

is, that whereas now, in the formation of beds, the aqueous action predominates,
and the igneous is only represented by a few solfataras, in the most ancient times

the action was much more igneous, and that in the intermediate times fire and

water divided the empire between them. In a word, he concludes with the ex-

pression of the opinion, which my long-continued observation of facts had led me

to adopt, " that the nature, force, and progi-ess of tjje past condition of the earth

cannot be meastired by its existing condition."

   Li addition to these observations on metamorphism, let me remind you that, on

the recommendation of the British Association, other important researches have

been earned on by Mr. William Hopldns) our new General Secretary, and in the

furnaces of our President, Mr. Fairbaim, on the conductive powers for heat in
various mineral substances. Although these experiments have been retarded by a
serious accident which befell Mr. Hopkins, they are still in progress, and I learn

from him that, without entering into any general discussion as to the probable
thickness of the crust of oiu* planet, we may even now afiinn, on experimental

evidence, that, assuming the observed terrestrial temperature to be due to central
heat, the thickness of this crust must be two or three times as great as that which

has been usually considered to be indicated by the observed increase of temperatm-e

at accessible depths beneath the earth's surface.

   Of the Devonian rocks or Old Bed Sandstone much might be said, if I were to

advert to the details which have been recently worked out in Scotland by Page,
Anderson, Mitchell, Powrie, and others ,· and in England, by the researches of the

Eev. W. Symonds, and other members of the Woolhope and Malvern Clubs. But
confining myself to general observations, it may be stated that a triple subdivision

of that group, which I have shown to hold good over the Continent of Europe as
in our own comitry, seems now to be generally admitted, whilst the history of its
southern fauna in Devonshire has recently been graphically and ably elaborated by

 Mr. Pengelly, in a paper printed in om- last volume.
    Li Herefordshire and Shropshire the passage of the upper members of the Silu-

rian rocks into the inferior strata of the Old Bed group has been well shown by

 Mr. Lightbody, and the fossils of its lower members have been vigorously collected

whUst in Scotland Mr. Geikie and others have shown the upward passage of its
 superiof strata into the base of the Carboniferous rocks; and Dr. Anderson an-

 nounces the finding of shells with Crustacea in the lower or grey beds south of the

Tay. I may here note, that the point which I have been for some j'ears endea-
 vouring to establish as to the true position of the Caithness flags with their nume-

rous ichthyolites seems to be admitted by my contemporaries. The lamented Hugh

 Miller considered these ichthyolites as belonging to the lower member of the group,

 and had good gTounds for his views, since at his native place, Cromarty, these fish-
 beds appear very near the base. But, by following them into Caithness and the

 Orkneys, I have shown that they occupy a middle position, whilst the true base of
 the group is the equivalent of the zone with Ceplialaspis, Pteraspis, and Ptet-y-

 gottcs.

    And here it is right to state that the Upper Silurian rocks, which are clearly re-
                                                                              ;;

presented iu Edinliui-ghsliire, and wliicli in Lanarkshire seem to graduate upwards

into the Lower Old Red or Cephalaspis sandstone, are wanting in the Highlands

 thus accounting for the great break which there occurs between the crj-staUized

rocks of Lower Silurian age and the bottom beds of the Old Red Sandstone.
    Of the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland and Herefordshire I may be permitted

 further to observe, that its downward passage into the uppermost SUiuian rock,

--and the upward passage of its higher strata into the Carboniferous strata, have been

 well developed, the one near Ludlow, chiefly through the labours of Mi'. Light-
, body ; the other in Scotland, through the researches of the Government Geologists,

Howell and Geikie, as well as by those of AL-. D. Page and other observers. On
this head I may, however, note, what my contemporaries seem now to admit, that

 the removal of the Caithness flags and their numerous included ichthyolites from

 the bottom of this group, and their translation to the central pai't of the system, as

 first proposed by myself, is correct. Li ti'uth, the lower member of this system is

 now imequivocaUy proved to be the band with Cephalaspis, Pteraspis, &c., as seen
 in Scotland, England, and Russia. The gi-eat break which has been traced in the
 south of Scotland by Mr. Geikie between the lower and upper Old Red is thus in

--perfect harmony with the zoological fact that the central or Caithness faima is

 entirely wanting in that region, as in England as it ia indeed in Ireland, where a

similar break occurs.

   It gratifies me to add, that many new forms of those fossil fishes which so pecu-
liarly characterize the Old Red Sandstone, have been a<lmirably described by Sir

Philip de Grey Egerton in the 'Memoirs of the Geological _Sur\-ey;' and I must

remark that it is most fortuf5ate that the eminent Agassiz is here so well repre-

sented by my distinguished friend, who stands imquestionably at the head of the

fossil ichthyologists of our coimtry.

 -- --Very considerable advances have been made in the development of our acquaint-

ance'with that system the Carboniferous which in the North of England (York-
shire) has been so well described by Professor PhiUips, and with which all practi-
cal geologists in and around Manchester are necossamy most interested. The close

researches of Mr. Binney, who has from time to time thrown new light on the

origin and relations of coal and the component parts of its matrix, established
proofs, so long ago as 1840, that great part of oiu- coal-fields was acciimulated under
marine conditions ; the fossils associated with the coal-beds being, not, as had been
too generally supposed, of fluviatHe or lacustrine character, but the spoils of marine
life. Professor Henry Rogers came to the same conclusion with regard to the

Appalachian coal-fields in America in 1842. Mr. Binney believes that the plant

SigiUaria grew in salt water ; and it is to bo remarked that even in tho so-caUed

"freshwater limestones" of Ardwick and Lc Botwood, the SpirorUs and other

marine shells are frequent, whilst many of the shells tenned Ci/pris may prove to

be species of Cythcre. Again, iu the illustrations of the fossils which occiu- in the

bands of iron-ore in the South Welsh coal-field, Mr. Salter, enteiing particidarly

into this question, has shown that in the so-called "Unio-beds" there constantly

occurs  a  shell  related  to  the  Mya  of  our  coa.sts,  which  he  temis  Anthracomya
                                                                                                                                     ;

whilst, as he has stated in the ' Memoh's of the Geological Siurvey,' just issued, the

very Unios of these beds have a peculiar aspect, diflering much from that of true

fres'hwater forms. They have, he says, a strongly wiinkled epidermis, which is a

mark of the Myadse, or such burrowing bivalve shells, and not of true Unionidse

they also differ in the interior, as shown by Professor W. King. Seeing that in

these cases quietly deposited limestones with marine shells (some of them indeed
of estuary character) rest upon beds of coal, and that in many other cases purely

mai-ine limestones alternate frequently with layers of vegetable matter and coal,

may we not be led to modify the theoiy, founded on the sound observation of Sir

W. Logan, by which the fonnation of coal has been rather too exclusively refen-ed
to teiTestrial and freshwater conditions ? May we not rather revert to that more

expansive docti-ine, which I have long supported, that different operations of nature

have brought about the consolidation and alteration of vegetable matter into coal ?

In other words, that in one tract the coal has been formed by the subsidence in situ
of vast breadths of foi-mer jimgles and forests ; in another, by the transport of
vegetable materials into marine estuaries ; in a third case, as in Russia and Scot-

land (where purely marine limestones alternate with coal), by a succession of oacil-

   The              Map

recently published, with its lucid explanations, affords indeed the clearest proofe

of the frequent alternations of beds of purely marine limestone charged with Pro-

ducti and bauds of coal, and is in du-ect analogy with the coal-fields of the Donetz

iu Southern Russia*.
   In sinking through the extensive coal-tracts around Manchester (at Dukinfield),

where one oi the shafts already exceeds in depth the deepest of the Durham mines,

rigorous attention will, I hope, be paid to the discovery of the fossils which cha-
racterize each bed passed through,--not merely to bring about a correctly matm-ed
view of the whole history of these interesting accimiulations, formed when the
siu'face of our planet was first fiu-nished with abundant vegetation, but also for the

practical advantage of the proprietor and miner, who, in certain limited areas, may

thus learn where iron-ores and beds of coal are most likely to be persistent. In

carrying out his siurvey-work through the north-western coal-tracts of Lancashu'e,

to which the large or six-inch Ordnance Map has been applied, one of the Secreta-

ries of this Section, Mr. Hull, has done good service in accurately defining the

tracts wherein the elevated coal-deposits are covered by drift only, in contradi-
stinction to those which are still sm-mounted by red rocks of Permian and Triassic

ago. In seeing that these are eagerly bought by the public, and in recog-nizing the

gi-eat use which the six-inch survey "has proved in the hands of the geological sur-

veyors in Scotland, oiu: friends in and ai-omid Manchester may be led to insist on
having that large scale of sm-vey extended to their own important district. By

refei-ring to the detailed delineations of the outcrops of all the Cai-bonrferous strata

in the counties of Edinbui-gh, Hadding-ton, Fife, and Linlithgow, as noted by

Professor Ramsay and MM. Howell and Geikie, the coal-propriotors of England

will doubtless recognize the gi-eat value of such determinations.

   Concenaing the Permian rocks, which were formed towards the close of the
long palffiozolc era, and constitute a natural sequel to the old Carboniferous depo-

sits, it is to be hoped that we shall here receive apposite illustrations from some of

our associates.

  When Professor Sedgwick, thirty-fom- years ago, gave to geologists his excellent

Memoir on the Mag-nesian Limestone of our country, as it ranges fi-om Durham,
through Yorkshire, into Nottinghamshfre, ho not only described the numerous
varieties of mineral structiu-e which that rock exhibits, noting at the same time its

characteristic fossils, but he also correlated it, and its imderlying beds, with the
Zechstein, Kupferschiefer, and Rothe-todte-liegende of Germany. But whilst this
is the true order in both coimteies, there is this considerable diflerence in England,
that along the zone where the Magnesian Limestone exists as a mass, and where

Sedg-wick described it, the inferior member of the gi-oup is a thin band of sandstone,
usually of a yellow colour (the Pontefract rock of William Smith), which in its
southern extremity, near Nottingham, is almost evanescent. In many parts of
Germany, on the contrary, and notably in Thuringia and Silesia, the same lower

band, with a few intercalated com-ses of limestone, swells out into enormous thick-

nesses and even constitutes lofty ridges.

   In Russia the series of this age puts on a very different mineral aiTangement.
There the calcareous bands, containing the veij same species of shells as the mag-
nesian limestone of Germany and Britain, are intercalated with pebble-beds, sand-
stones, marls, and copper ores, so that, although the same lithological order does

not prevail as in the Saxon or t^'pical Permian coimtiy of the elder German geolo-
gists, the group is, through its fossil types, unquestionably the same. It was from
the observation of this fact, and fi-om seeing that these deposits, so mixed up, yet
so clearly con-elated by then- animal and vegetable relics, and all superposed to the

Carboniferous system, occupied a region twice as large as the British Isles, in

which the varieties of structm-e are best seen in the government of Perm, that I
proposed in 1841 that the wliole group should have the name of ' Permian.'

   Of late yeai-s various British authors, including King, Howse, and others, have

ably described the fossil shells of this deposit as it exists on the eastern side of

--104 REPORT 1861.

the Penine chain ; and recently Mr. Kirkby has produced a carefully written and

well-considered meraoii', showino: the relations of the whole group, by comparing

its sti-ucture and palseontological contents in Durham with those in South York-

myshire. "SMailst, in addition,  associates of the Geological Sun-ey, particularly

Mr. Aveline, have been carefully delmeating the area of these beds in their northern

range from Nottingham through Yorkshire, much yet remains to be done in cor-

relating the Permian rocks lying to the west of the Peuiue ridge, or where wo are

now assembled, with their eastern equivalents.

Already, however, great strides have been made towards this desirable end.

Thus, Mr. Binney has indicated the succession in the neighbom-hood of Manchester,

and has shown us that there some of the characteristic fossils of the eastern magne-

sian limestone exist in red marl and limestones subordinate thereto, and that these

are clearly underlain by other red sandstones, shales, and limestones, which he terms

Lower Permian. He has fm-ther followed these Lower Peimian beds to the west

and north-west, and finds them expanding into considerable thicknesses at Astley,

Scarisbrick, and other places where they overlie the coal-measures, and he has also

traced them into Westmoreland, Cumberland, and Dumfriesshire. In the last case
he went far to prove that which I suggested many years ago, that the red sand-

stones of Dumfriesshire, containing the large footprints of chelonians, as described

by Sir W. Jardine, are of Lower Permian age.

This view of the relations of the Permian rocks of the north-west has been also

taken by Professor Harkness, and this summer he has successfully worked it out,

and has definitely applied the Pennian classification to large tracts in Cmuberland,

as explained in a letter to myself. He finds that the breccias and sandstones of

Kirkby-Stephen and Appleby, which at the latter place have a thickness of three

thousand feet, extend northward on the west side of the Eden (the breccia being

replaced by false-bedded sandstones with footprints), and attain near Carlisle the

enormous thickness of about five thousand feet. These beds he classes unhesi-
tatingly as Lower Pennian, because he finds them to be overlain (near Ormsby) by

a group of clays, sandstones, and mag-nesian lunestones, containing pecidiar plant-

remains and shells of the genus Schizodus, representing in his opinion the marl-

slate and magnesian limestone of Durham. These, again, support beds equivalent

to the Zechstein, and the last are covered by the Triassic sandstone of the Solway.

  A very striking fact, noticed by Professor Harlmess, and corroborative of earlier

researches made by INIr. Binney, is the existence of footprints in the Lower Permian

of Cumberland, similar to those of Corncockle Moor in Dumfriesshire, where, from

my own observations, including those of last year, these Lower Permian sandstones

have, I am convinced, a greater thickness even than that which is assigned to them

in Cumberland.

   Notwithstanding these discoveries, we have still to show the continuous exist-
ence of the Lower Red Sandstone of Shropshire, Worcestershhe, and Staffordshire,

which I have classed as the lower member of the Permian rocks, and to decide
whether it be really such lower member only, or is to be regarded as the equivalent
of the whole Permian group, mider differing mineral conditions. With the exten-

sion of the Geological Survey this pomt will, doubtless, be satisfactorily adjusted,
and we shall then know to what part of the series we are to attach the plant-bear-

ing red beds of Coventry and Wai-wick, described as Pennian by Ramsay and his

Weassociates.  have also to show that, in its northern course, the lower red

sandstone of the central coimties, with its calcareous conglomerates, graduates into

the succession exhibited at Manchester, thence expanding northwards. Already,

however, we have learned that in our own little England, which contains excellent

normal as well as variable types of all the palseozoic deposits, there exists proof

that the Permian rocks, according to the original definition of the same, present to

the observer who examines them to the west as well as to the east of the Penine

chain, nearly as great diversities of lithological structure, in this short distance, as

those which distingiush the strata of the same age in Eastern Russia in Europe fi'om

the original types of the group in Saxony and other parts of Germany.

--in it, as proved by a largely increased demand for oiu- maps and their illustrations,
    a demand whicli will, I doubt not, be much augmented by the translation at an
 early day of many of our field-sui'veyors from the south-eastern and central parts of
 England, where they are now chiefly employed, to those northern districts where

 they will be instrumental in developmg the superior mineral wealth of the region.
    The Government School of Mines, an oflshoot of the Geological Sm-vey, is piima-

 rily intended to fmnish miners, metallurgists, and geological sm-veyors -with the

 scientific training necessary for the successfid pursuit and progi'essive advancement
 of the calling which they respectively pursue ; but, at the same time, the lectures

 and the laboratories are open to all those who seek instruction in physical science
for its own sake, by reason of its important application to manufactures and the
 arts. The experience of ten years has led the Professors to introduce various modi-

 fications into their original progi-amme, with the view of adapting the school as
 clearly as possible to the wants of those two classes of students ; and at present,
 while a definite curriculum, with special rewards for excellence, is provided for those

who desire to become mining, metallurgical, and geological associates of the school,
every student who attends a single course of lecttires may by the new rules compete,

 in the final examination, for the prizes which attach to it only.
    Throughout the whole period of the existence of the school, the Professors have

given annual com-ses of evening lectures to working men, which are always fully
attended, as a part of their regular duty ; and during the past year, several of them
have delivered voluntaiy courses of evening lectiures, at a fee so small as to put
them within the reach of working men, pupil-teachers, and schoolmasters of primary
schools. The Professors thus hope to support to the utmost the gi-eat impulse to-
wards the difiusion of a knowledge of physical science through all classes of the
community, which has been given through the Department of Science and Art by
the Minute of the Committee of Privy Council of the 2nd of June, 1859.

  A body like the British Association for the Advancement of Science should, I

conceive, not be unaware of a step of such vast importance, and tending so entirely

towards the same goal as that to which its own efibrts have been and still are

constantly directed.

   Now, inasmuch as I can trace no record of the teachings of the Government
School of ]\Iines in the volumes of the British Association, and as I am convinced that
the establishment only requires to be more widely known, in order to extend sound
physical knowledge, not merely to miners and geologists, but also to chemists, me-

tallurgists, and naturalists, I have only to remmd my audience that this School of

Mines, which, owing its origin to Sir Henry De la Beche, has furnished om- colonies
with some of the most accomplished geological and mining surveyors, and many a
manufacturer at home with good chemists and metaUiu-gists, has now for its lec-
turers men of such eminence, that the names of Hofinann, Percy, Warington Smyth,

Willis, Ramsay, Huxley, and Tyndall are alone an earnest of our futm'e success.

   In terminating these few allusions to the Geological Survey, and its applications,

I gladly seize the opportunity of recording, that in the days of our founder. Sir Henry
De la Beche, our institution was greatly benefited in possessing for some years, as

one of its leading surveyors, such an accomplished naturalist and sMlfid geologist

as the beloved Assistant General Secretary of the British Association, Professor

Phillips, who by his labours threw much new light on the palaeontology of Devon-

shire, who, in the Memou-s of the Survey, has contributed an admirable Monograph

on the Silurian and other rocks around the Malvern Hills, and who, by his lectures

and writings, is now constantly advancing geological science in the oldest of our

British universities.

   There is yet one subject connected with the Geological Survey to which I mxist

also call your attention, viz. the mineral statistics of the United Kingdom, as com-

piled with great care and ability by Mr. Robert Hunt, the Keeper of the Mining
Records, and published annually in the Memoirs of our establishment.

   These returns made a deep impression on the statists of foreign coimtries who
were assembled last year in London at the International Congress. The Govern-
ment and members of the legislature are now regxdarly furnished with reliable in-

formation as to our mineral produce, which, until very recently, was not obtain-

able. By the labours of ]\Ir. Robert Hunt, in sedulously collecting data from all
quarters, we now become aware of the fact that we are consuming and exporting

about 80 millions of tons of coals annually (a prodigious recent increase, and daily

augmentinor). Of iron-ore we raise and smelt upwards of 8 millions of tons, pro-
ducing 3,826,000 tons of pig iron. Of copper-ore we raise Irom oiu- own mines

--236,696 tons, which jaelcl 15,968 tons of metallic copper ; and from our native

metallic minerals we obtain of tin, 6695 tons ; of lead, 63,525 tons ; and of zinc,
4357 tons. The total annual value of our minerals and coals is estimated at

£26,99-3,573, and of that of the metals (the produce of the above minerals) and

coals at £37,121,318.

   "When we turn from the consideration of the home-sim^ey to that of the geolo-
gical surveys in the numerous colonies of Great Britain, I may well reflect with

pleasure on the fact that nearly all the leaders of the latter have been connected

with, or have gone out from, om* home Geological Sui'vey and the Govemment

School of Mines.

   Such were the relations to us of Sir WiUiam Logan in Canada, of Professor
Oldham in India, with several of his assistants, of Selwyn in A'ictoria, of my young
friend Goidd in Tasmania, as well as of Wall in Trinidad ; whilst BaiTett in Jamaica
is a worthy pupil of Professor Sedgwick. Passing over the many interesting
residts which have arisen out of the examination of these distant lands, we cannot

but be struck with the fact, that whilst Ilindostan (with the exception of the
higher Himalayan mountains) differs so materially in its structiu'o and fossU
contents from Em-ope, Australia (particidaily ^"ictoria) presents, in its palaeozoic
rocks at least, a close analogy to Britain. Thanks to the ability and zeal of
Ml". Selwyn, a large portion of this great auriferous colony has been already surveyed
and mapped out in the clearest manner. In doing this he has demonstrated that
the productive quartzose veinstones, which ai-e the chief matrix of gold, are mainly
subordinate to the Lower Silurian slaty rocks, charged with Trilobites and Grapto-
lites, and peneti-ated by granite, syenite, and volcanic rocks, occupying vast regions,
Mr. Selwyn, aided in the palajontology of his large subject by Prof. M'Coy, has

also shown how these original aiuiferous rocks have been worn down at succes-

sive periods, one of which abrasions is of pliocene age, another of post-pliocene, and

a third the result of existing causes. All these distinctions, as well as the demtar-
cation of the Carboniferous, Oolitic, and other rocks, are cleaily set forth. Looking
with admiration at the execution of these geological maps, it was with exceeding

pain I learnt that some members of the Leglslatm-e of Victoria had threatened to
curtail their cost, if not to stop thefr production. As such ill-timed economy woidd
occasion serious regret among all men of science, and would, I know, be also deeply
lamented by the enlightened Governor, Sir Iloniy Barkly, and would at the same
time be of lasting dissei-vice to the material advancement of knowledge among the
mining classes of the State, let us earnestly hope that the yoimg House of Parlia-
ment at Melbourne may not be led to enact such a measm-e.

   Whilst upon the gi-eat subject of Australian geology, I cannot avoid touching on
a qt((estio vexata -which, has arisen in respect to the age of the coal-fields of that vast
mass of land. Judging by the fossil plants fi'om some of the Carboniferous deposits
of Mctoria, Prof. M'Coy has considered these coaly deposits to be of the Oolitic or

Jm-assic age, whilst the experienced geologist of New South Wales, the Hev. W.

B. Clarke, seeing that, where he has examined these deposits, some of their plants
are like those of the old coal, and that the beds repose confonnably upon and pass
down into sti-ata with true Moimtain-limestono fossils, holds the opinion that the

coal is of palaeozoic age. As Mr. Clai'ke, after citing a case where the coal-seams

and plants were reached below Moimtain-limestone fossils, expresses a hope that

Mr. Goidd may detect in Tasmania some data to aid in deteniiining this question,

I take this opportunity of stating that I will lay before this Meeting a communica-
tion I have just received from Mr. Gould, in which he says that in coal-fields of the

rivers Mersey and Don (some of the veiy few which are worked in Tasmania), he

has convinced himself that the coal imderlies beds containing specimens of true
old Carboniferous fossils. Remarking that these relations are so far unlike those
which he observed on the eastern coast of the island, where the coal overlies, yet
is confonnable to, the Carboniferous limestone, he adds that in Tasmania, at least,
the coal most worked is unquestionably of palaeozoic age.

   Now, as Australia is so vast a region, may not much of the coal within it be of
the age assigned to it by Mr. Clarke 5 and yet, may not Prof. M'Coy bo also light
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                   107

in assigning some of this mineral to the same oolitic a^e as the coal of Brora and

the eastern moorlands of Yorkshire ? In his survey of Tasmania, Mr. Goidd has
also made the important discovery of a resinous shale, termed Dysodile, and which,

like the Torbane mineral of Scotland, promises to be turned to gi-eat account in the

production of paraffine.

   There are, indeed, other grounds for believing that coal, both of the Mesozoic as

weU as of the old Cai-boniferous age, may exist in Australia. Thus, putting aside

the fossil evidences collected in Victoria by M'Coy and Selwyn, we learn, fi-om the

reseai'chcs of Mr. Fi-ank Gregory in Western Australia, that Mesozoic fossil8

(probably Cretaceous and Oolitic) occur in that region ; whilst the Rev. W. B.

Clarke infonns me, in a letter just received, that ho is in possession of a group

of fossils transmitted from Queensland, 700 or 800 miles north of Sydney, which

he is disposed to refer to the age of the Chalk, there being among the fossils Belem-

nites, Pentacrinites, Pecten, Mt/tilits, Modiola, &c. Again, the same persevering

geologist has prociu-ed from New Zealand the remains of a fossil saurian, which, he

thinks, is allied to the Plesiosaiuiis*.

It would therefore appear that in the southern hemisphere there is not merely a

close analogy between the rocks of palceozoic age and our own, but further, that, as

far as the Mesozoic formations have been developed, they also seem to be the equi-

valents of our typical secondaiy deposits.

   This existence of groups of animals ditring the Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous,

and even in Mesozoic periods in Australia and New Zealand, similar to those which

characterize these formations in Europe, is strongly in contrast with the state of nature

Wewhich began to prevail there in the yoimger Tertiary period.  know from the

writings of Owen that at that time the great continent at oui- antipodes was already

characterized by the presence of those marsupial forms which still distinguish its
fauna from that of any other pai't of the world.

   In relation to our Australian colonies, I must also annoimce that I have recently

been gratified in receiving from Messrs. Chambers and Finke, of Adelaide, a collec-

tion of the specimens collected by M'Douall Stuart in his celebrated traverse (the
first one ever made) from South Australia to the watershed of North Australia.
Having had occasion to address the Royal Geographical Society on this point, and
to award its Gold Medal to that most adventurous and successful explorer, with
observations on the main geographical residts of his labours, including the discovery

of trees and plants imknown in other parts of that continent, I may here say, in

addressing myself to geologists, tliat a collection of rocks has been submitted to me
which may tend to illustrate the structure of the interior of that great continent.

These specimens are soft, white, chalky rocks, with flints, agates, saline and

feiTuginous incrustations, tufas, breccias, and white quartz-rocks, and a few speci-

mens of quasi-volcanic rock, but with scarce a fragment that can be referred to the

older stages of Lower Silm-ian age like those of Victoriaf. Again, the only

fossil shells collected by Mr. Stuart (though the precise latitude and longitude are

imlcnown to me) are Mytiloid and Mya-liko forms, seemingly indicating a Tertiary
age, and thus we may be disposed provisionally to infer that large tracts of the low
interior between East and West Australia have in very recent geological periodg

--been occupied by the sea.
   Co)ichmon. In concluding this Address, I may assure the Section that, as one of
the original members of the Association, it gives me infinite satisfaction to return
myto old fi-iends in this great and thriving centre of our national industry. In

common with many of my associates who come from a distance, well do I re-

member how cordially we were received here in the year 1842 ; and never can I
forget how admu-ably wo were presided over by a nobleman J as distinoaiished

by his ability and learning as he was beloved for his philanthropy and public

spirit, and who had upon his right hand the illustrious Dalton. Looking to the cha-
racter and influence of that philosopher, I may truly say that, as he was one of our

founders when we first met together at York, we owe through him a deep debt of
gi-atitude to Manchester ; for Dalton was one of the few eminent men who at our
buih stood sponsor for our future career, and who supported us at many a subse-

quent Meeting.

   In oiu- present visit we are most happy to see placed at our head one of the
scientific men of Manchester, who exhibits in his own person the cheering example

of the gi-eat success which can be attained by the steady and judicious application

of science to the improvement of our manufactures. And if England is to hold her

ovra lofty position in gi-eat measure tkrough the superior strength of the metal

derived from inexhaustible masses of ii-on-ore which occm- in many of her geolooical
formations, we cannot but regard William Fairbaim as the individual, who, united

at first with the lamented Eaton Hodgkinson, through a long series of ingenioas

experiments, as detailed in the volumes of this Association, not only laid the basis

for the erection of the Menai Bridge and such tubular constructions, but who is
now directing the manufactiu'e of those iron plates which may best resist the most

powerful artillery, whether in casing our ships or in strengthening our fortresses.

 I need not re-afBmi that all                                                 the  men  of  science  who  have      flocked  hither  from

_

distant places rejoice with his townsmen in serving imder such a man.
Lastly let me say, that we of the Geological Section, who are gathered together

from remote parts, have solid gi-oxmds for satisfaction in being greeted here by so

many good and active brother workmen of the Geological Society of Manchester,
whohave done such honour to their to^vn, not only by the establishment of a rich
and instructive Museum, in which many of the subjects we are met to discuss are
thoroughly illustrated, but who have also, by their publications, contributed much to
advance our science.

The author said that the specimens before the Meeting were found mainly in
Victoria and Doukerbottom Caves, near Settle, Yorkshire. These caverns are" but

mtwo of a great number which occur in the mountain limestone, and more especially
   the Lower Scar limestone of Phillips. They are of various kinds--diy, wet, from
a few yards in length to a mile, merely passages, or scooped out into great cham-
bers. Doukerbottom consists of two chambers with veiy long passages between
them. Victoiia Cave, which was discovered bv Mi-. Jackson of Settle, has in it

iour large chambers close to each other, and before the flooring of clay was washed
in, probably forming one rfgantic apartment.

The general section of the caves is :--First, from a foot to 18 inches of soU, in which
are the bones of recent and historic animals. Second, about 6 inches of the ancient

floonngof the cave when it was inhabited by man: in this were fomid all the
antiquities which were discovered, and the bones of animals simUar to those last
mentioned. Third, dense stifiP clay of veiy gi-eat thickness, in which no antiquities
and scarcely any bones were found. Fourth, the original rocky floor of the cave,

the cave                                   but besides these were fibulse, annlets and lings of bronze and iron,

corns of Roman emperors, from Nero to Constantine. The bones found were of
recent and histonc animals, such as the wild boar and the wolf; but with these
were others of prehistoric animals, the cave-tiger and the cave-hyeena, found side
by side with the antiquities ; and it has been argued that they are therefore con-

temporaneous with man. The author, however, showed that their presence in such
a position waa accidental, and proved too much ; for if these bones were contem-

Sorary with the antiquities, they were also contemporary with the coins, which come
 own to 400 A.D.--a time at which we are certain, from history, that there were no

msuch animals England. The present evidence from these caverns of man's con-

temporaneousness with such animals was not to be trusted.

A succinct account of the Geological Features of the neighbourhood of Man^

                     Chester. Bij E. W. Binnet, F.B.S., F.Q.8.

   The author described the several beds of gravel, sand, and clay forming the super-

--ficial covering of the district in the following (descending) order : 1st, The valley

gravel, with its successive terraces, reaching to a thickness of .36 feet ; 2nd, the

widely-distributed upper sand and gravel, 135 feet ; 3rd, the till, boulder- or brick-

clay, 90 feet ; 4th, the lower gravel and sand, 40 feet. The underlying rocks or
skeleton of the coimtry, known chiefly by boring operations, were then noticed :
1st, the pebble-bed of the Trias, about 600 feet thick. 2nd. The Permian series, con-

sisting of marls containing beds of limestone and gj'psimi, about 300 feet in thick-

ness j conglomerate, 25 ; and soft red sandstone, about 600 feet. These may be

considered as the upper part of the Permian beds of Lancashire, but the equivalents

mof the lower series Yorkshire. Below them come in soft red sandstones and

beds of pebbly grit containing coal-plants, seen at Astley and Bedford, but not met
with in the immediate vicinity of Manchester. The beds of conglomerate and soft

red sandstone are found to thicken out northward in Lancashire, Westmoreland,

Cumberland, and Scotland to several thousand feet in thickness. 3rd. The coal-

measures of the Manchester coal-field, 1G50 feet thick, as proved by sinkings and

borings, and the few natiu-al sections at i\j'dwick and elsewhere. All these

strata are much dislocated, one fault being certainly a downthrow of 3150 feet at
one point, and only 150 at another not many miles off. Some faults show evidence
of great lateral motion. He regarded these faults as having been made for the most

Eart immediately after the close of the Carboniferous era ; they were further shifted
  efore the deposition of the Trias, and no doubt had been frequently moved after-

wards. The author illustrated his remarks by a geological map of the district,
showing the distribution of the superficial clays, gi'avels, and sands j another map

--showing the arrangement of the lower rocks as far as yet determined ; and by three

sections of the district one from Trinity Chm-ch, Hulme, to Waterhouses, another

&om the Exchange to Smedley, and the third from Eccles to Kersal Moor.

             On the Extinct Volcanos of Australia, By J. Boitwick.

   Having lately visited the extinct volcanos of Italy and France, as well as having
observed the active cone of Vesuvius, the author did not think he was wrong in
calling the south-western part of Victoria and the adjacent portion of South Aus-
tralia the burnt fields of Australia. The coimtry referred to lies chiefly between
the slate and gi-anite dividing range of the diggiug-s and the tertiary limestone of
the sea-coast, having an area of nearly half the size of England. It extends from
the Bay of Port Phillip, near Melboimie, and Geelong, to beyond the western border
of Victoria, by the Glenelg. The great basaltic plain of the west has few interrup-
tions from the bay to the border and from the shore to the central range. The
basalt is of all varieties, and furnishes in its decomposition the finest soU to the

agricultmist. He had seen an island of basalt in a sea of slate, so to speak, which

abounded with farms, though sun-oimded by heartless woods and shingle soil.

Many dome-shaped lava hills are foimd on the plateau of the dividing range. Ca-
verns, nearly 500 feet in length, exist in the basaltic floor of the plains. On the

south-west side of the great salt lake Corangamite, there are basaltic rises. These
are huge baniers fi-om 10 to 60 feet in height, fonning a vast labyrinth of rocks,

15 miles long by 12 broad. The natives in olden times retreated to these inacces-
sible retreats with the sheep they stole from the flocks in the neighbourhood. The
ash or tufa has the same appearances as those the author observed at Lake Albano,
near Rome, and at Pompeii. It is occasionally sufficiently solidified to become
building-stone. Carvings are very commonly made of it in the district. The

rence, in Portland Bay. Clift's of this singular compound rise there 150 feet. The
author's impression is that the source was a submarine volcano to tlie south-west,

--the com'se of the preTailing wind and cmTent ; and that the ashes and volcanic

dust were received in some sheltered bay, since raised with the coast. The extinct
volcanos are in the form of lakes and moimtains. The lakes are depressions usually
on slight eminences. Terang, Elingamite, Pm-rumbete, Wangoon, and Lower Hill
are fresh, while Keilambete and Bulleenmem ai-e salt. The shallow saline lakes
of the plains were not fonner cratei-s. The depths of some of these lakes are 50,
100, 150, 200, and 300 feet. The Devil's Likstand of Mount Gambior is 260 feet.
The banks vaiy from a few feet to 300 feet in height above the water. The cir-
cmuference varies from 100 yaixls to 7 miles. The thickness of the ash in-
creases with the distance from the crater, but is always thickest on the eastern side.
At Lower Hill, at a quai-ter of a mile from the bank, on the northern quarter, it is
80 feet deep, while at a mile oft^ on the eastern side, it is 150 feet. The volcanic hills
vai-y from a few yaixls to above 2000 feet above the sea-level. The depth of the
dry craters rmis from 50 feet to 300 feet. Gambler and Schanck are within the
South Australian border. The former has three fine lakes. The latter is a dry
basin, known as the Devil's Pimchbowl. Porudon is a cone of veiy light cinder,
elevated amidst the remarkable rises. Lem'a is a broken crater on the edge of the
rises ; while PuiTimibete is a beautiful sheet of water, a few miles distant, which
once, as a crater, discharged vast quantities of ash. The other princijial volcanos
of Western Victoria ai'e Buninyong, Blowhard, Noorat, Gellibrand, Napier, Franklin,

Cavern, Shadwell, Lower Hill, Clay, Elephant, Eckerslej'. No adequate impression

can be received as to the age of the activity of these cones and cratei's. There is

a fi-eshness in most of them indicative of a comparatively modem date. The
natives have traditions of the eruptions of several of them. As loam overspreads

the recently scattered amiferous drift of several of the diggings, it woidd not appeal"
to have been of gi-eat date. It occui'S on tertiary limestone to the west, and imder-

lies it as well.

   Mr. Antonio Brady exliibitcd some flint instnmients, together with bones of
El-ephas prwtif/emus and Echini, obtained by him only a few days since from the
drift at St. Achoul, near Amiens. He stated that aithough found only a few feet

above the chalk, in the drift, in true association with the bones and shells of extinct
species, still, from the composition of the drift, there was in his judgment no proof
that the animals and the makers of the instnmients lived at one and the same time.

From the heterogeneous and rolled state of the materials, there was gi-eat reason to
believe that they had been disinterred from their original resting-places by some
sudden torrent or convulsion, and been reinterred in their present association. The
drift had clearly never been lifted by the hand of man, but is doubtless in the state
in which it was deposited, whenever that may have been.

                              On ilie Aqueous Origin of Granite.

                   By Alexander Bktson, F.B.8.E., P.B.S.S.A.

   In this paper the author referred to the labours of Dr. William Smith, who pub-
lished his ' Tabular View of the British Strata ' in 1790, and remarked that since

that period geology had been studied mainly in the direction of paleontology.
Physical, chemical, and dynamic geology were left almost unregai'ded by the great

masters of the science, who generally accepted the specidations of Hutton and the

experiments of Hall as demonstrating the igneous origin of the primary rocks.

   The author stated that the Huttonian theoiy was most ably attacked, and, in his
opinion, overthrown, by Dr. MiuTay in his ' Comparative "\"iew of the Huttonian
and Neptunian Sj-stems of Geology,' a work most unaccountably overlooked. Since
that time it had sugg-ested itself to the sagacious mind of Davj', that the occmTence

of fluids in the cavities of crystals seemed to point to an aqueous origin. He also

alluded to the wiitings of Brewster, Sivewiight, and Nicol in the same field ; also

to Becquerel, Fuchs, Bischoff", and Delesse, who have taken up the subject of the
aqueous origin of rocks from a chemical point of \'iew. The author then laid before

the Society the result of ten years' experimental investigation into the sti'ucture of
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTION?.  IH"

rocks relative to their formation, more particulai-ly granite. While examining'
microscopically the various pitclistoue veins abounding in Arran, he was much
struck with the similarity of their structure, and the marked ditference they exhi-
bited when compared with sections of granite and its various mineral constituents.

On extending his observations to obsidian, marekanite (a volcanic glass from Lake

Marekan in Kamtschatka), and also to the well-known glassy obsidian of Bohemia,

he foimd they all exhibited a structure analogous to the pitchstones of AiTan. He

further foimd that sections of glass slags, where the heat had been long continued,

combined with slow cooling, all presented the same appearances as the sections of

pitchstone.

   This structure, peculiiir to igueously formed substances, ho found usually to radiate

in a stellate form ; and though many slags showed large stars visible to the naked
eye, the stellate structure is more easily observed by the aid of the microscope.
The character is so marked, that no one whose eye is tutored to microscopic obser-

vation can fail to recognize at once a mineral substance of igneous origin.

   In granite, on the other hand, the structiu-e, as seen by the microscope, is as per-
sistent as in pitchstone, glass, and obsidian, but totally different.

   In the many experiments which the author had tried with granites from various

localities, he had never succeeded in obtaining one instance of stellate structure,
while the constant occun-ence of cavities containing fluids convincedj him that, if
pitchstone and glass are types of igneous-formed substances, granite must be of

aqueous origin. In the fluid cavities so abundant in topaz, Caimgomm, beryl,

toiuTiialine, and felspar, all constituents of granite, he found the same appearance
prevailed. These cavities are seldom entirely filled with fluid, an air-bubble usu-

ally occupying more or less of the cavity. After many hundred experiments on
such cavities, the author found that when exposed to a temperature of 94° Fahr.,

the bubble disappeared, the fluid entirely filling the cavity, and at the temperatm-e
of 84° the bubble re.ippeared with a sing-ular ebullition, showing that the .au' had

formed an atmosphere round the fluid. He was thus led to infer that these cavities

coidd not have been filled at a temperatm-e above 84°, and certainly not above 94°

of Fahrenheit.

   As anotlier proof that these cavities could not have been filled when the tempe-
ratm-e of the surroimding rock was higher than the temperature above indicated,
the author drew attention to the fact that the bubble of air occupied always a much
smaller portion of the cavity than the iluid, a condition which could not obtain, i:^

as other wi'iters hold, the fluids were enclosed imder intense heat and pressure.
   For the purpose of accm-ately determining the temperatures at which the bubble

vanished and reappeared, the author constructed an apparatus which he exhibited

and described. It consists of a microscope with a hollow iron stage, having a tube

in the centi'e to admit light from the reflector. At one side, and inserted into the

stage, is a small tin retort with a stopper ; at the other side, a tube is inserted and
attached to a reservoir of water, fi-om which the hollow stage and retort are filled.

On applying heat to the retort by means of a spirit-lamp, any requhed temperature
under the boiliug-pomt of the water may be obtained in the stage and retort.

   Above the stage is placed an iron saucer, in the centre of which an iron tube is
riveted, thi'ough which the light is admitted ; this vessel is filled with mercury, and
in it is placed an upright thermometer, with the bulb shielded with cork or any other
good non-conductor ; by this means it indicates the actual temperature of the mer-
cury bath. The cavity to be observed is cemented with Canada balsam to a plate

of glass 3x1 inch, and is floated on the smface of the mercury, so that the glass
and mercmy are in absolute contact. When the temperature is raised imtil the

bubble nearly disappears (which is seen by its contraction), the spirit-lamp is with-
drawn, aud the vanishing point carefully watched and the temperatiu'e noted. The
stopper of the retort is then withdrawn, and the stopcock of the reservoir of water
opened, so that the temperature of the stage and mercm-y bath is soon reduced, and
the ebullition or reappearance of the bubble takes place, when the temperature is

again recorded. By this method the author felt confldent that his results were
con-ect, as they always were consistent when observing the same cavity. By means

of this instrument the author had found fluid cavities in the trap tutf of Arthur's

Seat, the greenstone of the Crags, and the basalt of Samson's Ribs. He had also
foimd that the porphyry of Duu Dhu in Arran, which jnost geologists asaime^ 03

of igneous origin, was full of fluid cavities contained in tlio doubly acuminated

crystals of quartz for which this remarkable porphyry is distinguished. He also

mshowed doubly acuminated crystals of quartz the saliferous gypsums of India,

both of which were full of fluid cavities, and the (quartz impressed with the gypsiim
and as no geologist would hold that this fonnation was of igneous origin, but that
the quartz, if not contemporaneous with the gj^sum, must have been subsequent,

and as the same phenomena were presented by the porphyry of Dun Dhu, he was
forced to the conclusion that it was as much aqueous in its origin as the saliferous
gypsum of India. The author exhibited a specimen of quartz which contained a

ciystal of iron pyi'ites, to which was attached a crystal of galena and also a small

massy zinc blende, while over these three metals was laid a covering of gold. From
this specimen he argued, that as all these metals were fusible at a much lower

temperature than quartz, they must have aggregated during a gelatinous condition

of the quartz ; and fiulher, that as the sidphides of the three metals were in chemi-
cally combining proportions, any heat which would have fused the quartz woidd
have made an alloy or a slag in which chemical combining proportions coidd not

occur.

   He also exhibited specimens of schorl which he had obtained in the granite of

Aberdeen, and drew the inference that schorl, which crackles and splits with a very

small increment of temperature, coidd not have been present dm-ing a molten con-
dition of the quartz ; and that it was crystallized prior to the solidifying of the
latter, as proved by tlie schorl impressing the quartz. The author, from a carefid

examination of the schorls in the quartzite of Aberdeen, was led to believe that the

quartz, while in the process of crystallization, expanded one twenty-fourth of its
bulk, a force which appeared to him to be suf&eient to cause all the upheavals and
disruptions which had led geologists to account for such phenomena by a molten
condition of the primary rocks. If this \'iew is coi-rect, and if the highest peak is

granite, as the lowest is known to be granite, the author calculated that as the

highest moimtain is only yf^ part of the radius of the earth, a thickness of the crust
of 168 miles is quite sulflcient to yield expansive force to raise the highest peak of

the Himalayan range. He fm'ther stated that the cause of the temperature at which

the fluids were confined being higher than the normal one, depended on the rise of
temperature which takes place during solidification.

   The author, in conclusion, trusted he would soon be in a position to confirm
these views when he had finished the investigation of the trap-rocks with which he
is now engaged.

   The formations treated of were the upper palaeozoic marine deposits and the coal-
measures. The apparent conformability of the two sections was shown, together
with their intimate connexion, serving to render their consideration inseparable. The

coal-measures exist to a greater or less extent throughout the coimtry referred to,

the depth being about 900 feet. The coal-measures of the district might be regarded

as constituting two distinct fields, the maximum one of which might be termed the
Mount Nicholas Coal-field, comprehending the various portions developed upon
either side of the Break o' Day Valley, while to the other the term Dou^as River

Coal-field might be applied, as indicating the area occupied by the carboniferous
formation between Long Point and Bicheno. In the first the position of the prin-
cipal seams of coal, although highly advantageous to their being worked, is at an
elevation of from 1200 to 1500 feet above the sea. There were at least six distinct
seams in the Mount Nicholas coal-field, one of which was of superior quality, and
12 feet in thickness. Ever since the discovery of the seam experiments have been
made, which, though amply suificient to prove the value of the coal for domestic
purposes and fc- application to the usual branches of manufacture, have been upon

                  On the Faults of a portion of the Lancashire Coal-field.
          By A. H. GrREEiT, M.A., of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.

      In this paper a law was enunciated which appeared to govern the directions of

   the principal lines of fault in the portion of the Lancashire coal-field lying between

   the meridians of Wigan on the west and Rochdale on the east.
      On the western side of this tract the average direction of the faults is about 20°

   W. of N. ; as we go eastwards the lines of fracture tend more and more towards an
   E. and W. direction, till in the neighbom'hood of Rochdale they are found to run
   from 45^ to 50° W. of N.

     An attempt was made to show, on the principles laid down by Mr. Hopkins in

   the sixth volume of the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, that this law was a
   necessary cousec[uence of the elevating forces which produced the upheaval of the

   coal-field.

      The iipheaving forces seem to have exerted their greatest force along the north-

   em and eastern bomidai'ies, increasing in each case towards the north-east corner

   the western boundary seems to have been a line of upheaval of smaller and more
   unifomi intensity ; and on the south, where the coal-measures pass below the new
   red sandstone, the force of upheaval has decreased to a miuinnun. ·

      Hence it was inferred that the southern and western boimdaries of the coal-field
   might be considered as remaining imdisturbed daring the upheaval, while its north-
   eastern corner had been elevated. The extension of the strata produced by this
   upheaval, as soon as it exceeded their power of cohesion, would cause fissures ; and
   the dii'ections of these fissures, indicated by theory, coincide very nearly with the

   observed lines of the principal fiiidts.

   Comparison of Fossil Insects of England and Bavaria. By Dr. Hageit.

                       (Communicated by H. T. Stainton, F.L,S.)

   The author remarked that formerly the fossiliferous strata of Solenhofen and

   Eichstadt in Bavaria had been considered analogous to the English secondary strata,

   but that later investigations had established that the latter were considerably older.
   " I must especially call attention to the fact, that the species described by Gemiar

   in the ' Acta Academice Leopold,' to which hitherto reference has always been made,
   are described from specimens the outline of which has been artistically painted and

   completed. I have often examined the types carefully, and can maintain with cer-

   tainty that this accoimt of them is correct. The Royal Collection in the Academy

   of Mimich, and the collection of Dr. Crantz in Bonn, contain together about 1000

   stones with insects, and, even deducting the double stones, thus represent at least

   GOO specunens.
      " Having an opportunity a few weeks back of studying very carefully the Munich

   collection, I was much sm-prised at the splendid preservation of many of the speci-

   mens. The insects of the Solenhofen strata are almost universally preserved entire

   wings, legs, head, and antennae are in their proper places ; most of the LibeUulcs have

   thek wings expanded. He who, on the sandy shores of the Baltic, has noticed
   how depositions of insects are now taking place, will admit that these Solenhofen

   insects must have been dead when deposited. They woidd be di'iven by the winds

   into the sea, thrown on the shore dead or dying, and then gradually covered with

   sand by the rippling waves. This process took place on the Solenhofen strata

   extremely gradually and slowly, as is evident from another circumstance ; for we

   frequently find the ca\ities of insects (the head, thorax, and body) filled up with

   regular crystals of calcareous spar. Hence the pressui-e of the stratum overlying
   the insect must have been very alight, when such delicate parts as the abdominal

   segments of a dragon-fly could oppose resistance for a sufiicient length of time to

   admit of the formation of crystals.

    " The English strata, on the other hand, rarely contain entire insects generally
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

there are only some part of the wings, abdomen, and thorax, and these besides are
usually imperfect. Hence it appears worthy of consideration whether the insects
of the English strata do not convey the inference that, through the agency of stoims
and other commotions, the fragments were tossed about a long time before they
found a resting-place.

    " There is the less to be said against this conjecture, as the wings of insects
(which form by far the larger part of the English entomological fossils) are almost
indestructible in water. I have kept the wings of dragon-flies in water for years
without observing the slightest change in their texture.

   " From a careful study of the fossils of Solenhofen, and a comparison with the

published figures of the fossil insects of England, I have deduced two conclusions :
   " First, that the two faunae are very closely allied, and possibly some species in

both formations are identical.
   " Secondly, that the fauna3 of Solenhofen and of the English strata are not only

quite distinct from the existing fauna, but also from those of Aix, of the Rhenish
peat-deposit of (Eningen and Kadoboj, and from that of amber, differing not only

m species but in genera.

   "Almost all the Solenhofen insects will necessitate the construction of new
genera, which, however, wiU often furnish connecting links between some of our

existing genera.

   " In reference to the Odmiata (dragon-flies), which fonn so large a portion of the
insect fauna of the Solenhofen strata, and pieces of the wings of which seem not

uncommon in the English strata, we iind a remarkable contrast between the faima
of the English secondary sti-ata and the fauna of ffiuingon and Radoboj. Whereas

here, as also in the Rhenish peat, lai-vaa and pupfe of Lihclhdce are found in great

numbers, many often lying together, the perfect insects beino' proportionally scarce

in the Solenhofen and Eichstadt deposits Libcllulce are precisely the most plentiful
specimens (forming |rd of all tlie insects.), and on the other hand, up to the present
time not a single larva or pupa has been foimd.

   " The absence of larvre in the Solenhofen strata may be accounted for by the

supposition that the waters on whose shores these strata' were deposited were salt
just as at the present day numerous Odonata are buried in the sands on the shores
of the Baltic, although their larvas do not live in that sea. The deposits of Oilningen
and Radoboj, on the other hand, we must conclude were made in fresh water."

On the Old Red Sandstone of South Perthshire.
   By Professor HARKirass, F.B.S., F.G.S.

At the Bridge of Allan, which is situated immediately on the north side of the

fault separating the coal-field of StirUng'shire from the Old Red Sandstones on the

noi-th thereof, tliere are seen, on tlie side of the hill near the well, conglomerates

which are principally made up of fragments of trap, and these, in their higher

beds, have grey sandstones intercalated with them. These grey sandstones, on

ascending the series, occur exclusively; and they are well seen at Wolfs Hole

quai-ry, dipping at 20°N.W., being capped by trap. Here, in the grey sandstones,

the remains of Pteraspis rostratus have been found, and in the same strata portions

of a Cephalaspis also occur.

A section shovnug the arrangement of the deposits which succeed these grey

Asandstones may be seen in the course of the Allan to beyond Dumblane.  con-

tinuation of this section may bo obtainetl in the course of the Teith ; and the river

Keltic, which flows into the Teith about .3 miles below Callander, furnishes the

series of deposits which join those of the Teith. Collectively a section may be had

showing the natm-e anA the arrangement of the deposits which occupy the area

between the fault alluded to as occurring on the south, and the metamorphic rocks

of the southern flanks of the Grampians.

   This section exhibits a trough on the margins of which conglomerates occur,
these forming the lowest strata.

   To these conglomerates succeed deposits which contain Pteraqns and Cepha-

laspis, consisting of grey sandstones. Pui-ple strata occur above these, to which
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  115

succeed reddish slialy beds ; and, on the S.E. side of the section, brown sandstones
are found upon the shales, while on the N.W. side these brown sandstones contain
also quartz conglomerates. Upon this portion of the series grey flaggy sandstones
are seen, and these form the highest members of the rocky strata observable in this

portion of Scotland.

   The total thickness of the deposits which this section exhibits exceeds 7000 feet,
and it is interesting not only as showing the position of the Pteraspis beds, but
also as indicating an area south of the Grampians where, underneath the Forfar-
shire flags, a thick mass of conglomerate forms the lowest members of the Old Red

Sandstone formation.

'On the Sandstones and their associated Deposits of the Valley of the Eden and

         the Cumberland Plain. By Professor Harkness, F.R.S., F.G.S.

     In the yalley of the Eden, from a short distance south of Kirkby Stephen north-!

 ward, there occur extensive developments of sandstone, which, in many localities

 south of Appleby, have beds of breccia associated with them. These sandstones,
 having usually a nearly eastern dip, are spread over the western portion of the Vale
 of the Eden in Cmnberland, and have as their western boundaries the Carboniferous
 series. In Cumberland they attain a great thickness, probably nearly 5000 feet.
 They possess the same mineral nature as the sandstones which in Dumfriesshire
 aflbrd footprints ; and Ichnolites of a like character to those of the south of Scotland
 have been foimd in some localities in these Cumberland deposits. They are usually
 succeeded conformably by clays of a red colour. In some areas these clays contain
 gypsum ; and at one spot, near the village of Hilton in Westmoreland, there is seen,
 between the sandstones and breccias below and the clay-beds above, a thin series

 of deposits which vary much in their lithology. The lower portion of these has
 a chai-acter approaching that of the marl-slate of Durham, and from this fdBsils are

 obtained, principally in the fonn of coniferous leaves. Casts of small crinoid

 stems are also seen, and likewise casts of Brachiopods and Lamellibranchiates. The
 facies which these fossils present, induces the conclusion that the strata which
 contain them represent here the marl-slate. Under these circumstances the suc-
 ceeding marls and gypsvma must be looked upon as appertaining to the Zechstein
 portion of the Permians, while the luaderlying red sandstones and breccias must
 be regarded as the equivalent of the German llothliegende, which in this portion of
 England have a veiy gi'eat development, and which, as they contain the footprints

 before alluded to, place the PeiTuians of Dumfriesshire that afford Ichnolites among

 the lowest gi-oup of this formation.

    The clay-beds which represent the Zechstein are conformably succeeded by fine-
 grained red sandstones with clay layers. These aboimd in ripple-marks, desiccation-
 cracks, raiu-pittino's, and pseudomorphs, features which are never found in con-
 nexion with the inferior sandstones. These upper sandstones seem rather to
belong to the Trias than the Permians. They trougli under the Solway Firth, being
 well developed in the S.E. of Dumfriesshire ; and they appear to support the lias,
as this has been described as occumng in the north of Cumberland by Mr. Binney.

   The author described a number of examples of them in Berwickshire, Roxburgh-
shire, and other places. He stated that they were so regular as to have the appear-
ance of railway embankments or fortifications, and that they had often been mistaken
for the latter. They were from 40 feet to 60 feet in height, and sometimes could
be traced for three or four miles. They were found at various heights above the
sea up to 750 feet. In examining their internal sti'ucture, they were seen to con-
sist generally of sand, gravel, and boidders ; the latter generally roimded, but also

occasionally angular. He adverted to the fact that they are sometimes intersected

by rivulets and even rivers, but that notwithstanding this, they had all the appear-
ance of having, when originally formed, been continuous. The author offered some
remarks on the agency supposed to have been concerned in the production of the

kaims. He repudiated the notion of their formation by glaciers. He considered

they were due to the action of water, as indicated by their internal structure ; and
supposed that they must have been formed by the waters of the ocean, when they
stood at least 800 feet above its present level. The only question, as he thought,
was, whether they had been thrown up as submarine spits or banks, or whether they
had been formed hj a process of scooping-out, when the land emerged from the
ocean. His opinion wavered between these two views ; but he was inclined to the
former. In the east of Scotland, these kaims had mostly one direction, viz. east
and west; and as they were in various positions, sometimes on level land and
sometimes on sloping hills) he thought that a sudden lift of the country out of
the ocean would better produce that uniformity of direction than any other view,
and also occasion the scooping-out and removal of materials, leaving continuous ^

ridges.

   The author refeiTcd to the observations of Prof. Phillips in Yorkshii-e in reference
to the carboniferous rocks, from which it appeared that the calcareous portions

attained their greatest vertical development towards the south-east, while the
sedimentary strata of the Yoredale series and millstone grit increased in thickness
towards the north-west ; and the author went on to show that what was true in
Yorkshire on a smaller scale, was also true on a larger scale for the whole of the
carboniferous rocks north of the old barrier of laud which stretched across Central
England dm-ing the Carboniferous epoch.

   It was shown that the carboniferous limestone was most fully developed in
Derbyshire, attaining a thickness of about 5000 feet, and from this as a centre it
thinned away westward and northward, so that in Scotland the thickness was only
about 250 feet, in some places even less than this.

   On the other hand, it was shown that the sedimentary strata (sandstones, shales,

&c.) were of greatest thickness in Lancashire, and from this thinned away east-
ward, southward, and partially westward. The thickness of these sti-ata in Lanca-
shire (12,500 feet) had probably once been exceeded in Scotland, where, reasoning
from analogy, Mr. Hull concluded the whole carboniferous group, excluding the
limestones, had once reached 14,000 feet, previous to the denudation which has
swept away the uppermost members of the coal-measiu"es*.

   These variations in thickness of the sedimentary strata were indicated by the
isometric lines on the maps exhibited to the Section, and are accounted for on the
g-roimd that, throughout the Carboniferous period, a large tract of land had existed
in the North Atlantic, from which the sediment had been derived and spread over
the bed of the sea by a current coming from the north-west. In consequence of
this, the sands and clays would gi-adually lessen in quantity the further they were
canied, and thus they would be deposited in greatest force towards the north-west,
and in least towards the south-east, where there would be a clear sea.

   On the other hand, the limestones, being due to the labours of marine animals
which required an ocean free from mud for their full development, were formed in

gi'eatest force in Derbyshire, and from this as a centre diminish in thickness west-
ward and northward. Thus in Scotland they are on the point of disappearing,
being replaced by a vast thickness of sedimentary strata altogether wanting in
 Central England. These variations were indicated by a second system of isometric
lines, indicating the propagation of the calcareous rocks from Derbyshire as a centre
in a series of waves of constantly diminishing force. It would thus be seen that
the two sets of isometi-ic lines above refen-ed to would intersect each other from

nearly opposite directions.

    To account for these opposite developments, the author showed that they arose
from the necessity of things ; that the marine animals (as the corals and crinoids),

    * These results were borne out by admeasurements of the beds in several counties, which
 are published at length in the Joui'nal of the Geological Society of London, vol. xviii. p. 127.

of whose labours mainly the limestones are the result, required a pure oceaa

imcontaminated by sediment. This was the case v/iili the ocean in Derbyshire
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but in the north it was charged with sand and mud, which interfered with, and

idtimately oTerpowered the organic agents. Hence the essential distinction be-

tween limestones and all other binds of sedimentary strata was strongly insisted

upon, the one being directly antagonistic to the other.

The author next showed that we could trace at inteiTals the north and south

coasts of a barrier of land which stretched from Wales to the Gennan Ocean diuing

the Carboniferous period. (See Map, Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xviii.)

South of this bamer there exists another carboniferous tract, represented by the

coal-fields of South Wales, Somersetshire, Gloucestershire, and possibly of one imder-

lying the cretaceous rocks and stretching into Belgium. This tract was separated

by the barrier fi-om that of Central England, and the sediment had been carried from

a different direction. The isometric lines, di-awn in accordance with the vaiiations

of thickness as described by Sir H. De la Beche, showed that the sediment had

been carried by a current coming from the W.S.W., while the calcareous group

had been propagated in greatest abundance from the east ; so that on the south

side of the barrier there was as great a conti-ast in the distribution of the calcareous

and sedimentaiy strata as on the north side.

 The  author  next  proceeded  to  remark  that  America  exhibited  phenomena of  a

_

kind similar to those here described in Britain. As had been shown by Sir C. Lyell

and Prof. Eogers, the sedimentaiy strata augmented towards the ]Sf.E. in Nova

Scotia, and became attenuated in the basin of the Mississippi (in which direction

the limestones increase in vertical dimensions), proving that the sediment had been

drifted from the north-east. The autlior contended that the same great continent

of the North Atlantic had been the progenitor of the carboniferous strata of both

America and Britain, and that its shores were swept by a north-east current in the

western hemisphere, and by a north-west cm-rent in the eastern.

On the Relation of the EsMale Granite at Booth to the Schistose Eocl-s, with
   Bemarl-s on the General Metamorphic Origin of Granite. By J. G. Mae-

    snAiL, F.G.S.

   In a paper read by me at the Meeting of the British Association at Leeds in

1858, on the Geology of the Lake District, I endeavoiued to establish the following

propositions :

   1. That the older slate rocks of Cumberland and Westmoreland, the Skiddaw clay-
slate, and the greenstone slate series, have been generally subject to the metamor-
phic action of heat, pressure, and moistm-e.

   2. That some of the slaty beds being more fusible than others above or below
them in the series, have been more acted on than the less fusible beds, and changed
into poi-phyries, whilst the others have only been hardened ; and hence an alterna-
tion of stratified and unstratified beds has resulted, though the whole series were

originally soft stratified deposits.

 --3. That the granites and syenites of this district are as truly metamorphic rocks

as the porphyries the change to the crystalline structure being merely the last
term, the extreme residt of the metamorphic action of combined heat, pressm-e, and

moisture, followed by veiy slow cooling ; and that these rocks, when found in mass,

are not eruptive or intrusive, but altered beds of slate rock in situ in their natural
position as regards other beds in the series.

   4. That the forces which have elevated, contorted, and fractured the strata of
this district have not been the eruptive energies of the gr-anites and syenites, but
have been produced by the expansion or contraction of the earth's crust, by heating
or cooling on a large scale, and chiefly shown in great lateral thnists, producing
flexures and fractures in the weaker portions of the crust of the earth.

118 REPORT 1861.

   The metamorphic rocks iu the vicinity of Bootle, under Black Comb, have been
noticed by Sedgwick, and also by Phillips, as offering many remarkable phenomena
and as the granite was not considered by either of these observers as a metamoi-jjhic
rock, I have been induced to pay another short visit to the locality in order to

examine especially the evidence for or against that supposition.
   The first point which I examined was the appearance of granitic rock in the

com-se of a branch of the stream which runs through Bootle from Black Comb, and

called Hole GUI. This rock fii-st appears in a quan-y near the enti-ance of the ravine

--through which the stream descends Black Comb. It is seen in three places two on

the southern side and one on the northern side, and all near the bottom of the

ravine and within a distance of 300 or 400 yards. This rock (specimens Nos. 1 & 2),

though of a felspathic and gi-anitic character, is far from being a perfectly fomied

granite, and appeared to me to be quite analogous to the transition beds so constantly
observed in the slaty rocks when the metamorphic change is just commencing.

Moreover, in the spot where this rock appears on the northern side of the ravine,

it is seen distinctly dipping conformably imder the soft clay-slate, at an angle of

about 25° or 30° to N.W.
  I am of course familiar with the syenitic dykes which so frequently occur in this

district, and have followed several of them for miles ; but I could see no appearance of
vertical or unconformable position in these gi-anitic rocks in Hole GiU to indicate

that they were dykes or elvans. They had rather the appearance of beds of the clay-
slate in which the metamoi-phic action was commencing ; and they appear at the

very base of Black Comb, and nearly on a level with the adjacent metamorphic rocks

of the greenstone slate formation.

   The next appearance of metamorphic action is at a distance of about half a mile
northward from the ravine just mentioned, in a range of slate rock which in the

distance of 300 or 400 yards is gradually and completely changed fi-om a perfectly

fissile and imaltered slate at the southern end to a compact massive greenstone and

  orphyry at the other or northern end (Nos. 3-8 specimens), where it is intersected

Iy another branch of the Bootle sti-eam. It would be impossible to find a more

perfect example than this ridge of rock affords of gradual metamoi-phic change along

"the line of strike. Between this second branch of the stream and a third branch,

about half a mile fm'ther north, there is a broken hUloclcy lidge of metamorphic slate

changed into hard greenstone and poi-phjiy, and the beds much tossed about and

dislocated (specimens 9-11).

The third branch of the stream intersects the border of the granitic range of

rocks, which from this point extend continuously to the Esk and up Eskdale.

  when first seen in situ the granite is very soft, incoherent, and disintegrating so

as to be little more than granitic sand, and yet in the faces of the escai-pment

formed by the stream in this soft mass all the marks of sti-atification and jointing

of the original slate rocks, of which it appears to have been formed, are distinctly

visible. This granite is hornblendic, and shows the nodular and concretionai'y

Astructure.    little further north, in a plateau or moderately elevated ridge, the

granitic rock appears in a hard and solid state ; the fomis of the blocks, however,

when in mass in situ, still preserving the angular and prismatic foims of the adja-

cent greenstone and porphyry beds, and with the same dislocated and broken ap-

pearance.

I could not anywhere see any distinct jimction of the granite with the greenstone

and  porphjTv  rocks                         nor  did  I  obsen^e  veins  or  dykes proceeding fi'om  the  granite,
                                          ;

though possibly a longer search might have been more successful.

The general result of the series of phenomena appeared to me to be the indication

of a gradually increasing intensity of metamorohic action in proceeding north or

north-westward in the direction of the general dip of the strata. The granitic

rocks appeared in the position in which the lower beds of the greenstone slate

would natui-ally be found, and there was no distiu-bance of a nature that would

indicate the intrusion of the granite amongst beds previously formed.

It Is quite true that there is dislocation and tractm-e of the beds, both of the

granitic and porphyritic rocks. But a dislocation exactly similar occurs in the
same beds of gi-eenstone slate on the other or eastern flank of Black Comb, where

there is no granite. In both cases this dislocation of the beds seems to be produced
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  119

by the wi'apping of hard and rigid strata round the central mass of Black Comb.
This formation alone would necessarily dislocate and fracture the beds of rock as
we now see them.

   It appears therefore that the phenomena observed in the metamorphic and

granitic rocks near Bootle may be accounted for without supposing the granitic

rocks to have been intrusive, or attributing the metamoi-phic action in the slate

rocks to the agency of the gi-anite.

  We may consider Eskdale and Miterdale, taken together, to be a broad synclinal

valley formed of the beds of the greenstone slate formation ; that the beds now
formmg the lower or central portion of that valley were the lowest beds of the series,

and were once covered up by a great thickness of the higher beds of this forma-

tion, such as now form Sea Fell and other neighbom-iug mountains, and were con-
sequently exposed to metamorphic action and converted into granite. The super-

incumbent strata being afterwards denuded, the granite beds appeared on the sm--

face as wo now see them. On this explanation we must, of coiu'se, suppose the anti-

clinal ridge of Black Comb, as well as the sj'nclinal valley of Eskdale and Miterdale,
to have been formed before the metamoq^hic action took place, and that hence the
beds of rock in that ridge, and in tlie other boundaries of Eskdale above the level
of the granite, were not buried sufficiently deep below the former sm-face to be

strongly acted upon by the central heat.

   I may now perhaps ventm-e to ofter a few remarks and reasons in support of the

opinion that there exist no sufficient gi'oimds for separating gi-anites, syenites, and
other crystalline unstratified rocks generally, from the class of metamorphic rocks.

I by no 'means wish to assert that there may not exist in certain localities true

--primeval granite portions of the original and first-formed crust of the earth, or

that granite is not in innumerable instances an intrusive or eruptive rock jm a cer-

tain sense, and within certain limits. It may be impossible to prove the negative of

--the first supposition ; the second is undoubtedly true. But I am not called upon to

dispute either of these suppositions both are compatible with the opinion I am
supporting. For I think it is evident that we cannot suppose granite to exist in a

fluid state underneath solid strata full of cracks, fissures, and fractures, and not
perceive that, as a necessary consequence of its fiuidity merely, the granite must
penetrate and fill these cracks and fissures, and must have broken fragments or

masses imbedded in its substance.

   In this penetration of solid strata by fluid granite, the granite may be perfectly
passive. If true and constantly acting causes can be shown to exist, which must

throw the solid crust of the earth into flexm-es and contortions, and produce frac-

tures, cracks, and fissures, we have an explanation of the whole of the phenomena
without supposing the granite to be in any way an active agent.

   It may be objected that we see fluid lava forced up to high levels andpom-edout
from the sides of volcanos ; and why may not granite at former periods have been
subject to similar volcanic forces? Let us consider what are the necessary con-
ditions of a volcanic eruption of lava. One invariable condition is the presence and

violent liberation of vast volumes of highly compressed vapom's or gases, which
are evidently the active forces which drive up the lava and eject stones and ashes.
Volcanos are situated on deep fissures in the earth's crust, which admit air and
water occasionally to great depths, where, being enclosed by accumulations from

above and gradually and highly heated, their elastic tension at last is sufficient

to force up fluid lava with which they may be in contact, or to blow out the
obstructing materials which confine them in the shape of an ei-uption of stones and

ashes.

   But all these phenomena are local, and limited in extent ; the elastic vapours

cannot act explosively imless they are entu'ely enclosed within the walls of solid

strata, which afford the necessary resistance, and act indeed in the same manner as

the sides of a closed vessel woidd do. There is no evidence accordingly that vol-
canic vents pierce so deep as the seas of fluid granite which lie entirely rmder the

solid crust of the earth. And if elastic vapoui-s do exist in these subterranean oceans

of fluid rock, as no confining walls can there exist, their pressure will be distributed

equally in all directions and over large spaces, and there will be no tendency to

force up fluid rock in one place rather than another. There is then, I think, a clear

 distinction bctM-een the intrusion of gi-anite veins into surrounding rocks, produced
 merely by the weight of the superincumbent solid rocks forcing the pranite into
 whatever cracks and fissiu-es exist in them, and the forcible ejection of lava from

 Tolcanos.

  --If it shoidd be conceded that there is no evidence that granites are eruptive rocks,

 except passively as I have described that there is no reason to attribute to them
 any active energy or force in elevating strata or raising mountain-chains, for the
production of which effects we see other quite distinct and sufficient causes at work,
it only remains to inquire whether there is any reason to doubt the sufficiency of
 the nietamorphic action of heat, pressure, and moisture, followed by slow cooling,
to produce granites and syenites, as well as gneiss, quartz, and mica-schist, out of

--sedimentary rocks ; whether granites, speaking generally and on a broad scale, are

not tiiie metamoi-j^hic rocks in situ in their natural position as regards other strata.
    For a reply to this inquiry, I woidd confidently appeal to the gi'eat strides lately

made in the geology of primitive districts, such as the whole of the north of Scot-
laud, in proving that the strata imtil latelj' of unlmovm origin, in vast districts, ai'e,
as proved by Sir R. Murchison, om* old acquaintance, the sedimentary rocks of the
Silurian system in a inetamoi'jjhic state. And when we see these nietamorphic
rocks running by insensible gradation in a thousand ways into granites, and inex-
tricably mixed up ^^^tll them, the positive evidence is strong indeed that the

origin of all these rocks is similar ; and I think there is no negative evidence against

this supposition. On the contrary, I think the remarkable progxess maldug in the

study of the formation of minerals and rocks imder the joint influence of heat, pres-
sm-e, and moistiu'c, followed by slow cooling, the true nietamoi-phic condition, is all
favoiu-able to the position that gi-anites and all similar crystalline rocks are
generally to be classed as the last term of metamorjihism.

   I am fully sensible that the slight amount of subject-matter of observation, or

details of evidence contained in such a paper fts this, make it of little more value

--than as a sort of pioneer in the field of inquiry the suggestion of conclusions

which can only be verified or disproved by evidence of varied character, and by
much more extensive observations than I have been able to adduce. I shall be

satisfied if it may in any way contribute to more valuable and conclusive investi-

gation.

 --Post-glacial deposits. These are evidently of later age than those inland deposits

such as at Leeds and Oxford, for no trace of the Elephant has been found. The

only mammalian remains discovered, in addition to those now living in the neigh-

bourhood, belong to Bos primigeiiius, Bos longifron?, and Cervus elaphus. Skulls,

horns, and bones of these animals have been found in silt, associated with several

submarine forest beds, which occur at various depths in different places in the neigh-

Abourhood.  section at the North Docks shows a submarine forest bed resting on

the rock, at the depth of -35 feet below the high-water level of a 20-feet spring tide.

A section beneath the Custom-house shows a similar bed with the tnmks of trees
A29 feet, and another 40 feet, below a tide of the same height.
                                                                 section across

Wallasey Pool exhibits an old forest bed with remains of trees 39 feet below a

similar tide. The sections were all seen during the construction of the docks. The

Cheshire coast at Leasowe presents phenomena of the same kind, but with less ap-

parent subsidence, being 3 feet at Leasowe Castle, and 8 feet at Dove Point. At

the latter place there are two higher land sm-faces divided by beds of silt.

From these sections the author concluded that a subsidence of the land of nearly

50 feet was indicated, and that it was uniform over its whole extent, a conclusion

confirmed by observations in other places on the same coast. The differences in the

amount of the depression shown by the several sections merely indicate the vary-

ing elevation of the original surface. The subsidence of the lowest submarine

forests probably caused a considerable extension of the river Mersey about the time

of the occupation of Great Britaiu by the Romans. The sinking of the old forest beds

of Leasowe, Dove Point, and Formby is known to be within the historical period.

On a Dinosaurian Reptile (Scelidosaurus Harrison!) from the Lower Lias of
             Charmouth. By Professor Owen, M.D., F.B.S., F.G.S.

   The author said that the reptile of which he was about to speak belonged to the

remarkable order exhibiting modifications of the reptilian structure as we now
122 REPORT 1861.

know it in crocodiles and lizards, as adapted for life on land. The evidences as to
the order Dinosauria were first made known by the discoveries of Mantell and
Biickland, from examples found in this country. The remains had been foimd in

the upper preensand deposits of our cretaceous system, through the Wealden,
and (as regrarded the Megalosam-us) as far down as the great oolitic system ; but
until very recentlv that was the oldest formation from which any evidence of a
Dinosaiuian reptile had been the property of science. Mr. Harrison, a retired
medical gentleman residing at ChaiTnouth on the Dorset coast, near the maami-
ficent liassic clilis that had alTorded such rich evidences of marine reptUia. liad
devoted his leisure to the collection of fossil reniiiins from those clift's. About
three years ago, !Mr. Harrison obtained, from a part of the cliti' which was an upper
member, if not the uppermost, of the Lower Lias, some fragments of limb-boues of
so novel a character that he sent them to him (Professor Owen) for his opinion.

He was surprised to receive such specimens from that locality and formation, seeing

that the fragment.s presented unequivocal evidence of the Dinosaiuian order, and of a
species which, judjnug from the femur, was closely allied to the Iguanodou. Mr.
Harrison was quickened in his researches by receiving a reply to this effect ; he
offered rewards to the quarrpuen, and at length he became possessed of the most
complete skeleton of a Dinosaurian reptile ever obtained from any formation or

--locality. Fortuuat-ely it was almost complete as regarded the skull and dentition
   a part of the osteology of the order which it was most desirous to know. Pre-
ceding inquiries hatl onlv made us acquainted with the lower jaw of the Igtianodon,
part of the lower jaw of the Megalosiiurus and Hvlteosaurus, together with some
email obscure fragments of the upper jaw of the Iguanodon. As to the cranium,
our knowledge was a blank until this happy discovery. The skull was entire, with
the exception of the end of the snout ; in fact, it was entire for all the purposes of
the comparative anatomist. So were the neck and trimk vertebrte, the sacrum, the
Selvis, and a great porrion of the vertebne of the tail. The author described in

  etaU the various portions of the skeleton, pointing out where they nearly re-
semble those of the Iguanodon and the Megalosaurus. These descriptions, with
illustrations, would appear in the forthcoming volume of the Paljeontographical

Society,

into space to find their existing analogues," and that '· in passing from the more
recent to the older strata, we soon obtain indications of extensive changes in the
relative position of laud and sea," cited some striking examples in proof of these
propositions from the reptilian class. The Mosjisaurus of tne cretaceous series
occurs in that series in England, Germany, and the United States. The Poh-pty-
chodon occurs in the same .series at Maidstone and at Moscow. Toothless Lacertian

reptiles have left their remains in ti-iassic deposits at Elgin, in Shropshire, and at
the Cape of Good Hope. Dic\-nodont reptiles occur in the same formation at the
Cape and in Bengal. The I'lesiosaurus, with a more extensive geological range
through the Jurassic or oolitic series, has left representatives of its genus in those
mesozoic strata in England and at her antipodes. Evidence of this extreme of

geographical range had been submitted to ProlVssor Owen by Mr. J. H. Hood, of
Sydney, New South "Wales, obtained by him from the Middle Island of New Zea-

land. This evidence consisted of two vertebi-al bodies or centrums, ribs, and
portions of the two coracoids of the same individual, all in the usual petrified con-
dition of oolitic fossils. Their matrix was a bluish-grey clav-stone, effervescing
with acid ; the largest mass contained impressions of parts of the arch and of the
transverse processes of nine dorsal vertebrie, and of ten ribs of the rig'ht side.
Portions of five of the right diapophyses aud of six of the ribs remained in this
Inatrix. The bones had a ferruginous tint, contrasting with the ruatrix, as is
commonly the case with specimens imbedded in the Oxfordian or liassic clays.
The impression of the first diapophysis and of its rib show the latter to have been

articulated 'by a simple head to its extremity, aa in the Plesiosaurus ; but the

succeeding' rib had been pushed a little behind' the end of its diapophysis, and the

same kiud of dislocation had placed the five following ribs -svith theu- articvUai- ends

opposite the interspaces of their diapophyses. The niuth rib had nearly resumed

its proper position opposite the end of t^je diapophysis, but at some distance from

it ; the impression of the tenth rib sliows the normal relative position of the plem--

aud diapophyses. The ribs are solid, of compact texture, cylindrical, sbghtly

curved, the fragments looking more like coprolites than bone ; they are about an

inch in diameter, with but small intervals ot, say, one-third of an inch, sliglitly ex-

panding as they recede from the ti-ansverse process, and slightly contracting to the

lower end. The first, terminating in an obtuse end of i an inch diameter, is 7 inches

long ; the second is 8 inches long ; the third is 8 J inches ; the fourth rib is 9 inches

long. The extremities of the others are broken off with the matrix. The sepa-

rated fossils sent from New Zealand included the mesial coadjusted ends of a pair

of long and broad bones, thiclcest where they were united, and becoming thinner

a-s they extended outwards, and also towards the fore and hind parts of the bone,

both of which ends were broken away. On one side the surface of the bone is
convex lengthwise, and slightly conca\c transversely. On the opposite side the

contour imdulates lengthwise, the siuface being concave, then rising to a convexity,

where a protuberance has been fomiod by part of the coadjusted mesial mai-gius of

Athe bone; transversely this siufaco is slightly concave.  similar but less deve-

loped median prominence is seen at the midiUe of the medially imited margins of

tlie coracoids in tlie rksiosaunis H(nchinsii, and the author regards the above-

described parts of the New Zealand fossils as being homologous bones. But a more

decided evidence of the Plesiosaurian nature of this antipodeal fossil is afforded by

the vertebral centrums. They have flat articular ends, with two large and two

small venous foramiua beneath. Tlie nemapophysial surfaces, showing the per-

sistent independence of the nem-al arch, are separated from the costal sui-fixces by

about half the diameter of the latter. These are of a fidl oval figui-e, 1 inch 3 lines

in vertical, and 1 inch in fore-and-aft diameter. On one side of one of the ceutnims

--the rib has coalesced with the costal sm-face. The following are the dimensions of

this centrum : Length 1 inch 9 lines, depth 2 inches 2 lines, breadth of articular

end 3 inches G lines. The non-articidar part of the centrum oiiers a fine silky

character. The shape and mode of articidation of the cervical and dorsal ribs, the

shape and proportions of the coracoids concm- with the more decisive evidence of

Newthe vertebr.'B in attesting the Plesiosauroid character of these  Zealand fossils,

and, pending the discovery of the teeth, the author provisionally referred them to

a species for which he proposed the name of Flcsiosaiirus Amtndis. The specimens

had been presented by Mr. Hood to the Biitish Museum.

On certain Markings in Sandstones. By W. Patteeson.

          On a nexu Bone-cave at Brixham. B>j W. Pengellt, F.G.S.

   This cavern (a second new one) was discovered in March last ; it is rich in fossil
bones ; and the district in which it exists has become famous in connexion with
these caverns. The town of Brixham occupies a vaUey running nearly east and
west, which is separated from Torbay on the north by a limestone hill, knowii as
Furzeham Conmron, 150 feet above the sea, while the southern bouudaiy consists

of four hills forming a chain parallel to that on the north, but extending a mile

fru-ther eastward, where it terminates in BeiTy Head, the southern hom of Torbay.

In Windmill Hill, the second (fi-om the west) of the fom-, the celebrated cavern
was discovered in 1858 ; and in the thfrd is the weU-lmo^vn Ash Hole. After a ces-
sation of upwards of twentj- yeai-s, quanying operations had been partially resumed
at Bench, on the Torbay si ope' of Fm-zeham Hill ; and these led to the discovery of the

new cave. The quaiTyis being worked at right angles to the coast-line. Near

the top of the west or back wall, and near the angle formed by the jimction with
the south wall, there is a dyke of breccia, made up of bones, reddish clayey earth,
and angidar pieces of limes'tone, evidently from the adjoining rock. The earth is
precisely similar to that in which the bones are foimd imbedded in the other Torbay
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

caverns. The base of the breccia is on the same level as the bone-bed in the Wind-

mill Hill Cavern ; and there can be no doubt it filled, either wholly or partly, a

north and south fissure. Nearly the whole of the dyke was revealed during the'old

quaiTying operations. In the exposed face there were visible several 'fine bones

but even a remarkably fine left ramus of a lower j aw bristling with, teeth, of the Cave

Hjiena, not only did not atti-act the attention of the workmen at the time, but it

remained unobserved for twenty-two years. Soon after quanying was resumed, in

March last, the removal of the remnant of the outer wall caused a portion of the dyke

to fall. Numerous bones were now so conspicuous amongst the earth and stones,

that the principal workmen soon collected several hundreds, consisting of teeth, jaws,

skulls, vertebrae, and poi-tious of horns, vrith a large qiiantity of unidentifiable bone-

debris. There is no probability that the so-called dyke formed originally portion of

a mass filling a cavern, great part of which was destroyed by the workmen twenty

years ago, for in the neighbourhood it was known that cave bones would fetch good

prices. In fact, the handwriting of the departed limestone was -y-isible on the breccia

sheet that had been so long exposed. Near the southern foot of the dj'ke is the

mouth of a small tunnel, with a stalagmitic floor ; its extent is not known. In the

southern wall of the quany are two large chambers, filled with the reddish earth

and limestone debris ; they are known to be connected, but it is not known whe-

ther they comnmnicate with the tunjiel ; it is exceedingly probable, however, that

they are aU parts of one considerable cavern. All the materials of the dyke im-

doubtedly fell, or were washed in from above                                                                                                                                                                         giving a good example of what pro-

bably occurred at Orestone, near Plymouth, where observed phenomena compel the

belief that the fossil bones must in this way have found ingress to the cavern,

though lines of fissure are not always very distinct there. The owner had now

decided to explore the chambers and timnel himself; but although he had declined

to sell the right so to do, he had always given the author access, had promised to

enable him to note eveiy fact discovered, and he had also lent the exhibited speci-

mens. There is a gxeat field for exploration at Brixham. It is to be hoped that

quarrymen may not in futm-e be so blind to their own interests as to lay open a

dyke of osseous breccia without discovering that they have done so ; and that a

proprietor will not, as in a case within the author's knowledge, admit that he had

filled up a cavern, which he called "a large hole in the rock," by "throwing

twenty cai-tloads of mbbish into it."

                               By W. Pengelly, F.G.S.

   Hard Devonian limestones, fissile and jointed, formed, the author said, the two
projecting homs of Torbaj'. Sandstones and conglomerates foi-m the hollow of the
bay, and have been much worn away within the memoiy of man, especially at
Livermead, which is only preseiTed by continual engineering labour. The process
of erosion by the sea was explained by the author as something IDie a succession of
honej'combing, sometimes by insulation of portions of the cliffs. On the slates and
limestones the sea more slowly produced excavations, which storms enlarge. The
effects of the severe storm of October 1859 on the clifls, beach, roads, &c. of Torbay

were described in detail, and the importance of such storms as modem agents of

change was dwelt upon.

    In a paper on the Chronological and Geographical Distribution of the Devonian
Fossils of Devon and Cornwall*, read before this Section last year at Oxford, I
expressed the pro-visional opinion that there was not sufficient evidence to war-
rant the chi'onological separation of the Petherwin and Barnstaple beds. More

recently I have reconsidered the question, and have foimd reasons for changing my

opinion.

one are common to both: hence twelve are peculiar to the first, and thirteen to the

last area.

   The forty-six genera may be divided into two groups : namely, Ist, those charac-
terized by a considerable maxunum specific variety or development before or after

Petherwin and Barnstaple times ; and 2nd, those that are not thus distinguished.

The first of these groups (which alone we have to consider here) contains thirty-

one genera, of which six may be said to belong to the past, and twenty-five to the

future ; the age of Pethei-win and Barnstaple being the chronological stand-point.
   The " futm'e " division (the only one sufficiently nmnerous to be of service in

this inquiry) consists of two series : namely, 1st, those genera which are equally

represented  in  the two sets  of  beds                      and, 2nd, those that  are not,  -Evidently the

latter series alone can supply information on tlie present question. It is made up

of the fifteen genera named in the following Table, in which the columns headed

the Petherwin, Barnstaple, and British Carboniferous beds respectively.

and even the Petherwin beds, than with the Carboniferous ; hence they may be

considered as belonging rather to the last than to the Devonian series, or possibly

they may have to be regai-ded as "Passage beds " between them.

      On the Age of the Granites of Dartmoor. By "W. Pengelly, F.Q.S.

   It has long been well known that the Dartmoor granites have sent veins into
the cidmiferoiis rocks of North and Central Devon, and that the latter are much

bent and contorted, probably by the intrusion of the former*; consequently the

granites are more modem than the rocks they have thus invaded and disturbed.

    Geologists, however, are by no means agTeed respecting the age of the granites

relatively to that of the deposits of the coimty more modem than the culmiferous
beds. Sir H. De la Beche regards them as more ancient than the red conglomerates

and sandstones of South Devon, but says, " The evidence is not always so clear as
could be desired ; for among all the pebbles of the red conglomerate extending from
Torbay to Exeter, we have not been able to detect any portion of it, though the

granite ranges so near that part of the red conglomerate. In the tongaie of red

sandstone and conglomerate which runs from Crediton by North Tawton and Samp-
ford Courtney to Jacobstow, we have, however, detected pebbles like some varieties
of Dartmoor granite f." This is certainly not a very pronounced opinion in favour
of this evidence ; in another place, however, he speaks somewhat more decidedly

in fovour of the pebbles J ; but he appears to base his chronological opinion mainly
on the fact that the red sandstone series ai'e foimd resting quietly on the basset

edges of the upturned cidmiferous beds§.

   Mr. Godwin-Austen, however, is of a different opinion. " As no granite pebbles,"
he says, " have been found among the various materials of which the new red con-
glomerate is composed, we may conclude that at the period of its accumulation the
granite of Dartmoor coidd not have been exposed, particularly when we bear in mind
that the two formations are at present separated only by the valley of the Teigii.

   " The beds of the Greensand of the Haldous and the Bovey Valley, in the thin
mica, sharp quartzose crystals and seams of felspar, suggest that they may have re-

sulted from a decomposed granite district ; but here, again, although fragments of

all the older rocks occur in the conglomerate beds at the base of the Greensand,

granitic pebbles are altogether wanting ; nor do we meet with them until we anive,

in ascending order, at those superficial accumidations which cap the ITaldons. Pos-

sibly, then, the rise of the gi'.anite of Dartmoor in its present form may belong to a
period comparatively modem ||".

   Happening a few years ago to be at North Tawton, I mentioned the subject to

Wm.Mr. Vicaiy, then resident there, who at once took me to the conglomerate,

and in a very few minutes extracted two or three pebbles, which we both regarded
as of Dartmoor derivation. Whether they were strictly granite in the technical
sense of the word may possibly be questioned ; and it is certain that much of the

granitic mass of Dartmoor will not pass muster as true granite^ ; but that the pebbles
foiuid at North Tawton were of Dartmoor extraction, and can be matched bythousands
in the rivulets and torrent-com-ses of the Moor, I have no manner of doubt.

   In August 1861 I met Mr, Vicary at Exeter, where he now resides, and again
spoke of the Tawton pebbles. He infonned me that he had found unmistakeable gi'a-

nite pebbles in the red conglomerate at the base of Ilaldon, a well-known hill about

five miles south of Exeter. He also iufomied me that since his discovery his

attention liad been called to the fact that Mr. Brice, in his 'History of Exeter,'

mentions the occuiTence of pebbles of granite in the red conglomerate at Haldon**.

  We at once started for the spot, and passing through Alphiugton and Kennford,

and leaving the great road from Exeter to Plymouth, on the right, for that which
passes over Haldon, in a more easterly direction, to Newton Bushel, reached om*
groimd about five miles and a half from Exeter. Mr. Vicary at once pointed out
in the red conglomerate one or two well-marked fragments of the true Dartmoor
series of rocks, but so far disintegrated that it was impossible to extract them in
their integrity ; a farther search was soon rewarded with several less perishable
specimens, and amongst them representatives of each of the three kinds of granite
described by Mr. Godwin-Austen as occmTing on Dartmoor : there were samples of

schorlaceous granite, porphyritic granite, and olvan*. On om* way back to Exeter
we detected several well-marked specimens near Peamore, about two miles and a

half from the city.

   Though granite pebbles may not have been met with in the conglomerates and

sandstones of Torbay, it by no means follows that these rocks are destitute of Dart-

moor detritus. Every one who has paid attention to these sandstones must be well

--aware that in many cases they are eminently micaceous doubtless a result of the

destruction of a large amoimt of pre-existing rock, such as granite, of which mica
was a constituent. Nor is it difficult to understand that whilst boulders and pebbles

might be unable to force a passage to what is now the South Devon seaboard, com-

paratively small thin flakes of mica might succeed in accomplishing the journey.

We may have here an indication that the direction of the prevailing and powerful

--currents was not eastward, but north-east and northerly not from Dartmoor to the

coast of South Devon, but towards Haldon and North Tawton.
   The gTanites of Dartmoor, then, are limited in age, on the side of antiquity by the

culmiferous beds of Devon, and on tlie modern side by the red conglomerates
what is the place of these in the chronological scheme of the geologist ? The answer
has long been given respecting the first : " The upper division of the culmiferous
beds contains fossils identical with those in the upper division of the coal-measuresf."
But the age of the conglomerates is less easily determined. That they belong to the

New Red Sandstone there can be no doubt, since they are above the Upper Coal-
measures and midcrlie the Lias ; but whether Upper or Lower New Red, tliat is, Tri-

assic or Permian, is not so certain as could be wished. They are entirely destitute of
fossils, excepting such only as occm- in the pebbles. The sandstones are evidently

of littoral origin ; their surfaces frequently display fossil sea-ripples, sun-cracks, and
impressions of rain-drops ; but no footprints or organic traces have ever been detected
on them ; there are no palseontological indications of their age.

   More than one eminent geologist has been struck by the angular character of
the fragments composing the conglomerates (more correctly breccias), and has
remai'ked that, in its pliysical character and general appearance, the formation is
rather Peimian than Triassic. It is, as is well known, coloiu-ed in our geological
maps aa on the horizon of the Lower Trias. The granite pebbles of Haldon may

perhaps go far to confirm this decision.

   Whatever may be our opinions respecting the origin of gi-anite, whether we hold

it to be a strictly igneous or a thermo-aqueous product, an original or a SUperim-
5>osed phase of rock existence, there is probably no doubt that it was formed in
 ^lutonic depths, a hypogeuo formation requiring enormous pressure for its elabo-

ration.

   Mr. Sorby estimates the pressure under which the St. Austel granite was formed

as equivalent to that of 32,400 feet of rock %. He gives no estimate for Dartmoor,
but we shall probably not exceed the truth in taking this, his lowest Cornish estimate,

which gives us a pressure equivalent to that of a pile of rock six nules in thickness
but as the pressm'e was probably due to the expanding power of some agency acting

beneath or within the granitized mass, requiring resistance and not pressure,

strength and not weight in the overlying crust, we may content ourselves with a

small fraction of this. Still there must have been a crust of very great thickness at
and after the close of the Carboniferous period, or the granitic form could not have
been assumed by the mass beneath ; and this crust must have been stripped off and

the granite laid bare before the era of the accumulation of the red conglomerates, or

no pebble could have found its way to Haldon. Even if some paroxysm be supposed

to have uplifted the gi-anite in a solid state, so as to shiver the overlying- crust and
thereby to facilitate the work of denudation, still the time required, even thus, appears
to be so very great, so completely overwhelming, so entirely incapable of compres-
sion, that it is impossible to regard the red conglomerate as belonging to the Per-
mian formation, the representative of the period next succeeding the Carboniferous.

Indeed if we conceive of the Dartmoor gTanite being called into existence, as such,

at or subsequent to the close of the Carboniferous period, and laid bare prior to the
era of the Lower Trias, and that, during the interim, a pile of rocks of considerable

thickness, covering an area of 200 square miles, had been stripped off, we get a rough

yet oveiii\'helming measure of the chronological interval, the Permian period.
   The facts of the case appear to require the belief
   1st. That the Dartmoor granite is not older, at most, than the close of the Car-

boniferous period.

   2nd. That it was exposed at the earth's smface when the materials of the red

conglomerate were being accumidated.
   3rd. That the conglomerates are not of higher antiquity than the Lower Trias.
   4th. That the Permian period was one of gi-eat dm-ation.

       On the Gold of North Wales. By T. A. Readwin, F.G.S.

The author confined his obser^·ations in this paper to an area of about twenty square

miles, situated north of the turnpike road leading from Dolgelly to Barmouth.

Professor Ramsay has ably described the geology of this disti'ict in a communica-
tion to the Geological Society of London in 1854, entitled " The Geology of the
Gold-bearing Districts of Merionethshire." The Dolgelly district is bounded by

the river Mawddach, the great Merioneth anticlinal range, and the little river
Camlan. In this district are found the Cambrians, overlaid by the Lower Silurian

Lingular. The Cambrian rocks are coarse greenish-gi-ey grits, and the Lingula-flags

are .arenaceous slatj' beds, intersti-atilied with com-ses of s.andstone. Calcareous
and greenstone dyke's frequently penetrate both the Cambrian and the Silurian rocks.

The metalliferoi{s products are chiefly argentiferous galena, copper pn'ites, blende,

manganese, and mimdic, associated fi-equently with gold. According to Sir R.

Mmchison, " the most usual position of gold is in quartzose veinstones that traverse

altered palaeozoic slates, frequently near their junction with eruptive rocks, whether

of igneous or of aqueous origin. The sh-atified rocks of the highest antiquity, such

as the oldest gneiss or quartz rocks, have seldom borne gold ; l)ut the sedimentary

accumulations which followed, or the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous (parti-

cidarly the firet of these three), have been the deposits which, in the tracts where

they have undergone a metamorphosis or change of structm-e, by the influence of

igneous agency or other causes, have been the chief sources whence gold has been

derived." After refen-ing to the opinion of Professor Ramsay that gold in the Ural

Mountains, Australia, &c. occurred in rocks of a similar age and character, the

author stated that Sir R. Murchison's statement is sing-ularly coiToborated by the

position of the quartzose vein in the Clogaii Mine, distinguished as the " Gold Lode,"

which traverses altered palseozoie slates near the junction of an eruptive bar of

poi-phyritic greenstone ; and the same law appears to obtain also with respect to all

gold-bearing quartzose veins of the Dolgelly district, upon the ores of which he

had made a very large number of experiments during the past eight years. There

are in this disti-ict about twenty localities in which gold has been discovered visible

in quartz, or associated more or less with galena, blende, copper-pj-rites, telluric

bismuth, carbonate of lime, schist, barj-ta, iron-pjTites, &c. By far the richest dis-

coveries of gold have been made at the Dol-y-frwj-nog, Prince of Wales, Cambrian,
and the Clogau mines. Gold has also been found in the " Marine drift " by the

Hon. r.Walpole, Sir Augustus Webster, the author, and others, a piece of which was

exhibited. Mr. Arthur Dean, in a paper read before the British Association in 1844,

stated that a complete system of auriferous veins exists throughout the whole of

the Snowdonian or Lower Silmian formations of North Wales. Upon the feith of

this, much money was spent at the Cwmheisian mines, and very little gold obtained
by smelting operations, for reasons which are now not very difficult to understand.
Much money was also spent about ten years afterwards at the same place, after

settinf the most eminent assayers to work, to prove the truth of ilr. Dean's state-

ment, in erecting machinery, which produced even less gold by amalgamation than
the former method. Although it was then held as an axiom that gold always
exists in a metallic state, that mercmy has always an affinity for gold, and therefore,

wherever gold is present in minerals, mercmy will necessai-ily dissolve it, in this

instance, however, it did not prove the case, and the result of operations upon 150

tons came at length to be considered as an enigmatical faUm-e, as the following

extracts from the expeiiments made at the time will show. Here followed a

detailed accoimt of experiment No. 7, made on 4J tons of metalliferous minerals

which were triturated in 42 lbs. of mercmy. Ten poimds of this on distillation gave
A70 grains residual metal, containing 18-4 gTalus ot gold.
                                                            qualitative analysis of

this residual metal gave gold, sUver, lead, bismuth, zinc, arsenic, and also traces of

copper and u"on. The distilled mercmy contained traces only of zinc and arsenic.

It had been proved before the experiment, and also since, that the 4^ tons of mine-
ral contained several ounces of the " Royal metal," but the quicksilver neglected it
for associates of less dignity, though inti-insicaUy of more real utility. This, how-

ever, was not the result expected. At the Dol-y-fi"wynog mine, about two years

aftei-wards, Sh- Charles Price operated similarly upon several tons of material, but

with the same provoking failure as before. At present the Clogau mine is the

most interesting and profitable. It stands at an elevation of 1000 feet above the

level of the sea. The "Saiat Da-vid's" or "Gold Lode" is the most remarkable

feature. After giving some descriptions of this mine, he desired to notice espe-

cially that this lode is at the jmiction of the Cambrian sandstones and theLingida

Aflags of the Lower Silurian rocks.   quantity of what was called " poor copper

ore " was raised from this lode and sold many years since ; but in 1854 the refuse

of this " poor copper ore " was examined, and indications of native gold in con-

siderable quantities were foimd. Some of this refuse ore was put to the test, and

in one instance, to his knowledge, 100 lbs. weight yielded 14^ oimces of gold. Many

other experiments have been made by various persons with equal success ; but

owing to the uncertainty of the operation of amalgamation on the one hand, and

the mines themselves being subject to two Chancery suits on the other, the general

--value of the lode, in bidk, has not imtil recently been determined. After some

observations on the processes of assay which he did not think would give the

--approximate value of amiferous minerals, notwithstanding that the contraiy had been

asserted by many eminent men he refeiTed to a series of thirteen experiments made

by himself last aiitimm upon 112 poimds of amiferous quartz from the Clogau mine,

didy prepared and sampled by Johnson and Son, of Loudon. The whole quantity gave

An25 oz. 16 dwts. 7 grains of amalgam, and of fine gold, 8 oz. 5 dwts. 19 grains.

authority in such matters had declared the value of the gold by assay to be £9 per

cwt., while he declared it to be £30 ; in the latter case samples of 7 lbs. each, instead

of the usual 400 grains, had been operated on. He would now state the result of

actual working operations for gold at the Clogau mine since the beginning of the

year. This statement showed that 207 tons 8 cwt. of quartz gave 1314 oz. of fine

gold ; 3 tons of the best of this quartz gave no less than 976'6 oz. of gold. If
they added 56 oimces obtained from 5 tons in 1860, it showed a total quantity of

1370 ounces of gold from 212 tons of am-iferous mineral, being at the rate of 6^

oimces per ton. This, he believed, was the first instance of a hundi-edweight of

gold having been obtained fi-om the crown lands of this countiy, the value of which
was £5300. This " Eoyal Mine " paid a royalty of Jj to the' crown. The cost of

extraction had been veiy inconsiderable, and there was a probability of an equal

yield of gold for some time to come.

P.S. The total amount raised fi-om this lode to 19th May, 1862, is three hundi-ed-

weight.

examination of the cuttings and tunnels in railroads ; and they had not of late years
derived more information from a single cutting than that to which he would point
their attention. There was a branch railway making from Bristol, from the Great
Western line, and which was to traverse the Severn. In making this traverse, it
was necessary to cross a ridge of limestone near Almondsbury, the railroad cutting
through the carboniferous limestone. In one part strata were subject to very great
contortions. In some parts there were broken bands of coal, thrown about in an
extraordinary way. The whole of the highly inclined strata were sm'mounted by

new red sandstone. It was remarkable that there was in this cutting an enormous
amount of calcareous and other grits which seemed to form a reg-ular part of the
mountain limestone. There were also large red masses, evidently formed by con-

cretion.

   Sir R. Murchison exhibited a detailed diagram prepared by Mr. Richardson,
and, having visited the^locality, explained the chief phenomena to the Section,
gremising that the tract should be examined carefully by one of the Geological

  urveyors.

        On the Nature of Sigillariffi, and on the Bivalve Shells of the Coal.

                          By J. W. Saltek, A.L.8., F.G.S.

   The object of the communication was to describe some specimens of Sigillaria
which have the appearance of having grown in water, inasmuch as they have the
stem swelled at short intervals, and show scars like those of the rootlets of Stig-
maria at these swollen varices. The scars in question appear between the ridges on
which the rows of leaf-scars are arranged, and tenninate where the swelling ceases.
Such swellings are seen in several fine specimens, in the Manchester Museum, of

Sif/. (Fari(hiria) tes.iellata, S. nodosa, and S. hexagona.
   That the Sigillarue gi'ew in water has long been the opinion of Mr. Binney (1840),

and (independently) also of Professor H. Rogers (1842). The tracks of large
worms in the sediment, the spiral annelides {Spirorhis), and the very frequent in-
termixture of undoubted sea-shells, have led the former author to speculate freely

on their growth in sea-water. And the presence of verj' salt water in coal-mines,

and of soda in all coal, as Dr. Percy affii-ms, is a confirmation of this belief.
   The freshwater character of the coal-gi-owths has been assumed chiefly fi'om the

occurrence of shells like Unio in it (Anthracosia of King). These, however, differ
in some important particulars from true Unio, and they are foUnd associated with
shells {Anthracomya) which appear, from their wrinlded epidermis, to be related

to the MyadcE. They occur, too, though much less frequently, with true marine
forms, Prodiictus, Spirifcr, &c., in the ironstones ; and one, the common Anthra-
cosia acuta, is even found in the moimtain limestone shale, where the fossils are all

marine.

   On the Granitic RocJcs of Donegal, and the Minerals associated therewith.
                                   By R. H. Scott, M.A.

   The author gave a short account of a mineralogical tour made by him, in com-
pany with Professor Haughton, in the course of the smnmer, the results of which
seemed to throw some light on the possible origin of granite. The district visited
was Donegal, which county consists mainly of gneiss and mica-slate, and is traversed
in a N.E. direction by an axis of granite. This granite is of a peculiar composition,

--containing two felspars, one orthose, and the other, not albite, as in the granite of

the Mourne mountains, biit oligoclase a mineral whose occurrence in the British
Islands had only been noticed within the last twelve months. Professor Haughton,

to whom this discover}'^ is due, was unfortimately unable to attend the Meeting.

--The facts were briefly these : The granite contains oligoclase and quartz, which

combination appears to be a proof that the rock never was in a melted condition,
as in that case these two minerals woidd have acted on each other and formed com-

mon felspar. It lies in beds corresponding to the general lie of the strata of the

country, and in its character is essentially gneissose ; and, lastly, at points inside
the area of the gi-anite, metamorphic rocks (limestones and slates) are foimd with

                                                                                                     9*

their bedding, -which is nearly vei-tical, unchanged. The condition of theise rocks is

very similar to that of the same rocks outside the granite area ; and it is a point of

great interest to determine how they got there. The solution of this offered by the

author of the pajier was that the whole of the rocks had been originally stratified,

and had been subjected to some actions which are termed metamoi-phic. ' The result

of such action was to convert some into granite, some into gneiss, and some into cry-

stalline limestone and mica-schist, withoutverymuch altering their relative positions.

The possibility of granite being produced by other means than simple heat seemed to

them to be proved by the occurrence of felspar in quartz veins, which are usually

admitted to have been filled by means of infiltration. The author stated that there

were several points in connexion with these granites which showed a close relation

between them and the granites of Norway. The whole question required a careful

chemical and mineralogical examination, which could not be concluded for some

time. Among the types of rock found in Donegal is a syenite, the felspar of which

is oligoclase. The origin of this rock the authors are disposed to attribute to the
Aaddition of limestone to the granite.
                                                                          similar syenite occm-s at Carlingford, but

contains anorthite, a felspai- which would residt from the admixture of a larger

quantity of limestone than is necessary to produce oligoclase, and has been proved

by Professor Haughton to have such an origin. The anorthite syenite never occurs

unless limestone is present in large excess, which is not the case in Donegal. In

conclusion, Mr. Scott mentioned that the district described by him was very rich in

minerals, some of which were extremely riire, and that he entertained no doubt that

a more careful examination would largely increase their number.

        On the Elswortli Rod-, and the Clay above it. By Haret Seelet.

The Elsworth rock is a limestone somewhat oolitic and pjTitous, divided by a

dark clay into upper and lower beds characterized by different fossils. At the vil-
lage of illswoi-th the entire thickness is not more than 14 feet, a thickness which a

well-sinking three miles S.S.W. showed it still to retain. The dip bein"' in this

direction, and of about 1 foot in 200, it followed that another stone band foimd at

St. Ives, 4^ miles north, would be 130 feet lower do^^^l. This rock, at a point

midway between St. Ives and Elsworth, was found in a well to be some 5 feet thick ·

at St. Ives what remains of it is rather thicker. It is more earthy than the Els-

worth beds, has similar fossils, and is often divided b}' a thin parting of clav. At

Bluntisham, two miles N.N.E. of St. Ives, the Elsworth rock is again met with

the St. Ives rock therefore coming up in a saddle. Another rock is found at St.

Neots. As the St. Ives rock occurs at Papworth, little more than two miles west

of Elsworth, and St. Neots is six miles west of Papworth, this stone band is re-
Agarded as gi'eatly below the other beds.
                                                                          similar conclusion would be dra^v^l

from the fossils of the adjacent clay. At Tetwoiih, seven miles S.W. of Elsworth

and therefore above the Elsworth rock, a thin limestone of a foot and a half was

found.

These rocks mark zones in the clay all distinguished bj- difii^ring groups of fossils

the St. Ives zone A. Evgenii, A. Maria, A. cordatm, A. Goliathiis, Sec. ; in the next

zone are A. Baheanus and A.  alternans                                    and in the Tetworth zone A. Achilles, Be-
                                                                       ;

lemnitcs crcentricus, Lima j)ecfinifonnis, Grypha:a dilatata, Ostrea deltoidea, &c.

Above this latter zone no stone bands are known, there being a great thickness of

clay which appears to pass gi'adually into the Kimmeridge clay, the coral rag beino-

wanting. But as there is not the iLsual break in life, but a blending of the fossils

of two clays hitherto distinct, and with them some fonns of the coral rao-, the
coral rag was still present as a period, though under a new fomi. Provisionally

this stratum is called the Tetworth clay*. The Elsworth rock is at its base · ite
upper limit is unknown ; in it are very few new and peculiar forms.

The Elsworth ror-k abounds in fossils, a careful examination of which showed it

to bo rather the up[)ermost part, of the Oxford clay than a representative of the
A Am-calcareous giit at the base of the Tetworth clay.

--Alluvial Deposits. The first point we remark is the gi-eat difference which at

present occurs in the deposition of silt and alliiviiim by such rivers as the Severn

and Avon, compared with swift-flowing streams like the Wye and Usk, which have

a fall of as much as 2^ feet in a mile along their general coiu-se. In some localities

Wyethe has shifted its course, filled up its former channel, and cut out a new bed,

within' the memory of man, as proved by an old map, which gives the position of

the celebrated Ross Oak, now knowTi as the "Burnt Oak," and the river aa it
Aflowed a centiu-y and a half ago.
                                     broad surface of meadow-land now sweeps

where the Wye then flowed, and the river now runs some 70 or 80 yards from the

former bank on which that old oak stood. This is not the case with respect to the
smoothly flo-wing Severn and sluggish Avon to anything like the same extent.

   The point, however, to which the author woidd direct attention is, that all these
rivers may and do alter theu" courses, and destroy and re-form their alluvia over and

over again, for age after age, \%-ithout in the slightest degi-ee changing their courses,

save as regards the level alluvial land.

  --Tlie Lake Period. It is well known that there was a time, antecedent to the

present configuration of land and river sm-face, when the Severn, Avon, and Wj-e

flowed, as the river Shannon does now, through a chain of lakes of various sizes,

and which lakes are now silted up and fomi the celebrated " holmes " or river-
meadows. The author formerly inferred that the relics of the gTcat quadrupeds

found so abundantly on the banks of the Avon, at Bricklehampton and Cropthorne,
at Kempsey and other localities on the Severn, were disinterred from banks of mud,

silt, and gravel, which were formed on the shores of the ancient lakes. It is here
that he woidd coiTect the inferences that might be drawn from any correlation of

these di'ifts, which contain the remains of the hippopotamus, rhinoceros, elephant,
cave-hyfena, and extinct oxen and deer, with the deposits of the Lahe-epoch. They

--belong to a distinct qwch, and ofter a distinct history.
   Low-level Drift. Mv. Prestwich has sho^^-n that certain drifts and gi'avel
beds above the Avon, Severn, and other rivers, which ho designates as "low-level
drifts," are altogether antecedent to, and independent of, the detritus which fills
up the beds of the fonner lakes. They belong to a distinct epoch, and represent an

entirelj' diflerent water surface. Instead of dipping under or into the lacustiine

deposits, in many localities they dip away fi'om the old lake silts, and are slightly
upheaved. They are, in fact, the relics of broad and, probably, rapid rivers, of which
the fonner channel must have been 30 or 40 feet above the level of the silted-up

lakes.

   The period of the " low-level drift " was, then, anterior to that of the Lake epoch

in this pai't of England ; and it is in these beds, and not in the lacustrine drifts of

Worcestershii-e, that the explorer finds such numerous relics of the extinct mam-

malia.

   These beds are well developed near the Avon at Bricklehampton and Cropthorne,
and near the Severn at Upton-on-Severn, and near the Ox-eye Gate, about a mUe
from Tewkesbury, on the Ledbury high road. Near Worcester they may be seen

in various localities ranging above the margins of the former lakes. These drifts

are also well developed on the banks of the Wye, near Hereford, as at Broomy
Hill and the Infirmary. At Brecon, ^Ir. S3monds found a most interesting old

river-margin of well-stratified sand with rolled pebbles, on the slope of a hill, and

summits of very considerable hills in the vale of Worcester. They occur on Tunnel

Hill at Upton-on-Sevem, on the summit of Corsewood IIUl, on Ryal Hill, Twining

near Tewkesbmy, and at Elmore neai" Gloucester. They are foimd along the flanks

of the Malvems, where they have yielded the remains of Elephas antiquus and

Ithinoceros ticJiorhinus, animals that lived during the glacial period, and are there-
Afore properly associated with the northern di-ift.
                                                     fine molar tooth of Mephas

antiquus has lately been foimd by Hemy Brooks among the gi-avel which overlies

the gi-eat masses of angular blocks heaped against the side of a hill, known as

Clincher's IMill Wood, near Ledbury.

The author also observed the high-level drift at several points in Herefordshhe,

the principal of which is an excellent section, near the Kite's Nest, on the Hay

road, about four mUes west of Hereford, and a still better one at Wilcroft near Lug-

wardine. Another fine molar of E. primigenius has been brought to the author of

the paper since it was read at Manchester. This fossU is from the high-level diift,

75 teet above the Severn, and is from Twining gi-avel-pits between Tewkesbiuy

and Brockeridge Common on the Worcester road.

     On Suhten'anean Movements. By Professor VAUGnAN, of Cincinnati.

   The author stated that the definite relations recently discovered between calorific
and mechanical action seemed to have an important bearing on questions relating
to the secular refrigeration of the earth and the high temperatm-e of its internal
regions, even at the present time. The vast amount of heat supposed to have
escaped from our planet dming past ages might be reasonably expected to call into
existence forces of much greater efficiency than those indicated by the upheaval of
lands, or by the violence of earthquakes and mechanical eruptions. Our terrestrial
fabric had a strength too limited for the full development of such great calorific
powers by the unequal contractions of its diflerent parts ; and in a cooling globe com-
poimd gases could not be expected to produce any decided mechanical effect, at

least without materially altering the composition of the atmosphere. But, apai-t
fr-om these causes, the ti-ansition of the igneous rocks from a fluid to a solid state

would be attended with occasional paroxysmal movement and change. Being de-
pendent on hydi'ostatic conditions for stabilitj', the diS'erent pai-ts of the earth's
crust must extend into the great reservoir of lava to a depth in some measm-e pro-
portionate to the elevation above its surface. Continents must rest on solid fomi-
dations far deeper than those which supported the bodv of the ocean ; and the
violence which subten-anean forces manifested in several Islands might be ascribed
in part to the weakness of the barriers which restrained them. Inequalities in the
solid envelope of our globe were indicated -with some certainty by lociil forces of
gi'avity. The anomalous character of the vibrations of the pendulum, when applied

m some places, justified the conclusion that the invisible side of the eai-th's crust

contained the greatest in-egularities, and that our continental ti-acts of land rest on
the bases of gigantic subten-anean mountains, whose tops might be depressed even

three or fom- huudi-ed miles below the mean level of the nitrified matter. The
accmnulations of solid matter on the internal mountains must ultimately be crushed
by the strain which their augmented size occasioned ; a mighty avalanche of rock
would then tumble to the thinner part of the eaith's crust. Regarding these masses
as the cause of earthquakes, they might account for the instantaneous manner in
which the shocks of earthquakes occurred, their extreme violence and destructive
character near the coasts of continents and on adjacent islands, while they were
almost imperceptible in the interior of continents. It was probable that the ascend-
ing movements of silica, and perhaps of other isolated matter, might serve to bring

the hea\'y metallic deposits from the central to the supeiiicial regions of our planet,
and the general occm-rence of gold in auriferous quai'tz rock might thus admit of

plausible explanation.

                   On the Burnley Coal-field and its Fossil Contents,

                            Bij J. T. WiLKiNSOBT and J. Whitaker.

   Althougli of limited area, the Burnley coal-field is imcommonlv rich, not onlyin

fossil fuel, but also in organic remains. It comprises within itself a complete series
of the middle and lower coal-measures. It is surroimded by ranges of hills ; the

principal of them being Pendle on the north, Boulsworth on the east, G-orple to-
wards the south, and Hambleton on the west, several of them being nearly 2000 ft.

above the sea-level. Geographically, the field occupies the lowest portion of the

valley ; but, geologically, it is the highest, when considered with reference to the
stratification of the district. The most productive part of the field underlies the
town of Biu'nley, where it assumes the fomi of a long trough, boimded on the east
and west by two faidts, running nearly parallel. The greatest depth to which the

strata has been pierced occurs on the Fuledge estate, near the centre of the basin,

--where a depth of nearly 300 yards has been obtained. There have been found the

following seams : The Dog Hole Mine, or top bed, 6 ft. thick ; Kershaw Mine,
3 ft. ; Burnley Old Five-feet Mine (the main coal of the field), 5 ft. ; Higher Yard

Bed, 3 ft. ; Lower Yard Bed, 3 ft. ; Low Bottom Mine, 4 ft. ; Cannel Bed, 2^- ft.

Thin Coal Mine, 2| ft. ; Great Mine, or Eang Bed, 4 ft. These are locally called-
" The top beds," and they include about 40 ft. of coal, imbedded in strata about
600ft. deep. For a depth of 240 ft. below these no coal occm-s. Then come the
Arley series, or Haberg-ham Alines, consistiug of the following working seams :
China, about 2 ft. thick ; Dandy Bed, 3 ft. ; Arley, or Habergham Mines, 4 ft.
giving a total of 9 ft. of coal to about 445 ft. of intermediate strata. Strata not
contaming coal here again form another awkward division of the measures. The
Gannister Mines follow next, comprising the Foot Mine, with a hard Gannister bed;
the Spa Clough Top Bed, 2^ ft. ; Spa Clough Bottom Bed, 4 ft. ; or a total of 8 ft.
of coal, with 684 ft. of intervening strata. From these measures to the Rough
Rock, the highest part of the Millstone-grit formation, the distance is something
more than 300 ft. Omitting many seams less than 1 ft. thick, there is, from the

formation, a total of 50 ft. of coal, for a depth of 2025 ft. of strata. None of the thin
seams in the IMillstone-gi'it have been worked in the Burnley district. The
authors describe in detail the various seams mentioned, and the fossil remains

foimd in each. In conclusion, they state that seven large specimens of Sigillarice
were found in the limited space occupied by a small cotton-mill recently erected
in Chm-ch Street, Burnley ; and others have been foimd in Mill Lane during the

construction of a common sewer. The whole of these were in an upright position,

and several had Stigmarian roots adhering, giving the best possible evidence that

they had grown and flourished on the spot. The whole of the overlying rock may
be described as an immense fossil forest, occupying the central part of the Bumley
coal-field ; and that town itself is situated on what was one of its richest lagune

jungles, replete with the flora of a former geological age.

              On the Geology of Knockshiyoivna in Tipperary, Ireland.
                               By A. B. WTifira, F.G.S.

   In this paper the position of Ejiockshigowna, a conspicuous object in the Lower
Ormond pai-t of Tipperary, was first alluded to ; and the author proceeded to describe
it as a somewhat ridge-shaped elevation, rising to 701 feet above the level of the
sea, and 400 feet above that of the sm-rounding limestone plain, with a gentle slope
on the south-east and a steep declivity to the north-west. Its structxu-e was then
explained, and it was stated to be formed of Silurian rocks overlaid by the Old Red
Sandstone, which is unconformable to the Silm'ian, and is denuded at the top of the hUl
so as to expose these imderlying rocks. The Old Red is entirely absent along the

gi-eatest part of the north-western base of the ridge, in consequence of the occm*-

rence of a fault, by which it is buried beneath the outcrop of the Silmian rocks. The
position of this faidt is marked out and its existence proved by the near approach
of the Carboniferous limestone and Silurian formations at two points along the
line of fracture, space not being left between them for the thickness of the Old Red

Sandstone as exposed upon the opposite flank of the hill.

   The Siliuiau rocks consist of gi'ey gi'its, slates, shales, flagstones, and coarse con-
glomerates, the latter occurring as a ^-ide interstratilied band, and taking a peculiar
red coloiu- as they approach their junction with the o-\erl}ing, unconformable Old

Red Sandstone. Fossils were stated to have been foimd by the author and W. H,

Bailv, Esq., F.G.S., in these Silurian rocks, and a list of them (by the latter gentle-
man) was given, including two corals, sbc kinds of ti'ilobites, two sorts of grapto-
lites, and twenty-five shells, belonging to the orders called Brachiopoda, Conchifera,

Gasteropoda, and Cephalopoda.

   From the paheontological e^adence aflbrdedTsy these, the rocks which contained
them were supposed by fill'. Baily to belong to the lower Llandovery subdi-\ision.

   i\.fter stating the general similarity of all the rocks of Knockshigowna beneath
the Old lied Sandstone as one group, and their resemblance to other Lower Silurian
rocks in the south of Ireland, the discover}' of the characteristic Cambrian fossil,
Olilhavtia radiata, by J. Darby, Esq., which is believed to have been foimd ifi situ

in these rocks, was incidentally mentioned. And iu conclusion, the Old Red Sand-

stone, carboniferous shale and limestone of the localitj' were each described ; and

the absence of the drift, except in a few places in the ueighboiu-hood, was pointed

out.

On (lie Excess of Water in the Eeyion of the Earth ahout New Zealand
      its Causes and Effects. By J. Yates, M.A., F.B.S., F.G.S.

   The author of this memoir endeavours first to ascertain, from the best authorities,

the proportion of land and water on the smfacc of the globe. He finds that the

estimates vary between 100 land to 256 water, which is Berghaus's last estimate,

and 100 land to 289 water, which is the computation of Professor Link. It is

remarkable that these numbers arc the squares of 10, IG, and 17, and of this cu'Cuui-

stance the author avails himself in his subsequent arithmetical calculations.

Such being the propoi-tion of land to water, the next question is, where to fix

the centre of the water so far as it is now collected on the sm'face of the globe.

On the authority of Berghaus, who laboured with the concurrence and advice of

Iliuuboldt and Bitter, the author assmnes this centre to be 40° S. of the Equator,

and on a meridian which touches upon the islands of New Zealand, although his

conclusions would not be materially aftected, if, following Ansted and some others,

he were to fix the point 5° nearer to the south pole.

For the sake of simplicity and clearness in computation, he supposes all the water

to be collected around its centre in aimifoiTu mass, instead of being distributed and

ramified into oceans, seas, baj's, and straits. Thus a small circle divides the entire

mass of land from the entire mass of water. This circle is delineated on the globe

by taking the centre of the laud and drawing a circle round it with 62° 30' as radius,

this radius being assumed on the supposition that it is safest to take a mean between

the two extreme proporrions of land and water.

In addition to these data respecting the proportions and the centres of the land

and water, the author shows that the mountains in the so-called Land Hemisphere

greatly sm-pass in elevation those of the  Water Hemisphere                                                                              and presuming tJiat
                                                                                                                                      ;

the moimtains in the Water Hemisphere are the highest points of submerged con-

tinents, he uses the mouutaius of the Land Hemisphere as gauges for measuiing the

general depth of the w^ater, which he finds to be nearly two kilometres. · By a

subsequent investigarion he finds the generfil elevation of the continents above the

le^·el of the water to be about one-thu-d of this quantity.

To explain his theor}' the author employs a diagram, which is a section of the

Aearth through the meridian of New Zealand.     diameter is drawn from the centre

of the ocean and is intersected by a perpendicular, which is the chord of the before-

mentioned arc of 125°, and which divides the collected land from the collected

water. By the use of this diagram, and proceeding fr-om one step of mathematical

reasoning to another, having like'wise assumed that the hemisphere of the solid

earth contiguous to the great mass of water is heavier than the other hemisphere,

and that the solid earth has consequently a centi-e of gi-avity lying to the south-

eastward of its centre of magnitude, the author computes the distance between these

two centres to be about 1260 metres. From this apparent fact, coupled with the

general peiinanency of the surface of the teiTaqueous globe, he infers that the inteiior

of the globe must be iu the main solid, and of this he further avails liimself to explain
the phenomena of earthquakes and the so-called " magnetic stomis."

The Chairman (Professor Babington), in opening tlie Meeting, made some re-

marts on the advantages of meetings like those of tliis Association. The great

object of science was the unfolding the laws by which the universe was governed,

and one of the greatest encouragements to this study was the assembling together

of men of kindred minds and similar pursuits. Sometimes ditierence of opinion

engendered feelings of an rmpleasant kind, which personal intercom-se served to re-

move                      and thus these meetings, on accoimt of their scientific and social value, had

       On some Points in the Anatomy o/Cyprsea. By T. Alcock, M.T).

   Examinations of nmuerous specimens of Cypraa, received from the Smithsonian

Institiition, have led me to the conclusion that the oral organ in this genus is a

rostrum, capable, however, of complete retraction. The food found in the stomach
of the animals consists almost entirely of sponge. The teeth differ considerably
from one another in difterent species, but all have the essential characters of those

of the Rostrifera.

   The gills are two in number : one large, semicircidar, and pectinate ; the other
trefoil-shaped and plume-like. The whole roof of the branchial chamber behind
the giUs is occupied by a very large mucus-gland.

  An accoimt is given of this Institution at page 109 of the last volume of ' Trans-

ments in the way of Transatlantic science, it is satisfactory to know that it is only
in pecuniary resources that its operations have received a check. The U.S. Govern-
ment are simply the trustees of the fund, not its owners ; and the stores of scientific
material are equally available for students in all parts of the world. The policy

has been inaugurated of always depositing the first duplicate of tj'pe specimens on

the other side of the Atlantic. The accumulation of a large museum at Washing-

ton is not the object of the Directors, but rather the distribution of the duplicate

materials, wherever it can be shown that they will promote the " increase and dif-

                         On the Variations of Tecturella grandis.
                       By Philip P. Carpenter, B.A., Ph.D.

   Of the score of so-called species of Acmaeidfe described from the Californian coast,
there are seven which are tolerably well established. The species of Actncea, how-
ever, run into each other by so many intermediate forms that their determination
is very difiicult. The amount of -wiiiation of which one species is susceptible is
well shown in Tecturella f/randis, which presents well-marked chai-acters to separate
it from all other species of limpets ; and yet, in about thii-ty specimens examined,

the ratio of the anterior portion in front of the apex to the entire length (generally
a constant quantity in each species) was found to vary from 1 : 7 to 1 : 20. In this,
as in similar cases, the facts should be tested both by the Darwinian theory and by
the theory of specific pennanence. It is not to be expected, in the present state of
our knowledge, that either theory alone will aflbrd a satisfactoiy explanation of all
the facts as they arise.

              On the Anatomy of Ortliagoriscus Mola, the short Sunfish.
                                  By John Cleland, M.D.

    The integTiment of this fish is a dense substance of great thickness, consisting of
 felted fibres, whose meshes are filled with a copious j elly-like matter containing cells.
 There are imbedded in it, on the front of the head and in common with the caudal
 fin rays, hard plates presenting a peculiar sti'ucture, composed of iutercommunicating
 tubes, which contain masses of crystalline matter, and lie in a hyaline matrix.

    The skeleton can only be studied in the recent state, on account of important
 masses of cartilage entering into its structm'e. There are no ribs. The interspinous
 bones of the long and pointed dorsal and anal fins are of great size ; those of the
 caudal fin are crowded oetween the last osseous vertebra and the superior and infe-
 rior spines of the vertebra preceding. Every fin-ray is composed of a pair of osseous
 slips, arising one on each side of a cartilaginous basis. Those of the dorsal as well
 as those of the anal fin are crowded together into a compact mass, which moves
 in a groove on a lai'ge block of cartilage into which the interspinous bones are in-
serted. The caudal fin rays are isolated fi-om one another, each imbedded sepa-
rately in the integument ; their cartilaginous bases are short and thick ; and in a
line with them is a similar cartilage without any fin-ray attached, which is appa-
rently vertebral in its natiu-e, but which is placed, not in direct continuation with
the last osseous vertebra, but on a slightly higher level, reminding one of the
upward tendency exhibited by the last vertebra of most osseous fishes.

    The muscular masses on each side of the body consist entirely, as was pointed out
by Mr. Goodsir, of immensely developed fin-muscles.

   The abdominal cavity lies in immediate contact ·«'ith the integument, there being
only two very small vestiges of abdominal muscles. The vertebral column, there-
fore, is not used as an instrimient of motion, but ouly supports the dorsal and anal

fins, which, together with the short tail, are the organs of progression.

   As was pointed out by Arsaky, the spinal cord of the Simfish is exti-emely short,
and temiinates within the cranial cavity. The spinal canal is occupied bj' a large
Cauda equina. The nerves, after emerging from the spinal ctmal, are joined together

by a commimicating cord and ganglia.

   As if to compensate for the want of muscidar parietes to the abdomen, the intes-
tines have very thick musculai- coats. They are coiled closely together into a mass,
which is tightly invested by a single fold of peritoneimi, and the spaces between the
coils are entii-ely occupied by large lymphatic sinuses.

   There is a marked cu'cidar fold of the mucous membrane a few inches above the
rectmu, which may be considered as a rudimentaiy caecum.

   The heart presents eleven semilunar valves : three protect the entrances of veins
into the auricle ; fom- guard the auriculo-ventricular opening ; and other four, two
of them veiy small, the bulbus arteriosus.

   The ear lias no otoliths, and only two semicii'cular canals. The nostrils are ex-
tremely small. The eye is veiy large.

  A number of other peculiarities, relating to the bones of the head and to the

viscera, were pointed out.

   The mercantile marine of Liverpool, engaged in foreign and colonial trade, amount-

men, exhibits an amount of enterprise such as probably no other age and no other
place has ever before shown. The whoje globe is scoui-ed by these men and ships,

in search of whatever may conduce to civilization and to the wealth of the country
which is the centre of this vast and important combination. Nor is the port of
Liverpool, although the largest (representing one-thu-d of the commerce of Eng-

--Howland), the only one to which a similar remark is applicable ; and it therefore becomes
a question worthy of consideration  is it that such a vast staff of enterprising

men, constantly sailing to all parts of the globe, do so little to add to om* Know-

ledge of the natural productions, which they, of all men, are in the best position to
explore and to provide for the investigations of scieutiiic natm-alists at home P

"VN ny do these men, confining their attention to the immediately useful results of

the trade in which they are engaged, altogether pass by natiu-al objects, the collec-

tion of which coidd not fail to be a source of interest, and which, to men with a

moderate degree of education, would, it might be imagined, aflbrd the stimidus of

a rational pride ? One thing is certain, namely, that no accessions of importance

piece of coral, a shell or two, or something which has received attention from its

oddity, is occasionally brought by the sailor from the rich and interesting regions

which he has visited ; but, as a general rule, auj-thing of value or importance is not

even to be looked for. There are, however, a few, a very few, honom^able excep-

tions, in men whose intelligence leads them to see the value of the opportunities

they enjoy, and to make use of them, as far as in them lies, for the improvement

and advancement of knowledge. But the willingness of these gentlemen to render

then- assistance in any direction in which their scientific friends ashore point out

that they can be usefid, only serves to place in the strongest possible li|fht the

immense value which would accrue to science were a large body of such men, instead

Weof one or two, constantly employing themselves in a similar manner.  cannot

expect all captains of vessels, or, indeed, perhaps any, to use in this direction the

intelligence of a Darwin or a Huxley ; but it is not, perhaps, too much to look for

that they should exercise a moderate degree of interest in the acquisition of rudi-

mentary infonuation, and a certain amoimt of capacity in the selection and collec-

tion of the midtifarious objects which daUy come under their notice. The difficul-

ties which are umformly brought fonvard against the idea of seamen turning their

attention to natural history are chiefly on the score of want of time to attend to

anj'thing except their own business. But those who are best competent to judge

give a diflerent accoimt. They teU us, indeed, that the seaman, dm-ing his passage

through subordinate grades, has his hands full, and his attention fully occupied by

his ship duties. But when he is entrusted with a command, the case is diflerent.

He is no longer a servant on board his vessel, but a master. His life of active

employment is changed for one of comparative idleness, and it is well if the time thus

left on his hands is not put to an evil use. Sailors have not the advantages which

the mechanic enjoys upon shore. None of the ordinary rational modes of spending

his hom's of leism'e are open to him. He is dependent vipon himself for amuse-

Howment, and this is more particularly the case with the captain.  often, unfor-

tunately, do we hear of captains of vessels being charged with intemperance, cruelty,

and the long train of e^'ils resulting from an imoccupied mind, and an absence of

--sufficient emplojTuent for the energies of mind and body. The ship is not alicays

in a gale she does not always require the close supervision which is doubtless often

necessaiy. There are abundant seasons of repose, and ample time which might be

employed in the pm'suit of those rational amusements or studies which woidd be of

so vast a benefit to science. Again, a captain naturally feels that, should he devote

any attention to natural history, he may lay himself open to the charge of neglectr

iug his ship's duties. His owner may possibly be naiTow-minded enough to con-

demn him for allowing anything to occupy his mind besides the routine of his ship

work ; or he may even be shortsighted enough to imagine that a man vrith an object

in his moments of leisure is less fitted to occupy a place of trust than a mere ma-

chine who has no idea beyond the mechanical duties of his profession. And not

without reason has the seaman this fear--a fear which, I know, weighs considerably

with conscientious captains, who would, if they received the sanction of their owners,

do great service to science, without abating one jot of their vigilance and activity

--in their primary duties. The main point, then, to be considered is how shipowners

generally can be induced to sanction in their masters the cidtivation of those tastes

which they often possess, and which cannot but have a beneficial efiect upon their
--140 REPORT 1861.

character, and the improvement of those opportunities which they so abmidantly
enjoy. This is the great desideratum, and imtil this is done, no gi-eat good can be

effected. The ship-captain of intelligence must know that his attention to natm-al

history, or any other branch of science not immediately connected with ship duties,
is not only not looked upon with suspicion \)y his owner, but is encourcKjed by him.

He must feel that his master regards his scientific studies and attainments, not as
unfitting him for command and full confidence in the management of the import-

ant interests entrusted to him, but as absolutely rendering hun more trustworthy,
on the principle enunciated by a well-known member of the mercantile marine
service, that " a man ^vith a hobby is always safer both at sea and on shore than a
thoroughly idle man." The advantages which might be expected to accrue from
such a plan are manifold. Museums such as those of Liveipool and Manchester
should not lack specimens in any department, with such a staff of industrious and
intelligent collectors constantly bringing contributions. But by no means the least
important residt woidd be the elevation of the mercantile marine service as a body,
and their emancipation from the evUs too often looked upon as inseparable from
their habits of life, by giving them a rational object upon which they may expend
their energies, when not called upon by pressing duties on board ship. They have
no resources such as those possess whose life is passed on shore, and it cannot be
othei-wise than that, herding together, as they do, for months at a time, with scarce
any of the amenities of life, their minds should degenerate to a dull blank, or eveq
to a worse condition ; and it too often happens that in this respect the captain is in
no degree superior to his crew. Regarded, therefore, from a philanthropic point of
view, it is a subject worth inquiring into, whether or not some scheme may be

rendered feasible by which tliis opprobrium may be removed. No shipowner will

deny that such an amelioration of the seaman's character woidd be ultimately fol-
lowed with advantage to his o\ra personal interest; but that advantage is not to
be reaped suddenly, and it is too distant in its prospect to offer much inducement
to take much trouble to accomplish it. The direction which I have here supposed
the ship-captain's energies to take is, however, bj^ no means the only one which

may be followed with usefulness and advantage. I have made it prominent be-
cause I believe it would, in a vast number of instances, be adopted -with most useful

results. But men's tastes, doubtless, differ considerably, and the study of natural
history would not commend itself to all. Various subjects of study might be fol-
lowed out advantageously, and the sciences of na\igation, meteorologj-, «fcc. would
receive important accession from the intelligence which a higher standard of edu-
cation would develope among our mercantile marine. Some stimulus, however,
would undoubtedly be needed to cany on this work ; and the nature of the rewards
which might be offered to induce the cooperation of seamen shoidd occupy our

carefid attention and consideration. Among the commanders of the mercantile
marine there are many intelligent men, who would gladly embrace the opportunity,

if it were offered to them, of aistingaiishing themselves in the wallis of science, and
raising themselves above the level to which they are at present doomed. Whether

this stimulus should be in the way of honorary certificates, pecuniary or honorary

 rewards, association with scientific bodies already in exi.' fence, or of any other kind,
 woidd be an impoi-taut matter for after consideration, t have said, however, enough

to bring the matter fairly before you, and in your hands I now leave it, hoping it
may not be permitted to fall to the gi'ound, but may be taken up by the influential
members of the Association connected either with science or with commerce, my
own humble cooperation being always at theu' service.

--by its own fibres connected. Yet the consumers state it will not spin a customary

objection to anjiihing new. More recently a similar import (about half a dozen

bags of 70 lbs. each) came from the River Plate via Pernambuco. Any quantity
can be had fi-om the east side of the Andes and the plains of the Amazon. As to

the staple of the cotton, it is very silky and short ; but by grafting-, or superior
technical cultivation known to naturalists, it might no doubt be improved. Large
quantities must be brought to market, and then machinery will be altered to siut

its working, as was the case with alpaca, which has a sQky fibre. He sold one bag

of the Barrugudo cotton at Sd. per lb. ; but, as the Yorkshire buyer did not accept
delivery, the whole of the last lot was taken by the importer for stufling sofa

cushions and mixing in feather beds, instead of purchasing swandowu at 12s. Gd.
per lb. Here is a large field for the use of such fibres ; and if brought to this
coimtry in large quantities, it must be mixed with cotton, like Mingo or devil's
dust, or be spun up with sheep's wool. Through the kindness of J\[r. M. J. "NVhitty,
of the ' Liverpool Daily Post,' the wi'iter was authorized to exhibit a sample of new
fibre from the wild flax of North America. Millions of bales, he states, can be

obtained at a cost of less than id. per lb., so profusely does the wild flax exist.

These new fields ought to command attention when there is so much anxiety to
increase the supply of cotton. The author contends that six million acres of land

in Ireland can be had at a nominal rent, on which good cotton can be grown, the
land never having been gi-azed, scratched, or nibbled by cattle.

    This violet, although its petals are of a unifomily yellow colour so long as the

roots are in contact with the zinc, seems to be a mere variety of the common Viola
lutea, which has purple petals when it grows on ordinary soil ; and accordingly, on
the confines of the two sh-ata, the petals of the plant are partly yellow and partly
Eiu-ple. The author made some fm-ther remarks upon the absoi-ption of mmeral

  odies by the roots of plants, and in conclusion gave it as his opinion, that the
selective power possessed by them indicated a force independent of any physical
cause, and which he therefore regarded as of vital origin.

   He said that, as he could not conform to what he believed was the rule, that

communications should be read (Mr. Fawcett being blind), he would promise to
keep as close to his subject as though he had vn-itten his paper. The title which
he originally fixed upon was, " That the method of iuA-estigation pursued by Mr.
Darwin, in his Treatise on the Origin of Species, is in strict accordance with the

principles of logic." He feared that he might be charged with presumption in

attempting to say anything on Mr. Daiwin's gi-eat work, which had already en-

gaged the attention of the most accomplished naturalists of the day. He had been

assured that the discussion on the subject at the last Meeting of the Association

had never been sm-passed in the interest it excited or in the talent which it called

forth. Indeed, the work had divided the scientific world into two gTeat sections

Darwinite and anti-Dai-winite were almost the badges of opposite parties. Professor

Owen, Professor Sedgwick, and Mr. Hopkins had given to the new theory a decided

opposition ; Sir Charles Lyell, Professor Huxley, and Dr. Hooker had given to it a

support more or less decided. All who took an interest in the subject had a right to

-- --inquire whether the theory whatever might be thought of its details had been

logically brought foi-wai'd. The province of logic was not to discover new facts,

but to decide whether facts were legitimately used to establish that which it was

pretended they proved. It was constantly alleged that Mr. Darwin was illogical

that he had not followed the Baconian method. The ' Quarterly Re-\aew ' assured

ns that Mr. Danvin had not followed in the steps of Newton and of Kepler ; but

nothing was more easy than to make such charges, which often only concealed pre-

tentious assumptions of scientific knowledge. It was more pertinent to inquire

What is the method of solution of which such a problem admits ? He insisted that

--if ever solved it could only be by a method analogous to that attempted by IMi'.

Darwin. It coidd only be solved in this way : An hypothesis, resting upon more

or less perfect induction, must be started ; from that hj^othesis certain deductions

must be da-awn ; these deductions must be tried, by seeing whether they would

explain the phenomena of nature, and they must be verified hj seeing whether they

agreed with what can be observed in natm-e. If this explanation and verification

was complete, the hj-pothesis was advanced from an unproved to the position of a

proved and established theory. The Bishop of Oxford last year said that the theory

was so absm'd that no scientific man coidd for a moment think that it was in any
degi-ee worth considering. But Dr. Hooker, than whom a more eminent authority

could not bo quoted, at once disposed of the Bishop by saying, that as he believed

the theory worth considering, he ought to " apologise for addressing the meeting as

a man of no scientific autliority." Dr. Hooker added that he knew of the theory

five years before ; that, at first, no one more opposed it ; but five years' devotion to

natiu'al history had convinced him that the theory was worthy of the most careful

consideration and examination. Mr. Darwin, with the most perfect candour, ex-

plained in his work that his theoiy did not yet explain           all  the facts of nature                                                                      but
                                                                                                                                                             ;

it must not be supposed that his twenty years' laboiu* had done nothing to advance the

ends of science. Mr. Dai-win had strictly followed the rules of the deductive method

as laid down by John Stewart Mill. AVhen Kepler inferred his law of the connexion

between the major axis of the planets and the times of their revolution, he so in-

ferred fi'om observation, which he could strictly verify by mathematical calciUation.

The origin of species does not admit of such a verification. In chemistry there was

much more power of proof or verification by experiment than was possible in phy-

siology ; so with other sciences. When laws of nature cannot be discovered by

experiment, we are obliged to go to deductive reasoning. Newton had only an

hj'pothesis, and not a theory, as to the law of gi'avitation ; the law he first tried

was an incoiTect one. He tiied again ; and then, as Professor Whewell said, by a

tentative process he discovered the correct law. Mr. Darwin had told him (the

speaker) that his hj-pothesis was not at once suggested to him. He foimd in his

studies that there was something wanted to explain many of the observed pheno-

mena                         years passed,  and  at  length  his  h_y])othesis was very indirectly suggested
                          ;

for he said that it came from reading Malthus's 'Essay on Population.' Twenty

years of unremitting labour he had devoted to the endeavour to verify the conclu-

sions which might be deduced from this hjqwthesis by the facts observaljle in nature.

He believed that Mr. Darwin's second work, for which the author had acciunulated

a gi-eat mass of knowledge, would prove beyond doubt that no one could have been

--a more conscientious or laborious observer than he had been. Newton coidd verify

his hypothesis by the simplest experiment he had but to drop a stone from a tower

and to note the time occupied in its descent. But the problem of the origin of spe-

cies is concerned with an epoch of time associated with geological epochs ; there-

fore experiment could only be made during so short a time, that nothing more could

be obtained than an argiiment resting on a, comparatively speaking, unsatisfactory

analogy. Darwin had been able to show that by a system of artificial natural selec-
                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                     143

tion two organisms, originally descending from the same form, could be made to

differ so much, that if they were found as fossLls they would undoubtedly be classed

as distinct species ; and, therefore, how a morphological species coidd be produced.
But his experiments had failed to show how a physiological species coidd be

produced; for no one could show that two varieties from the same form could be
made to differ so much that they would possess the quality of infertility. This
was too often forgotten by objectors. The Egyptian scidptm-es were pointed to to

prove that dm-ino- 3000 years the causes looked to by Darwin had done nothing to
alter the form of animals. But what woidd be said to him who, by discoverino-
that 3000 years ago Mont Blanc was of the same altitude as now, should thinE

that he had thus disposed of the theories of modern geology, that the stupendous

peaks of Switzerland were lifted from then ocean bed, and that every change on
the sm-face of the earth had been produced by an indefinite continuation of physi-

cal causes which are in ceaseless operation ? Mr. Darwin admitted that o-eology

did not show that in animal life there had been those transitional linSs tliat

ought to exist according to his theory, and according to any other of gradual

ti-ansmutation. He (the author) could not see that this theory detracted one iota
from any of the attiibutes of the Creator. If we suppose that the inti-oduction
of every new species required a distinctive act of creative will, then, of course,
the Creator must have intei-posed every time a new species was introduced. But,
if we supposed that every living organism has descended fi-om those fonus in which

life was first placed upon this planet, it does not in the slightest degTee dispense

vdth the necessity of supposing that life coidd only first be so placed by the act of
Onmipotent Creative Wdl. It was a favom-ite illustration in religious works, the

discovery of Newton which explains how planetaiy motions are produced ; and
he (Mr. Fawcett) believed that if ever the day came when the origin of species

should be explained in fidness and simplicitj^, he who so explained it would be

considered not only to have advanced science, but to have conferred a benefit upon
religion. The attackers of Darwin forget that he has not attempted to displace a

Wetheoi-y received as right, but merely to throw some light where all before was dark.

      shoidd, therefore, be all the more ready to welcome the conscientious labom-a

of one who like Mr. Darwin had imremittingly devoted himself to explain to some
extent what had been aptly tenned the "mystery of mj'steries."

On the Arrest ofPuparial Metamorphosis o/ Vanessa Antiopa or Camhenvell

              Beauty. By George D. Gibb, M.B., M.A., F.O.S.

After making a few remarks upon defomiities and an-est of development amongst

the insect tribe, the author proceeded to describe some examples occmTuio- in the

Vanessa Antiopa, which were exhibited to the Section. Of twenty-eight specimens

which he had obtained in the month of Jidy, all underwent complete metamor-

phosis, with three exceptions. These to some extent illustrated the                                  proo°ress  of
the process of emersion of the imago from the pupa-case.

   In the first specimen, the first stage of emersion was accomplished, i. e. a part
of the wings had protruded from each lateral fissure throughout its whole lenoih

to the extent of ^Vths of an inch, permittmg a view of the anterior part of the
thorax. Metamorphosis then became an-ested, and existence terminated.

   In the second example emersion was more advanced ; the left wings had emerged
a J of an inch only, whilst the right almost wholly protruded, but remained in
contact with one another. The puparial case is on the point of freedom, and the
lower part of its abdominal segment is empty. Here further metamorphosis
became arrested, and life ceased.

In the third, emersion was complete ; metamorphosis, however, was not so, and

it was associated with malformation. The right anterior wing was fidly expanded

whilst the posterior was cnimpled up. The left anterior vdng was almost wholly

wanting                                   a  mere  rudimentary appendage  existed  two lines  long.  The left posterior
                                       ;

win^ was only partly expanded posteriorly, the remainder being crumpled up.

The author entered into the probable causes of these aiTests of change and deve-»

lopment, and believed that they did not depend upon injury, fi-om the care taken
when the chrysalides were first collected.

On the Height of the Gorilla: a Letter from Dr. J. E. Gray, F.R.S.

Much difference occurs in the statements of travellerj and others with reference

to the height of the great African ape. Bowdich, the first traveller by whom it

was mentioned, under the name of the Lu/cha, states it, on the authority of the

natives of the Claboon, to he generally 5 feet high ; bat in some recent notices it

has been asserted to reach the height of 6 feet 2 inches ; and the specimen exhibited

at the meeting of German naturalists at Vienna is said, on good authority, to have

measured more than 6 feet in height. The measurement of a stuffed skin without

bones is necessarily delusive, depending as it does, first, on the mode in which the

skin has been originally prepared, and, secondly, on the extent to which the artist

may be disposed to stretch it. Such measurements are not to be relied on unless

they are in accordance with those of the bony skeleton ; and it therefore occun-ed

to me that it would be desirable to measure the long bones of the limbs of the dif-

ferent skeletons existing in the British Museum, the osseous structure giving the

-- Aonly certain dimensions on which reliance can be placed. The skeletons in the
British Museinn are six in number, viz. 1.  skeleton, obtained from Paris by

Prof Owen, and moimted in the best French manner. 2, 3, 4. Skeletons of male,

Afemale and young, purchased fromM. Du Chaillu. 5. skeleton of a male, purchased

       On the Flora of Manchester. Bij L. H. GuiN'ooy.

 --After some observations on the climate and soil of Manciiester, tlie author re-

marked : " The positive character of tlie Manchester Flora consists in tlie presence

or 370 or .380 British plants, which are indifl'erent to tlie soil they grow upon, and

wliich clay and sandstone suit as well as any other. These are, oi course, tlie com-

mon plants of the country in general ; and were it not that the peat-bogs furnish

many species peculiar to such habitats, and that the low level of the country and

the abundance of moisture combine to the production of innumerable marshy hol-

--lows, in which plants are fouud plentifully that the limestone districts afford penu-

riously or not at all were it not for these, tlie Manchester Flora would lie no more

than a list of cosmopolites. The ponds of the district, locally called ' pits,' are in-

numerable. In Chesliire they often become enlarged into beautiful sheets of water,

called 'meres,' which greatly enhance the picturesque character of the northern

parts of that county. South-east Lancashire contributes also a peculiar class of

habitats in its innumerable and very pretty little winding ravines, locally called

' doughs,' the sides clothed with trees, and a stream running along the bottom.

These, like the marshy hollows, supply many plants in great abundance that

districts more favoured in soil aud climate fail to offer, and, along with the peat-

mosses, supply the principal part of what is locally interesting. Of rare and extra-

ordinary plants we do not possess a single instance, except when thej^ appear, as in
Weother places, adventitiously.
                                                                                                          have no permanent treasures or rarities, such as

give celebrity to St. Vincent's Roclfs, the Great Omishead, and the Scotch moun-

tains. If a claim to such a character can be asserted by any of our plants, that

claim must come from Carex clom/ata." In conclusion, he noticed some of the

more remarkable and conspicuous plants of the district. He added that, on a

review of the whole subject, it appears that the Manchester district, although

expo.sed to some great disadvantages, is quite as productive of interesting plants as

any other. They are fewer in number aud they are less brilliant in appearance

nevertheless the botanist who woidd wish to enjoy himself, and to find everything

necessary to intimate acquaintance with the tj-jjes of the British Flora, needs not to

distress himself at the seeming dearth of JMancliester. If he will seek ho will find,

his reward augmenting in the ratio of his philosophy.

In this paper the author gave the results of his study of the Polyzoan ovicells, and

showed, in opposition to the view of Professor Huxley, that these organs are not

"marsupial pouches" into which the ova pass to complete their development.

Repeated observations had convinced him that the ovum, which was idtimately

developed into the ciliated embryo, was produced within the ovicell, in an ovarian sac,

which were produced within the cells. These were never ciliated, and only escaped
after the death of the polj-pide. Theii' history required fui-ther investigation.

On Daphnia Schsefferi, ivith a Diagram. By the Kev. A. R. Hogait, M.A.

So few observers have paid any attention to the family to which this little ani-

mal belongs that any fi-esh notes on its habits or economy are acceptable. In com-

mon with several other allied Entomostraca, Daphnia Schfrffcri bears the English
name of " Water-flea," and German of " Wassertloh ;" but t have not been able to

discover any pecidiar suitability iu the appellation, there being nothing in common

between it and its terrestrial namesake, except restlessness.

mostraca, which occur iu millions in some of the rocks of Germany, well Lllusta-ates

Mythe important part assigned to these creatures on our globe.  fii-st acquaiut-

anffe with the species of which this paper is the subject was made at Shaftesbury

in Dorsetshire, where they are found abundantly in the water artificially supplied

to the town for diinking pm-]^)oses. On the 13th of February, 1861, I received six

apparently fidl-gTOwn specimens j these I jDlaced in a vessel which admitted of

my obserrag their reproduction and subsequent deA'elopment. Within a day or

two afterwards, the water in which the D. Sclxcffcri were placed appeared to

swai'm with j'oung, exceedingly minute, yet visible not only iu the water, but

also within the parents' shelly integuments, where, throiigh the semitransparent

valves, they might easily be seen moving about, and seemingly trying to effect an

exit. Those which had already escaped were aU peifoi-ming the same cm-ious

gjTations which distinguish the mature indi\'iduals. It is the habit of these crea-

tures to keep imceasingly s'n'imming roimd and round in a vertical circle, and no

one who has ever seen it can avoid being struck witli its gracefLilness. When-

ever they wish to change the locality of their revolutions, they swim by sudden

and rapid jerks, but in a direct line, to another place, and then recommence

wheeling up and do'wn. Sometimes, however, they rest from motion entirely.

Eight weeks after the bhth of their young, all the original Daphniffi were dead,

but the former had not yet attained more than half their size, nor shown any signs

of reproduction. At this time I had about thu"ty-five specimens. But another

six weeks sufficed to bring about the complete ti-ansformation ; and after seeing

them for the last tune cast their exuvice, I had the satisfaction of observing that

the full size of the original specimens was in some instances attained, and some

young again produced. They were, however, not at all so prolific as those which

had been captured full-grown ; and as the whole life of the Daphniaj had passed

under review, I did not care to retain them longer alive, but placed the bred

specimens, which had already reached matmity, in alcohol for exhibition to the

Association.

   Fiu-ther observation will no doubt reveal many more details of interest regarding

these animals.

   Mr. Jeffreys exhibited specimens of Cyathina Smithii, which he had dredged at
a depth of nearly 90 fathoms in sandy gTomid, about 25 mUes N.E. of the Unst
lighthouse in Zetland. The peculiarity of the specunens consisted in their being
inversely conical, instead of their having the usual form of that coral, which is

cvliiidrica], and tliis appeared to be owing to their having been attached to cases
of the Pomatocents arietimis (sometimes called Ditn(pa mhnhta), a Dcntalium-
like Annelid. One specimen was attached to a perfect case, others adhered to
frf^ments of cases, while the rest bore no trace of attachment and were quite free.
In the last-mentioned state they appeared to agi-ee with a drawing and description
given by Dr. John.«ton, in his admirable work on British Zoophytes, of a spe-

cimen received by him from Professor Edward Forbes, who considered it to be the
TurbinoUa borealis of Dr. Fleming. The specimens now exhibited had much the
aspect of TurbinoUa or SjiJKe^iotrochi. Cyathina Simthnis not micommon in the same

seas where these specimens were obtained, but at a less depth than is above stated,
and its usual habitat is on rocks and stones, to which it is permanently attached by
its entire base. The explanation offered by Mr. Jetireys for the abnoi-mal form of
his specimens is, that they had attached themselves to empty cases of the Povia-

tocerus, being the only hard and stationary substances they could find in their

unusual habitat (sand), and that when these cases were broken oft', the base of the
corals became rounded by attrition against the sand, and they thus assumed their
present shape. The first-fonned layers, which constitute the base of the coral, are
soon deserted by the animal ; and there appear to be no means of repairing any
injmy to that part, much less of the coral reaflixing itself to another prop. Speci-
mens of Cyathina sometimes have also a very naiTow base when they are attached

to other corals. Mr. Jeffreys observed, that the pecidiarity in question appeared to
be the result of a well-known law, or inherent principle of organization, by which
a change of external conditions influences to a certain extent the form of animals
and plants, and that such modification of fomi is not due to what has been called
" natural selection."

Alsorhing Poiver of tlie Roots of Plants. By Dr, Jessen.

Dr. Daubeny had established that different species of plants, gi-owing in the same

soil, take up therefrom different foods, and contain minerals in different proportions.

--This selection, it will be said, is made through " vital force " a convenient phrase

for hiding anything that you cannot or have not inquired into. If we went down

to the elementaiy composition of the living body, the teim might be defined as

meaning the formation and combination of cells. In this sense it coiTesponds with,

and has com]iaratively the same range as, the tenn " ciystallizing force " as regards

minerals. The force that puts together crystals and that which puts together cells

and forms them into lining bodies, is equally an unknown force ; we use for each
the term mentioned. Taking " vital force " to mean the formation and combina-

tion of cells, the secretive power of plants was thence to be explained. Some

ancient philosophers held that plants desired and selected food nearly in the same

way as animals. Tliat opinion was long ago given up ; but where is the difference
between animals and plants? Men and animals move to food that they want;

plants gi-ow for it. This was a point too often overlooked. But animals can move

away or cease to take food when satisfied; plants advance their roots amongst

their food, and they cannot use the same parts of the same root for obtaining that

food a second time. They have, so to speak, to throw out new fibres every time

Athey want food.  sormd rootlet took up fluid, whether nutritive or not, in a man-

ner different from an injm'cd one ; and many physiologists and neai-ly fill chemists

have experimented on wounded plants, without luiowing it, o'wang to the delicate

handling which rootlets require. The absoi-ption goes on by eudosmosis through

the bark-cells. Dr. Graham says that by eveiy such process the membrane of these

cells is thinned and dissolved ; that the endosmosis is different for every different,

membrane ; and that the force of endosmosis is altered not only by the different

natm-e of the substances going into the cell, but also by the nature of the sap in

the cell itself. The author considers these facts, as made out by Mr. Graham, to

be the starting-point of a new era in the physiology of nutrition. No one has yet

taken up the matter and pointed out the value of these discoveries ; and it was
sufficient at present to point out that Dr. Graham shows that any slight difference

in the composition of the membrane, or of the contents of a cell, rtII be a sufficient

cause for a decided difference in the natme of the food introduced into it. The

point of a rootlet is of a very different structiu-e fi'om its upper part. It serves only

for the growinp: out of the rootlet, whose colls are ormed in the upper part. Many

nmof the cells  into sliort hollow hairs, which, like the cells, have a very thin mem-

brane. The fluid taken in by the rootlet after a time destroys the outer layer of cells,
and the second layer conies into play; but the constant production of new cells in the

interior causes the rootlet to increase in size. Passing from cell to cell, the fluid

becomes changed into sap ; but the sap difters in every cell, and each cell, around

one well filled, gets out of it a different kind of food. The author contends that it

is not possible to get into a plant anything that is a poison to it. The result will

be, if poisonous matter is present, that the outer layer of cells will be destroyed,

succeeding layers presenting themselves, and also being destroyed, so long as the

poison exists around. If the poison gets into the outer cells before they are wholly

destroyed, it will not be talcen up so readily as nutritious liquid ; and in any case,

after ti'aversing a few rows of cells, all poison will be retained, while other portions

of the plant will remain uninjured.

On the Relation between Pinnate and Palmate Leaves. Bij Maswe'll T. Mas-

           ters, F.L.S., Lecturer on Botany, St. Oeorge^s Hospital, London.

   It is now generally admitted that the difl'erent fonns of leaves, in spite of their
immense number, may be reduced to one or two primary fonns, the deviations fi-oni

which are to be accoimted for by such circumstances as increased growth in one
direction as contrasted with that in another, arrest of development at particular
places, and the like. The ensuing remarks merely tend to confirm this opinion and

to add additional illustrations of it.

   There are many cu'cmnstances leading to the inference that true palmate leaves,

as well as those that are pabnately divided, are but modifications of true pinnate
leaves, or of pinuately divided ones ; that in the palmate leaf gi-owth takes place
more in a lateral direction than in a vertical one, whereas growth in length at the
expense of gi'owth in breadth is the guiding principle in pinnate leaves ; the one,
so to speak, is a broad leaf, the other a long leaf Again, in the palmate leaf there
is an arrest of development in the portions of the loaf intermediate between the lobes
or leaflets according as the leaf is simple or compound, and thus the palmate leaf

may be regarded as a contracted pinnate leaf. In support of these assertions the
writer may refer to the fact, that pinnate and palmate leaves exist in the same

genera ; compare the leaves of Acer pscudo-platami ^, for instance, with those oi Acer
Kc'ffumlo, the leaves of liiibits micrantJnts with those of liiihus fruticosui; indeed the

circumstance is of such common occmTcnco that it is imnecessary to give further
illustrations of it. Of pi-eater value for our present purpose are those instances where
we have both kinds of leaf on the same plant ; take, for instance, Pyriis trilohata

trace the transition of the leaves from pinnate to p.ahnato in Authjllis vulneraria or
the various species oi Lotus, wherein the lower leaves are pinnate, the upper palmate.

The connnon raspbony, Riihus idmis, will fmnish another example ; the lower leaves
have sc^'cr.al pairs of pinna?, the upper have but tlu'oe leaflets ; in such cases as this
("and the}' are nmnerous), the tv/o conditions merge one into the other, so th.at it is
ditflcult, mthout taking analogy as our guide, to determine whether a temate or a

teiiiately divided leaf belongs to the pinnate or to the palmate series.

   The wi-iter has frequently observed in the oriental plane, Plutanm orimtalis, leaves

of almost every variety of shape and marginal incision, fi-om oblong or lance-shaped
and entire to palmatisict, the latter being the usual fonu of the leaves of this tree.

In the entire long leaves there is but a single largo rib, the lateral ones being much
less in size, vdiereas in the fully developed condition there are three to five main ribs

diverging orto from the other at an acute angle, a short distance above the base of
the leaf (hipli- or quintupli-costate). In the ' Linna;a,' vol. xi. 1829, is mentioned
the case of some horse-chestnut leaves which had assumed more or less of a pinnate
character ; and this season the writer has been fortimate enough to find several pre-
senting similar changes from their ordinary condition, and manifesting almost every
intermediate stage between pinnate and palmate leaves ; similar instances not im fre-

quently occur in the leaves of the common white clover, TrifoUum rcpem. A^'ere
it necessary to do so, many additional instances might be cited leading to the same

conclusions, that pinnate and palmate leaves are merely modifications of the same

typo; that the ternate leaf is an impari-pinuate leaf; the binate leaf is the simplest

In a fonncr paper read at the Economical and Statistical Section last yeai* at

Oxford, the author pouited out the great jjational importance and gi'owing- pros-

peiitj^ of                                  the British heniug-fisheiy                                                                                                                          in the present paper he restricted himself to
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

that important part of the natm-al history of the herring connected with its migTa-

tion, -with the ^-iew of proving that the hemngs visiting the various coasts are

undoubtedly natives of the said coasts and the adjacent seas, and that they do not

come from any distant part of the ocean. The fact once satisfactorily established,
that the herrings belong to the adjacent seas or coasts; may direct public attention
more closely to the importance of thoroughly investigating their natm'al history. The

 ropriety of controverting the statements as to the migi'atiou of the herring must

Ie obvious when we find Pennfint's accoimt of its progress from the arctic regions
continued in each new edition of several works of high authority. Such works

state that " the herring comes from the arctic cu'cle, in large shoals of some leagues

extent, di\-iding into lesser shoals on coming towai-ds the north of Scotland, one

body proceeding to the west coast of Scotland and to Ireland, and another to the

east coast, eacn directing its couree southward." Others state that, although

hemngs do not come from the arctic cii-clo, they at least come from a considerable

distance northwai'd of Scotland. He, however, considered that as the henings

spawn upon our coasts, or in the rivers and bays, they are consequently natives,

and that, after spawning, the full-sized herrings proceed to sea in the neighbour-

hood of the coasts, where they continue, and where they feed until the spawning-

season again approaches; while the 3'Oung on being vivified continue near the

spa\\Tiing-grouud imtil they become of mature size. This is the most natural con-

clusion                                     and  after  several  other                                                                         remarks                                          he  said
                                         ;

We1. find every year, at a certain period of the year, a particular size of her-

ring generally resorting to the same place : for example, the size of the heri-ings
caught ofl' the projecting coast of Stadtland, in Norway, is much larger than the

size of those caught on the west coast of Shetland ; which kind, again, is nearly

twice as large as the first-caught Thurso hen-ings ; and these are smaller than the
Isle of Man, jMinch, and Loch Fyne herrings, smaller than the Caithness and Banff

hemngs, and much smaller than the herrings caught off Aberdeenshire, Fifeshire,

and Berwickshire. Again, the Yannouth hemngs are smaller than those of Aber-

deenshire                                   and Bei-wickshire                                                                                  and in the West Highland lochs                             the size of the her-
                                                                                                                                            ;

rings is distinctly seen and known; for instance, in some of the Highland lochs for

years Large quantities have been caught, unifomily of the 10th class, which are of

Aa very superior quality.                                                                                                                      size of hen-ings similar to those of Yannouth till

lately visited Liimfiord in Denmark, and still visits the coasts of that coimtry

while on the Mecklenbmg coast, in the Baltic, the size of the hemngs is larger

than those of Denmark ; and proceeding up the Baltic coast above Mecklenburg,
namely on the Pomeranian and part of the Prussian coasts, the herrings are fully

one-third smaller, and again still frnther up they are larger, and about the size of

the Moray Firth hemngs. Thus, those who argue that the hemngs come from the

north must fiu-nish two kinds of hen-ings, namely, one kind which in its ])rogTess

grows smaller on its journey, and another which gi-ows larger. Even in the English
Channel the varieties may be easily distinguished in the neighbom-ing localities

for instance. Professor Valenciennes, in his edition of Cuvier's ' Natural History

of Fishes,' vol. xx. p. 47_, says, " It is not difficult, -with a little practice, to dis-

cover the difference which exists between the hemngs fished near Calais and

those fished near Dieppe ; those fished near Calais have the body longer and more

Hat and compressed on the sides than those of Dieppe, which are rounder and

shorter."

2. As to quality, nothing so much proclaims the error of the tale of tlieir all

coming from the north as the general state of the herring. For instance, as already

mentioned, those caught off Shetland are not nearly so fat as those caught about

the same time on the coast from Thurso to Loch Broom. In the first of the season,
--150 REPORT 1861.

those caug-ht in Locli Fyne are not so extremely fat or oily as the early Thurso

herrings, and the herrings of Loch Fyne are superior in quality to those of the east

coast. Again, there is a marked difference in appearance and quality (and this is

easily distinguished hy those accustomed to see them) between those caught near

Caithness and Morayshire, (tnd those caught off Aberdeenshire and Berwickshire.

The quality of the Danish and Baltic herrings is inferior to the Moray Firth and

West Highland henings ; and those caught on the coast of Holland ai-e so inferior

as not to be pickled at all by the Dutch. The Yarmouth henings are inferior in

some respects to those of the north of Scotland ; and the herrings got on the French

coasts are also of inferior quality.

3. As to the time of appearance, we find much to prove that the heri'ings .are

natives of the seas adjoinmg the coasts on which they spawn. As a few instances,
it may be stated as well known that herrings are caught in Loch Fjiie before any

are caught near Cape Wrath, and off Berwickshire and Aberdeenshire by the

Dutch  before any are caught off                                                                         Caithness                                                 and even off Yarmouth herrings' have
                                                                                                                                                                ;

Webeen caught in May.                                                                                    find they are not generally caught on the Atlantic side

so early as on the east coast of Scotland ; and the various times of their approaching

the coasts of the Baltic, as already stated, prove the fixity of then- places of resort.

  4. No well-authenticated instance has been given of the herrings having been

seen approaching the south in a high northern latitude. Indeed, although we have

conversed with intelligent masters of the Dutch herring-busses, we could not find
any one who ever saw any considerable shoal in the northern part of their fishing-

gTounds ; none of the seamen of om- Greenland whale-ships ever saw any of those

shoals of the magnitude so fabidously described proceeding southwards ; and

Scoresby, who is of high authority on such a question, made the same statement

to ourselves, namely, that he had not, in his many voyages, ever seen any shoals

of herrings proceeding southwards.

5. No shoals of hei-rings have ever been ascertained to exist in the Greenland

seas, and no hemngs have ever been found in the stomachs of the whales caught

there. The food of the Balcvna mysticetus, or common whale, consists of Actiuiffi,

Sepia3, Medusse, Cancri, and Helices. The Nanchal inhabits the seas near Spitz-

bergen ; but only remains of Sepite were found in the stomachs of several examined

by Scoresby. The Tricheais rosmarus (walrus or sea-horse) inhabits the icy seas

adjacent to Spitzbergen; in the stomachs of those examined, only shrimps, craw-

fish, and youn^ seals were foimd. Of other marine animals examined by him,

Scoresby says the Alca arctica (auk or puffin ) feeds principally upon shrimps" and a

small species of IIcUx                                                                                   of the Alca alca (little aiilv), that it also feeds on shrimps  ;
                                                                                                      ;

of the Colymbus Gylde (Guillemot), it feeds on shrimps and small fishes ; of the

ASqualus horcalis (Greenland shark) he says, " fish resembling a whiting was found

in the stomach of one that I killed." Captain I'hipps only caught the Cycloptcris

vipcrus (sucker) and the Gaclus carhonarius (coal-fish), and no henings, when

fishing near Spitzbergen. Moreover, Scoresby, in his list of " Fishes foimd in the

Arctic Regions," does not include hen-ings (Arctic Regions, vol. i. p. 540). Egcde,

who resided fifteen years in Greenland, after enumerating various kinds of fish
caught there, says, " No hemngs are to be seen " (Natural History of Greenland).

  We6. find that those species of whales that feed principally on herrings frequent

our own shores and those of Noi-way. Scoresby says of the Balcena muscxdus,

'' This species of whale frequents the coasts of Scotland, Ireland, Norway, &c., and

is said principally to teed on hemngs " (Voyages, vol. i. p. 482) ; and the Balcetta

rostrata inhabits principally the Noi-wegian seas.

  7. Bloch, the celebrated natm-alist (with whom Lacepede in this particidar state-

ment coincides), has established that fishes of a similar size, even in fresh water,

could not make, fi-om spring till autiunn, the long voyage attributed to the herring.

   8. The same natm-alist fm-ther states that " herrings may be fomid in certain

localities aU the year through," and this coincides with the opinion of the expe-

rienced fishermen at Loch Fyne and other places ; and it is well ascertained that
herrino-s, either young or old, may be caught in the Forth any month in the year.

   9. The herrings mentioned as coming from the north are never kno-\vn to retmn,

or even to proceed southward, but when proceeding to some coast for the purpose

of spawning.

10. And we may ask why, in some cases, the smallest liemngs proceed to the
                                                                                                                                      ;

                                                                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                151

   Baltic, and the larger to the North Sea ; and as it is asserted that the whales are

  the cause of their flying south, why do we not see the whale on every coast every

   year ? Mr. YaiTell, in his valuable work on Fishes (vol. ii. p. 112), truly says,
   " There can be no doubt that the herring inhabits the deep water all round oiu:
   coast, and only approaches the shore for the pui-pose of depositing its spawn within

 --the immediate influence of the two principal agents in vivilication increased tom-

   peratui-e and oxygen ; and as soon as that essential operation is effected, the shoals

  that hannt om- coast disappear, but individuals are to be found, and many are

   caught throughout the year."

      11. Various other fishes have similar habits in spawning. The salmon ascends
   the rivers from the sea at particular periods for the purpose of spawiiing: for

. this fish no distant seas have, however, been assigned. The sprat appears in
  shoals in various localities of the coasts of the British Islands from November to

 --March.^ The shad or Alosa is found in shoals in some of our rivers from May to

  July in the Severn generally in May, and it continues there about two months

  in the MediteiTanean, near Sm}Tua and Rosetta ; and it ascends the NUe as high as
  Cairo in December and January. The pilchard appears in shoals on the coast of

  Cornwall from June to the end of the j'ear ; and the timny comes in-shore on the
  coasts of the Mediterranean in summer. All these fishes appear to have the same
  habit of gregariously visiting various coasts and rivers at particular seasons for a
  similar piuijose; but no one woidd on this account pronounce them natives or
  inhabitants of a distant quarter of the globe. In short, from all the cu'cumstances

  kuo^vn of the natiu'al history of the herring, in regard to its visits on our own

  coasts and the coasts of other countries, it is reasonable to conclude that it inhabits
  the seas in the neighbom-hood of the coasts on which it spawns, and that it

  arrives at particular seasons near the coasts for the pui-pose of spawning, the shoals

  leaA-ing the coasts immediately thereafter ; and the early or late, and distant or
  near approach to the coasts in different years perhaps depends, as before remarked,

  on the clear and warm or dark and cold weather of the season, as well as upon

  the depth of water at the feeding- and spawning-gi-oimds.

   On the Cervical and Lumbar Vertcbrce of the Mole (Talpa EuropsDa, L.).
                      By Professor 0\ven, 3LD., LL.D., F.li.S.

  Few of our native fiuadnipeds have had their osteolog;s' more frequently described
and studied than the common mole, by reason of the singular and extreme modi-

fications of certain parts of the skeleton, and their readily recognizable adaptation
to the peculiai- sphere and habits of life of the animal. The author had not anti-
cipated, therefore, in making a recent scrutiny of the skeleton, finding anything
worth special notice that had not been noticed before, and could scaa'cely persuade

  himself tliat_ the fact he was about to communicate had escaped all previous obser-

 vers. Had it beeu mentioned, however, in any special monogTaph on the Talpa

 Jlnropcsa, vrhich might have escaped liis research, he thought it woidd have been
 considered worthy of a reference by the comprehensive and industrious Stamiius,

 and might have led the shai-p-sighted De Blaiu^-ille to a more rigorous scmtiny of
 the vertebral column than he had bestowed upon it in his MonogTaph on the Oste-
 ology of tiic Mole--the last on that subject with which comparative anatomy has
 been enriched. Jacobs, in his generally minute and accurate monogi-aph, when

 treating of the cervical vertebrre, notices only their spinous processes, and, after
 describing the lai-ge one of the Epistropheus, proceeds,--" Vertebra; colli ceterc-e

 processum spinosum habent nullum, et niagis annulis similes simt, quorum inter-

 stitia aspera) arterice intcrstitiis similes sunt " (p. 14), and this description has been
 g-eneally repeated. Cuvier writes,--" Dans les Taupes, elles (les cinq autres cervi-
 cales) ne ferment egalenient que des simples anneaux entre lesquels il y a beaucoup

--de jeu." So likewise Professor Eobert E. Grant wiites, " The remaining cervical

 vertebrce are behind, like so many loose rings, shorn of their spinous and transverse

 processes, to allow of the freest motion with safety to the spinal chord." Professor
 Bell more accurately states, " that in the Talpidas and the Soricidas the cei-vical
 vertebra; have strong transverse processes, and, excepting the second, do not pos-

sess any spinous processes." Professor De Blainville, in a more detailed accoimt

 of the skeleton, having express reference to the species under consideration (Talpa
 Europ(va), savs , " Les quatre denueres (vertebres cervicales) se ressemblent en ce
 que lour arc, fort etroit, ne preseute aucune trace d'apophyse epineuse ; les trans-

 verses sont egalenient peu marquees, sauf le lobe inferieur'de celle de la sixieme,
assez dilate, du moins trans versalement."

    If the cultivators of other, and more particularly of the exact, sciences were to
judo-e of zootomy by the discrepancy of the testimonies adduced by some of the
highest names in this science, as to a simple foct, easily determinable by observa-
tion, of one of our commonest native quadrupeds, they might conclude that the
foundation of our geno'alizations in comparative anatomy reposed upon an insecure

--basis, and that the metliod of obtaining- the materials for such basis by the first

process of induction the simple exercise of the eyes-- stood in need of much

improvement. For while one anatomist implies the absence of transverse pro-

cesses in the cervical vertebra; of the mole by his sUence, and another directly

aflirms their non-existence, a third describes them as being- " strong," and a fom-th
as being "little marked."

   The fact is, that these so-called " transvei-se processes " are not only present in
all the cenical vertebra;, but are variously and peculiarly developed, so as to give
the niole the same advantage in strengthening and stiifening its neck, and imped-
ing its lateral inflexions, which the crocodile derives from a similar modification of
what might, with equal propriety, be temied in it the " transverse processes of the

cervical vertebra;," viz. ]jy their intricate or reciprocally overlapping arrangement,

due to the shape and size of the costal elements of such transverse processes. But
the mole has so far the advantage over the crocodile in this arrangement as that,

whereas the costal part of the transverse process retains its foetal separation in the
cold-blooded Reptilia, it becomes finnly anchylosed to the other parts of the trans-

verse process in the small warm-blooded mammal. In a fomier memoir, " On the
Processes of Vertebnc," Professor Owen had given the results of an analysis of the

"cervical transverse process," showing it to consist of the autogenous " plem-apo-
phjsis," combined with the exogenous " parapophysis " and " diapophysis." In
the mole the pleurapophysis joins the diapophysis, circumscribing the vertebrarte-

rial foramen, and developing a short process from the point of junction. In the

third vertebra the pleurapophysis, or costal part of the " transverse process," is
compressed and produced backwards and a little outwards and downwards, over-

lapping the anteriorly produced part of the pleurapophysis of the fom-th cervical.

This portion of the " transverse process " much resembles the corresponding but

separate element in the same vertebra of the crocodile, except that it is " sessile,"

instead of being supported on a short peduncle; it is, for example, broad, com-

--pressed, and produced downwards, foi-wards, and backwards its larger and lono-er

posterior portion overlappin<j the anterior end of the pleurapophysis of the fi?th

vertebra, as the same part of itself is overlapped by the pleui-apophysis of the third
--154 REPORT 1861.

 A^ertebra. The posterior paii; of the pleiu'apophysis of the fourth cervical of the mole
 is further interlocked between the pleiu'apophysis of the fifth cerAical below, and
the anterior zygapophysis of the same vertebra above. The pleurapophysis of tlie
 fifth cervical resembles that of the fourth. In the sixth cervical it is much more
 developed, both forwards, backwards, and downwards, the pair forming the sides
 of a deep and wide channel on the under part of that vertebra. In the seventh

 cervical the plexu-apophysis is not developed ; the diapophysis forms a small obtuse

 prominence below the anterior zygapophysis, and, in the ordinary language of

anatomy, its " transverse process " would be said to be "imperforate." With re-
gard to the common description of the cervical vertebra} of the mole as mere rings

 of bone, the term is applicable only to the neural arclies of the five last vertebrnc,
none of which have a spine, except the third and seventh, and in these it appears

as a mere tubercidar beginning. The bodies of the vertebrre are subdepressed, but

otlierwise are well-developed quadi-ate bones, closely united, so as to concur with

the peculiar size, shape, and arrangement of the "transverse processes" above de-

scribed, to give strength to the neck and impede any lateral inflexions. It is easy
to show on a recent mole, when the cervical vertebi'as are exposed by removal of
the enormous masses of muscles with which they are surroimded, that the lateral
inflexions of the neck are confined to movements between the atlas and dentata, the
dcntata and the third vertebra, and between the sixth and seventh vertebra}, but
are as effectually impeded in the intervening vertebrfo as in the crocodile itself
Nor is the movement upwards and downwards between the same vertebrae of more
than a limited extent. The osseous style developed in the lif/amcntmii nucluc, co-
extensive with the cervical series, and rimning parallel with the course of their
undeveloped spines, stiffens the neck in respect of its vertical inflexions beyond the
atlas, as well as augments the lever power of tlie muscles which raise the head. If
the service to the mole of a stifl' neck in the fossorial applications of the snout and
head had been called to mind, the analogy of the more efficient modification to
that end in the bun-owing annadiUos, might have led to an examination of the
actual structure of this part of the slceleton of the mole, which would have ren-
dered xmnecessary the present communication on the subject.

   One of the objects Professor Owen had in view in troubling the Section with
what some might deem too trifling a matter, was to encourage younger compara-
tive anatomists to exercise their skill on indigenous sidjjects which may any day be

brought within their reach. Their organization is far fj-om being exhausted by
direct and original scrutiny, and the highest generalizations in comparative anatomy
might be tested and illustrated by the anatomy of our commonest fishes, reptiles,
birds, and mammals, independently of raiities from foreign shores.

   In conclusion, he might fiu'ther state respecting the mole, that its loins were
streng-thened by superadditions to their vertebras, precisely like those discovered
by Sir Philip Egerton in the cer^ncal vertebras of tlie Ichthyosaurus, viz. by a series
of " subvertebral wedge-bones " inserted into the inferior interspace between oacli
of the six lumbar vertebras, as well as between tlie first lumbar and last dorsal, and

between the last lumbar and tlie first sacral. Tlicse, which Professor Owen liad

determined to be "autogenous hypapophyses," have their broad, rhomboidal, smootli
and sliglitly convex base downwards, and their narrower end wedged upwards into
the lower part of the intei-vertebral substance. It is obvious that the lumbar re-
gion, cooperating with the pelvis, as the fidcrum during the vigorous actions of the
hind feet by which the loose earth is kicked out of the bm-row, must derive an
advantage from this superaddition to their fixation, analogous to that wliicli tlio
Ichthyosaunis derived from the wedge-bones of its cervical vei-tebra3. The lumbar
h^-papophyses of tlie mole had not escaped the notice of the shai-p-sighted Jacobs,

who speaks of them as " ossicula sesamoidea " (loc. eit. p. 17) ; but he deduces no

physiological consequence from the fact ; and his passing notice of the structure
had not been recognized by any subsequent wi-iter on the osteology of the Insec-

tivora. From no systematic work or monograph on comparative anatomy, indeed,

could the student acquire any hint of so curious a fact that the vertebral column
of the mole combined two peculiarities which are separately given in the reptilian
class, inz. to the Crocodilia and the Enaliosauiia respectively. This paper was
illustrated by diagrams of the structures described.

0)1 some Objects of Natural History from the Collection of M. Du Chaillu.

                        Brj Professor Oweit, M.D., LL.D., F.B.S.

   Tlie author's first knowledge of this zoological collection was derived from a letter

sent by M. Du Chaillu, dated Gaboou, June 13, 1859, and received in the British
Museum in August 1859, in which M. Du Chaillu specified the skins and skele-

tons of the gorilla or n'gena, kooloo-kamba, nschiego, and nschiego-mbovie which

lie had collected, offering them foV sale, with other varieties, to the British Museum.

Professor Owen replied, recommending the transmission of the collection to London

for inspection, with which recoiiimeiidation M. Du Chaillu complied, bringing with

him, in 1861, all the varieties he had named, with other objects of natiu'al history,

from which he permitted selections to be made. The skins of the adidt male and

female of the yoimg of the Trof/lodi/fcs (/orilla afforded ample evidence of the true

coloration of the species. In the male, the rufo-griseous hair extends over the

scalp and nape, terminating in a point upon the back. The pi-evalent gi-ey colom',

produced by alternate fuscous and light-grey tracts of each hair, extends over

the back, the hair becoming longer upon the nates and upon the thighs. The dark

fuscous colour gradually prevails as the hair extends down the leg to the ankle.

The long hair of the arm and forearm presents the dark fuscous colour ; the same

tint extends from below the axilla downwards and forwards upon the abdomen,

where the darker tint contrasts with the lighter grey upon the back. The scanty

hair of the cheeks and chin is dark ; the pigment of the naked skin of the face is

black.  The breast is almost naked                                                                                                                            and the hair is worn short or partially nibbed
                                                                                                                                                           ;

off' across the back, over the upper border of the iliac bones, in consequence, as it

appears, of the habit ascribed by M. Du Chaillu to the gTeat male gorilla of sleeping

at the foot of a ti-ee, resting its back against the trunk. Professor Owen proceeded

to describe the colour of the female gorilla, which, it appears, was generally darker

and of a more rufous tint than the male. In one female the rufous coloiu" so pre-

vailed as to induce M. Du Chaillu to note it as a 'red-rumped variety.' In the

young male gorilla, 2 ft. 6 in. in height, 1 ft. 7 in. in the lenglh of the head and

trunk, and 11 inches across the shoulder, the calvarium is covered with a well-de-
fined " skidl-cap" of reddish-coloured hair. The back part of the head, behind

the ears, the temples, and chin are clothed with that mixtiu'e of fuscous bro-^Ti and

grey hair which covers with a vaiying depth of tint the trunk, ai-ms, and thighs.

Tlie naked part of the skin of the face appears to have been black, or of a veiy

dark leaden-colour ; a few scattered straight hairs, mostly black, represent the
Aeyebrows.
            naiTow moustache borders the upper lip ; the whole of the lower lip

and sides of the head are covered with hair of the prevailing grey fuscous colour.

Tlie rich series of skulls and skeletons brought home by M. Du ChaiUu illustrate

some important phases of dentition. These phases were specified by Professor

Owen at length. The deciduous or milk dentition, it was remarked, was, in

the youngest specimen of the gorilla, something similar to that of the human

child, but an interspace equal to half the breadth of the outer incisor divides that

tooth from the canine, and the crown of the canine descends nearly two lines

below that of the contiguous milk molar. The deciduous molars dififered from

those of the human child in the more pointed shape of the fii'st, and much larger

size of the second. The dentition of the yoimg gorilla coiTesponds best with that

exemplified in the himian child between the eighth and tenth years ; the difference,

however, is shown in the complete placing of the true molar, whilst the premolar

series is incomplete. It was worthy of remark, also, that in both specimens ex-

amined the premolars of the upper jaw had preceded those of the lower jaw, and

that the hind premolar had come into place before the front one. In the later de-

velopment of the canines and the earlier development of the second molars of the

second dentition the gorilla differs, like the chimpanzee and the orang.?, from the

human order of dental development and succession. An opportunity of observino-
this order in the lower races of mankind is rare. Professor Owen availed himself

of the opportunity in the case of the male and female so-called dwarf Earthmen

from South Africa, exhibited in London in 1855. He found their dentition re-

spectively at the phase indicative of the ago of from seven to nine in the Eno-lish

child ; other indications agi-eed with this evidence of immatm-ity. The children

were of the dwarf Boschisnian race, and were dressed and exhibited as adults.
156 REPORT 1861.

Both showed the same precedency in development of canines and premolars which

obtains in the higher races of man. RefeiTing next to the variety of the chim-

panzee brought by M. Du Chaillu from the Camma Country and from near Cape
Lopez, Professor Owen remarked that this species accords specifically in its osteo-

logical and hirsute development with the Troglodytes tiu/er. It is stated by M. Du
Chaillu to be distinguished by the natives of Camma as "the nschiego-mbovie, from
the common chimpanzee {Troglodytes tiiger), called by them the nschiego. From

the character of the skins of the male and female specimens of this species brought

by M. Du ChaiUu to London, Professor Owen would have deduced evidence of a

distinct and well-defined variety of Troglodytes,

    Remarks on the late Increase of our Knoivledc/e of the Struthious Birds.

                       By P. L. ScLATER, M.A., Ph.D., F.R.S.

   After pointing out the general characters of the birds of the order Struthtones, and
the peculiarities displayed in the structure of the two families, the Sfruthionuhe
and Aptcry(iid(B, of which alone recent representati^-es were loiown, Dr. Sclater
called the attention of the Meeting to the large increase in our knowledge of the
species of this group of birds which had recently taken place. Lentil lately, each of
the types, Stndhio, liJica, C'asuan'us, Dromants, and A2rieryx, had been supposed to

be represented by a single species. There now appeared to be indications, more or

less precise, of the existence of twelve species ot Sfnitltionidcc, and (as the author
has abeady shown in his joint Report with Dr. Hochstetter on the genus Apteryx'^)
four species of the family Apieryyklce.

   The following Table was exliibited, giving the names of tliese species and their
localities, as far as they were known.

  On a New Mining Larva, recently discovered. By H. T. Stainton, F.L.S.

   The author remarked that it had long been notorious that larvoe of several orders
of insects lived between the two sui'faces of leaves of plants, forming tracks in the
fleshy substance of the leaf, and hence termed leaf-miners ; that from the time
of Reaumm-, nearly 130 years ago, observers had often paid considerable attention
to this class of insects, and that latterly a continued attempt had been made, both
here and in Germany, to discover all the species of leaf-mining larvte which be-

longed to tlie order Lepidoptera.

   Amongst the leaf-mining larvae were representatives of the four orders, Coleo-
ptera, Ilymenoptera, Lepidoptera, andDiptera; but at present few entomologists
attempt to study more than one order, and hence a collector of Coleoptera would
naturally neglect all Lepidopterous larvre and those he suspected to be Lepido-
pterous; in like manner a collector of Lepidoptera would reject all Coleopterous
larvcB and those he suspected]to belong to that order. Hence the same larva might

Abe suspected by both parties and peglected accordingly. lai-va which had lately

attracted considerable attention had in this way been noticed long ago, both here
and abroad, by Lepidopterists, but, being reputed bv them a Coleopterous larva,
had been neglected accordingly.

   HeiT Kaltenbach of /Vix-la-Chapelle, who had been devoting his attention to

mining-larvce of all orders, had met with this larva, and reared from it a,Micropteri/x;
and last spring Dr. Hofinann, of Ratisbon, had also reared a larva of the same genus.

   The genus Microj)teryx is a genus of small moths of the group Tineina ; but the
structure of the palpi is so singular, the neuration of the wings so peculiar, and the
wings so slightly clothed with scales, that some authors were disposed to question
their right to be considered Lepidoptera. Westwood, in 18-40, had expressed hia
rcgTct that the transformations of so anomalous a genus had not been detected.

   The larva3 of Micropfcryx had now been foimd very plentifrdly, and had clearly

established that the genus was truly Lqn'dopterous, as the only gTOup of insects to
wliich they coidd otlierwise have been refeixed, the Ti-ichoptera, have laiTse of a

very difierent structure.

   The most striking peculiarity of these Mtcropteryx-laxyas is a slight lateral pi'otu-
berance on the fifth segment, which has been noticed in several species. These
larvso are totally devoid of legs, and the hinder segments are much attenuated.

          On Varieties o/Blechnum Spicant collected in 1860 and 1861.

                                     By A. Stjjs^sfield.

   The BlccJmmn Spicant of Linnjeus, Lomaria Spicant of Hooker, is one of tlio
commonest of all Imown ferns. Its range of elevation extends from the sea-level
to the summits of the highest moimtains, though it flomishes most in the subalpine
regions. It is foimd in greater or less abundance in most of the geological fonnations,
most frequently of all in the siliceous formations of the Silui-iau, Old Red Sandstone,
and the Coal-measures, and is least plentifid on the moimtain limestone and the
chalk. From its extensive difiiision we might be led to expect that vaiieties
woidd be numerous, but till within a very late period these seem not to have been
recognized by the British botanists.

   Bentham, in his recent work on British plants, says it is one of the most constant

of all known ferns. Sir W. J. Hooker, in his ' Species Filicum,' notices but one

variety, fovmd near Waii-ingtou, Lancashfre, by Mr. Hobson of Manchester, about
--160 REPORT 1861.

forty years ago. It Is to Mr. Moore, of the Botanic Garden, Chelsea, in the

'·'Nature-printed Fems," that we are indebted for the bringing of the varieties of

this fern most prominently before the British pteridologist.
   Darin"- the la^t three 3'ears I and a few friends have examined some millions of

plants of the lihchnum Spicant in various parts of the United Kingdom, collecting

all the abnormal forms we could meet witli, afterwards carefully growing the;n,

watching sedulously their development, and noting their peculiarities. This, speak-

in o- for myself, whilst it has afforded me a fund of innocent enjojnnent, has enabled

me to report on the permanency of some forms and the fugacity of others, and

on the general characters of the whole. I purpose here noticing only the more

striking among the pemianent forms that have stood the test of cultivation, some

of them for two and others for three years.

These have perfectly distinct and fixed characters, like species; and in those that

have been raised from spores, the complete identity of the parents has been main-

tained. For instance, out of ninety plants raised from the spores of Blechmon Spi-

ccmt mhserratum, no difference from the parent plant could be detected, whilst the

minutest peculiaiities were faithfully repeated. Thus a few of the lobes, both

of the fertile and barren fronds of the parent plants, were twins, or bilobate : the

young plants have all the same pecidiaiity. Out of seventy plants raised fi'oni

spores of Blechmon S. imbricatum, every plant seemed perfectly identical with tlie

parent. Out of 100 plants raised from spores of Ulechinon S. i-amosum, all had the

same ramosely cristate termination of the parent.

Our ideas of species are exceedingly vague and indefinite, and indeed it may be

questioned whether they have any real foundation in natm-e. Doubtless great

numbers of plants now regarded as species are merely variations of other forms. Be

this as it may, we loiow that, the forms of Blechnum Spica»f, to wliich I am about

to refer, are vai'iations from a primary type, tliougii they possess specific dilferences

which in other genera would, I apprehend, be suHlcient to constitute them species.

But in whatever light we regard them, it is quite essential that we should give

distinct names to obviously distinct and permanent forms.

  The form of Blechnum ISpicant which first arrested my attention was the B. S.

concinnmn of Moore. It was so essentiallj' distinct from the common ti,'pe, and so

beautiful an object, that it determined mo at once to give the Blcchna a thorough

investigation. It was gathered in the valley of the Conway in Nortli Wales early

in 1859. I subsequently gathered it near tlio foot of Twelve Pins, Connemara,

Ireland, and in Thieveley Scouts, near BuiTdey, Lancashire. Fronds linear, from G

to 12 inches in length, and from j to i inch in breadth ; lobes very sliort, subrotuud,
and beautifLdly crenated on the margins. Fertile frond : lobes little more than

nodes bearing sori. In cultivation the linear outline of the frond is maintained, but

when liberally supplied with water the lobes become enlai-ged, so as to make a slight

approach to B, S. strictum, from which, however, it remains quite distinct.

Blcchmm Spicant strictum (Moore). Fronds ovate-lanceolate, from to 12 inches

in length, and from ^ to I inch in breadth ; lobes mostly recurved, and distinctly

serrated on the margins. Fertile fi'ond longer than the ban-en, lobes short and ser-

rated on the margin. I have gathered this beautiful form in the valley of the

Conway, and near the Pass of Nant Francon in Wales, in Connemara, Ireland,

Vale of Todmordcn, Lancashu-e, and some other localities. It is perfectly constant

Blechmm S. lancifolium (Moore).  Somewhat less than the normal t^-pe fronds
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

acutely lanciform, entu-e fr-om the apex to Jrd their lengtli ; fertile fronds still more

acutely lanciform, lobes much abbreviated above and below. This has been

gathered near Todmorden, Lancashii-e, Trefriw, North AVales, and in Connemara.

Blechnum S. suhserratum (Moore). Size of tlie normal t}-pe ; fronds rather nar-

rower; lobes ascending, serrated on the inferioi-, and frequently aiu-icled on the

superior margin ; fertile fronds longer than the barren, lobes deeply serrated on tlie

inferior limb, fr-equeutly all but bipinnatifid. Gathered near Todmorden, and neai-

Castle Howard, Yorkshire.

Blechnum S. imbricatum (Moore). Fronds from 4 to 6 inches long, and from

1 to 2 inches broad, nearly ovate in outline, thick and leathery in texture ; lobes

closely imbricated, recurved, the apical lobe t-wisted ; fertde fronds very little

longer than the barren. Gathered in the Vale of Todmorden, in Eosseudale, Lane, j

Blechnum S. imhricnto-suhcrenatum. Fronds ovate-lanceolate in outline, G to

9 inches long, from 1 to 2 inches broad; lobes closely imbricated and recurved, sub-

ci'enate on the lower limb. Gathered in Counemara, Ireland, in 1860.

Blechnum S. anomalum (Moore). Fronds from (3 inches to a foot in length, and

1 inch or a little more                  in breadth ;               lobos very naiTow, distant, attenuated                                                                                                                                               all  the

fronds fertile halfway down, ban-en below. This is certainly a very striking

anomaly, and one that could not have been anticipated by those best acquainted

with the normal type. I at first attributed the change to the situation of its

growtli, the groimd on which it was first found gi'owing being verj' wet ; but I have

since found it on dry hedge-banks and near dry walls, where the condition before

mentioned was altogether absent. Whatever may have been the cause, the change

is very wonderful, and two plants can scarcely be more unlike than the Blechnum

S. iinhricatum and the B. S. anomalum. About tliree-fourths of the plants hitherto

gathered have been constant. It has been found near Todmordeu, in Counemara,

Ireland, in North Wales, and some other places.

Blechnum S. projeclum (Moore). This is a most heterodox varietj^, not at all

conforming to any law of regular development. Fronds from 4 to 10 inches long,

some of them almost entire, being little more than a winged rachis, others with here

and there a projecting lobe beyond the rachidal membrane, and others again with

large projections in lieu of lobes starting from the middle of the frond, others, still,

bearing projections or branches near the terminations in the most irregular manner.

Fertile fronds much longer than the barren, little more than a branched rachis

bearing son witliout the intervention of the usual side lobes. This bears very little

resemblance to the tj'pical form, and is altogether a most singular and gi'otesque

plant. It was gathered near the foot of Ben Lawers, Scotland, and, as described

above, is permanently in'egular in its development.

   Blechnum S. rariabile. Fronds the length of the normal t)rpe, variously fOTcate,

and ramose tenninally ; lobes below very much depauperated for more than half the

length of the frond. Gathered in the Clova Mountains, Scotland.

Bk'chnum S. cauclatum (Moore). Fronds 4 or 6 inches long, and 1 to \\ inch

broad, contracted below, and terminating in a cauda more than one-third the length

of the frond. Gathered in North Wales.

   Blechnum S. diversifrons (Moore). Fronds less than the common type, very
much abbreviated below ; lobes suddenly starting to the full length in the middle
of the fronds, distant. Some of the fronds perfectly linear, being little more than

5 inch in breadth, whilst others, again, have projecting lobes vaiiously distributed

fertile Jfrond being little more than a winged rachis bearing the sori. Found in the

Vale of Todmorden.

Blechnum S. Icitifrom (Moore). Fronds G to 9 inches long, and 2 to 8 inches

broad, distinctly caudate at the end, very coriaceous in texture. Gathered in two

or three places within the Vale of Todmorden.

Blechnum S. brevilohmi (Moore). Fronds from 3 to G inches long, and from

J to 3 inch broad ; lobes rather distant, very short, like blunt triangidar teeth on

each side the rachis. Found in the Vale of Rosseudale.

Blechiium S. ramosum (Moore). Fronds from G to 9 inches long, and from ^ to

1 inch broad, every frond tenninating in large crests or ramose cristations, these

crests again producing other crests. Gathered near Todmorden, also in Connemara,

Ireland.

Blechnum S. heterophyllum (IMoore). Fronds exceedingly varied, some nearly

normal, others depauperated throughout, othei-s, again, having lobes projecting be-

yond the margin intermixed with abbrenated and normal ones. Gathered in the

Vale of Todmorden.

Blechmtm S. erosum. Less than the normal type; fronds very naiTOw; lobes

scarcely developed at all, very much eroded. Gatliered near Todmorden.

Blechnum S. polydactylum (Moore). Less than the nomial type, all the fronds

ending in fingered tenninations. Gathered in Connemara, and also near Todmorden.

Blechnum S. crisjpum (Moore). Rather less than the species j lobes very much

in North Wales.

   Blechnum S. trinerviuyn (Moore). Nearly the size of the species, characterized
by the lowest pair of lobes being developed into miniature fronds. Found in Ire-

land.

   Blechnum S. multifurcatum (Moore). Distinguished by the fronds, both barren
and fertile, being variously branched and furcate at the ends. Gathered near Tod-
morden, in Rossendale, and other places.

   The forms previously mentioned are all distinct from one another, and are beau-
tiful and interesting objects, either for pot culture or fern houses, for Wardian
cases or rockwork in the hardy fernery.

   The following varieties (many of them gathered during the past season) I have
submitted to Mr. Moore, who considers them quite distinct and permanent forms,
and has named them accordingly. Most of them are exceedingly interesting, but

my acquaintance with them is not sufficiently extended to enable me to vouch for

their pennanency.

Observations on the Development of Sjiiapta inhserens.

On some Points of Interest in the Structure and Habits of Sliders.
                         By TuFFEN West, F.L.S.

The object of this paper was stated to be, rather to dissipate erroneoiis opinions

commonly held, by the mention of facts, than to set forth novelties j and by
adverting to some of the many points of interest in the structure and habits of

spiders, to lead to their being regarded with better feelings, and perhaps more

Aattended to by students of Natural History.  more favourable opportimity could

not present itself than such an occasion, when those who professedly study science
are met and listened to by the intellectual and the highly cultivated, with whom rests

the privilege of giving to the age its prevailing tone of thought. The colouring of

spiders is seldom other than rich in its tones ; in making figures of them great dif-
ficulty is experienced in getting colom's of sufficient brightness. That there is an

adaptation of the general tone of colouring to the places inhabited by difierent

spiders is certain ; how far individuals that have arrived at niatmity may be able

on changing their abode to modify their colours is not known, though it is probable,

from the great variety readily observable in this respect, that during growth at any

rate there may be some such adaptive power. The alterations in colour of the

anterior pair of eyes in some spiders, from ruby-red or emerald-green to golden-

yellow, by a perceptible internal motion, are very remarkable, and the means by

which such change is effected deserve careful study. In the instincts of spiders

there is much to interest. The intimate structure of the web of the Diadem-

spiders is known to most as a favourite microscopic object ; the radii in this web

are cords ser\'ing principally for the support of the highly elastic spiral line, with

its drops of viscid material. In the Ciniflonidaj none of the lines forming the

snare are viscid, but insects are quite as eftectually entangled by a pair of tine

double lines, so disposed along a framework as to form very numerous double loops.

The apparatus employed in the construction of these loops is composed of a double

row of spines on the metatarsus of each hind-leg. Some of the tent-forming

spiders iu fine weather make their covering of a very slight texture, but in wet
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  163

gusty weather this is strengthened by additional layers of silk, to which are added

lef^s, ^\'inos, &e., the refuse of their prey. Many spiders manifest proofe of great

atfection for their olfspring : the female Lycosce carry their cocoons constantly about

with them, attached to their spinners ; and when the young are hatched, they affix

themselves to the hairs on the legs, abdomen, &c. of their parent. Pholcus ^^halan-
gioides carries its cocoon in its mouth : Dolomedes mirahilis also, attaching a few

lines fi'oni the spinners as well ; it is only left to take food. The yoimg of many
species of Theridioti live with their parent for some time in a tent constructed by

her, and are, tiU able to shift for themselves, supplied by her with food.

   The structure of many spiders presents nimierous points of interest. In Atyjnis

Sulzeri, our only British yepresentative of the gi'eat Bird-catching Spiders of the
tropics, the jaws are so enormously developed as to render necessary an unusual

elevation of the fi-ont of the ceplialothorax, at the highest part of which, on a short
column, the eyes are seated. This spider constructs a long tube of silk in a burrow

--foi-med in sloping banks, like its relative the "Trap-door spider;" the entrance, how-

ever, is protected in a different way the end of the tube, hanging out in a collapsed

state, lies concealed amongst grass, &c. Several remarkable varieties in the form

of the cephalothorax in species belonging to the genera Walckenaera, Nmem, &c.,

were mentioned, details respecting which will be found at length in the second
part of Mr. Blackwall's work on our native species, shortly to appear under the
auspices of the Ray Society. The exti-aordinaiy difference in size between the
males and females of many spidei-s was alluded to : in some, as the Diadem-spider
of oiu" gardens, the female is three or four times as large as the male, and powerful
in proportion; waywai'd and capricious, she is apt to seek to enjoy by making a
meal of him, hence the disproportionate length of the limbs. Some spiders, how-

ever, especially amongst the smaller species, are gregarious and social.

   Many other interesting circumstances respecting spiders might have been men-
tioned but for the fear of taking up too much time ; as the habits of Argyroneta

aquatica, which, though an air-breathing spider, lives habitually in water, cairying

an extempore diving-bell about with it, and forming a habitation by imprisoning
air at the bottom of the water by fine silken lines. The power of restoring ampu-

tated limbs, of sustaining entire abstinence fi'om food for very lengthened periods,

the probable duration of life, the gi-aceful form of the cocoon.s, were pointed out aa
well worthy of attention.

   Some interesting facts respecting the spiders found in coal-mines were then
alluded to. Some months ago it was publicly stated that'spiders' webs occurred in

the abandoned workings of the Pelton CoUieiy, near Chester-le-Street, county of

Durham ; specimens of the architects of these webs, on being submitted to careful
examination, proved to be Nei-mie errcms, a small spider met with occasionally

about the time of the hay-hai-vest. It appeal's prooable that some individuals
were carried down into the pit with the provender for the hoi-ses, of which about

seventy are constantly employed in the workings. There they have bi-ed freely.

Mr. West found their cocoons in great quantity on the roof of the working, and
obtained some little insight into the nature of their food by finding entangled in a
portion of web, a specimen of the brown plume-moth, one of the midges, and a
number of serrate hairs from a hairy caterpillar. The special point of interest,

however, is that with altered circumstances a modification appears to have taken

place in the instincts of these spiders. In their natural state they are only Imown
as solitary wanderers, making no web of any kind, further than a few scattered lines.
Have their instincts so changed by scantiness of and difficulty in securing prey that
in the coal-mine they become gregarious, and live in large colonies ? from being
neither spinners nor weavers, they take to constructing sheets of web of compara-
tively va.st size. Mr. West saw one 30 feet long by 4 feet 6 wide, hanging from
about the middle of the roof; and Mr. David P. Monison, who lives at Pelton, and
was the first to carefully observe them, has recorded the occurrence of many nearly
as large. Is any alteration in the structure of the spiders taking place ? Are the
optic nerves becoming atrophied, the number of the spinnerets increasing, and the

glands secreting the silk increasing in size ? Here is a fine opportunity afforded

for practically testing Mr. Darwin's theoiy of the origin of species, since we know,

from the time the pit has been worked, that it cannot be long since the first indivi-

duals were taken undergTound, Will the naturalists who may follow us have the
                                                                                                  11*

would have ranked without hesitation as a distinct species, analogous to the Cave

shortly after their removal thence, may have a close connexion with the altered

barometric pressure, and is not without interest.

On the Structure and Growth of the Elementary Parts {Cells) of Livbij Beings,
                    By Professor Lioxel S. Beale, M.B., F.R.S.

   The object of the author was to prove, amongst other points, that all tissues
consist of elementary parts, and that each elementary part (cell) is composed of

--matter in two states germinal matter icithin, and formed material externally. The

only part of the matter of which li^-ing structm-es are composed which possesses

--the power of selecting pabulum, and of transfonning this into various substances

of growing, multiplymg, and foinning tissue is that whicli he terms germinal mat-
ter. The powers of growth of this matter are infinite ; but for the manifestation of
the powers, even in a limited degree, certain conditions must be present. Growth
alwavs occui'S under certain restiictlons. Germinal matter Is composed of spherical

particles, and each of these of smaller spherules. New centres of growth originate

in the spherical masses. Nuclei therefore are not fonned first, and other structures

built up around them ; but nuclei are new centres, originating in pre-existing cen-
tres. All tissue (cell-wall, intercellular substance, &c.) was once in the state of

germinal matter, and resulted from changes occurring in the oldest particles of the

ma-sses of germinal matter. What is tenned the " intercellular substance " corre-

sponds with the cell-wall of a single cell ; and there is no more i-eason for believing
that this structure results from any Inherent power to form matrix, or that the in-
tercellular substance is simply deposited from the nuti-Ient fluid, than for believing
that the capsule of mildew can grow independently of the matter It encloses, or
be fonned by being precipitated from the medium which surrounds it. There is a
pei-iod in the existence of cartilage and allied sti-uctures in which there is no true
" intercellular substance." In nutrition, the inanimate matter permeates the formed
material, and passes into the germinal matter, where it undergoes convei-slon into
this substance. The old particles of gcnnlnal matter become converted into formed
material. Growth, therefore, always takes place from centre to circumference. The
relative proportion of germinal matter and formed material varies greatly in different
elementary parts, in the same elementary part at different periods of its gi-owth, and
in the same tissue imder different circumstances. The more rapidly growth pi'o-
ceeds, the larger the amount of germinal matter produced in proportion to the
fonned material. In all ll\-ing beings, the matter upon which existence depends is
the germinal matter ; and In all living structures the genninal matter possesses the
same general characters, although its powers and the results of its life are so very

different.

  On a Method of Craniometry, with Observations on the Varieties of Form of

                    the Human Skull. By John- Cleland, M.D.

   The author remarked that, notwithstanding the great interest which attached to
the changes of form which the human skull imdergoes in the passage from infancy
to old age, and the varieties of its appearance in different nations, little had been
done as yet to determine what the various superficial appearances indicated as to
the exact form of the skull. It was as if artistic \'iews had been taken of the brain's

habitation from various points, but as yet no ground-plan attempted. And this

apparently resulted from the skuU being studied rather as an object of physiogno-

mical interest than as an anatomical structure. He then pointed out the method

which he had invented for making accurate measurements of the relations of any
series of points on the circumference of the cranium. The instrument consisted of
a framework and bars, by which the vertical and horizontal distance of any spot
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  165

from a fixed point could bo detcmiincd. By means of a short scries of figures it

was thus possible to convey to persons at a distance materials for maliing- perfectly-
accurate measurements of skulls which they had not even seen a drawing of._ The
reader of the paper then went on to show that, although there was great difterence
between savage and cultivated nations in the relative breadth of the cranium and

of the face, yet that, as regarded the proportions in the mesial plane of the front,

middle, and back parts of the head, there was no characteristic difl'erence of size or
shape even betv/een the European and the African. The peculiar appearance of
the skulls of Negroes, Australians, Caribs, &c., compared watli civilized nations,
depended on the way in which the teeth were set, on the development of the fron-
tal ridge to the extent of giving the appearance of a retreating forehead, and on
the manner in which the whole head was balanced on the vertebral column, but not

on diminished size of the anterior lobes of the braiu. Dr. Clelaud pointed out that

one of the most characteristic differences between man and all other mammals con-
sisted in the fact that the human head was balanced in the erect posture, and only
required muscular action to steady it ; while in the chimpanzee and all lower mam-

mals the head was constantly suspended by the action of muscles and elastic
structure. To preserve the balance of the hmnan head, it was necessary that a
change in the joint which articulated it to the neck should accompany the growth
of the individual in such a manner as to tilt the skull fm-ther and further backwards
on the vertebral colunm from infancy to adult age, that the back of the head might
be balanced against the increasing weight of the forehead and face ; and he demon-
strated that such a change really took place. Hence also the feminine head, there
being a smaller development of the face-bones, had a characteristic position in rela-

tion to the neck, distinguishing it from the masculinely developed head. He showed

that in the discussions which had lately taken place to such an extent among anato-

mists as to the degree in which the cerebellum was covered by the braiu proper, in

man and in monkeys, everything depended upon the level on which the skulls
were placed, for that in all mammals the anatomically superior aspect of the cere-

bellum was separated from the cerebrum by the tentorium only, and the real

difference lay, not in any disproportionate addition to the posterior part of the

human ccrebVum, but in this, that the human skidl, together with the contained
cerebrum, was much more curved upon itself in man than in any other animal.

Thus, if the back of a sheep's skull were placed in the same position as the back of

a human skull situated as iu the erect postm-e, the nose of the former woidd be di-

rected upwards.

            On the Action of Lime on Animal and Veqetahle Substances.
                           By John Dayy, M.D., F.liJ. ^r.

   In this paper the author shows by a number of experiments that quicklime ex-
ercises on most aniiiial and vegetable substances a preservative, and not a desti'uc-
tive power according to popular belief; and, consequently, that it may be used with
propiietj^, not for the purpose of consuming dead bodies, but for that of arresting
then- putrefaction and the disengagement of offensive gases.

   Wlien the lime becomes converted by the absorption of carbonic acid into car-
bonate of lime, it no longer po.'sesses the same antiseptic quality : hence, if moist-
ure with atmospheric air be present, the bodies buried in lime will undergo change
and decomposition, but this slowly and gradually, as the lime itself becomes neutra-
lized and inert.

On tJie Blood of the Common Earthworm. By Zows Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Sfc.

   The fluid in question was collected from the cardiac organs, and was carefully

--freed from the perivisceral fliud. It was found to have an alkaline reaction, to

--be coagulable by heat and by nitric acid, very much in the same manner as the

serum of the blood of the mammalia, to contain red coi-puscles (these, taking the
average, about ^^ J-^^th of an inch in diameter), and to yield, when chemically ex-
amined, traces of iron.

   Possessing these equalities, the author has come to the conclusion that this red

fluid is blood, and, as such, that it performs a double fimction, one of nourishing,

the other of aiding, by absorbing oxygen, in aerating the body. Its relation to the

On the Question whether the Hair is subject or not to a Sudden Change of Colour.
                           By John Dayt, M.D., F.R.S. #c.

   The conclusion arrived at by the author respecting^ this question is negative, partly
founded on defective liistorical evidence, none of the instances adduced of sudden
change, according to him, being of a satisfactory kind, and partly on physiological
data, the himian hair, after it has sprimg from the bidb, the gland which secretes it,
being " anorganic," destitute of any chculating fluid, and remarkable for its power
of resisting change when exposed to the action of chemical agents.

   The attempts made to support the popular notion that hair may suddenly, even

in a night or in a shorter space of time, become grey, by reference to change of
colom- of the coats of certain of the mammalia, and of the plumage of certain birds on
the approach of winter and of summer, are objected to on the ground that in all these
instances the change of colom* is, as far as he has been able to ascertain, associated
with a change of hair and feathers, that is, with a new growth, the old being shed.

    Observations on the Encephalon of Mammalia. By E.. Gaenek, F.L.S,

   In this paper the author adverted to the extreme doubt stiU dwelling in the
minds of physicians and physiologists with respect to the fimctions of the different

parts of the brain. He took up the theoiy that the cerebellum is not the organ of

amativeness, as maintained by Gall, but the distributor of the motive impulse de-
scending fi-om the cerebrum. His proofs were derived from comparative anatomy,
and fi'om the development of the cerebellum at difl'erent ages, as well as from a re-

markable case of disease. He also endeavoured to localise the som-ces of its different

kinds of influences, whether they are exerted upon the head, trunk, or limbs, or
in flexion and extension. The cerebellum seems to be as often a separator as a
combiner of cerebral impidse ; for instance, the mofores ocvhrmn are given oft' above

the cerebellar connexion, and we have no power of separate action in these nerves,
whilst it is the reverse in both respects with the abducentes. With respect to

phi'enology, he obsei-ved that its list of facidties and feelings is very complete, whilst
one-half of the convolutions, their supposed seats, do not appear on the upper sur-

face of the brain at all, or influence the form of the skidl. He next endeavoured

to prove the functions of the component parts of the brain, and traced the develop-
ment of the convolutions fi-om the smooth brain of the rodentia to that of the ape
and man. The distinction and description of these folds is not without the pale of
anatomy, and thek consideration forms the transcendental plan of arranging the

Mammalia. He made a few observations on the general form of the cranium.

Females, he thinks, have by no means, comparatively speaking, low foreheads, but
the reverse, at least centrally ; their skull is also more lozenge-shaped, a little pro-

minent at the sides. He thinks men of low or moderate statm-e have commonly

an advantage in cerebral development ; but the convolutions in a small brain are
oftener richer or more numerous and tortiious in their divisions than in the other

case ; and some eminent men have had very small heads. With regard to the boat-

shaped or long-head skull, from before to behind, and the roimder and broader

form, the differences, sometimes perhaps national, maybe in others only individual;

the author thinks that the former variety has in some respects (the exact stiidies
for instance) veiy fi-equently the advantage. Twins have been noticed by the
author, one having the elongated head, the other the broad. In the case above
alluded to of cerebellar disease, it was a cyst without any other lesion of the
encephalon, and locomotion was greatly interfered with, imless the cerebmm was
brought into action ; the abducentes were pai'alysed, the motores not. The paper
was lUusti-ated with life-size photographs of brains of healthy persons of difl'erent

ages, of a woman of a hundred, of a deaf mute, and of idiots and epileptics.

water-system, aud to the blood-system ; and, after enteiin^ at some length into the
anatomy of the parts, concludes his remai-ks with the following summary, giving
the results at which he had arrived, though in some respects they are not to be

considered final.

   First, That the so-called abdommal or visceral chamber, in the Dibranchiate
Cephalopoda, is a veritable venous sinus, formed by the expansion of venous trunks ,:
and that it is provided with proper walls.

   Second, That, apparently, capillary vessels exist, uniting the arterial and venous
branchlets; and that the blood-system is composed of vessels and sinuses with
proper walls, therefore constituting a closed system.

   Third, That the so-called water-system, for the ingress of water fi'om the exte-

--rior, does not exist ; but that the chambers to which this function has been attri-

buted compose a diffused Iridney the glandular appendages in the renal chamber
being for the pui-pose of eliminating peculiarly m-inary matters, while the fluids
pass off througn the agency of the capillaries of the various organs that lie in the

several chambers.
   Fom-th, That a rudimentary absorbent system exists in these animals, the in-

testinal veins assuming, in addition to their own, the function of lacteals, and the
so-called fleshy appendages of the branchial hearts acting, probably, in the capacity

of a general lymphatic system.
   Fifth, That there is no pericardium properly so called.
   Sixth, That the muscular fibre of the systemic heart is of the striated variety,

as is also, apparently, that of the branchial hearts.

   Seventh, That the cephalic arteries and those supplying the fins are provided
vs-ith bulbous muscular enlargements, probably for the purpose of regulating the

flow of the blood.
   Eighth, That the surface of the brain of Octopus vulf/aris exhibits inequalities

resembling rudimentaiy convolutions, and that the pedal nerves arise by double
roots both conditions approximating to the higher standard of the Vertebrata.

                         ;

   Ninth, That the results of analysis of the nervous system corroborate the de-
ductions derived from embryology as to the homological import of the parts.

   The author held that " there is every reason to hope that, in consequence of more

chloroform, the deaths from that agent will disappear altogether, as they have
been manifestly diminishing in proportionate frequency during the last twelve

months, now that these accidents are better understood." His conclusions were

the pidse, as hitherto, those who administer chlorofoi-m should for the futm'e paj

equal attention to the respiration of the patient, and in case of accident direct theix
first attention to it. The coiToborative facts as bearing on his former views, as ex-

--plained at Oxford, which the author wished to submit, were tlie following : 1st.

That from a large number of experiments since published on animals, there is now

no reason to doubt that cardiac syncope is a mere accident. The death arises, as

muscles' in the early stages of the chloroform administration ; and the best means
of 8a\'ing the life of such a patient is founded on that view of such accidents,
namely, by the immediate adoption of such means for resuscitation as artificial

respiration, tracheotomy, with the intermittent ' Faradisation ' electric current, to

imitate or assist respiration. 2ndly. Respiration has its earliest point of departure,

        On tlie Physical and PJu/siolojical Processes involved in Sensation.
                            By J. i). MoBELL, 3I.A., LL.D.

  When an appropriate stimulus is applied to any of the organs of sense, a feeling

is produced in the mind which is termed, in the language of mental science, a sen-

Asation. pin driven into any of the nerves which extend themselves immediately

--under the surface of the shin produces paiu, a ray of light falling on the retina
--produces vision, a sapid substance put into the mouth produces taste, and so forth.

Now it has always been a puzzle amongst mental philosophers to understand how

it is that wo can come to a consciousness of external objects at all. Tlieorics without
number have been fonued, from the time of Plato downwards, to bridge over the

gulf which lies between matter and consciousness, between objects of sense around

us and the fact of sensation within us. This chasm in oiu* Itnowledge we do not
gretend wholly to fill. At the same time, so many facts bearing on the question

  ave been brought to light by the progi-ess of^physical science on the one side and
by pliysiology on the other, and so much has been added by the mental analyst,
likewise from his peculiar point of view, that the distance between the outer world
and our o^vn inner consciousness has been vastly diminished, and the mystery driven
back to that one point of connexion between the brain and the human soul which
no analysis appears likely fully to solve. Let us attempt then to strip away all
that is mixed up with sensation naturally, and all that is added to it by our sub-
sequent mental activity, so as to analyse the bare fact itself and reduce it to its

simplest elements. Looking to the physical and external parts of the process, we
must consider, first of all, what it is that the nerves convey from the v.'orld without to
the mind within. Let us take as an example the sense of hearing, as presenting the

greatest degTee of simplicity. "N^'e knoAV, from the investigation of physical science,

that the sole medium of sound is the atmosphere. Wliero there is no atmosphere,
there can be no sound; and Vv'hei'e the atmosphere is perfectly si ill, perfect silence
is the necessary residt. The real cause of sound, therefore, exlenialty considered,

is found in the motion of the atmosphere ; and the variations in tlie acuteness or gTa-

vity of soimd, we knov/ by experiment, arise from the greater or less rapidity of the
oscillations. The deepest note which the human ear appears capable of perceiving as a

continuous sound is that produced by sixteen oscillations in a second; the acntcst,
that which is produced by about 48,000 oscillations in the same time. The differences
in the quality of sounds arise, in like manner, from the pcculiarway in which the atmo-
sphere is aftected by the object tliat sets it in motion, and the corresponding pecu-

liarity of the atmospheric waves tliat reach tlie ear. What we really sensize, there-

fore, through the ear is simply the motion of the atmosphere, and nothing more.

The human ear is an apparatus beautifully formed for receiving the vibrations on
which all sound depends, and the auditoiy nerve conveys them, in some manner,
to the sensorium. With regard to the way in which this latter effect is brought
about we have as yet veiy little insight. The soft texture of the nerves, and the
manner in which they are imbedded in the surrounding materials, would naturally

suggest a total inaptitude for propagating vibrations in the ordinary sense of that
term. It seems more probable that the flow of life through the body is accom-

panied M'ith a constant thrill and movement in every part of the nervous sj^stem,
forming what is technically termed the canasfhcsis, or common sensibility ; so that
the outward oscillations do not so much originate wholly new vibrations as enter

into conflict with the nervous action already going on, and give it that peculiar de-
termination which is necessary to create any given sensation in the mind. This is,
 perhaps, as far as it is possible to go in our analysis of the physical process. IIow

the Tibration of the air comes into conflict with the living thrill of the uen'e,. and

how the result of this conflict reaches the mind, wc are at present unable to com-

prehend. It is one of those hidden secrets of nature which science has not yet been

able to unfold. Turning from the sense of hearing to that of sight, a precisely simi-

lar analysis holds good. Here the vibrating medium is not the atmosphere, but a

universally diff'used ether which is set in motion by what are colled luminous bodies.

Just as atmospheric oscillations form the external cause, and sound the internal

result, in the case of hearing, so in sight the oscillations of the light-bearing ether

form the outward condition, and colour, in all its various shades, the inward result.

Here, accordingly, as before, it is simply motion in natui'e giving rise to motion in

the nerve-world with which we have immediately to do in vision ; while, to keep

up the analog}-, it is the difierence in the rapidity of the oscillations that creates all

the infinite variations of hue. The red rays, it is calculated, require 458 billions

of oscillations in a second, the violet rays 727 billions, and all the other colovurs and

shades of the spectrum some intermediate number. That the phenomena of sound

and sight spring physiologically out of particular states of the corresponding nerves

is clear from the fact that pressure on the eye, or any artificial irritation, produces

the perception of light as strongly as the normal impiilses derived from the vibrating

ether, and that any artificial excitement of the auditory nerve will produce noise in

--the head. Ghost-seeing often arises in the same way that is, when the conditions

of sight are brought about by the nerves being aflijcted through some other than

the ordinary and legitimate stimidi. Whatever, in a word, can aftect the regular

vital movements of the nerves, and put them into a condition at all similar to that

produced by the proper external stimuli of sensation, ^vill, of necessity, bring about

Wesimilar phenomena of consciousness.  come next to the sense of feeling. This

sense comprehends two appai-enlly distinct series of sensations, namely, those of

touch, properly so called, and those of heat. With regard to the latter, it has been

pretty well established that the phenomena of heat originate in the oscillations of

a subtle fluid similar to that of light. The sensation of heat maj', therefore, be
brought under tlie law of motion just as much as that of light or hearing, and may
be regarded in every respect as analogous. The phenomena of touch, we know, are

produced by impact in various ways ; and it is just in accordance with the nature

-- --of that impact, whether harder or softer more rapid or more slow that the result-
Aing sensations are deteiiniued.
                                  blow is a sudden afl'ection produced by the rapid

motion of some object against a considerable surface of the bodj'. Pressure is a

Amore continuous affection of the same kind.  prick is the motion of some object

against one minute point of the skin. If the act of pricldng be repeated rapidly, it

produces a feeling of burning, and, if it be very soft, at the same time of itching.

An extremely light and gentle motion over the body produces tickling. In every

instance the peculiar kind of sensation is determined by the natm-e of the motion

and the consequent impact. The only two senses left, accordingly, are those of taste

and smell. In both these cases the process by which the nerves are affected is of

a chemical nature. The substances received upon the surface of the tongue or the

internal membrane of tlie nostril are subjected to the action of saliva or mucus, and,

being thus dissolved, produce a chemical action on the nerves, which gives rise to

the phenomena of taste and smell. All chemical action, however, arises, as far as

it can yet be ascertained, from certain relative movements in the ultimate atoms of

bodies, and it is these movements which, in the case of taste and smell, really give

rise to the peculiar sensations so designated. One striking proof of this is, that a

similar atomic action can be produced by magnetism, and that various tastes, par-

ticularly that of phosphorus, can be produced by the introduction of magnetic plates

into the mouth ; thus most obviously proving that the phenomena of taste are reaUy

produced, like those of heat, by the motion of certain minute particles, whether of

some magnetic fluid or of anytliing else, when subjected to chemical action. By

these atomic movements the nerves are affected, just as they are affected by the

infinitesimal oscillations of light and heat, so that the same law holds good through-

out, and thus enables us to connect the phenomena of sensation imiversaUy with

motion as its immediate external antecedent and exciting cause. Looking now
from the physical side of sensation to the mental, we shall find that the view _we

have just taken solves or dissipates many of the difliculties in which the question

has always seemed to be involved. First of aU, it makes the external cause and
1:70 REPORT 1861.

tiie effect upon the nervous system quite homogeneous. Outward motion is the
 cause, inward motion is the effect. Instead of having the solid forms of the out-
 ward world standing as it were face to face with the nervous energy, and being
obliged to consider how it is possible for two things so entirely heterogeneous to

come into so close a state of mental action and reaction, we have now the whole

problem reduced to two developments of motion : first, motion in the fluids around
us; and secondly, a certain determination given, by their means, to the atomic

movements or vibrations of the neiTes. How the movements of the nerve-force

are converted into those of mind-force we cannot say, any more than we can explain
how it is that mechanical motion is converted into heat, or vice versa ; but the out-
ward phenomena are traced, in the way we have now indicated, as far back to the

inward consciousness as seems possible, without breaking through the last film of
separation that divides the conscious from the unconscious world. Secondly, the

theory we have adopted enables us to di-aw a clear line of separation between sen-
sation (properly so called) and all the subsequent mental phenomena which attach
themselves to it. Thus, taking the sense of hearing, we can now easily strip away
every possible association which connects itself with what M'O hear, and understand

that the sensation of hearing itself simply implies the nei-vous effect of certain atmo-

spheric vibrations, and nothing more. Taking the sense of sight, we can at once

negative the possibility of sensizing size, shape, thickness, distance, or any other of

the properties of bodies : all we see sensationally is colour, as being the direct result
in the consciousness of the luminous vibrations which affect the optic ner\'e. And
so in like manner does every sense confine itself to one single and peculiar series of
phenomena, which are not by any means to be confounded with the mental acts

and associations aftei-wards connected -with them. Thirdly, the same theory in-
troduces vmity into the entire sphere of sensational phenomena. The whole of
these phenomena are reduced to the single principle of motion, as the invariable

antecedent ; this motion, as it exists in external nature, exciting a corresponding
action in the nerves, and then, through the nerve-force, affecting the mind. Thus,

then, we find, by the combined aid of physics and physiology, (1) that man pos-

sesses a nervous system pervaded by a force which can pass freely from everj' point

in the human system to the centre, and fi-om the centre to eveiy point in the cu.'-

cumference (2) that he is placed in a universe palpitating with countless millions
                                                      ;

of vibrations, of which vibrations the nerves of the different sense-organs are directly
susceptible; (3) that the whole connexion which the mind has, or can possibly
have, with the external world is fonued by the motion of the fluids around us, or
the motion of the particles of bodies that come into chemical contact vrith the
nerves (4) that the material universe, therefore, makes itself known to us entirely

                                ;

through the medium of motion (.5) that this motion expresses itself in the nervous
                                                                                                                                                 ;

system by modifying the regular vital action which is always going on there ; and

(lastly) that this modification of the nerve-force manifests itself to our conscious-

mness the varied phenomena of what we term sensation. Thus the world com-

municates with the consciousness wholly through motion as a link of connexion,
and out of the experiences thus foi-med our whole inteUigence is subsequently built

up by the laws of mental development.

                  On Prison Dietary in India. By Dr. Mouatt.

   The author commenced by giving a brief histoiy of the successive dietaries in
use in Bengal, and then proceeded to detail the residts of an inquiry which had

been made into the sanitary influences of the existing dietaiy. He stated subse-

quently the principles that should guide the formation of a prison dietary, applied
those principles to the dietary in use, and concluded by suggesting the remedies
necessary to correct the eiTors of that scale of food, without losing sight of the pri-

mary objects it is intended to fulfil, namely, to maintain the health of prisoners at
the lowest possible cost to the State, so as, on the one hand, to avoid improper in-
dulgences, and, on the other, to secure a sufficiency of food to preserve health and
prevent disease. Facts and figures were produced to show connexion between the
diet-scales and the mortality from diseases most neai-ly associated -ndth the func-

--tions of digestion dysenterj^, diarrhoea, scurvy, phthisis, and cholera, of which the

connexion was believed to be veiy doubtful. ' The dietetic value of the chief arti-

cles used as food in the prisons of Bengal was given on the authority of the analysis
propounded by Dr. Forbes Watson, and four different scales of diet were recom-
mended : 1, for Bengalese and Assamese ; 2, for natives of Behar, the North-west
Provinces, and the Pimjab ; 3, for Coles, Sontals, GaiTows, and Hillmen generally;
and 4, for Mughs and Chinamen. The last-named were fond of cats, dogs, rats, or
any animal food, and mere vegetable diet never satisfied them. The scales referred
to were all for long-term convicts, and were stated to be the minimum to maintain
health and strength.

 On the Existence and Arrangement of tlie Fovea Centralis Eetince in the Eyes
                         of Animals. By Prof. H. Mullee.

   The fovea centralis and macula lutea have generally been regarded as a peculiarity
of man and qufidrumana. The physiological dignity of the spot, and the power to
see an object at the same time with the two fovese, seemed to secm-e to the organ
of vision of these beings an exceptionally high position. But this is not true. I can
say, for the moment, that the chameleon and at least many birds which possess the
apparatus for optic accommodation so highly developed are also endowed with the
delicate nervous apparatus represented by the fovea and the thicker parts surround-
ing it. The extent of siu-face which presents this peculiar organization is found
sometimes so great, that a very considerable part of the retina may be compared to
the macula lutea of the human eye. There is in this part of the retina of these
animals the peculiar arrangement of the bimdles of nerves, which ai'e ciuved roimd,
so that many fibres come into, but none pass over it. There is the accumulation
of ganglion-cells, which form several layers in the circumference of the fovea.
There is the peculiar conformation of the external layer of the retina, in which the
elements sensible to light are thinner and longer than elsewhere ; so that in the

fovea this layer, necessary for the first reception of light, alone is thicker, while
the other layers are attenuated. There is, finally, the oblique course of the fibres
in the granular layer, which put in communication the enormous quantity of sen-
sible elements in and next the fovea with the ganglion-cells in the neighboiu'hood.
It is at the same tune very interesting, that the two species of radial fibres in the
retina of which I treated ('On the Retina,' 1856, p. 72), namely, of nervous and
connective tissue, have in those animals a different course--in the granidar layer
the one sort running obliquely, the others rimning perpendicularly to the external

surface of the granular laj^er. The fovea centralis is ordinarily to be found in the
eyes of bii'ds next to the posterior pole of the sclerotica, but sometimes excentri-

cally therefi'om towards the temporal part of the eyeball. In owls the excentricity

is so great, that a common act of vision in the two fovese is very reconcileable with

the position of the eyes in these animals. In some mammalia, besides quadrumana,
there exists at least an area centralis which approaches the an-angement of the
yellow spot ; the course of the vasa centralia, wanting in birds, at the same time

becomes more like the human eye."

          Physiological Researches on the Artificial Production of Cataract.

                          By B. W. EiCHAEDSON, M.D., M.A.

   In the course of his remarks the author said that syrup of sugar injected into the
circulation of a frog would produce cataract, and he exhibited a nimiber of living

frogs in which he had produced the disease by this means. The same injection

produced the same result on both guinea-pigs and rabbits. An injection of com-
mon salt also acted like sugar, the only difference being that it produced harder

cataract. If any of the soluble salts of the blood were present in excess, they
would produce this condition. In 1838, at a meeting of that Society, Sir David
Brewster had said that cataract was caused by the disan-angemeut of the fibres of

the lens of the eye, and his theoretical notion had now turned out to be quite cor-

rect. In reply to a number of questions put to him, Dr. Richai'dsou said that the.
--172 REPORT 1861.

lens might be cataractons without the patient being quite blind. Where a patient
laboured under diabetes he had never seen a perfect lens. Von Gra3fe had demon-
strated that one case out of every four of diabetes was accompanied wilh visible
cataract. He (Dr. Richardson) had never failed in producing cataract in an animal
by the means he had described. If they would give him an animal and the mate-
rials, he would tell them when the total eclipse of the eye of the animal would
take place almost to a second. Occasionally, when sugar was present in the blood,
the retina became aflected. Frogs fed on sugar woidd become cataractic, but in
animals that had active digestive organs the condition was not so easily produced.
He had fed an animal on sugar for six weeks without producing any marked effect.
After he had produced cataract in an animal, he could cm-e it. The cataract he

produced in the frog and the cataract in the limnan subject were the same, with

this exception, that in the human subject the exciting cause, the production of
sugar, was constantly going on, whereas in the frog experimented on the eflect was

temporary.

Physiological Researches on Resuscitation. By B. "W. Eichaedsou-, M.D., M.A.

   The modes of death to which alone the author's remarks applied were such as
involved no organic lesion, and had not extended to putrefaction or coagadation of
the blood ; and by death he meant cessation, not of respiration only, but also of the
heart's action. As to coagulation of the blood, 700 observations had convinced him

--that it did not usually take place for twenty minutes after death. The modes of

resuscitation he dwelt upon were 1, artificial respiration ; 2, galvanism; 3, injection

--into blood-vessels ; and 4, artificial ckculation. Amongst the conclusions, stated as

the residts of many experiments, were these : that artificial respiration is useless if
the heart's action has ceased ; that the heart's action may be prolonged by artificial re-
spiration in a temperature of 130 degrees, where it would cease at once in an ordinaiy
temperature ; that when the heart has ceased to act in these cases, the right side of
the organ is full of blood, and the left nearly empty ; that then the column of blood

which should pass from the right side to the left is broken, the hydrostatic law is
violated, the two sides of the heart are in opposition, and the right side has not

--only to get over the weight of the column of blood, but also the contractile power

of the left side a thing it cannot do ; that galvanism .applied in any way to stimu-

late the heart hastens the cessation of theheart's motion, and that galvanism cannot be

applied in any known way to resuscitate without injury ; that injection of water at

130° Fahr. into the large blood-vessels of a dog will produce the muscular actions
of life an hour after the muscles liave been rendered toiitid by prolonged galvanism,
and two hom-s and a half after death ; that this result, however, is not useful for

the real recovery of life ; and that the great desideratum now is some simple me-

chanical means of ellecting artificial circulation. Dr. Richardson showed an appa-
r.atus of his own by which artificial circulation can be brought about,- but not,
imfortimately, without opening arteries too large to make the process useful. In
cases of suspended animation, lie recommended that if any respiration, however
feeble, exists, no attempt should bo made to interfere with it; that the patient
should be placed in a diy atmosphere, .at 130° of heat ; that artificial respiration

should always be set up where no breathing exists, as it is possible there may still be

some cardiac motion ; that electricity and galv.anism are worse than useless ; and that

injection of arterial blood into arteries might be useful in many cases, if such blood

could be obtained.

             On tlie Cenncal and Occipital Vertchrce of Osseous FisJies.
By Chaeles Eobeetson, Demonstrator of Anatomy in the University of Oxford.

   The author gave a description of the cer^acal vertebrfe and their .appendages in
a few osseous fishes not before described, and important in considering the vertebral

theory. He then proceeded to show tliat the same kind of modifications are met

with in the grouping of the elements of the occipital segment of fishes and in the
skull, as in the vertebral column the same elements are not invariably present, but

--are subject to variations. The conclusions an-ived at were these : 1. The partition-

      On the Connexion between the Functions of Respiration and Digestion.
                  By George Robinson, M.D., Newcastle-on-Tyne.

In a paper " On the Nature and Source of the Contents of the Fcetal Stomach,"

communicated to the Royal Society of London in 1847, and published in the

* Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science ' in the same year, I described

certain observations on the contents of the stomach in fcetal and newly bom rab-

bits, which seemed to me to prove the existence of a direct connexion between the

function of respiration and the secretion of the gastric juice. I am not aware that

the vital law thus indicated has yet received much attention either from physiolo-

gists  or medical practitioners                                                                                                             and as   I believe  it to be  one  of  some  importance                                     in

the animal economy, I hope to be excused for now desiring to submit it to the con-

mysideration of this Association. The facts which, in                                                                                                                     opinion, establish this prin-

ciple are very simple, and can readily be examined by any one.

Immediately before birth, the stomach of the foetal rabbit contains a dark-green,

viscid, highly albuminous liquid, which scarcely affects litmus-paper; but after

respiration has been established a few hours, the same substance is found firmly

coagulated, and the whole contents of the stomach are sh'ongly acid. This for-

mation of acid gastric juice does not take place immediately after birth; for I have

then observed the lungs inflated, and the contents of the stomach nevertheless

--unchanged. The process of respiration must continue for a certain time a few
--hours before the coagulation of the albuminous matter by an acid gastric secretion

is accomplished.

   The chemical changes therefore which occur in the stomach of the rabbit conse-

quent on the pei-fonnance of respiration, and the veiy circumstance of a certain in-
terval elapsing between the commencement of the oxygenation of the blood and

the appearance of the proper gastric juice, seem to me conclusive as to the connexion

between the latter function aud the former.

  Now assuming for the present the con-ectness of this principle, some interesting

questions arise. If the secretion of the acids of the gastric juice be thus dependent
                                                                                        _

on the oxygenation of the blood, to what extent is the formation of the other ani-

mal acids also influenced by the action of respiration I' And if a certain degree of

oxygenation of the blood be requisite for the natural secretion of gastric juice, will

not defective oxygenation impau- the quality of the latter liquid, and so tend to
connect some fonns of indigestion with the imperfect performance of respkation?

In this way, the improved appetite and digestion which we often obsei-ve to follow
change of residence may really be a direct eftect of the more complete purification

and oxygenation of the blood by increased exercise and the inhalation of a piu-er

air.

   I can only hope that these and similar questions will be studied by competent
chemical physiologists, and that the residt of their researches will be still further

to establish the mutual relation and dependence of the great functions of life ; for

at the present time, when physiological and pathological inquiries are so intensely
localized, it becomes peculiarly important to recall to mind the essentially compound

unity of the living animal.

illush'ate principles of first-rate importance. He gave a number of details as to

the osteological, digestive, circulatory, generative, and nervous systems of the In-
sectivora, dwelling especially upon the instances of variability of organs not sub-
sement to special habits whicli this family furnished, and upon the variations to
be found in individuals belonging to the same species. Referring to Gratiolet's
classing the Lemurs amongst the Insectivora, Dr. KoUeston said that this arrange-
ment might seem to be justified by the fact that the Lemm-s differed from other
Quadnimana by their non-possession of the hippocampus minor and of an over-
lapped cerebellum, and by their possession of a large olfactory lobe. In these points,
also, the higher apes resembled the himian species, whilst differing from the lower

members of theu- own family.

On the ITomolor/ies of the Lobes of the Liver in Mammalia.
           By Professor Eolleston, M.D., F.B.S.

   In descriptions of the internal anatomy of rare animals, it is usually easy, even
without the aid of figures, to compare tlie aecoimts given of the an-angement of
their organs with the arrangement of similar structures in animals more familiar
to us. To this statement the descriptions given of the lobes and lobules of a
multifid liver form an exception ; and the pui-port of this paper is to furnish the
zoologist with a convenient and readily appbcable sjstem of nomenclature for

the several divisions which the liver may be found to present in the mammalian

series.

   The umbilical view of the foetus, preserved for us in the adult in the so-called
"suspensory ligament," furnishes us with our first landmark. The lobe to which

--it is attached we may call the " suspensory lobe (' it is veiy commonly, though

not in the human subject, trifid, the suspensory ligament having one lobule to

its left subequal with a second to its right, which is bounded in that direction
by the cystic fossa where the gall-bladder exists, and this second lobide, the
" suspensoiy central," having the third lobule h'ing upon its right, between the
indentation (when it exists) for the gall-bladder and the fi"ee right edge of the

entire lobe.

The " suspensory lobe" overhangs the two other lobes into which the mamma-

lian liver is divisible. To the left it overhangs a lobe which is very rarely if at all
deeply incised or indented; this lobe we would call the "left lobe." The lobe

which it overhangs to the right is very frequently lobulated somewhat complexlj'.

This "right lobe" is di^·isible into three secondary lobides, the "superior right

lobule," the " right kidney lobule," and the " lobulus Spigelii." The " superior

right lobule" is frequently in relation -ndtli the pylorus, and in some animals, a.s

the rabbit, is deeply excavated for the lodgment of that portion of the stomach

immediately overhung itself by the right subdivision of the suspensory lobe, it

again overlies the "right kidney lobule," which is very commonly either deeply

fissured or greatly excavated for the reception of the organ after which it is named.

The "superior right lobide" and the "right kidney lobule" are often found to

be fused into one mass in animals such as the hedgehog, Erinacetis europce-its, and

the long-eai-ed bat, Plecotus auritus, in which they are usually distinct. Lastly,

we have the "lobulus Spigelii," which (with two exceptions in the Marsupial

series, viz. the Phalaiif/ista vt/Ipina and the Macrojyiis r/iffmifeits) we have foimd to

be more directly in connexion with, and sessile upon, the "right kidney lobide " than

upon any other poi"tion of the liver. The bile-duct and the afferent blood-vessels

of the liver pass in front of the origin of this lobule. It may effloresce into two

recesses distally and to the left, one of which may pa«s before and the other
E
  ehind the cardiac end of the stomach, as in 3Iiis decununuis ;  or it may give off a

process near its origin and towards the right, which may intei-pose itself between

the "right kidney lobule" and the "superior right lobule," as in the shrew,

Sorex vidr/aris.

In the nomenclataire suggested by M. Duvernoy (Ann. des Sciences XatureUes,

ser. ii. tom. iv.), the left division of the suspensory lobe is named "lobe principal
gauche ;" but its diminished proportions, as compared with those of the " left lobe"

in some of the Insectivora and lower Quadrumana, incline us to consider it as

wholly lost in such livers as those of man and the iiuninants, and to assign it, when

it does exist, to the "suspensory lobe." Without, however, positively pronouncing

upon its homology, convenience of description induces iis to name it " left suspen-

sory lobule."

   It is proposed, then, to speak of the liver as divisible into three principal lobes,

--two of which frequently admit of further subdivision at the most, however, into

not more than three lobides each.

        On the Influence of the Season of the Year on the Human System,
                           By Edwakd Smith, M.D., F.B.S.

  _ The author said that he only proposed to give a brief outline of a series of observa-
tions he had made upon himself, and to mention one or two deductions he had
drawn from these observations. The observations he had made were to show tha

--variations of the vital actions in the human system, and his two principal inquiiies

referred the one to the respii-atory fimctions, and the other to the elmiination of

nitrogen. In reference to respiration, the amoimt of carbonic acid evolved varied

from day to day with the cycle of the seasons. He had found that there was a

definite variation in the amount of vital action proceeding within the body at

the diiferent periods of the year, and that this followed a well-marked course.

Thus, at the heguuiing of June a fall commenced, and this continued and pro-
gressively increased through June, July, and August, until the commencement of
September, when the lowest point was attained. After this period, in October an
upward tendency was manifested, and it continued through October, November,
and December, mitU January, when a point was attained from which there was

little change in January, February, and March. In April and May the amount

of carbonic acid evolved was yet fm-ther increased, imtil the point was reached
whence he started. The extreme amount of change obseiTed was a loss of three

gi-ains of carbonic acid per horn- from the commencement of June to September

and the extreme quantities recorded were in May 10-26 grains, and at the lowest

period between 6 and 7 gi-ains. The rate of respiration, the quantity of air inspired,
and the quantity of carbonic acid exhaled, followed the rule he had explained. It
had been proved by several series of experiments that the rate of pulsation was in-
creased by heat, whilst the rapidity of pulsation was the reverse of the rate of respi-
ration. With reference to the evolution of niti'ogen, the conditions were the opposite

of those of the elimination of carbonic acid. The general results he had anived at
were, that there was a greater amount of fluid evolved in the summer months than
in the winter. The cai-bonic acid evolved decreased with the increase of tempera-
ture. On a sudden increase of temperature there was a large decrease of vital

action, and on a fall of temperatm-e there was an increase of vital action. The
greatest gi-owth of animals would occur at that period of the year when there was
the largest amount of \'ital action ; and in this respect they were connected with the

vegetable kingdom. He believed that it was a fact with regard to the gi-owth of

childi-en, that they gi-ew at a greater r.ate in spring than in winter. From facilities
which the Registrar-General had afforded him, he had ascertained that a much
larger number of those children boi-n at the latter part of the summer died within

a year of birth than took place amongst those born at other periods of the year.

The children bom in the winter and spring periods were less subject to disease,
and in all probability had stronger constitutions than those bom in the summer

season. Tbese variations in the increase and decrease of the vital power of the
system seemed to him to be the origin and the cure of diseases, especially those
that were chronic. All epidemics to a large extent, in whatever part of the world

they occurred, took place at the period when the human system was decreasing in

yital a,ction. This rule applied to cholera especially, which generally attained its

 On the Action of iJie EustacJilan Tube in Man, as demonstrated hi/ Dr. Politzer's

                           Otoscope. By J. Toynbee, F.li.S.

    From the time that the celebrated anatomist, Eustachius, in the 16th century,
 discovered the tube leading from the cavity of the fauces to that of the tympanum,

 this Eustachian tube has been usually described as constantly open, and the air in
 the two cavities has consoquentlv been looked upon as constantly continuous.
 Although Mr. Wharton Jones in l841, and ]SI. Ilyrtl in 1845, spolce of the faucial
 orifico of the Eustachian tube as Laving " the property of a weak valve opening
 either way," their opinion did not alter the views entertained by physiologists re-
specting the functions of the Eustachian tube, and its constantly open condition was
 considered essential to the due performance of the function of hearing.

    In the year 1853 I laid before the Royal Society a paper, the object of which was
to demonstrate, _^rs%, that the faucial orifice of theEustachian tube is always closed,
except momentarily during the act of deglutition or when au" is forcibly blown
through it; secotuVy, that the Eustachian tube is opened by the muscles of the
palate, the tensor and levator palati; tJtirdli/, that, contrary to the preconceived
opinion of physiologists that " if the Eustachian tube is closed tJie hearing is lost

at once," in order that the function of liearing may be duly performed, it is abso-

lutely requisite for tlie Eustachian tube to be closed, otherwise tlie sonorous nudu-

lations, which ought to be confined to the tympanic cavity in order that they may

be concentrated upon the mcnibrana fenestra rotunda', are lost in the fauces, and tbe
soimds from the fauces also enter the tympanum and produce the most distressing-

discord.

    In proof that the faucial orifice of the Eustachian tube remains closed after the
act ot swallowing, the experimenter has but to swallow some saliva while the

nostrils are closed by the linger and thumb : a sensation of pressure is produced
in each ear, which disappears onlj' when the act of swallowing is again performed

without the pressure of tbe nose. It is also well Iniown that unless the act of de-
glutition be frequently practised during the descent in a diving-bell, so that the Eu-

stachian tube may be opened and air allowed to enter the tympanum, great deafness

and a feeling of pressure in the ears are produced. Further, in cases where the

membrana tympani is lax, it is seen to move outwards when air is blown into the

tympanic cavity, and it returns to its natural position only on the act of swallowing
being performed.

   In order to demonstrate this function of the Eustachian tube, and also to dia-
gnose its condition in disease, I suggested the use of an otoscope, consisting of an
elastic tube about eighteen inches long and a quarter of an inch in diameter, each
end being tipped with an ebony tube. Upon the introduction of one end of this tube
into the ear of the experimenter, while the other is placed in that of the person

experimented upon, it the latter distends the tympanum by a forcible attenipt at an
expu'ation while the nose and mouth ai'e closed, the air is heard to enter and to distend
the tympanum, and the cavity remains distended until the act of swallovdng ia
perfonned, when the diinn is heard to recede as the air makes its egress.

   The views on the physiology of the Eustachian tube advanced by me before the

Royal Society ha\ang attracted the attention of Dr. Politzer of Vienna, that gen-
tleman performed a series of experiments with the object of testing their accuracy.
The result is that Dr. Politzer came to the same conclusion as I had done, and he
invented a simple and ingenious instrument, by means of which the action of the
Eustachian tube can be seen. This instrument, which I have called Dr. Politzer's
otoscope, consists of a rounded portion of cork or India rubber, about an inch and a
half long, and about half an inch in diameter ; in the centre of this is a glass tube
about two lines in diameter, which externally is disposed in the fonn of an elbow.

When used, the rounded and free portion of the cork or uidia rubber is moistened,

and introduced into the external meatus, care being taken that it fits, so as to pre-
vent the outer air from passing between the instrument and the walls of the meatus.

When this has been accomplished, a drop of water is allowed to enter the tube so

as to fill half the elbow, and to be on the same plane in each portion of it. The

person experimented upon is now to close the nose with his finger and thumb, and
(the mouth beino^ shuy to force air into the tpnpanmn. Immediately this takes

place, the water is seen to descend in the inner portion of the elbow and to ascend

an the outer portion. The fing-er and thumb are now to be removed from the nose,
when no movement of the water is observed to take place in either elbow ; but as

soon as the act of swallowing is perfonued, the water is observed to retm-n to its

original position, the dnmi having receded on the opening of the Eustachian tube.

On the Physiological and Medicinal Properties of SaljyJiate of Aniline, and its
        Use in the Treatment of Chorea. By Dr. J. Tuenbcxl, Liverpool.

   The author obseiwed that medical men had not acquired a knowledge of new re-
medies commensm-ate with the improvements which had been made in other branches
of medical science. The progress of organic chemistry had brought to light many
new bodies worthy of investigation, and there coidd be little doubt that many of
them would, if their properties were examined, be found to prove remedies of utility.
The artificial alkaloids were a numerous class, and from their resemblance in che-

mical constitution to the vegetable allraloids, it might reasonably be expected that

some of them should have powerful and useful properties. He had been led to

make trial of the sidphate of the artificial alkaloid, aniline, in cases of nei"\'ous dis-
order, and had ti-eated with it successfully six cases of chorea, or St. Vjtus's dance.

In regard to its physiological action, he stated that aniline appeared to act directly
on the nervous system as a sedative. The most remarkable ettect, however, which
it produced was a transient alteration in the colour of the skin and lips, which be-
came of a bluish hue ; and this he attributed to oxidation of the aniline and the

formation of a colouring-matter in the blood. As a therapeutic agent, he expressed
the opinion that it would be foimd by the profession to be a valuable new remedy.

       GEOGEAPHY AND ETHNOLOGY.

       On the Connexion hetiueen Ethnology and Physical Geography.

       By Joim Ceavvfued, F.B.S., President of the Section.

It has been the practice of my predecessors to open the meetings of this Section

by a short address, and I gladly follow their example, choosing for my subject one

--which I hope you will consider suited to the occasion the connexion between eth-

nology and physical geography. JMan will be found savage, barbarous, or civilized,

in proportion to the quality of the race to which he belongs, and to the physical

character of the coimtry ia which his lot has been cast. Beginning with the con-

ditions least favourable to his progi-ess, and rising to those which are most auspi-

cious, I proceed at once to illustrate this pi-inciple by a few examples : such a step

--may perhaps be useful in showing the scope of om- science the Imowledge of the

earth considered as the habitation of man. Mere intemperance of climate, inde-

pendent of any other obstacle, is sufficient to prevent man from making any advance
towards civilization, and to hold him permanently in the savage state. The con-

dition of the iahabitants of the Arctic, sub-Arctic, Antarctic, and sub-Antarctic
regions are examples. The Esqiumaux is the most strildng : dwelling where the

year consists but of one day and one night, where snow and glaciers are substituted

for the gi-een earth, where no plant yielding food for man vnW grow, and, save the
dog, no domestic animal live, advancement is impossible. The Esquimaux alone

can live in such a region, and this only as himters and fishemien, leading a nomadic

life over its vast surface. Under such adverse circiunstances, we only wonder at
the progress they have made in the arts, with stones, bones, sinews, skins, and

drift-wood their sole appliances.

   There are lands, indeed, which, from mere inclemency, seem incapable of sup-

porting human life at all, and which seem never to have been inhabited. The

islands of Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla within the Arctic, and New Shetland within

the Antarctic Circle, are examples, Even more temperate Iceland had no abori-

France and England.

myI take  next illusti'ation from a coimtry of a very different character, Austi-a-

lia. The gi'eat mass of this continent lies in a temperate region, with well-marked

seasons, and the rest in a tropical one. The climate of that portion of it which has

been tested is one of the finest in the world, and the land is not encumbered sv-ith

forest, always so formidable an obstacle to the early advancement of civilization.

With these exceptions it possesses no peculiar advantages : it has no great range of

high moimtains, and hence no great navigable rivers, while, from the same cause,

a vast extent of its sm-face is an arid desert of sand. Compared to its area, it has

·but a small extent of coast-line, because little indented by gulfs, bays, or inlets, and

hence it is wanting in facUity of intercommunication. It contained no native plant

available to cultivation for human food, and no native animal amenable to domes-

tication, the dog excepted, of small value iu such a climate. Under such dis-

couragements, and without communication with strangers, any advancement iu

civilization woidd have been impossible, even had its native inhabitants been of

the most highly-gifted races of man. Mentally and physically they are, on the

contrary, among the feeblest, consisting of hordes of black, ill-formed, unseemly

naked savages, possessed of no aiis, except those which enabled them to maintain

a bare existence from the spontaneous productions of the earth or the water.

Equal in extent to China, the whole population of Austi-alia did not, probably,

exceed in number that of a single town in that empire. Little more than seventy

years ago this distant and unpromising land was selected as a place of pimishment

for English felons ; in due time it was found excellently well adapted for the sheep,

although no native animal of the family it belongs to existed in it, and chiefly by

its help the population of the sti'angers rose to half a million. Ten years ago it

was found to be rich in gold, a fact which the natives had not discovered ; and if

they had, the precious metal woidd have been of no more value to them than the

quartz rock which contains it. The gold has doubled the ci^-ilized population, and,

with the wool of the sheep, is exported, to the enrichment of the colonists and the

world at large, to the yearly value of fifteen millions. At even less than its recent

--rate of increase, Australia will, in a centiu-y's time, contain a population equal to

that of the United Kingdom, a wealthy, proud, and formidable nation of Anglo-

Saxons--mighty conquerors and troublesome neighbours.

The ti'opical Andaman Islands, iu the Gulf of Bengal, are an example of a land

even more inauspicious than Australia itself. With the exception of external form

sable to human progress seems here wanting. It produces no plants fit for human

animals at all. The aborigines are a small, feeble race of black negroes, in phy-

sical form much below even the impromising Australians. In the same Southern

Hemisphere with Austi-alia lies a land of less extent, but of far higher attributes

than Australia, New Zealand. The two islands which mainly compose it lie within

the similar latitiules with Italy, Greece, and the Archipelago. The soil is fertile,

and high mountains secm-e a perennial supply of water. With these natural advan-

tages, however, they possessed when discovered no native plant amenable to culti-

--vation, or animal capable of domestication ; for the yam, the batata, and the taro

were imported exotics ; and the dog for want of suitable food, small and few

also an imported stranger. The inhabitants themselves were emigrants fi-om the

racter which can hardly have arisen from any other cause than that of a compara-

tively rigorous climate, necessitating exertion.

   The vast continent of America, temperate, tropical, and equatorial, natiu'ally

--f)ossesses many of the essential properties requisite for the promotion of a high civi-

 ization deeply indented coasts, high mountain-chains, and the greatest rivers of

the world, with lakes equivalent to inland seas. It was for the most part covered

with deep forests, imconquerable by the feeble efibrts of savages, clear mountain
plateaux and prairies being the exceptions. Instead of the many cereals of the

Old World, it had but a single com. It had no domestic beast of draught, and

virtually but a single beast of burden, of about one-sixth part of the power of the

camel, and even this one confined to a mountain region, for which alone it was fit.

--But the greatest defect of America consisted in the race of man below the negi-o

of Africa in physical sti-ength, and below the Malay in intelligence. The same

race, with inconsiderable varieties, pervaded the whole continent from Terra del'

Fuego to the confines of the Esquimaux. The highest civilization reached bj' the
American race was that which existed on the high plateau of the Andes but even

--that was far below the degree which had been attained by second- and third-rate

nations of Asia the sufficient proof of which is, that the Mexicans and Peruvians

had not invented letters, nor discovered the art of making iron malleable, as had

all of these. In that portion of America extending fi'om the great chain of lakes

to the Gulf of Mexico, where about two centuries and a half ago savage hunters

alone wandered, there now exists, planted within that comparatively brief period>

--an Anglo-Saxon popidatiou as numerous as that of the country which colonized it,-

and of the same rank of ci\ilization, a fact which attests beyond all question the

natiu-al capacity of this region for developing the highest powers of man. Tliis"

great and prosperous people imitates the coimti-y from whence it sprang in all things,

virtues, vices, and follies. In obedience to tliis example it is at the present moment-

shedding its blood and wasting its wealth to no rational pm-pose.

   The huge mass of land which we call Africa, extending over seventy degi'ees of

latitude, although almost an islfind, has a coast less indented than any other of the

great quartei-s of the globe. It has no high chain of mountains comparable to those
of Eiu'ope, Asia, and America, and hence no gi-eat navigable rivers like theirs. It'

wants also their inland seas and great lakes. Much of its area consists of -wild
sandy deserts, and much of primeval and perennial tropical forest, more difficult.

of transit than the sandy desert itself. These natural obstacles are hindrances to

intercommimication, and therefore to social progress. The races of man which

inhabit Africa correspond with the disadvantages of its phj^sical geography. Taking

the capacity to invent -written letters, to construct durable architectural monuments,

and to form powerful states as tests of capacity for civilization, Afi-ica may be briefly
sketched. To the north of the chain of the Atlas and bordered by the Mediten-a-
uean, we have a naiTOw slip of land in climate and production far more European
than African. The aboriginal people of this region, the Numidians and Maiu'ita-'

nians, the ancestors of the present Kabyles and Berbers, were in phj'sical form and-
niental endo-wment more European, or perhaps Asiatic, than African. The couu-:

tiymen of Jugurtha had invented letters, built dui-able monimients, and acquired

such military skill and power as to enable them to defeat Roman armies. Theiiv

ten-itorial limits, however, were too narrow, and their political skill too small,
to enable them to construct an empire, and for 2000 yeai's they have been subju-

gated by a succession of invaders. Egypt, like Barbary, has the advantage of a
temperate climate, and of the peculiar and perennial fertility confeiTed by the Nile,
T\-ithout which its narrow valley would, like the countrj^ on both sides of it, be a
mere desert of sand. The race which inhabited it was less European or African
than Asiatic, and in capacity bore a considerable resemblance to Chinese. In so
favoured a locality, and -wdth such a people, an early social advancement was

inevitable                                                 but the Egyptian civilization was not a vigorous or an enterprising one.

The EgAT)tians were a home-keeping people, who never left their o-wn country, and-

who, unable to defend it, have been subdued by a succession of invaders for now thirty-

ages. Had the Jews, a people far more highly endowed, been sufficiently nimie-

rous and powerful, which their poor and limited territory forbade, I am of opinion

that instead of the bondsmen they would have been the masters of the Eg^-jitians^

    REPORT 1861.

  From the southern limits of the Sahara to the extremity of the continent, Abys-
sinia excepted, but the great island of Madagascar included, no race of man exists

that has invented letters, built durable architectural monuments, or founded power-
ful commonwealths. Of the races inhabiting this territory, extending over twenty
degrees of latitude, by far the most numerous and to us the most interesting is the
Negro, too well known to need any description. Possessed of gi-eat bodily strength
and power of supporting toil, the history of the Xegi'oes would seem to show that

their understandings are not quite in proportion to their physical qualities. No

systematic and consistent fonu of religious belief has ever originated with a Negro
people, and the object of their belief is merely a mischievous magic. This in-

teriority of the NegTO can only be satisfactorily attributed to lack of mental power.
It is this inferiority, combined with eminent capacity for mechanic labour, that has
induced the powerful among themselves to make a trade in the weaker, just as other
races do in cattle, and which has seduced foreign nations in aU ages to engage in
the hateful traffic, to abstain from which demands an amount of moral restraint
not yet attained by aU the nations of Europe, and reached by none of those of Asia.

10,000,000 of these negi-oes are now in the New World and its islands, 7,000,000
of whom are slaves, to the gi'eat detriment of civilization, whether as regards the

slave or his owner.

   The great Malayan and Philippine Archipelagos afford many striking illusti-a-

tions of the connexion between physical geogi-aphy and ethnology, and I shall
adduce a few examples. The Island of Java, of volcanic formation, has a range of
high moimtains extending from one end to the other. These supply rich plains
and valleys with an abundant perennial irrigation, making this island one of the
most fertile spots on the globe. In form, Java is a long narrow island ; and although
 of half the size of Britain, no part of it is above fifty miles distant fi-om the sea.
Its peaceful and docile inhabitants, at present about 12,000,000 in nimiber, have

immemorially been in possession of letters of their own invention, and their country

contains beautiful architectm-al monuments, while the political institutions of the
Javanese prove by their results that they gave no inconsiderable amount of pro-
tection to life and property. After refening to the contrast shown by Borneo,
another of the islands of the Archipelago, owing to its physical inferiority, he con-

tinued :

    The Malay peninsula, fiilly double the size of Java, with some advantage over it
 in shape, is generally of the same geological formation with Borneo ; and as to
 minerals, it is rich in tin, iron, and gold. Like Borneo, it is covered by a dense

 tropical forest, always, as already stated, a serious and almost msuperable obstacle
to the early progi'ess of civilization. The native inhabitants are ot the same race

 as the Borneans, but even lower in the order of civilization. Immediately east of
 Java are two small islands, Bali and Lombok, of the same geographical foi-mation
 with that island, and, like it, having high ranges of mountains, the som-ce of an
 abimdant imgation. Of the same race with the Javanese and Borneans, they have
 letters and monuments, and are virtually in the same state of advancement as the

 Javanese. Their population, computed at 1,000,000, is probably equal to that of all
 Borneo. The Malayan peninsula and some of the Philippine Islands exhibit a

--phenomenon imknown in any other part of the world that of two distinct races of

 men, dwelling, but not intermixing, in one and the same land. These are the
 Malayan and a diminutive Negro, the latter leading an erratic life in the moimtains,

--in as wild a state as that of any tribe of Americans, and the first with more or less

 civilization even possessing a knowledge of letters. The islands of the Pacific,

 fi'omNew Guinea to the Feejee group, are peopled by negroes, always in a lower
 condition than the brown race which peoplej the neighbom-ing islands, and the

 greater number of their inhabitants are certainly cannibals. Voyagers have noticed
 one favom'able distinction between these negToes and the brown and more civilized

--race they were always foimd honest, while the fairer people were invariably

 incorrigible thieves. The brown race in question, proved, by identity of physical

 form and language, to be the same from the Sandwich to the New Zealand Islands,

 were found on their discovery (the last-named islands excepted) in a higher state

 of civilization than any native people of America, except those inhabiting the
 plateau of the Andes; This advancement they owed to the possession of such

 cultivated plants as the yam, the batata, the bread-fruit, the taro or caladiiun, the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                          181

docoa-nut, and the sugar-cane, witli sucli domestic animals as the dog, the hog, and

common fowl. But, like the rudest Americans, they had no domestic animals for

labom-, and were ignorant of iron and every other metal. Notwithstanding, there-

fore, a fertile soil and mild climate, cut ofi^ as they were, from all intercom-se with

more civilized strangers, they could not be expected to have gone beyond the point

of civilization which they were found to have attained when Europeans first saw

them. Such of them as had no domestic animals, or not an adequate supply of them,

--were imdoubtedly cannibals. The people of the Sandwich Islands now Christians

--certainly were so but eighty years ago.

Advancing to higher civilizations, I may begin with the Persian. Persia is a

plateau generally rising about 3000 feet above the level of the sea. The gi-eater part

of it is within the temperate region, but a considerable portion subtropical. It

has many deserts and salt lakes. In these deserts the fertile spots, that is, those

that are supplied with water, are few in comparison. To this general character,

however, the lands bordering on the Caspian, copiously iriigated from a range of

high mountains, are au exception, for they are eminently fertile. The Persian race

is a peculiar one, and among Asiatics a highly endowed one, personally and intel-

lectually. For five-and-twenty centmies, and probably even a longer time, it has

been in possession of letters and the skill to erect durable monmuents. But the

physical geography of the country is certainly a serious impediment to a stable and

lasting civilization, for it not only encourages the invasion, but the permanent set-

tlement within its borders of pastoral tribes, still retaining their nomadic habits.

These wandering tribes, difi'ering in language and manners from the Persians, are

estimated to amount to a foiu-th part of the population. This is as if one-fourth

Mypart of the popidation of England were to consist of armed gipsies.  next

example is the coimtiy of the Hindus, aland which nourishes twohundred millions of

men, but which, like much of Africa and of Australia; would assuredlj- have been but

an arid desert, with pastoral tribes wandering over it, had it not been for the Hi-

malayas and the Ghauts, the sources of those gi-eat ri\ ers which have given it soil,

inigation, and means of intercommuuication. Hindustan is almost as imbroken a

mass of land as Africa itself, and more so than Australia ; and the amount of this

disadvantage may be estimated by the fact that its coast-line is less than that of
Britain, of one-fifteenth part its extent. Throughout Hindustan the race of man

is probably, in all essentials, the same, with such varieties only as prevail among

Europeans, Negroes, and the red man of America. The Hindus are a black people,

of a deeper tint than any other race of man, the African and Oriental Negro and

--Australian excepted. The form of the head and features is European even of the

highest type, the Grecian ; but experience teaches us that there must be an essen-

tial difierence in the quality of the two brains, although too subtle for anatomy to

detect. There is, in fact, no rational foundation for the extravagant theory which

would make Hindus and Europeans to be of one and the same race, under the absm'd

and hypothetical designation of Caucasian : twenty centuries of history belie the

assertion. Above two thousand years ago the Hindus were, according to the mea-

sure of Asiatic civilization, a highly advanced people, and possessing the evidences

of it in indigenous written language, architectural monuments, and institutions of

some skill and great persistency.

  We come next to the highest civilization of Asia, that of China, the joint result

of superiority of race and favoiu'able physical geography. The high mountain-

chains of China, often rising to the snow-level, and chiefly lying to the west, are the

sources of the great rivers which fertilize spacious alluvial plains, and nourish mil-

lions of men. It was no doubt in these plains that first sprang up the peculiar

civilization which has spread over a region twenty times the extent of Britain, and

numbering fully sixteen times its popiilation. With respect to the quality of the

race itself, it far exceeds all other Asiatic ones in bodily strength, in capacity for

labom", in ingenuity, and in power of supporting vicissitudes of climate, for we find

it thiiving alike under the heat of the equator and the cold of the fiftieth degree of

latitude. It is almost superfluous to add that their knowledge of letters, peculiarly

their own, is of immemorial antiquity. For ages, too, they have had the capacity

to erect gi-eat and enduring stnictiures. Their foolish wall, to keep out the shepherds

of Tai-tary, and compared to which, in magnitude at least, the Pyramids of Egypt

are but mole-hUls, was constructed two huncked years before the birth of Christ.
                                                                 --;:

--182 REPORT 1861.

--The superiority of their political institutions is proved by its fruits a progi-ess in

the useful arts and an accumulation of wealth which have never existed in any
other Asiatic nation. In China, as in India and as in the region which lies between
both, we find rude, unlettered tribes, who, although of the same race as the Chinese,

--have not participated in their civilization. These mountaineers for such they ne-

--cessarily are chiefly aboimd in the less favoured provinces of the west, where the

gi-eat rivers have not yet attained the magnitude which confers fertility and means
of internal commiroication. From the Sea of Japan to the Caspian there exists a
vast region, for the most part steppes and sands. This is the native coimtry of the

--Tartai-s and Turcomans of men who, for the most part, dwell in tents, and whose

normal condition is as migratory as that of birds of passage. Immemorially in
possession of the horse, the camel, and the sheep, the very physical character of
their country would seem to condemn them in pei"petuity to the pastoral condition.

The huge peninsula of Aa-abia, although a tropical or subtropical coimtry, much

resembles Tartary, in the frequency of its deserts and the fewness of its fertile or
watered spots. The habits of its inhabitants, therefore, were generally pastoral,
like those of the Turks and Tartai-s. The highest civilization which the Turks ever
attained was in Eastern Europe and in Northern India ; the highest which the Tar-
tar's reached was in China, and of the Ai'abs in Spain.

   Europe is the quarter of the globe which, through the great advantages of supe-
rior physical geogi'aphy and superior quality of race, has attained the highest mea-
sui-e of civilization. Its extensive seaboard, caused by deep gulfs and inland seas

its niunerous lakes and rivers ; its many islands, with a temperate climate, afford it
means of industry, commerce, and intercommunication possessed by no other part
of the world. The superiority of its races of man is attested by an experience of
three thousand years. In the quality of these races among themselves there is, pro-
bably, no material difference ; sufficiently proved by the fact that no deterioration

follows their intei-mixtm-e, as shown in the instances of the very bastard people whom

we call French and English. The tenn Em-ope, however, is but a conventional

and not a ve*y well-defined one, and the advantages of physical geography and race
which I have ascribed to it belong especially to the southern portion, always its only
seats of high civilization. The sterile and oft ice-bound far North has never pro-
duced,and seems incapable of producing-, a great and powerful civilization. Yet from

the rigorous North has emanated one of the most highly-endowed races of man
that which overthrew the huge structure of the Roman Empire, which in later times

conquered a large portion of France and the whole of Britain, and to which, above

all other causes, is o-wing the vigorous civilization of modem Europe and Northei-n

America. The vast superiority of the European over the other races of man, and

especially over the precocious but soon stagnant races of Asia, need not be insisted

on at length, and I shall confine myself to a few modem instances. Thus, but for

the Eui'opean race, the old and new world would have been unkno-wn to each other
that race has conquered the whole new world and largely peopled it -with men more
civilized, more powerful, and far more numerous than its aboriginal inhabitants.
But for the European race, China would have been kno-svn to the rest of the world
only by report, and Japan and the great Indian Archipelago as unknown as Ame-
rica. While the Em-opean nations have virtually subdued all America, discovered

and conquered a fifth quarter of the globe, Australia, and conquered and occupied
a considerable part of Asia, no foreign race can be said to have invaded and perma-

mnently settled Europe. The Tm-ks conquered the weakest and most degenerate

portion of Em-ope, and beyond this they have never succeeded in penetrating, not-

Tvithstanding many attempts. They have been in Eastei-n Europe about half the

time that the Saracens had been in Spain, but, in the true character of an Oriental
race, they either refuse or are imable to keep pace with the European races, and,

now existing only by their sufferance, absorption or expulsion is their inevitable

fate.

   Tlie races of Asia (and it .affords incontestable evidence of incapacity and inapti-
tude) have borrowed little from Europe. I can quote but two notable exceptions
tire-amis and tobacco, both of which they promptly adopted on the first opportunity.
They reject the printing-press, obstinately perseveiing in the slow and expensive
manuscript which in Europe mipeded the progress of knowledge 500 yeai-s ago.
They, very rarely use the mai-iner s compass, but steer along the shore, orti-ust'^to'

the stars and the monsoons. The Eiu'opean races have, on the contrary, borrowed
freely from every coimtry that had anything good to give. From Asia the list of
our adoptions is large, for from it we have derived cotton and the cotton manuftic-
tiire, silk and the silk manufacture, paper, without which the printing-press would
be worthless, the sugar-cane and its extracts, tea, coffee, spices, and opium. Nor
must the domestic fowl be omitted, for that valuable acquisition is of Asiatic
origin. To America we owe the potato, maize, the cinchona, the tobacco, and the
turkey, and to Asia and America jointly all our most valuable dyes. To Africa our
obligations are smaller ; but palm oil, the gallinae, and the ass may be named with
respect. As to the invention of written language and to monuments of a high order,
the only parts of Europe which boast of having possessed them are Greece and Italy,
which in the march of ci'sdlization had so long preceded all the rest. The nations
of Em'ope, now the foremost in letters, were (the Runic characters excepted, which
probably never extended beyond the priesthood) as ignorant of them 2000 years ago
as were the Mexicans when first seen by Em-opeans. In this respect, as indeed in

architecture, they have been but dextrous imitators. This is a striking contrast to-

the precocious races of Asia, many rude tribes of whom, less civdized than ancient
Gauls, Germans, and Britons, have been in possession of alphabets of their own in-

vention from time immemorial.

   The most favomed parts of Em'ope, even those which are now the seats of the

highest civilization, afford, like India and China, examples of civilization retarded
through disadvantage of physical geography, without any proved inferiority of race.

Oiu- own island yields two signal instances, Wales and the Highlands of Scotland.
Had the whole area of Britain been no better than they, it is quite certain that we

--could not have been what we are powei-fril, opulent, populous, and great. Their

inhabitants, compared with those of the fi'uitful parts of the island, were as the
Gonds and GaiTows of India to the Hindus, or the Mj'o-tse of China to the Chinese.

From their coiurage and locality they were difficult to subdue, and their unavoidable

poverty ofiered no temptation. It is only by slow degrees, and the influence and
example of a more advanced nation, that a people so circumstanced is brought within
the pale of civilization. The process is, at present, in rapid advancement in the
mountains of Wales and Scotland, even to the extinction of their barbarous although

masculine and forcible tongues ; but it has taken eighteen centuries to bring the

Welsh and Highlanders to their present state from that which they were in when
Gibbon describes one of them (and the other was probably little better) as consist-
ing of "ti'oops of naked barbarians," who "chased the deer of the forest over cold
and lonely heaths, amid gloomy hills and lakes covered with a blue mist."

Journey in the Interior ofJapan, with the Ascent of Fusiyama. By E. Alcock.

The paper commenced with a description of the difficulties which the wiiter

Aencountered in Yeddo, in the early part of his journey in Japan.  large retinue

accompanied him. The journey was begim in September 1860. On their way

they had to cross the river Said on the shoulders of porters, who were made re-

sponsible for the safety of the passengers ; if any accident occm'red to the travellers,

the men had nothing to do but to drown themselves, as no excuse was taken. At

fii-st their way up the mountain lay through wa\ang fields of corn, succeeded by a

belt of high rank grass. Soon, however, they entered the margin of the wood

which surroimded the base, and which crept high up the side of the moimtain.

--At first they foimd trees of large growth goodly timber of the oak, the pine, and

the beech. At Hachimondo they left their horses and the last trace of permanent

habitations and the haunts of men. Soon after the wood became thinner and more

stunted in growth, while the cork and birch took the place of the oak and the pine.

--Just before they entered the forest-ground a lark rose on the wing the first the

author had ever seen or heard in Japan. As a general rule, the birds had no song,

the flowers no fragrance, and fruit and vegetables no savour or delicacy. In the

wood-belt were deer, wild boars, and horses. They soon aftei-wards lost all traces
of life, vegetable or animal. On their journey the}' rested a little in huts or caves,

partly dug out of the side and roofed. There were eleven of these resting-places,

which were one or two miles apart, between Hachimondo and the summit of the

moimtain. The latter half of tne jom'ney was the most arduous. On the top ol

--the mountain was a yawning crater a great oval opening with jagged lips, estimated

at about 1100 yards in length, with a mean width of 600, and about 350 in depth.
Looking from the mountain, the country below was hid by a canopy of cloud. The
estimated height of the edge of the crater above the level of the sea was 13,977 feet,
and the highest peak 14,177 feet. The Japanese who performed the pilgrimage
were generally dressed in white vestments, which on the summit were stamped
with various seals and images by the priests located there during the season. As
far as the T\Titer coidd learn, a verj' holy man, the founder of the Sintoo religion,
took up his residence on the mountain, and his spirit was still held to have influence
to bestow health and other blessings on those who made the pilgrimage. The
volcano had long been extinct. The latest eruption recorded was in 1707 ; and
the tradition was that the moimtain itself rose in a single night from the bowels of
the earth, a lake of equal dimensions appearing the same hour at Miaco. The time
occu^pied by the ascent of the mountain was eight hours, and the descent was ac-
complished in little more than three hours. The party slept two nights on the
mountain, and had greatly to congratulate themselves on the weather.

On Australia, mcluding ilie Recent Explorations of Mr. Macdonald Stuart.
                         By the Hon. J. Baker, F.B.G.S.

   Mr. Baker gave a rapid sketch of the rise of the colonies of Australia and the

habits of the aboriginal inhabitants. Dming the last year or two, the amount of

gold discovered had rather diminished than increased ; and a considerable number

of hands were now employed in cidtivating the soil who were previously engaged

AUin the diggings.  other exports were gradually increasing, and only population

was required to enlarge them to an almost imlimited extent. There were numerous
rich mineral deposits, and many places in which cotton might be grown with ad-

vantage. There was not a more loyal people imder the sun than the Australian

colonists. Mr. Baker then gave a few extracts from Mr. Stuart's journal of his last

expedition into the interior. After noticing the starting of the expedition, on the

2nd March, 1860, and the successive visits to Mount Hamilton, and Beresford,

"Williams, Milne's, Keck%vick, and other springs, the character of the countiy at the

West Neale, Frero, the Stevenson, Mount Humphries, the High Gum Creek, &c.,

the arrival of the traveller at a small gum-creek under Mount Stuart on the 22nd

--of April was refen-ed to that being found, from observation of the sun, to be the
Acentre of Australia.
                       tree was there marked, and the British flag planted. It was

a mistake to suppose that the flowers in that country had no smell, a rose being

found vrith a sweet, strong perfume. Subsequent interesting adventures were
sketched, and the third unsuccessfid attempt of the traveller to make the Victoria

Kiver was alluded to, the journal concluding with the arrival of the party at Cham-

bers Creek.

    Origin of the Designation ' Mountains of the Moon,' as applied to them*.

   By CnAELES T. Beke, Ph.D., F.8.A., F.R.G.S. ^x.

   This paper was in continuation of the author's commimications to the British
Association in the years 184('), 1848 and 18olt.

   It commenced ty stating that the gi'eat additions made to our geogTaphical
knowledge since the date of the author's previous couununications have all tended

   In 1846 Dr. Beke described the Abessinian table-land as having its summit-line
towards the sea-coast, and thence falling gTodually towards the Nile ; which river
skirts the western flank of the high land, and is the sink into which all the rivers
flowing over the table-land are received. The fall of the Nile is so small, that Dr.
Beke then estimated its absolute elevation, in the fifth parallel of north latitude,

at not more tlian 2000 feet. It is now found that at Gondokoro, in 4° 44' N. lat.,
the elevation of the bed of the Nile is only 1911 feet. On the other hand, the

mountain-range of Eastern Africa, forming the anticlinal axis between the ocean

and the basin of the Nile, which in 1846 could only be traced as far as 9° 30' N.

lat., may now be regarded as extending beyond the sixth parallel of south latitude,

in a line running from N.N.E. to S.S.W. between the 40th and 35th meridians.

It was next stated that the snowy moimtains, Kilimandjaro, Kenia, and Doengo-

Engai, which in 1846 were unkno'mi, are portions of this mountain-i-ange of East-

em Africa, to which Dr. Beke attributes the name of the "Mountains of the Moon,"

--the snows of which are described by Ptolemy as flo-n-ing into the two lakes of the

Nile the lakes intended being Tanganjoka and Nyanza, recently discovered by

Captains Biu^on and Speke.

With reference to the derivation of the designation " Mountains of the Moon "

from the name of the countrj^, U-Nyamwezi, in the vicinity of those lakes, the

--author showed in the first place how the Indian name of the island of Java Java-

dvipa was ti-anslated into Greek KpiBris vija-os or Barlvy Island, just as the Latin

name of the Etruscan citj^ and port of Lima was translated '2iKr)vr)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             though there

is reason for belieraig that such significations did not belong to the words Java

and Luna in their respective aboriginal languages, but were merely mistransla-

tions, or rather misapprehensions, by the Indian conquerors of Java in the one

case, and by the Romans in the other. In the same way, the native African name
U-Nyamwezi, having become known to the Greeks through the Sawahilis, or people
of the coast, in whose language mivezi means moon, may have been supposed to
have some connexion with the name of that planet.

   Dr. Beke argued, however, that Mwezi, as a component part of the name U-Nya-
mwezi, does not necessarily mean moo7i in the aboriginal language of the countiy.

All the Kafir tongues have certain prefixes, distinguishing singulars from plurals,

adjectives from substantives, and one kind of substantive from another. Thus Ki-
Nyamwezi is the language spoken by the Wa-Nyamwczi, which people dwell in the

country called U-Nyamwezi, one of them being a M'Nyamwezi or Mu-Nyamwezi
(whence our " Monomoezi ").

It  appeai-s  then that the root  is  not 3Iwezi, but Nymmcezi                                                                                                     and though it may
                                                                                                                                                                ;

be that the natives themselves never use the root without some prefix, strangers

might not imreasonably do so, and even contract Nyamtcezi into Micezi, as the
Sawahilis and Arabs, according to Captain Burton, actually do ; and fi-om this con-

traction, the translation into the Greek Selene would have' followed as a matter of

coiurse.

   What the theoretical root may mean in the Nyamwezi language has yet to be
ascertained. Meanwhile the rendering of U-Nyamwezi into " Possession of the
Moon," or " Land of the Moon," may Avell be questioned. Should it prove to be
erroneous, the designation "Moimtains of Me Moon," as applied to the great moun-

tain-range of Eastern Africa in which are the sources of the Nile, will have origi-

nated in a mistranslation or misconception. Still, this well-known name has been
in use during so many ages, that it could hardly be practicable, and certainly would

--not be judicious, to supersede it now.
   The paper concluded thus : " The entire eastern side of the basin of the Nile

appears to be amiferous, the gold collected in various parts of it since the earliest

ages being brought down by the tributaries of that river ; so that there is reason
to consider the Moimtains of the Moon as a meridional metalliferous cordiUera,

similar in its general characters to the Ural and the con-esponding moimtain-ranges

of America and Australia          Whenever the discovery shall be made in Eastern

Africa of some of the chief deposits of that precious metal, the influx fi-om all parts

of the civilized world to the ' diggings ' in the Mountains of the Moon will be such

as to occasion a more rapid and complete revolution in the social condition of those

hitherto neglected regions, than could be caused by commerce, by missionary labours,

by colonization, or by conquest ; as we have witnessed in other quarters of the globe,

where the auri sacra fames has collected together masses of the most daring
Weand energetic of human beings.
                                      shall then, too, doubtless see in Eastern

Africa, as in California and in Australia, the formation of another new race of

mankind."

                  Notice of a Volcanic Eruption on the Coast of Abessinia.

                 By Charles T. Beke, Ph.D., F.S.A., F.R.G.S. Sfc.

     During tlie night of the 7th or morning of the 8th of May, 1861, a volcanic erup-

 tion took place from Djebel Dubbeh, in about 13° 57' N. lat., and 4P 20' E. long.,

 accompanied by loud shocks resembling the discharge of artillery and immense
 clouds of dust. The noises were distinctly heard both at Jlassowah and at Perim,
 jjaces nearly 400 mUes apart, and the dust fell for several days over a vast extent
 of the Red Sea, and on the coast of Aa-abia as far as the moimtain-range of Yemen.
 At Edd, on the Abessinian coast, a day's jom-ney from Djebel Dubbeh, the dust
 was knee-deep, and its fall dm-ing the first day caused total darkness. The erup-
 tion continued at intervals for three or four days. There is no remembrance of any
 previous eruption. Djebel Dubbeh is distant about 230 mUes, in a dii-ection almost
 due north, from the gi-eat extinct volcano Aiyalu or Azalo, mentioned in Dr. Beke's

  aper " On the Mountains forming the Eastern Side of the Basin of the Nile ; " and,
Iike Aiyalu and also Kilimandjaro, it forms a portion of the mountain-system to

 which he attributes the designation of the Mountains of the Moon*.

RemarTcs on the Glacial Movements tioticed in the Vicinity of Mount St. Elias,

   on the North-west Coast of America. By Admiral Sir E. Belcher, C.B.,

    P.B.A.8.

   Early in September 1837, Sir Edward's expedition ran down the coast of North

America, between ports Etches and Mulgi-ave, in order to fix the position and de-
termine the height of Mount St. Elias.

   The icebergs which hung about the coast were much lai'ger than those which
he had_ seen in Behring's Strait and northerly, or off the mouths of the fiords in
the -^-icinity of Port Etches. The icebergs presented a beautiful appearance.

   He (^Sir Edward) believed that in the upper valley of Icj^ Bay the lower bodies

of the ice were subject to slide, and that the entu-e substratum, as frequently foimd
within the Arctic Cu-cle, was composed of slippery mud. In ley Bay the appa-
rently descending ice, fi'om the mountains to the base, was in irregular broken
masses, which tumbled in confusion. The motion was clearly continuous.

   As to the causes which operated in producing the constant displacements of the
glacier, and the protrusion of the bergs to seaward, many theories had been pro-
posed. His (Sir Edward's) impression was that, whatever was the intensitj- of
cold under which congelation had taken place, the actual temperature due to the
ice was merely that of 32° Fahrenheit, and that self-registering thermometers,
  roperly bmied in ice or snow, subject even to the very low temperature of 62° 5'
Ielow zero on the external skin of snow, only indicated the proper temperatui-e of

freezing water. Salt-water ice has a temperature or 28°.

   In the very high latitudes of 66° to 76° north, the snow on the siuface of the
snow-clad elevations funiished sufficient water to undermine the lower beds of snow-
ice, and bore a passage to the sea. However firm the crust might be in certain
positions, a fiu'ious ton-ent had been at work beneath.

   They were thus di-iven to the couclusion that the temperature of the earth must
in some degi-ee aid in keeping up a temperatiu-e sufficiently high to prevent the
congelation of the water hidden from light or the sun's raj's. The advance of vege-
tation was another proof, the gi-ouud-willow, saxifrages, and mayflower, and many
other plants, producing their shoots before light caused the immediate expansion
and colouring of the leaf.

   The earth's temperature, acting on the lower portions next to the soil, aided in
facilitating the travel of the slip of the snow-ice of which these glaciers were com-
posed to lower levels. In all ice-fomiations might be noticed, at the season which
followed the period of day frost or preceded the spring, a peculiar dryness, the re-

sult of evaporation of the supei-fluous water, attended by dense fogs. An ominous

cracking was then experienced, which had been misrepresented by some of the
first Arctic explorers as the breaking of the bolts of their vessels ; no bolt was ever

traced to have been so broken ! He ima· goi' ned that the soU on which masses of eter-

the 20th and 2l8t June, 24th September,- and 16th October, lfc"61.

 nal or eternally-shifting ice reposed must be, from never being exposed to the sun's

 rays, of a loose, boggy, or muddy nature, which facilitated slipping. The imder-

 mining facilitated cracking ; and the very action of alternate freezing and thawing
 between the exposed surfaces, serving as aqueducts along the upper portions into
 which water woidd flow, must produce compact ice ; and its power in that very
 action was quite adequate, by comparison, not only to remove ice, but even moun-

 tains of earth, provided the point d'appui be aftbrded.

    It was evident with respect to the lower portions supporting Mount St. Elias,
 and which were subject to a summer heat which ripened strawberries, and was
 even more oppressive than we experienced in England, with the rapid thaws of the
 inferior levels, that repeated fractiu'e and avalanches occurred. They must calcu-
' late on sudden tremendous coucussive force, by the breaking away of whole ranges
 and their precipitation on the lower strata. His opinion was that the shocks of
 the avalanches conmiimicated laterally had produced such fractm-es as had been,
 noticed in those peculiar pyramidal forms near Moimt St. Elias. These fractures,
 opened, were filled by water, which probably froze at night or when the sim was
 absent ; and expansion drove the exterior masses, which were termed bergs, into

 the sea.

    Such was his theory, foimded on severe thought over a period of thirty-five yeai's,
 vmder frequent contact with natm-e in actual operation.

   The Great Earthquake at Mendoza, 20th March, 1861. Extracts from a

               Letter written by E.. Bridge to W. Bollaeet, F.G.S.

   This catastrophe, the writer said, was treated by all as an earthquake ; and, in the
simple sense of the word, it might be classified as such, as the writer foimd in Mr.
Bollaert's Avork on Earthquakes ; but he distinguished between an earthquake and
an internal miiption. The latter had evidently been the case at Mendoza, since its
efl'ects had been felt north, south, east, and west of the city, at Valparaiso, Coquimbo,
in Chili, San Juan (north of Mendoza), and El Rosario (east of Mendoza), more
or less equidistant. It was deficient in many of the characteristics of the earth-
quakes experienced in Chili, not having followed a line, no rain having fallen, and
difl'erences of time not having been observable. In fact, it appeared to have been,
simultaneous at all places ; to have been an upheaving exclusively at Mendoza, and

between that and the Andes. No volcano had, however, been foimd. The walls of

the buddings had fallen, indicative of having been rent in every direction, none in-
dicating any horizontal motion ; indeed, had there been any such, the loss of life,
estimated at 10,500 out of 13,000, would not have been so great, as the means of
escape would have been facilitated by different fallings.

Cromleachs and EocJcing -stones considered Etlinolocjically. By P. O'Caila-

   GHAN, B.A., Honorary Secretary to the PhilosoiMcal and Literary Society

    of Leeds.

   The author observed that no stone object of human veneration or superstition
was so universally distributed over the face of the globe as the Cromleach. He

then gave the Celtic derivation of the word, implying " crooked " or " inclining

stone. ' He stated that, in consequence of its cimibrous obsti-uction, it has been for

the most part removed or broken up in the cultivated parts of Europe, and was con-

sequently now seldom seen but in desolate and secluded places, except where it had
some peculiar local protection. From this circvmistance, and especially from its

rude and massive proportions, its construction was vidgarly ascribed to supernatural

agency. After noticing the researches of Mr. Lukis and Sir R. Colt Hore, he said

that it was now conceded on all hands that the Cromleach was originally a tomb or

--grave. He then described the manner in which he saw the Caribs dispose of their

dead doubling up the body into the smallest possible compass, and depositing it in
a narrow excavation imder one or more large stones, to conceal and protect it from

the carnivorous animals of the surroimding forests. He thought that this was in all

Erobability the most primitive, as it was the most natural, way of disposing of the
 uman dead body, in man's savage state, all over the world. He inferred fi-om this

ttatthe original Cromleach was of natural or aceidental formation, and showed
--188 REPORT 1861.

di-awings of several -whicli he said must have been thus formed. Two especially,

of vast size, he thought were boulders di'opped from ice-floes, which in falling upon

others broke them, and remained ever since secm-ely supported upon these rude

props. They would then become ready-made and secm'e tombs, and would be con-

tinually used for such a pm-pose from the remotest ages.

On this supposition he thought that the relics of various and successive races,

which are occasionally foimd in such Crondeachs, could be easily accoimted for.

He observed that it was not sui-prising that these large blocks of stone, so mysteri-

ously disposed, should have produced a feeling of awe and veneration, and that they

shoiUd even come to be regarded as objects of superstitious fear or idtimately of

religious worship, such as that practised by the Druids. He said that he did not

mean to assert that all Cromleachs were so     formed                               on  the  contraiy, he  thought
                                                                                 ;

that the gi-eater mmiber, especially of the smaller ones, were evidently ai-tificial.

All he meant to contend for was, that the original Cronileach was of natm-al or

accidental fonnation, and used as a grave for coimtless ages before its artificial imi-

tation, which idtimately assumed the fonn of a rude tomb. He considered that the

universal distribution of the Cronileach shoidd not be looked upon as a conclusive

proof of an identity of origin of the various races of man, but rather as an indica-

tion of an identity of the instinctive resources of the human intellect under similar
circumstances. He instanced the curious similarity-, almost amoimtiug to identity,

of two stone hatchets in the Museum at Leeds, one of which was brought from

Otaheite, and the other found, with ancient British relics, in a cave near Settle.

He thought that when the materials of a Cromleach were light and easily dis-

placed, the instinctive resom-ce imder such circumstances would be to conceal it

under a mound of earth or stones, as the locality could aflbrd. This he believed

to be the ti-ue histoi-y of the original timiulus or caini, which were the probable

prototypes of those stupendous p;sTamidal structures of the more civilized

Egj'ptians. He considered this a more natural explanation of those universal

structures than the dreamy visions of certain ethnologists, who will only see in

them the Aestiges or landmarks of improbable himian migi'ations, of which they

offer us no more satisfactoiy evidence than the ingenious specidations of philolo-

gists, who find in language such a plastic material that they can moidd it into any

form to suit their own preconceived theories.

Amongst the other megalithic wonders, the erection of which has been popularly

ascribed to supernatural agency, he remarked that none was more striking than the

/* Rocking-stone." He quoted a passage from Wilson's 'Prehistoric Annals of

Scotland, in which the writer gi-aphically describes the engineering science and

mechanical skill evinced in their erection. He thought that the theoiy advanced

by him for the formation of the primitive Cromleach woidd easily remote all these

mechanical difiicidties. He obseiTed that if the glacial flood, of which we have

everywhere such manifest indications, had borne away upon its enormous ice-rafts

vast blocks of stone, torn from the abraded sides of the valleys as they di-ifted

thi-ough them, these masses of rock must have been all deposited on the bottom of

this icy sea, on its increase of temperatm-e and subsidence. Now, many of these

floating boulders must, he thought, have fallen upon others, and rested upon the

broken fragments, as in the instance of the Cromleach. He considered that it was

not imreasonable to suppose that occasionallj' others may have been deposited

quietly upon the veiy pivot of theu* centi'es of gravity, where they woidd remain

curiously balanced, on the retreat of the waters. They woidd there natiu-ally be-

come objects of wonder and awe to the savage human creatures who first beheld
them, and to all succeeding generations. He stated that the Phoenicians and Greeks

assigned to the Eocking-stone divine power, and that the priests everywhere

availed themselves of this superstitious fear. The author exhibited a sketch of the

famous Logan Stone of Cornwall, to show how impossible it was to look upon it as
the work of human hands. He described another sort of Rocking-stone, which he

thought to have been formed by the gradual wearing of the narrow base of the

overlj-ing stone. Li Ulustration of this latter idea, he exhibited a sketch of an

" erratic block " near Settle, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, ·which is figured in
Professor PhiUips's interesting work on that county. He thought that it was not

difficult to foresee that, in the lapse of time not very remote, the small base upon

which this rock now rests secm^ely may be scaled off by rain and frost, until

the huge mass becomes detached, or poised upon a pivot so small as to allow it to

oscillate as a Rocking-stone.

      Notices on ilie Efhnologi/, Geography, and Commerce of the Caucasus.

                                  By CAPTAiif Cameron.

   The locality referred to was the Caucasian Isthmus. Hercules, Castor and
Pollux, Ulysses, and other Greek worthies were all said to have done something
towards opening the Caucasus to the enterprise of their coimtrymen. It grew to
be pre-eminently a land of marvels. After reference to the ancient traditions of
the Amazons, it was stated that the Caucasus had played its part in history, and
especially made itself felt in the movements of the two important continents which
it both separated and linked together. The Caucasus was a laboratory in which
nature had been working on the largest scale, and magnificent results were given
in its varied geological formation, &c. The beginning of the establishment of the
Cossacks in the Caucasus dated some centuries back, and their numbers were
systematically augmented by Peter the Great and his successors. After a reference
to the various Tartar tribes, and to the Tcherkissis, whose habits were graphically
described, other portions of the inhabitants of the Caucasus were similarly noticed.
So far from Shamil being the chief of the Circassians, they looked upon his " level-
ling " system of goveioiment with suspicion and dislike ; and it was only among
the Tchetchess and Lesghins that Shamil had any power. The Caucasus possessed
every diversity of soil ; it was capable of producing indigo and cotton. The silk
trade had received a stimulus by the failure of the supply in other quarters. Dm-ing
the Irish famine, 125,000 bushels of Indian corn were exported to this coimby. In
the Caucasus, as elsewhere in the East, Swiss manufactures were gaining rapidly
on those of England, a fact which Mr. Henies ascribed to the circumstance that
hand-loom patterns and colours could be constantly |varied without difficulty or
expense, which, he said, was not the case with power-loom weaving. In the bazaars
in Mingrelia, however, the average of British goods as against Swiss was generally
as three to two. Steam had been introduced both on the Black and Caspian Seas
and elsewhere.

     On the Geography and Natural History of Western Equatorial Africa.
                                 By P. B. Du Challlxt.

   This singular region, explored by the author dming the years 1856-7-8-9, lay
within two degrees on either side of the equator, and extended for 400 miles into
the interior. Having described its physical featiues, its partly swampy, partly
mountainous character, and its dense forests, which ascend to the very tops of the
mountains ; its rivers, the Muni, the Moondah, and the Gaboon, all rising in the
range of mountains known as SieiTa del Crj-stal, 60 or 80 miles ii-om the west ; also
the Nazareth, the Mexias, and the Eemand-vaz, the latter chiefly fed by the Ogobai,
and this last fed by the Rembo Ngouyai and the Eembo Okanda ; the traveller, re-

verting to the mountains, said, " Judging from my own examination, and from the

most carefid inquiries among the people of the far interior, I think there is good

reason to believe that an important mountain-range divides the continent of Afi-ica
nearly along the line of the equator, starting from the west from the range which

nms along the coast north and south, and ending in the east, probably in the coun-

try south of the mountains of Abyssinia, or perhaps temiinating- abruptly to the

north of the lake Tanganyika of Captains Burton and Speke." To the existence of
this range, and of the flat, wooded, damp coimtry at its foot, he attributed the fact
that Manometanism had never in Afr-ica spread south of the equator. The natural
history of the country was next referred to at some length. With regard to the gorilla,
he considered it probable that its range was coextensive with the dense jimgle of

the interior. He had no doubt that with the advance of civilization in that region

this monster would disappear ; and it was a great satisfaction to the scientific world
and to himself to know that, whatever might happen, the world woidd have, from
the pen of one of its most illustrious zootomists, Professor Owen, an imperishable
record of the most wonderful anthropoid animal yet desciibed.

He doubted whether there is another district of the same size as that which he
exploited in Western Equatorial Africa, holding so many vaiieties of tribes,

all thinking theniselTes separate nations and possessing different names, though

many speak the same language or dialect. One of the great peculiarities of most,

of these tribes is that their villages are intermingled with each other. There are
no landmai'ks assigned to each tiibe ; every village squats and settles where the

people choose, and every now and then the traveller will be astonished to see a

village belonging to a certain tribe far removed fi-oni it. This habit of selecting
land wherever the people of a village like is owing to the vast extent of unoccupied

--territory. He found that the cannibals are the tallest and handsomest of these

tribes ; many were of athletic forms ^in fact, magnificent savages ; but he had
foimd Fans near the equator, at the head-waters of the Gaboon River, who had not
the fine appearance of these mountaineers. They even eat the dead. With the

exception of these cannibals, the other tribes seem to be intermediate in stature,
between the tall and slim. Yolof and other tiibes of North Africa, and the small-

sized men of the Congo and of the more southern tribes of that continent, accord-

ing to the specimens he had seen, are small and ugly, but the Kafiirs are tall and

handsome negroes. These equatorial people are well-proportioned, not stout, but
built as if capable of endming great fatigue. They may, as a whole, be called

middle-sized men. Among the cannibals the females appeared in many instances

smaller in proportion to the males. According to the commonly received norion,
the negroes dwelling under the line, or near to it, ought to be darker than those
removed fi'om the line. This is a mistake. The coimtries he had visited do not
possess what we should call black uegi-oes, with the exception of the Ashira tribe,

who are in conti*ast with the tribes surrounding them. He had come to the con-
clusion, from his observations, that the negi'oes who inhabit a damp and moist

countiy, and especially mountainous countries, are less black, though they possess
all the negro features, than those belonging to an open countn,-, where a dry
atmosphere is prevalent. In fact, the equatonal negroes are far from being as dark

as the negi'oes he had seen living near the gi'eat desert in the Senegal coimtry.

Among the cannibals, but more especially among the Apingi, he had foimd pei-sons
looking almost like mtilattoes. Albinos are rather common in the tribes he had

visited. In this pai-t of equatorial Africa the negi'oes inhabiring the sea-shore are

a shade darker than those of the interior. The negroes of this part of equatorial
Africa do not belong to the lowest tA^pe of the Western coast ; they are superior to

those of the Congo or more Southern-African tiibes. The cannibals may be con-
sidered as among the best blacksmiths in .Vfrica. They work iron in a most
beautifrd manner. They make knives, spears, axes, and hammers, many of which
are good and beautifriUy shaped. The cannibal tribes are the only ones he had
seen using the poisoned aiTows. The tribes he visited south of the equator possess

a loom, and weave the fibres of a species of palm into cloth of considerable fineness

and tenacity. Among the people of the same tribe intelligence varies considerably.

These negi'oes possess an imagmarive mind, are astute speakers, sharp tradei-s, great

liars, possessing gTeat power of dissimulation, and are far from being in many re-
spects the stupid people they ai-e believed to be. In making bargains they are as

shrewd as any Em'opean. In even-thing that does not require mental labour and
forethought they seemed to leam as fast as any among the intellectual races,

to a certain point. When he had to rely on them for anything that required

 the exercise of memorj' or forethought, anything on which the power of reflection
was required, then they failed partly, perhaps, through laziness. Though often

                                                                                                                                                  ;

 treacherous, they have noble qualities, are given to hospitality : food is never
bought; the rich and the poor have food enough to satisfy their hunger. The

women show great tenderness of heart, especially when one takes into account how
harshly they are treated. Many times he had been mider great obligations to them
when sick for their kind care. They built houses either with the bark of trees or a
species of wild bamboo : the houses are small, and there is no other opening than a
 door ; sometimes, however, they possess two doors. With reference to the law of
 intermarriage, the author read a long extract from his published work on that sub-
                                                          ;

Aject. universal belief existed in good and e^-il spirits, and in the power of chamis^

called Monda, made with a variety of objects. They also believed in the power of

witchcraft and the significance of cbeanis. He had come to the determined con-

viction that, though these people lay offerings upon the gi-aves of their friends,
though they even sometimes shed the blood of slaves on the gi-ave of a chief or

that of a father of a family, though they fear the spirit of the recent dead, they
have no definite idea as to the state of the soid after death. It is true they fear

the spirit or ghost of the recently departed, and place fm-niture, dress, and food on
their graves, and return fi'om time to time with fresh supplies of food. The spirits

of the -victims slain at the graves, whether women or men, it is believed join that
of him who has departed. During the season appointed for mourniug, the deceased
is remembered and feared ; but when once his memory grows dim, fear gradually

lessens, presents of food over the grave become more and more scarce, and the gene-

ration that comes afterwards, and who never saw the man, abstain from giving any

present whatever, and take no concern about such spirit. The burial-gi-ound exists
only among a very few tribes ; but among many, as soon as a person has died, the

corpse is left imder a tree, and the village is removed to a far distance. Ask the
negro where is the spirit of his great grandfather : he says he does not know ; it is
fone. Ask him about the spirit of his father or brother, who died yesterday ; then

  e is fidl of fear and ten-or ; he believes it to be generally near the place where the
body has been bm-ied. There is, as he had mentioned above, a total lack of gene-
ralization. Thus some M-ill believe that a certain man's soul, after he died, went
into the body of a bird, beast, or gorilla ; but ask them concerning the transmigTa-

tion of soids in general, they wiU say they know nothing. They fear the spirit of

the recently departed ; they think of it as a vindictive thing which must be con-
ciliated. All the tribes he had visited had faith in the power of existing spirits,
generally called Obambou, or Oconcou, and the other Mbuiri ; they have other names
in various tribes which come near to these names ; both appear to have power to

mdo good or evil. They are not represented by idol'?, but many villages have

houses built for their occupation when tired of wandering, and food is offered to
them. In some tribes they are believed to be married to two female spirits ; they
ai-e said sometimes to walk in the street of the village and to speak to those they
meet. They believe in idols, and each clan and head of a family possesses one.

These idols are believed to have the power to keep the clan out of evU., and to be

able to foretell events. The people, the author continued, are totally ignorant of God

or a Supreme Beuig. Witchcraft was believed in polygamy was very prevalent
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and slavery an institution of the land. Slaves were the money of the country, the
standard of valuation. Many of these Afi-ican tribes are fast disappearing j their

languages or dialects will disappear with them.

On the Antiquity of Man, from tlie Evidence of Language,
                  By John Ckawftjrd, F.R.S,

The periods usually assigned for man's first appearance on earth necessarily

dates only from the time when he had already attained such an amount of civili-

zation as to enable him to frame some kind of record of his own career, and take

no account of the many ages which must have passed away before he could
have attained that power. Among the many facts which attested the high anti-

--quity of man was the fonnation of language. Language was not innate, but

adventitious a mere acquirement, having its origin in the superiority of the

--human understanding. The prodigious nmuber of languages which existed was

one proof that language was not innate, some with a veiy narrow range of articu-

late sounds, others with a very wide one ; some confined to single syllables, while
others had many ; some being very simple and others of a veiy complex stnictm-e,

thus implying that each tongue was a separate and distinct creation, or that each
Ahorde fomied its own independent tongue.
                                           whole nation might lose its original

tongue, and in its stead adopt any foreign one. The language which was the ver-

nacular one of the Jews 3000 years ago had ceased to be so above 2000 years ago,

--and the descendants of those who spoke it were now speaking an infinity of foreign

tongaies sometimes European and sometimes Asiatic. Languages derived from

a single tongue of Italy had superseded the ninny native languages which were
192 REPORT 1861.

Aonce spoken in Spain, in France, and in Italy itself.                                                                             lan^iage of Gei-nian origin

had nearly displaced not only all tlie native languages of Britain and Ireland, but

the numerous ones of a large portion of America. Some eight millions of negi-oes

were planted in the New World, whose forefathers spoke many African tongues,

which tongues had nearly disappeared, having been supplanted'by idioms derived

from the German and Latm languages. It necessarily followed that man, when

he first appeared upon earth, was destitute of language. Each separate tribe formed

its own language                                                                                and there could be no doubt  that  in each case the framers were
                                                                                             ;

aiTant savages, which was proved by the fact that the rudest tribes ever discovered

had ah-eady completed the task of forming a perfect language. The first rudiments

of language must have consisted of a few articulate sounds, in the attempts made

by the speechless but social savages to make then- wants and wishes known to each

other                         and from those first efforts to the time in which                                                    language had attained  the
                           ;

completeness which it was foimd to have reached among the" rudest tribes ever

known to us, countless ages must be presumed to have elapsed. The Eg^^tians

must have attained a large measiu-e of civilization before they had invented

symbolic or phonetic printing, and yet these were foimd in the most ancient of

their monuments. Dr. Adam Smith" di\-ided all languages into two classes, com-

plex and pimple ; the complex being considered the primary foi-m of all languages,

and the simple but derivations, the products of the intermixture of nations speakino-

different tongues, and striving to make themselves intelligible to each other. In

this case, one tongue would be adopted ; and, to make it easy of mutual use, it would

be stripped of its inflections, easy prepositions, &c., being substituted for them. It

was certain, however, that the principle could not be of imiversal or even general

application, and that there were many languages of simple stiaicture just as primi-

tive as those of complex formation. One language might receive even a consider-

able infusion of another without imdergoing any change of stmctm-e. There were

cases in which, from several causes, even the conquest of one people by another,

and the long possession of the conquered tenitory, might produce no change in the

structure of language. In some cases the invaders might be so overwhelmmg as to

be able to supplant the lajmiage of the conquered by their own, without the latter

imdergoing any change. In this way the Saxons substituted their own language

for the native idioms of Britain, that language not losing its inflections imtil it after-

wards came to be intermixed with the speech of a new set of conquerors. The sub-

--stitution of the languages of Em-ope for those of the New World was a case of the

same description even a stronger one. It was quite certain, however, that many

languages existed which never coidd have been formed by inflections. It appeared

that the structural character which languages originally assmned would in a great

measure depend on the whim or fancy of the fii-st rude founders. No doubt there

were facts in reference both to pronunciation and structure very difficidt to accoimt

for, and which might possibly have some relation to physical' differences of races.

No monosj-Uabic language, whether in the Old or New World, seemed ever to have

existed west of the nations whom we called Hindu-Chinese. Consonants, and

especially gutturals and other rough sounds, aboimded in the languages of North

Europe. The structure of the ancient languages of Em-ope, and perhaps of Central

Asia, appeared to have been formed by inflections, while the Malayan and Poly-

nesian tongues were invariably of very simple structiu-e. The American tongues,

--even the language of the Esquimaux, were formed by agglutination the combining
--in one_ word an aggregation of several words often to the formation of a word

comprising the meaning of an entire sentence. Adam Smith supposed (and he,

Mr. Cravrfiird, thought justly), that the fii-st attempts to foi-m language would con-

sist in giving names to familiar objects ; that was, in forming noims substantive.
Words expressing quality would naturally be of later invention. A'erbs, or words

expressing affirmation, must (according to the writer he had quoted) have been

nearly coeval with nouns themselves, since without them nothing could be affii-med;

and pronouns were not likely to have existed at all in the earlier period of language.
The same author said that number, considered in general, without relation to any

particular set of objects numbered, was one of the most abstract and metaphj-sical

ideas which the mind of man was capable of forming, and consequently was not an

idea which " would readily occm* to rude mortals who were just beginning to foi-m

a language," The truth of this view was cowoborated by our observatioa of rude
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                              193

languages, in which the process seemed to bo going on. Among the Australian

tribes " two," or a pair, made the extent of their numerals. Some other ti-ibes had
advanced to count as far as " five " and " ten." The Malayan nation had native

numerals extending to a thousand, above whicli they borrowed from the Sanscrit.
The rude and imperfect numerals of some tribes would seem to have been superseded
by the more comprehensive ones of more advanced nations, a remarkable example of

which was the general prevalence of the Malayan numerals among all the nations
of the Malayan and Philippine Archipelagos, among the tribes, whether fair or
negro, of the islands of the Pacific, and even among the negroes of Madagascar.
The Roman nmnerals had been adopted, to the supercession of their own, by tlie
Celtic nations. The two hands and the ten fingers seemed to have been the main

aids to the fonnation of the abstractions which Adam Smith considered so subtle.

This would account for the numeral scale being sometimes found binary, some-
times quinary, but generally decimal. However great the difficulties of construct-

ing languages, there was no doubt they were conquered by mere savages. Language
was even brought to perfection as to structure, and for the expression of ordinary

ideas, by men who were but barbarians. The poems of Homer, composed before

the invention of letters, were as perfect Greek as any that were ever after ^vlitten.
The Sanscrit language, in all its complexity and perfection of structure, was spoken

and written at least three thousand years ago by men who, compared with their
posterity, were completely barbarian. The Esquimaux had a language of great

complexity and structure. Languages, then, were foiiued everywhere by rude
savages, and time alone seemed to have been sufficient to enable them to elaboi-ate

a system perfect for its purpose with every race of man. The vocabulary of the
rudest tongue probably embraced not fewer than 10,000 w.»rds, every one of which
had to be invented. These words, in order to form a coherent system, had often to
undergo modifications of form, and some of them, besides their literal meanino-,

had to receive metaphorical ones. What ages, then, must not have elapsed from

the fii-st attempts to assign names to a few familiar objects, to that in which

language had attained the completion at which it had arrived, as we find it even
among cannibals ! Between the completion in question and the discovery of the
art of wi-iting, made only here and there, imder veiy favourable conditions as to race
and locality, how many additional ages must not have transpired ! That discovery
implied an advanced civilization, the fruit of very long time. If we considered
the introduction of the art of s\T.iting among the Jews, for example, to have been

coeval with the Pentateuch, this alone would cai-ry us back in the history of language
for near 3500 years, according to the usual computation. But at the time at which
the Pentateuch was written, the contemporary Egyptians were a far more civilized

people than the Jews, and had been long in possession of the art of writing. He
thought the conclusion was inevitable that the bii'th of man was of vast antiquity.
He came into the world without language, and in every case had to achieve the

arduous and tedious task of constructing speech, which, in the rudest form in which

it was now found, it must have taken many thousands of years to accomplish.

On the Ethnology of Finnmark, in Norway. By L, Daa, of Christiania.

   The district of Finnmark was situated at the extreme north of Nonvay and

--Sweden. Its population was very scanty, but was also very diversified ; there were

three great divisions : the aboriginal Laps ; the Norwegians, being immigrants
from Norway ; and the Fins, from Finland in Kussia. The former were chieflv
nomade, and the others were almost exclusively fishermen, living on the coast and
banks of the rivers. In 1855 the population of Finnmark proper was 15,.385

souls, and consisted of 5300 Norwegians, 1425 Nomades, 5786 settled Laps, and
2305 Finlanders. Each of the three nationalities spoke a different tongue. Mr.
Freiss, of Norway, had lectured upon the Laps and Fins, and from inquiries con-

ducted luider his superintendence a map was constructed, and from this .and some

statistics which had been given, the author drew conclusions to the effect that the

Norwegians and Fins were the more ci\ilized, and that while the Laps were learn-

          New Commercial Route to China.
By Henkt Dttckwoeth, F.L.S., F.G.S., F.R.O.S.

   The object of this commimication was to give a summary of a project recently
placed before the Government and commercial community of this country by Cap-

tain Richard Sprye and the writer of this paper.
   In his prefatory remarks the author observed that our most recent acquisitions of

territory in Bumiah had brought us within 250 miles of the Chinese frontier.
   There being no direct communication between the two countries, it became a

most important question whether it would be possible and profitable to establish

one.

   The seven most western and inland provinces of China proper are situated between
about 22° and 42° north latitude, and lie far west of the extreme point to which

Lord Elgin proceeded up the Yang-tze-kiang.
   The chief uatm-al productions of Yun-nan (area, 107,969 squai-e miles

population, 8 millions) are rice, silk, musk, various kinds of drugs, and tea. Gold,
copper, lead, cinnabai', find oi-piment are abundant ; indeed, Yim-nan excels all the

other provinces in its mineral wealth.

   Kwangsee (area, 78,250 square miles popidation, lOi millions) produces abim-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

dance of rice, cassia, au(L. valuable fumiture-woods. Gold, silver, and quicksilver

are the principal metals.

   Kweichoo (area, G4,554 square miles; population, 7^ millions) yields Avheat,
rice, musk, tobacco, cassia, and precious timber. Lead, copper, iron, and quicksilver

are foimd in its mountains.

   Hoonan (area, 7.3,000 square miles population, 33 millions), one of the richest
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

frovinces in the empire, produces immense quantities of grain, principally rice.
 ts teas are said to be remarkably fine. Iron, lead, and coal are abimdant; and the

movmtains produce pine, cassia, and various other kinds of timber.

   Sze-chueu (area, 160,800 square miles population, 30^ millions) is the largest
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and, according to Abbd Hue, the finest province in China. Its fertility is such
that, it is said, the produce of a single harvest cannot be consumed in it in ten years.

Its pi-incipal productions, besides grain, are indigo and various tinctorial plants, fine
teas, silk, sugar, gi-ass-cloth fibre (Bahmeria nivea), and manj^ kinds of -s'aluable

drugs.

   Shensee (population, 14| millions) is too cold for rice and silk ; wheat and
millet supply their place. Rhubarb, musk, wax, red-lead, coal, and nephrite are the

pi-incipal articles of exportation.

Kansu (area, Tvith the last, 154,000 square miles population, 22 millions) pro-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

cloths.

   The means of reaching these seven rich and densely-populated provinces from the

Bot of Bengal is very simple.
   Taking Rangoon as the starting-point, it is proposed to connect that port with

an emporium in the north-east comer of Pegu, i.e., imder the magnificent Karen
Hills. From this emporium, which woidd be almost equidistant from Rangoon
and the Chinese frontier, the line of communication would pass through Burman-
shan teri'itory to Esmok (or Sze-maou), a border-town of Yun-nan, and a point at

which several caravan-roads converge directly from various parts of the province,

and indirectly from the whole of the western half of the empire.
   In order to take-in chief towns and our military stations, the line would proceed

fhe waterslied between the Slttang and Youngsalen to the Kweestookee branch of

the Thaiboot riyer, and do-w-n their right or left bauljs to the Youngsalen, down

and across which to Tzeekameedac ; Gth, thence over the watershed between the

Youngsalen and the Salween to our frontier-line imder the Karen Hills, where we
are within reach of all the Chinese and Shan caravans which traverse the coimtiy

north-west of that point.

   Another most important featm-e in the project is the establishment of an electro-
telegraphic communication along the whole route. The line, once brought to

Esmok, could be easily carried across coimtiy to the Pearl river, and down the
lower valley of that stream to Canton and Hongkong, and thence, taking in
the principal towns along the coast (Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo, and Shanghai), to

Pelnn.

   In like manner, by extending the commimication to Niew-chiang, and down

the Corea, the open ports of Japan might be brought to the veiy door of Rangoon,
which already possesses telegi-aphic connexion with Calcutta.

On the Capabilities for Settlement of the Central Parts of British North America.

                          Bij James Hectoe, 3LD., F.G.S., F.B.G.S.

The region noticed by the author extended from Lake Superior to the Pacific

Ocean, lying immediately north of the boimdary-line of the United States, and was

Adrained principally by the river Saskatchawan.  considerable amoimt of agita-

tion had been employed in Canada and at home, in order to have this coimtxy thrown

open for settlement ; the whole, with the exception of that portion which fell within

British Columbia, being imder the direct control of the Hudson's Bay Company for

the purposes of a fiir-ta-ading monopoly. It had been placed beyond doubt, princi-

pally through the labours of several government expeditions, to one of which he

was attached, that there existed within these territories extensive areas, with good

and varied soil, adapted for agricidtitral colonization, but which, from their geogra-

phical position, were necessarily subject to all the advantages and defects of a tem-

perate continental climate. The winter was long and severe, the spring short and

imcertain, and the simimer tended to scorch the vegetation. The winter, however,

was not more severe than that which was experienced in Canada and elsewhere.

Many crops which were readily raised in Canada woidd not meet with equal suc-

cess in the Saskatchawan ; but all common cereals and green crops had been grown

successfully. The depth of the snow was never excessive, while in the richest

tracts the natiu'al pasture was so abimdant that horses and cattle might be left to

obtain their own food during the greater part of the winter ; and there was no

doubt that sheep might be reared, were it not for the immense packs of wolves

which infested the country. These remarks applied more especially to the

"Fertile Belt." The Saskatchawan coimtry offered a most desirable field to

the settler who was deficient in capital, and who had no desires beyond the easy

life and moderate gains of simple agricultural occupations. It was only the diffi-

cultv of access to it that prevented its inmiediate occupation. One route fi'om

AHudson's Bay, by a broken land and water carnage, was now almost abandoned.

second route wa.s from Lake Superior to Lake Winnipeg, which had the same disad-

vantages. The third line of ingress, undoubtedly the natural one, passed through

American territory, up the valley of the Mississippi river to the Red River settle-

ment, by way of St. Paul's, Crow Wing, and across the low watershed which

there divided the waters of the Mississippi from those flowing to Hudson's Bay.

The progress of the adjoining American settlements was then noticed. In the rug-

ged country which lay between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific coast, no

doubt all the valleys were filled with rich am'iferous deposits ; diggings were con-

stantly being discovered in fi-esh localities. The fonnation of a line of railway

through British Columbia woiild involve great difficulties. Throughout the Sas-.

katchawan country there were deposits of coal of considerable value, though not to

be compared with that which was common in England. Coal of somewhat better

quality also occurred at Vancouver's Island ; and that colony was a valuable link in

a chain of commimication with China and the East Indies, by way of a line of ron^e

across the Noilh American continent,

Oil the Relations of the Population in Irelaml, as shown hy the Statistics of
             Relir/ious Belief. Bi/ the Rev. A. Hume, LL.D., D.C.L.

   This paper was in contiuuatiou of au analj'sis whicli the writer had made of part
of the Ecclesiastical Census of Ireland for 1834 It referred to the two counties of

Down and Antrim ; and the results were published, with curious ethnological maps

in illustration of them. Of 135 benefices, some one class of the people rose to more

than 50 per cent, in 117 instances ; viz., Presbyterians in 70, Roman Catholics in

S6, and Established Church in 11.

   Looking only to the geographical counties (except in the cases of Dublin, Bel-

--fast, iind Carrickfergus), and omitting decimals, every 100 people are divided as

follows : Roman Catholics (or Celts) 78, Churchmen (or Normans and English

Saxons) 12, Presbyterians (or Scottish Saxons) 9, minor sects of Protestants

(mixed) 1,
   The Presbyterians are most contentivited, 94 per cent, of their number being in

Ulster, 3 in Leinster, 2 in Munster, and 1 in Connaught ; indeed, 60 per cent,

are situated in Down and Antrim, including Belfast; and if we add London-

derry and Tyrone, 81 per cent., or more than four-fifths, are in those four
shires. The Established Church has 58 per cent, of its members in Ulster,

25 in Leinster, 11 in Munster, and G in Connaught. It is therefore better

distributed. The Roman Catholics are best distributed ; viz., Munster, 31

Leinster, 28 ; Ulster, 22 ; and Connaught, 19. The great towns, being recruited

from the rural population round them, will in time become more Celtic or Roman

Catholic, just as Belfcist, which was originally English, has become Scotticised by

the influx of neighbouring Presbyterians.

   The three classes of population attain their highest and lowest relative propor-

tions at diiferent points of the country ; and in general the explanation of the facts

is simple. The Roman Catholics reach 97'71 in Clare, and shade off in Mayo,

Keny, Roscommon, Galway, &c., not falling below 90 per cent, in sixteen counties.
The Established Chiuvh is highest in Fermanagh, where it rises to 39 per cent, of
the gross population ; then in Armagh, 31 ; softening down in Belfast, Tyrone,

Dublin city, and Down county, in none of which do its numbers fall below 20 per
cent. Presbyterianism reaches its maximum at Camckfergus, 59 ; descending by

Antrim, 53 ; Down, 45 ; Belfast, 36 ; and Londonderry, 35 ; but in twenty-two
counties, embracing nearly the whole of three provinces, it does not reach 1 per cent,

of the gToss population.

  In general the numbers representing Churchmen (or English Saxons) and Roman

Catholics (or Celts) are the complements of each other, the descending figures in

tbe one case nearly corresponding with the ascending ones in the other. But five

or six of the lowest Roman Catholic numbers are baauced, not by Churchmen, but

by Presbyterians, as given in  the  previous  paragraph                                                    all  the  examples  lying in
                                                                                                        ;

tbe three shires of Do\\'n, Antrim, and Loudondeny, where the Scottish element is

strongest.

   Since 1834 the Presbyterian element has diffused itself, though still greatly con-

centrated. In general it is represented at the new points in the south and west by
a preponderance of males ; while the instances in which Roman Catholic males ex-
ceed the females are remarkably few. Persons of the former class find new homes

by the demands of trade and agiicidture ; persons of the latter class serve to swell
tlie tide of emigration which flows westward, the males being usually the pioneers.

These are only a few of the inferences suggested by the figures already given to

tbe public as anticipatory of the general census.

                                             under Mr. Geegokt.

    Sir R. I. Mui-chison communicated the substance of a letter he had received from
his Grace the Duke of Newcastle (Colonial OiRce), assenting to the recommenda-
tions of the Roj-al Geogi-aphical Society, that a sum of money exceeding that which
was originally contemplated woidd be guaranteed to Mr. Frank Gregory to complete
his explorations of North-Westem Australia. That traveller was to go northwards,
turn the north-west corner of the continent, and proceed as far as possible east-

wards towai"ds Cambridge Gulf. The colonists of Western Australia who first re-
commended this exploration had a moi'e limited object in view, wishing merely to
extend their feeding-groimds. The proposed exploration was one of the utmost
national importance at the present moment ; for the land thus explored was where

cotton grew as a native plant, and in abimdance. It was part!}' with a view to
ascertain some of the cotton-gi-o'ndng capabilities of this neighbourhood that the
exploration was about to be undertaken. The feat of M'Douall Stuart in crossing
the continent from South Australia to the northern watershed was one which the
Royal Geographical Society had recompensed by awarding to him their gold medal.

SeinarJcs on the Proposal to form a Ship Canal hctween East and West Loch

   The length of the proposed canal fi'om high-water mark on the one side to high-
water mark on the other would be IGOO yards. On the voyage between the Clyde
and West Highlands the distance saved would be fully sixty miles. Eighty years
ago the difficidties and dangers of the navigation had led to the consideration
of this proposal, and it was again brought forward in 1846, when the probable
expense was estimated at £101,267 18«. Qd.

On the Direct Overland Tclccjraph from Constantinople to Kurrachee.
  By Colonel Sir Henry C. Rawlikson, K.C.B., D.C.L., F.R.S.

In 1858 the Turkish Government imdertook to execute, at its own expense, a

line of telegraph from Constantinople to Buesorah, which would form an integral

f)ortion of the great line connecting India ^\-ith Europe. It was foreseen that the
 ine would be convenient both for the requirements of the Turkish trade and the

purposes of the Turkish Government, and would thus benefit the empire ; but the

money return for the outlay was to be sought in the tariff established for British

messages transmitted along the line towards India. The British Government en-

gaged, as soon as there was a fair prospect of the completion of the Turkish under-

taliing, to carry on the communication from Bussorah to India at its ovm expense.

Some of the officers originally engaged in the imdertaking had retired ; but three of

Lieut. Holdsworth's cmphyes, ISIr. Carthew and the brothers M'Cullum, remained

in the country, and, mainly o^^^ng to their zeal and sldll, the line was now in a

working and eflacieut state the whole way from Constantinople to Bagdad. The

Porte had declined to accede to a proposition that Her Majesty's Go\ernment

should incur half the expenses of the improvements, Ijut had formally engaged to

carrj' out all Col. Kemball's recommendations for giving greater efliciency to the

Aline at his own expense.  submarine cable from Pera across the Bosphorus

having been frequently damaged by the anchors of vessels, it was proposed to

suspend a wire from the European to the Asiatic side at the narrowest part of the

--strait a distance of not more than 1000 yards. Precautions had been taken as

security against interruption from the Arabs, Kurds, &c., bj' the line of telegraph

being taken from INIarden along the chain of the Masius, where there are located a

great body of Jacobite Christians. Col. Keniball reported favom-ably of the pro-

gress of efFoi-ts to conciliate the Ai-ab chiefs living near the outer ranges of the

Kurdish moimtains. The telegi-aph consisted of two distinct wires, one of which

was reserved for the exclusive use of the British Government ; and a convention

was about to be signed with the Tm-kish Government for the regulation of the

respective shares of the expense to be incm'red in keeping the line in working order,

for fixing the tarifi' for the transmission of messages, &c. With reference to the

Persian section of the line, attention was being more inunediately dii-ected to a

continuation of the land-line from Bagdad, through Persia, towards India. Political

and physical arguments showed the desirability of taking a northward line, and the

author believed that it had been decided to continue the line, in the first instance,

directly from Bagdad to Teheran, thence to Khanikeen and Kermanshah. From

the latter place it would continue to follow the gi-eat high road fi-om Babylon east-

wai-d. At Teheran the liae would joiu another system of telegi'aphs which had

been organized in Persia itself. From Bagdad it was proposed to continue the line

to Bunder Abbas                                                  and it was  almost certaiti  that  the Shah would  enter  cordially

into the scheme. The Commissioner in Scinde, the agent for the Government of

India, and the Imaum of Muscat had reported as favourably as could be wished.

They were working in what he believed; in the present state of oceanic telegraphy,

to be the only practicable direction.

Oil the Sjpitzhergen Current, and Active and Extinct Glaciers in South Green-

                             land. By Colonel Shaitniik.

    In June 1777, ten whaling vessels were beset in the ice about lat. 76° north,
between Spitzbergen and Jan Mayen. They endeavoured in vain to escape, were
carried by the ice in a south-western direction between Iceland and Greenland,

and by degi'ees the vessels were all lost ; only 116 of the 450 men who composed
the crews escaping, they having reached the 'South-Greenland coast. Little was
known of the loss of these vessels ; but it might be supposed that the floe ice was

not compact, and that they were chafed imtil then- hulls were worn, so as to permit

the water to enter them. On the 22nd of June, 1827, Captain Parry started on

--a boat expedition from Spitzbergen towards the North Pole one of the most

hazardous eflbrts known in Ai-ctic annals ; but he was obliged to put back on the

24th of the following month, and retm-n to his ship at Spitzbergen, the drift or
cun-ent having carried him 14 miles to the southwai-d in the last two days of the

journey. South of Spitzbergen and Jan Mayen the ice sometimes spread and came
south upon North Iceland, the gales north of Iceland and south of Spitzbergen

spreading the ice in detached pieces or small bergs eastwai-d, fi-om 100 to 200 miles
fi'om the cmTent track, which rims southward along the Greenland coast. Directly
west of Iceland, the floe ice had seldom been seen fi-om the highest moimtains.
South of Iceland, the ice-floe was in the direction of Cape Farewell. Timber was
often found drifting near the east and west coasts of Greenland. The width of the
Greenland ciuTent did not, in his (Col. Shafiher's) opinion, exceed 50 miles ; it

carried with it floe ice and berg ice. It was not known that much of the floe ice
came from the icy seas north of Russia. The year 1860 was remarkable for the

gi-eat quantity of ice brought by the Greenland current, and, added to that brought
south by the IBaffin's Bay and other cm-rents of Da\-is's Sti-ait, produced the unusual

dangers experienced in navigation from America to Europe in 1861. More ice had

been seen in the usual track of the steamers during this year than at any previous

period. This was to be expected after the reports from the ' Bulldog ' and ' Fox

expeditions of 1860. Captains of vessels fi-om Greenland reported that there had
been but little ice in the Greenland cim-ent this year ; and it might be expected
that navigation between America and Europe would be but little hindered by the

ice in 1862. When north-east winds blew, the coast was fi-ee from ice ; a west

wind di-ove the ice upon the coast. It might be safe to estimate the velocity of
the Greenland current at 10 nautical miles per horn- from north of Spitzbergen and
Cape Farewell, and then northwai-d to about latitude 64° north, where it began to
spread and join with the northern or Batfin's Bay cun-ent. The length of this
cm-rent being about 1600 nautical miles, and supposing its width to be 60 miles
during fom- months of the year, they might estimate the decay of ice from 75,000

to 80,000 square miles, within the track of the Greenland cuiTent. On the subject

of g-laciers, the Colonel expressed his opinion that the " Igalildio " was once an ice-

--fiord, that the glacier extended where water was now seen, the water reaching
--even more into the interior than the edge of the present glacier the moving of

the ice having groimd \w the rocks, and the earth and the small particles gradually
filling up the fiord. The supposed ice-area of Greenland bemg about 400,000
square miles, such an ai-ea ought, if all of it were ice, to give ofi" more upon the
known coast than was seen. It was reasonable to doubt the existence of such an

extent of ice.

The English Gipsies and their Dialect. By Bath C. Smaht.

The author of this paper was careful to explain in the outset that he did not

profess to deal with comprehensive questions relating to the Gipsj^ race as a 'whole,

but that his observations were limited to his own personal experience among the
English Gipsies. He began with a short description of the chief phj'sical and
psychological characteristics of the Romany people as they are now to oe met with

in England. In addition to then- swarthy skin and black hair and eyes, he re-
marked the prevalence among them of a weU-marked aquiline nose, and the

obliquity of the orbital arches, which slant upwards to the glabella or root of the
nose, combining together into one conmion arch, instead of appearing to be seg-

ments of two separate cii'cles, these several features foiming a tout ensemble having
an oriental cast strikingly different from the Anglo-Saxon physiognomy, or that of
any other British race. The latter and by far the larger portion of the paper was

devoted to the linguistic peculiarities of the English Gipsies. His remarks under
this head were based on a vocabidary, which accompanied the paper, of upwards of
800 words collected by himself during actual intercourse with members of various
Gipsy families. These words had all been minutely compared with Grellmann's
and Sorrow's German cand Spanish Gipsy Dialects, and their homologies traced
wherever it was possible. The following is a brief sketch of the remai'ks made on
the composition of words and of the various parts of speech and their inflections :

  A peculiarity of the Gipsy language wherever spoken is the munber of words

terminating in engro or menr/ro, escro or mescro, but the English dialect seems

especially rich in these compounds ; e. ff.,

Bockoromengro              A shepherd. From Bokoro (sheep).
Boshomengro                A fiddle.
Cooromengro                                   From Bosh (to fiddle).
Massengiy
                           A soldier. From Coor (to fight).

                           A butcher. From Mass (meat).

Sastermescro               A blacksmith. From Saster (iron).
Poggeromesty               A hammer.
                                                      From Pogger (to break).

But perhaps the most characteristic termination of aU is beti, or pen, added to ad-

--jectives and verbs to form substantives. This affix is also of frequent occurrence

in Hindustani :

Tatchipen                  Truth.             From Tatcho (right).
                           Victuals.          Fsom Hoi (to eat).
Hobben (for Holbeu)        Sickness.          From Naffilo (ill).

Naffilopen

   The Gipsies have manufactured and adopted a class of words, generally appella-
tives, which ai'e essentially of the nature of puns. They consist of words in which
a fancied resemblance of sound has suggested their translation into Romanes ; e. g.,

Lalopeero (red foot)                                      Redford.
Milesto-gav (donkey-town)                                 Doncaster.

Interchanges of certain letters fi'equently occiu: in Gipsy words, but always accord-

ing to rules ; and this must be borne in mind in tracing their derivations. Inter-
--K K Gchanges take place between the following letters
                                                      and 11, and T; and D,

F and S, &c., and the liquids are very often confounded,

Masculine nouns generally end in a consonant or o.

--200 REPORT 1861.

Femiiiiue uoiins nearly alwoys end in i or y; e. g.,

Adjectives end in o or y, agreeing in this respect with masculine or feminine

noims: e.g.,

              Chicldo (du-ty)

The comparative degree is fonned by adding dair or dairo ; but no pecidiar form

is met with for the superlative :

              Door (far) ....-,                                                           Doordair (fiu'ther).

The comparative degree is sometimes formed in-egularly :

              Cooshko (good)                                                              Fetterdairo (better).

   The English Gipsies still use a great many of their peculiar pronouns ; c. </.
Mandy (I), too (thou), j'ov (he), j-oi (she), j-aun (they), adoovvo (that), acoovoo
(this), &c. The second and third personal pronouns in the English dialect are thus

declined, viz.                                                       Thou.                He.                 She.

   According to Grcllmaun, tlio German and Hungarian Gipsies have a peculiar
conjugation of their own. The Gitanos of Spani assimilate their verbs to the

Spanish conjugation. In this country the Gipsy dialect still exhibits remnants of
its ancient mode of conjugating the verb, although it generally confonns to the
English method in jireference. Thus, the termination ella often appears in the tlikd
person singular of the present tense, and the past participle ends in o or do :

          Nasher (to lose) . . Nasherella (he loses) . . Nasherdo (lost).
Impersonal verbs always euc^in clla in the present tense; e.g.,

Brishinella (it rains)                                                                    Yivyella (it snows).

A special fonn for the perfect is met with in some verbs; e. g.,

Jill (to go). . . . Jas (he or she went).                                          Lei (to take). . . . Las (took).

   Parts of the A'erb to he have been retained in common phrases, such as " Choom
see aprey "=:the moon is up, "Snr «/;««? " = how arc you!''

   The Gipsies have a number of prepcsitior.s in common use; e.g.

              Engl. Gipsy prepositions.                                                   Hind, prepositions.

Remarlcs on a Proposed Railway across the Malay Peninsula. By H, "Wise.

    It_ appeared that this railway would save a distance of about 700 miles, by con-
necting the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean with the Gulf of Siani and China and
Japan Seas, and precluding the necessity of pm-suing the circuitous and precarious

navigation of the Straits of Malacca. The government of Siam had sanctioned the

construction of the railway, for the praiseworthy reason that it was connected with
the adyancemcnt of civilization. The length of ithe railway would not exceed forty-
five miles, and the transit of mails and passengers overland from the Bay of Bengal
to the Gulf of Siam, or vice versa, would be accomplished in two hours. The
present passage was made by steam-vessels in four or five daj^s, but wa.s seldom
performed by sailing vessels in less than three weeks. The experience of Major
Trernenheere, with respect to the proposed undertaking, showed that no great
physical difficulties would have to be overcome in the construction of this line.
The line would greatly facilitate the extension of the telegraph to China, by afford-
ing protection to the stations on the line. The cable from Kangoon, along Cochin
China, to Hongkong would be liable to far less casualties than that by the Straits
route. The district through which the line would pass contained coal, tin-ore, and

valuable natiu-al productions. In the neighbourhood M^as an abimdance of natural

woods. The entire area of the Malay Peninsula was about 83,000 square miles.
The importance of this railway to British policy and progress in the East was in-

calcidable.

        Address of "William Newmarch, F.R.S., President of the Section.

He said there was some danger at this time that imdue importance should be

attached to what had been achieved in phvsical discovery. Euoituous as had been

our achievements--beholding, as they did", the prominent efiects produced by rail-

--ways, tubular bridges, ocean steamers, telegraphs, and rifled cannon, there was
some danger--and it was not a small one--lest we should attach excessive and

imdue importance to the obligations which society owed to these achievements

Aand those discoveries, gi-eat as they were.                                    glance at the history of the last

thirty years would show that there had been in operation ecoaomical forces, the

effects of which were hardly of less importance. Sound doctrines had been ap-

plied_ to foreign and inland trade, taxation, education, sanitary science, prevention

of crime, and the poor-laws. Economical sciencie had ceased to be hypothetical,

and had become experimental. This, the prominent fact in the history of the last

thirty years, was due to the spirit of close scrutiny which had been carried into

everj-thing, including history, archseology^, literature, and politics. It had been

mentioned as a reproach to economical science, that it was not purely a science,

but partook largely of the nature of an art. He must confess that this was scarcely

a  reproach                                    and the  remark  arose  from  a  hasty  ^-iew of the real  diflerence  be-
                                            ;

tween science and art. Science was really a collection of general principles;

but all sciences were more or less arts. Astrononi}', for example, led to the

production o£ nautical almanacs; and physiology to hospitals, sanitary laws,

and precautions against fire. Economic science must be essentially an art, inas-
much as its smallest problems involved human interests, affections, and passions

and the advances which had been made of late years arose from regarding it both

as a science and an art. There was a great want of an accurate and* convenient

 term for social science, wliicli would include morality and religion, education, j mis-
 prudence, municipal law, sanitaiy science, political economy, the fihe arts, and the
 art of government. The Social Science Association had six sections ; namely, j uris-
 Erudence and amendment of the law, education, punishment and reformation, public

   ealth, social economy, and international laws. It was probable that social science
 would soon imply, technically, political economy, jmisprudence, sanitary science,
 education, and statistics. lie had mentioned statistics ; but statistics was not pro-
 perly a science, like d^mamics and chemistiy. Statistics had no body of doctrine,
 or of general laws, of its own. Its generalizations were of the second order. There
 were five main divisions, namely, vital statistics, criminal statistics, economical
 statistics, trade statistics, and taxation statistics. In all these, ultimate units were
 being gradually established. The annual death-rate was almost as important as
 Dalton's law of definite proportions. It had been established that the death-rate
in a commimity of human beings inhabiting a coimtiy like om- own ought not to
 exceed 17 in 1000, and taking their stand upon this, they were able to say that
 where the annual death-rate gi'eatly exceeded that figure, there was something wrong.
The rate of infant mortality was almost the best test of civilization. From the plan
 suggested by the Statistical Congress of last year, they should gradually be able to
ascertain what was the real condition, and what was the eflect, of the social relations
pervading diflerent parts of the world. The application of the expeiimental method
pm-sued dming the last thirty years had led to a large modification of the early and
 economic science in reference to free colonization, legal interference ^vith labour,
ciuTency prices, the nature and operation of rent, and the effects of a large increase
of metallic money. As to legal interference with labour, there was no part of poli-
tical economy appai-ently so cleai- as that which taught that capitalists and labom-ers

should be left to make theu- own bargain. Prior to Adam Smith and Ricardo,

nearly all such interference by law and custom had been mischievous ; and, there-
fore, expenence seemed to be on the side of laissez-faire, and against guilds, sj-ndics,
and govei-mnent ofiicei-s. This was true so long as the labom-ers were of the adidt
class, working singly or in small mmibers or in families. But it ceased to be tnie
when manufacturers congi-egated workpeople in large masses, and largely emploj'cd

women and children, who were only partially free agents. Capitalists said that the

limiting the hom-s of labom* would mischievously and fatally discom-age capital

--and so it would, in the abstract. But there were these qualifsdng conditions that

capital, depending for its retimi upon the order and energy of lai'ge masses of per-
sons, must take especial cai'e of the physical and moral condition of such pei-sons
and that the efficiency of exertion, even with machinery, did not mean unlimited
hom-s of labour, but skilled efibrts dm-ing the best-selected pai-ts of the day. The
experiment had fully answered ; and the orderly, educated, and contented labom-ers
of Lancashu-e were secm-ity against foreign competition, and a guarantee of peace.
Economic science dealt with six principal classes of questions, namely, the natm-e
of wealth, the exchange of commodities, taxation and finance, cm-rency and banks,
wages and division of employment, and interference by^the State. The last three
only were stiU in dispute. Formerly with regard to these the laissez-faire principle
seemed to be the general rule ; but as society became more complex, it seemed to

be clear that the State must in many cases protect indi\iduals. It could not be
denied that at present the tendency of ci^dlization was to deal with rights in masses.
The conclusion of the whole matter seemed to be, that as the residt of the last thirty

yeai-s, full as that period had been of scientific achievements, they might justly claim
for the ser\'ices rendered by economic science and statistical inquii-y a place in the

fi-ont rank ; that they had now arrived at a kind of intermediate point, at which,
after long debate, many conti-oversies were finally settled, and from which they
might see their way to a higher sununit ; and that the least doubtfid residt of their
experience had been the discovery that the most solid progi-ess was made by guiding

themselves in the main by close observation of facts, and by employing speculative
and hypothetical reasoning imder the most cautious conditions. But there was a
larger moral beyond these results. The last thirty years had been an age of re-
naissance, because they had found out that human life had higher ends than em-

plojmient in incessant labom- or devotion to excessive gain; that to accomplish
these higher ends they must free themselves bodily and wholly of artificial and false

supports, and contest -svith jio mimic earnestness for the honour of the fii'st place

                On Caijital Punishments and their Influence on Crime,
                                  By HJENET AsmvoRTH.

   From time to time, under the ever-varying condition of our people, an adjustment
of punishment for offences has been determined in some way or other by human

judgment, and, for the most part, the pimishment inflicted has been gi-eatly in

excess of the magnitude of the offences committed. The extremity of this policy

would appear to have been reached in the time of Hemy VHI., during whose reign

it has been stated that the incredible number of 72,000 persons were executed for the
crime of theft alone, besides those who suffered death for treason and other grave

offences. So fearfid an amount of legalized slaughter, committed on a population so

small, was calculated to have had a most impressive effect. And yet what do we find ?
Sir Thomas More, writing at that period, says, " Although so many were trussed
up, a man coidd not travel from his own home without fear of being either murdered

or robbed." It has been represented that Queen Elizabeth expressed her sm-prise

that men would be committing crimes at the foot of the scaffold ; and by way of

corrective of this gross sinfulness of her people, she gave orders that upon discovery

of the offenders they should be hanged without benefit of clergy.

   Dming the reign of the Stuai-ts and some of the Brunswick family, the number

of capital offences was gradually increased to the extent of 220, and the pecimiary
amount for the stealing of which death was inflicted descended to as low a sum as
five shillings. Coming nearer to our own day, the prevailing sentiment in relation

to almost all offences contiaued to rest upon the theory of the Legislatiu'e, that it

was needful to hang men by way of example, in order to prevent others committing

crimes. In the year 1786, James Holland, of Earkham, was condemned at the
Lancaster Assizes as a " croft breaker," having stolen 30 yards of cotton cloth, of
the value of £3, from the bleach grounds of Mr. Thweat, of Birrnden, near Bolton.

He wag conveyed in a cart fi-om the Castle of Lancaster to the town of Bolton,

and was executed there on the 18th September, 1786. Such was the avowed pm--
pose and determination that the most shovdd be made of the impressive effect, that

the employers of the neighbom-hood had their servants and work-people assembled
on the spot to witness the spectacle ; and upon the following Sunday the Rev. E.

WTiitehead, vicar of the parish chm-ch, improved the occasion by a sermon upon

the recent execution. Taking a retrospective review of the foregoing exposition
of one of the 220 cases in which the extreme penalty of the law might be inflicted,

the tarifl'of liability reduced to five shillings, and a theory of pimishments calculated

to inspire a terror of crime, how humiliating is the commentary of the reverend

\'icar, that " criminals daily increase, and rapine and villany are at their utmost
summit !" Indeed, it could no longer be doubted that there had been existing a
grievous misapprehension of what were the most judicious and enlightened means
to secure the end designed. Following a disclosure of the notoriously ill success of
extreme punishments, a committee was foiTned in London about the year 1808, to
afford assistance to Sir Samuel Eomilly, M.P., in obtaining the amelioration of our
criminal code; and their exertions were gradually successfid. One offence after

another ceased to be capital, and a change in om- penal code was more and more
urgently demanded. Public discussion of the subject brought about the acknow-
ledgment, with all the array of a new discovery, that it was not so much the
severity as the certainty of punishment which deters men from the commission of
offences. The difiicidty of procuring the repeal or even some mitigation of om'
antiquated penal statutes lay with the Legislature, and the character of the ob-
struction oflered will be estimated by reference to a few only of the accounts of the
proceedings. In the session of 18l0, Romilly succeeded in carrying^ through the

House of Commons the repeal of the law which made it a capital offence to steal
the value of 5s. in a shop. The House of Lords threw out the bill by a majority
of 31 to 11, and in this majority there were six bishops and one archbishop. From

a beginning so inauspicious to look upon, the progress of any salutary change could

--not be very rapid, and it was in 1833 that Lord Siiffield appealed to their Lordshipg

on the following astoiindinpr statement : " I hold in my hand a list of 555 perjm:ed

verdicts delivered at the Old Bailey in 15 years, for the single offence of stealing

from dwelling-houses ; the value stolen in these cases being sworn above 40s., but

the verdict returned being reduced by the jury to the value of 39a-. only." Wliat
Awas the residt of this appeal ?
                                  change in the law was eflected ; and ^h: Charles

--Phillips, in a remarkable pamphlet on capital punishments, published in 1858,

somewhat facetiously infomis us, " It did not amount to a rej)eal, but to an ac-
knowledgment that man, made in the image of his Maker, had risen in the money
market ; and thereupon himian life was advanced by statute from £2, the sum at
which it then stood, to £5, being a rise of (X)s. per hea'd." The effect of this change
in the law, as might reasonably be expected, was, that in like manner juries had

recourse to an exceptional vei-dict of £4 I9s. Sir Fitzroy Kelly stated in Parliament

in 1840, " That a few years before there were nearly 200 capital offences on the

statute-book ; now there were only 14, and that there had been no increase of crime

since the repeal." Mr. Hmne also remarked, " That in no instance had offences

increased in consequence of the mitigation of the punishment; on the conti-ary,

there had been a decrease ; so that, in future, capital punishments would be but an

imnecessary sacrifice of himian life." It will hardly be necessaiy to offer the remark

--that the security of property and the good order and general welfare of the com-

munity are the gi-eat objects of govei-nment ; how giatifj-ing is the acknowledg-

ment that these are now being upheld with gi-cater safety and without involving

any sacrifice of himian life, even of the meanest of oiu- fellow-subjects ! The_ people

of Lancashire do not feel indifference, but, on the conti-aiy, they rejoice -with the

rest of our coimtrs-men  in  the  mitigation  of our  penal  enactments                                       and, upon  an
                                                                                                           j

occasion such as the present, it maybe allowable, and not inappropriate, if we close

this review of the subject by some" brief reference to the effects, as they have been

disclosed by the criminal records of om- own county. From a Parliamentary paper,

it appears that in the com-se of 22 years, from 1798 to 1818, both inclusive, there

were in Lancasliire 153 executions, more than 50 of which were for offences con-

nected with forgery ; and let it be borne in mind that the population of the coimty,

in 1801, was only 672,565. In the last 22 years, the popidation of 1861 being

2,428,744, or nearly fom-fold, the number of executions has been reduced to 16,

and these for murder only. It may be insisted that any such comparison as that

of the number of executions does not afford conclusive evidence of the diminution

of crime and that, if possible, some other data, affording more minute particulars,
                                               ;

ought to be adduced in suppoi-t of this assumption. It is well known that in the

early part of the present centun- there were not in existence the means of collecting

the needfid information in the "same carefid manner as is now annually prepared by

the countv constabulary. In endeavom-ing to account for the presence or the absence

of crime, 'it -will be admitted that the employment of the executioner as a moral

teacher has ntterlv failed, and that the enactment of stringent laws has not pre-

vented the onward course of crime. VThen we come to consider the conditions

tending to crime, it is well known that the harassing eilects of poverty have been
but too frequently the originating cause. Vndor a pressure so severe, how hopeless

would be the attempt to enforce the conviction that "honesty is the best policy;"

whilst, on the contrary, eveiy one would admit that the meliorating influence of

  TJie Progress of Science and Art as dcvehped hi the Bleaching of Cotton at

                            Bolton. By Hexrt Asdwortk.

   Having traced the art of bleaching from its commencement to the present rime,
and described the present process, Mr. Ashworth continued to say that, by an art
which half a century ago was almost unknown, and by the agency of our coal as
fuel, we have succeeded in converting certain products which we dig from under
our feet, such as salt, pj-rites, and lime, into one of the most important branches of
manufacturing chemistry. Tliese discoveries in chemistrj- may appear extraordinary-,
although they are not more impoi-tant in the economy of bleaching than arc the

mechanical aiTangements which have superseded the exposure of labourers, in all
States of the weather, to the accustomed di-udgery of the " crofters " of old. The

" crofters," of whom we have spoken, bore the appearance of remarkably strong

men; their working dress was of thick white flannel, called "gladding;" the cut

of the coat was peculiar, having a loose, open appearance, and a low, fiat collar, on

which the shirt-collar usually rested. They had their necks uncovered ; and, their

employment being so much exposed to moistiure, they seldom wore stockings.

Altogether, they assumed a bearing of unconcern about the state of the weather,

and were quite regardless of the splashing of water. Their emploj-ment consisted

mainly in the handling of wet cloth, and in removing it, either by hand or by

wheelbarrows, from one operation to another. Perhaps the most distressing part

of their labom- was that of caiTying upon their shoulders a pile of wet cloth, rising

to some height above the head, which they conveyed to some considerable distance

in the fields, and spread upon the grass. In the severity of the winter season there

would be drippings from the cloth, forming icicles, which would be adhering to the

skirts of their clothing. It has been through a succession of mechanical inventions

that these laborious operations have been dispensed with, and one after another

they have been handed over to the power of the steam-engine. The result has

been that the time required for the operation of bleaching is now about as many

days as fonuerly it required weeks to accomplish. Honour to British genius that

these advantages have been derived to our country

The general public will, no doubt, feel curious to ascertain whether any and what

proportion of the money-saving thus effected has reached the consumer ; some other

portion of the public will inquire in what extent the advantages thus achieved by

--science and art have been shared by the operative class employed, it is not ex-

pected that much concern will be manifested about the interests of the proprietor

and it is not unreasonable to suppose that a still more minute inquiry will be raised

about the "human machine," more especially whether, during the progress of these

advances in manufacturing art, the material, moral, and intellectual condition of the

working class has been made to keep pace with all these improved manipiUations,

which, amidst the sti-uggle of changes, have destroyed the character of many

employments, but have greatly increased the whole number of persons employed ?

WeThe advantages shared by the consumer will easily be reckoned.  have before

us a printed card, or list of prices for bleaching, issued by a leading firm in the year

1803. At that time the charge for bleaching a well-known description of cloth

was 7s. Gel. for a piece of 28 yards, and it is now Gel The case of the labourers

employed in bleaching 60 or 70 years ago was, as before stated, a very harassing

one ; they suffered severely from exposm-e to wet and cold, and, as a consequence,

from rheumatism and asthma. The earnings of a "crofter " would be from 10s. to

15s. per week. Upon wages so scanty, and with some uncertainty of employment,

their mode of living was necessarily inexpensive. Oatmeal was the staple com-

modity of theii' food. They used it as porridge ; their bread was of oatmeal, either

in leavened oat-cakes or baked in the form of a loaf called -jannock, which is said

to have been introduced by the refugee Flemings ; and animal food, with the excep-

tion of bacon, was seldom foimd at the working-man's table. Now-a-days, the

workmen in bleach-works perform all theii' work indoors, and are therefore no

longer exposed to the coldness and moisture of the fomier period. The wages are

increased in a proportion which cannot easily be estimated, and their- employment

is one of gi-eat regidarity. They have nearly ceased to consimie oatmeal jannock

is unlieard of ; oat-cakes are seldom seen ; and their tables are now daily spread

with wheaten bread, animal food from the shambles, and all the other articles which

usually enter into the cousimiption of families in the other gi-ades of life.

The social condition of the operative bleacher of early times cannot easily be

separated from the rest of the working population of that day, neither coiUd they

now be described in any other manner than that which would apply to the opera-
Wetives around them in other piu-suits.

taking as aftbrding in itself a very appreciable indication of the past and present.

The amusements which fonuerly prevailed were rude and boisterous ; now they are

more refined and intellectual. Bull-baiting, bear-baiting, and cock-fighting were

amongst the common amusements of the day, especially at the wakes and fairs.

The game of foot-ball was a veiy favourite one, so much so that the people of one

place would make selection of their combatants and have them pitched against those

of some other place, and these would contend in very ardent strife for the renown

 of mastery. Indeed, so very popvdar was this ^ame, that a match at foot-ball was
 upon one day in the year tolerated by the inhabitants in the streets of Bolton. The
 whole of this is now given up. The game of cricket is becoming a popular one, and
 others equally harmless in their character are being introduced. Seventy j^ears ago,
 Sunday-schools had made but slight progress. There were but few pei-sons who
could read, still fewer who could write ; and when any one received a letter, he had
to cany it away, perhaps a good many miles, to find a scholar who coidd read it.
At the present time, Sunday-schools aboixnd, day-schools are numerous, and the

affair of carrying away a letter in search of a scholar may now with much compla-
cency be put down as among the reminiscences of seventy years ago.

                            England. By R. H. Bakewell.

         A Glance at the Cotton Trade. By Thomas Bazlet, M.T.
  A century ago the popidation of Manchester was below 30,000, whilst now

m350,000 persons reside and occupy it. Popidation and wealth have wonderfully

increased and ramified to other places ; but now, in the zenith of prosperity, a
mysterious hand has written upon our walls the words of caution and of admonition.
During the last fifty years upwards of 20,000,000,000 pounds weight of cotton from
all sources have been consumed in Great Britain, and the value would be probably
not less than £750,000,000 sterling, or might equal a sum of the amoimt of our
National Debt, the chief supply having been obtained from the United States of

America. Upon a fair computation, the import of that material, which has so

largely employed the capital and labour of this countiy, has yielded a profit of not

less than £1,000,000,000 sterling to the people of the United Kingdom within that
period. The wonder is, that so large a supply of cotton coidd be procured from
that one source, the United States ; and when we reflect that this country possesses a
monopolyof the vast extent of teiTitory foimd in the whole world capable of producing
this raw material, the inference is most palpable, that there has been developed the
most successful agricultural industiy in the States of America which has been
ever either contemplated or realized ; whilst in British colonies and dependencies
apathy and neglect have prevailed. If the legislature had little sympathy with the
great industry of Lancashire, the interests of our foreign possessions might have
induced our rulers to stimidate productions in them which woidd have foimd com-
pensating markets at home. Tlie advocates of large and of independent supplies of
raw cotton, from all possible sources, have never desired Governmental favours, their
object having been to promote the removal of repressing obstacles, and to procure,
by the aid of a soimd colonial policy, at least a fair share, in proportion to the ex-
tent of om- foreign possessions, not only of cotton, but of every other product which
they might more abundantly have yielded. During the last year the consumption
of cotton in Great Britain was 85 per cent, from the United States, 8 per cent, from
other foreign sources, and 7 per cent, from British territoiy. The present position
of the trade is most precarious and dangerous. Existing stocks and prospective
supplies of cotton may enable the niiUs to be worked into the spring oi next year,

at moderately fuU time; but afterwards, unless supplies be received from the
United States, independent sources can only furnish the means of keeping the mills

at work little more than one day in the week. With the gi'owth of this industry

5,000,000 of our population have become, directly and indirectly, dependent upoii
it for their subsistence ; and the productiveness of their capital and labour, inclu-
ding the raw material, was for the last year nearly eighty million poimds sterling.
Of this large value twenty-five millions of cotton manufactm-es were absorbed in
the consumption of the people of the United Kingdom, and there remained for
exportation fifty-five millions. The estimated capital engaged in its fixed and

floating investments is two hundred million pounds. Now, when we contemplate

the vast interests involved in this surjirising trade, seeing that the people employed
and connected with it exceed the population of the kingdom of Belgium, of Holland,

--and of Portugal, that the national treasury receives from it an amazing sum in aid
--of the expenses of the State, that a commercial marine of unparalleled magnitude
--derives .support from it, that the comfort and happiness of the labourers employed

in it are imperilled by any indications which threaten to disturb its existence and

--prosperity, and that its suspension or serious curtailment would even endanger
--the general weal, we may well inquire what efforts have been made to sustain the

usefulness, prosperity, and permanency of this source of national riches. That the

cotton trade shoidd have rested chiefly upon the one supply of the States of America

for its very means of existence, every good and every wise man has deplored ; but

that to produce that supply the portion of the human family which is most defence-

less shoidd be held in the degradation of slaveiy is abhorrent to the feelings of the

righteous, of the humane, and of the benevolent. Most effectually to suppress

slavery will  be to supersede  the  necessity for the  labom*  of  the slave                                      and  if  the

chiefs of Africa could be induced to cidtivate sugar, cotton, and tobacco upon their

own soil, they need not expel and degrade their laboui-ers.

The author added remarks on the effects of the conmiercial policy of the United

States, and affirmed that this countiy has been paying a tribute of five Tnillion

poimds sterling per annum to those States in excess of the price at which cot-

ton coidd be remuneratively produced and sold. With the convulsion which

exists in America, with the adverse conunercial policy dominant there, and with

the inhuman system of slavery which prevails in the cotton-producing districts,

what are the duties which devolve upon cm" governing and mercantile classes ? If
by the convulsion of the States we are taught our national as well as commercial

duties, the lesson will be idtimately beneficial. Whether it has been wise for our

Government to see continually increasing the dependence of this great trade upon

the one chief supply of its raw material, and that som'ce adverse in interest and

oppressive to its own labour, we can only answer in the negative. With the East and

West Indies, with tracts in South, East, and West Africa, and with land in Australia

as extensive as Europe, capable of gTOwing cotton fi-om the lowest to the highest

qualities, it is a national reproach to us that we have permitted our own fields to

be uncultivated, and that our spinners and manufacturers have been driven by

necessity to consume the produce of slaveiy. Lacking the means of commimication

and of irrigation, the resoiu'ces of the East Indies remain in much the same dormant

--condition in which they have been for two thousand years ; but brighter prospects

are opening in that gi'eat dependency, railways are being constructed, canals

formed, river navigation improved, and works of imgation promoted. One great

defect, however, is retained with pei-verse tenacity. The teniu'e of land is obstruct-

ive alike to the rights of individual ownership and to its effective cidtivation.

Without doing the slightest wron^ to the holders of any land, its equitable transfer

might be sanctioned, and a landed proprietary as influential as in om" own coimtry

might be established. Protection to life and the rights of property, with evenr

other just adjunct of good government, will inevitably lead to prosperity. Small

supplies of cotton, as good as that obtained from New Orleans, are now received

from India, and the cotton of this vast dependency is certainly improving ; but

whilst, from a combination of circumstances and causes, the ryot of India is only

paid 12s. per acre for his crop of cotton, and the American cultivator can obtain

£12, the energy and capability of the former cannot be developed. Supposing

efforts to be made commensurate with indicated difficulties, all the common cottons,

or 76 per cent, of the consumption of Great Britain, might be obtained from India

in a couple of years. From Egypt the supply of cotton may increase, but there the

withering influence of the despot retards its extended cidtivation, though the

spirited, energetic, and successfid enterprise of Mehemet Ali is an example deserving

the imitation of better men. He introduced that agi'icultural industry into his

viceroyalty, and founded a fountain of wealth whence flow millions of annual

income to the advantage of Egypt. For all the finer, higher, and better classes of

cotton, from New Orleans, Brazil, and Egyptian, to the most beautiful Sea Island,

Queensland, in Australia, might quickly afford all requisite supplies. That territory

alone, besides sustaining the population of Europe, coidd easily be made to produce
all the cotton now consumed in the world ; but so sweeping a change and enlarged pro-

duction need not be deliberated upon, the facts being only referred to as illustrating

the powers of that colony. In seeking from the Government the development of

the resources of the colonies, the twofold advantage woidd arise by which that power

would financially be gTeatly benefited, alike at home and in the colonies. Govern-

ment must set its coloniad house in order. Land grants for beneficial purposes

should be free, facilities afforded for emiqration, public Tvorks promoted, and pros-
perity will follow iu the train. Capitalists, merchants, and manufacturers, whose
investments are largely embarked in the cotton trade, have duties devolving upon

them. These bodies are known to have large investments in foreign railways, in
the cultivation of sugar and other products, and in many dubious securities ; but in
the cultivation of the staple raw material of their own pursuits they have not ven-

tured to embark. Last year the cotton trade contributed to capital and labour fifty
million pounds sterling, and in the last fifty years the aggregate reward has been one

thousand millions. Surely from these treasures might be spared some pittance of

capital to fi'ee the negro, and to ensure still greater prosperity to industry. Supposing
the Government of our country to be willing to make all the preliminary arrange-
ments which will contribute to the secmity and profit of capital invested in cotton-

growing, the clear duty of the class referred to will be to enter upon investments with

no niggard hand ; and, for their encouragement, it may bo mentioned that very

recently an extensive Louisiana cotton-planter has asserted that he could grow
cotton at 3d. per lb. which is now worth 9d. per lb. in Liverpool, and of course he
has had to buy his labom-ers, and afterwards to sustain them. The confessed profit
is 200 per cent. ; but, in all sobriety of judgment, cotton-growing would afford 100

per cent, of recompense. Here, then, the g-oveniing, the capitalist, the mercantile,

and the manufacturing classes have duties in common to perfonn, and from which
none of them should withhold their willing help. Upon this subject the warning

voice has been long and often heard, and the present embarrassment in cotton sup-

plies has been anticipated. Having, therefore, been forewarned, may this great

and world-benefiting industry be fore-armed !

On Ten Ymrs' Statistics of the Mortaliti/ amongst the Orphan Children taken
   under the Care of the Dublin Protestant Orphan Societies. By the Eev.

   W. Caine, M.A.

   There are two of these societies in Dublin, one for the childi'en of parents both

of whom were Protestants, the other for the childi'en of mixed marriages.

    Their distinguishing pecidiarity is, that the children taken imder theii care are
not congi-egated together in one large building, but are placed with poor Protestant

families in Wicklow and other counties in Ireland.

  A great saving is effected by this plan. Each child costs only between £5 and

£6 per annum. In the workhouse each child would cost about £9.
    V ery great care is used in the selection of the families in which the children are

placed. The minister of the parish reports to the Committee iu Dublin at stated
times whether they are properly attended to, and members of the Committee vLsit
them every year. This supervision tends to promote cleatiliness and sobriety in the
families with which the oi-phans live, as they woidd be at once removed if there were

any deficiency in these particulai-s.
   The happy result is seen in the exceedingly small amoimt of mortality amongst

the children. Their ages range from 6 mouths to 14 or 15 years.
   In the Protestant Oi-phan Society the mortality during the last ten years has

been as follows :

The average number of children during the last 10 years has been 101. The
average number of deaths has not been 1 per cent., as there have been only 8

deaths in the ten years.

    Conti-ast this mortality with that of the children in English and Scotch cities.

In Manchester 50 per cent, die before they are 5 years old ; in Glasgow, 54 ; in

Edinburgh, 38^ ; and in Aberdeen, .32 per cent. And throughout the kingdom half

the children die before they reach the age of 14 years.

   The exceedingly small mortality amongst the orphan children imder the care of
the Dublin Protestant Orphan Societies shows what attention to sobriety and clean-
liness, on the part of parents and nurses, and a proper supply of pure air would effect

--in this coimtry. It also shows to what a fearful extent murder prevails the murder
--of innocent children and the injiny which accrues to our o-^^ti country and the world

from the loss of the services and the labours of those thus cut off in childhood, and
thereby prevented from benefiting their country and the world, which they in most
instances would have done, if they had not met with untimely deaths at the hands
of their intemperate and uncleanly parents, and through the neglect of the com-
munity at large.

             On tlie Progress of Manchester from 1840 to 1860.

Mr. David Chadwick stated that, having been requested by the Committee of

Economic Science, at the last meeting of the British Association at Oxford, to pre-

pare a paper on the progress of Manchester and Salford during the twenty years

1840-60, he would consider seriatim the increase of population and that of the prin-

Sortion of parliamentary representation to persons and property ; the trade of the

istrict, with particulars of cotton imports and exports of manufactured goods;

improvements in cotton-machinery; wages of the operatives, with a comparative

statement of the cost of food and clothing, and facilities for their social, physical,

and intellectual advancement ; the municipal and local governments of Manchester

and Salford, noticing the taxation and local improvementa effected within the

period indicated.

Mr. Chadwick stated the population of the principal towns in Lancashire at each

decennial period from 1801 to 1861, showing an increase in Manchester and Sal-

ford, from 94,876 in 1801 to 311,269 in 1841, and to 460,018 in 1861, the rate of

progress being 47-79 per cent, in the last twenty years, and 384-86 per cent, in the

last sixtv years. Takmg the twelve principal towns of the coimty during the same

period, the increase was from 291,281 in 1801 to 929,405 in 1841, and to 1,417,662

in 1861. Comparing this progress with that of the entire county, and of England

and Wales, the rate of increase has been, in the twelve town districts, from 1841

to 1861, 52-53 per cent. ; and 1801 to 1861, 386-7 per cent. ; in the county, in

twenty years, 45-09 per cent. ; and in sixty years, 260-71 per cent. ; and in England

and Wales, in twenty years, 26-06 per cent. ; and in sixty years 125-6 per cent.

In 1801 the population of Lancashire was 7-68 per cent, of the total population of

England and Wales, or nearly l-13th part thereof. In 1861, the per-centage had

increased to 12-29, or nearly i-8th part thereof

The population in each township of the parish of Manchester, and in the parlia-

mentary boroughs of Manchester and Salford, in 1851 and 1861, was then detailed,

with the per-centage of increase in the ten years. It appeared that, owing to the

extension of warehouses, &c., used only in the daytime, and abandoned at night,

the population of the township of Manchester had decreased 1-04 per cent, during

the last ten years, whilst that of all the remaining to-wnships had increased, Chorl-

ton-on-Medlock being the lowest (25-99 per cent.) and Bradford the highest

(124-11 per cent.), the total increase in the parliamentary borough being 13-09

per cent. The population of the citj^ proper (not including Bradford, Ne-wton,

and Harpurhey) had increased 11-52 per cent. In Salford (parliamentary and

--municipal) the total increase in population was 20-33 per cent., detailed thus:

burv, 87-46.

This rapid increase could only be accounted for on the supposition that the occu-

pations of the people in the manufactuiing districts are more congenial, and afford

better remuneration, than agricultiu'al pursuits,

Mr. Chadwick then referred to a paper read at the last meeting of the British

Association in Manchester, in 1842, by Mr. Henry Ashworth of Bolton, showing that

the total value of property in Lancashu-e, in 1692, was £95,242 ; and in 1841,

portions of the increase being, in the three agi'icultural portions of the country,

3500 per cent. ; and in the thi-ee manufacturing hundi-eds (Blackburn, Salford, and

West Derby), 7000 per cent. The total assessable annual value of property in the

county was (as shown by a parliamentaiy return), in 1860, £10,458,243, being an

increase of £4,266,176 in twenty years, or 69-35 per cent. The total assessable

--annual value of propeiiy in England and Wales was, in 1860, £103,462,535, that

of Lancashire being therefore equal to 10-14 per cent, thereof.

Referring to the question of representation, it was shown that prior to 1832,

Manchester, Salford, and many other of the gi-eat towns of Lancashire were um-e-

presented in Parliament, but that the Reform Bill gave them 26 members (now

mcreased to 27). England and Wales returned 500 members, being one member

for £206,925 annual value of property, and 40,123 of population ; whilst Lancashire,

with its 27 members, had only one member for £387,-342 value and 91,281 popula-

tion. Thus, although Lancashire constitutes 12-29 per cent, of the population, and

10-14 per cent, of the annual value of property in England and Wales, the number

of its parliamentary representatives is only 5-4 per cent, of the niunber returned for

England and the Principality.

The great staple trade of the district was next considered. The tables imder this

head showed cotton imported into the United Kingdom from 1842 to 1845 inclusive
(four years) :--From the United States, 2,064,128,400 lb. ; all other countries,

608,476,800 lb. : total imports, 2,672,605,200 lb. (estimated at 400 lb. per bale). In

1846 to 1848 (three yeai-s) : United States, 1,366,796,1721b.; other coimtiies,

--288,787,8781b. ; total, 1,655,584,0501b. "^Tiilst in the three years ending 1860,

the figures were as follows : United States, 2,910,835,648 lb. ; all other coimti-ies,

740,4.34,352 lb. ; total, 3,651,270,000 lb. The imports were, in 1846, 467,856,274 lb.

and in 1860, 1,390,938,752 lb., being an increase in fom-teen years of 197 per cent.

Of cotton imported in 1846, the United States supplied 86 per cent., and all other

countries 14 per cent. ; in 1860, the United States, 80|^, and other countries 19J per
cent. Next followed a statement of cotton consumed, and manufactured goods pro-

duced in Great Britain, in 1830, 1840, 1850, and 1860; which showed, 247,600,000 lb.
of raw cotton consumed in 1830, against 1,083,600,000 lb. in 1860; the manufactured

goods produced being 182,954,658 lb. in 18.30, as against 886, 256,345 lb. in 1860. Total

mamifactured goods, in 1830, 914,773,563 yards ; in 1860, 4,431,281,728 yards, or
2,517,774 miles--a quantity which would -rn-ap 100 times round the globe'! Total

·Value of cotton goods pi-oduced, upwards of £77,000,000, a sum exceeding the total

revenue of the United Kingdom. The difference between the value of cotton manu-

factured and yams exported, and the total cotton imports, leaves 16J millions as the

value of labom-, &c., left in the counti-y fi-om exports of cotton manufacture alone

exceeding our total exports of woollen goods and yams, and more than double our

exports of silk and linen manvifactures. As a companion to the foregoing state-

ment, Mr. Chadwick also gave the impoi-ts of cotton, wool, silk, hemp, and flax, in

various years, from 1790 to the present time, annexing a table showing the num-

ber of factories existing in the United Kingdom in 1856, with other particidars

therewith connected. Nimiber of textile factories, 5117; spindles, 33,503,580;

--power looms, 370,195 ; total persons employed, 682,497. The motive power em-

ployed in 1856 appears to have been: steam= 137,711 horses; water, 2.3,724;

total horse-power, 161,435 (no later connected returns had been issued). Number

of spindles at work in cotton factories in 1860, 33,862,500, turning off 32 lb. of yarn

per spindle per anniuu. Deducting the exports in yam, 27,695,511 spindles, or

369,273 looms, remain. Total estimated value of spindles and looms emploved in

the manufactm-e of cotton in Great Britain in 1860, £41,247,960. Spindles, 84,656

horse-power; looms, 24,685. Total, 109,341 ; consuming 639,586 tons of coals in

 the year.  Increase in spindles and looms in the four years, 20 per cent.  Calcu-

lated in the same ratio, the niunber of operatives would be 455,055, which, at
9s. Qd. weekly average wages, would give the amount paid in 1860 as £11,239,857.
Our imports of merchandize and bullion amounted in the same year to £233,626,839;

exports, £191,205,421 ; or a total representing considerably more than one-half of

Athe national debt. table was then produced showing the exports from the United

Kingdom of ten of the principal articles of British and Ii-ish produce for each year
from 1846 to 1860. From this it appeared that the export of cotton goods from

1846 to 1860 increased from 1062 million yards to 2765 million yards, or 160 per

cent., whilst the value of cotton manufactm-ed goods exported was, in 1846,

£17,717,778 ; and in 1860, £42,141,505, or an increase of 138 per cent. The in-
crease per cent, on the other articles referred to was as follows :

The estimated number of spindles used in cotton factories, in 1840, was seventeen

millions ; in 1856, twentv-eight millions ; in 1860, thirty-three mUlions. Esti-
mated consumption of cotton in 1840,9,400,0001b.; 1850, 17,466,4001b.; 1860,

18,400,000 lb. Spindles made weekly in 1860, 60,000, or (say) three mUlions ia the
year ; of these, one and a half millions would be for home, half a million for re-
placement, and a million for foreign orders. Increase in the number of spindles in

the year, one and a half millions, equivalent to the production of 1,124,000 lb. of
23's j'arn. The annual increase in the cotton-supply required to meet the increase
of machinery in use in the United Kingdom, at this rate, would be 3100 bales, or

1,240,000 lb. ; to meet the increase of machinery made in the United Kingdom for
home and foreign use (deducting replacement item), 4687 bales, or 1,874,800 lb.
The improvement efl^ected in the various classes of cotton and other textile ma-
chinery during the last twenty years was then noticed. Since the invention by
Mr. Richard Roberts of the self-acting mule (known as "Sharp's Self-acting Mule"),
it was stated that there had been no single improvement of equal importance made
in the economy of the cotton-manufacture ; but many very important and valuable
minor improvements in working, in economizing labom-, in increasing speed, and
thereby increasing the production, both in spinning and weaving, had been effected.

In willow- and blowing-machinery, and carding-engines, the increase in production
had been 20 to 25 per cent. ; saving of labour, 20 per cent. : drawing-frames, in-
crease the same ; saving of labour, 100 per cent. : slubbing- and roving-frames, in-
crease the same ; sanng of labour, 40 to 45 per cent. : spinning- and doubling-ma-

--chinery, increase in'lenglh of machines, 100 per cent. average length of machines

in 1840 being 480 spindles, and in 1860, 960 spindles ; saving of laboiu', 50 per cent.
weaving-machinery, increase in production (in sizing-machinery, 150 per cent.),
looms, 25 per cent. ; saving of labom-, 40 per cent. Improvements of great import-
ance had also been effected in other branches, such as the introduction into general

use of chlorine, in bleaching ; the new dyes (magenta, &c., and from gas tar) ; the
sewing-machine, for making clothes, shoes, saddleiy, and nimierous other aiticles.
From a comparative statement of the actual iacrease of woi-k done by cotton- &c.
machinery in 1841 and 1861, it appeared that the estimated number of 33,000,000
spindles in 1860 would do as much work as 37,263,600 in 1840; but as there were

only about 17,000,000 spindles in 1840, it followed that the iacrease of the producing-
power was 119'2 per cent, in twenty years.

   The following statement of the proportion of adults and children in a cotton-mill
of 500 workers, and their average weekly wages, was submitted :

several ways in which the latter had been expended during the last forty years.

   Mr. Chadwick stated that he had been imable to obtain from the Manchester

Gasworks the necessaiy figures to enable him to institute a comparison between

the years 1840 and 1860, as to the quantity of gas produced, the gas-rentals, profits,

&e. He coidd therefore only fru'nish a few figures, which might be foimd of

interest :

            The Gas-Rentals were in 1843                                                                                                                                                                                                          £52,800

            ,, ,, ,, 1860                                                                                                                                                                                                                         154,600

In 1860, the price of gas per 1000 cubic feet was 3s. 8cl. to 4s. within the city,

and 6d. to 8d. extra outside the city ; the gross amoimt of the gas-profits was
£64,779 ; the total number of gas-meters in use in the city was 30,328 ; and the
number of street-lamps, 7116.

   In 1840, the quantity of water supplied by the Manchester and Salford Water-
works Company was If million gallons per day. In 1860, the quantity of water
supplied by the Coi-poration was 11^ million gallons per day. In 1840, the amount

received for water supplied was £22,400                                                                                                                                                                                       in  1860, £72,000.  The amoimt paid for
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the Old Waterworks by the Corporation was £538,000 ; and the amoimt expended

in New Waterworks, £827,000. Total cost of Watei-works, £1,365,000.

 --The Manchester Markets were pm-chased by the Coi-poration from Sir Oswald

Masley, in 1846, for £200,000, the value of property since piu'chased, and im-

provements efiected, being £63,000. The balance owing to Sfr Oswald Mosley and

other parties on mortgage, in 1860, was £161,000. The annual income from the
markets when pm-chased in 1846 was about £10,000 in 1860 the annual income

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

exceeded £20,000.

  A table showing the work done by the Paving, Sewering, and Highways Com-

mittee of the Manchester Corporation for the last thirty years was then produced :
Number of streets and covu'ts paved, flagged, drained, &c., 1502 ; length of streets,
60 miles ; area flagged and paved, about 205 acres. Main sewers constiaicted, 88

miles ; cross sewers and eyes, 49 miles ; total about 137 miles. The number of
siphon-traps which had been laid in streets, passages, yards, courts, and houses
were 12,299. [Mr. Chadwick stated, as an addendum to these tables, that the

cost of paving and sewering an area of 960,400 yards of streets in Manchester, from

1830 to 1860, had been £311,623 9s. ; whHst in Salford, from 1844 to 1860, 232
streets had cost £61,546.]

   The criminal statistics of Manchester showed the number of persons appre-
hended, and how disposed of, for each year from 1841 to 1860. It appeared that,

whUst in 1841, with only 317 police officers, there were 2962 convictions out of

13,345 an-ests ; in twelve months, 1859-60, with 617 as a police force, 4900 were
convicted out of 7387 arrested. From a retui-n prepared by Captain Lane, the

governor, it appeared that in 1851 there were 303 prisoners in the city gaol. The
cost per head per day was 19|rf. ; the net earnings of the prisoners, £162 in the year,

leaving the net cost per head per day, after deducting earnings, 19Jf/. In the yeax
ending March, 1861, the average number of prisoners was 508 ; the cost per head per
day, 12|(/. ; the net earnings of the prisoners, £2776 for the year, leaving the cost per

head per day, after deducting earnings, 9^d. Two tables related to the local Courts

of Eecord, showing the actions instituted and their results (in Manchester. 1858-60 :

total writs issued 10,475, for £136,188 ; in Salford, 5792, for £71,834). Mr. Chad-

wick then referred to a brief and curious statement of the history, objects, and

powers of the Court Leet for the Hundred of Salford (now nearly obsolete in ftmc-
tions), with its public stocks and other chastisements and penalties against " eaves-
droppings, waifs, and iiTegiilarities on public commons ; "' " rogues, vagabonds, and
sturdy beggars," " card- and dice-plajang, and suchlike unlawful games."

The charitable and benevolent institutions of Manchester and Salford were then

and 47 days in 1860.

The statistics of sendees rendered by the Manchester Fire-Brigade, in the thiiv

teen years 1848-60, were also noticed, sho\ving property saved to the extent of

£5,900,364, and destroyed, £854,373. There had been no augmentation of the

strength of the brigade, which nimibered 51 men.

Passing to the consideration of the figures appertaining to the Manchester and

Salford Savings' Bank, it was remarked that habits of forethought and pru-

dence had taken a deep hold on the Lancashire mind, in Manchester especially.

The  number                              of  depositors      in  1840 was 13,453                                                                              in 1860,  49,227.  Total amount

1840-60, £224,653. The classification of depositors (as shown in the Association's

last report) revealed some highly interesting facts.

The educational was the last branch alluded to by Mr. Chadwick. Manchester

(he said) was decidedly great in its Sabbath-school organization. The gathering in

Peel Park, on the occasion of Her Majesty's visit, of nearly 80,000 teachers and

children, would not soon be forgotten. The eighteenth annual report of the Salford

Simday-School Union (March 1860) gives the number of teachers as 674, and

scholars 7766 ; number of Simday Schools (exclusive of Roman Catholics, of which

no complete record had been received) in Manchester and Salford, 201, comprising

--about 90,000 scholare the afternoon attendance averaging about two-thu'ds, or

60,000. There were in the Sunday-Ragged-School Union 17 schools, with 402 teachers,

and 3678 scholars ; 35 night-schools, with 1483 scholars ; 15 ragged schools had

penny savings' banks, in which 1316 children had deposited £278 ; one of these

ragged-schools had also been made a night-asylum for destitute children, besides

which there was one school not in the union, with about 300 scholars.

The present average attendance at day-schools in Manchester was stated as

81,923                                   in Salford, 9925 ;  total, 41,848.                                              And in Simday-schools, in Manchester,
                                      ;

42,687 ; in Salford, 16,354 : total, 59,041, as particularized in the following tables,

hooks of the jail in order to apply the results to an examiaation of the data sup-
plied on the above subject by M. Quetelet, in his work ' Siu- I'Homme.'

   The residt is given in a series of tables. It leads to the inference that the niunber
of persons measured and weighed by M. Quetelet was, in almost every instance, too
small to afford trustworthy indications. It also affords some reason for supposing
that, on the whole population of this coimtiy, a general scarcity of food has a per-

manent effect on the average height of the generation bom in the same year. The

Observations on the Manufacture of the Human Hair, as an Article of Con-
                 sumption and General Use. By William Danson.

   The author submitted for inspection specimens of articles manufactured from the

--human hair two shawls, cotton wai-p, and which appeared to be of a veiy massive

and heavy textm-e, and showed that was capable of being made into the finest fabrics
for ladies', like the alpaca. In consequence of the above, the author received a com-
mimication from Leipsic stating that one firm is regularly consuming 12,000 lbs.
annually of human hair in manufactured goods. It would appear fabidous to say that
100,000 or 200,000 bales might be obtained perhaps 500,000 or a million could be

--The Aid noiv granted by the State toivards the instruction of the Industrial
   Classes in Elementary Science its Nature and Results. By Capt. Donnelly,
   B.E., Inspector for Science of the Scieme and Art Department.

   The Science Division of the Science and Ai-t Department is constituted to encom-age

the teaching of science throughout the United Kingdom.
   The branches of science thus aided are divided into seven heads or subjects, and

each of these into two subdi^dsions, except the first, which is divided mto three

subdivisions.

   I. Practical Plane and Descriptive Geometry, with Mechanical and Machine-

          Drawing and Building-Construction, or Naval Architectui-e.

 II. Mechanical Physics.
III. Experimental Physics.

 rV. Chemistiy.
  V. Geology and Mineralogy.

 VI. Animal Physiology and Zoology.
VII. Vegetable Physiology, Economic and Systematic Botany.

   Assistance towards iosti-uction m. these sciences is afforded in fom* different forms,

viz. :

   A. Allowances to teachers on their certificates.
   B. Public examinations, in which Queen's medals and prizes are awarded to all
successful candidates, whether taught by a certificated teacher or not, held at aU

places complying with certain conditions. On the results of these examinations
certificate allowances and payment on residts are made to the teachers.

   C. Payments on prizes to certificated teachers.

   D. Grants towards the purchase of apparatus, &c.

    1. Certificate allowances to certificated teachers.

   In November of each year the Department of Science and Art holds an examina-

tion at South Kensington in all the above-mentioned subjects. Any one may attend

this examination without pa\Tnent of fees by sending in his name to the Secretaiy,
Science and Art Department," in September, and may take up any one or more of the

subjects or subdivisions at one time.

    Certificates of three grades are given for success in these examinations, entitling

the holder to the following scale of payments :

For a first-gi-ade certificate in any subject  £20
Second
Third                                            15

 218 REPORT 1861.

    At the first examination for teachers in November 1859, shortly after the publi-

 cation of the first minute, 57 candidates came up, of whom 43 were successful

 taking 65 subdivisional certificates. The next year, 1860, 89 candidates came up ·
 75 were successful, and 121 subdivisional certificates taken.

     If the successful candidate holds an Education-Depai-tment certificate, he is paid

 on that also in addition to the certificate of the Science and Art Department. The

--teacher obtains the certificate payments in the following manner : The classes are

 examined once a year (see below, Public Examinations) ; and then for every pupil

 of the artisan class who passes such an examination as will qualify the examiner in

 reporting that his instruction has been sound, and that he has benefited by it, the
teacher receives £4 of his certificate allowance. The artisan class is broadly defined

Aas including all who are in the receipt of weekly wages, and then- children.

pupil on account of whom paj-ment is claimed must have received forty lessons at

least from the teacher since the last examination at which payments were claimed
on his account.

  A conmiittee must be formed of at least five well-known persons in the neigh-

bourhood, who have to give the necessary vouchers that certain conditions have

been strictly complied with. Thus, then, for a teacher to obtain the fuU benefit of
his certificates, including those from the Education Department, at least a quarter

as many students of the industrial classes must pass at the May examination (see

fom-th head of inquiry), in one or more subdivisions, as his certificate allowances
amoimt to pounds ; if more pass, he receives no more payment under this head, but
if less, then for every one under, £4 less.

    2. Public examinations.

    In order to test the efficiency of the instiniction, on the proof of which alone the

payments are made to the teacher, an annual examination is held in May simul-

taneously all over the kingdom, an evening being fixed for the examination in each
subdivision of the seven subjects.

   It is conducted by the conmiittee previously mentioned, to whom the examination-

papers for the pupfls in each particular subdivision are sent.

   The results of these examinations are classified by the professional examiners of
the department imder three heads, in lists which are published.

  AU --1. those who have^jossec? in each subdivision of a subject, the standard of

attainment required being low, and only such as will justify the examiner in re-

porting that the instruction has been soimd, and that the students have benefited
by it.

   2. From among those who ^j««sef7, those who attained a degree of proficiency

qualifying them for the Ist, 2nd, or 3rd-clfT8s Queen's prize.
    3. The six most successful candidates in each subject throughout the United

Kingdom, if the degree of proficiency attained be sufficiently high to waiTant their
being recommended for Queen's medals.

   The Queen's prizes consist of books to be chosen by the candidates from lists

furnished for that purpose, and are imlimited in number.

 --The Queen's medals are one gold, two silver, and three bronze, in each subject

for competition, throughout the United Kingdom.

   At the last examination in May there were just 1000 papers, and of these 725

were passed, and would qualify- the teacher for pajmient if they were of the indus-

trial classes and had received forty lessons ; 310 of these received Queen's prizes,
59 Ist-class, 100 2nd-class, and 151 3rd-class, while 4 gold, 21 silver, and 16 bronze

medals were awarded.

   Although payments to the teacher are made only on pupils of the industrial
classes, others are not excluded from examination. Any person may present him-

self or herself, but the local committee is permitted to charge a fee not exceeding

2s. Gd. to cover the expense of gas, &c. Such candidates are eligible to receive

Queen's pi-izes.

   3. Payments on prizes to certificated teachers.

   Besides the above payment on certificates to the teachers, there are other pay-
ments which are not limited in amoimt, as in the case of the certificate allowances.

   For eveiy pupil of the industrial classes who obtains a Queen's prize, the teacher,

--if he is certificated and has given the pupil 40 lessons, receives a payment £3 if

the pupil obtain a first-gi-ade Queen's prize, £2 if a second, and £1 if a third.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  219

   This amount is not limited ; and at the last May examination many teachers ob-

tained £30 and £40, from this source, in addition to their certificate allowance.

    4. Grants toivanls the purchase of apiMratus.

  A grant of 50 per cent, on the cost of apparatus, diagi-ams, &c. necessary for the

instruction of the class is made. These gi-ants are limited to £10 to schools taught
by a master who is not certificated.

   The above payments on accoimt of science-teaching are made by the Science and
Art Department, and, I. are only made when the holder is employed in teach-
ing a school or class not imder inspection by the Education Department, but in
connexion with the Science and Art Department ; and the lessons must be given in
Mechanics' Institutes and other places not receiving grants from the Education

Department.

   II. The teacher must give instruction in a day or evening school or class for the
industrial classes, adults or boys, approved by the Science and Art Department, and

open at any time to the visit and inspection of its officers. Any teacher employed

in a day school under inspection of the Education Department must first have ob-
tained the pei-mission of that department to teach in such school or class.

   III. The certificated master of an elementary school who has pupil teachers ap-r
prenticed to him cannot receive the science-certificate allowance even if holding a

science certificate.

   Certificated teachers of elementary schools who have not pupil teachers ap-
prenticed^to them have their time out of school-hours at their own disposal, so far

as_ official regulations are concerned, and may, if further certificated in science, give
scientific instruction imder the Science and Art Department.

          On the Recent Improvements in the Health of the British Army.

                                      By Dr. W. Pake.

 _ The defects of the health of the Amiy, which had been before manifest in the

figm'es of returns, struck every heart when they appeared in the thinned ranks be-

fore Sebastopol, in the sick-fi-eighted ships on the Black Sea, and in the hospitals

of Scutari. Mr. Sidney Herbert, from his position, felt the defects perhaps more

acutely than any, and since that time, neglecting the ease and enjoyment which a

splendid fortime placed at his command, he devoted himself to the sanitary reform
of the Army, first in a Royal Connnission, then in commissions for canying out its

recommendations, and lastly as Secretary of State for War in Lord Palmerston's

Administration. Notwithstanding the heavy duties of that office, he continued
to act on a Royal Commission, of which Lord Stanley is the chairman ; and some

of his last recorded words were inquiries into the means of saving the numbers

of soldiers who are destroyed in hundreds every year by the bad sanitary an-ange-

ments rather than by the climate of India. His frank and winning manner,

his knowledge of his subject, and his eloquence enabled him to overcome many
obstacles ; and he had some courageous colleagues, among whom he (Dr. Farr) must
name as the foremost Florence Nightingale. Happily, before his death Lord Herbert

witnessed some of the residts of his measm-es : he saw the marvellous sxiccess of
the China expedition ; and he received the first annual report of the Du-ector Ge-
neral of the medical department of the amiy, showing " a remarkable reduction in

the mortality of all classes of troops." Lord Herbert was not satisfied with point-

ing out evils in a report. He got Commissions of practical men nominated by Lord

Panmure, placing himself at then- head, to remedy those evils. The labours of one
of these Commissions were described in a recent Report by Dr. Sutherland, Dr.
Burnett, and Captain Galton ; and its measures for improving the sanitary condition
of barracks and hospitals were so weU conceived that they desei-ved to be studied

by all who took an mterest in the health of ai-mies. The Sanitary Report of Dr.
Logan and the Medical Repoi-t of Dr. Mapleton, with the accompanying papersj
proved that sanitary and medical science had much to expect from medical officers.
The Commission for canying out improvements in the vital statistics of the Army
laid down an elaborate and yet simple plan for the observation, record, and analysis
of sickness, diseases, and casualties of the Army imder various circumstances at
home and abroad, in peace and in war. That plan was now in operation. He

trusted the remarkable weekly reports would soon be promulgated, showing, as
                                            ;;

they did, very marked contrasts in different regiments. Having quoted returns to
show that a manifest diminution had taken place in the mortality and sickness of
the army, Dr. Farr continued by saying that, upon examination, it had heen found
that the great causes of the excess of deaths in the army were completely under
control in all ordinaiy circumstances ; and as they varied, their eflPects varied. If
the measui-es that had been begun were completed, there was no doubt of the result

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and if the causes of disease were studied under the new system of observation esta-
blished by Lord Herbert, improved means of guarding the mechanism of the human
frame woidd be discovered, and would accumulate year by year. As instances of

the remarkable improvement in the health of the ai-my in the United Kingdom, it

may be mentioned that, while the annual muuber of deaths to 1000 of strength

during the years 18-37-46 was, in Infantry regiments, 17"9, in the Foot Guards
20'4, in the Royal Artillery 1.3'9, and in Dragoon regiments 13'6, the mortaUtv fell

in the year 18.59 to 7-6 in Infantiy regiments, to 9'1 in the Foot Guai-ds, to 80 in

the Royal Artillery, and to 8-0 in Dragoon regiments.

On Sanitary Improvements. By Mrs. Fisoisr.

On the General Results of the Census of the United Kingdom in 1861*. By

 James T. HAitjriCE, F.S.S., Assistant Commissioner of the Census in England.

   The author commenced by describing the machinery which had been used for
collecting the census in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Channel Islands.
In England, .30,862 enumeratoi-s were employed : in Scotland, 8075 ; in Ireland,
5096 men of the constabidary force, 15 of the Coast Guard, and 17.3 of the
Dublin constabidary ; and in the Channel Islands, 50 supeiintendents were
emploj'ed. and under them 260 envmierators. In the United Kingdom, including
the superintending officei-s, there were altogether 48,730 local agents. In this num-
ber was not included the Custom-House officers and others employed to enume-
rate persons in vessels. The proportion of enumerators to the population was
much larger in Scotland than in the rest of the country. In England the average
number of persons to each enumerator was 655 ; in Ireland, 1091 ; while in Scot-
land it was 379. To this anny of local officers, minute printed instructions and
and blank schedules for distribution at every house were furnished fi-om the central
office. From the London office alone the printed papers for^^arded before the cen-
sus-day, by post and railway, weighed about 45 tons, which was equal to 4200
reams of ordinary foolscap paper. In Ireland, besides the usual information as to
the number of houses and persons, the heads of inquiiy included the educational
status of the people, their religious profession, the number and causes of death,
and other details connected with vital statistics. These last items would have been
a needless addition to the census, were not Ireland stiU the only part of civilized
Eiu-ope not possessing--and, judging from the proceedings of last session, not

--soon likely to possess a system of registration of births, deaths, and marriages.

Fortimately the tranquil state of the coimtiy allowed the men of the constabulary
to be spared to cany out these large investigations ; and they undoubtedly pos-
sessed peculiar qualifications for the task entrusted to them. The want of uni-
formity bet«-een the returns made from Ireland and other parts of the L^nited
Kingdom was a di-awback to the general utility of the census in some respects

but all classes had readily joined in affijrding the fuUest information. In this
country no motive existed for concealment or falsification of the nimibers of the
people. There was no suspicion of the returns being used against the public in
reference to taxation or military ser^dce, as was the case in several of the con-
tinental states. The number of persons residing in the British islands on the 8th

of April last was 29,058,888. The men in the army, navy, and merchant sei-vice
out of the coimtry, either abroad or afloat, amounted to 275,900. The total popu-

   * The figures cited in this paper, with respect to the population of the United Kingdom
in 1861. were derived from the preliminary abstracts presented to Parliament, but stated
to be only approximately correct, and stUl subject to final check and revision. Since the
Meeting at Manchester, the revised numbers for England and Scotland have been published
those for Ireland, however, have not yet been declared. The population of England and

Wales, according to the Census returns of 1861, is 20,066,224; of Scotland, 3,062,294.

lation, therefore, of the United Kingdom, including the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, might be set down at 29,334,788. The male population of the United

Kingdom, including the absent soldiers and s?ilors, was 14,380,634 ; the female

population was 14,954,154 ; the females, therefore, exceeded the males by 573,520.

To every 100 males there were 104 females. The disproportion of the sexes in this

country, no doubt, existed long before it was made apparent by the census of 1801,

and of late years it had evidently been increasing. It was well known that, in

England, of children born alive 105 boys were born to 100 girls ; and the proportion

was nearly the same in Scotland and France. The males continued in excess of

the females imtU the seventeenth year, when the nimiber of the two sexes was

nearly equal ; at subsequent ages the females were always in excess of the males,

the change in the proportion being doubtless mainly diie to a difference in degree

of the dangers to which the sexes were exposed, to emigration, and to a lower rate

--of mortality amongst females. The gross population of the United Kingdom in

1801 taking an estimate for Ireland and the islands in the British seas, not then

--enumerated might be set down at 16,095,000. In sixty years, an addition of more

than 13j millions had been made to the inhabitants of the countiy, besides the vast

numbers who had left to foimd and people new colonies in Australia, or crossed

the Atlantic to settle in the United States or the colonies of America. For the

whole period of sixty years, the numbers showed a rate of increase amounting to

82 per cent., or on an average 1-01 per cent, annually. Dm-ing the first half of the

Eeriod (1801-31) the rate of increase was more than twice as rapid as in the second
  alf (1831-61). There was little emigration in the first thirty years ; whilst the

returns of the Emigration Commissioners furnished an account of nearly five mil-

lions of emigrants who sailed in the second period. The great seats of manufac-

tming and mining industry had maintained their rate of increase. This had espe-

cially been the case in the group of disti-icts having Manchester for a centre, which

Ahad increased to the extent of 274,000 persons since 1851.                                    vast increase had

also taken place in the localities having their centres in Birmingham (187,000);

Newcastle (158,000) ; and Liverpool (106,000). London had increased 440,000,

and now contained a population which woidd soon reach 3,000,000. On the other

hand, a decreasing population had generally been shown by the retiu-ns from the

agricultural  districts                                        but  how far  this  might  be traced to special  circumstances,
                                                            ;

such as the diminution of employment consequent upon improved methods of cul-

tivation, and the substitution of the breeding of stock for tillage, and how far to

other causes inducing the unskilled labom-er to migTate from the coimtry to tovsms,

might form a profitable subject of investigation. An increase of population usually

implied  increased happiness ;                                      but the  converse was not  equally true                                                for the inha-
                                                                                                                                                        ;

bitants might decrease without necessarily suffering privation and misery. Great

anxiety had been felt on the subject of the residt of the inquii-y into the religious

denominations, which, for the first time, formed part of the decennial census in

Ireland. In obtaining these returns the enumerators met with every facility from

the clergy and people ; and, as onlj' 15 complaints had been made about them, the

--Commissioners infen-ed that they were nearly correct. The following were the

results in round numbers : Roman Catholics, 4,512,000, or 78 per cent, of the

whole ; members of the Established Chm-ch, 682,000, or 12 per cent.; Presbji:erians,
588,400, or 10 per cent. ; all other persuasions, 8740 : the Jews were only .322. The

religious persuasions of the ai-my and navy not having been distinguished, they

were here distributed in proportionate numbers under the several denominations.

The total nimiber of Protestants in Ireland was 1,280,000, giving the Roman

Catholics a majority of 3,232,C00, or about 3-5 Roman Catholics to one Protestant.

Even in "Protestant Ulster" there was a Roman Catholic majority of 17,000.

A comparison of these numbers with the residts of a special census of religious

professions taken in 1834 showed that during the generation that had passed since

that inquiry, while the population of Ireland had diminished by 2,190,000, the

Roman Catholics had diminished by 1,945,000, the numbers of the Established

Chiu-ch (with the Methodists) by 130,000, the Presbyterians and other Pro-

Atestants by 115,000.                                          new era had happily dawned for Ireland, although clouds

stiU obscured her horizon. Evidences of the increasing material prospeiitj^ of the

countiy were not wanting ; and it might confidently be anticipated that the census

of 1871 would show by figures the effects of social changes now in progress. The

islands in the British seas and the Isle of Man had a population of 143,447, or 321

more than in 1851. These islands, having been resorted to from motives of economy
by persons possessing small independent incomes, increased in population at the
rate of 18 per cent, between 18.31 and 841, and 15 per cent, in the following decade;
but free-trade measures having deprived them of their special advantages, the num-
bers had remained stationary since 1851. According to the latest returns and
official estimates, the population of the North American colonies was not less than
3,795,000, and that of the Australian group was 1,273,0)0. For the West Indies
might be set down 990,000 on the authority of the well-known blue books. The
Cape and other African Colonies contained 870,000 inhabitants ; Ceylon, 1,754,000
Mauritius, Hong Kong, &c., 280,000. In Europe, Malta, Gibraltar, and Heligoland
contained about -304,000. To these an enormous addition must be made for British
India, stated by Mr. Hornidge, of the India Office, to contain (exclusive of the na-

tive and foreign states) not less than 135,442,000 souls. Add the population of

the United Kingdom, and the result was what might truly be called a " grand
total" of 274,000,000 of subjects of Queen Victoria. With regard to the mother
country, increased intelligence, combined with the new discoveries of science, and
the powerful inventions in aid of industry which had sprung up on every side, and,

far above all other causes, the benefits conferred by the steam-engine, the railway,

and free-trade, left no doubt that the material prosperity of Great Britain, and
consequently the number of her people, would continue to increase.

                On the Inspection of Endoived Educational Institutions.

                                            Bij J. Heyavood, F.E.S.

   The author stated that the Roj^al Commissioners, in their recent Report on Popu-

--lar Education, had laid down the following important principle with reference to

endowed educational institutions : " That the power to create permanent institu-
tions is granted, and can be granted, only on the condition implied, if not declared,

that they be subject to such moditication as every succeeding generation of men

shall find requisite." This principle has been acted on ever since the Reformation,
but it has never been distinctly expressed. Acting on this principle, and adopting
as a basis the suggestions of Mr. Cumin, an assistant commissioner under the Royal

Commission, the following recommendations had been prepared :--" That one of the

CharityCoimnissioners should be an Education Commissioner, appointed specifically
for that subject. That the Charity' Commission should be brought into connexion
with the system of the Committee of Pri\'y Council on Education. That inquiries
into endowed educational institutions, under the Charity Commission, should be

conducted, as they are at present, by Government Inspectors. That no new educa-
tion scheme should be passed by the Charity Commissioners until it had obtained
the sanction of the Vice-president of the Committee of Council of Education, who
is always a member of the House of Commons. That ordinances of the Charity
Commission for the improvement of educational charities and for the conversion to
the pui'poses of education, wholly or in part, of charities which are mischievous or

useless as at present applied, be laid before parliament in the schedule of a bill,

similar in form to inclosure bills." The author then instanced several examples
of the want of local power to carry out desirable changes in the case of charities
and endowed schools, including the Manchester Free Grammar School (income
£3000), the Leeds Grammar School, the " Blanket " Charities of Manchester, &c.

He said, it would be better that some small payment should in general be made by

the parents for their children's education. According to the authority of Mr. Cumin
the assistant commissioner, demoralizing results had accrued from the distribution

of such charities as Clarke and Marshall's Charity in Manchester. Fictitious
names had been used ; relations had recommended other relations ; some of the
recipients were drunkards and bad characters, whilst others were receiving con-

siderable wages. He fully agxeed with the commissioner, that no one having

childi-en shoidd be able to share in such doles, unless they sent their children to
school. Passing from Manchester, he showed that the malversation of sums left
in endowments was pretty general throughout the countrj', instancing (on the au-
thority of Mr. Fearon) the case of an important school in the Eastern Counties, in

which, there being no demand for Latin or Greek, and the master selected being
determined to teach nothing else, he continued to receive his salary, though no

scholars came, and the building fell into ruins. Masters of endowed grammar
schools were commonly not prepared to teach anything beyond the classics and

mathematics. , Persons intimately connected with general educational pursuits

shoidd be enrolled amongst the Charity Commissioners. In the Leeds Grammar
School, the Rev. Dr. Hook had the influence to obtain an enlargement of the

plan so as to modify the erroneous legal decisions with respect to the limitation of
grammar school instruction to Latin and Greek. The Hoyal Commissioners had re-

commended that the Charity Commissioners should merge into the Committee of
Council on Education. At present the Charity Commissioners had not sufficient
independent power to act. It had been foimd that a proposed change for the better
in Coventry had provoked an opposition ; and it was relinquished because it indi-
rectly influenced the return of members of parliament. The general principle laid
down by Mr. Cumin was, to do the best they could for their own day, instead of
strictly following the will of the founders. The Charity Commissioners resided in
London, and had accounts presented before them comprising fidly two millions of
money. They received an enormous amount of documents, which required arrange-

ment and classification.

    On the Condition of National Schools in Liverpool as compared with the
                 Population, 1861. By the Eev. A. Hume, LL.D.

   In 1853 a paper was read at Hull, before this Section of the Association, on the
same general subject, and by the same writer. The present one brings down the
facts and principles to the present time. The records which have been preserved at
the Blue-Coat Hospital enable us to compare the progress of schools and of educa-
tion with that of the population. The following are all Church schools :

        Decennial
--224 REPORT 1861.

    If we add 30 per cent, for those who are not regularly at school nor retained on
 the books, but who still come and go, and thus get an in-egular education, we have
21,947 who may be said to be under education in these schools. If we increase,

 at the same time, the numbers which were reached in 185.3 for schools of all other

kinds (nou-sectarian schools, and those patronized by Roman Catholics and Pro-
testant Dissenters), we have 18,359 additional pupils. This gives us a total under

 education of 40,306.

    In the Church schools there are 419 teachers of all kinds, or one for every 52

pupils. Only 83 are certificated, and many of the others are pupil teachers in their

 earliest years.

   The gross number requiring education in the national schools of Livei-pool has

been computed at 73,979, of whom it appears that only 54 per cent, are fonnally

(though sometimes imperfectly) educated. The remaining 46 per cent, comprise
several classes, e. g. those who attend ragged- and Sunday-schools only, those who
receive knowledge like food, irregularly and insufiiciently, and those who receive
the practical education of vice and immorality.

   The sites of the schools are particularlj' deserving of consideration ; and we are

fortunately enabled to examine the facts minutely, in connexion with the recent

census of the borough, returned in ecclesiastical districts.

    These figures do not show the full extent of the unequal distribution of educa-

         _

 tion, because in the first portion nearly all the children should attend schools of
 this class; while in the third, where the rich reside mainly, education should be
 almost entirely self-supporting. In four of the best eccle.siastical districts the po-
pidation is 22,486, yet there are 2421 children educated, or 10-77 per cent. In one
 district, St. Savioui-'s, the per-centage rises to 17-25. In six poor districts there

is a joint population of 99,361, and the Church educates in like manner 1822, or
1-83 per cent. In foui- other districts, the popidation of which amount to 33,208,
there are no national schools.

  --The cost of educating these 21,947 is to the to-wn about £10,956 per annum ; and

the distribution of the amount is as foDows : donations and subscriptions 28 per
cent., chm-ch collections 10, children's pence 44, and all other sources 18. This,
of coui-se, is independent of the interest of money expended in land and buildings,
and includes none of the Government annual pa}^nents, except capitation fees.
The average is nearly 10s. per head ; but the largest portion is paid to the rich
districts, where it is least required, and the smallest portion to the poor districts,
which most need it. The children's payments are usually Wd. and Id. but in

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

two or three schools they rise to 6f/., in six others to 4f/., arid in four or five more
to Zd. In some of the schools in the lower parts of the to-wn the children can
pay nothing whatever ; and at one district-school it is fouud necessary to educate
about 50 per cent. free.

   Hence it follows that -the district or parochial system is good, but is badly applied.

Men subscribe to the rich community in n'Wch they live, and withhold aid from

the poor one in which they work and accumulate property. If the necessities of one

be five times as gi-eat as those of another, while at the same time pecimiary aid is

obtained -with only one-fifth the facility, the task of educating the people at one

part -will be twenty-five times as gi-eat as at another. The Committee of Council
mterpret the word " parish " as meaning in to-wns a circle of five miles" radius ; but
practically it refers to a much naiTower limit.

   The Liverpool Church of England School Society supports three sets of schools
entirely, and votes small sums as a rate in aid to otters.

3 schools, -with 1100 pupils, receive £500 a year.

· 10 ,,  ,, 2529 ,,                 ,, £145 (£10 to £25 each).

   If the number of schools assisted were extended and the amoimt of aid increased,
the evils arising from the coexistence of riches and poverty in the same to-wn would

be greatly modified.

            On the True Principles of Taxation. By C. E. Macuueen.

   The paper consisted of a comparison of the divei ;e character of direct and indi-
rect taxation ; and its object was to show that the action of the latter was always
injurious, and that direct taxation was the only on* consistent with sound financial

Srinciples. Of various schemes of direct taxation, three were mentioned as most
 esenmg of attention, although the Financial Reform Association did not commit

itself to their advocacy. The first of these plans was the Land Tax of William III.

according to its original intent, with a small capitation tax in addition, as suggested
by the author of the ' People's Blue Book ;' the second the American system,

taxing only real propertv and personal estate above the value of £50 ; and the third,

the plan recommended in the draft report of the late Joseph Hume to the Income

--Tax Commissioners of 1852, based on capitalizing all incomes, a scheme supported

by Dr. Fair and others.

                                                      On the Progress of Cooperation at Eochdale.
                                                         By the Eev. W. N. Moleswokth, M.A.

The rapid progress and difiusion of cooperation is effecting a gi-eat change in the

condition of the working class, and in its relations with every other class. It has

therefore naturally excited much interest and attention. What has been done in

Eochdale may be done elsewhere                                                                                                                                                          the experience which has been gained there may
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

serve to guide and encourage societies which are in an earlier stage of their progress,

and may enable us to loi-m some sort of rough estimate of the proportions that co-
Aoperation may be expected to assimie hereafter.
                                                                                                                                                                                        careful examination of a single

case will be the best preparation for forming a sound judgment respecting the whole

movement.

The first thing that seems to be requisite is to give some sort of definition of the

principle which is embodied in these societies; and I cannot do this better than by

copying their o^-n statement of their objects.

" The objects of this society are the social and intellectual advancement of its

members                                               it provides them with groceries, butcher's meat,                                                                                  drapeiy goods, clothing,
                                                   ;

shoes, clogs, &c. Theie are competent workmen on the premises, to do the wowc

--of the members, and execute all repairs. The capital is raised in £1 shares, each

member being allowed to take not less than five, and not more than one hundred,

--payable at once or by instalments of three shillings and threepence per quarter.

The profits are divided quarterly as follows : 1st. Interest at 5 per cent, per annum,

on all paid-up shares                                                                                                  2nd.  2i per cent,                                               off" net profits for educational purposes, the
                                                                                                                    ;

remainder divided amongst the members in proportion to money expended. For

the intellectual improvement of the members, there is a library consisting of more

than 3000 volumes. The librarian is in attendance every Wednesday and Satur-

day evening, from seven to half-past eight o'clock. The news-room is well supplied

with newspapers and periodicals, fitted up in a neat and careful manner, and fur-

nished with maps, globes, microscope, telescope, &c. The news-room and library
Aare fi-ee to all members.
                                                                                                                             branch reading-room has been opened at Oldham-road,

the readers of which meet eveiy second Monday in January, April, July, and Octo-

ber, to choose and sell the papers."

   This statement is given at full length : though there are some portions of it which

may seem not quite relevant to our purpose, yet it contains nothing which does

not throw some light on the spirit in which the society has been conceived and

canied on. In sciences which have been canied to a high pitch of perfection,

such as astronomy and the physical sciences, accuracy of definition is indispensable
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but in the less advanced and more complex questions of social science we cannot

define with the same degree of strictness, and it is much better to make our boim-

daries include too much than to render them too narrow.

drapery goods, clothing, shoes, and clogs." Yet this jitstaposition indicates a con-
fused sense of a very important truth, and one that gives to cooperation a far
hio-her value than seems at first sight to belong to it, namely, that the material or
financial progress is the basis and the measm-e of the intellectual and moral pro-
gress : for increased wealth implies an increased command over the necessaries of
life · it therefore implies more leisure ; and though this leisure may sometimes be
abused, it will, as a general ride, be rightly used, and especially by men who have
pm'chased it by industry and self-control. There have, no doubt, been cases in
which increased wealth has been attended with the most fiightfid moral dissolu-
tion and intellectual decay ; but this has arisen not from the wealth, but from the
excessive inequality of its distribution. But when the wealth of a society is equi-

--tably distributed through the various classes that compose it -when it is allowed,
m feet, to take its natural and noi-mal course, then the material progi'ess be-

comes the instrument and the condition of every other kind of progi-ess. When,
therefore, we trace, as I shall now proceed to do, the financial history of the Roch-
dale Co-operative Society, we are roughly indicating, be it rememljered, the gene-

ral intellectual and moral progi-ess of its membei-s, of which, as I said before, the
material development is the measm-e.

   In the year 1843, when the " Rochdale Equitable Pioneers' Co-operative Store "

commenced, the New Poor Law had prevented the operatives of Rochdale from re-

garding parochial relief as a som-ce on which they might always rely in case of loss
of work, and of those periodical crises to which our manufacturing system has
always been liable. The recent failm-e of the Rochdale Savings' Bank, which had
been plundered to a fearfid extent by its accountant, had destroyed all faith in that

popular institution ; and the Rochdale operatives, who looked beyond the present

moment, seemed to have no alternative but that of hiding theii- little sa\dngs in an
old stocking, to be brought out of its place of concealment when the day of distress
arrived. It was imder these circumstances that twenty-eight Rochdale operatives
contributed a sovereign each, for the pm-pose of establishing a shop, at which they
inio"ht pm-chase genuine gi-oceries and other articles of ordinary consumption at a
moderate rate. It was an experiment which had often been tried before on a
laro^er scale, and apparently imder more favourable auspices ; but, from the causes

we have mentioned, the condition of the Rochdale operatives was desperate, and,
lilie brave men, they determined not to succimib, but to make another eflbrt and

hope for better days.
   The following Table, taken from their Almanack for the year 1861, gives a very

good view of the operations of the Rochdale Society from its commencement to the

close of last year :

    After the society had been earned on for seven years, it was found that more
capital was offered to be invested than could be profitably employed in the store.
At the same time there were great complaints of the quality of the flour sold in the
shops, which was supposed in many cases to be greatly adulterated. In fact, there
was at the time a very strong feeling on the subject of adulteration everywhere;
and this feeling very natiu-aUy applied to flour, as a chief constituent of food, more
than to any other article. The consequence was that in the year 1850 a Co-opera-
tive Corn-Mill Society was established, for which a substantial mill was built in
Weir-street, Rochdale, the financial progress of which is exhibited in the following

table :

This capital consists of actual money, or stock purchased by monej', and which

might very fairly be estimated at a value considerably above its cost price.

  Now let us pause for a moment to consider the progress that has been made.

   But this does not by any means represent the whole of the financial co-operative
progress in Rochdale. Several other societies have come into existence, which,

though independent of this Society, and not recognizing so clearly as this Society
the principles of cooperation as laid do-wn by it, are nevertheless societies which
receive and develope the resources of the working-classes, which tend to raise them
morally, socially, and intellectually, as well as materially, and which must not,
therefore, be wholly left out of our accoimt in estimating the progress which

cooperation has made in Rochdale. It would be foreign to my present purpose

to enter into an enumeration of their operations. I only refer to them in order that
the Section may understand that the progress described in this paper is very far
from representing the whole of the results of the principle of cooperation in the

tovra of Rochdale.

    There is one thing to which I would advert before I leave the subject, which is
greatly to the credit of the principal promoters of this movement, and is all the

more necessary to be mentioned, because the contrary is sometimes asserted. I
cannot, of course, speak for all of them ; but, as far as 1 have had an opportunity of
obsen'ing them, I have been struck with the absence of that IcA-elling spirit and of
that desire of self-aggrandizement which has characterised some of the working-
class attempts to elevate themselves. The chief ambition of the principal promoters

of the movement in Rochdale appears to me to be to raise themselves by raising

 the class to which they belong, vdthout desiring to leave it, and without the slight-
 est wish to depress or injure any other class. Their object and their ambition

--appears to be that the workiug-class should be well fed, well clothed, well housed,

 well washed, well educated in a word, that they should be respectable and re-
 spected. If any taint of the socialist and communist theories in which the society

 originated still cleaves to them, it is being rapidly worked off, and will, I am per-

 suaded, shortly disappear. And, to their honour be it spoken, so far are they from
 trying to monopolize the advantages they have acquired, that they are animated by
 a generous spirit of proselji:ism, and put themselves to considerable trouble and ex-
 pense in communicating to inquirers from all parts of the kingdom the results of

 their experience, and aiding them in the formation of new societies. The follow-

 ing extract from a paper they have printed for the use of persons wishing to form

 new societies will sen-e to illustrate this remark, and will I am sure, be listened

 to with interest by the Section :
     " 1st. Procure the authority and protection of the law by enrolment.
     " 2nd. Let integrity, intelligence, and ability be indispensable qualifications in

 the choice of officers and managers, and not wealth or distinction.

    " 3rd. Let each member have only one vote, and make no distinction as regards
 the amoimt of wealth any member may contribute.

     " 4th. Let majorities rule in all matters of government.

    " 5th. Look well after the money matters. Punish fraud, when duly established,

 by the immediate expulsion of the defrauder.
     " 6th. Buy yom* goods as much as possible in the first markets ; or, if you have

  the produce of your industry to sell, contrive, if possible, to sell in the last.

     " 7th. Never depart from the principle of bujing and selling for heady money.
     " 8th. Beware of long reckonings. Quarterly accoimts are the best, and shoidd

  Stock ' at least one-fourth less than its marketable value.

     " 10th. Let members take care that the accoimts are properly audited by men
  of their own choosing.

     " 11th. Let Committees of Management always have the authority of the mem-

  bers before taking any important or expensive step.

" 12th. Do not court opposition or publicity, nor fear it when it conies.

" 13th. Choose those only for your leaders whom you can trust, and then give

them your confidence."

The principles by which the society whose progress has been described is distin-

guished from the numerous joint-stock societies established vmder the Limited

Liability Act appear to me to be these :

1. To make the material improvement of the working-class subservient to their

social and intellectual advancement.

2. Neither to give nor take credit.

   3. To keep the governing body under the constant and vigilant superintendence

of a proprietary resident on the spot, and the greater part of whom are acquainted

with the nature of the operations carried on with their capital. This is a cause of

their success to which, I believe, attention has not yet been directed, but which is

very important.

On these principles two questions arise

1. Are they sound ?

2. Are they applicable to manufacturing operations, as well as to stores for the

sale of goods ?

On these questions I do not profess to dogmatize. I see this institution esta-

myblished and carried on for sixteen years under  own eyes. I am naturally desi-

rous to investigate its character ; it is an inquiry of no small importance, and one

which I think ousrht to receive the careful attention of this section.

On the Price of Printing Cloth and Upland Cotton from 1812 to 1860.
                                   Bij Alderman Neild.

By two tables (which are printed in detail) he showed the price of a description

of cloth known as |-72-reed printers, in each year, from 1812 to 1860, by which is

meant 72 threads of wai-p in the inch, and the best class of this description of cloth

has 88 threads of weft in the same space. This description of cloth is now in part

superseded by a ~ cloth, which, assuming it to be of the same quality, will measure

in the grey 25 yards long and 36 inches wide. Although the ^ are giving place to

mf, the comparison in ^ was continued throughout. The present difference value

between an 80-and a 72-reed wiU be about 9d. per piece. He mentioned a remark-

able circimistance, showing the astonishing superiority of power-loom cloth over

hand-loom. As buyers of cloth, they applied a very close scrutiny to every lot of

cloth purchased, as to the warp, weft, length, breadth, and weight. The accuracy

--with which one piece compares with another in all these particulars, in the produc-

tions of first-class makers, was surprising the item of weight, however, being the

one in which the greatest difference is to be apprehended. But even in this, the

difference the first makes in large quantities of cloth would not be more than

about five ounces in cloth weighing 5 lb. 2 oz. (that is, taking a number of pieces,

and weighing each piece singly) ; but taking the average of a number of lots of 20
pieces each, thus extending over thousands of pieces, they will not vary more than

from 1 to 2 oz. ; whilst, taking the case of the 80-reed cloth named in the first six

years of this table, a variation was found in cloth pui-porting to be the same of from

51b. 1 oz. to 6 lb. 4 oz. The two most remarkable years were 1814 and 1825. The

first (1814) was soon after the Continent had been closed to our manufactures for
probably 20 years, and when it was believed (to quote a saying of the time) " there

wovdd not be a piece for every village." The excitement became intense, and 80-

reed grey printing-cloth rose from 25s. per piece to 49s., and one style of prints rose

Afrom 44s. id. to 63s., or from 19d. per yard to 2s. 3d.  much superior article of

the same class is now sold for lis., or about 4fd per yard, so much better, both in

design and execution, and brilliancy of colour, that, if the production of 1814 were

placed side by side with the production of 1860 at two-thirds of the price, the price

of 1860 would be taken, and the one of 1814 left. The year 1825 was one of extra-

ordinary speculation and excitement, principally, if I remember rightly, in raw cot-

ton. The manufacturer endeavoured to keep pace by advancing his cloth, and f -72-

reed printing-cloth rose, in that year, from about 13s. 6d. to 19s. This, however,

had the effect of almost putting a stop to the demand ; and sales, except to a very

limited extent, were out of the question. The result was, a great accumulation of
--230 · REPORT 1861.

stocks. The iisury laws were then in force, and, in consequence of the very high
rate of money, maniifa cturers were driven to most terrible sacrifices upon their stocks.
At length, prices began to give way ; and the cloth in question fell from 19s. to

13s. 6f/., and then to 10s., or nearly 50 per cent, from the highest point. This fall

occurred in a period of about nine mouths. In 1848, this same cloth touched the

--very low point of 4s. 6d., its present vakie being 6s. lOd. In 1816 the price of 80-

reed cloth was 29s. a period of depression rather than excitement ; whilst it fell
in 1848 to 4s. Gd. Then, again, a.s another instance of the change in value, and

After this, prices began to advance, until, in 1860, they touched 7s. The causes
which have operated to produce these changes are a reduction in the price of the
raw material, improved machinerv, improved training of the hands emploj'ed, and
the enormous increase of demand, which have enabled the manufactm'er to diminish
the cost per piece on his fixed expenses by tm-ning oii' a gi-eater number of pieces
from the same machinery. Lowness of price, again, has been continually stimu-

lating the demand. He had thus shown the history of the fluctuations in the price

of one article for a period of about half a century, forty-three yeajs of which had
been merely the record of his own pm-chases.

TRAXS ACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  231

On the Relative Pauperism of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1851-1860.
   By Fkedeeick Puedt, F.S.S., Principal of the Statistical Department, Poor

   Law Board.

   This paper treated of the relative pauperism of England, Scotland, and Ireland

during the ten years ended in 1860. It pointed out that each country had its own
Poor Laws, and its separate administrative machinery. Poor Laws had existed in
England for nearly three centuries ; but in Scotland there was nothing worthy of

the°name before 1845 ; and in Ii-elaud they were introduced in 1838. In England

the average number of paupers was 892,671; in Scotland, 120,724; in Ireland,
95,880 ; or 47, 4-0, and 1-5 per cent, on the population, respectively. It was stated
that those who had devoted themselves to study the working of the English Poor
Laws were opposed to the system of " out-door relief," from the difficidty of test-

ing the applicant's claim, aiid from the fear that it may be perverted, in the hands
of^the employers of labour, who constitute the majority of the immediate admini-

strators of relief, to the depression of wages. It appeared that for 1 in-door pauper

in England there were 6 out-door; in Scotland, 13; but in Ireland -03 only.
Thouo-h pauperism is lowest in Ireland, it was shown that in Scotland, where

nearly aU the relief is otd-door, the resident Irish were greatly pauperized, for 1 in
13 was there a pauper ; but in Ireland only 1 in 274. According to the most re-

--cent statistics, there were 43,810 pauper lunatics in the United Kingdom, England

having 33,068, Scotland 5103, and Ireland 5639 of this unfortunate class. On each

10,000 of the population, England has 17, Scotland the same, and Ireland 9 only.

The Commissioners, who in 1858 reported upon the Irish hmatic asylums, stated

that there were 3350 " insane poor at large and unpro\'ided for." This would, if
they were to be included hereafter as paupers, raise the Ii-ish ratio considerably. In
the ten years £92,S85,965 had been raised by poor-rates. In England, £77,960,190
Scotland, £6,182,526; and Ireland, £8,143,249. But of the English portion,
£18,000,000 were for purposes quite imconnected with relief to the poor. The
sums actually spent in relief to the poor were, for England, £54,767,542 ; Scotland,
£5,917,634 ; and Ireland, £6,656,745, respectively equal to a rate per head on the
population of 5«. 9^cl., 3s. ll^d., and 2s. Iff/, annually. The proportion was nearly
triple in England, and doubk in Scotland, that which sufficed for Ireland. Compa-
ring the amount expended in 1860 with that of 1851, it appeared that in England

it was now 10 per cent., and in Scotland 25 per cent, higher. In Ireland, on the
other hand, it was now 60 per cent. loiver. The yearly cost per pauper was, for
England, £6 2s. Sd. ; Scotland, £4 18s. ; and Ireland, £6 18s. \Qd. Ireland stands

hiohest here, because relief in the workhouse is dearest individually, though in its
ultimate effects the most economical and the least demoralizing. The comparison
of the rate in the pound, on the property-tax assessment, was then made in respect
of the seven years ending in 1860, there being no return for Ireland previous to 1854.
The relief to the poor during that period was equal to an annual tax, on the Sche-

Adule assessment, of Is. \d. in England, llld. in Scotland, and lOf f7. in Ireland.

It was considered remarkable that, however diverse the pauperism of the three

--kingdoms had otherwise been, yet, in this relation, there was a considerable ap-

proach to uniformity England only exceeding Scotland by l^d. and Ireland by
2{d. ia the pound. The rate per head of the assessments under Schedides A, B,
and D, on the average population of the seven years, was computed to show the
relative wealth of the three countries : this ia England was £11 17s. ; in Scotland,

£9 13s. ; and in Ireland, £3 5s. Taking these in conjunction with previous ratios,

--it would appear that the pauperism has been inversely as the poverty of the three

countries England, the wealthiest and most pauperized ; Ireland, the poorest and
least pauperized ; Scotland coming between, but much nearer to England, both in

wealth and in pauperism. It was asked, in conclusion, If Ireland, under the judi-

cious administration of her Poor Laws, has reduced her pauperism to a quantity
which, at the present day, is less than oiie per cent, of the population, under what

conditions can we hope that similar results may be achieved for England and Scot-

land ? But it was obsei-ved that something beyond statistical information is re-

quired for the satisfactory solution of this important question.

   Some of the more important data discussed in this paper are briefly exhibited in

the subjoined Tables :

   2nd. To state as compactly as possible the principal features of the ships which
the Admiralty are building and propose to biuld.

   And 3rdly. To bring to the notice of this Association the great increase of dock

accommodation which iron-cased ships have rendered necessary.
   Early in 1859 the Secretary to the Admiralty, the Accountant-General of the

Navy, and the Secretary and Chief Clerk to the Treasiuy, together reported to the
Government of the day (Lord Derby's) that France was building "four iron-sided
ships, of which two were more than half completed," and that these ships were to

take the place of line-of-battle ships for the future. " So convinced do naval men

seem to be in France of the irresistible qualities of these ships," said these gentle-
men, " that they are of opinion that no more ships of the line vnU be laid down."
In another part of their Pieport they said, " The present seems a state of transition,
as regards naval architecture, inducing the French Government to suspe7id the lay-
ing down of new ships of the line altogether." At the instance of Sir John Pakiugton,
then First Lord of the Admiraltj', this Report was immediately presented to Par-
liament, and thus obtained universal publicity.

   From that time forward, then, we have all known perfectly well what the plans
of the French Government in this matter were, and have known equally well that
the only mode of keeping pace even with France in the production of iron-cased
ships was to lay down four of them to match the four which she at that time pos-

sessed, and to build as man}' more annually as she saw fit to add to her navy.
In pm'suance of this \evy simple policy, Sir John Pakington at once had designs of
a formidable class of iron-cased ships prepared, and ordered the construction of one

of these vessels, the 'Warrior.'

   The present Board of Admiralty shortly afterwards succeeded to power, and or-
dered a second of these vessels, the ' Black Prince,' and after some delay also issued

contracts for the ' Defence' and 'Resistance.' No other vessel of the kind was actually
commenced until the present year ; so that in the beginning of 1861 we had only

just attained the position which France held in the beginning of 1859, having ^' four
iron-sided ships, of which two were more than half completed." Meantime France
had been devoting the bulk of her naval expenditm-e for two whole years to the

production of siniUar vessels, and is consequently now in possession of an iron-

cased fleet far more considerable and more forward than ours.
   At length, however, our sluggishness has been overcome, and we have set our-

selves earnestly to work to repair our past deficiencies. The ' Hector' and ' Valiant'
have been laid down, and are being m-ged rapidly forward the ' Achilles,' after a

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

year's preparation, has been fairly commenced; the ' Royal Alfred,' the ' Royal Oak,'
the ' Caledonia,' the ' Ocean,' and the ' Triumph' are in progress ; and contracts havejust

been issued for the construction of three out of six other iron-cased ships, the
building of which has for some time been decided upon. The peculiar features and
propoi-tions of these vessels I shall presently describe but I will first state some of

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the causes which have led to delay in this matter, and set forth the circumstances

imder which we have at last been compelled to advance.

  We have heard much in various quarters about the invention of iron-cased ships,

the credit of which is usually accorded to his Imperial Majesty Napoleon III.,

although there are scores of persons, both here and in America, who claim it for

themselves. But the truth is, very little invention has been displayed in the French

iron-cased ships. Their designers have almost exclusively confined themselves to
the very simple process of reducing a wooden line-of-battle ship to the height of a
frigate, and replacing the weight thus removed by an iron casing 4^ inches thick
placed upon the dwarfed vessel. It was not possible to produce a very efiicient
ship by these meaus ; so they have contented themselves, in most cases, with

vessels like ' La Gloire,' which carry their ports very near to the water when
fully equipped for sea, and are characterized by other imperfections that it would
be easy to point out. The reports of her efficiency which have appeared in the
French newspapers prove nothing in opposition to what I here state. The writers

in those papers have systematically exaggerated the qualities of the French ships

for years past, representing that they could steam at impossible speeds, and carry

as much fuel as any two of om* ships. But these are statements which can be dis-

posed of by scientific calculations of the most elementary kind ; and the imtruth of
the French accounts has been so demonstrated over and over again. With the
                                                                                                                                   ;

fore us yet ; but we have enough to demonstrate her real qualities with sufficient

myaccuracy for  present purpose                                                            and I confidently assert that  she  is  seriously de-
                                                                                        ;

fective as a war-ship in many respects.

   Now, from the very iirst our Admiralty has been averse to the construction of
such vessels as ' La Gloire,' and to the rough and ready solution of the iron-cased-

ship problem which she embodies. Whether their aversion was wise or not, under

the pecidiar circumstances of the case, I shall not presume to say ; but that they

could speedily have produced a fleet of ships in every way equal to 'La Gloire,' had

they pleased, there is not the slightest doubt. Instead of doing this, however, they

have asked, "How do we know whether a plated wooden ship, or a plated iron ship is
·the better? How do we know whether the ])lating should extend from stem to stern,
or not ? How do we know whether the side shoidd be upright or inclined ? or

whether the plating should be backed witli wood or not ? or whether it should form

part of the hidl or not F or whether it should be made of rolled iron or of hammered?

or what its thickness should be ? or how it should be fastened ?" and so forth. And
while all these questions have been asked, we have pretty nearly stood still.

It is only ftiir to Sir John Pakington's Board of Admiralty to say, however,

that, without waiting for answers to them, he ordered, as we have seen, the ' Warrior,'
which is now afloat on the Thames. Those of you who, like myself, proceeded

to Greenhithe in this vessel on the 8th of August, or who have visited her there

since, will doubtless concm- in the praise almost universally accorded to her. In

all the yacht squadrons of the coimti-y there is not a handsomer vessel than the
' Warrior ;' yet there are few iron-cased ships in the French Navy that will bear
comparison with her as a vessel of war. Slie has been so often described in the
public journals, and particidaily in the 'CornhiU Magazine' for February last,
that I need not stay to describe her here.

It is also to the credit of the present Board of Admiralty, that on their accession

to office, they hastened to order the ' Wan-ior's' sister ship, the 'Black Prince,' which

1 doubt not is in every respect her equal. But why they soon afterwards built the

'Defence' and 'Resistance,' ships of 280 feet in length, 54 feet broad, and 3700 tons

burthen, of only 600 horse-power, and plated over less than half their length, I

cannot conceive. I am aware that these -^-essels are primarily designed for coast

--defence, and that their draught of water is more favourable than 'La Gloire's' for

this purpose theirs being 25 feet, and hers 27 feet 6 inches. But with engines

of only 000 horse-power their speed must necessarily be low, and with so small a
portion of their sides coated with thick plates they will be unfitted to stand that
continued " pounding " to which a low-speed coast-defence vessel woidd be more

exposed than a fast sea-going ship. The same objections hold to a certain extent

against the 'Hector' and 'Valiant' class, wliich are of the same length and verv

nearly the same draught of water as the 'Defence' and 'Kesistance;' but their

increased engine-power of 800 horses (which has led to an increased breadth of

2 feet 3 inches, and an increased tonnage of 360 tons) wiU secuie for them a

higher speed, and their thick plating has been continued entirely round the main

deck, so as to protect the gmmers throughout the length of the ship ; and these,

therefore, though defective, are certainly better vessels than the others.

   It is important to obseiTe that, notwithstanding the long delay of the

Admiralty, and despite all we have heard respecting experimental targets, the

in-esistible determination of Parliament to have a large iron-cased fleet has over-

taken the Admiralty before they have obtained answers to any one even of the

questions which we have before mentioned, and upon which they have been so

long deliberating. The cause of this is undoubtedly to be found in the indisposi-

tion of the Admiralty to perfonn experiments upon a sufficiently large scale.

Small targets, a few feet square, have been constnicted and tested in abundance

but the results thus obtained coiTespond to nothing that woidd take place in

practice against a full-size ship afloat. Not a single target of sufficient size, and

of good manufacture, has yet been tested. The Admiralty are at length, however,

having suitable structures prepared : and before long some of om- principal doubts

upon this subject wUl be resolved. Perhaps the slackness of the Boai-d in imder-
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                           235

taMng these colossal experiments will be understood when I say that a committee

of eminent private shipbuilders, including Mr. Scott Russell, Mr. Laird, Mr.

Samuda, and Mr. R. Napier, have estimated that a target large enough to try

half-a-dozen modes of construction would cost no less a sum than £45,000, and

that another £45,000 would have to be expended upon an ii-on hull capable of

floating this target, if the use of such a hull were considered indispensable.

   But, however imprepared the Admiralty may still be, they have been compelled

by the public sentiment, and by the power of Parliament, to make large additions

to oiu- iron-cased fleet during the last few months. When the House of Commons

devotes unmense sums of money to a national object with acclamations, and the

single opponent of the measure acknowledges himself in en'or, the time for ques-

tioning and parleying upon points of detail is passed. And this is what has

happened in this iron-cased ship business. The Government has declared a

number of new ships necessary ; Parliament has voted the requisite funds with

unanimity and cheers                                                                                                      Mr. Lindsay has confessed himself in error ;  and the Board
                                                                                                                       ;

of Admiralty have been instructed to build the ships with all possible despatch. Let

us now see what kind of ships they are to be.

The first of them, the 'Achilles," which has recently been begun in Chatham

Dockyard, so nearly resembles the 'Warrior' and 'Black Prince' that a very few

words will suffice for her. The chief difference between her and those vessels lies,

I believe, in the fact that her beam is slightly broader, and her floor somewhat

flatter, than her predecessors, whereby her tonnage is increased from 6039 to

6089 tons, and her displacement from 8625 to 90.30 tons. All her other dimensions,

--and all her essential featm-es of construction, are exactly lilie those of the 'Wanior,'
   from which it may be inferred that the method of plating the central part only of

the ship, which was introduced by your distinguished Vice-President, Mr. Scott

Russell, is still viewed with favom- by the Admiralty designers. Mr. Scott Rvissell

did not patent this invention, I believe perhaps he will kindly tell us whether he
                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

has found his rejection of the Patent Law to pay him well in this instance.

In the class of ships which come next, however, the Admiralty have consented

to forego the plan of plating amidships only, and purpose plating the ship from

end to end with thick iron. But in order to do this it has been necessary to resort

to larger dimensions than the ' Wamor's ;' and hence these six new ships, three of

which have just been contracted for, are to be 20 feet longer than her, 15 inches

broader, of 582 tons additional biu'den, and 1245 tons additional displacement. As

the displacement is the true measure of the ship's actual size below the water, or of

her weight, it is evident that the new ships are to be considerably more than 1000

tons larger than the 'Warrior' class. As their engines are to be only of the same

power, their speed will probably be less*. This diminished speed is one of the

penalties which have to be paid for protecting the extremities of the ship with

thick plates. Another will probably be a great tendency to plunge and chop in a

sea-way. The construction of such vessels is a series of compromises ; and no one

can fairly blame the Admiralty for building vessels on various plans, so that their

relative merits may be practically tested.

The cost of this new class of ships will exceed that of the 'Warrior ' class by

many thousands of pounds, owing to the increased size. But it will certainly be a

Anoble specimen of a war-ship.                                                                                            vessel built throughout of iron, 400 feet long

and nearly 60 broad, invulnerable from end to end to all shell and to nearly all

shot, armed with an abundance of the most powerful ordnance, with ports 9 feet

6 inches above the water, and steaming at a speed of, say, 13 knots per hour, will

indeed be a formidable engine of war. And, if the present intentions of the

Admiralty are carried out, we shall add six such vessels to our Navy during the

Wenext year or two.                                                                                                       must be prepared, however, to dispense with all beautifying

devices in these ships. Their stems are to be upright, or very nearly so, and

without the forward-reaching " knee of the head " which adds so much to the

beauty of om- present vessels. Their sterns will also be upright, and left as devoid

of adornment as the bows. It should also be stated, as a characteristic feature of

these six new ships, that their thick plating will not extend quite to the head at

the upper part, but will stop at its junction with a transverse plated bulk bow

some little distance from the stem ; and this bulkhead will rise to a sufficient

height to protect the spar deck from being raked by shot.
   It has not yet been decided whether these new iron ships are to have their

plating backed up with teak timber, as in the previous ships ; or whether plating
61 inches in thickness, without a wood backing, is to be applied to them. The de-

termination of this point is to be dependent, I believe, upon the results of th&

forthcoming experiments with the large targets to which I have previously

adverted, and partly upon the recommendations of the Iron Plate Committee to
which our President belongs, and which is presided over by the distinguished

officer now present, Captain Sir John Dalr)'mple Hay, R.N. All that has been

decided is, that whether the armour be of iron alone or of iron and wood combined,
its weight is to be equivalent to that of iron 6i inches thick. The designs of the

ship have been prepared subject to this arrangement, and provision has been made

in the contracts for the adoption of whichever form of armour may be deemed best
when the time comes for applying it.

All the iron-cased ships wbich I have thus far described are built, or to be built,

of iron throughout, except in so far as the timber backing of the plates, the planking

of the decks, and certain internal fittings may be concerned. I now come to notice

a verj' diffijrent class of vessel, in which the hull is to be formed mainlv of timber,

the annour plating being brought upon the ordinary outside planking. The 'Royal

--Alfred,' 'Royal Oak,' 'Caledonia,' 'Ocean' and 'Triumph' are to be of this class. Their

dimensions are to be length 273 feet, breadth 58 feet 5 inches, depth in hold 19

feet 10 inches, mean di-aught of water 25 feet 9 inches, and height of port 7 feet.

They are to be of 4045 tons burthen, and to have a displacement of 6839 tons. They

are to be fitted with engines of 1000 horse-power. They are being framed with

timbers originally designed for wooden line-of-battle ships, but are to be 18 feet

longer than those ships were to be. They will form a class of vessels intermediate

between the 'Hector' and the 'Warrior' classes, but, unlike both of them, will be
plated with armour from end to end. They will be without knees of the head,

and with upright sterns, and will therefore look very nearly as ugly as ' La Gloire,'
although in other respects much superior vessels, being 21 feet 6 inches longer,

3 feet 5 inches broader, and of less draught of water. They wUl also be quite equal

to her in speed.

It will occur to some now present, that in adopting this class of ship we have, after

three years' delay, approximated somewhat to the 'Gloire' model at last. And un-
doubtedly we have done so in the present emergency, in order to compete with the
movements which France is now making. At the same time we have not gone to

work quite so clumsily as our neighbours. Instead of retaining the old line-of-battle

ship proportions, we have gone somewhat beyond them ; and have lifted all the

Wedecks, in order to raise our guns higher above the water.                                       have consequently
--secured a height of port or battery nearly 18 inches greater than 'La Gloire's' an

advantage which wUl prove valuable imder all ordinary circumstances, and incalcul-

ably beneficial in rough weather.

The whole of the new iron-cased ships, including the five plated timber ships

and the six 400- feet iron ships, will, there is every reason to believe, match 'La

Gloire' in speed, supposing the engines put in them to be of the respective powers

--already mentioned a condition which it is necessary to state, since there is, I

regi-et to say, a probabilitj' of smaller engines being placed in some of them. But
not one of all these new ships, the 'Achilles ' only excepted, will have a speed equal
to the 'Warrior's.' Perhaps we ought not to complain if our fleets are as fast as the

French                                but  I, for  one, certainly  do regret  that there  should  be  any falling off  in
                                   ;

this prime quality of our iron-cased vessels. Iron and coal will give us fast vessels

and we have these in abundance. The truly admirable engmes which Messrs.

Penn have placed in the 'Warrior' show that we can command any amount of

engine-power that we require, without incurring risk of any kind ; and it wovdd

indeed oe a blind policy to deprive ourselves of that speed which is pronoxmced

invaluable by every naval officer and man of science who writes or speaks upon

this subject.

I have thus far said nothing cpnceming the armaments of the new classes of
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                         237

vessels wliicli I have been describing, because nothing has yet been finally decided

respecting them. Nor would it be wise to decide this matter in the present state
Weof our artillery, until to do so becomes absolutely necessary.
                                                                  are, it is said,

producing 100-pounder, and even larger, Armstrong guns with great success now,

and may therefore hope for supplies of ordnance of at least that class for these
vessels ; but the modifications and improvements which even Sir William Arm-

strong himself has introduced, since he became our engineer-in-chief for rifled

ordnance, have been so great that we have lost all confidence in the continuance of

existing systems, and hold ourselves prepared daily for fm-ther changes. Before

these new ships are fit to receive their armaments, or even before they have so far

progressed as to make it necessary to fix the positions and dimensions of their
ports, we may be put in possession of a far more eft'ective naval gun than we can

yet manufacture ; and the best gun, wherever it may come from, must unquestion-

ably be adopted for them. Whoever may produce it, we shall have, let us hope,

the great benefit of Sir William Armstrong's splendid mechanical genius, and large

experience, in manufactm-ing it in quantity at Woolwich. This is an advantage

which should not be thought lightly of; for, whatever other views some may en-
tertain, either through jealousy, or rivalry, or conscientious conviction, we must

all agree in believing it a gTeat piece of good fortune to have one of our very ablest

mechanicians placed at the head of this great mechanical department.

I am able, however, to afford some information respecting the number of guns

which the various classes of our new ships wall be able to cany, and probably will

cany. Of the'Defence,"Resistance,"Hector,'and'Valiant'Isha]isaynothing, because

they cannot be considered fit for the line-of-battle, or suitable for any other service

than coast-defence. Nor need I say more of the 'Achilles ' than that she will in all

probability be armed with such ordnance as mav be found to answer best in the

'Warrior' and 'Black Prince.' W^e come, then, to the plated timber ships ; and these
WeI may usefully compare -with the model French vessel.
                                                                  know that 'La

Gloire,' which is 252 feet 6 inches long, has an armament of 34 gims upon her main

deck, and two heavy shell-guns besides-- 36 guns in all. Now our ships are to be

more than 20 feet longer than her, and will therefore talce two additional gvms on

either side ; so that they will cany not less than 40 gims, if the ports are placed as
close together as in 'La Gloire.' "l need claim no gi-eater advantage for them in
respect of their armaments ; but they are manifestly entitled to this. As a matter

of fact, however, they will probably have a much more powerful armament. It is

proposed, I believe, to ami them with about as many guns as 'La Gloire' on the

main deck, all 100-pounder Amistrongs, and 16 or 18 other guns, principally

Armstrongs, on the upper deck, making about 50 guns in all. If this intention be

carried out, thev will manifestly be much more powerful vessels than the original
French ship. The newest and largest vessels, those of 400 feet in length, wiU

each cany at least 40 Armsti-ong lOO-pounders on the main deck, which will be

cased with annoiir, as I before stated, from end to end. In addition to these they

will doubtless have powerful ordnance on their upper decks, for use under favour-

able circumstances. But all these arrangements are, I repeat, liable to change*.

Unfortunately, I am unable to compare the power of these vessels with that of

the largest of the French iron-cased ships, owing to the absence of all detailed in-

formation concerning them. I trust, however, that the Admiralty are in possession

of the necessary particulars, so that the delay which has taken place may be turned

to the best possible account by securing superiority for oiu' fleet. If this be so,

then we shall, after all, profit by the apparent sluggishness of our naval authorities.

In fact, if England had France only to consider, and if the Government of England

were embodied in a single sagacious ruler as absolutely as is that of France, so that we

could ensure prompt action in an emergency, the very best course for us to pursue

in this great naval competition would be "to leave the lead in the hands of the

French Emperor, taking care to add a ship to our Navy for every one added to his,

and to make ours much more powerful than his. In the event of a war, our manu-

facturing resources would be abundantly sufiicient to secure for us a further and

almost instant preponderance. The game which we should thus play would be

both politic and economical. But with other naval nations to compete with, and

with the inertia which inevitably, and often happily, attends a constitutional and

parliamentary system of government, we cannot aiibrd to play games of skill with

omnipotent emperors, but are bound to be ever ready to assert om- preeminence.

    I have a little information concerning the 'Solferino' and her sister French ships

which it may be useful to give you. Her length is 282 feet, breadth 54 feet, mean

draught of water 26 feet, displacement 0820 tons, thickness of armour plating 4f
inches, nominal horse-power of engines 1000. Her plating extends from stem to

stern over the lower gun-deck, and rises up amidships sufficiently high to cover

two decks. She is fiu-nished with an angular projection or prow below the water,

for forcing in the side of an enemy when employed as a ram. I regret my ina-

bility to add materially to these details of the largest French ships.

   Let me now consider briefly the pecuniary phase of this iron-cased ship question.

We may fairly assume that the average cost of such vessels will not be less than

£50 per ton, and that their engines will cost at least £60 per horse-power. Sup-
Eosing these figures to be correct, then the hulls of the eighteen ships which we

 --ave been considering will cost us £4,681,600, and their engines £1,14;3,000 toge-

ther nearly six millions pounds sterling. When masted, rigged, armed, and fully

--equipped for sea, they will of coui-se represent a much larger sum probably nearly

eight millions. These estimates -uall afford some faint conception of the nature of

that "reconstruction " of the Navy upon which we may now be said to have fairly

entered, in so far as the ships themselves are considered.

But I must not conceal the fact that the introduction of these enormous iron-

cased ships has entailed upon us the construction of other colossal and most costly

Weworks.       have now to provide immense docks for their reception ; for we at

present possess none suitable to receive them. Nor must these docks be of large

proportions only ; for in order to sustain ships burdened with thousands of tons of

armour, they must be furnished with more substantial foundations and walls than

any hitherto constructed, and be built of the best materials and with the soundest

and firmest workmanship.

  Many considerations combine to exalt the importance of this part of my subject.

In the first place, the tendency which iron ships have to get foid below water wiU
render it necessary to dock our new ships frequently, under ordinary circumstances,
and whether we go to war or not. In the second place, for aught we yet know,
these ships may be found to give signs of local weakness as soon as they are taken

on an ocean cruise, and to require such repairs and strengthenings as can only be

performed in dock. Again, being steamships, they will be continually liable to

accidents  in  connection  with the engines  or  the  propelling  apparatus                                                and with
                                                                                                                        ;

many such accidents docking will become indispensable. And so I might proceed

to multiply examples of this kind. But there is one consideration which is para-

moimt, and which may therefore be stated at once : we dare not send these ships

against a French fleet unless we have docks for them to run to in the event of a

Wedjsaster.    know not what may happen to these altogether novel structm-es

until they have been exposed to successive broadsides from a heavy naval batteiy

and it would be madness to send them out to encounter a powerful fleet of vessels

aa strong as themselves imless we are prepared to open docks to receive them in

case of necessity.

   I have said that we are at present without dock accommodation for these ships

and it may be desirable to illustrate the correctness of this statement in detail.
What we Vequii-e for them in each case is, first, deep water up to the entrance of

the dock ; secondly, a depth of not less than 27 or 28 feet of water over the sill of

the dock ; and thirdly, a length on the floor of the dock of 400 feet. Now, these

--three conditions are not combined, I believe, in any dock in Great Britain cer-

tainly not in any of Her Majesty's Dockyards. At Portsmouth we have just com-

pleted a pail' of docks which can be thrown into one, 612 feet long. But over the
bar of Portsmouth harboiu- there is a depth of 17 feet only at low water, 27 feet at

high water neaps, and 30 at high water springs. Consequently, these large iron-
cased ships, if they went to Portsmouth in a dangerous state, or in hot haste to get

to sea again, would nevertheless have to wait for the very top of the tide before
they could get eitlier in or out. But even if thei-e were no bar, the Portsmouth dock
would stiU be unavailable in such an emergency ; for the depth of water over the
                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  239

sill of one portion of it is but 25 feet at high-water springs. It is into this dock

that the 'Warrior' is shortly to be taken for the purpose of having her launching

cleats removed, and her bottom cleaned. As she can at present afford to wait upon

the tide without inconvenience, there will be no diiHculty in this case. But in

war time it Would never do to keep such an important member of your squadron

fretting for the tide at Spithead, or to have to lighten her before she could cross

the dock's sill. At Devouport, again, the longest dock is only 299 feet long over
all ; but I am happy to state that one is in progress of construction 437 feet long,
73 broad, and 32 deep at the sill. At Keyham, the longest dock (the South), which

is 356 feet in length, has but 23 feet depth at the sill, while the North, which has
27 feet, is but 308 feet long. At Pembroke, there is a dock of 404 feet, but it

has a sill of 24 feet G inches only. The longest dock at Sheemess is 280 feet ; at

Woolwich, 290; and at Chatham, 387, but the last has but 23 feet 6 inches at the
sill. At Deptford there are but two docks, opening into one, and they are very

shallow. There are a few large private docks in the country which come very near

to oiu' requirements. There is the Canada Dock at Liverpool, for example, 501 feet

long, 100 broad, and with 25 feet 9 inches over the sill. There are also No. 1 Dock

at Southampton, and the Millbay Dock near Plymouth, of M'hich the former is 400

feet long with 25 feet over the sill, and the latter 367 witli 27 feet 6 inches over

sill. But none of these answer all our requirements, nor coidd we avail om-selves

of more than one or two of them in time of war if they did.
   If we turn to the French coast, we shall find that in this matter also we are far

behind om* neighbours. At Cherbourg there are two docks 490 feet long and 80
broad ; two 380 feet by 70 ; two 350 feet by 65 ; and two smaller ones besides. At

Brest, again, there is building a double dock 720 feet by 90 ; and there are also
two 492 feet by 60, and two smaller. At L'Orient there is one 350 feet long, and
another (building) 500 feet. At Toulon there are two in progress, one 406 feet

long, and the other 588, beside several smaller docks which have existed for some

time. I cannot give the depth of the sUls of any of these French docks ; for I have

been unable to obtain that element in any single case even, and I am assured that

no account of it is anywhere recorded in this country. But there is no good reason

to doubt that a proper depth has been given in most instances.

   You will now be able to comprehend the advantage which France has secured

in this matter of dock accommodation for her iron-cased fleets, and will readily dis-

cern the danger to which we should be exposed in the event of an early war with
Athat coimtry.
                single action might so seriously cripple both fleets as to render

large repairs necessary; but France alone would be capable of renewing her strength.

It would be our lot to lie crippled in om' harbours, while she captm-ed our commer-

cial vessels and menaced our coasts.

  I am perfectly well aware that a large increase of dock accommodation is to be

supplied at Chatham forthwith. But our Channel and Mediterranean fleets must
not depend upon docks at Chatham, which cannot be reached from the south until

a long passage has been made, the Nore sands threaded, and an intricate and shal-

low river navigated. W^e must give to om- ships the advantage which Cherbourg

secures for the French, and which they propose to augment by establishing at
Lezardrieux* an immense steam arsenal, protected by an impregnable series of

defences.

   It will now be seen that, in order to place ourselves upon an equality with the

French navy, no less than to meet the certain emergencies which must' arise with
our reconstructed fleets, we oughtwdthout delay to fomid a colossal dock establishment

on some favourable point of om- southern shores, furnished with the means of carry-

ing on extensive repairs in time of war. The most suitable of all positions is pro-
bably that of the Southampton Water, the shore of which, at the entrance to the

river Hamble, presents conditions and circumstances which flnely qualify it for the

purpose. If we are wise enough to build a set of suitable docks there before the
time of war amves, we shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the largest iron-
cased ships now in contemplation will be able to run in and be docked with all
their stores on board, and everything standing. And nothing less than this should

satisfy us.

         The Income-Tax. By the Rev. Canon Eichson.

The author quoted the report of the late Committee of the House of Commons,

in which they declined to interfere with the present mode of levying the tax,

and described the case of a clergyman deriving £150 from a living in a large

parish in Manchester, the extent of which necessitated the employment of

two curates. The clergyman gave up the whole of his income towards the pay-

ment of his assistants, but both he and they were compelled to pay income-tax,

though he did not receive a farthing in the way of personal emolunient. Taking

therefore into consideration the refusal of the report to recommend any modification

of the present Acts for levying and collecting the income-tax ; that the number of
persons who suiier unjustly from the operation of the present Acts is vei-y large

that there are sutficiently definite objections to their operation in whichpersons

concur, without involving those subjects of discussion wherein there is little im-

mediate  prospect of  agreement                                                    that the  operation  of the  present Act  leads  to habi-
                                                                                ;

tual frauds, injm-ious to commercial integrity; and, finally, that the efiforts of indi-

viduals are imequal to the necessary conflict with the prejudices and interests

--arrayed against such a revision of the Acts as then- verj' terms appear to justify', he

considered that, after so unsatisfactory a result of two committees of the House of
Commons as was indicated by the present report, it was useless to expect equitable

improvement, unless they who are dissatisfied with the existing anomalies are pre-

pared, for the present, to sink their differences of opinion in respect to an entire

modification of the bases of the tax, and to form an extensive association, with the

restricted and clearly defined object of promoting the application of the Income-

Tax Acts in harmony with their declared objects.

                   Can Patents he defended on Economical Grounds 1

                         By Professor J. E. T. Sogers, M.A.

   The author contended that patent laws did not stimulate invention ; they did
not come within the definition of protection to propeity and the acknowledged
duty of the state to maintain intact the labour of individuals ; they acted as a
hindrance to improvement by being a check on the freedom of beneficial discoveiy;
they were an illogical acknowledgment that the accidental property of discovery

was the ground for allowing a sole property. AU reasonable advantages were

seciu-ed by secresy, and were constantly superseded bysecresy; and they were a
tax in the fullest sense on the consumer.

                        On the Definition and Incidence of Taxation.

                           By Professor J. E. T. Rogers, 3I.A.

  -- AThe author gave the following definition of a tax : " tax is a contribution

 imposed by an acknowledged authority on a community, for the pui-pose of public

 utility, whether this utility be the discharge of obligations incurred for past ser-

 vices or for the maintenance of present capacities of production, the tax being

. levied on the ground that the utility procm-ed, service rendered, or functions per-

 formed by the administration of this contribution, cannot possiblv be procured,

 rendered, or perfoi-med by individuals, or by inferior cooperative agencies, and can-

--not be so economically discharged by them." The incidence of a tax he indicated

 to be as follows : '' If a tax be levied on sources of income which are of an elastic

-- --character that is, on the services of productive labour, it must be paid by the

 consumer : and though such an incidence may be inexpedient to the community, it
 is not unjust to the person who is the channel of the tax. But if it be levied on
 income which is not elastic, it may be imjust to the person who pays it, as well as
 inexpedient to the person or persons who represent the constmier."

   On some Account of the Manchester Gasworhs. By John SflUTTiEWOETH.

   Manchester was the first place in which the regular and complete application of
gas for economical purposes was successfully tested. This was effected under the
direction of Mr. "William Murdoch, in 1805, at the cotton-miU of Messrs. Phillips
and Lee, and had made Manchester a sort of starting-point in all historical notices
of the subject. Their townsman, Dr. Henry, was the first to direct attention to the
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      241"

purification of gas ; and, farther, the Act 5 George 4, c. 133, wliicli passed in 1824,
under which the Commissioners of Police for Manchester were authorized to esta-

blish gasworks for lighting the town, was, he believed, the first Act ever granted by-

Parliament that empowered a municipal body to apply public funds to the carrying on

of a manufacturing business for the benefit of the public. Until that Act was obtained,

it was an established principle in the legislation of this countiy not to permit public

bodies to become traders. It appeared, then, that in connexion with gas Manchester

enjoyed the distinction of being the locality where its practical use on a large scale

was first shown, of ranking among its citizens the eminent chemist by whose re-

searches its purification was effected, and of removing the Parliamentary restric-

tions that prevented municipal bodies from deriving profits for public use from its

manufacture. The Commissioners of Police, who managed the affairs of the town

under an old Police Act, the 32nd George III., which passed in 1792, began the

public use of gas by fixing a single lamp over the door of the then police office in

Police-street, at the bottom of King-street. He well remembered the crowds that

night after night gathered in front to gaze at it. As the use of gas spread, its supe-

riority to all other light made the public anxious to obtain it for private consump-

tion and several public meetings were held for the pui-pose of urging the Commis-
                        ;

sioners of Police to extend the works so as to supply the general demand. The

--Commissioners made an appeal to the leypayers at large ; and at a meeting held on

the 30th of April, 1817, it was resolved: "That it will be expedient to adopt the

proposed mode of lighting the central parts of the town with gas, and, for the pur-

¥ose of effecting this object, to raise the police rate from 15c?. to 18^. in the pound."

he gasworks were enlarged, a "Gas Committee" was established; but as the

right of the commissioners to sell gas to private consumers was uncertain, it was

thought desirable to obtain a special Act of Parliament to legalize what had been

done and to give power to continue the works, prescribing the application of the

funds derived from them. While the commissioners were preparing their measure,

a notice appeared on the 20th September, 1823, from persons entirely imknown in

Manchester, and without any previous intimation of their intention, to apply to
Parliament for a bill to authorize the establishment of a " Manchester Imperial

Joint-stock Oil Gas Company, to light with oil or other gas the town and parish of

Manchester." On this notice appearing, measures were taken to oppose the pro-

ject, and at the same time to promote the previously intended purpose of obtaining

a Gas Act for the town. In furtherance of these objects meetings were held in

Manchester, Salford, Ardwick, and other townships of the parish. Though the

opposition to th e Oil Gas Bill was thus formidable, the promoters continued their

efforts, and might have succeeded ; but in getting up petitions in favour of the bill
they had resorted to the grossest fraud in attaching forged and fictitious signatures,

and, on these frauds being proved to the committee by the clearest evidence, the com-

mittee to which both bills had been referred at once indignantly rejected the Oil

Gas Bill and adjourned without making any report, alleging that they dispensed

with this customary formality from a motive of mercy to the parties, inasmuch

as they could not make a report without bringing the authors of the fraud and

contempt to justice. So strong and general was the indignation excited in the

House, that on an attempt being made a few days after to revive the committee,

the motion was negatived, not in the usual way by a quiet orderly vote, but, as
it is stated in the newspaper reports of the time, "by a thunder of Noes." The

resentment thus provoked by one party had, perhaps, a reactionary influence in

favour of the other; for the defeat of the Oil Gas Bill was speedily followed by

the passing of the Manchester Act, thereby practically recognizing the principle

that such establishments might be created by public funds and conduc ted by

public bodies for the public benefit, and, further, that the object to which gas-

works especially are subservient are more likely to be secured by a general

establishment conducted under effective public control by a public body than

--by any private association founded solely for private gain in short, that such esta-

blishments are not only legitimate in principle, but are even the best (because the
most certain and convenient) means of effecting those most import ant public im-

provements which progress and circumstances make necessary in towns, which

might not be othei-wise eifected. The Act unfortunately left the constitution of the

body which, under the Act of 1792, governed the town, and from which the gaa

directors had to be chosen, unaltered. The governing body was not composed of a
limited number of persons chosen as representatives, out was constituted of all the
inhabitants who paid a rent of £20 a year. Under such a system it was clear that
whenever there was a strong collision of opinion on public questions, persons on
both sides would qualify in such numbers as utterly to destroy the deliberative
character of the public meetings that might be held. In the proceedings, both with
respect to gas and other public affairs, that took place for years after the passing of
this Act, so great was the excitement that prevailed, that crowds of qualitied inha-
bitants became Commissioners of Police ; and for a long period the meetings that
were held were characterized by the most disgi-acefid turbulence and disorder. At
one meeting alone, in 1827, no less than 665 persons qualified as commissioners.
At these meetings the most extravagant propositions were brought forward, such
as, for instance, that gas should be supplied to consumers at cost price. The par-
ties most prominent and offensive in this violent agitation were chiefly the lowest
class of shopkeepers and publicans. Then followed an agitation for the sale of the
fasworks; but this was eventually suspended by the appointment of the late

  [r. Thomas Wroe to the comptrollership of the works. This was quite an epoch
in the history of the works. In the first year, Mr. Wroe reduced the price 5 per

cent., and raised the production from 88 millions of cubic feet to 96 millions, or
9 per cent., and increased the profits from £10,200 to £13,500, or 34 per cent. In

the ten years that Mr. Wroe was connected with the works he reduced the price
fi'om 10s. 6d. to OS. 9d., and raised the annual profit from £10,200 to £31,700. The
benefit derived by the town from Mr. Wroe's services amounted to an annual sum

of £45,416. This was stated in a report of the Finance Committee, bearing date
August 22, 1842, which he thought ought to be published for general circulation,

as it contained particulars of the services of one who had not yet had justice dona

to his unparalleled work as a public sen^ant.
    For the introduction of the Municipal Corporations Act to Manchester they were

indebted to Mr. Alderman Neild, who originated the movement, and was imtiring
in his exertions until it was accomplished. The Municipal Act, among its many

 other advantages, gave a secm-ity and permanence to the gas establishment which
it could not be considered to possess previously. The consequences had been highly
 important. To the inhabitants it had supplied the best and cheapest light that
 exists. To the public at large it had contributed regularly fmids for widening old
 and forming new streets to an extent that had afforded needfid accommodation for
 the vast increase of traffic, of population, and merchandize that had grown up among
 them, and which, without such aid, would probably have been actually prevented
 by the want of space in the streets and thoroughfares, which was essential to its
 existence. In both social and political economy, facility of communication and
 transit was one of the most important elements of national prosperity, and demanded
 imceasing attention to every available means for securing it. In this respect the
 Manchester gasworks had been especially useful. Before their establishment it
 was the standing and universal reproach of Manchester that it was the worst and
 most inconveniently built town in Europe. It possessed no fund for general im-
 provements, and was so rapidly increasing as to make from day to day the neces-
 sity of such a fund more alarmingly appai'ent. Without the fimds derived from the
 gasworks, the physical necessity of wider and shorter streets would either have put

 a stop to the gi-owth of the traffic, or have rendered absolutely imperative a resort
 to large improvement rates, thus not only most injuriously affecting the value of
 property throughout the town, but also checking and depressing all other interests.

 Sucn were the exigencies of the town in this respect, that at a meeting of the Com-

 missioners of Police in 1827, a scheme of necessaiy improvements to meet the
 rapidly advancing wants of the commimity was brought forward, which involved an

 estimated cost of fi-om one to one and a half million sterling. He thought it was a

 happy circumstance for Manchester in a threatened necessity of such vital import-

 ance to its prosperity, that a fund existed in the profits of the gasworks of sufficient
 magnitude to equal the demand. That these estimates were not overrated was clear
 from the fact that, in addition to improvements still in progress and still wanted,
 the payments from the gas profits for the pm-poses then contemplated have amounted
 to more than £700,000, besides debts incun-ed that were yet owing. In the first
 year of the establishment of the gasworks the profits amoxmted to £263 10s. 5d, In

tlie following seven years they amounted to £20,000, and of this £15,000 to £17,000

was paid towards the erection of the Town Hall. From 1825 to 1839 inclusive

(from the date of the first Gas Act to the grant of the charter, a period of 15 years)

the profit was nearly £172,000, or an average of £11,500 a year; and from 1840,
when he became a member of the Gas Committee, to 1859, when that connexion

ceased, a term of 19 years, they amounted to £660,000, or an average of nearly

£35,000 a year, or treble that of the preceding 15 years. The price to the con-

sumer during the same period had been reduced from about 16s. to 4s. 6d. (in 1859)

per 1000 feet                                                           and but tor a resolution of the Town Council in 1851, by which one-

half of the profits was diverted from improvements to relieve the water rate, would

certainly have been reduced ten years ago to a medium of 4s. per 1000 feet. Ac-

cording to the last published report of the Gas Committee, to June 24, 1860, the

amount of capital in the gasworks was £501,326 gas produced in the year ending

Jime 1860, 779,150,000 cubic feet ; rental, £154,658, which was equal to an average

charge of about 3s. lO^d. per 1000 feet. The price of gas within the city is from

3s. 8d. to 4s., or a medium of 3s. lOd. The cost of cannel, £56,177, equal to Is. 3\d.

per 1000 feet; cannel consumed, 76,039 tons, which showed a production of 10,240

per ton. By the Gas Committee continuing to attend to the quality of the gas so

as to secure the highest purity and illuminating power, and by the council so regu-

lating the price by fixing it at as low as was commensurate with the capital em-

ployed and the business done, they might expect not only a continuance, but an

augmentation of the benefits of which it had been a certain and important source.

On the Altered Condition of the Embroidery Manufacture of Scotland and Ire-
                         land since 1857. Bij John Strang, LL.D.

   The author enlarged upon the advantages of this particular occupation in encou-
raging artistic skill and taste, and in afFording occupation for females at their own

homes. He deplored the capricious fickleness of female fashion, which had led to

a great decline, and said it was to be hoped that so long as the tasteful designer

continued to dream after some new shape or pattern, so long as the unwearied
energy of the manufacturer was exerted to create new articles of utility, and the
restless activity of the merchant was spent on discovering some new market for

their disposal, the futm-e of the muslin embroidery manufacture would ere long be-
come, as heretofore, a pleasing and profitable occupation during the intervals of
field labour and domestic duties to at least as great a number as it formerly did of
the industi-ious females of Scotland and Ireland.

On the Comparative Progress of the English and Scottish Popidation as shown
                hy the Census of 1861. By John Strang, LL.D.

If some distant and untutored foreigner happened to cast his eye over the map

of the world, and were told by some enlightened bystander that within the compa-

ratively small islands of Great Britain and Ireland there resided the elements of a

first-rate political power, he would no doubt feel some little surprise at the intel-

ligence, particularly were he, at the same time, infoi-med that within the boun-

daries of Great Britain itself there was only a surface area of about 57 millions of

statute acres. But the foreigner's sm-prise would be perhaps stiU greater were he

further told that, while the southern portion of the island, called England and Wales,

with a surface of little more than 37 millions of acres, had a population (as ascertained

by the late census, exclusive of the army and navy, and merchant service abroad) of

20,061,725, the northern portion, called Scotland, with a tei-ritorial surface of up-

wards of 20 millions of acres, contained only 3,061,329 inhabitants. Such, how-

ever, are the real                                                      facts of the case                                                                and  those, like ourselves, who are acquainted
                                                                                                                                                      ;

with the distinctive physical peculiarities of the two poi-tions of Great Britain will

feel little wonder about it. There is, however, a subject connected with this ter-

ritorial division of England and Scotland, and their d stinctive populations, which
is not so easily imderstood ; we mean the fact, as shown by the census retxims of

the present century, that there has existed for some considerable time, and parti-

cularly of late years, a marked difference in the ratio of the progress of the popu-

lation within the limits assigned to the northern and southern portions of Great

                                                                                                                                                              16*

Britain respectively. By a table before me, it appears that the population of

England and Wales has, in the course of sixty years, increased to the extent
of 10,905,554, whereas that of Scotland has advanced to the extent of only
1,452,909, exhibiting an increase on the part of England and Wales of 119'1 per
cent., and on that of Scotland of only 90-3 per cent. ; and if we merely compare
the progress of the population of the two divisions of the island respectively during
the last ten years, we find that, while England and Wales show an increase of 12
per cent., Scotland only exhibits an advance of 5'9 (or about 6) per cent. The

question then naturally arises, how can this great and important discrepancy be-

tween the rates of progress in England and Scotland, particidarly as existing between
the years 1851 and 1861, be explained ? Has it been occasioned by a different birth

and death rate ruling in the respective portions of the island ? or is it to be found
in a larger proportional rate of emigration on the part of the North to that of the

South ? Ajid if the latter be the case, what may be the probable causes which

have led to that higher emigration spirit ?
    Let us then attempt to discover what has been the actual natural increase of the

population in Scotland, as deduced from the excess of births over deaths, since 1851.

--And here a difficidty meets us on the threshold the fact that before the 1st of

January, 1855, there was no public register of births, deaths, and marriages kept
in Scotland ; and it is therefore only from the latter period that we can obtain any
authentic figures wherewith to deal. During the last six j-ears and a half, the actufd
increase of the population fi-om the excess of births over deaths amounted to 260,392
and, assuming that the average annual birth and death rates then existing differed but

little from those existing during the three and a half years that preceded the passing

--of the Registration Act for Scotland which rates were, say, birth-rate 3'41 per
--cent., death-rate 2'08 per cent. then it would foUow that during that period of

three and a half years preceding 1st January, 1855, the births must have amounted
to 346,115, and the deaths to 211,120, showing an excess of births over deaths of
134,995, which, when added to the excess of births over deaths during the last
six and a half years, makes a total natural increase of the population in ten years,

 within the boundaries of Scotland, of 395,387, or at the rate of about 13-6 per cent.
 It is therefore quite evident that, had Scotland not been subject to the efiects of a
 serious emigration, her population of last census would have amounted to 3,284,129,

instead of 3,061,251. If such, therefore, may be taken as a proximate pictiu-e of

 the real natural progi-ess of the population of Scotland, it necessarily follows, con-
 sidering the immigration from Ireland into the west of Scotland, that the fide of

 emigrating Scotch to other coimtries must have been very great, especially during
the last ten years, seeing that, in addition to all the Irish immigTation (which, how-
 ever, has not been so large for these four or five years past), there must have gone

 out from Scotland no fewer than 222,878 persons, being the difference between the
natural increase from the excess of births over deaths and the increase as shown
by the late census. According to the returns made to the Registrar General by the

Government Emigi-ation Board, we find that during the last two years the estimated
number of Scotch who have emigTated wath the knowledge of the same board has

 amounted to 183,627, leaving 39,251 which must have left otherwise, either to re-
cruit the anny and navy abroad, to push their fortunes in various parts of the globe,
imaccounted for by the Emigi-ation Commissioners, or, what is more likely, have
gone to swell the population of England.

    That the population of England has been gi-eatly increased from immigration

will at once appear evident when it is stated that in the ten past years the English-
bom emigrants have amounted to 640,210, the natm-al increase of her population
only exhibits 136,460 more than her ascertained population by the census, showing

an unaccounted-for deficiency of 503,740, for which she must have been mainly
indebted to Scotland and Ireland. That an emigi'ating spirit has manifested itself
 on the part of the Scotch more than the English is certain from the fact that, taking

the mean population for the last ten yeai-s of each country, we shall find that, had

Scotland only emigrated proportionally to England, the Scotch emigrants ought

only to have amounted to about 100,010, whereas the nimibers stated by the Com-

missioners are 183,627. If the emigration from Scotland has thus been so dispropor-

tionaUy great, it may be asked from what particular quarter of the coimtiy has this
spirit chiefly manifested itself.^ or, in other words, in what division of the country

has the population absolutely shown a decline ? It appears, from a table, that in

twelve out of the thirty-three counties of Scotland there has been, since the census
of 1851, irrespective altogether of the natural progress of the population by excess
of births over deaths, a diminution of the inhabitants to the extent of 31,825 ; and
as those counties are almost entirely agi'icultural and pastoral, the fact would seem
to indicate that either manual labour was less wanted in these particular districts,
or that a better remuneration for labour and industry was ottered elsewhere. For
a striking contrast to this state of things in the agi'icultural and pastoral parts of

Scotland, we have only to look to the census figures of the commercial, mining, and
manufacturing county of Lanark, where we find, in the course of the last ten years,
an increase to the population of no less than 101,390 ! The fact is, the increase of

the population is almost entirely limited in Scotland to towns, and to these of the

--largest kind the increase iu to-«Tis being 109 per cent., whereas the rural districts

only show an advance of 0-9, or not 1 per cent. ; or, if Scotland be divided into
three gi'eat divisions, viz. insular, mainland-rm-al, and towns, the insular will show
a decrease of 3-6 per cent., the mainland-rural an increase of 3-9 per cent., and the
towns an increase of 12-9. But, to show stiU more forcibly the decline that has
taken place among those residing in the rural portions of Scotland, it may be men-

tioned that the small increase stated as occurring in the mainland-rural district of
3-9 per cent, is owing almost entirely to the increased population of the smaller

towns situated within the limits of that great division of the coimtry. The leading
deduction, then, to be drawn from these dry statistical details is simply this, that
there has existed for some time a manifest tendency on the pai-t of the inhabitants
of the country districts, and particularly of those dwelling amid the highlands and
islands, to quit a land where rural labour was but little wanted, and pastoral care
was poorly paid, for other countries, where both were in good demand and highly
compensated, or for towns and cities, where the hardy and unskilled labourer is

almost always sure to find employment. That this emigrating spirit in search of
future prosperity has proved as yet as advantageous to Scotland as it has certainly
been to Ireland," will scarcely be denied, seeing that it increases not only the value

of the labour, and raises the condition of those who remain behind, but elevates the
position and increases the comforts of those who go away. And although there
must ever be felt a pang on the part of a pilgrim family when abandoning for ever
the cherished scenes of childhood, e^'en when those are associated with nothing
better than the comfortless home of the Highland cottar, still the mutual personal

benefit that results from this separation has been generally found to be, to those

gone and to those left, well worthy of the temporary pang.

   Among the immediate causes which have led to the late depopulation of the

Highlands and islands, and the partial diminution of the inhabitants of the other

rural districts of Scotland, we shall only allude, first, to the great enlargement which

has lately taken place iu the sheep-walks and agricultural farms, particularly in the
northern parts ot the country, thereby diminishing a host of small master graziers,
and even smaller agi-icultural tenants, each and all of them without energy and
without capital ; secondly, to the discouragement given to the continuance of unne-
cessary cottars idly occupying the country ; and thii-dly, to the eifects and results
of the late Highland famines, which have, alas ! too sadly taught the poor and perish-
ing denizens of a country that cannot maintain them to flee for refuge to one more

kind and hospitable. If, however, from the returns of the present census we have

been told that the rural portions of Scotland have, with respect to population, re-
mained either stationaiy or have shown a tendency to decline, it is, at the same

time, certain that, in the great centre of trade, mining, and manufactures (we mean
in Glasgow) there has been a most marvellous increase in the numbers of its inha-
bitants ; for, while at the commencement of the present century that city and its

suburbs only contained 83,769 persons, the last census revealed the fact that its
population, with that of its new-world increasing suburbs, amounted to 446,395,

which, when compared with the population residing on the same territory in

1851, showed an increase of no less than 86,257 during the last ten years, or a rate

of 23'95 (or nearly 24) per cent. That this increase has mainly arisen from a con-
stant immigi'ation from all parts of Scotland, and also from Ireland, is no doubt

certain for if we assume that the last year's birth-and-death rates (which were,
                                          ;

births 3-87 per cent., deaths 3 per cent.) have been the average rates for the last
--246 REPORT 1861.

ten years, which we believe is not fer from the truth, and that the mean population
during the same period may be fairly assumed to have been 403,000, it wiU then

follow that the natural increase, arising from the excess of births over deaths, could
not have amounted to more than about 35,000, which, being deducted from the
ascertained increase as shown by the late census, proves that the increase of the
city and suburbs must have been supplemented by an immigration of upwards of

50,'000.

   That Glasgow, indeed, has been chiefly indebted during the last half century to
the immigration which an increase of capital and an active and multifarious in-
dustry have induced, cannot better be illustrated than from the facts which om*

own lately printed analysis of the enumeration retiutis of the Glasgow census then
exhibited. From these the fact may be gathered that, independent of the many

thousand individuals that have been attracted to that centre of Scottish industry
from all quarters of Scotland, there were found within the limits of its municipality
alone, on the 9th of April last, no less than 10,809 native English, 63,574 native
Irish, 827 foreigners, and 1440 colonists, being about 20 per cent, of the whole of
that population. While Scotland, from its improved and stiU improving system

of agriculture and cattle-rearing, may feel well content to part with her supernu-

merary and unemployed peasantry, either to add to the prosperity of her m'ban seats
of industry, or to continue to fulfil the old adage, that, in every nook of the world
where any good is to be got, there is to be found a Scot, a rat, and a Newcastle
grindstone, she at the same time cannot but feel assured, so long as her soil is daily
becoming more productive, and her manufactures, mining, and commerce are ad-
vancing, and her cities, harbours, and railroads are extending as they are at present
found to be, that she is still on the pathway of prosperity, even although the census
has tnily proclaimed that the progress of her population has only exhibited an in-
crease of scarcely six per cent, during the last ten years of her history.

Notes on the Progress and Prospects of the Trade of England with China since

                       1833. By Colonel Stkes, M.P., F.E.S.

Our present and prospective relations with China, both commercial and political,

are so highly important, and involve such serious consequences, that a few obser-

vations on those subjects may neither be inopportime nor iminteresting. Whether

om* past policy towards China has been justitiable or not, the extension of our com-

mercial relationns with the Chinese is sufficiently remarkable. In the year 1814

the total amount of imports and exports on British account was about 5f millions
sterling. In 1826 the value exceeded seven millions ; and for the last live years

of the East India Company's monopoly the average value of the Company's and

the private trade in which they permitted their servants to engage approached

to ten millions sterling. Since the Act of 1833, which deprived the East India

Company of their monopoly, as might be expected, a nish of competing interests

has increased the trade since 1834 fully fom-fold. In 1856, according to statements

which appeared in different numbers of the Hong Kong Government Gazette, the

value, independently of the opium trade with India, amounted to £17,526,198. In

1857, the imports were £4,783,843 ; but the exports were £12,742,355. So far as

the legal trade was concerned, the exports trebled the imports; but there was an-

other article of commerce of which there was no official record kept. He referred to

opium, which in 1857 amounted to four millions. Still the exports exceeded the

imports by nearly four millions, which must have been paid to China in silver; but

as the balance of trade between India and China had alwavs been in favour of

India, most of the silver from Europe found its way to India through China in pay-

ment for opium, and this fact assisted to account for the silver which poured into

India annually, and did not leave the country again. From the years 1834-36 to

1858-59, India received £123,143,696, in bullion, of which only £19,752,653 left
Athe country again.
                     remarkable progress had taken place in the export trade of

Shanghai-- a fact which presented some anomalous and conflicting considerations.

Since the year 1853 the rebels or Taepings had been in possession of Nankin, the

ancient capital of China, and of several great tea- and siJk-producing provinces in

the Yantsze Kiang ; and Shanghai had to be supplied either from these provinces

«r from provinces heyond the rebel territories and still under the Tartar authorities,

AShanghai. portion of the Eiu^opeans in China had exhausted damnifying epithets

in reference to the rebel character and proceedings. They were "bloodthirsty

brigands,'' &c. He was not an apologist of the rebels ; but he could not refrain

from asking himself how it was that tiie trade of Shanghai could have flourished

in the way it had done if the accusation that they were desolators and extermina-

tors were literally true. Annually increasing quantities of tea and silk could not be

produced from "howling wastes ;" and those products, if for the most part coming

from provinces imder Tai-tar rule, must have passed immolested through Taeping

territories, though as brigands they ought to have plundered them. The Taepings

professed to have a divine mission to extirpate the Tartars, their foreign rulers, and

to destroy idolati-y ; and in prosecuting these objects great atrocities no doubt had

been                                           ;'  but,  in  respect  to  the  rm-al  population  as  contra-distinguished

      pei-petrated

from the Tartars, the fact was patent, that when unexpectedly repulsed in then-

attack upon Shanghai, in August 1860, by French and English troops, although

exasperated by a sense of betrayal, in their retreat they left uninjured the standing

crops around Shanghai, and they did not molest Em-opeans. The natm-e of this

paper will not admit of the discussion of the conflicting opinions promulgated re-

specting the character and conduct equally of the rebels and of the Tartars. There

could be no doubt that they practised towards each other the most revolting atroci-

ties, such as were the usual accompaniments of civil war exasperated by religious

fanaticism. He could only consider the question in relation to the prospects of the

British trade with China. The expenditure of British blood and British treasure

in three successful wars had extorted from the Tartars all the facilities that the

British trader desired to have, leaving, however, in Tartar breasts a burning resent-

ment at the degi-adation of the Imperial government, and in Tartar officials a mani-

fest disposition to obstructive subterfuges in carrying out the treaty of Tien-tsin.

The Taepings or rebels on their part issued proclamations professing amity for

foreigners, calling them " Christian brethren," and inviting them to enter into

conmiercial relations, but with one exception. The traffic in opium they denounce

as a religious ordinance, and threaten the penalty of death to those who engage in
it. The tax-payers of England, therefore, would have to determine whether we

were to tiead in' our former steps, and, for one article of commerce, waste life and

money to force upon a reluctant people, for selfish gain, a deleterious product

while, at the same time, we crushed a national movement to throw off a foreign

oppression, which imder analogous circumstances in Europe had had our warmest

sympathy, and at the success of which all freemen rejoiced.

On some Exceptional Articles of Commerce and Undesirable Sources of Revenue.
                                 By Chaeles Thompson.

   The object of the paper was to show that the malting of barley and distUlation_ of
grain are the means of a great and serious waste of food, enhancing the scarcity
which is so injurious to the welfare of the people ; that the liquor traffic and the
drinking usages it promotes are ban'iers between our wants and an abimdant supply
of food, and that, by passing " the admirable suggestion of the United Kingdom
AUiance, endoised "by Lord Brougham, and hailed by popular acclamation

everj-where," a Penni's.sive Bill to enable a large majority in any district to suppress

the common sale of intoxicating liquors, parliament would legislate on principles
of social justice, soimd political economy, and sagacious statesmanship. The writer,

-- --in conclusion, remarked as follows : "That the food of a people is their life the

means of their existence ; and that whatever tends to render human food scarce in

quantity, or to deteriorate its nutritious quality, or converts it into an element of

mischief and disease, must be anti-social, immoral, irrational, and highly criminal.
Keason, morals, political economy, and social science, all concur in condemnation of
any system that inevitably destroys that which is essential to the life, the health,
and the happiness of the people. " To destroy food is, in effect, to destroy that life
and health and happiness that food sustai ns. Hence, it becomes one of the first
duties of statesmanship to provide and to h usband the means of subsistence. It is

said in a revered book, "He that withhoJc?eth com, the people shall curse him;"

and the instincts of humanity respond to that saying. But if it is wicked and

accursed to "withhold" com in times of scarcity, how much more infamous and

criminal it must be to cause that scarcity, by artificial means, by the deliberate
desti-uction of human food, and by the conversion of it into that which is not food,
but which tends to promote disease, and to degTade the people, in the same pro-
portion that it dissipates the resources of the nation, and perverts and frustrates the
boimtiful and beneficent intentions of Providence ! "

                    Cooperative Stores ; their Bearing on Athenceums, 6fc.

                          Bij the Rev. W. R. Thoebtien, M.A.

  --After some remarks on the principle of cooperation the advantages of the
--scheme, the salutaiy influence it exerts the subject was illustrated by a reference

to the Btirtj P)-ovision Societi/. In March 1858, there were 280 members, capital
£1346, and a dividend of £'157. In March 1861, there were 1550 members, capital
£9420, and a dividend of £1451.

  --The 2}hase of the subject now submitted is educational or literary an appendage

of news-room, reading-room, and library, to these cooperative stores. This is a
neiv and injluential element. The Society referred to opened a news- and reading-
room in October 1859. The source of income to this department is not subscrip-

--tion, but 2h per cent, on the net profits, yielding an average quarterly sum of £27.

This sum is disposed of in these proportions : £10 for the news-room and £17 for

the library.

   The influence which this edncatio7ml element is fitted to exert on athenaeums and
mechanics institutions is great. They are dependent entirely on personal sub-
scriptions. The Bury Atheneeum had, in 18.59, 628 members ; now, in 1861, 431,
the decrease chiefly to be referred to this cause. The tendency of this phase of
cooperation is to weaken or annihilate athenseums, and to bring about one of two
issues, either to throw this department of education into the hands of working men,
or to prompt the middle class to espouse cooperative institutions.

   The Rev. W. Thoebuen also read a paper, in which he deplored the effects of

cooperative societies on Athenffiums and other literary institutions.

On the Employment of Women in Worlhouses. By Miss Ta\'ining.

   The author commenced by saying that in 646 unions and workhouses in England

and Wales there were on the 1st of January 11.3,507 inmates, of whom 30,654 were

children in pauper schools. The whole number of indoor and outdoor poor was

850,896                                        and of those who were called able-bodied 40,000 were males, while above
                                            ;

110,000 were females. Thus a large proportion of our destitute pauper population

was composed of women                          and  children                                         in  many workhouses  they were two-thirds
                                                                                                  ;

of the inmates. The returns of the Poor Law Board gave but scanty information

and with regard to particular workhouises, details were not published. The num-

ber of deaths in the course of the year might be ascertained from the reports of the

local inspectors of health, but they found no details as to the ages and causes of

death. Thus those who paid the rates, and ought to be interested in the mode of
their expenditure, as well as in the welfare of those who were supported by. them,
knew nothing whatever about it. The one nu dical man who visited the workhouse,
and the Guardians, were the only persons who knew anything about the state of

things or the condition of the inmates. With a view of enlightening and interesting

persons in these various large and important institutions, she would suggest that

reports should be annually published, containing accounts of the numbers and classes

of the inmates, the length of time they had been such, 'and, what would be the
most important of all, the causes of death. This would give the information which
now they had not, about the mortality of infants and children in workhouses, about

which much was sunnised, but little was known, from the impossibility of obtain-

ing facts. In short, what she was anxious to urge was the admission of more day-

light generally into workhouses, which would soon result from a more general

interest in them. Subscribers to hospitals and other institutions wished to know
how their money was spent, and what the management was ; and why should not

ratepayers wish to know what was done with the money they contributed ? It

the interest, now partly awakened, might soon become more active and beneficial.

The tide of sympathy and benevolence, which had reached to the very lowest and

apparently to the most hopeless depths of the social system, could not faU to pene-

trate in time the recesses of our workhouses, where thousands of our poorest and

most suftering fellow-creatures were maintained, but about whom so much ignorance

and still more iuditi'erence prevailed. Here was one of the widest fields yet opened

in our coimtiy for the exercise of woman's sympathy and help. Hitherto both had

been practically ignored in these institutions, the management being entirely in

the hands of the guardians, and fi-equently the only responsible woman in authority

being the paid matron, who was expected to control and manage the house and all

the inmates, however numerous they might be. It was now six years since Mrs.

Jameson directed attention to the claims of women to an influence over persons of

their own sex in institutions. Whatever the faults of the inmates of workhouses,

they stood in need of woman's help and s\nnpathy, probably all the more deeply

because women only coidd be the reformers of their own sex ; and if vice had
directly or indirectly brought these women and children to the last refuge of the

destitute, there was the more m'gent call for those of their own sex to come forward

to their rescue. This was the position taken by the Workhouse Visiting Society

three years ago. During the Crimean war, hospital nurses were thought to be bad

enough                                      but the workhouse nurses were almost invariably many grades lower still,
                                         ;

because no remuneration was permitted for them. The most helpless cases faUed

to receive attention except through giving bribes to the nurses, who hovered aroimd

visitors to the patients in the hope of procuring gifts. The condition of the young

was fully as important as that of the sick ; and Miss Twining advocated the desira-

--bility of separating the decent and respectable girls and women from the corrupted

and depraved a point which had never yet been attended to as it deserved. The

experience of nearly six months in the Industrial Home for yoimg women opened

by the Workhouse Visiting Society in London proved that a respectable place was

needed for girls in the intervals of changing their situations. During that period

30 had been received, and fi-om eleven workhouses alone. Of these 20 had been

in pauper schools of some kind, and not having lost their character were not fit ia-

mates of the wards in workhouses where women of all kinds congregated without

distinction. One girl declared that she had never heard such language as greeted

her ears in the ward of a London workhouse, to which she was transfen-ed on

leaving her place ; and another girl, of 16, who proclaimed her intention of leaving

the ward for the worst of pm-poses, said she had gained her infoi-mation from

women in the ward ; and it was well known that the elder women, who were invari-

ably the worst, took a pleasure in coriupting the minds of the younger ones.

Guardians should have the power to pay for girls in institutions where there might

be some hope of their remaining uncorrupted. At present there was no suificient

agency for doing this whilst they were in workhouses. The admission of a higher

and better influence was the only hope of improvement that existed; and why such

an agency should be so frequently rejected was surorising; for it was obvious that

to improve the morality of the inmates was to enable them to lead a respectable

life out of doors, and to get them ofl!" our hands. Yet th'is seemed to be entirely
overlooked by the jealousy of some officials as to " intei-ference,'' so called. She

did not lu'ge an indiscriminate and unauthorized admission of visitors to workhouses.

That had never been the proposal of the Society to which she belonged. That

might have caused confusion and inconvenience, which their plans had never done

Strikes, he said, were amongst the most serious evils to be encountered in the

operations                                  of trade                                          and he noticed the importance of a veiy intimate connexion

between an employer and his workpeople. 1 he pertinacity and endurance of work-

people on strike would do credit to a good cause, and was proof of their capacity

for great improvement. He then passed in review some of the principal strikes that

iave recently taken place, most of which had arisen fii-om dissatisfaction with the
--250 REPORT 1861.

amount of wages paid or proposed to be paid. But strikes very seldom achieved the

object sought ; and it became their duty to inquire if, in the few cases where suc-

cess was possible, that success could be equally secured without resort to this terrible

engine of strife and sutlering. Examples were then given of eight unsuccessful strikes,

which represented the amount of wages lost at £1,082,650, profit lost ±210,602, sub-

AHscriptions £270,617, making a total of £1,563,869.                                                         these strikes have termi-

nated unsuccessfully ; so that there has been no compensation for the loss. If these

sacrifices were necessary, the endurance of the working-classes would command

admiration ; but he could'not admit the justice or desii'ability of a restriction which

prevents a parent and an employer from mutually arranging to bring up a youth to

a good trade ; he could not admit the wisdom of shutting out an eificient workman

because he had not been apprenticed; nor could he see why any society should dic-

tate the price of labour. With regard to the establishment of an arbitration court

for the settlement of disputes, he suggested that it should be honorarj-, that the

parties to the dispute should each name an equal number of jun-nien, that the

County Court judge for the district should be president or umpire^ and that the

Abusiness of the Court should be conducted without lawyers.                                                        bill giving power

to the Lords of the Treasury to arrange such courts on petition would restrict them

within useful limits. Adverting to the establishment of cooperative societies and

manufactm'ing companies with limited liability, he said the prospects they held out

ought to stimidate prudential habits, and so improve the moral tone of working men.

The operations of such societies would also supply a sort of wages barometer, show-

ing what amount it is prudent to pay, because the conductors coidd have but smaU

interest in paying too low a wage, since what is not paid in wages will be in profits,

and the amount of profits declared would, in times of steady trade, also infiuence

wages for the next half-year. If these societies prospered, we might see individual

employers in self-defence constituting their workpeople partners in profits. But

they had still to stand the test of " hard times," and they could not be expected to

pass scatheless through a crisis. He concluded that strikes to restrict the number

of worlanen in a ti-ade ought not to succeed, and that sti-ikes against improved

machinery were attempts to prevent the development of himian intellect and the

progress  of civilization                                                      and  generally he  concluded  that  strikes were wholly in-
                                                                            ;

jm-ious, an entire waste of efibrt, to the extent of not less than a million of pounds

sterling annually, or the bread of 38,460, with 4000 to 5000 additional who would

be required by the profits lost through strikes. Improvements in the constitution

of trade societies would, he thought, prevent many strikes, and woidd secure the

support of employers for these societies ; that cooperative societies, by teaching

pmdence, will be useful aids ; and that an honorary and volvmtary comt of arbitra-

tion would amicably settle such disputes as mightremain.

                      MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

         Address of J. F. Bateman, C.E., F.E.S., President of the Section.
To those who favour us with their attendance for the first time, it may be suificient

to say that the object of the Section is the promotion of mechanical science in a
wide sense ; for to this Section also stands refeiTed all questions of civil engineer-

ing, which, although they may in themselves be only remotely connected with

mechanics, yet depend for their successful issue upon the proper application of
mechanical knowledge. Indeed, it would be difficult to say to wJiat material pur-
suit in life mechanical skill is not of primary importance. In Manchester espe-
cially this Section should be well supported : for in this district have been born
or have resided some of the most distinguished projectors and inventors of the

--age men whose ingenuity and labours have conferred incalculable benefit upon
--the world such men as the Duke of Bridgewater, Sir Richard Arkwright, and

Samuel Crompton, in days not long gone by, and whose places have been well
filled by the inventors and mechanics of our own time. Amongst the questions
which have recently attracted popular attention, and which are specially deserving

of the consideration of the mechanical men of the day, are the improvements
                                                                             --;

which are taking place in the construction of artillery, and in the antagonistic

work of protecting the vessels of our navy from the terrible destruction to which

they are exposed by the superior power and longer range of the guns which can

now be brought to bear against them. It seems, at first sight, almost a matter of

regret that our inventive faculties should be strained to the utmost to produce

the most deadly weapon, ,nnd to ensure the most certain and extensive destruc-

tion of human life ; but there is no axiom more true than that of a late great com-

mander, that " the best security for peace is to be well prepared for wai-." On

the subject of gimnery and ship-armour, we shall be fortimate in having the pre-

sence of many of those who have taken leading parts in their construction or

improvement, and in the experimental and scientific iuAestigations of these im-

portant questions; but I am sure that the Section will join me in the expression

of deep regret that one amongst that number, second to none in mechanical skill,

in successful results, and in indomitable perseverance, no less a man than that

distinguished Manchester citizen, Mr. Whitwoilh, is prevented being here by

serious illness. I trust it is only temporai-y, and that he will yet live man)' years

to enjoy the profits and honours of successful enterprise. In the model-room,

however, will be found one of liis powerfid and beautiful pieces of ordnance, and

an armour-plate, four inches in thickness, pierced by the bolt discharged from his

We12-pounder cannon.  are also to be favoured with some of the plates and other

illustrations of the recent highly-important experiments at Shoeburyness, which,

I trust, will be accompanied by explanations by our President, or b)' other members

of the Association who have taken part in conducting these experiments. The

respective merits of the various inventions which are now exciting attention, and

the various modes of constructing ordnance and ship-armour will thus, I hope, be

brought fairly and fully before the Section. The anxious attention of those most

interested in the management of railways was, during the late very severe winter,

when the theiTnometer fell in some places 10° or 12° below zero, unexpectedly

directed to the sudden and niunerous fractures in the tires of the wheels of the car-

riages and engines. The cause of these fractures, and the best mode of preventing

similar occurrences in severe cold are matters of public importance, and fit sub-

jects for notice and discussion in this Section. But serious as were the dangers

resulting from the intense cold of last winter, they are as nothing to those which

appear to attend the benefit of railway travelling by the excursion trains of the

summer. Within the last few days we have been horrified by the accotmts of two

of the most disasti'ous accidents which have occurred in this country. As to the

cause of one of these we have as yet but vague particulars. The other seems to

have residted from a failm-e in the working of the signals, and from a want of

perfect imderstanding between two signalmen. Another subject which has recently

attracted attention, through the terrible and disastrous conflagration inTooley-street

in London, is the extinction of fire. The powers which now exist for this piu'pose,

with the methods which are adopted, woidd form useful topics for consideration

and such notices as will illustrate the most approved methods of prevention

--whether by the adoption of plans of fireproof construction, or by the judicious

application of water could not fail to be both interesting and instructive. Man-

chester has fortimately been comparatively exempt from calamities of this natm-e
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

and there are peculiarities in the means adopted for their prevention which are

deserving of attention. In those parts of this city in which protection against fire
was most important, the dimensions and arrangements of the pipes were deter-

mined with special reference to these circumstances. In place of the old wood plug,

a simple fire-cock, by which almost instantaneous communication could be made

with the water in the pipe, and to which a hose and jet coidd be attached, was

adopted, and the fire-engines were rather used as carnages or omnibuses for the

conveyance of the firemen and their implements, than for actual use at a fire.
Nearly eveiy block of building in Manchester is commanded by at least a dozen
fire-cocks within 100 yards. The question of the patent laws, and their bearing

on the encouragement or discouragement of mechanical invention, will be promi-

nently brought before the Section, and, I doubt not, very ably discussed by some of

our most eminent men, who have specially considered the effect of protection. It

is proposed to devote, if necessary, the whole of Friday to this important and in-

teresting question. Many other matters of interest and importance wUl, I hope, be
                                                                                       ;

brought before the Section ; and in the discussion that may arise on steam, on the

best form of vessels, on the ventilation of coal mines, navigation, and the other

subjects to which the papers before us promise to di-aw om- attention, I trust we
may all derive instruction and advantage, and find that the bringing together of

people from all parts of the country for friendly discussion, and for the mutual in-

terchange of knowledge, fully carries out the object of the Association for the Ad-

vancement of Science.

       On the Patent Laws. By Sir "W. G. Aeiisteoxg, F.R.S.

Several instances within the author's experience were referred to of the ob-

structive operation of the law which enables an individual, before he has put his

invention into a practical fonn, to obtain a monopoly of the idea and then put a
stop upon all others who are directing their attention to the same subject. The
obstructive tendency of the Patent Laws is aggi'avated by the fact that, in addition

to the patents which are legally valid, there is an enormous nimiber incapable, if

properly opposed, of being enforced at law, but to which people quietly submit in

preference to troublesome and expensive litigation. This is a necessary consequence

of the patents being indiscriminately granted to all applicants without investigation

and it would be diiiicult to remedy this evil by any practical preliminary inquiry.

The number of patents, valid and invalid, is perfectly frightful ; and it is impossible
to make out with any certainty what one is at liberty to invent or use. The author

pointed out the difference between copyright and patent-right : though both ought

to protect the product of a man's mind, copyright neither created impediment

nor injustice, while patent-right did both. It could not be disputed that the Patent

Laws, in restricting the free use of ideas, obstructed invention, if, on the other hand,

they encom'aged it by holding out rewards. Thus the most that could be said was

that they pulled opposite ways ; and this could be no warrant to justify arbitrary
interference with liberty of action. Although the Patent Laws ought to be dis-

cussed solely in reference to public policy, it would be harsh to exclude from con-

sideration the interests of the inventor. He contended that as a ride an inventor

would obtain sufficient reward without giving him exclusive rights. If the mono-

poly were withheld, the inventor got the start of all others ; and the presumption

was, that, understanding his subject better than others, he would keep the lead.

The public have  gi'eat faith in a    name                          and a reputation duly earned is not easily
                                                                 ;

lost. Under any state of the law, hardships of inadequate reward must occur;

and these cases he considered should be met by grants from the State. He in-

stanced the inventor of the screw-propeller, who was unable to obtain any advan-

tage from the law, whilst another person, who conceived the simple idea of enabling

postage-stamps to be easily separated by punching a series of small holes between

them, was placed in a position to obtain an exorbitant recompense from the Govern-

ment.

The author, whilst he admitted that the law was capable of amelioration by havinff

special tribunals for the grant and trial of patent-rights, compulsory licences, and

the abolition of the right to patent foreign mventions, yet he regarded the whole
system as unnecessary and impolitic, and could see no other complete remedy for

its evils than its entire abolition.

Hallway Accidents, from Trains running off the Rails. By 6. Arnott, M.D.

   Inasmuch as the inertia of moving bodies causes them to continue in a rectili-
near direction, and when revolving in a circle this inertia produces what is termed
centrifugal force, the flanges of the outer wheels of a locomotive, in rounding a

curve, are by this force necessarily- brought in contact with the outer elevated line

of rail, the projections of the tires or flanges foi-ming the chief resistance to their

tendency to move oft' at a tangent. When in this relative position, however, should

anv disturbing force exist or arise, particularly one which produces a "jumping " or
rebound of the moving body, such as will elevate the flange to the- level of the
rail, a catastrophe, if the train is going at ordinary speed, becomes inevitable.

   Now, as the safety of the train so materially depends upon the flange, this should
be considerably deepened, and the rails also, where necessary, in a corresponding
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  ^53

degree. If a flange of ordinary depth is occasionally dangerous, one of double the
depth, of proportionate strength, will prove in comparison more than doubly safe;
and in case even of a defective condition of a sleeper or rail, the more powerful

gripe of an enlarged flange wiU most materially lessen the risk of diversion.

         On Elongated Projectiles for Rifled Fire-arms. By T. Astox.

   After alluding to the improvements that have been made in war projectiles,
which have residted in the elongated form, he proceeded to notice the advantages
which it possesses over the old spherical shape. The elongated projectile, present-

ing to the resisting atmosphere a sectional area considerably less than the spherical
of the same weight, is less retarded in its progress through the air. It follows,
therefore, that, although the spherical projectile with a similar charge of gunpowder
is more easily set in motion, and has a gi-eater initial velocity than the elongated

form, and to that extent has at the outset an advantage, the elongated form is much

better able to overcome the resistance of the atmosphere, and, owing to its superiority

of momentum, preserves its progressive power for a much longer period ; at the
same time, it is less disturbed by the varying conditions of the elastic medium
through which it is propelled. In short, it has a longer and truer flight. The
essential condition to the ethciency of the long projectile is, that it shall move

onwards with its point foremost ; if it turns over in its path, it presents a large
surface to the action of the air, its flight at once becomes irregular, and is rapidly

retarded. The action of the common spinning-top suggests at once the idea that
the best mode of making the elongated projectile move steadily through the air
with its point foremost is to give it rotation round its axis of progression. The

rapid revolution of the body causes its inherent inequalities to be rapidly carried
round a constant axis in regular order, and a kind of balance is thereby established,
which gives the body a steady motion. Various plans have been from time to time
tried with the object of imparting to long projectiles a steady flight; they have
been made with spiral grooves cut externally on their periphery, or internally from
front to rear, in the expectation that the resisting action of the atmosphere acting
on the inclined surfaces would give the requisite spinning motion. Again, they
have been made very long and furnished with fins or featliers, in order that they

may be propelled on the principle of the aiTow, but no practicallj' successful results
have as yet brought projectiles of this kind into use. The required object is, as is

well known, readily and successfully effected by propelling the elongated projectile
from a rifled barrel, that is, a tube having its interior made of such a spiral form
that the projectUe while it is propelled from the breech to the muzzle is turned
round its axis of progi-ession : a rotatory motion is thus imparted, which is retained
by the advancing projectile and gives it the required steady motion. The elongated
bullet was first used with rifled small-arms, either poly-grooved or fluted, or, like
the Enfield, having three grooves. The length, however, was limited and various

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

attempts were made to fire longer projectiles compounded of various metals and of
various shapes, so that by changing the position of the centre of gravity they might
be propelled point foremost. But, if made beyond a certain length, they were
always found to turn over at moderately long ranges. Mr. Whitworth was the

first to enunciate the principle that projectiles of any requisite length coidd be
successfully fixed by giving them rapid velocity of rotation, which should be in-
creased in proportion with their increased length. He, as is well known, uses rifles

having a spiral polygonal bore, in which all the interior surfaces are made effective
as rifling surfaces. The success of the elongated projectile having been established

in the case of small-arms, their emplojTnent with ordnance followed as a natural
consequence. Rifled ordnance were, therefore, called into existence to meet the

requirements of the time. In fact, the rifled cannon may be considered as a rifled
musket made with enlarged proportions. Directing our attention more particularly
to the two systems of Armstrong and Whitworth, we see in the fonner the coiled

barrel and fluted bore fonnerly used for the rifled small-ami, applied on an en-
larged scale. In the "^Hiitworth cannon the same system and form of rifling are
used which are employed for the Whitworth musket. There is, however, a change
required for the projectiles ; they cannot, like the small-arms bullets, be made of
lead, for obvious reasons, such as the cost of the metal, its liability to distortion of
                    :

--254 REPORT 1861.

form, and unsuitableness for shells. Sir William Armstrong uses a compound

--projectile, formed of an iron case surrounded with a leaden coating the rifling

being eftected by the force of the explosion in the barrel, which is thus partly ex-
pended in forcing the lead through the grooves. Mr. Whitworth uses a simple
hard-metal projectile, made of the requisite shape to fit the rifled bore by machine
labour in the manufactory ; so that the whole force of the explosion is employed to
propel the projectile. After gi'ving a description of the two projectiles, and point-
ing out that the Annstrong projectile necessarily required a breech-loading cannon,
and that the Whitworth is used at pleasure for muzzle-loading or breech-loading
cannon, Mr. Aston proceeded to notice the external shape of the projectiles. The
importance of giving to ships intended for high speed the shape best suited to

facilitate their progress though water is now universally acknowledged ; and Mr.
Whitworth considered that it was necessary to ascertain, by reasoning upon similar
grounds, and by experimental research, what was the proper shape to give to his

projectile, so that it might be propelled through the air under conditions most
favourable to precision and range. He, after numerous corroborating experiments,
decided that the projectile of the form exhibited to the Meeting was the best. It
has a taper front, having nearly the external section of what mathematicians term
the solid of least resistance, the curve being somewhat rounded ; the rear is made

to taper in such proportion that the air displaced by the front is allowed readily
to close in behind upon the inclined surfaces of the rear part. The middle part is

left parallel to the required distance, to provide rifling surfaces and obviate windage.

The results of long and repeated trials show that this form of projectile gives much

greater precision and a superiority of range, varying from 15 to 25 and 30 per cent,
(according to the elevation and consequent length of range), as compared with a

projectile of the common rounded front and parallel rear end. At low elevations,

where the range is comparatively short and the velocities great, the difference in
the result of the taper and non-taper rear is not so marked as at the higher eleva-
tions, where the mean velocities of the projectiles are reduced. But at all ranges
the superiority exists both in precision and velocity, as the elongated projectile at
no practical range has a mean velocity so great as to prevent the atmosphere
closmg in behind it. One of the most important advantages attending the use of
the taper rear is, that it gives a lower trajectoiy, which renders errors in judging
distance of minor importance, as the projectile which skims along near to the
ground is more likely to hit a mark, especially a moving one, than a projectile
which, moving in a more curved path, has to drop, as it were, upon the object
aimed at, whose distance therefore must be accurately guessed. The taper shape
of the rear is pecidiarly well adapted for the proper lubrication of the gun, which
is most essential for good shooting. W^ith the Whitworth gun a wad made wholly
of lubricating material was introduced; it obviates the necessity of washing out

--the piece, and the subsequent adoption of a similar wad for the Armstrong gun

enabled that piece also to be used ^uthout washing out, which was at first necessaiy

and foimd to oe a very inconvenient operation for a service gun. Various forms
of elongated Whitworth projectiles suited for special pui-poses were described
tubidar projectiles for cutting cores out of soft materials, as the sides of timber
ships ; flat-fronted hardened projectiles, first used by Whitworth and afterwards by

Armstrong, for penetrating iron plates. It is found that these projectiles penetrate,

when fired point blank, through iron plates inclined at an angle of 57^° to the
perpendicular. The edge of the flat front, though slightly rounded, takes a hold,
as it were, as soon as it touches the plate, and the resistance met is merely that due
to the thickness of plate measured diagonally. Official experimental trials made
on board the ' Excellent,' at Portsmouth showed that these projectiles penetrate
readily through water, and would go through a ship's side below water-mark.
The new American floating battery, which is submerged to protect her sides during

action, would find no defence in that plan against these projectiles. Shell and
shrapnel hav-ing the elongated form and taper rear were also described ; and to
show the suitableness of that form for ricochet firing, tables were read, from which

it appears that the mean results of a series of six shots, making many ricochets
within a range of 2400 yards, gave the greatest mean deviation of about 75 j-ards
from the straight line. In considering the probable result of the contest now going
on between armour-plates and projectiles, it should be borne in mind that the limit
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  255

of thickness of armour-plate that can be carried by ship^ wUl soon be reached, but
that the power of destruction of projectiles may bs without doubt increased far
beyond what has hitherto been tried. It may therefore be reasonably anticipated
that in this all-important contest the victory will ultimately rest on the side of the

projectile.

               On Street-Pipe Arrangements for Extingidshing Fires.
                By J. F. Bateman, F.B.S., President of the Section.
  He had hoped that a paper would have been read on this subject by Mr. Rose, of

the Manchester Fire Bi'igaile ; but as that gentleman had been called away by the
illness of a relative, he thought it right that the proceedings of the Section should
not terminate without some observations being made on the subject. Nothing
could have been much worse than the arrangements made for the extinction of fires
some fifteen years ago, nor than the state of things which existed at the present
day in the City of London. In most large towns, as Manchester and Glasgow, for
instance, where the supply of water had been taken into the hands of the Corpo-
ration, the best preparations had been made for the extinction of fires. But in
London the fire-engines and the fire brigade were maintained by contributions

from the difierent insurance companies ; and therefore it was evident that their

interest only lay in preventing the destruction of property that was insured. It
was clear this was a state of things which ought not to exist in this country.
Some twelve or fifteen years ago he turned his attention to the subject of the ex-
tinction of fires. The old wooden plug was then generally in use, and it still con-
tinued in use in some parts of the country. Mr. Bateman described the construc-

tion of the fire-cock and stand-pipe, with which he had replaced the old plugs in
Manchester and other towns, and stated that, as a general rule, these fire-cocks had

been found sufficient without the use of fire-engines. He also explained the prin-
ciple upon which the water-pipes were laid down in Manchester ; so that within

reach of nearly every block of valuable buildings in Manchester and the neighbour-
hood, there were from two to three sources of water-supply from different water-
mains, and ten or twelve fire-cocks within a himdred yards. Then came the ques-
tion of pressure. About eighty or ninety feet was the gi-eatest height water could
be thrown by a fire-engine. The highest mills in Manchester were from forty feet

to sixty feet ; and experiments had been made which showed that water could be
thrown without the aid of fire-engines from thirty-three to ninety feet in height,
according to the pressure in the pipes, dm-ing the day, and when the service of the
town was fully going on.

  On the Applicatioiis of the Hydraulic Press. By Edavaeb T. Bellhouse.

  He traced its origin to Joseph Bramah, in 1785, and explained its present con-

struction by means of diagrams, and then adverted to the various piu-poses to which
it has been and is applied. These included the raising of the Britannia tubes, the

launching of the ' Great Eastern,' the raising of ships on slips, the packing into
bales of Manchester goods, cotton, wool, and hay, the extraction of oil from linseed,
rapeseed, and hempseed, the manufacture of lead pipes, the testing the strength of

materials, &c. The application of the steam-engine for working the pumps was
alluded to, as now becoming general. He more particularly dwelt upon the various

kinds of hydraulic presses used for packing cotton in India. He also described a

stop and let-off cock, worked by a hand lever, which was very convenient of appli-
cation. In the cotton-press, the pressure put upon the pumps was sometimes as

great as six tons per square inch. He hoped some lighter and stronger metal would

be found for the cylinders, rams, &c. than the cast iron at present used.

                On Artillery versus Armour. By Captain Biaeelt.

 _ The author said it was now four years since he first laid before the British Asso-

ciation at Dublin his ideas with reference to the strength and extent of range which
might be obtained with cannon built up of concentric tubes of metal, so adjusted
that all should share in resisting the bursting eflbrt of the charge of gunpowder.
The size of cannon before the discovery of this method was limited by the certainty

--256 REPORT 1861.

  that any smootli-bored gun abore the 68-pouiider, and any rifled gun of even half
  that size must burst after very few rounds with full charge of powder. Now, Cap-
  tain Blakely maintained, there was no difficulty in making guns ten times more

 powerful. He believed that not onlj^ a 600-poimder, but even a 6000-poxmder

  could be constructed, if great care were taken in selecting the best materials, and
  in putting on the outer layers with the exact degi-ee of tension required to enable
  them to exert their strength. If the outer layers (he used them generally in the

  form of lings) were too tight, they burst before tlie central part ; and if they were

  too loose, the central parts burst iirst, and perhaps left the rings whole. Exten-
 sive experiments had been made to determine the proper degree of tension for these

 rings, because on that point depended the efficiency of the gun. Not only had he
 (CaptainBlakely) made such experiments, but also the Spanish andEnglish Govern-

--ments, the latter having made several hundred fall-sized cannon, some of which
--were built up entirely of iron, the tension of the outer portion being varied some

 being constructed partly of iron, partly of brass. It was well worth the trouble of

 any person desirous of studying the question to \-isit "Woolwich Arsenal and see

 the broken fragments of these cannon. Captain Blakely believed the truth might
 have been arrived at with less expense ; however, the result was the acknowledg-
 ment by the Select Ordnance Committee of the exactness of Captain Blakeh^'s
 views in reference to cannon, viz. that all large guns must be built up, that the
 outer parts must be in a state of initial tension, and that so definite, that the
.slightest excess or deficiency of tension detracts from the strength of the gun.

All guns now made in the English Arsenals are constructed on those principles

 though afterwards spoilt, in his opinion, by the weakening of the breech for the

pm-pose of loading by that end. Spanish guns also are now built up. Captain
Blakely exhibited the drawing of the new Spanish naval gun, and explained its
construction. The diameter of the bore was between six and seven inches ; more
than half of the gun, he said, was of cast iron, the upper portion of the breech only

being formed of rings of steel.
    Captain Blakely regi'etted that the English Government did not obtain all the

advantages fi'om the system which he thought it capable of aflbrding. They re-

--fused to make any cannon larger than 120-pounders perhaps because Sir William

Amistrong's breech-loading apparatus was not adapted for large guns ; and they also
refused his (Captain Blakely's) ofler to make at his own expense a 600-pounder,

and lend it to them for experiment against their model t.argets. He would not say

anything of the policy of this conduct, but he believed he was in order in saying
that it was not "philosophical" to refuse to try a larger gim, and at the same time
to proclaim that the plates, constmcted to resist little lOO-pound pop-guns, were
"impeneti-able."' Eor his part he firmly believed that he could make cannon either
to punch holes through not only 4:-inch but 8-inch plates, or, what was better
still, to crush them completely.

                      On Recent Improvements in Cotton-Gins.

By Dattd Chadwick, F.S.S., of the Manchester Committee.

A description was given of the old Indian chm-ka, one of which was exhibited

to the Meeting ; and the invention of the American saw gin, by Eli AVhitney, was

also noticed and described. On the recent visit to England of Dr. Forbes, the

superintendent of the cotton-gin factory of the late East India Company, to Darwhar,

he introduced an improved cotton-gin, based upon the principle of the Indian churka.

This chm-ka gin had subsequently been improved by ^Ir. John Dunlop, of Man-

chester, and Messrs.  Piatt Brothers, of  Oldham                                   and the improved machines were
                                                                                ;

exhibited to the Meeting. The improvements in Messrs. Piatt's machines con-

sisted in the application of spike rollers revolving at different speeds in connexion

with vibrating machinery, which ti'ansmits the cotton to the ordinary churka rol-

lers. The effect of this "is to enable the machine to be supplied with cotton con-

tinuously instead of at intenals with the fingers. The machine is intended to be

worked by power, and requires the attendance only of a child thirteen years of age.

Mr. Dunlop's machine was less expensive, but more compact, and bearing a closer

resemblance to the original chm-ka, and was intended to be worked by hand.

A Proposal for a Class of Gunboats mpahle of enrfaijhif/ Armour-plated Ships

   at Sea, accompanied with Suggestions for fastenimj on Armour-Plates. By

    Dr. Ebdy.

The author thought that the monster iron-clad vessels which we and our neigh-

bours were building might be successfully assailed by vessels of very inferior size

specially designed for the purpose. The first essential condition for such vessels

was superiority of speed, with such protection as to approach the enemy without

being crippled. He believed that one such vessel with a couple of heavy guns

might so harass a larger vessel as to paralyze her movements, and that two such

vessels might even engage -with advantage ; and, if this was so, might not a flotilla

of these smaU vessels advantageously engage a fleet of the large iron-plated ships ?
To obtain superior speed, we must either sacrifice weight of metal or increase the

size. He preferred the former, and by reducing the armament to a very few guna
(two or four), and those of the powerful kind now manuftictured, he thought we

might obtain the required speed within moderate dimensions ; and he hoped to

show that, by a peculiar adjustment of material, we might gain all the protection
required, without immoderate weight. Much of this problem had indeed been

worked out by Capt. Coles, of whose cupola, the conical fort, with revolving

Ashield, in the moclel produced, was a modification.  speed of sixteen knots

an hour woidd, he believed, be sufficient for present piu-poses, and he took it that

this speed might be secured without difficidty in a vessel of fine lines, and of cer-

tain proportions, without tremendous size. Dr. Eddy proceeded to describe from

a model the kind of gimboat he proposed to build. The dimensions, he said, were

calculated from one datum, namely, the least elevation above water at which the

guns coidd advantageously be laid, which he took to be 8 feet. In this position,

then, he woidd place two of the heaviest Annstrong guns, with their muzzles 41
feet apart, on an inclined slide, upon a tiu'n-table pbced within a fixed conical

fort, armour-clad, the sides of which sloped at an angle of 45°. Above this, for a

perpendicidar height of 4 feet, he would protect the guns and gunners with a

shield of iron plate, also at an angle of 45°. The shape of the fort would be a

Atruncated cone on a cylinder, like an extinguisher upon a candlestick.  second

cupola he believed might be added, and this woidd give an armament of foiu" guns,

which, if concentrated upon one point at short range, must have a crushing eflect.

But, to be of any use, the smaller vessel must be enabled to approach her large

antagonist without risk of having a shot sent through her bottom from the enemy's

depressed guns. The manner in which he proposed to fortify the gunboat was by

keeping all the vital parts well below the water-line, and covering them -with a

deck which would deflect upwards any shot that might reach it. As the boat was

only intended to attack ships, not forts, he presumed there was no need to appre-

hend a shot striking her at a larger angle with the horizon than 7°. Still at this

angle, to protect the sides of the vessel eftectually, the armom* must be carried at

least 4 feet above water and 3 feet below, possibly more ; but as this involved

a weight of 300 tons in plating alone, some other method of protection must be

sought. He hoped he had found this desideratum in a plan which aimed at

carrying out thoroughly the principle of deflection. His plan consisted of an arched

deck of inch iron resting upon two courses of timber, the extremities of the arch

being tied, so as to neutralize the outward thrust. He proposed that this shoidd

spring at the sides from 3 feet below the water-line, and that the crown shovdd rise

--amidships up to the water-line, the crown being kept tolerably flat the object being

to present so small an angle that even a flat-headed bolt shoidd glance off". The

space above the deck and between it and the water-line he proposed to pack with

some tough and resilient but light fibre, and these qualities he found combined in

the cocoa-nut fibre, which could be easily rendered incombustible by sal-ammoniac.

This fibre would offer a considerable amount of resistance to the penetration of a

shot, and in proportion to the resistance woidd tend to deflect the shot. The exact
amount of resistance which this mode of packing would afford could not be ascer-

tained without experiment, but the trial woidd not be expensive. He might be met

with the objection, that steel or iron was the substance which ofl'ered the gi-eatest

amoimt of protection proportionate to its weight. Granting this, he maintained

that there were circumstances under which iron alone coidd not be advantageously

used and that this was one. Dr. Eddy aUuded to the difficulty now felt in
securing the iron plates on the sides of the vessels without weakening them by

perforating holes ; and he mentioned a plan of screwing the plates within a rail-
shaped frame, which he said he had been encouraged by Mr. Faii-baim to lay before
the Section, and which he thought would obviate the difficulty.

        On a Brick-making Machine. By Petek Efkeetz.

On a Perambulator and Street Railway. By Jokn" Hawoeth.

   The author proposed a central rail, having in_ it a groove for a small guiding

wheel, similar to tnat of a perambulator. By this simple contrivance, an omnibus

coidd be kept upon the two outer and level rails without the necessity of flanges

to the wheels. The plan was cheap beyond comparison, costing only £1000 per

Amile.  length of route had been laid down in Salford for some months, and had

oiven great satisfaction ; it had been ridden upon by many persons, engineers and

others, who foimd it to be practicable and agreeable. It required 35 per cent, less

power to draw an omnibus over metal rails than the ordinary roads, and it was esti-

mated that there would be a saving ia the wear and tear of vehicles of 75 per cent.

He believed it would be to the interest of trustees of roads to lay down such a

railway, as it would save the great desti-uction of the roads ; and coach proprietors

would be glad of the opportunity to pay a mileage toll for the saving of horses and

rolling stock which they would realize by the change.

--On the Rise and Progress of Clipper and Steam Navigation on the Coasts and
  Rivers of Chiim and India. Section 1. By Andrew Henbeeson, A.I. C.E.,

   F.R.G.S.

   1. The importance of this subject Is too great to need any comment In bringing
it before the British Association. It is owing to the supeiiority of her navigation
that England is chiefly indebted for her supremacy amongst other nations ; and it
is by that means alone she can hope to maintain her dominion. Any subject, there-
fore, that bears at aU on the question of navigation Is of too gi-eat moment to be
passed over without the fullest consideration of its value and applicability.

   2. The author's system of steam commimication is more immediately connected
with India and China, as It is in those countries that he has spent many years, the
nangation of which he Is Intimately connected with, and to Its iruprovement he
has devoted the best energies of his life. The na-vigation of the Eastern rivers,
coasts, and archipelagos Is perhaps the most diflicult and dangerous nautical service

in the world. Any plan, therefore, which will successfully overcome those diffi-

culties must be considered as one of imlversal application.
    3. The vast interest at stake in those coimtrles Is too great for any plan to be

neglected which would tend to preserve them to us, and the recent Indian mutiny
shows the urgent necessity for maintaining a perfect communication throughout
the coasts and rivers of British India, extending, aa It does, fi'om Kui-rachee to

Singapore.

    4. The river system, at present navigable from Peshawaur to Sudij-a, on the
 Indus and Burhampootra, would, if navigated on its upper affluents by light-di-aught
boats, bring European civilization and science In communication with 250,000,000

 of the population of India.

    5. The recent opening of the ports, rivers, canals, and lakes of China gives a
 larger field for entei-prlse In that coimtry than was ever before anticipated. Having
 visited China since 1817, the author has always held the opinion that China

 has, for ages, established the best system of river navigation in the world, both In
 the construction of boats to meet the requirements of tarade, and in her canal

 work, to which may be attributed her early civilization and the means of support-

 ing a dense population of 360 millions.

    G. He piu'posed, therefore, giving a brief review of the principal systems which
                                                 "

have been established on the Bengal and Scinde rivers, with the results attained by

each, together with his proposal lor a better S3'stem than has yet been adopted, and

its extension to India and China. His plans, modifications, and improvements are

applicable to all the vessels in use, and consist of an embodiment of the best

features of each type derived from thirty years' practical experience and close

obsei-vation of the navigation of the coasts and rivers of India and China, and

other parts of the world. ·  .                      ,

7. The papers presented by the author on this occasion were the result of consider-

able labour, and were in continuation of foimer reports made to the Association, viz.

"Report on the statistics of life-boats and iishing-boats," published in the Asso-
ciation's Report, vol. 1857 ; also as a member and contributor to the " Report of a
Committee, consisting of the Right Hon. Earl of Hardwicke, chairman, Mr. John

Scott Russell, Mr. James Robert Napier, JNli-. Charles Atherton, Rev. Dr. WooUey,

Admiral Moorsom, Professor Bennett Woodcroft, and others, ' appointed to inquire

into the defects of the present methods of measuring and registering the? tonnage

of shipping, as also of marine-engine power, and to frame more perfect rides in order

that a correct and unifonn principle may be adopted to estimate the actual caiTying

capabilities and working power of steam-ships.'

8. Early in 1858 the author brought before the Indian government a review of

steam navigation in the Bengal rivers, together with a plan to construct a fleet of

steam tug- and tow-boats, to meet the military requirements of government, and

form the nucleus of a system of water-transport service on the Ganges, Biu'ham-

pootra, and Irrawaddy. Subsequently he submitted a plan of a Military Nautilus

Flotilla of one tug- and three tow-boats, 100 feet long, with engines of 40 horse-

power in tug, and auxiliary power in each tow, built at an estimate cost of £6000

--to £8000 ; for the smaller boats, 75 feet long and 50 tons, with engines of 20-horse

power, £5000 to £6500. At the close of the session of Parliament he proposed to

an eminent engineer that, if he would provide the engine, he (the author) would

--build the hull and fittings of a military- nautilus a proposition which was declined.

   9. In 1858 the subject was brought before the British Association, and is printed

in the Reports of 1858, entitled, " On river steamers, their form, construction, and

fittings, with reference to the necessity for improving the present means of shallow-

water navigation on the rivers of British India." Copies of the report have been

--circulated among the members previous to the discussion of the several subjects

contained in the two papers that on the system of tug- and tow-boats comprising

a record of the experiments I have made with the smallest Nautilus flotilla during

the last two years, including the resistance as measiu-ed by dynamometer.
   10. At theMechanics'Institution, Da-s-id Street, the Nautilus Flotilla System

was exemplified by models, on half-inch scale, of the smallest class of Nautilus

flotilla, of one tug- and two tow-boats, 85 feet long each, and 50 sailing and cargo
boats, built for the East Indian Railway Companj', on the author's lines, and 'Assam'

type, as iron oulacs and bhurs of the Bengal rivers ; half, or twenty-five iron oulacs,

being built on his specification, and mercantile system of contracting, with details of

Chinese rig, fitting, and sculls, with his patent balanced mdders in bow and stern.

   11. Also, on a quarter-inch scale, the models of a first-class Nautilus flotilla, of

one steam-tug and two aiLxiliary tow-vessels, each 200 feet long, on the author's
lines, of the 'Assam ' type, but on the routine or lump-sum system of contracting, for

--the East Indian Railway Company ; their consulting engineer furnishing the spe-

cification and consti'uction that of the contractors being deficient in sti-ength and

propoi-tion. Six of these vessels and three steam-tiigs of 170 horse-power have been

built with his patent balanced rudder, bow and stem.

   12. These vessels are all built on the type of the ' Assam,' with engines of 100
horse-power by Fawcett and Co., of Liveipool, a model of which was exhibited to

the Association, showing the bow and stem rudder as originally fitted, and used
for one year on the Burhampootra, when she was transferred to the Ganges, and,

from the' prejudice of commanders, fitted vdth the Ganges rudder, where, without

alteration in the engines, rovers, or vessel, after twenty years' service, she is now

(1861) being lengthened.

Committee on Shipping Statistics, presented to the British Association, September

into the statistics of shipping, with a view to rendering statistical record more
available as data conducive to the improvement of naval architecture as respects

the adaptation of the form of ships to the requirements of sea-service."
   14. Mr. Atherton has already made a report showing that, by a little variation in

the shape of the ship, as great a difference may be made in the freight of goods car-

ried by her (that is, her actual mercantile value) as there is between 100 and 102.

1.5. In continuation of the report on shipping; statistics, the author has devoted

his attention to reducing the amount of capital required, by the adoption of a mer-

cantile system of contracting, and the establishment of a system of test-trials

through tabular forms, and a register of particulars of all vessels.

   16. The author presented a tabular register for all the river steamers in the In-
dian Government, and private, railway and guaranteed companies in India. The
particidars for register are obtained from three tabular forms of record, return, and

report of trials. There is an abstract of correspondence with the East Indian Go-

vernment, in reference to the establishing improved steam tug- and tow-boats of

the ' Assam ' type on the rivers of India and China, in the left column.
> 17. In the right-hand column is an abstract of correspondence vn*h. Sir James
Melville, K.C.E., official director of Indian railways (guaranteed), with a me-
morandum on the test-trials of steamers, proposing to adopt a imifonn mode of

recording the dimensions, calcidated quantities of displacement, and capability for

cargo. There .are also rules for testing the strength and capability.

  AnUS. instance is given of the trial of barges that proved deficient in strength,

and of a trial steamer and tow-barge of another contractor that averaged 11 j miles

an hour, carrying 600 tons of cargo, and a 4ft. draught, for a three hours' run, half

of which time was with a throttle-valve fidl open, to test the efficiency of the boiler

to maintain the steam at the conti-act pressure.

 -- A19. The tabular forms presented were as follows : Record of steamers, form

Construction ; form of tender or certificate of dimensions and calculated quantities

of displacement ;  area  of mid-section ;  weight of hull,  engines,  and stores                                                 showing
                                                                                                                              ;

rimental trips and performances at sea, and consumption of coal.

21. Report, form C : The same particulars on test-trials, with diagrams to indi-

cate horse-power.

22. These forms of retura and report are similar to those used by the Admiralty,

and, with the record of steamers for May, a register may be formed of the particu-

lars of dimensions, calculated quantities of displacement, area, mid-section, weight

of hidl, engine, stores, and draught, such as will enable a register to be formed of

all vessels, so that their coefficiency may be calculated.

                                                      Native Type.

   The steamer ' Forbes,' with engines of 120 horse-power, by Bolton and Watt,
similar to the ' Soho,' was built and commanded by me, and after establishing her
as a tug vessel at Calcutta in 1830, 1 proposed and carried out the project of towing
a ship to China, 3000 mUes, half of it against the monsoon, can-ying a cargo of opium
in advance of sailing vessels. This river-steamer was fitted for sea in one week after
the arrival of the * Jemasina,' a ship of 380 tons, which she towed; she was fitted
with false sides, which increased her breadth three feet, and also with Chinese
masts, and had an addition to her fimnel. The photograph which accompanied the
paper shows her as she arrived at Lintin, the outer anchorage of the port of Canton.
In India, the first river-tug for sea-service was fitted with Chinese masts and sails,

like a Chinese jimk.

   The lithogi-aph plan in red, Appendix B, which also accompanied the paper,
comprised comparative plans and sections of all the river-steamers, tugs, and tow-
barges, trains and flotillas that have been built, tried, and improved, so far as is
known from the published accounts, since 1858.

   The first are those of the East Indian Railway Company, on the Bengal system
of tug- and tow-boats of similar size,

   2ndly. The Indus Flotilla Company's steamer ' Stanley,' on tlie European system
of spoon-ended bow and stern. Also the large steamer, 360 feet long, recommended
by the Commission who visited the Rhone.

3rdly. The Oriental Inland Company's train of articulated barges (Bomne's patent),

consisting of one steamer and five barges, which may be called the theoretic system

of river navigation on the punt type.

4thly. The Nautilus Flotilla system of tug- and tow-boats, giving sheer and deck

plans of one tug- and three tow-boats of the ' Assam t}-pe,' as onginally tried on the
Thames, and of a steamer and two tow-boats as adopted from experience, and now

ready for fm-ther trials.

There are shown also the East Indian Eailway Company's vessels, the 'Ganges'

and 'Excelsior,' two large vessels built in Calcutta, and provided with locomotive

engines, with some particulars of their capability and fittings. Also the midship

mysections of four steamers built on   lines and fittings, the last of which, the ' Sir

James Melville,' sailed out to India with a false bottom, as proposed by me. As

to small boats, there are plans of the ' Sm-prise,' 85 feet long, towing two barges of

similar dimensions alongside. She has been extremely useful, and affords also a

fair contrast with the ' Assam Nautilus,' the one being 90 and the other 20 horse-

power.

  Eeference to Appendix B gives particulars of the East Indian Eailway Company's

fleet of ten steamers and barges ; also the result of the trial of Messrs. Vernon and

Sons' barges as to strength, which necessitated an additional strength of girder

equivalent to one-fifth, the vessel being reduced in length 25 feet, and the weight

added to the girders; two of the spoon-ended barges being reduced to 200 feet, the

bow of the fifth forming the stern of the sixth, with new bows of the ' Assam ' type

fitted to each, on plans furnished by me.

Of the test-trials of Messrs. Stevenson's trial steamer and barge, the residt is given

in a tabular form, at a light draught of steamer, at medium, and load draught; of

steamer and barge loaded to four feet, carrying 600 tons of cargo, ^vith engines of

596 1. H. P., at a speed of llj miles per hour.
   The East Indian Railway Company's fleet consists of ten large steamers and tow-

barges, employing a capital of about £2o0,000, with a boat establishment of three

small steamers, twelve large barges, 150 iron flats and cargo boats, averaging 90 feet,

and 200 or 300 iron and timber boats and oulacs, built in Bengal, besides the 50

mysailing boats or iron oulacs, built on the Thames, on  plan of Nautilus Flotilla

system and ' Assam ' tj'pe, at a cost of £'29,925, or £600 each, completed in Calcutta.

Thus £600,000, a capital guaranteed for railway purposes, has been invested by

the East Indian Railway Company in a fleet of large steamers and barges and small

steamers and boats, established for the conveyance of materials during the con-

struction of the line.

  --The Indus Flotilla Cmnpanj/. The ' Stanley ' experimental steamer (a sheer

plan of which is shown in the Plate, Appendix B, No. 1 and 2) gives the residts of
her trials on the Thames in 1838, as shown in tabular form : she required nearly

10 indicated horse-power to one square foot, mid section, to attain a speed of

thii-teen miles an hour, without cargo or tow-boat, while the East Indian Railway

Company's trial steamer and barge, tried in June 1859, with only 3 horse-power,

--attained a speed of 11^ miles an hour, can-ying 600 tons of cargo a practical test

of relative efficiency as to speed and capability for cargo of the ' Stanley.' The

difficulty of steering and towing on the Thames induced the addition of 121 feet to

the stem as a fender to the rudder, with a stage for steering as shown in plan.

The flotilla of steamers, barges, tugs, and cargo boats were contracted for in this

country in 1868. besides the ' Stanley,' six other passenger steamers, seven accom-

modation flats, also thirty-three cargo barges, and six tug steamers 100 feet long, with

engines 30 horse-power, built of corrugated iron. I find by an extract from ' The

Engineer ' of the 23rd of August, that the ' Stanley,' after a great many alterations
in engines and paddles, is still inefficient, and is now (July 1801) laid up awaiting a
new cylinder. Of the six passenger steamers it was stated that only one had been
partially tried, when it was found that the tubular boilers were inefficient, owing

to priming ; and of the small tug-boats only two were in use, and were unable to
tow the number of barges built for them. The above facts prove the necessity

for having thorough test-trials and improvements in this country before sending
--262 REPORT 1861.

vessels to India ; and it may be fairly estimated that it would require 10 per cent,

of the capital of £50,000 to place the seven large steamers and barges in an effi-

cient state for ser^-ice. If £10,000 had been spent in this country on trials, it would

have srved this expense and delay.

  W' vh respect to the six small tug and thirty-three corrugated tow-boats, some

expjriments 'were made on the Mersey in 1859, when I expressed to Sir James

Mjlville gi'eat doubt as to their power of tugging strength and durability,

.nd which has been verified by the accounts received in 1861. On that occasion

I strongly urged test-trials of the 'Assam Nautilus,' to test the capability of

the small boats ; and there can be no doubt that if 10 per cent, had been spent in

trials in this country, they woiUd have had efficient vessels as feeders to their line

early in 1860.

The capital invested is £500,000, the interest guaranteed by the Government of

India to the Indus Flotilla Company, which has constructed its vessels on the Euro-

pean system and spoon-ended type of build, contracted for on the railway or

myspeculative system adverted to in  re-view and letters to the Council in 1859.

From the experience of the last three years, it is a matter of consideration

whether the revenues of India will not be burdened with the interest of the capital

for many years to come.

barges, and 8-56 miles ^-ith one. Passing to the Indus, the steamer was sunk, by

collision with the 40-feet barge ; the experimental trials costing £15,000 in India.
The steamer ' Sutlej ' and one barge were lengthened 30 feet, and provided with

iTidders, and gre now employed towing astern in the usual way.
   The ' Jumna' (No. 4 plan) shows the alterations residting from an expenditure

of £34,000 on trials in India and England, which consist of the addition of two

side rudders to the steamer, and foui- barges additional to the length of stem ; for

the adoption of balanced rudder, and finer lines to bow ; with an engine and screw
to act as bow rudder.

At a preliminary tiial of the barges made on the Clyde, 26th September, the

speed varied from 6^ knots, with five barges ai-tieulated together, to 9| knots with
one barge, towed by the Clyde steamer ' Ruby,' of 100 N.H.P., working up to

neariy 800 Ind. H. P.

   At the request of the Directors, I was present at that trial, and made some expe-

    _

riments with the djTiamometer, of which a copy will be fm-nished. I then visited

the 'Jumna,' at Liverjjool, at their request, and there obtained much infomiation

from the engineer and late oflicers of the steamer ' Ganges,' which had foundered

on the voyage to Calcutta, and -naU be referred to afterwards.

                 On a Sledge Railway Break. By James HiGGrN".

   The author referred to the imperfect action of the ordinaiy railway breaks for
checking a train on the first warning of danger. His plan consisted not of merely

stopping the revolution of the wheels, but of placing under the carriages, over the
raUs, a lattice framework of iron, whose under surface, for a foot in breadth, re-
sembled a sledge. This sledge plate (about 16 ft. long on each side) reached do\vn
to within about 4 inches of the rails, and by half a tiu-n of an eccentric actuated by
a rod stretching under the carriages from the locomotive and worked by steam, the
carriages were instantly lowered and began to slide. In the case of a.xles brealiing,
the " sledge " arrangement would also afford support. The main advantage claimed
for the sledge break was, that the increased length of surface presented to the rails

obviates the jarring, dislocating and shaking which ensue when the wheels are sud-
denlylocked at a high rate of speed. Its application by steam power and complete
control by the engineer also ensure its instant application when needed ; and the
wheels will last longer from being spared the friction of the breaks and rails. But
the result of these advantages combmed being to enable a train to be brought to a
stop in a much shorter distance than is now eifected, was the most striking benefit

anticipated fi'om its introduction.

in taking a photographic coUodion negative, which is intensified by means of bi-

is satiu-ated with a solution of gelatine and bichromate of potash. The paper thus

prepared is exposed to the light beneath the negative, the result of which is that

the parts which have been exposed to the light become insoluble.^ The whole is

then inked with a gi-easy ink and afterwards washed in water, which removes the

   On the Application of the Direct- Action Principle. By W. B. JoHNSOjr.

   The author said that whilst immense improvements had been made in almost

every other class of machineiy, the stationary beam-engine remained ahnost in the

same state as when it left the hands of the earliest makers, and may consequently

be regarded as one of the most imperfect pieces of mechanism of the present day.
Comparing the beam with the direct-action engine, he said the latter are superior
in the following points : viz., they are independent of the foundation and engine-
room walls for sti-ength and support ; they are less liable to derangement and
breakage, and such cases are attended vdth less serious results ; offering also great
advantages ia the accessibility to the condensing apparatus and all other working

parts of the engine.

On the Besistance of Ships. By Professor W. J. MACQTroKN Rankine, F.B.S.

The author states that the investigation to which this paper relates w^as founded

originally on experimental data supplied to him by Mr. James E. Napier in 1857,

and that its results were successfully applied to practice in 1858 and subsequently,

to calculate beforehand the engine-power required to drive at given speeds ships

built by Mr. J. R. Napier. He refers to pre\ious investigations of the effect of

friction  in  resisting  the  motion  of a  ship  through  the  water                               but remarks that

those investigations could not be expected to yield definite results, because in them

the velocity of sliding of the particles of water over the ship's bottom was treated

as sensibly equal to the speed of the ship ; whereas that velocity must vary at

different points of the ship's bottom, in a manner depending on the positions of

those points and the figure of the ship, being on an average greater than the speed

be expressed approximately, for practical purposes, by comparatively simple rules.

Examples are given of the application of those rules to experiments by Mr. J. R.

Napier, the author, and others, on steam-ships of very various sizes,' forms, and

speed.

 --The principal conclusions an-ived at are : that friction constitutes the most

important part, if not the whole, of the resistance to the motion of ships that are

well formed for speed ; that its amount can be deduced with great precision from

the form of the ship, by proper mathematical processes ; that the engine-power

required to overcome it varies nearly as the cube of the speed, and as a quantity

called the "_ augmented surface," which is the quantity to be considered iu fixing

the dimensions of propellers                                                                                                                                   that the friction consists" of two parts, one increasing

and the other diminishing with the length of the vessel ; that the least resistance

for a given displacement and speed is given by a proportion of length to breadth

which is somewhere about sei^en to one, and that excess of length is the best side to
en- on. The author states as limitations to his theory, that it does not give the entire

resistance of vessels that are so blufi" as to push before them or drag behind them

masses of " dead water," nor of vessels so small for their speed as to raise waves

that bury a considerable pai-t of their bows; and from the latter limitation he

deduces precautions to be observed in making experiments on models, in order that

the results may be applicable to large ships.

This appendix contains a comparison between the sailing yachts 'Themis'

(formerly ' Titania ') and ' America,' founded on their published plans. The author

shows, that although, from the gi-eater size of the * America,' and especially from

the gTeater area and breadth of her load water-line, her capacity for caiTying sail

must be greater than that of the ' Themis,' the " augmented surfaces " of those two

vessels are almost exactly equal ; so that, according to the theory set forth in the

it might have been, if those sections had been nearly triangular, as they are in the

                       and other Machinery. By J. Robinson,

   The author made some observations upon the planing machine, the slide-lathe,

the screw-cutting lathe, giving any range of motion ; the radial drill, the slot drill,
the key grooving machine, the shaping machine, the bolt and nut cutting machine,
&c. The steam-hammer, the punching machine, the riveting machine, were also
dilated upon. The last-named was worked by hydraulic power, by Sir William
Armstrong. The export of machinery, from 1856 to 1860, amounted to £17,000,000.

No siich quantity of machinery could have been made and exported, he submitted,

  On Iron Construction ; with Bemarks on the Strength of Iron Columns and
                        Arches. By F. W. Sheilds, M.I.O.E.

   The author remarked, that in various constructions, such as bridges, ships, and
roofs, the materials formerly xised were being rapidly superseded by iron. Nor was
this change coniined to England and the seats of iron manufacture alone. In fact,
it appeared almost anomalous that a bridge of this costly material, conveyed from
England at great expense, should supersede with economy, in Australia, India,

Russia, or Spain, the apparently cheaper materials found in abundance on the spot.

   The explanation of this apparent anomaly is found in the gi-eater strength of
iron, size for size, than of the other materials, and in its capacity for being manu-
factured in such varied shapes and sizes, that just so much scantling may be
given to each part of a structure as will meet the strain on that part, without any
being wasted or lost to use. In a framing, an undue increase of scantling to some
of its parts does not add strength to the whole structure, as its endurance is
limited by the strength of its weakest part ; and such increase but involves the
addition of useless weight and expense, besides endangering the stability of the

construction by the failure of its weaker portions.
   It is therefore requisite, on the gi-ounds not only of economy but of safety, that

practical men dealing with ironwork should be versed in calculating the strains
upon such framings. The author would not attempt here to give an abstract of
these principles, as he had briefly stated them in a recent publication on the strains

on structures of ironwork ; but in the more simple cases of the resistance to
pressure of columns and arches, he would state the results of his experience.
After allusion to the experiments of Messrs. Fairbaim and Eaton Hodgkmson, he
stated that, from large experience in the construction of the Crystal Palace at
Sydenham and other works, he had adopted the following rules for the safe load
borne by cast-iron columns of good construction, with flat ends and with base-plates
at their bearings. For hollow colunms of 20 to 24 diameters in length,

tion of double-flanged girders is not affected by the mode of construction adopted
in the web ; in other words, if two girders of equal length and depth, one a lattice,
the other a plate girder, have the same strains per sectional unit transmitted thi-ough
their flanges, they will both deflect to the same extent. Also, when a girder is of
uniform strength, that is, when aU parts are equally proportioned to the transmitted
strain, the deflection-curve v.nl\ be a cii-cle, and the central deflection may be simply
expressed by the following equation

                                 By T. Webstee, F.B.S.

   The author pointed out that considerations of public policy had led to certain rules
or laws respecting the use and enjoyment of all property, and that the same principles
to which the origin of aU property is to be referred had peculiar claims to recogni-
tion with regard to the inventor. To say that an inventor may retain command
over his invention by secrecy is to propose an impossibility in a majority of cases,
and in a few cases in which it might be done the ettect would be to convei-t his art
into a mystery and to introduce practices long since condemned. _ The author pointed

out the fallacy of stigmatizing patents as contrary to the principle of free ti-ade, as

was commonly done. He admitted the injury done by the iudiscriminate gi-ant of

patents ; and this, which might be remedied, ought not to be used as an argument

against the system. He pointed out that although for small inventioJls and such

as could be quickly introduced a patent might not be needed, yet that where time
and capital were required to introduce the inventions into use, such inventions would
not be made and perfected useless the inventors were protected fi'om piracy by

letters patent. He thought the cases of obstmction, in practice, were more imagi-

nary than real. The law admitted of successive patents for improvements, and
practically it was rare that a prior inventor would not come to reasonable terms
with a subsequent one. At all events, the case might be met by applying to this
species of property that which the legislature had already applied to other Muds of
property, viz., the powers of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, where lands
were taken compidsorily, and compel patentees to grant licenses upon equitable

terms.

 On the Causes of the Phenomena of Cyclones. By Isaac Ashe, A.B., M.B.

   The author criticised ]\ir. Redfield's view of the formation of cyclones, as given
in Smiman's Journal, vol. xxxiii. p. 56, namely, that they are formed by the meet-
ing in the upper regions of the atmosphere of two cmi-ents, a hot and a cold, which,
infolding each other, generate a horizontal rotation in a body of air, and that, one
extremity of this rotating body of air descending to the earth, the horizontal rota-
tion is changed to a vertical one. Such a view would not account for the fact that
the rotation is invariably from left to right in the southern hemisphere, and from
right to left in the northern, as the direction of the vertical rotation would be altered
according as it would be one or the other extremity of the vertically rotatingbody
of air that chanced to descend to the earth. Mr. Ashe considered that the inva-
riably observed phenomenon pointed to a cause admitting of no variation, and sug-
gested that, in consequence of the dim-nal rotation of the earth being slower as we
go polewards, a volume of air, rushing towards a centre of rarefaction near the
                                                                                             '

equator, would, if it came from polewards, proceed westward of the centre of rare-
faction, and if it came from the equatorial side, would proceed to eastward of it, and
that the two currents thus meeting would form a mechanical " couple " of forces,
and generate a rotation which, it will be easily seen, must be invariably from left to

right in the southern hemisphere, and from right to left in the northern, as is the

fact.

   He corroborated this view by the consideration that, according to it, cyclones

--should not be formed near the equator, since the " couple " of forces would there be-

come nearly opposite a view exactly in accordance with observed facts ; whereas,
on Mr. Redfield's hypothesis, they ought to be oftener found there, since at the
equator the smface and upper cuiTents of the atmosphere become interchanged, and
so would have a tendency to produce horizontal rotation, as assumed by him.
 · The author suggested that rarefaction might be produced by the latent heat
evolved by a copious precipitation of aqueous vapour in any particular region, as-
senting to Col. Keid's view that cyclones are not caused by' islands.
. With regard to the continued ascent of air in a cyclone, the author criticised Mr.
Redfield's views as expressed in the following extract from ' Silliman's Journal,'

--vol. xxxiii. p. 59, ascribed in the Index to that writer, viz. : " The condition of force

by which the propulsion is maintained is found in the pressure of the surrounding
atmosphere iipon all sides of the whirling and therefore mechanically rarefied co-
liunn; and if the expansive whuiing motion be sufficiently active to produce
nearly a vacuum at the centre, the external propelling force will be nearly 15 lbs.
to the square inch." The author observed that the pressure, as registered by the
barometer, never exceeded about 1 lb. to the square inch ; and contended that if
even this pressure were to operate as a motive force at all, it would cause, not con-

--tinuance of the rotation, but total coUapse of the cyclone from the bottom upwards,
    a conclusion which he illustrated by the disappearance of a water-spout in this
manner, and also by an experiment with a bottle containing some water in a state
of rapid rotation, in which a similar result was shown to follow from the pressure

of the column of water as the centeifugal force declined. He considered that the

external pressiu-e of the atmosphere was the effect, and not the cause, of the continu-
ance of the cyclone, and suggested as a cause of this continuance the passage of a

current of air over the top of the cyclone, in the upper regions of the atmosphere,

analogous to the draught similarly caused in a chimney ; since Maiu-y has shown
that such a cm-rent actually exists in the upper atmosphere, blowing in a direction

the reverse of the trade-wind, the rotating coliunn of air composing the cyclone
being capable of being regarded as a chimney. The author had observed that such
a current, passing over the top of the fimnel of a steamer, caused the smoke to rotate
in two spu-al colimms, foldmg into each other below on the leeward side of the
funnel ; so that if a person stood facing the funnel with his back to the wind, the
left-hand column would coiTespond, ruside the fimnel, with the cyclones of the
southern hemisphere, and the right-hand column with those of the northern. Since
such an upper cm-rent, as shown by Maury, wovdd descend and become a sm-face-

ciirrent at the tropics, we might expect cyclones often to die out here; and the author

refen-ed to the opinion of Lieut. Fyers, E,.E., Secretary to the Meteorological So-
ciety_ of Mauritius, that such was sometimes the fact, as in the case of the Mamitius

hurricane of November 1854, as evidenced by the log of the ship ' Sesostris ' (see

' Transactions of the Meteorological Society of Mam-itius,' vol. iii. p. 18). Mr. Ashe
also exhibited a chart of storms traced in the South Indian Ocean by the above-
mentioned Society, in which, out of twelve storms, only one was traceable as far
as 29° S. lat., while ten could not be traced beyond 25° S.

  _ The shape of a cyclone the author considered to be, not really circular, but ellip-
tical, the major axis rimning from west to east, and the vortex being on the east
side of the minor axis, since this figure would result from the fact that a particle
of air proceeding towards the vortex from polewards would go more to the west-
ward than a particle coming from the same distance on the side of the equator
would go to eastwards of the vortex, owing to the increasing ratio with which the
circumferences diminish in the circles formed by the parallels of latitudes as the

distance of these from the equator increases ; for the radii of these circles ai-e equal
 to the cosines of angles increasing in arithmetical progi-ession from 0° to 90°.
Hence Mr. Ashe deduced that the westernmost portion of the cyclone would be the
268 REPORT 1861.

most slowly rotating, considering the cyclone merely with reference to its own in-
ternal motion of rotation, and not with reference to the difference which would be
perceived by a ship at sea, the latter being due to the fact that one side of a cyclone
moved with the trade-wind, and the opposite against it, and resulting in a general

translation of the entire cyclone, along with the trade-wind, to be considered sepa-
rately ; but the most westerly quarter of the cyclone being the slowest moving aa

regards its own internal rotation, it follows that the cyclone will progress along a

line at a tangent to this, that is to say, southwards or nearly so in the southern
hemisphere, and northwards or nearly so in the northern hemisphere, the direction

of rotation being here the reverse of what it is in the southern hemisphere. Com-

bining this, the proper motion of the cyclone, with the motion derived from the
trade-wind, both being represented by the dotted lines in the annexed figure of a

cyclone in the southern hemisphere, we obtain the actual motion in a direction S. W.

                                                             An

--or thereabouts, as indicated by the continuous line in the figure, a result corre-

sponding exactly with what is observed to be in fact the case. Similarly in the
northern hemisphere, combining the proper motion of the cyclone, which on this
theory would be about north, -with the S.W. motion derived from the trade-wind,
we should have the actiial motion of the cyclone in a north-west direction, which
again corresponds exactly with the fact as obser\-ed within the tropics. Since the
causes above inferred to produce the proper motion of the cyclone would act less
powerfidly near the equator, it follows, on this theory, that the actual motion of
the cyclone would be slower there than at subsequent portions of its course, which
is constantly observed to be the ease ; and a chiirt of a remarkable stoiin, which
occmTcd near Mauritius in January 1855, was laid before the Section by the author

(see vol. iii. p. 23, ' Transactions of the Meteorological Society of Mauritius '), in

which this was manifested in a striking degree, in consequence, as supposed by Mr,

--Ashe, of the influence of the ti-ade-wind being at a minimum at that season a view

supported by the direction in which the storm travelled, which was S.S.E., corre-
sponding very nearly with the proper motion of cyclones in the southern hemi-
sphere, as deduced above.

    In all cases in which the influence of the ti-ade-wind is nil, whether owing to the

season or the latitude, we would expect that a cyclone proceeding rapidly polewards
would derive considerable easting from the circumstance of its having left lower

latitudes where the diumfil rotation is more rapid than in the places it is arriving at.
    Mr. Ashe regarded the recurving so constantly observed in cyclones in the South

Indian Ocean as being due to this circumstance, and exhibited a chart containing
the obser^-ed tracks of several cyclones (see chart i. vol. iii. of ' Transactions of the
Meteorological Society of Mauritius '), to show on the one hand that the recurving
is not O'wing to the presence of the island of Mauritius, as commonly supposed,
 since several of the cyclones recurved in open sea far from land, and, on the other

--hand, that the recurv ing was to be connected with the laritude, as it occurred, as

shown in the chart, just where the component of motion due to the trade-wind was
vanishing, and the cyclone was assuming its own proper motion in a southerly
 direction, with easting derived from the cause above mentioned.

    In the case of cyclones in the North Atlantic, the author referred the recurving
 observed about the peninsida of Florida to the same causes, it being in about the
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                        269

same latitude north, aided, no doubt, by the continent of North Amarica, which,
extending for thousands of miles, is verj^ different from the small island of Mauri-
tius, only 30 miles across, and along the coast-edge of which the cyclone rolls like
a wheel along a plane surface. The slight westward trending of the direction of
the trade-wind, as we go further from the equator, would undoubtedly tend to pro-
duce a slight southerly deflection of the cyclone from an early part of its course,
which deflection would be aided by the increase of speed in the proper motion of

the cyclone due to the causes above mentioned ; and such deflection is exhibited
in the charts produced by the author.

   In accordance with this theorj' also we would expect that, as the force of the
trade-wind must increase from the summer to the winter solstice, we should have

a northerly trending of the track of cyclones during that period, due to this increase
of force in this component of their motion ; and, to show that facts were in accord-
ance with this theory, Mr. Ashe quoted the following passage from a paper read by

--Lieut. Fyers, R.E., reported in the ' Transactions of the Meteorological Society of

Mauritius,' 1855, p. 58, viz. : "As far as my experience goes, the November and De-

cember storms invariably take a southern course to the eastward of Rodriguez, and,

as the season advances, in January, February, and March, they take a more west-
erly direction, sometimes passing north of Mauritius and continuing to the coast

--of Madagascar, at others passing between Rodiiguez and Mamitius," a statement

which, on referring to the map, and recollecting that the writer took his point of

view from Mam-itius, we find exactly to correspond with a northerly trending of the

track of cyclones during those months.

   The increase in diameter, and decrease in violence of a cyclone, as it progresses,
Mr. Ashe attributed to the engagement of more air in the rotatory motion, owing to
the friction exercised by the walls, as it were, of the cyclone against the smTOund-

ing atmosphere, while, as the force did not increase in consequence, the velocity of

the mass moved would necessarily diminish.
