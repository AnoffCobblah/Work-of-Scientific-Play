          REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

BeiJort of the Council for the Year 1894-95, presented to the General
        Committee at Tpsioich on Wednesday, September 11, 1895.

     The Report of the Council for 1894-5 was considered and ordered
to be presented to the General Committee :

     The Council have received reports from the General Treasurer

during the past year, and his accounts from July 1, 1894, to June 29,
1895, which have been audited, will be presented to the General
Committee.

     The Council have nominated the Mayor of Ipswich, J. H. Bartlet,

Esq., M.D., Vice-President of the Association.

     The invitation to hold the Annual Meeting of the Association at
Toronto in 1897 has been renewed, and will be brought before the
General Committee on Monday.

     The election by the General Committee of Sir Douglas Galton as
President of the Association for the year which begins to-day, deprives
us for the future of his services as General Secretary. The Council desire
to record their grateful sense of the unfailing zeal and energy which Sir
Douglas Galton has displayed in the affairs of the Association during a
tenure of office which has extended over twenty-four years. The Council
have consequently had to consider the appointment of a successor, and
desire now to nominate Professor E. A. Schiifer, F.R.S., for election to the
office of General Secretary. Professor Schafer has been communicated
with, and has expi-essed his willingness to serve.

     In accordance with a request received from the Lords of the Committee

of Council on Education, who have been asked to send Delegates to the

International Congress of Zoology at Leyden, the Council resolved to

nominate Sir W. H. Flower to represent the Association.

     Resolutions referred to the Council for consideration and action if

desirable :
            --

            REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                                    Ixyxi

(1) That the Council of the Association be requested to give their full support

    to the efforts being made to induce the Government to send out a fully-

    equipped expedition for the exploration of the Antarctic and Southern Seaa.

     In reference to this resolution, the Secretaries received the following

communication from Mr. Clements R. Markham, President of the Royal

Geographical Society :

' I have the honour to bring to the notice of the Council of the British

Association the steps that have been taken, within the last year, with a

view to the renewal of Antarctic research.

     'On November 27, 1893, a very important and interesting paper was
read to a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society by Dr. John Murray,
of the " Challenger " Expedition, a copy of which is enclosed. The argu-

ments and the detailed information contained in Dr. Murray's paper

appeared to my Council to place the importance of renewing Antarctic re-

search in such a convincing light that they resolved to take action in the
matter. I, therefore, appointed a Committee of experts to report upon
the points bearing on the renewal of Antarctic research, and on the

despatch of an expedition.

    ' On the receipt of the Report of this Society's Antarctic Committee, a

copy of which I enclose, the Secretary of the Royal Society was addressed

with a view to the matter receiving the consideration of the Council
of that influential body. It was referred to a very strong Committee,

which made its report last May, a copy of which is enclosed. The
Report of this Committee of the Royal Society dwells chiefly on the
requirements of magnetism, and shows the necessity for despatching an

Antarctic Expedition for the completion of magnetic observations, which
are both of scientific and practical importance. The Committee also

points out that many other branches of science besides magnetism will be

largely advanced by such an expedition ; and, referring to the present

condition of the ice in the southern circumpolar region, it considers that

the despatch of an expedition may assume a character of urgency.

     ' It is very encouraging to find that the President and Council of the

Royal Society, as I am informed in a letter from the Secretary, a copy of

which is enclosed, fully indorse the views of the Committee as regards the

great scientific importance of the results of Antarctic research.

     ' The Council of the Royal Society, however, considered it their duty
to raise the subject of expense, and in a private interview at the Admiralty

a Deputation was informed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as then

advised, could only confirm a doubt that had been raised whether the

Imperial finances could bear the expense of the proposed expedition.

     'At the present juncture the question of the cost of the expedition is

irrelevant. An exaggerated estimate may have been made by those

who are unacquainted with the arrangement of heads of account and

other details, and who have not taken various collateral points into con-
sideration. It will be for the members of the Deputation eventually

selected by the united scientific and other bodies to ascertain the actual

cost, and to place themselves in a position to answer all questions of

expense, when the proper time comes for the subject of Antarctic research
being brought before Her Majesty's Government for favourable considera-
tion. They will, I believe, be able to show that the trifling expense bears
no comparison with the gain to science; to the Navy, and to Imperial

interests.

Ixxxii  --REPORT 1895.

     ' Meanwhile tlie time has come for the leading scientific bodies of the
Empire to declare, as regards their various departments, that they concur
in the view already expressed by the Eoyal Society, the Royal Geo-
graphical Society, and the British Association, that a renewal of Antarctic
research is of great importance to science.

     ' The Council of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science was the body through whose influential representations the
memorable expedition led by Sir James Ross was despatched to the
Antarctic regions. True to its excellent traditions, your Council has
invariably given its support to similar proposals, and I therefore feel

confident that the British Association will retain its place in the front

rank of those who seek to promote the advancement of science by

Antarctic research.

     ' The President and the Council of the Royal Geographical Society
now request that you will once more bring the question of the results of
Antarctic discovery to the notice of your Council for serious consideration,
with a view to co-operation and to the undertaking being unanimously
advocated by the scientific societies of Great Britain and Ireland.'

     The Council resolved to express their sympathy with, and approval
of, the effort which is being made by the Royal Geographical Society to
organise an expedition for the exploration of the Antarctic Sea, but did
not consider that any further action could usefully be taken by them at

present.

         (2) That the Council be requested to call the attention of the Civil Service

            Commissioners to the Report of a Committee of Section F on the Methods

              of Economic Training, and especially to tlie recommendations (contained on
              page 2) with regard to the position of Economics in the Civil Service
               Examinations.

     The following are the passages referred to in the Resolution :
     ' In most Continental countries Economics occupies a place more
or less prominent in the courses of training and in the examinations
through which candidates for the legal profession or the Civil Service
have to pass. . . .

     ' The two studies are cognate, and according to the view of your Com-
mittee not only would the institution of an examination in Economics at
some stage of legal degrees and qualifications be advantageous profession-
ally, but the work of those who had enjoyed a legal training would react
favourably on the advance of the science. In addition. Economics should
receive a much more important place in the Civil Service Examinations,
and should, if possible, be made compulsory on those entering the higher

branches.'

     The Council, after considering this question, referred it to a Com-
mittee, consisting of the President and Officers, with Professors H. Sidg-
wick, Foxwell, and Edgeworth. The report of the Committee was as

follows ;

     ' Legal studies and qualifications for the position of Barrister-at-Law
depend entirely on the Inns of Court, and they believe that the Civil
Service Commissioners have no influence over the legal examinations.

     ' The recommendations proposed with regard to the Civil Service is
that Economics should, if possible, be made compulsory on those who

enter the higher branches of the Service. This proposal, if carried out,

would produce an entire revolution in the mode of appointing to the Civil

Service ; for, as a rule, examinations are restricted to the first entry, and
are not imposed on persons proceeding from a lower grade to a higher.

     ' It is also worthy of mature consideration whether the present is a
favourable juncture for pressing on the Government a more rigid demand
for economic knowledge from its servants, when the science itself is the
subject of keen contention, and two schools of thought, diametrically
opposed to each other, have arisen, to some extent in this country, and to

a much greater extent on the Continent.
     'The Committee, in view of these considerations, recommend that any

further action on this matter be postponed.'
     This report was adopted by the Council.
     The report of the Corresponding Societies Committee for the past

year, consisting of the list of the Corresponding Societies, and the titles
of the more important papers, and especially those referring to Local
Scientific Investigations, published by those Societies during the year
ending June 1, 1895, has been received.

     The account of the Conference of Delegates at Oxford has, in accord-
ance with a resolution of the Council, been published in the Rej^ort for

1894.

      REPORT 1895.

                     Regulations regarding Grants of Money.
The regulations were revised, and are given on p, xxxii.

       Resolutions referred to the Council for consideration, and action

                                                       if desirable.

     That the Council be requested to consider whether it be desirable to take steps
in order to bring the following resolution under the notice of H.M. Government and

the Trustees of the British Museum :

     ' That in view of the importance of preserving the remains of the various civilisa-
tions of this Empire which are fast disappearing, and in order to prevent the loss

and dispersion of collections of ancient and modern Anthropology which may be

offered to the nation, it is highly desirable to acquire less costly and far more
extended storehouse space than can be provided in London.'

     That the Council be requested to bring before the Government the importance of

securing for the National Collections the type collection of preparations of Fossil

Plants left by the late Professor W. C. WiUiamson.

     That it is desirable to reprint collections of the Addresses delivered by the
Presidents of Sections in separate volumes for sale.

     That the Council be requested to provide the Geological Survey maps and
sections of the district in which the Association meets each year, to be placed in
a conspicuous position in the Meeting Room of Section C.

   SIE DOUGLAS GALTON, KC.B., D.C.L., F.E.S.

                                 PRESIDENT.

   My first duty is to convey to you, JMr. Mayor, and to the inhabitants of

   Ipswich, the thanks of the British Association for your hospitable invita-

tion to hold our sixty-fifth meeting in your ancient town, and thus to recall

the agreeable memories of the similar favour Avhich your predecessors con-

ferred on the Association forty-four years ago.

    In the next place I feel it my duty to say a few words on the

--great loss which science has recently sustained the death of the Hight

Hon. Thomas Henry Huxley. It is unnecessary for me to enlarge,
in the presence of so many to whom his personality was known, upon

his charm in social and domestic life ; but upon the debt which the

Association owes to him for the assistance which he rendered in the
promotion of science I cannot well be silent. Huxley was preeminently

qualified to assist in sweeping away the obstruction by dogmatic au-
thority, which in the early days of the Association fettered progress in

certain branches of science. For, whilst he was an eminent leader in

biological research, his intellectual power, his original and intrepid mind,

his vigorous and masculine English, made him a writer who explained the

deepest subject with transparent clearness. And as a speaker his lucid

and forcible style was adorned with ample and effective illustration in the

lecture-room                                                            and  his  energy  and wealth  of  argument  in  a  more public
                                                                     ;

arena largely helped to win the battle of evolution, and to secure for us

the right to discuss questions of religion and science without fear and

without favour.

   It may, I think, interest you to learn that Huxley first made the
                                                                                          b2

acquaintance of Tyndall at the meeting of the Association held in this
town in 1851.

     About forty-six years ago I first began to attend the meetings of the
British Association ; and I was elected one of your general secretaries

about twenty-five years ago.
      It is not unfitting, therefore, that I should recall to your minds the

conditions under which science was pursued at the formation of the Asso-
ciation, as well as the very remarkable position which the Association

has occupied in relation to science in this country.

     Between the end of the sixteenth century and the early part of the
present century several societies had been created to develop various
branches of science. Some of these societies were established in London,
and others in important provincial centres.

     In 1831, in the absence of I'ailways, communication between difl'erent
parts of the country was slow and difficult. Science was therefore local-
ised ; and in addition to the universities in England, Scotland, and Ire-
land, the towns of Birmingham, Manchester, Plymouth and York each
maintained an important nucleus of scientific research.

                          Origin of the British Association.

     Under these social conditions the British Association was founded in

September 1831.
     The general idea of its formation was derived from a migratory

society which had been previously formed in Germany ; but whilst the
German society met for the special occasion on which it was summoned,
and then dissolved, the basis of the British Association was continuity.

     The objects of the founders of the British Association were enunciated
in their earliest rules to be :

     ' To give a stronger impulse and a more systematic direction to scien-
tific inquiry ; to promote the intercourse of those who cultivated science
in diSerent parts of the British Empire with one another, and with
foreign philosophers ; to obtain a more general attention to the objects of
science, and a removal of any disadvantages of a public kind which im-
pede its progress.'

     Thus the British Association for the Advancement of Science based
its utility upon the opportunity it afibrded for combination.

     The first meeting of the Association was held at York with 353
members.

    As an evidence of the want which the Association supplied, it may be

mentioned that at the second meeting, which was held at Oxford, the
number of members was 435. The third meeting, at Cambridge, numbered
over 900 members, and at the meeting at Edinburgh in 1831 there were
present 1,298 members.

    At its third meeting, which was held at Cambridge in 1833, the

Association, through the influence it had already acquired, induced the
                                                                                                                  :

                                                                     ADDRESS.                                  5

Government to grant a sum of 500?. for the reduction of the astronomical

observations of Baily. And at the same meeting the General Committee

commenced to appropriate to scientific research the surplus from the sub-

scriptions of its members. The committees on each branch of science

were desired ' to select definite and important objects of science, which

they may think most fit to be advanced by an application of the funds of

the society, either in compensation for labour, or in defraying the expense

of apparatus, or otherwise, stating their reasons for their selection, and,

when they may think proper, designating individuals to undertake the

desired investigations.'

The several proposals were submitted to the Committee of Recommen-

dations, whose approval was necessary before they could be passed by the

General Committee. The regulations then laid down still guide the
Association in the distribution of its grants. At that early meeting the

Association was enabled to apply 600?. to these objects.

I have always wondered at the foresight of the framers of the

constitution of the British Association, the most remarkable feature of

which is the lightness of the tie which holds it together. It is not bound

by any complex central organisation. It consists of a federation of

Sections, whose youth and energy are yearly renewed by a succession of

presidents and vice-presidents, whilst in each Section some continuity

of action is secured by the less movable secretaries.

The governing body is the General Committee, the members of which are

selected for their scientific work ; but their controlling power is tempered
by the law that all changes of rules, or of constitution, should be submitted

to, and receive the approval of, the Committee of Recommendations. This

committee may be described as an ideal Second Chamber. It consists of
the most experienced members of the Association.

The administration of the Association in the interval between annual

meetings is carried on by the Council, an executive body, whose duty it
is to complete the work of the annual meeting (a) by the publication of

its proceedings                                            (b)  by giving effect to resolutions passed by the  General
                                                        ;

Committee                                       (c)        it  also  appoints  the Local  Committee  and  organises the

2}ersonnel of each Section for the next meeting.

I believe that one of the secrets of the long-continued success and

vitality of the British Association lies in this purely democratic constitu-

tion, combined with the compulsory careful consideration which must be

given to suggested organic changes.

The Association is now in the sixty-fifth year of its existence. In

its origin it invited the philosophical societies dispersed throughout Great

Britain to unite in a co-operative union.

Within recent years it has endeavoured to consolidate that union.

At the present time almost all important local scientific societies

scattered throughout the country, some sixty-six in number, are in corre-

spondence with the Association. Their delegates hold annual conferences

at our meetings. The Association has thus extended the sphere of its action
 --6 REPORT 1895.

 it places the members of the local societies engaged in scientific work
  in relation with each other, and brings them into co-operation -with
 members of the Association and with others engaged in oiiginal in^esti-
 gations, and the papers whicli the individual societies publish annually
 are catalogued in our Report. Thus by degrees a national catalogue
 will be formed of the scientific work of these societies.

      The Association has, moreover, shown that its scope is coterminous
 with the British Empire by holding one of its annual meetings at Montreal,
 and we are likely soon to hold a meeting in Toronto.

           Condition of certain Sciences at the formation of the
                                            British Association.

      The Association, at its first meeting, began its work by initiating a
 series of reports upon the then condition of the several sciences.

    A rapid glance at some of these reports will not only show the enor-

 mous strides which have been made since 1831 in the investigation of
 facts to elucidate the laws of Nature, but it may afford a slight insight
 into the impediments ofiei'ed to the progress of investigation by the
 mental condition of the community, which had been for so long satisfied

 to accept assumptions without undergoing the labour of testing their

 truth by ascertaining the real facts. This habit of mind may be illustrated
 by two instances selected from the early reports made to the Associa-
 tion. The first is afforded by the report made in 1832, by Mr. Lubbock,

 on ' Tides.'
      This was a subject necessarily of importance to England as a dominant

 power at sea. But in England records of the tides had only recently been
 commenced at the dockyards of Woolwich, Sheerness, Portsmouth, and
 Plymouth, on the request of the Royal Society, and no information had
 been collected upon the tides on the coasts of Scotland and Ireland.

     The British Association may feel pride in the fact that within three

years of its inception, viz. by 1834, it had induced the Corporation of
Liverpool to establish two tide gauges, and the Government to undertake
tidal observations at 500 stations on the coasts of Britain.

      Another cognate instance is exemplified by a paper read at the second
meeting, in 1832, upon the State of Naval Architecture in Great Britain.
The author contrasts the extreme perfection of the carpentry of the internal
fittings of the vessels with the I'emarkable deficiency of mathematical
theory in the adjustment of the external form of vessels, and suggests

the benefit of the application of refined analysis to the various practical
problems which ought to interest shipbuilders--problems of capacity, of
displacement, of stowage, of velocity, of pitching and rolling, of masting,

of the effects of sails and of the resistance of fluids ; and, moreover, sug-
gests that large-scale experiments should be made by Government, to
afford the necessary data for calculation.

     Indeed, when we consider how completely the whole habit of mind of
the populations of the Western world has been changed, since the beginning

of the century, from willing acceptance of authority as a rule of life to a
universal spirit of inquiry and experimental investigation, is it not pro-
bable that this rapid change has arisen from society having been stirred
to its foundations by the causes and consequences of the French Revolu-

tion 1

One of the earliest practical i-esults of this awakening in France was

the conviction that the basis of scientific research lay in the accuracy of

the standards by which observations could be compared ; and the follow-

ing principles were laid down as a basis for their measurements of length,

weight, and capacity : viz. (1) that the unit of linear measure applied
to matter in its three forms of extension, viz., length, breadth, and

thickness, should be the standard of measures of length, surface, and

solidity                        (2)  that the cubic  contents of  the  linear measure in  decimetres
                             ;

of pure water at the temperature of its greatest density should furnish at

once the standard weight and the measure of capacity. · The metric sys-
tem did not come into full operation in France till 1840 ; and it is now

adopted by all countries on the continent of Europe except Russia.

The standards of length which were accessible in Great Britain at the

formation of the Association were the Parliamentary standard yard lodged

in the Houses of Parliament (which was destroyed in 1834 in the fire

which burned the Houses of Parliament) ; the Royal Astronomical

Society's standard ; and the 10-foot bar of the Ordnance Survey.

The first two were assumed to afford exact measurements at a given

temperature. The Ordnance bar was formed of two bars on the principle

of a compensating pendulum, and aflbrded measurements independent

of temperature. Standard bars were also disseminated throughout the

country, in possession of the corporations of various towns.

The British Association early recognised the importance of uniformity

in the record of scientific facts, as well as the necessity for an easy method

of comparing standards and for verifying difTerences between instruments

and apparatus required by various observers pursuing similar lines of

investigation. At its meeting at Edinburgh in 1834 it caused a com-

parison to be made between the standard bar at Aberdeen, constructed by

Troughton, and the standard of the Royal Astronomical Society, and

reported that the scale ' was exceedingly well finished ; it was about

^^Jjgth of an inch shorter than the 5 -feet of the Royal Astronomical
Society's scale, but it was evident that a great number of minute, yet

important, circumstances have hitherto been neglected in the formation

of such scales, without an attention to which they cannot be expected

to accord with that degree of accuracy which the present state of science

demands.' Subsequently, at the meeting at Newcastle in 1863, the

Association appointed a committee to report on the best means of

providing for a uniformity of weights and measures with reference to the

    ' The litre is the volume of a kilogramme of pure water at its maximum density,

and is slightly less than the litre was intended to be, viz., one cubic decimetre. The

weight of a cubic decimetre of pure water is 1-000013 kilogrammes.

interests of science. This committee recommended the metric decimal

--system a recommendation which has been endorsed by a committee

of the House of Commons in the last session of Parliament.

     British instrument-makers had been long conspicuous for accuracy of
workmanship. Indeed, in the eighteenth century practical astronomy had
been mainly in the hands of British observers ; for although the mathe-
maticians of France and other countries on the continent of Europe were
occupying the foremost place in mathematical investigation, means of
astronomical observation had been furnished almost exclusively by English

artisans.

     The sectors, quadrants, and circles of Ramsden, Bird, and Gary were
inimitable by Continental workmen.

     But the accuracy of the mathematical-instrument maker had not

penetrated into the engineei''s workshop. And the foundation of the

British Association was coincident with a rapid development of mechanical

appliances.

     At that time a good workman had done well if the shaft he was turn-

ing, or the cylinder he was boring, ' was right to the ^'sud of an inch.'

 This was, in fact, a degree of accuracy as fine as the eye could usually

 distinguish.

     Eew mechanics had any distinct knowledge of the method to be pur-
sued for obtaining accuracy ; nor, indeed, had practical men sufficiently

 appreciated either the immense importance or the comparative facility of

 its acquisition.

      The accuracy of workmanship essential to this development of me-
 chanical progress required very precise measurements of length, to which

 reference could be easily made. No such standards were then available

 for the workshops. But a little before 1830 a young workman named
 Joseph Whitworth realised that the basis of accuracy in machinery was the
 making of a true plane. The idea occurred to him that this could only
 be secured by making three independent plane surfaces ; if each of these
 would lift the other, they must be planes, and they must be true.

       The true plane rendered possible a degree of accuracy beyond the
 wildest dreams of his contemporaries in the construction of the lathe and
  the planing machine, which are used in the manufacture of all tools.

       His next step was to introduce an exact system of measurement,
  generally applicable in the workshop.

       Whitworth felt that the eye was altogether inadequate to secure this,
  and appealed to the sense of touch for affording a means of comparison.

  If two plugs be made to fit into a round hole, they may differ in size by a

  quantity imperceptible to the eye, or to any ordinary process of measure-
  ment, but in fitting them into the hole the difference between the larger
  and the smaller is felt immediately by the greater ease with which the
  smaller one fits. In this way a child can tell which is the larger of two
  cylinders differing in thickness by no more than 3770-0*^^ of an inch.

        Standard gauges, consisting of hollow cylinders -with plugs to fit, but
ADDRESS.  9

differing in diameter by the y^^^j^th or the tttJ ooth of an inch, were given
to his workmen, with the I'esult that a degree of accuracy inconceivable
to the ordinary mind became the rule of the shop.

     To render the consti-uction of accurate gauges possible Whitworth
devised his measuring machine, in which the movement was effected by a
screw ; by this means the distance between two true planes might be
measured to the one-millionth of an inch.

     These advances in precision of measurement have enabled the degree
of accuracy which was formerly limited to the mathematical-instrument

maker to become the common property of every machine shop. And not

only is the latest form of steam-engine, in the accuracy of its workman-

ship, little behind the chronometer of the early part of the century, but
the accuracy in the construction of experimental apparatus which has

thus been introduced lias rendered possible recent advances in many lines

of research.

     Lord Kelvin said in his Presidential Address at Edinburgh, ' Nearly
all the grandest discoveries of science have been but the rewards of accu-
rate measurement and patient, long-continued labour in the sifting of
numerical results.' The discovery of argon, for which Lord Rayleigh and
Professor Ramsay have been awarded the Hodgkin prize by the Smithsonian
Institution, affords a remarkable illustration of the truth of this remark.
Indeed, the provision of accurate standards not only of length, but of
weight, capacity, temperature, force, and energy, are amongst the founda-

tions of scientific investigation.

      In 1842 the British Association obtained the opportunity of extending

its usefulness in this direction.

     In that year the Government gave up the Royal Observatory at Kew,
and offered it to the Royal Society, who declined it. But the British
Association accepted the charge. Their first object was to continue
Sabine's valuable observations upon the vibrations of a pendulum in
various gases, and to promote pendulum observations in various parts of
the world. They subsequently extended it into an observatory for com-

paring and verifying the various instruments which recent discoveries in
physical science had suggested for continuous meteorological and magnetic
observations, for observations and experiments on atmospheric electricity,
and for the study of solar physics.

     This new departure afforded a means for ascertaining the advantages
and disadvantages of the several varieties of scientific instruments ; as well
as for standardising and testing instruments, not only for instrument-

makers, but especially for observers by whom simultaneous observations

 were then being carried on in different parts of tJie world; and also for
 training observers proceeding abroad on scientific expeditions.

      Its special object was to promote original research, and expenditure
 was not to be incurred on apparatus merely intended to exhibit the
necessary consequences of known laws.

      The rapid strides in electrical science had attracted attention to the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

 measurement of electrical resistances, and in 1859 the British Association
 appointed a special committee to devise a standard. The standard of
 resistance proposed by that committee became the generally accepted
 standard, until the requirements of that advancing science led to the
 adoption of an international standard.

      In 1866 the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade entered

into close relations with the Kew Observatory.
     And in 1871 Mr. Gassiot transferred 10,000?. upon trust to the Royal

 Society for the maintenance of the Kew Observatory, for the purpose of

 assisting in carrying on magnetical, meteorological, and other physical
 observations. The British Association thereupon, after having maintained
 this Observatory for nearly thirty years, at a total expenditure of about
 12,000?., handed the Observatory over to the Royal Society.

      The ' Transactions ' of the British Association are a catalogue of its
 efforts in every branch of science, both to promote experimental research
 and to facilitate the application of the results to the practical uses of

·life.

      But probably the marvellous development in science which has
 accompanied the life-history of the Association will be best appreciated
 by a brief allusion to the condition of some of the branches of science
 in 1831 as compared with their present state.

                       Geological and Geographical Science.

                                                                Geology.

      At the foundation of the Association geology Avas assuming a promi-

 nent position in science. The main features of English geology had been
 illustrated as far back as 1821, and, among the founders of the British
 Association, Murchison and Phillips, Buckland, Sedgwick and Cony-

 beare, Lyell and De la Beche, were occupied in investigating the data

 necessary for perfecting a geological chronology by the detailed observa-
 tions of the various British deposits, and by their co-relation with the

 Continental strata. They were thus preparing the way for those large

 generalisations which have raised geology to the rank of an inductive

  science.

      In 1831 the Ordnance maps published for the southern counties had
 enabled the Government to recognise the importance of a geological
 survey by the appointment of Mr. De la Beche to affix geological colours
 to the maps of Devonshire and portions of Somerset, Dorset and Cornwall
 and in 1835 Lyell, Buckland and Sedgwick induced the Government to
 establish the Geological Survey Department, not only for promoting
 geological science, but on account of its pi'actical bearing on agriculture,
 mining, the making of roads, railways and canals, and on other branches

  of national industry.
                                                                 1

                   Geography.

The Ordnance Survey appears to have had its origin in a proposal of

the French Government to make a joint-measurement of an arc of the

meridian. This proposal fell through at the outbreak of the Revolution ;
but the measurement of the base for that object was taken as a founda-

tion for a national survey. In 1831, however, the Ordnance Survey had

only published the 1-inch map for the southern portion of England, and

the great triangulation of the kingdom was still incomplete.

In 1834 the British Association urged upon the Government that the

advancement of various branches of science was greatly retarded by tlie

want of an accurate map of the whole of the British Isles ; and that,

consequently, the engineer and the meteorologist, the agriculturist and the

geologist, were each fettered in their scientific investigations by the

absence of those accurate data which now lie ready to his hand for the

measurement of length, of surface, and of altitude.

     Yet the first decade of the British Association was coincident with a
considerable development of geographical research. The Association was

persistent in pressing on the Government the scientific importance of

sending the expedition of Ross to the Antarctic and of Franklin to the

WeArctic regions.  may trust that we are approaching a solution of tlie

geography of the North Pole ; but the Antarctic regions still present a

field for the researches of the meteorologist, the geologist, the biologist,

and the magnetic observer, which the recent voyage of M. Borchgrevink

leads us to hope may not long remain unexplored.

In the same decade the question of an alternative route to India by

means of a communication between the Mediterranean and the Persian
Gulf was also receiving attention, and in 1835 the Government employed

Colonel Chesney to make a survey of the Euphrates valley in order to

ascertain whether that river would enable a practicable route to be formed

from Iskanderoon, or Tripoli, opposite Cyprus, to the Persian Gulf.

His valuable surveys are not, however, on a sufiiciently extensive scale to

enable an opinion to be formed as to whether a navigable waterway

through Asia Minor is physically practicable, or whether the cost of

establishing it might not be prohibitive.

The advances of Russia in Central Asia have made it imperative to

provide an easy, rapid, and alternative line of communication with our

Eastern possessions, so as not to be dependent upon the Suez Canal in

time of war. If a navigation cannot be established, a railway between

the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf has been shown by the recent

investigations of Messrs. Hawkshaw and Ilayter, following on those of

others, to be perfectly practicable and easy of accomplishment ; such an

undertaking would not only be of strategical value, but it is believed

it would be commercially remunerative.

Newcastle in 1863, their solution of the mystery of the Nile basin, which

had puzzled geographers from the days of Herodotus ; and the efforts
of Livingstone and Stanley and others have opened out to us the interior
of Africa. I cannot refrain here from expressing the deep regret which
geologists and geographers, and indeed all who are interested in the pro-
gress of discovery, feel at the recent death of Joseph Thomson. His

extensive, accurate, and trustworthy observations added much to our
knowledge of Africa, and by his premature death we have lost one of

its most competent explorers.

The report made to the Association on the state of the chemical

sciences in 1832, says that the efforts of investigators were then being

·directed to determining with accuracy the true nature of the substances

which compose the various products of the organic and inorganic king-

doms, and the exact ratios by weiglit which the different constituents of

these substances bear to each other.

But since that day the science of chemistry has far extended its

boundaries. The barrier has vanished which was supposed to separate

the products of living organisms from the substances of which minerals

consist, or which could be formed in the laboratory. The number of dis-

tinct carbon compounds obtainable from organisms has greatly increased
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but it is small when compared with the number of such compounds which

have been artificially formed. The methods of analysis have been per-

fected. The physical, and especially the optical, properties of the various

forms of matter have been closeh' studied, and many fruitful generalisa-

tions have been made. The form in which these generalisations would

now be stated may probably change, some, perhaps, by the overthrow or

disuse of an ingenious guess at Nature's workings, but more by that

--change which is the ordinary growth of science namely, inclusion in

some simpler and more general view.

In these advances the chemist has called the spectroscope to his aid.

Indeed, the existence of the British Association has been practically coter-

minous with the comparatively newly developed science of spectrum

analysis, for though Newton,' Wollaston, Fraunhofer, and Fox Talbot

had worked at the subject long ago, it was not till Kirchhoff and
Bunsen set a seal on the prior labours of Stokes, Angstrom, and Balfour

Stewart that the spectra of terrestrial elements have been mapped out and

grouped                                    that  by its  help  new elements have  been  discovered,  and  that
                                        ;

the idea has been suggested that the various orders of spectra of the same

     ' Joannes Marcus Marci, of Kroniand in Bohemia, was the only predecessor of

Newton who had any knowledge of the formation of a spectrum by a prism. He not

only observed that the coloured rays diverged as they left the prism, but that a

coloured ray did not change in colour after transmission through a prism. Plis book,

Thaumantias, liber do arcucailestl deque colornm apparentmrn natura, Prag, 16i8, was,

however, not known to Newton, and had no influence upon future discoveries.

     But great as have been the advances of terrestrial chemistry through
its assistance, the most stupendous advance which we owe to the spectro-

scope lies in the celestial direction.

r Astronomy.

At the third meeting of the Association, at Cambridge, in 1833, Dr.

Whewell said that astronomy is not only the queen of science, but the

only perfect science, which was ' in so elevated a state of flourishing

maturity that all that remained was to determine with the extreme of

accuracy the consequences of its rules by the profoundest combinations of

mathematics                                                      the magnitude of  its      data                                                          by  the  minutest scrupulousness
                                                     ;

of observation.' But in the previous year, Airy, in his report to

the Association on the progress of Astronomy, had pointed out that

the observations of the planet Uranus could not be united in one

elliptic orbit                                                   a  remark  which  turned       the                                                           attention  of  Adams   to the

discovery of Neptune.

In his report on the recent progress of Optics, Brewster in 1832

suggested that with the assistance of adequate instruments ' it would be

possible to study the action of the elements of material bodies upon rays

of artificial light, and thereby to discover the analogies between their

affinities and those which produce the fixed lines in the spectra of the

stars                    and  thus                                  to  study the  effects  of  the                                                           combustions    which  light  up
                      ;

the suns of other systems.'

This idea has now been realised. All the stars which shine brightly

enough to impress an image of the spectrum upon a photographic plate

have been classified on a chemical basis. The close connection between

stars and nebulte has                                                   been  demonstrated                                                                and  while  the    modern  science
                                                                                                                                                       ;

of thermodynamics has shown that the hypothesis of Kant and Laplace

on stellar formation, so far as it assumed a fiery cloud for the beginning,

is no longer tenable, but that in all probability it gives the true explana

tion of stellar evolution, if for the fiery cloud we substitute cold meteoric

particles, as suggested by Waterston ' and by Lord Kelvin ^ at the

Liverpool meeting of the British Association in 1854.

   We now know that the spectra of many of the terrestrial elements in

the chromosphere of the sun differ from those familiar to us in our labora-

Wetories.                     begin to glean the fact thai; the chromospheric spectra are

similar to those indicated by the absorption going on in the hottest stars, and
Lockyer has not hesitated to affirm that these facts would indicate that in

those localities we are in the presence of the actions of temperatures suffi-

ciently high to break up our chemical elements into finer forms. Other

students of these phenomena may not agree in this view, and pos-
sibly the discrepancies may be due to default in our terrestrial

chemistry. Still, I would recall to you that Dr. Carpenter, in his Presi-
dential Address at Brighton in 1872, almost censured the speculations of
Frankland and Lockyer in 1868 for attributing a certain bright line in
the spectrum of solar prominences (which was not identifiable with that

of any known terrestrial source of light) to a hypothetical new substance

which they proposed to call ' helium,' because ' it had not received that
verification which, in the case of Crookes' search for thallium, was afforded

by the actual discovery of the new metal.' Ramsay has now shown that
this gas is present in dense minerals on earth ; but we have now also

learned from Lockyer that it and other associated gases are not only
found with hydrogen in the solar chromosphere, but that these gases,
with hydrogen, form a large percentage of the atmospheric constituents of
some of the hottest stars in the heavens.

     The spectroscope has also made us acquainted with the motions and
even the velocities of those distant orbs which make up the sidereal uni-
verse. It has enabled us to determine that many stars, single to the eye,
are really double, and many of the conditions of these strange systems
have been revealed. The rate at which matter is moving in solar cyclones

and winds is now familiar to us. And I may also add that quite recently

this wonderful instrument has enabled Professor Keeler to verify Clerk-
Maxwell's theory that the rings of Saturn consist of a marvellous com-

--pany of separate moons as it were, a cohort of courtiers revolving round

--their queen with velocities proportioned to their distances from the

planet.

                                                         Physics

     If we turn to the sciences which are included under physics, the pro-

gress has been equally marked.
     In optical science, in 1831 the theory of emission as contrasted with

the undulatory theory of light was still under discussion.
     Young, who was the first to explain the phenomena due to the inter-

ference of the rays of light as a consequence of the theory of waves, and
Fresnel, who showed the intensity of light for any relative position of the
interference-waves, both had only recently passed away.

     The investigations into the laws which regulate the conduction and
radiation of heat, together with the doctrine of latent and of specific heat,
and the relations of vapour to air, had all tended to the conception of a
material heat, or caloric, communicated by an actual flow and emission.

     It was not till 1834 that improved thermometrical appliances had
enabled Forbes and Melloni to establish the polarisation of heat, and thus
to lay the foundation of an undulatory theory for heat similar to that
which was in progress of acceptation for light.

     Whewell's report, in 1832, on magnetism and electricity shows that
ADDRESS.  1K

these branches of science were looked upon as cognate, and that the theory
of two opposite electric fluids was generally accepted.

     In magnetism, the investigations of Hansteen, Gauss, and Weber in
Europe, and the observations made under the Imperial Academy of Russia

over the vast extent of that empire, had established the existence of mag-
netic poles, and had shown that magnetic disturbances were simultaneous

at all the stations of observation.

     At their third meeting the Association urged the Government to

establish magnetic and meteorological observatories in Great Britain and
her colonies and dependencies in different parts of the earth, furnished
with proper instruments, constructed on uniform principles, and with

provisions for continued observations at those places.
      In 1839 the British Association had a large share in inducing the

Government to initiate the valuable series of experiments for determining
the intensity, the declination, the dip, and the periodical variations of the
magnetic needle which were carried on for several years, at numerous
selected stations over the surface of the globe, under the directions of
Sabine and Lefroy.

     In England systematic and regular observations are still made at
Greenwich, Kew, and Stonyhurst. For some years past similar observa-
tions by both absolute and self-recording instruments have also been made

--at Falmouth close to the home of Robert Were Fox, whose name is in-

separably connected with the early history of terrestrial magnetism in

--this country but under such great financial difficulties that the continu-

ance of the work is seriously jeopardised. It is to be hoped that means

may be forthcoming to carry it on. Cornishmen, indeed, could found no
more fitting memorial of their distinguished countryman, John Couch

Adams, than by suitably endowing the magnetic observatory in which he
took so lively an interest.

     Far more extended observation will be needed before we can hope

Weto have an established theory as to the magnetism of the earth.

are without magnetic observations over a large part of the Southern

Hemisphere. And Professor Riicker's recent investigations tell us that

the earth seems as it were alive with magnetic forces, be they due to elec-
tric currents or to variations in the state of magnetised matter ; that the

disturbances affect not only the diurnal movement of the magnet, but
that even the small part of the secular change which has been observed,
and which has taken centuries to accomplish, is interfered with by some
slower agency. And, what is more important, he tells us that nime of
these observations stand as yet upon a firm basis, because standard instru-
ments have not been in accord ; and much labour, beyond the power of
individual effort, has hitherto been required to ascertain whether the
relations between them are constant or variable.

     In electricity, in 1831, just at the time when the British Association
was founded, Faraday's splendid researches in electricity and magnetism
at the Royal Institution had begun with his discovery of magneto-
16 REPORT-- 1895.

electi'ic induction, his investigation of the laws of electro-chemical decom-

position, and of the mode of electrolytical action.

But, the practical application of our electrical knowledge was then

limited to the use of lightning-conductors for buildings and ships.

Indeed, it may be said that the applications of electricity to the use of
man have grown up side by side with the British Association.

One of the first practical applications of Faraday's discoveries was in

the deposition of metals and electro-plating, v/hich has developed into a

large branch of  national  industry                                                   and  the dissociating  effect of  the

electric arc, for the reduction of ores, and in other processes, is daily

obtaining a wider extension.

But probably the application of electricity which is tending to pro-

duce the greatest change in our mental, and even material condition, is

the electric telegraph and its sister, the telephone. By their agency not

only do we learn, almost at the time of their occurrence, the events which

are happening in distant parts of the world, but they are establishing a

community of thought and feeling between all the nations of the world

which is influencing their attitude towards each other, and, we may hope,

may tend to weld them mere and more into one family.

The electric telegraph was introduced experimentally in Germany in

1833, two years after tlie formation of the Association. It was made a

commercial success by Cooke and Wheatstone in England, whose first

attempts at telegi'aphy were made on the line from Euston to Camden

Town in 1837, and on the line from Paddington to West Drayton in 1838.

The submarine telegraph to America, conceived in ] 856, became a

practical reality in 1861 through the commercial energy of Cyrus Field

and Pender, aided by the mechanical skill of Latimer Clark, Gooch, and

others, and the scienti6c genius of Lord Kelvin. The knowledge of

electricity gained by means of its application to the telegraph largely

assisted the extension of its utility in other directions.

The electric light gives, in its incandescent form, a very perfect

hygienic light. Where rivers are at hand the electrical transmission of

power will drive railway trains and factories economically, and might

enable each artisan to convert his room into a workshop, and thus assist

in restoring to the labouring man some of the individuality which the

factory has tended to destroy.

In 1843 Joule described his experiments for determining the mechani-

cal equivalent of heat. But it was not until the meeting at Oxford, in

1817, that he fully developed the law of the conservation of energy, which,

in conjunction with Newton's law of the conservation of momentum, and

Dalton's law of the conservation of chemical elements, constitutes a

complete mechanical foundation for physical science.

Who, at the foundation of the Association, would have believed some

far-seeing philosopher if he had foretold that the spectroscope would

analyse the constituents of the sun and measure the motions of the stars
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

that we should liquefy air and utilise temperatures approaching to the

absolute zero for experimental research ; that, like the magician in the

'Arabian Nights,' we should annihilate distance by means of the electric

telegraph and the telephone ; that we should illuminate our largest build-
ings instantaneously, with the clearness of day, by means of the electric

current ; that by the electric transmission of power we should be able to

utilise the Falls of Niagara to work factories at distant places ; that we

should extract metals from the crust of the earth by the same electrical

agency to which, in some cases, their deposition has been attributed 1

These discoveries and their applications have been brought to their

present condition by the researches of a long line of scientific explorers,

such as Dalton, Joule, Maxwell, Helmholtz, Herz, Kelvin, and Rayleigh,

aided by vast strides made in mechanical skill. But what will our

Howsuccessors be discussing sixty years hence ?  little do we yet know of

the vibrations which communicate light and heat ! Far as we have ad-

vanced in the application of electricity to the uses of life, we know but

Welittle even yet of its real nature.  are only on the threshold of the

knowledge of molecular action, or of the constitution of the all-pervading

sether. Newton, at the end of the seventeenth century, in his preface to

the ' Principia,' says : ' I have deduced the motions of the planets by

mathematical reasoning from forces ; and I would that we could derive
the other phenomena of Nature from mechanical principles by the same

mode of reasoning. For many things move me, so that I somewhat sus-

pect that all such may depend on certain forces by which the particles of

bodies, through causes not yet known, are either urged towards each other

according to regular figures, or ai'e repelled and recede from each other ·

and these forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto made their

attempts on Nature in vain.'

    In 184r8 Faraday remarked : ' How rapidly the knowledge of molecular

forces grows upon us, and how strikingly every investigation tends to

develop more and more their importance !

   A' few years ago magnetism was an occult force, affecting only a few

bodies ; now it is found to influence all bodies, and to possess the most

intimate relation with electricity, heat, chemical action, light, crystallisa-

tion ; and through it the forces concerned in cohesion. "We may feel

encouraged to continuous labours, hoping to bring it into a bond of union

with gravity itself.'

But it is only within the last few years that we have begun to realise

that electricity is closely connected with the vibrations which cause heat

--and light, and which seem to pei'vade all space vibrations which may be

termed the voice of the Creator calling to each atom and to each cell of

protoplasm to fall into its ordained position, each, as it were, a musical

note in the harmonious symphony which we call the universe.

--18 REPORT 1895.

                                          Jleteorology.

At the first meeting, in 1831, Professor James D. Forbes was requested

to draw up a report on the State of IMeteorological Science, on the ground
that this science is more in want than any other of that systematic direc-

tion which it is one great object of tlie Association to give.

    Professor Forbes made his first report in 1832, and a subsequent
report in 1840. The systematic records now kept in various pai'ts of the

world of barometric pressure, of solar heat, of the temperature and pliysi-

cal conditions of the atmosphere at various altitudes, of the heat of the

ground at various depths, of the rainfall, of the prevalence of winds, and

the gradual elucidation not only of the laws which regulate the movements

of cyclones and storms, but of the influences which are exercised by the

sun and by electricity and magnetism, not only upon atmospheric condi-

tions, but upon health and vitality, are gradually approximating meteor-

ology to the position of an exact science.

England took the lead in rainfall observations. Mr. G. J. Symons

organised the British Rainfall System in 1860 with 178 observers, a

system which until 1876 received the help of the British Association.

Now Mr. Symons himself conducts it, assisted by more than 3,000 observers,

and these volunteers not only make the oljservations, but defray the ex-

pense of their reduction and publication. In foreign countries this work

is done by Government officers at the public cost.

At the present time a very large number of rain gauges are in daily

use throughout the world. The British Islands have moi-e than 3,000,

and India and the United States have nearly as many ; France and

--Germany are not

                                       ;

colony alone, New South Wales, has more than 1,100.

The storm warnings now issued under the excellent systematic organi-

sation of the Meteorological Committee may be said to have had their

origin in the terrible storm which broke over the Black Sea during the

Crimean War, on November 27, 1855. Leverrier traced the progress of

-that storm, and seeing how its path could have been reported in advance

by the electric telegraph, he proposed to establish observing .stations which

should report to the coasts the probability of the occurrence of a storm.

Leverrier communicated with Airy, and the Government authorised Ad-

miral FitzHoy to make tentative arrangements in this country. The idea

was also adopted on the Continent, and now there are few civilised coun-

ti'ies north or south of the equator without a system of storm warning.'

     ' It has often been supposed that Leverrier was also the first to issue a daily
weather map, but that was not the case, for in the Great Exhibition of 1851 the
Electric Telegraph Company sold daily weather maps, copies of which are still in
existence, and the data for them were, it is believed, obtained by Mr, James
Glaisher, F.R.S., at that time Superintendent of the Meteorological Department at

Greenwich.
ADDRESS.  19

                                          Biological Science.

                                                                BotanTj.

     The earliest Rej)orts of the Association which bear on the biological
sciences were those I'elating to botany.

     In 1831 the controversy was yet unsettled between the advantages
of the Linnean, or Artificial system, as contx-asted with the Natural
system of classification. Histology, morphology, and physiological botany,
even if born, were in their early infancy.

     Our records show that von Mohl noted cell division in 1835, the
presence of chlorophyll corpuscles in 1837 ; and he first described

pi'otoplasm in 1846.

     Vast as have been the advances of physiological botany since that

time, much of its fundamental principles remain to be worked out, and I

trust that the establishment, for the iirst time, of a permanent Section for
botany at the present meeting will lead the Association to take a more
prominent part than it has hitherto done in the further development of
this branch of biological science.

                                        Animal Physiology.

     In 1831 Cuvier, who during the previous generation had, by the colla-

tion of facts followed by careful inductive reasoning, established the
plan on which each animal is constructed, was approaching the termina-

tion of his long and useful life. He died in 1832 ; but in 1831 Richard

Owen was just commencing his anatomical investigations and his brilliant

contributions to paleontology.

     The impulse which their labours gave to biological science was

reflected in numerous reports and communications, by Owen and others,

throughout the early decades of the British Association, until Darwin
propounded a theory of evolution which commanded the general assent of
the scientific world. For this theory was not absolutely new. But just
as Cuvier had shown that each bone in the fabric of an animal affords a
clue to the shape and structure of the animal, so Darwin brought harmony
into scattered facts, and led us to perceive that the moulding hand of the

Creator may have evolved the complicated structures of the organic

world from one or moi'e primeval cells.

    Richard Owen did not accept Darwin's theory of evolution, and a

large section of the public contested it. I well remember the storm it

--produced a storm of praise by my geological colleagues, who accepted

the result of investigated facts ; a storm of indignation such as that which

would have burned Galileo at the stake from those who were not yet

prepared to question the old authorities ; but they diminish daily.

   We are, however, as yet only on the threshold of the doctrine of

evolution. Does not each fresh investigation, even into the embryonic
stage of the simpler forms of life, suggest fresh problems 1

     The impulse given by Darwin has been fruitful in leading others to
consider whether the same principle of evolution may not have governed
the moral as well as tiie material progress of the human race. Mr. Kidd
tells us that nature as interpreted by the struggle for life contains no
sanction for the moral progress of the individual, and points out that if
each of us were allowed by the conditions of life to follow his own inclina-
tion, the average of each generation would distinctly deteriorate from that
of the preceding one ; but because the law of life is ceaseless and inevit-
able struggle and competition, ceaseless and inevitable selection and re-
jection, the result is necessarily ceaseless and inevitable progress. Evolu-
tion, as Sir William Flower said, is the message which biology has sent
to help us on with some of the problems of human life, and Francis
Galton urges that man, the foremost outcome of the awful mystery of
evolution, should realise that he has the power of shaping the course of
future humanity by using his intelligence to discover and expedite the

changes which are necessary to adapt circumstances to man, and man to

circumstances.

     In considering the evolution of the human race, the science of pre-
ventive medicine may afford us some indication of the direction in which to
seek for social improvement. One of the early steps towards establish-
 ing that science upon a secure basis was taken in 1835 by the British
 Association, who urged upon the Government the necessity of establishing

 legisters of mortality showing the causes of death ' on one uniform plan in
 all parts of the King's dominions, as the only means by which general laws
 touching the influence of causes of disease and death could be satisfactorily
 deduced.' The general registration of births and deaths was commenced
 in 1838. But a mere record of death and its proximate cause is insuffi-
 cient. Pi-eventive medicine requires a knowledge of the details of the
 ]-revious conditions of life and of occupation. Moreover, death is not
 <;ur only or most dangerous enemy, and the main object of preventive
 medicine is to ward off disease. Disease of body lowers our useful energy.

 Disease of body or of mind may stamp its curse on succeeding generations.
       The anthropometric laboratory affords to the student of anthropo-

 logy a means of analysing the causes of weakness, not only in bodily,
  but also in mental life.

       Mental actions are indicated by movements and their results. Such
 signs are capable of record, and modern physiology has shown that bodily
  movements correspond to action in nerve-centres, as surely as the motions
  of the telegraph-indicator express the movements of the operator's hands

  in the distant ofiBce.

       Thus there is a relation between a defective status in brain power and

  defects in the proportioning of the body. Defects in physiognomical

  details, too finely graded to be measured with instruments, may be

  appreciated with accuracy by the senses of the observer j and the records

sliow that these defects are, in a large degree, associated with a brain
status lower than the average in mental power.

   A report presented by one of your committees gives the results of

observations made on 100,000 school-children examined individually in
order to determine their mental and physical condition for the purpose of

classification. This shows that about 16 per 1,000 of the elementary
school population appear to be so far defective in their bodily or brain
condition as to need special training to enable them to undertake the
duties of life, and to keep them from pauperism or crime.

    Many of our feeble-minded children, and much disease and vice, are

the outcome of inherited proclivities. Francis Galton has shown us that
types of criminals which have been bred true to their kind are one of the
saddest disfigurements of modern civilisation ; and he says that few deserve
better of their country than those who determine to lead celibate lives
through a reasonable conviction that their issue would probably be less
fitted than the generality to play their part as citizens.

      These considerations point to the importance of preventing those
suffering from transmissible disease, or the criminal, or the lunatic, from

adding fresh sufferers to the teeming misery in our large towns. And in

any case, knowing as we do the influence of environment on the develop-
ment of individuals, they point to the necessity of removing those who are

born with feeble minds, or under conditions of moral clanger, from sur-
rounding deteriorating influences.

     These are problems which materially affect the progress of the human
race, and we may feel sure that, as we gradually approach their solution,
we shall more certainly realise that the theory of evolution, which the
genius of Darwin impressed on this century, is but the first step on a
biological ladder which may possibly eventually lead us to understand
how in the drama of creation man has been evolved as the highest work

of the Creator.
                                                          Bacteriology.

     The sciences of medicine and surgery were largely represented in the

earlier meetings of the Association, before the creation of the British
JNIedical Association afforded a field for their more intimate discussion.

The close connection between the different branches of science is causing
a revival in our proceedings of discussions on some of the highest medical
problems, especially those relating to the spread of infectious and epidemic

 disease.

       It is interesting to contrast the opinion prevalent at the foundation of
 the Association with the present position of the question.

    A report to the Association in 1834, by Professor Henry, on contagion,

 says :

      ' The notion that contagious emanations are at all connected with the
 diffusion of animalculte through the atmosphere is at variance with all
 that is known of the diffusion of volatile contagion.'

     Whilst it had long been known that filthy conditions in air, earth

and water fostei'ed fever, cholera, and many other forms of disease,

and that the disease ceased to spread on the removal of these con-
ditions, yet the reason for their propagation or diminution remained under
a veil.

     Leeuwenhoek in 1680 described the yeast-cells, but Schwann in 1837
first showed clearly that fermentation was due to the activity of the yeast-
cells ; and, although vague ideas of fermentation had been current during
the past century, he laid the foundation of our exact knowledge of the
nature of tlie action of ferments, both organised and unorganised. It
was not until 1860, after the prize of the Academy of Sciences had
been awarded to Pasteur for his essay against the theory of spon-

taneous generation, that his investigations into the action of ferments

enabled him to show that tlie effects of the yeast-cell are indissolubly
bound up with the activities of the cell as a living organism, and that
certain diseases, at least, are due to the action of ferments in the
living being. In 1865 he showed that the disease of silkworms, which
was then undermining the silk industry in France, could be successfully
combated. His further researches into anthrax, fowl cholera, swine fever,
rabies, and other diseases proved the theory that those diseases are con-
nected in some way with the introduction of a microbe into the body of
an animal ; that the virulence of the poison can be diminished by culti-
vating the microbes in an appropriate manner ; and that when the virulence
has been thus diminished their inoculation will afford a protection against

the disease.

      Meanwhile it had often been observed in hospital practice that a patient
with a simple-fractured limb was easily cured, whilst a patient with a
compound fracture often died from the wound. Lister was thence led, in
1865, to adopt his antiseptic treatment, by which the wound is protected
from hostile microbes.

      These investigations, followed by the discovery of the existence of a
multitude of micro-organisms and the recognition of some of them

--such as the bacillus of tubercle and the comma bacillus of cholera as

essential factors of disease ; and by the elaboration by Koch and others
of methods by which the several organisms might be isolated, cultivated,
 and their histories studied, have gradually built up the science of bac-
teriology. Amongst later developments ai'e the discovery of various
 so-called antitoxins, such as those of diphtheria and tetanus, and the

 utilisation of these for the cure of disease. Lister's treatment formed a
 landmark in the science of surgery, and enabled our surgeons to perform
 operations never before dreamed of ; whilst later discoveries are tending

to place the practice of medicine on a firm scientific basis. And the

science of bacteriology is leading us to recur to stringent rules for the

isolation of infectious disease, and to the disinfection (by superheated steam)

of materials which have been in contact with the sufferer.

These microbes, whether friendly or hostile, are all capable of multi-

plying at an enormous rate under favourable conditions. They are found

in the air, in water, in the soil ; but, fortunately, the presence of one species
appears to be detrimental to other species, and sunshine, or even light

from the sky, is prejudicial to most of them. Our bodies, when in health,

appear to be furnished with special means of resisting attacks, and, so

far as regards their influence in causing disease, the success of the attack

of a pathogenic organism upon an individual depends, as a rule, in part

at least, upon the power of resistance of the individual.

But notwithstanding our knowledge of the danger arising from a

state of low health in individuals, and of the universal prevalence of

these micro-organisms, how careless we are in guarding the health

Weconditions of everyday life !  have ascertained that pathogenic

organisms pervade the air. Why, therefore, do we allow our meat,

our fish, our vegetables, our easily contaminated milk, to be exposed

Weto their inroads, often in the foulest localities ?      have ascertained

that they pervade the water we drink, yet we allow foul water from our

dwellings, our pigsties, our farmyards, to pass into ditches without

previous clarification, whence it flows into our streams and pollutes our

Werivers.  know the conditions of occupation which foster ill-health.

Why, whilst we remove outside sources of impure air, do we permit the

occupation of foul and unhealthy dwellings 1

     The study of bacteriology has shown us that although some of these
organisms may be the accompaniments of disease, yet we owe it to the

operation of others that the refuse caused by the cessation of aniinal and

vegetable life is reconverted into food for fresh generations of plants and

animals.

These considerations have foi'med a point of meeting where the

biologist, the chemist, the physicist, and the statistician unite with the

sanitary engineer in the application of the science of preventive medicine.

                                                Engineering.

                                                 Seicage Purification.

     The early reports to the Association show that the laws of hydro-
statics, hydrodynamics, and hydraulics necessary to the supply and removal
of water through pipes and conduits had long been investigated by the
mathematician. But the modern sanitary engineer has been driven by
the needs of an increasing population to call in the chemist and the
biologist to help him to provide pure water and pure air.

     The purification and the utilisation of sewage occupied the attention of
the British Association as early as 1864, and between 1869 and 187G a
committee of the Association made a series of valuable reports on the
subject. The direct application of sewage to land, though efiective as a
24. REPORT-- 1895.

means of purification, entailed difficulties in thickly settled districts, owing

to the extent of land required.

The cliemical treatment of sewage produced an effluent harmless only

after having been passed over land, or if turned into a large and rapid

stream, or into a tidal estuary ; and it left behind a large amount of

sludge to be dealt with.

Hence it was long contended that the simplest plan in favourable

localities was to turn the sewage into the sea, and that the consequent

loss to the land of the manurial value in the sewage would be recouped by

the increase in fish-life.

It was not till the chemist called to his aid the biologist, and came to

the help of the engineer, that a scientific system of sewage purification

Avas evolved.

Dr. Frankland many years ago suggested the intermittent filtration of

sewage                               and Mr.  Bailey Denton and Mr.  Baldwin Latham were the  first
                                  ;

engineers to adopt it. But the valuable experiments made in recent

years by the State Board of Health in Massachusetts have more clearly

explained to us how by this system we may utilise micro-organisms to con-

vert organic impurity in sewage into food fitted for higher forms of life.

     To effect this we require, in the first place, a filter about five feet thick

of sand and gravel, or, indeed, of any material which affords numerous

surfaces or open pores. Secondly, that after a volume of sewage has

passed through the filter, an interval of time be allowed, in which the air

necessary to support the life of the micro-organisms is enabled to enter

the pores of the filter. Thus this system is dependent upon oxygen and
time. Under such conditions the organisms necessary for purification are

sure to establish themselves in the filter before it has been long in use.

Temperature is a secondary consideration.

     Imperfect purification can invariably be traced either to a lack of
oxygen in the pores of the filter, or to the sewage passing through so

quickly that there is not sufficient time for the necessary processes to

take place. And the power of any material to purify either sewage or

water depends almost entirely upon its ability to hold a sufficient propor-

tion of either sewage or water in contact with a proper amount of air.

                                          Smoke Abatement.

     Whilst the sanitary engineer has done much to improve the surface

conditions of our towns, to furnish clean water, and to remove our
sewage, he has as yet done little to purify town air. Fog is caused by the
floating particles of matter in the air becoming weighted with aqueous
vapour ; some particles, such as salts of ammonia or chloride of sodium,

have a greater affinity for moisture than others. You will suffer from

fog so long as you keep refuse stored in your towns to furnish ammonia,

or so long as you allow your street surfaces to supply dust, of which much

consists of powdered horse manure, or so long as you send the products of
ADDRESS.  2r

combustion into the atmosphere. Therefore, when you have adopted
mechanical traction for your vehicles in towns you may largely reduce

one cause of fog. And if you diminish your black smoke, you will

diminish black fogs.

     In manufactories you may prevent smoke either by care in firing,

by using smokeless coal, or by washing the soot out of the products of
consumption in its passage along the flue leading to the main chimney-

shaft.

     The black smoke from your kitchen may be avoided by the use of coke
or of gas. But so long as we retain the hygienic arrangement of the

open fire in our living-rooms I despair of finding a fireplace, however well
constructed, which will not be used in such a manner as to cause smoke,
unless, indeed, the chimneys were reversed and the fumes drawn into
some central shaft, where they might be washed before being passed into

the atmosphei'e.

     Electricity as a warming and cooking agent would be convenient,
cleanly, and economical when generated by water power, or possibly wind
power, but it is at present too dear when it has to be generated by means
of coal. I can conceive, however, that our descendants may learn so to

utilise electricity that they in some future century may be enabled by its

means to avoid the smoke in their towns.

                                          Ileclianical Engineering.

     In other branches of civil and mechanical engineering, the reports in
1831 and 1832 on the state of this science show that the theoretical and
practical knowledge of the strength of timber had obtained considerable
development. But in 1830, before the introduction of railways, cast iron
had been sparingly used in arched bridges for spans of from 160 to 200
feet, and wrought iron had only been applied to large-span iron bridges on
the suspension principle, the most notable instance of which was the Menai
Suspension Bridge, by Telford. Indeed, whilst the strength of timber had
been patiently investigated by engineers, the best form for the use of iron
girders and struts was only beginning to attract attention, and the earlier
volumes of our Proceedings contained numerous records of the researches
of Eaton Hodgkinson, Barlow, Rennie, and others. It was not until
twenty years later that Robert Stephenson and William Fairbairn erected
the tubular bridge at Menai, followed by the more scientific bridge erected

by Brunei at Saltash. These have now been entirely eclipsed by the skill

with which the estuary of the Forth has been bridged with a span of
1,700 feet by Sir John Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker.

     The development of the iron industry is due to the association of the
chemist with the engineer. The introduction of the hot blast by Neilson,
in 1829, in the manufacture of cast iron had effected a large saving of fuel.
But the chemical conditions which afiect the strength and other qualities
of iron, and its combinations with carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and other
substance?, had at that time scarcely been investigated.
26 REPORT--1895.

     In 1856 Bessemer brought before the British Association at Cheltenham
his brilliant discovery for making steel direct from the blast furnace,
by which he dispensed with the laborious process of first removing the
carbon from pig-iron by puddling, and then adding by cementation the

required proportion of carbon to make steel. This discovery, followed
by Siemens's regenerative furnace, by Whitworth's compressed steel, and
by the use of alloys and by other improvements too numerous to

mention here, have revolutionised the conditions under which metals are
applied to engineering purposes.

     Indeed, few questions are of greater interest, or possess more industrial
impor'tance, than those connected with metallic alloys. This is especially
true of those alloys which contain the rarer metals ; and the extraordinary
effects of small quantities of chromium, nickel, tungsten and titanium on
certain varieties of steel have exerted profound influence on the manu-
facture of projectiles and on the construction of our armoured ships.

      Of lateyears, investigations on the properties and structure uf alloys have

been numerous, and among the more noteworthy researches may be men-
tioned those of Dewar and Fleming on the distinctive behaviour, as regards

the thermo-electric powers and electrical resistance, of metals and alloys at

the very low temperatures which may be obtained by the use of liquid air.

      Professor Roberts-Austen, on the other hand, has carefully studied
the behaviour of alloys at very high temperatures, and by employing his
delicate pyrometer has obtained photographic curves which afford addi-
tional evidence as to the existence of allotropic modifications of metals,
and which have materially strengthened the view that alloys are closely

analogous to saline solutions. In this connection it may be stated that

the very accurate work of Heycock and Neville on the lowering of the
solidifying points of molten metals, which is caused by the presence of
other metals, affords a valuable contribution to our knowledge.

      Professor Boberts-Austen has, moreover, shown that the effect of any
one constituent of an alloy upon the properties of the principal metal has
a direct relation to the atomic volumes, and that it is consequently possible
to foretell, in a great measure, the effect of any given combination.

   A new branch of investigation, which deals with the micro-structure

of metals and alloys, is rapidly assuming much importance. It was
instituted by Sorby in a communication which he made to the Bi'itisli
Association in 1864, and its development is due to many patient workers,
among whom M. Osmond occupies a prominent place.

      Metallurgical science has brought aluminium into use by cheapening
the process of its extraction ; and if by means of the wasted forces in our
rivers, or possibly of the wind, the extraction be still further cheapened

by the aid of electricity, we may not only utilise the metal or its alloys in

increasing the spans of our bridges, and in affording strength and lightness

in the construction of our ships, but we may hope to obtain a material
which may render practicable the dreams of Icarus and of Maxim, and for

purposes of rapid transit enable us to navigate the air.
              ADDRESS.                                                                      27

Long before 1831 the steam-engine had been largely used on rivers and

lakes, and for short sea passages, although the first Atlantic steam-service

was not established till 1838.

    As early as 1820 the steam-engine had been applied by Gurney, Han-

cock, and others to road traction. The absurd impediments placed in their
way by road trustees, which, indeed, are still enforced, checked any progress.
But the question of mechanical traction on ordinary roads was practically

shelved in 1830, at the time of the formation of the British Association,

when the locomotive engine was combined with a tubular boiler and an

iron road on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.
     Great, however, as was the advance made by the locomotive engine of

Robert Stephenson, these earlier engines were only toys compared with

the compound engines of to-day which are used for railways, for ships, or
for the manufacture of electricity. Indeed, it may be said that the study
of the laws of heat, which have led to the introduction of various forms of

motive power, are gradually revolutionising all our habits of life.

     The improvements in the production of iron, combined with the de-
veloped steam-engine, have completely altered the conditions of our com-
mercial intercourse on land ; whilst the changes caused by the effects of

these improvements in shipbuilding, and on the ocean carrying trade,

have been, if anything, still more marked.

At the foundation of the Association all ocean ships were built by

hand, of  wood, propelled by sails and manoeuvred by manual  labour                         the
                                                                                         ;

material limited their length, which did not often exceed 100 feet, and

the number of English ships of over 500 tons burden was comparatively

small.

     In the modern ships steam power takes the place of manual labour.
It rolls the plates of which the ship is constructed, bends them to the
required shape, cuts, drills and rivets them in their place. It weighs the
anchor ; it propels the ship in spite of winds or currents ; it steers, venti-
lates, and lights the ship when on the ocean. It takes the cargo on board

and discharges it on arrival.
     The use of iron favours the construction of ships of a large size, of forms

which afford small resistance to the water, and with compartments which

make the ships practically unsinkable in heavy seas, or by collision. Their
size, the economy with which they are propelled, and the certainty of their

arrival, cheapen the cost of transport.
     The steam-engine, by compressing air, gives us control over the tem-

perature of cool chambers. In these not only fresh meat, but the delicate
produce of the Antipodes, is brought across the ocean to our dooi's without

deterioration.

    Whilst railways have done much to alter the social conditions of each

individual nation, the application of iron and steam to our ships is revolu-
tionising the international commercial conditions of the world ; and it is
gradually changing the course of our agriculture, as well as of our do-

mestic life.
--23 REPORT 1895.

     But great as have been the developments of science in promoting the
commerce of the world, science is asserting its supremacy even to a greater

extent in every department of war. And perhaps this application of science

affords at a glance, better than almost any other, a convenient illustration

of the assistance which the chemical, physical, and electrical sciences are

affording to the engineer.

     The reception of warlike stores is not now left to the uncertain
judgment of ' practical men,' but is confided to officers who have receiv^ed

a special training in chemical analysis, and in the application of physical

and electrical science to the tests by which the qualities of explosives, of

guns, and of projectiles can be ascertained.

For instance, take explosives. Till quite recently black and brown

powders alone were used, the former as old as civilisation, the latter but

a small modern improvement adapted to the increased size of guns. But
now the whole family of nitro-explosives are rapidly superseding the old

powder.  These  are the direct outcome of chemical knowledge                                                                                                                                                                           they are
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

not mere chance inventions, for every improvement is based on chemical

theories, and not on random experiment.

The construction of guns is no longer a haphazard operation. In spite

of the enormous forces to be controlled and the sudden violence of their

action, the researches of the mathematician have enabled the just propor-

tions to be determined  with  accuracy                                            the labours of  the physicist                                                                                                                        have
                                                                               ;

revealed the internal conditions of the materials employed, and the best

means of their favourable employment. Take, for example, Longridge's

coiled-wire system, in which each successive layer of which tlie gun is
formed receives the exact proportion of tension which enables all the layers

to act in unison. The chemist has rendered it clear that even the smallest

quantities of certain ingredients are of supreme importance in affecting

the tenacity and trustworthiness of the materials.

The treatment of steel to adapt it to the vast range of duties it has

to pei'form is thus the outcome of patient research. And the use of

-- --the metals manganese, chromium, nickel, molybdenum as alloys with

iron has resulted in the production of steels possessing varied and extra-

ordinary properties. The steel required to resist the conjugate stresses

developed, lightning fashion, in a gun necessitates qualities that would not
be suitable in the projectile which that gun hurls with a velocity of some

2,-500 feet per second against the armoured side of a ship. The armour,

again, has to combine extreme superficial hardness with great toughness,
and during the last few years these qualities are sought to be attained by

the application of the cementation process for adding carbon to one face

of the plate, and hardening that face alone by rapid refrigeration.
     The introduction of quick-firing guns from -303 (i.e. about one-third)

of an inch to 6 -inch calibre has rendered necessary the production of metal

cartridge-cases of complex forms di-awn cold out of solid blocks or plate

of the material ; this again has taxed the ingenuity of the mechanic in the

device of machinery, and of the metallurgist in producing a metal possessed
ADDRESS.  29

of the necessary ductility and toughness. The cases have to stand a
pressure at the moment of firing of as much as twenty-five tons to the

--square inch a pressure which exceeds the ordinary elastic limits of the

steel of which the gun itself is composed.
     There is nothing more wonderful in practical mechanics than the

closing of the breech openings of guns, for not only must they be gas-
ti«^ht at these tremendous pressures, but the mechanism must be such

that one man by a single continuous movement shall be able to open or

close the breech of the largest gun in some ten or fifteen seconds.
     The perfect knowledge of the recoil of guns has enabled the reaction

of the discharge to be utilised in compressing air or springs by which guns
can be raised from concealed positions in order to deliver their fire, and
then made to disappear again for loading ; or the same force has been used
to run up the guns automatically immediately after firing, or, as in the

case of the Maxim gun, to deliver in the same way a continuous stream

of bullets at the rate of ten in one second.
     In the manufacture of shot and shell cast iron has been almost super-

seded by cast and wrought steel, though the hardened Palliser projectiles
still hold their place. The forged-steel projectiles are produced by methods
very similar to those used in the manufacture of metal cartridge-cases,

though the process is carried on at a red heat and by machines much more

powerful.

      In every department concerned in the production of warlike stores
electricity is playing a more and more important part. It has enabled
the passage of a shot to be followed from its seat in the gun to its

destination.

     In the gun, by means of electrical contacts arranged in the bore, a time-

curve of the passage of the shot can be determined.

     From this the mathematician constructs the velocity-curve, and
from this, again, the pressures producing the velocity are estimated, and
used to check the same indications obtained by other means. The velocity
of the shot after it has left the gun is easily ascertained by the Boulange

 apparatus.

      Electricity and photography have been laid under contribution for
obtaining records of the flight of projectiles and the effects of explosions

at the moment of their occurrence. Many of you will recollect Mr. Vernon

 Boys' marvellous photographs showing the progress of the shot driving

 before it waves of air in its course.
      Electricity and photography also record the properties of metals and

 their alloys as determined by curves of cooling.
      The readiness with which electrical energy can be converted into heat

 or light has been taken advantage of for the firing of guns, which in their
 turn can, by the same agency, be laid on the object by means of range-
 finders placed at a distance and in advantageous and safe positions ; while

 the electric light is utilised to illumine the sights at night, as well as to

 search out the objects of attack.
30 EEPORT-- 1895.

     The compact nature of the glow-lamp, the brightness of the light, the
circumstance that the light is not due to combustion, and therefore inde-
pendent of air, facilitates the examination of the bore of guns, the ii^sides

--of shells, and other similar uses just as it is used by a doctor to

examine the throat of a patient.

Influence of Intercommunication afforded by British Association
                                       ON Science Progress.

The advances in engineering which have produced the steam-engine,

the railway, the telegraph, as well as our engines of war, may be said to

be the result of commercial enterprise rendered possible only by the

advances which have taken place in the several branches of science

since 1831. Having regard to the intimate relations which the several

sciences bear to each other, it is abundantly clear that much of this pro-

gress could not have taken place in the past, nor could further progress

take place in the future, without intercommunication between the

students of different branches of science.

The founders of the British Association based its claims to utility

upon the power it afforded for this intercommunication. Mr. Vernon

Harcourt (the uncle of your present General Secretary), in the address he

delivered in 1832, said : 'How feeble is man for any purpose when he

--stands alone how strong when united with other men !

    ' It may be true that the greatest philosophical works have been

achieved in privacy, but it is no less true that these works would never

have been accomplished had the authors not mingled with men of corre-

sponding pursuits, and from the commerce of ideas often gathered germs

of apparently insulated discoveries, and without such material aid would

seldom have carried their investigations to a valuable conclusion.'

I claim for the British Association that it has fulfilled the objects of

its founders, that it has had a large share in promoting intercommunication

and combination.

Our meetings have been successful because they have maintained the

Wetrue principles of scientific investigation.  have been able to secure

the continued presence and concurrence of the master-spirits of science.
They have been willing to sacrifice their leisure, and to promote the

welfare of the Association, because the meetings have afibrded them the
means of advancing the sciences to which they are attached.

The Association has, moreover, justified the views of its founders in

promoting intercourse between the pursuers of science, both at home and

abroad, in a manner which is afforded by no other agency.

     The weekly and sessional reunions of the Royal Society, and the
annual soirees of other scientific societies, promote this intercourse to
some extent, but the British Association presents to the young student

during its week of meetings easy and continuous social opportunities for
                             ADDRESS.                   31

making the acquaintance of leaders in science, and thereby obtaining

their directing influence.
     It thus encourages, in the first place, opportunities of combination,

but, what is equally important, it gives at the same time material assist-

ance to the investigators whom it thus brings together.

     The reports on the state of science at the present time, as they appear
in the last volume of our Proceedings, occupy the same important position,
as records of science progress, as that occupied by those Reports in our
earlier years. "VVe exhibit no symptom of decay.

Science in Germany fostered by the State and Municipalities.

Our neighbours and rivals rely largely upon the guidance of the State

for the promotion of both science teaching and of research. In Germany

the foundations of technical and industrial training are laid in the Real-

schulen, and supplemented by the Higher Technical Schools. In Berlin

that splendid institution, the Royal Technical High School, casts into
the shade the facilities for education in the various Polytechnics which we

are now establishing in London. Moreover, it assists the practical work-

man by a branch department, which is available to the public for testing

building materials, metals, paper, oil, and other matters. The standards

of all weights and measures used in trade can be purchased from or tested

by the Government Department for Weights and Measures.

For developing pure scientific research and for promoting new applica-

tions of science to industrial purposes the German Government, at the

instance of von Helmholtz, and aided by the munificence of Werner

von Siemens, created the Physikalische Technische Reichsanstalt at

Charlottenburg.

This establishment consists of two divisions. The first is charged

with pure research, and is at the present time engaged in various thermal,

optical, and electrical and other physical investigations. The second

branch is employed in operations of delicate standardising to assist the

--wants of research students for instance, dilatation, electrical resistances,

electric and other forms of light, pressure gauges, recording instruments,

thermometers, pyrometers, tuning forks, glass, oil-testing apparatus,

viscosity of glycerine, &c.

Dr. Kohlrausch succeeded Helmholtz as president, and takes charge

of the first division. Professor Hagen, the director under him, has

Acharge of the second division.  professor is in charge of each of the

several sub-departments. Under these are various subordinate posts, held

by younger men, selected for previous valuable work, and usually for a

limited time.

     The general supervision is under a Council consisting of a president,
who is a Privy Councillor, and twenty-four members, including the
president and director of the Reichsanstalt ; of the other members, about
ten are professors or heads of physical and astronomical observatories
32 REPORT-- 1895.

connected with the principal universities in Germany. Three are selected
from leading firms in Germany representing mechanical, optical, and
electric science, and the remainder are principal scientific officials con-

nected with the Departments of War and Marine, the Eoyal Observatory

at Potsdam, and the Royal Commission for Weights and Measures.

     This Council meets in the winter, for such time as may be necessary,

for examining the research work done in the first division during the
previous year, and for laying down the scheme for research for the ensuing
year ; as well as for suggesting any requisite improvements in the second

division. As a consequence of the position which science occupies in

connection with the State in Continental countries, the services of those

who have distinguished tliemselves either in tlie advancement or in the

application of science are recognised by the award of honours ; and thus
the feeling for science is encouraged throughout the nation.

     Assistance to Scientific Research in Great Britain.

     Great Britain maintained for a long time a leading position among

the nations of the world by virtue of the excellence and accuracy of

its  workmanship,   the result of individual energy                                                                                                                        but the progress                     of
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

mechanical science has made accuracy of workmanship the common

property of all nations of the world. Our records show that hitherto, in

its efibrts to maintain its position by the application of science and the

prosecution of research, England has made marvellous advances by means

of voluntary efibrt, illustrated by the splendid munificence of such men

as Gassiot, Joseph  Whitworth, James  Mason,  and                                                                                                                          Ludwig  Mond                         and,
                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

whilst the increasing field of scientific research compels us occasionally

to seek for Government assistance, it would be unfortunate if by any

change voluntary efibrt were fettered by State control.

     The following are the principal voluntary agencies which help forward

scientific research in this country :-- The Donation Fund of the Royal

Society, derived from its surplus income. The British Association has contri-

buted 60,000Z. to aid research since its formation. The Royal Institution^

founded in the last century, by Count Rumford, for the promotion of

research, has assisted the investigations of Davy, of Young, of Faraday,

of Frankland, of Tyndal), of Dewar, and of Rayleigh. The City Com-

panies assist scientific research and foster scientific education both by direct

contributions and through the City and Guilds Institute. The Commis-

sioners of the Exhibition of 1851 devote 6,000?. annually to science

research scholarships, to enable students who have passed through a

college curriculum and have given evidence of capacity for original

research to continue the prosecution of science, with a view to its advance

or to its application to the industries of the country. Several scientific

societies, as, for instance, the Geographical Society and the Mechanical

Engineers, have promoted direct research, each in their own branch of

science, out of their surplus income ; and every scientific society largely

assists research by the publication, not only of its own proceedings, but
                                ADDRESS.                                33

often of the work going on abroad in the brinch of science which it

represents.

     The growing abundance of matter year by year increases the burden

thus thrown on their finances, and the Treasury has recently granted to

the Royal Society 1,000^. a year, to be spent in aid of the publication of

scientific papers not necessarily limited to those of that Society.

The Royal Society has long felt the importance to scientific research

of a catalogue of all papers and publications relating to pure and applied

science, arranged systematically both as to authors' names and as to sub-

ject treated, and the Society has been engaged for some time upon a

catalogue of that nature. But the daily increasing magnitude of these

publications, coupled with the necessity of issuing the catalogue with

adequate promptitude, and at appropriate intervals, renders it a task

which could only be performed under International co-operation. The

officers of the Royal Society have therefore appealed to the Govern-

ment to urge Foreign Governments to send delegates to a Conference to

be held next July to discuss the desirability and the scope of such a cata-

logue, and the possibility of preparing it.

The universities and colleges distributed over the country, besides their

function of teaching, are large promoters of research, and their voluntary

exertions are aided in some cases by contributions from Parliament in

alleviation of their expenses.

     Certain executive departments of the Government carry on research

for their own purposes, which in that respect may be classed as voluntary.

The Admiralty maintains the Greenwich Observatory, the Hydrographical

Department, and various experimental services ; and the War Office

maintains its numerous scientific departments. The Treasury maintains

a valuable chemical laboratory for Inland Revenue, Customs, and agri-

cultural purposes. The Science and Art Department maintains the Royal

College of Science, for the education of teachers and students from ele-
mentary schools. It allows the scientific apparatus in the national

museum to be used for research purposes by the professors. The Solar

Physics Committee, which has carried on numerous researches in solar
I^hysics, was appointed by and is responsible to this Department. The
Department also administers the Sir Joseph Whitworth engineering re-

search scholarships. Other scientific departments of the Government are

aids to research, as, for instance, the Ordnance and the Geological Surveys,

the Royal Mint, the Natural History Museum, Kew Gardens, and other

lesser establishments in Scotland and Ireland ; to which may be added,

to some extent, the Standards Department of the Board of Ti'ade, as well

as municipal museums, which are gradually spreading over the country.
     Por direct assistance to voluntary effort the Treasury contributes

4,000^. a year to the Royal Society for the promotion of research, which
is administered under a board whose members represent all branches of
Science. The Treasury, moreover, contributes to marine biological ob-

servatories, and in recent years has defrayed the cost of various expedi-
                                                                                        ^

tions for biological and astronomical research, which in the case of the
' Challenger ' expedition involved very large sums of money.

     In addition to these direct aids to science, Parliament, under tlie
Local Taxation Act, handed over to the County Councils a sum, -'.vhich
amounted in the year 1893 to 615,000/., to be expended on technical educa-

tion. In many country districts, so far as the advancement of real scien-
tific technical progress in the nation is concerned, much of this money
has been wasted for want of knowledge. And whilst it cannot be said

that the Government or Parliament have been indifferent to the promotion
of scientific education and research, it is a source of regret that the Govern-
ment did not devote some small portion of this magnificent gift to afford-
ing an object-lesson to County Councils in tlie application of science to
technical instruction, which woiUd have suggested the principles which
would most usefully guide them in the expenditure of this public money.

     Government assistance to science has been based mainly on the principle

of helping A'oluntary effort. The Kew Observatory was initiated as a

scientific observatory by the British Association. It is now supported

by the Gassiot trust fund, and managed by the Kew Observatory Com-

mittee of the Royal Society. Observations on magnetism, on meteorology,

and the record of sun-spots, as well as experiments upon new instruments
for assisting meteorological, thermometrical, and photographic purposes,
are being carried on there. The Committee has also arranged for the

verification of scientific measuring instruments, the rating of chrono-
meters, the testing of lenses and of other scientific apparatus. This
institution carries on to a limited extent some small portion of the class

of work done in Germany by that magnificent institution, the Reich sanstalt
 at Charlottenburg, but its development is fettered l)y want of funds.
 British students of science are compelled to resort to Bei'lin and Paris
 when they requii-e to compare their more delicate instruments and ap-
 paratus with recognised standards. There could scarcely be a more advan-
 tageous addition to the assistance which Government now gives to science

than for it to allot a substantial annual sum to the extension of the Kew

 Observatory, in order to develop it on the model of the Reichsanstalt.
 It might advantageously retain its connection with the Royal Society,

 under a Committee of Management representative of the various branches
 of science concerned, and of all parts of Great Britain.

                                                    Conclusion.

      The various agencies for scientific education have produced numerous
 students admirably qualified to pursue research ; and at the same time
 almost every field of industry presents openings for improvement through
 the development of scientific methods. For instance, agricultural opera-

 tions alone offer openings for research to the biologist, the chemist, the
 physicist, the geologist, the engineer, which have hitherto been largely
                              ADDRESS.                                   35

overlooked. If students do not easily find emploj'ment, it is chiefly at-
tributable to a want of appreciation for science in the nation at large.

     This want of appreciation appears to arise from the fact that those wlio

nearly half a century ago directed the movement of national education

wei'e trained in early life in the universities, in which the value of scientific

methods was not at that time fully recognised. Hence our elementary,

and even our secondary and great public schools, neglected for a long time

to encourage the spirit of investigation which develops originality. This

defect is diminishing daily.

There is, however, a more intangible cause which may have had influence

on the want of appreciation of science by the nation. The Government,

which largely profits by science, aids it with money, but it has done very

little to develop the national appreciation for science by recognising that

its leaders are worthy of honours conferred by the State. Science is not

--fashionable, and science students upon whose efibrts our progress as a
--nation so largely depends have not received the same measure of recog-

nition which the State awards to services rendered by its own officials, by

politicians, and by the Army and by the Navy, whose success in future

wars will largely depend on the efi'ective applications of science.

The Reports of the British Association aftord a complete chronicle of

the gradual growth of scientific knowledge since 18.31. They show that

the Association has fulfilled the objects of its founders in promoting and

disseminating a knowledge of science throughout the nation.

The growing connection between the sciences places our annual

meeting in the position of an arena where representatives of the difierent

sciences have the opportunity of criticising new discoveries and testing

the value of fresh proposals, and the Presidential and Sectional Addresses

operate as an annual stock-taking of progi*ess in the several branches of

science represented in the Sections. Eveiy year the field of usefiilness of

the Association is widening. For, whether with the geologist we seek

to write the history of the crust of the earth, or with the biologist to trace

out the evolution of its inhabitants, or whether with the astronomer, the

chemist, and the physicist we endeavour to unravel the constitution of the

sun and the planets or the genesis of the nebulffi and stars which make

up the universe, on every side we find ourselves surrounded by mysteries

Wewhich await solution.       are only at the beginning of work.

I have, therefore, full confidence that the future records of the Britisli

Association will chronicle a still greater progress than that already

achieved, and that the British nation will maintain its leading position

amongst the nations of the world, if it will energetically continue its

voluntary eflforts to promote research, supplemented l)y that additional

help from the Government which ought never to be withheld when a

clear case of scientific utility has been established.

     The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Professor

(Secretary). The Chairman of the Conference opened the proceedings
with the following address :

Address of the Chairman, G. J. Symons, F.R.S.

     Just as with tlie great Association under whose auspices we meet, so

--with the numerous and intellectual bodies which you represent each

has a double duty. The duty to humanity of doing its best to in-

terpret truthfully the lessons of the world in which we live, so that by

increasing knowledge future generations may learn to make better use of

its marvellous stores, and perchance repair some of the waste which has.

gone on in the past, and which is still going on. Our other duty is

to advance the cause of the ^arious bodies with which we are connected.

Of course you know this as well as I do, but in these days when a universal

genius has become an impossibility, and progress can be effected only by

limiting one's work to some corner of the field of science, there is great

danger of specialisation leading to forgetfulness of generalisation, and

of what is the end of all research. You all know the necessity for inter-

communication, which in the early years of this century rendered the

formation of the British Association imperative, and you know how that

need was met. I hold that this Conference and the work which it is doing

Association and the local societies gain the strength which arises from

federation.

    The Council having nominated me to the honourable office of Chair-

man,  my first and  most  pleasant  duty is  to  offer  you  a hearty welcome
                                                                                                                                                          ;.

and my second, which is a somewhat personal one, is to ask you to

remember that it is not given to every chairman mentally to photograph
every one present, and to remember not merely every face, but the name

of its owner ; it is one thing to be Chairman whom every one can see and

recognise, it is quite another thing for the Chairman to remember all the

faces before him. It is therefore from no lack of courtesy, but from the

physiological necessity, that I request that each delegate will preface his re-

marks by mentioning his name, and that of the Society which he represents.

    I have already intimated my opinion that if a man wishes to do good

work for science he must take some field, or corner of a field, and labour

--there. I have only a corner rainfall, but I think that I know enough

about some other parts of the field of meteorology to point out spots

--where good work could be done and work precisely suitable for the

members of your societies. Of course in the few minutes during which I

may detain you I cannot enter into details, but there is such an organisa-

tion as the Post Office. I do answer as many letters as I can, and an

extra twenty or thirty will make no appreciable difference.

NoAv, to take up the syllabus :

   --1. Meteorological observations in general. Do not encourage tlie
Akeeping of records from any but good instruments, properly placed.

hard frost occurs, and forthwith there is a crop of wonderful records, some
from thermometers badly placed, some from thermometers which never

were good, some from good thermometers allowed to go wrong. An

incorrect statement is much worse than none at all ; see to it then that
such records as you publish are worthy of your Society. I say no more

on this head because the Royal Meteorological Society has published,
almost at cost price (Is.), an amply illustrated pamphlet, 'Hints to

Observers,' which will show any one what, and when, and how, observations
ought to be made. It is by no means necessary to start with an elaborate
and costly set of instruments ; but see to it that the instruments which
you do have are good, and that no records except from good and tested

instruments, properly placed, ever appear in your volumes.

   --2, Sea and river femperatttre. I have interpolated the words ' and

river ' because I ouglit to have put them in the syllabus originally, and

because my attention has been drawn to the subject by an excellent

summary of Dr. Adolf Forster's work upon the temperatures of European
rivers, by Mr. H. N. Dickson, given in the September number of ' The
Geographical Journal.' You will remember that for a few years there was
a Committee of the British Association studying river temperature ; and I

am sure that if your societies took up the investigation, a fresh committee
could be appointed, so that we should not need to go to a German book to

learn the details of the temperature of the Thames. The work is easy,
healthy, and inexpensive. Easy, because it merely involves a walk to a

bridge, a jetty, or a pier- head, the lowering of the thermometer into the

water, entering the reading, and carrying it home again ; healthy, from the
regularity of the walk ; and inexpensive, because the verified K. O.

thermometer and its copper case, cord, and everything, could be sent to

any part of the country complete for a sovereign.
--42 EEPORT 1895.

     --3. Earth temperature at slialloio and at great depthx. The second half of

tliis subject has often been brought before you, because the Underground

Temperature Committee is the oldest one of the British Association. It,

as you know, deals chiefly with the temperature in mines and in deep

shafts and wells. Any one who can obtain good records at depths of, or

exceeding, 1,000 feet can do useful work, but I am doubtful whether much

juore can be learned in this country by observations at depths between

10 feet and 1,000 feet than we already know. I insert the words, 'in

this country,' because I do not think that the law of decrease for tropical

and for arctic localities is known. Unfortunately we have no representa-

tives of such localities here, or we might sow a productive seed. Obser-

--vations at shallow depths say 3 inches to 10 feet-- are becoming less rare

than they were, and the time is not distant when the law of temperature

variation for shallow depths will be known with sufficient accuracy. That

much has yet to be ascertained, many persons learned by burst water-

pipes last winter. I mention this as an illustration of the application of

scientific records to the welfare of mankind, not as an indication that I

consider the mischief to have been wholly produced by soil temperature
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but I must not distress.

  --4. Phenological loork. I am afraid that this word 'phenological' has not

proved very acceptable. I once heard an inquiry what meteorology had

--to do with prisons and it turned out that the querist had overlooked the

' h,' and reading it as ' penological ' thought that it must have something

to do with punishment. However, I need not tell you that it means the

laws of the life histoiy of plants and animals ; in fact, an endeavour to

record the progress of the seasons not by thermometers or by rain-gauges,

but by plants, trees, insects, and birds, and the study of the relations between

the indications of the natural history phenomena and those of the instru-

ments and eflbrts to separate cause and effect. It has always seemed to

me a class of work peculiarly adapted for the local scientific societies,

for their Botanical and Entomological Sections. The Royal Meteorological

Society has spent a considerable sum in promoting this work, and in the

hands of Mr. E. MaAvley it is progressing. Personally, I am not competent

to pronounce any criticism upon the work beyond this, that Mr. Mawley

has devoted liimself to it, and has produced tables and diagrams of great

interest. But I do say this, that I think that the naturalists should either

co-operate heartily with the meteorologists, or else should show that the

meteorologists are attempting the impossible or the undesii-able.

  --5. Early meteorological records. It is a prevalent idea (especially with

executors) that old manuscript books of observations are useless. I have

every reason to believe that a long deceased relative of my own assisted

--in burning part of the oldest i-ecord of the rainfall in this country that

begun at Townley in Lancashire in 1677 ; and wliat she did at the
beginning of this century has been done by scores of others, and will be

until mankind are much more thoughtful and much better informed than

they yet are. But I am not addressing you in the capacity of executors,

but as representatives of large local bodies, many of them with museums

and  libraries                                  and I invite  you to  see  to  it  that  any such  records  that
                                             ;

you have are properly cared for.

   --Another suggestion the practice is fortunately rapidly spreading of

publishing the early parochial registers. If each society represented here

would make it a rule to go through all such publications as have been

issued within its area, and print in chronological order all the notes on
     CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.                                                                43

earthquakes, storms, frosts, floods, &c., whicli can be collected, much good

would be done. Of course this can be done for unpublished as well as

for published records.

  --6. Records of river and well levels. The second half of this subject

has so often been brought before you by Mr. De Ranee, the Secretary of

the British Association Committee on Underground Water, that I need

merely mention it. The first part refers to a subject involved in my next

and last heading, and to which, therefore, I will at once proceed.

  --7. Records offloods mid the placing offlood- marks. It is very strange

that Englishmen (Britons I had better say, for our Irish and Scotch

friends are equally bad) are so nearly the worst nation in Europe for

looking after their rivers. I do not refer to fouling by sewage and by

--manufactui-ing refuse, or to defective engineering I do not know where
--we stand in those respects but I refer to records of river levels, to scale

marks on the bridges, to automatic recorders of their rise and fall, to
arrangements for warning the owners of low-lying property when floods

are probable, and to the classification, levelling, and publication in full, of

particulars as to old flood-level marks, and the due marking of new ones

when floods occur. I do not suggest that your societies should themselves

do all this, but that they should bring it before their Parish and County

Councils, and couple their request with the ofl'er of any assistance in their

power. Of course the suggestion will be received politely, the great cost

will be urged, and in many cases nothing will be done. Forgive my

detaining you to hear a little true story. Years ago I suggested such

--arrangements to an influential ' man in York nothing was done. In

1892 York had a flood, not so bad as some on record, but one which cost

the  Corporation a very large  sum                         they  paid  it, and  that  steed  having
                                                        ;

been stolen they have figuratively locked the stable door by adopting all

the arrangements suggested above. If the Councils do not take your

advice, they must remember that your attendance will be on their
minutes, to be referred to when their town or district sufl'ers as York did.

     The Chairman then read a letter which he had received from Mr. R.
Ashworth, of the Rochdale Literary and Scientific Society, who regretted
his inability to attend and sent some notes showing what meteorological
work was being done in his district.

     Mr. T. V. Holmes (Secretary) wished to make a few remarks with

regard to the list of papers read before the Corresponding Societies and

appended to the Report of the Corresponding Societies Committee. He

hoped that the secretaries of the various local societies, in sending in their
lists, would be very careful where the paper, from its title, might belong
to either of two sections, to group it with that section to which it had
most aflinity. Examination had in some cases caused a jiaper to be
classed Avith another section than that originally given. It was very
necessary also that the names of papers sent in .should not be those of
mere popular lectures, but of investigations of a more or less original

character. It had occasionally happened that when reference had to be
made to some paper on the list in order to ascertain its true nature it had
been found that the paper in question had not been sent to Burlington

House. No paper would in future be placed on the list published by

the British Association unless it could be consulted at the Office.

     The Chairman then invited discussion on the subjects mentioned in his

address.

--44 REPORT 1835.

     Captain G. R. Elwes (Dorset) laid upon the table a paper on the rain-
fall in Dorset, which had been compiled by a member of the Dorset Natural
History and Antiquarian Field Club, Mr. Eaton, from records kept in the
county of Dorset during the last forty years. It was a most careful and
exhaustive piece of work, and was illustrated by maps and diagrams.
Mr. Eaton wished to have the paper submitted to that conference of
delegates with the view of eliciting remarks upon it.

     The Chairman said that Mr. Eaton was an old friend of his, and
he had much pleasure in testifying to the excellence of his work. One of
the maps of Dorset was shaded so as to show the proportionate amount of
the rainfall, the other the varying elevation of the land, and, as might have
been expected, there was a fair amount of parallelism between the two.
Mr. Eaton's work was an admirable example of the way in which the
rainfall of a county should be worked out, a labour especially requiring

much patience and perseverance. He wished they could have such

memoirs for every county.
      Mr. Sowerbutts remarked upon the difficulty of discussing Mr. Eaton's

paper in the absence of copies of it, and Professor Meldola said that

there was not much to discuss, as the paper had been brought forward
simply as an example of the way in which such work should be done.

Professor Merivale asked whether it would be possible to obtain copies of
Mr. Eaton's paper, and Captain Elwes said that he would do his best

to get copies for any gentlemen who would give in their names.

      Mr. Hopkinson stated that twenty years ago he began to record the
rainfall of Hertfordshire with about twenty observers, and he had since

done his best to add to their number, with the result that there were now
about forty. The report which he had published last year contained the
monthly returns from forty observers in Hertfordshire. He had obtained

about thirty daily records, which were worked up and analysed but not
published. In the Transactions of the Hertfordshire Natural History
Society much space was devoted to meteorological work and to phenology,
 and he hoped that the Societies in other counties would work similarly at

these subjects. He trusted also that delegates would preserve any early

 meteorological records they might discover.

     Mr. De Ranee, in illustration of the increasing usefulness of local

 societies, mentioned the fact that two Committees of the British Asso-

--ciation, of which for many years he had been secretary that on Coast

 Erosion, and that investigating the Circulation of Underground Waters
had just ceased to exist in consequence of the admirable way in which
 their work had been taken up by the Corresponding Societies.

      His Honour Deemster Gill mentioned that the subject of Coast Erosion
 had been taken up by a Committee of the Legislature of the Isle of Man,
 of which he was a member, but their in\'estigations were not yet complete.
 But they had found that for some twenty miles on the west, the north-
 west, and the north, erosion had been going on to a very large extent, the
 evidence showing a destruction of land of about twenty acres to the mile
 within the last fifty or sixty years. The whole of the information would
be sent to the proper Department when the investigation was concluded.
Deemster Gill added, in reply to a question, that the portion of the coast
mentioned was not rocky but sandy.

     The Chairman remarked that the meteorology of the Isle of Man was

 being looked after by Mr. A. W. Moore, and Deemster Gill added that all

 that was necessary was being done thei-e in that department.
COREE^PONDING SOCIETIES.  4-j

     Mr. Soweibutts asked whether it was desirable that the Manchester

Society sliould collect the results of observations at the observatories, and
forward them to the Meteorological Society, and the Chairman replied

that it was just one of the things wanted. Mr. Sowerbutts added that,
though there were several observatories whose observations were hardly
worth having, there was a thoroughly efficient one in the Park, under the

Whitworth Trustees, another at St. Bede's, and a third at the Manchester

Waterworks.

     Captain Elwes hoped that it might be possible to induce local scientific

societies to co-operate for the discovery of flint implements, and the for-

mulation of results. He wished that they would make this branch of

investigation a more special feature of their work than it was at present.

    Mr. Osmund W. Jeffs, Secretary to the British Association Committee

for the Collection and Preservation of Geological Photographs, stated that

it had been proposed by the Committee, and adopted by the Council of the

British Association, that the photographs collected, should be placed in the

Museum of Practical Geology, Jermyn Street. The first part of the collec-

tion, consisting of 800 photographs, had already been deposited there, and
the rest would be handed over as soon as possible. As, however, a great

many parts of the British Isles were still unrepi-esented, it was proposed that
they should go on collecting. From some of the eastern counties no pho-

tographs whatever had been sent, and on that very day he had been pro-

mised some from that neighbourhood. He hoped, therefoi-e, that the

delegates would remember that they were still collecting, and would men-

tion the fact to their respective societies.

    Mr. De Ranee, after complimenting Mr. Jeffs on the results he had

achieved, remarked that it would be a good thing if each society would

issue a circular, and send it to other local societies, so that all might know

what photographs had been taken in each locality, and were available,
and, on the other hand, in what districts photographers were most needed.

     Mr. Sowerbutts dwelt on the very valuable results already attained by
Mr. Jeffs, and proposed a hearty vote of thanks to him for his exertions.
This vote was seconded by His Honour Deemster Gill. After a few words
in support of it from the Chairman it was carried unanimously Mr. Jeffs,
in acknowledgment of the vote of thanks, said that they were due rather to
the Geological Photographs Committee than to himself personally, and
that the work could not have been carried out as it had been but for the
active co-operation of a great number of the local societies.

    Mr. J. B. Murdoch (Glasgow) thought that in too many of their

investigations Scotland was excluded. He might mention as an example

the British Association Committee for recording the position, &c., of the
Erratic Blocks of England, Wales, and Ireland.

    Mr. De Eance stated that the Erratic Blocks Committee was formed
many years before the meetings of the delegates of the Corresponding
Societies began to take place. Any Scottish member of the British

Association might have brought the matter before the General Committee
and proposed the extension of the work to Scotland.

     Some remarks were made by Mr. Sowerbutts and Mr. G. P. Hughes
on Scotland as a nursery of boulders, and the Chairman said that his
impression was that many years ago some one suggested the inclusion of
Scotland in the labours of the Erratic Blocks Committee, and was
answered by a speaker who stated that the Royal Society of Edinburgh
was already at work on the subject, and that it would be unwise to
--46 REPORT 1895,

trespass upon its territory. For his own part he was always pleased
to co-operate with his Scottish friends, and had done so on the question
of rainfall, and it would appear that in this Erratic Blocks Committee the
exclusion of Scotland was the result of deference to her susceptibilities.

    Mr. Murdoch replied that it was quite true that for many years a

Boulder Committee had existed in vScotland, but the work had been
entirely under the control and direction of Mr. Milne Home, who was
now dead, and who, for some time before his death, had been unable to
get about the country. Mr. Milne Home's Committee liad issued eight

yearly reports, which were very valuable, as many of the boulders were
not only tabulated, but figured. But for some time the work had been

practically at a standstill.

     The Chairman remarked that in that case it was certainly desirable
that steps should be taken to have Scotland included.

    Deemster Gill said that the boulders of the Isle of Man were being

noted by the Society to which he belonged, but not, he thought, by any

extraneous body.
      Professor Merivale remarked that for some time they had been dis-

cussing matters connected with Section 0. He wished, befoi'e the meeting

ended, to say a few words on Flameless Explosives (Section G). The
North of England Institute of Mining Engineers had been continuing
their experiments, and had published one report. They were still going
on with their labours, and another report would be published shortly.

He had nothing to say then as to the results of their experiments.

     The Chairman supposed that the Conference was, as usual, in favour
of an application to the General Committee for a grant of 30/. to enable
the Corresponding Societies Committee to carry on its work.

      Professor Meldola moved that an application for a grant of 30/. should
be made, remarking that the amount named was only just sufficient to
cover their expenses. The proposition was seconded by Mr. Hopkinson
and carried unanimously.

                      Second Conference, September 17, 1895.

      The Corresponding Societies Committee was represented by Dr.
Garson (in the chair), Mr. Hopkinson, Mr. Symons, and Mr. T. V.
Holmes (Secretary).

      Dr. Garson said that Mr. Symons could not take the chair, as he v/as
then at the meeting of the Committee of Recommendations. It was
 usual at their Second Conference to consider the recommendations from
the various Sections respecting work in which it was thought the Corre-

sponding Societies might usefully co-operate. He would therefore, in the

first place, call upon the representative of Section A.

                                                  Section A.

     Mr. White Wallis stated that Mr. Symons, who had been chosen the
representative of Section A, had asked him to attend the Conference in

 his stead. It had been resolved that the Committees for investigating
 Earth Tremors and Seismological Phenomena in Japan should be merged
into one with the title of ' Committee for Seismological Observations.' Its
members would be Mr. G. J. Symons, chairman; Mr. C. Davison and Mr.

J. Milne, secretaries ; Lord Kelvin, Professor W. C. Adams, Mr. C. H.

 Bottomley, Sir F. J. Bramwell, Professor G. H. Darwin, Mr. Horace
 Darwin, Mr. G. F. Deacon, Professor J. A. Ewing, Professor A. H. Green,
 Professor G. C. Knott, Professor G. A. Lebour, Professor R. Meldola,

AProfessor J. Perry, Professor J. H. Poynting, and Dr. I. Roberts.

afrant of 80^. had been made to this Committee. The Committee for tlie
application of Photography to Meteorology had been re-appointed with a
o"rant of 15/., and the Underground Temperature Committee had been
re-appointed without a grant. They were aware that the observatory of
Professor Milne in Japan had been destroyed by fire, and that he now had
an observatory in the Isle of Wight, hence the merging of the Committee

for Seismological Observations with that for the observation of Earth

Tremors. It was hoped that Professor Milne, who was particularly clever

in designing inexpensive apparatus, might be able to produce suitable
apparatus at a small cost for taking seismological observations, which
might be widely distributed over the country, and be largely used by

members of local scientific societies. With regard to the Meteorological
Photographs Committee, no special work for the Corresponding Societies
had been suggested by the Committee, who were simply anxious to obtain
photogi'aphs of lightning, rainbows, halos, tfec. The Committee was just
then arranging for synchronous photographs of clouds. Near Exeter they

had a straight base line about a quarter of a mile long. Photogra,phie
observatories had been erected at each end, and there was a signalling

apparatus between the two points, so that photographs of passing clouds

might be obtained from both observatories simultaneously. Work of this

kind, however, would hardly be taken up warmly by those societies which
were mainly natural history societies, though he hoped it would commend

itself to those more devoted to engineering, geology, and meteorology.
     The Chairman hoped that delegates would make special note of the work

just described.

     The Pv,ev. J. O. Bevan asked if anything was known of the meteoro-

logical work formerly done at Stonyhurst by Father Pei-ry. He believed

similar work was still being done there, and would like to know if there

had been any communication between the authorities at Stonyhurst and
the Meteorological Photographs Committee. If meteorological work was
still carried on at Stonyhurst, it was important that the Committee should

know what was being done there,
     Mr. Sowerbutts knew that the work done by Father Perry was still

being carried on at Stonyhurst, and that the Father in charge was a highly

trained scientific man. He was afraid that town societies could never do

anything in noting earth tremors on account of the tremors caused by

passing trains, waggons, &c. He did not know any spot within seven

miles of Manchester where a recording instrument might safely be placed,

unless it were at the bottom of a coal mine.
     The Rev. J. O. Bevan believed that these superficial tremors were of

short duration and would not affect the observations made with any

properly- constructed meteorological instrument. Had they any connection,
he asked, with the Observatories at Greenwich and at Kew 1

     Mr. White Wallis said that the Committee were certainly in communi-

cation with both Kew and Greenwich, and he would note the suggestion

that they should communicate with Stonyhurst. As regards the supposed

difficulty of making observations on earth tremors in towns he might say

that modern instruments were practically unaffected by passing vibrations

Afrom railway trains, &.c.  tremor of such short duration was not repre-

sented on these instruments. They had one in a cellar, but though the

vibration of a passing train was felt in the house, it was not recorded by

the instrument. Darwin's bifilar pendulum was somewhat expensive

Professor Milne accomplished the .same result in a much simpler way.
--48 REPORT 1895.

     The Chairman pointed out that the delegates might understand from
what had been said that the whole cost of the needful apparatus would
not necessarily exceed from 20/. to 251., including the erection of a suit-
able column on which to place it.

                                                   Section C.

     Mr. A. S. Reid, representing Section C, remarked that Mr. Osmund

Jeffs, Secretaiy to the Geological Photographs Committee, had wished to
resign, but had been persuaded to retain the post for another year, Mr.

W. W. Watts having consented to act as co-secretary during that time,

and afterwards to become sole secretary. Mr. Jefts, liowever, would

always be glad to forward any photographs which may reach him. The

Committee had at one time thought of bringing their work to a conclu-
.sion, but had lately felt that it would not be judicious to do so. The
Erratic Blocks Committee had altered their title so as to include Scotland,
and had added some Scottish geologists to their list of members. In
answer to the Chairman, who asked in what way the Corresponding
Societies could assist the Geological Photographs Committee, Mr. Reid
replied that the best plan was for persons interested to write to Mr. Jeffs
for information. The Committee were sending out a new circular con-
taining instructions as to the best methods of using the camera, and the
best kind of camera to use, together with an abstract of the opinions
collected on those subjects.

     Mr. Sowerbutts wished delegates to remember that platinotype photo-
graphs were the best to send, as those printed by the bromide process often
faded very rapidly, while platinotype prints would not.

     Mr. Murdoch had been glad to learn that Scotland was now included

in the sphere of the Erratic Blocks Committee, and hoped that the
Earth Tremors Committee, which was still a purely English Committee,
would also be modified so as to comprise Scotland.

     The Chairman remarked that these and other Committees were com-
posed of members of the British Association who were chosen on account
of their special work and quite irrespective of their nationality or place of
residence. In some cases there were observers only in England. But,
whatever its title, every Committee was anxious to get information from
whatever quarter it was obtainable.

     Mr. Hopkinson said that as regards the Erratic Blocks Committee, the
reason for the exclusion of Scotland was the fact that a similar Committee
for Scotland already existed in Edinburgh. In other cases it was simply

an oversight. He was glad that the Geological Photographs Committee

continued to exist, as there would always be a reason for its existence,
one of its chief objects being to obtain photographs of temporary sections.

     Mr. Reid remarked that the Committee did not wish to cease to exist,
but they hoped the work would be taken up and carried on at the Jermyn
Street Museum.

     Mr. M. B. Slater thought that an exchange of local geological photo-
graphs among the various Corresponding Societies would be a good thing.

     Mr. Sowerbutts approved of Mr. Slater's suggestion, and was sure that
the Manchester Geographical Society would gladly exchange photographs
with any other societies. They were then receiving some very handsome
geological photographs from the Carpathian Society.

     The Chairman remarked that the Geological and Geographical Societies
would be most likely to welcome an exchange of geological photographs.
       CORRESPONDIXG SOCIETIES.                                       49^

Mr. Hopkinson thought that most of the Corresponding Societies would

wish to exchange geological photographs.

   A discussion here took place on some practical difficulties attending

the interchange of photographs, such as the burden likely to be laid on
the shoulders of the amateur photographer, &c., in which Mr. Gow, Mr.
Reid, Mr. Sowerbutts, Mr. Slater, and the Chairman took part. Mr.
Hopkinson thought that the work of printing and distributing copies of

photographs might easily be done at the Jermyn Street Museum at a

small fixed charge, and Mr. Reid inclined towards a plan brought under

his notice by Mr. Gray of Belfast. At that town a photographer had
been appointed who received the negatives taken by various members of
the local society and furnished as many copies as were desired at a small

fixed charge. Persecution of the amateur was thus avoided.

                             Section E.

Mr. Sowerbutts said that the Committee of Section E had passed a

resolution referring to the difficulties at present thrown in the way of
pupils who wish to become teachers of geography, marks gained in that

subject not counting except in certain cases. They had requested the

General Committee of the British Association to permit them to have a

Committee for the purpose of examining and reporting to the Association

on the condition of the teaching of geography in Great Britain. They

wished to make a careful examination into the teaching of geography in

all schools, especially secondary schools, and to report next year. They

had not asked for a grant. It was probable that the Corresponding So-

cieties might be asked to furnish certain information, and he hoped their

Secretaries would reply as promptly as possible.

The Rev. J. O. Bevan did not know whether he was in order in refer-

ring to the report of the Conference of Delegates at Nottingham. He

should have liked to know in what county ' children attending schools

were not taught geography in any way.' Having had a large experience

of secondary schools, he also considered the statement made at Notting-
ham that geography is absolutely ignored in secondary schools to be de-

cidedly erroneous, though it was not taught in every primary school except

in connection with reading.

Mr. Reid asked if the Committee meant to inquire into the teaching

of geography in such schools as Eton and Harrow.

Mr. Sowerbutts replied that they hoped to extend tlieir inquiry from

primary schools to the Universities. They wanted the Committee of the

Royal Geographical and other societies to see whether some method can-

not be devised by which geography may be placed on an equal footing

with other subjects, and be made a paying subject to the teacher.

Mr. Hopkinson (Hertfordshire) said that geography was taught in

nearly all the schools with which he was acquainted, and was well taught

in those of the Church Schools Company.

The Rev. J. O. Bevan remarked that the Geographical Society had

instituted examinations in geography in secondary schools, and gave gold
medals and other prizes.

     Mr. Sowerbutts rejoined that the Royal Geographical Society were so

--dissatisfied with the results of these examinations the whole of the

medals having been taken by two schools-- that they had resolved to
discontinue them. The Mancliester Geographical Society had had a

similar experience in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Cheshire.

50 REPORT-- 1895.

                                              Section H.

     Mr. Hartland said that he was there owing to the very sad and sudden
bereavement sustained a few weeks ago by Mr. Brabrook, the Chairman

of the Ethnographical Survey Committee, who was consequently unable
to attend. The Ethnographical Survey was a matter in which the Corre-

sponding Societies were especially capable of rendering assistance. Indeed,
without their aid, it was almost impossiljle that the work could be carried
to a successful issue. The Committee drew up in the early part of the
year a circular to the local societies offering them copies of the schedule.
Hitherto, however, they had met with little response from the local socie-

ties. Possibly the schedule was not sufficiently self-explanatory. The
work of the Ethnographical Survey had so many branches that one of
them could hardly fail to interest the more active members of the local

societies. When the Committee had obtained its grant, as it hoped to do,

it proposed to begin operations in Galway, having found a thoroughly

qualified man to undertake the work, the expense having been estimated
at 20^. He hoped to be able to report progress at the next meeting, and

would be very glad, in the meantime, if the Corresponding Societies would
circulate their schedules and bring the Survey under the notice of their
members.

      Mr. Slater said that he wished to say a few words on behalf of Dr.

Colby, who was unavoidably absent. Dr. Colby (Malton) was chairman

of a sub-committee which was already going on with the work, though it
was not sufficiently advanced to allow of a report this year. However, he
 hoped to be able to send one next year. The district in which Dr. Colby
was working was a very primitive one.

      INIr. Hartland remarked that the Malton Naturalists' Society was one
 of those which had responded to their circular.

      The Chairman noted the great variety of the work proposed by the
 Ethnographical Survey Committee. Besides the physical measurements
 required, and the colour of the hair, eyes, &c., there was a wide field for the
 amateur photographer, for those interested in folklore, linguistic differ-
 ences, place-names, and local variations in tastes and habits. The Ethno-
 graphical Committee have a certain number of instruments which they are
 willing to place in the hands of those who would undertake measurements.
 The note drawn up by Mr. Hartland would still further exemplify the
 kind of work required. The Committee had met with great success during
 the past year, and the work done around Ipswich was very satisfactory.

 He trusted that the delegates would urge their societies to form local

 centres everywhere to carry on the work.
       Mr. Hartland wished to draw attention to a point which had not been

 mentioned, the preservation of ancient monuments of all kinds, which

 should be scheduled, described, and photographed. He had just received

 a letter from the secretary of a local committee in Pembrokeshire, who

 stated that some ancient stones and some pit dwellings had ah-eady been

  discovered there.

       The Chairman wished to say a word or two about another Committee

 that concerned with the measurement of school-children. Many schools
 had been doing good work in their own way, but, unfortunately, there had

 been no uniform system, so t"hat the results at one school could not be
 compared with those at another. The Committee, after inquiring into the
 various systems practised, had drawn up one which he hoped would prove
 acceptable to the various schools. It was of the highest importance that
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  51

some uniform system should be adopted. Professor Windle of Birmingham

would be happy to send a schedule of the various measurements required,

and of the way in which they should be made.
     The Rev. J. O. Bevan spoke of the desirability of expediting the

Archaeological Survey of the kingdom which had been begun a few years

ago. He had been working at the map of Herefordshire for some years,

and it was then almost ready for publication. It could not be too widely
known that the Society of Antiquaries was willing to bear the expense of
printing the maps if the work on them was done in accordance with the

conditions laid down. He was surprised that this work liad not been

taken up more energetically by properly qualified persons in the different

Hedistricts, so that it might be executed with as little delay as possible.

hoped each delegate would take an early opportunity of reporting the

proceedings at these Conferences to the society he represented.
     The Chairman believed that it was generally understood that it was

the duty of each delegate to report their proceedings to his society.
     Mr. Hopkinson stated that he had brought the work of the Ethno-

graphical Survey Committee before the Hertfordshire Natural History

Society, but had failed to get the matter taken up. He found that the ques-

tions asked were considered too inquisitorial. Possibly a simpler system
might be found to answer better in practice, as more persons or societies
would then be found willing to undertake the work.

     Mr. Hartland replied that, though they hoped in many cases to get

the elaborate measurements asked for, they were glad to obtain such

measurements and photographs as could be procured. He was afraid that

the elaboration of their schedule must have acted to some extent as a
deterrent, though it was drawn up as a standard to which they hoped to
attain, not as necessarily obligatory in every case. Possibly, if this were
understood, societies would respond more warmly to their appeals for help.

     Dr. Brett (Hertfordshire) said that since the York meeting of the
British Association fifteen years ago it had been his custom as a medical
man to record the weight, height, colour of hair and eyes, &c., of children.

He had up to that time made about three thousand observations, but had

not yet been able to put his records into shape.

     Mr. Hopkinson (referring to the Ethnographical Survey) remarked
that his experience was that of others as to the difficulty of getting any

one to make the very elaborate series of measurements asked for. He

would suggest some simpler scheme as an alternative.

     Mr. Hartland hoped that members who objected to the elaborate
measurements would take up the subjects of dialect, folklore, or

historical or prehistoric monuments. They wanted information on all

these points.

     The Chairman remarked that the work might usefully be divided
among various sub-committees. If that were done all societies would
do good work in one department or another, if not in all.

     The Conference then came to an end.

    The Committee recommend the retention of all the societies now on
the list except the Cumberland and Westmoreland Association, which has

ceased to exist.

     The Committee have pleasure in reporting that the Caradoc and
Severn Valley Field Club and the Buchan Field Club have been added
to the list of Corresponding Societies.

--Underground Temperature. Twenty-first Report of the Committee,

     consisting of Professoi- J. D. Everett (Chairman and Secretary),
    Lord Kelvin, Mr. G. J. Symons, Sir A. Geikie, Mr. J. Glaisher,

    Professor E. Hull, Professor J. Prestwich, Dr. C. Le Neve-

Information as to underground temperature in the southern hemisphere

has hitherto been very scanty. Importance therefore attaches to observa-

tions which have recently been taken in a deep bore in New South Wales

by T. W. Edgeworth David, Professor of Geology in Sydney University,

and E. F. Pittman, Government Geologist. The following account is

derived from a paper by these gentlemen to the Royal Society of N.S.W.,

read December 6, 1893, supplemented by letters from Professor David to

the Secretary of the Committee.

The bore is 2,929 ft. deep, and is the second of two which have been

sunk at Cremorne on the shores of Port Jackson.

   A protected maximum thermometer had been furnished by the sec-

retary to Professor David when he went out to Sydney in 1882 ; but it
had passed through several hands, and was not forthcoming when the

opportunity for observation occurred. Professor David had accordingly

to avail himself of such instruments as were accessible, and he borrowed

four maximum thermometers, including two inverted Negretti's belonging

to Mr. H. C. Russell, the Government Astronomer, which had Kew certi-

ficates. They were similar in pattern to those adopted by the Committee,

except that there was no outer glass-case. In place of this, ' a strong

piece of wrought iron water-pipe, about two feet three inches in length,'

Awas employed. ' cap-piece was sweated on to the lower end of this tube,

the threads of the screw in the cap-piece and pipe being filled with molten

solder, and the cap-piece being screwed on while the solder was still

molten.' ' The lower end of the pipe was then filled to a depth of about

two inches with Drass tui-nings. The thermometers were next carefully

lowered into the tube.' They had their bulbs uppermost, as usual. ' Brass

turnings were then packed around them in order that the heat might be

conducted rapidly to their bulbs from the water in the bore. Strings

were fastened to the bulbs to facilitate the withdrawal of the thermo-

meters from the tube after the experiment of taking the temperature had

been completed. The ends of these strings were carried close up to the

top of the pipe, the brass turnings being packed aroiind them like tamping

Aaround a fuse in a shot-hole.   few cardboard wads and a layer of loose

paper two inches in thickness were inserted in the upper portion of the

tube, to prevent the conduction downwards of the artificial heat, which

would otherwise travel down to the thermometers from the upper end of

the tube when it was dipped in the molten solder, previous to the upper

Acap-piece being sweated on.     ring-bolt for attaching the lowering cord

was screwed into the upper cap-piece, with molten solder sweated into it

and the whole cap-piece was then screwed and sweated on to the upper

end of the tube in the same manner as the lower cap-piece.'
--76 REPORT 1895.

     The first experiment was a failure, the thermometers, though left for
about an hour near the bottom of the bore, indicating about the same
temperature that they had before lowering. This failure is attributed
either to the non-conducting action of a few thicknesses of soft paper in
which the bulbs were wrapped, or to the mercury which had left the bulbs
having returned to them again while the tube was being conveyed from
the bore to the plumber's shop, where the cap-piece was removed.

     In the second experiment ' no paper was wrapped round the bulbs,
but the brass dust was continuous from the bulbs to the sides of the iron

pipe.' At the depth of 2,733 ft. an obstruction was encountered which

prevented the tube from going lower, and which also caused the suspend-
ing wire to kink and break. After an immersion of about twenty-seven
hours, the wire was successfully grappled, and the tube brought to the sur-
face. ' The upper cap-piece was then rapidly heated in a chafing dish of
charcoal made of an old nail-can, with a hole cut out of the bottom just
sufficiently large to admit of the upper eixd of the tube being passed up
it, and oxygen gas from a compressed cylinder was blown through a
Fletcher's blowpipe on to the charcoal, so that in less than half a minute
the solder in the threads of the cap-piece was melted ; the lower portion
of the tube containing the thei'mometers being meanwhile wrapped in wet
cloths to prevent the heat travelling downwards. The cap-piece having
been unscrewed and the thermometers withdrawn, the highest temperature
registered was found to be 97° F.' ' Not a drop of water had found its
way into the tube.'

    On the following day the experiment was repeated, no wire being used

for lowering, but only tarred rope ; and sheet lead was wrapped round
the tube to increase the weight. The tube was left down for one hour,

and the maximum temperature registered was 96° F. The difference of

1° below the former observation is what might fairly be expected from
the stirring of the water and the thermal capacity of the sheet lead
which, with the tube, weighed 30 lb. The first result, 97° F., is therefore
adopted as the true temperature at the depth of 2,733 ft. The mean sur-
face temperature, as determined by Mr. H. C. Russell, is 63° F., giving
an increase of 34° in 2,733 ft., which is at the rate of 1° F. for 80 ft.

     As regards the possibility of disturbance of temperature by convection,

Professor David mentions in a letter to the Secretary that the bore was

only four inches in diameter. He also says, ' You understand, of course,

that we can do nothing in the way of taking temperatures in a diamond-

drill bore until the bore is quite completed, owing to the chilling of the
rock at the sides of the borehole by the cold water which is being con-
stantly forced to circulate under pressure through the bore.'

      The temperatuie of the water of Port Jackson at the greatest depths
near Cremorne, varying from 45 to 63 ft., was found (on December 6,

1893) to be uniform at 68° F. As this temperature is higher than that of

the ground at the same level, no cooling effect can be attributed to the
water. The slow rate of 1° F. per 80 ft., deduced from the observations,
would therefore appear to be a good approximation to the truth.

      It is expected that shafts will shortly be sunk at Ci-emorne, and will
afford opportunity for the systematic observation of rock temperatures
from the surface to a depth of nearly 3,000 ft. 'The first 1,000 ft. will
be in horizontally bedded sandstone, and the remainder chiefly in clay
shales, with interstratified sandstones and conglomerates.' The observa-
tions will be taken by Professor David and Mr. Pittman, with the

--The Uniformity of Size of Pages of Scientific Societies' Puhlications.

    Beport of the Committee, consistinq of Professor S. P. Thompson
     (Chairman), Mr. G. H. Bryan, 'Dr. C. V. Burton, Mr. R. T,

     Glazebrook, Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney, and Mr. J. Swinburne

(Secretary).

              [PLATE I.]

The importance of adopting one or two uniform standard sizes for the
pages of scientific publications will be evident to all specialists who have
collected reprints of papers on any branch of science, and who have en-
deavoured to have them bound into volumes. Such collections are of
more than passing interest, and they might, with advantage in many
cases, be handed down to posterity as records of work in any particular

subject, and it is, therefore, of importance that they should not be spoiled
by the omission of one or two papers whose size precludes them from
being bound up with the rest.

     The Committee have thought it advisable in their first year to confine
their attention chiefly to reporting on the size of the pages of existing
mathematical and physical publications, and to deciding on what sizes to
recommend as standards. In the latter matter they have been largely
guided by the consideration that uniformity has been already to some
extent attained, and this report will show that the desired results can be
accomplished without making any radical changes in the sizes of the
principal journals, and, indeed, without altering most of them at all.

     In deciding whether two papers can or cannot be bound together, the
size of the margin is quite as important a factor as the size of the paper.

Thus the ' Bulletin of the New York Mathematical Society ' is more than

a centimetre wider and two centimetres higher than the ' Report of the
British Association,' and yet if it were cut down to the same size it would

still have exactly the same margin at the sides, and 6 mm. more margin

at the top and bottom of the pages. Again, the ' Proceedings of the
Pliy.sical Society ' are printed with the same type as the ' Philosophical

Magazine,' although one is medium and the other demy octavo. Hence
arises the necessity of taking an internal measurement of the space occu-
pied by the letterpress, as well as an external measurement of the size of

the paper page.

    This may be estimated as in fig. 1, which represents the opened pages

of a book, a, b denote the width and depth of a paper page, c is the

distance from the outside edge of the letterpress to the back, and d is the
distance from the top of the running headline or number of the page to the
bottom of the last line of letterpress, exclusive of the ' signature.' Hence

-- --a c is the margin at the side of the page, and b d is the sum of the

margin at the top and bottom, so that if these are equal each is equal
to ^(b-d).

     By adopting a minimum limit for the size of the pages (measured by
a, b), and a somewhat smaller maximum limit for the internal measure-

         UNIFORMITY OF SIZE OF PAGES OF SOCIETIES' PUBLICATIONS. 79

 (22 cm. X 28-5 cm., or 8| in. X llj in.) almost universal, but the pre-
 ponderating sizes approach most nearly to demy, and on account of the
 large margins of many journals this is the most convenient size of the
 two, besides making the volumes less unwieldy. The Committee, there-

--fore, recommefid, in cases where it is desired to retain the quarto size, the

 following measurements :

   --Standard Quarto Size. Paper demy, the pages measuring, when uncut,

 22 cm. x28'5 cm., or 8^ in. wide x 11 J in. high. Reprints and unbound
 numbers of this size to be uncut, or cut 0-25 cm., or ^ in. Measurements

--of letterpress to be c:=18*5 cm., or 7^ in., d=2l-5 cm., or 8| in.
      Limits of Quarto Size. Paper pages not to measureless than 21 '5 cm.,
or 8| in., wide x 28 cm., or 11 in., high. Letterpress not to exceed the

measurements 0=19 cm., or 7| in., d-=23 cm., or 9 in.

      The same remarks as to the advantage of standard and limiting sizes
 apply as in the case of the octavo. Allowing for 0'25 cm., or ^ in., being
 cut oflf in binding, the limiting sizes will allow of a margin of not less than
 2 cm., or | in., all round, while the standard size will give a margin of 3*25
cm., or 1;^ in., at the sides, and 2-5 cm., or 1 in., at the top and bottom.

     Plates often get sadly mutilated when different papers are bound
together, and sometimes this even happens when a volume of any periodi-
cal is bound up. Where they are folded over they not infrequently get
cut in two by the guillotine. To avoid this the Committee recommend
that the dimensions of the illustrations should never exceed 13 cm. x 20 cm.,
or 5i in. x 7|- in., for octavo plates, and 21 cm. x 25 cm., or 8^ in. x 10 in.,
for quarto, the width being measured from the back of the book. Where

plates have to be folded, the fold should be 12-5 cm., or 5 in., from the

stitching in octavo, and 20"5 cm., or 8^ in., in quarto papers. Any folding

plate should, when referred to elsewhere than in the opposite page of

letterpress, have a blank s-psLce equal to the breadth of the paper page at

the left hand, so that when open it can be referred to without closing the

portion of the book being read that refers to it. This should be carried

out even when the diagram or plate would not otherwise have to be folded,

in order to reduce the trouble of reference.

     Each article should begin a page. If possible it should begin a right-
hand page. It is then possible to bind up any article with others on the
same subject without having also to bind up the last half page of another
paper. This difficulty can be overcome to some extent by splitting the
paper. The pages of some of the journals abstracted in the ' Proceedings

of the Physical Society ' are split, one side being sent to each abstractor.

--Comparison of Marpieiic Standards. Interim Report of the Commit-

    tee, consisting of Professor A. W. RtJCKER (Chairman) , Mr. W.

    Watson (Secretary), Professor A. Schuster, and Professor H. H.

     Turner, ajji^ointed to confer v:ith the Astronomer Royal and, the
     Sujjeriidendents of other Ohservatories with reference to the Com-
     parison of Magnetic Standards, tvith a view of carrying out such-
      Comparison.

Professor Rucker and Mr. Watson have carefully compared three Kew-

pattern magnetometers in order to investigate the causes of the discre-

pancies between the measurements of declination made with them. They
                                                                    -

--80 REPORT 1895.

find that if the greatest care be taken in the manufacture of the wooden
box and the metalUc adjuncts which are close to the magnet the discre-

pancies disappear.

     In other words, the cause of the difficulty, in these three instruments

at all events, is, not the metal base, but the much smaller masses of metal

which are nearer to the magnet.

    The three magnetometers are now in good accord.

   A week has been spent at each of four observatories for the purpose

of comparing one of these magnetometers and a dip-circle with the obser-

vatory instruments. Professor Riicker made the observations at Kew

and Falmouth ; Mr. "Watson, those at Stonyhurst and Valentia.
     The greater part of the work which the Committee undertook has thus

been accomplished.

     It is still necessary to compare the instruments again witli the instru-

ments at Kew to ascertain that they are unaltered by transfer from one

place to another ; and as a new magnet-house is about to be built at

Greenwich, it has been thought better to postpone the comparisons at

that observatory until the house is ready for use.

The reductions of the observations which have been made are not yet

Afinished.    full report will be made when the work is completed.

The Committee therefore ask to be reappointed, but no further grant

is required.

--The Amplication of PJiotography to the Elucidixtion of Meteorological
     Phenomena. Fifth Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr,
     G. J. Symons (Chairman), Professor R. Meldola, Mr. J.
    HOPKIXSOX, and Mr. A. W. Clavden (Secretary). (Drawn xip by

       the Secretary.)

In the report which the Committee presented last year, it was proposed
that an agreement should be entered into with the London and South
"Western Railway Company for the use of a site on their land, in order to
carry out some measurements of cloud altitudes by means of photography.

     This has been done. The cameras have been placed in position, and
almost the whole time at the disposal of the secretary for such purposes

has been spent in perfecting the electrical connection for releasing the
two shutters simultaneously. Considerable trouble has been experienced
in doing this. The appai'atus, which worked admirably over a short dis-
tance, proved unreliable over the greater distance (200 yards) at present

adopted. The agreement with the railway company provides that the
connecting wire shall be removed when not in actual use, thereby
necessitating as light a wire as can be made to suffice, which of coui'se
implies a considerable resistance. The result is that a more sensitive

electric detent is required for the shutters, especially as it seems not

unlikely that the distance may have to be increased by another 100 yards
when the measurement of the highest varieties of cloud is attempted.

This is still engaging the attention of the secretary to the Committee.

     Some observations have been made, but although they confirm the
belief that the method will prove valuable they have not yet been reduced
to actual measurements. It .should be remembered that the method is
only applicable to those varieties of cloud which are visible at the same
time as the sun, and that the opportunities of making observations cannot

course of a short time such as that which has elapsed since the cameras

                         was marked for about 13 seconds. During 26 seconds it showed

--Shock 1,37G. At first this was slow, but became stronger after 3 minutes 12 seconds,

                        when for the next 30 seconds it was pronounced.

                 IT. Observations with Horizontal Pendulums.

      In the years 1883, 1884, 1885, 1887, 1888, 1892, and 1893 I embodied
in Reports to the Association some account of work which had been
 carried out in Japan in the investigation of earth tremors or pulsations
 and earth tilting. The Twelfth Report (1892) describes a pair of exti'emely
 light horizontal pendulums the movements of which were recorded on
 photographic plates or films, and gives some account of the analysis of
 the resulting records. The observations were continued during the
 following year, and, as stated in the Thirteenth R,eport (1893), it was
 observed that the direction of earth-tilting movement and also of earth-
 quake movement in the majority of cases coincided with the direction in
 which strata have been folded to form mountain ranges bordering the
 Tokio plain. Anotlier observation was that certain earthquakes had been
 preceded by an abnormal amount of tilting.

      In consequence of the liberality of the Royal Society of London dur-
 ing the last year I have been enabled to extend these observations, usin^

 six horizontal pendulums, each provided with photographic recording

 apparatus.

     The places of observation have been in Tokio, at my house, on a massive

 stone column, and at a place about 1,000 feet distant in an underground
 chamber on a concrete bed ; at Kanagawa, in an artificial cave driven in a
 soft tuff rock at a depth of 50 feet below its junction with 50 feet of over-
 lying alluvium ; at Yokohama, in a cave driven at the junction of the tuff
 and alluvium ; and at Kamakura, in a cave in the tuff which at this j^lace
 is hard and dips at an angle of 30" X.E. All these places lie from Tokio

 myon a S.S.E. line, and are respectively 20, 23, and 38 miles distant from
 house. At Kanagawa and at my house there is only one instrument, and

 the booms of these pendulums point N.W. At the other stations two
 instruments have been or are now being used, and these are placed at

  right angles to each other, one pointing N.W., or parallel to the strike of

 the rocks, and the other N.E., or parallel to the dip. At Kamakura
 observations were made for two and a half months, when the instruments
 were brought to Yokohama. At this latter place, owing to a series of

  accidents, one of which was the collapse of the roof of the cave, up to the

 present the observations have been extremely few. At Kanagawa,

  although the cave is wet, the observations have been fairly continuous.

 In Tokio, where I am able to see the instruments every day, but few inter-

  ruptions have occurred. The chief part of this report, therefore, refers te
  Kamakura and Tokio.

                                              (a) 2'he Instruments.

     Although pendulums made of pieces of aluminium wire and held up
with quartz fibres with their mirrors and lenses have given excellent
results, the apparatus required good installation and careful manipulation.
As tliese requirements were not obtainable, excepting in Tukio, before

commencing observations in the country my first task was to design an

instrument of a simple character, not easily put out of order, and which
would give continuous records for at least one week. This was done, and
as the six instruments which have been made have worked satisfactorily
I give the following desci'iption of one of them.

                                                                   Fig. 1.

screws having a millimetre pitch), the correspouding deflection of the pen-

dulum may be noted. The turning is done by a lever projecting from the

head of the screw.

     The boom of the pendulum is an aluminium tube 4 feet (120 cm.) in

length, carrying a sliding weight, W, and a movable point to which the

suppoi'ting tie can be attached. This tie, which is of thin brass wire, at

its upper end terminates with about an inch of untwisted silk. On the

inner end of the boom there is a quartz cup which bears on a steel needle
projecting slightly upwards from the base of the cast-iron stand. The

suggestion that the needle should project from the stand rather than from
the boom is due to Dr. von Rebeur-Paschvvitz. It gets over the difficulty

of having anything which may be markedly magnetic in motion ; and

secondly, in case of violent disturbance, the relative verticality of the

points of support is less liable to alteration.

     The instrument is adjusted so that the needle bears normally on the

centre of the quartz cup, or so that the centre of gravity of the system

falls about G.

     At the outer end of the boom a stiff wire rises vertically upwards.

Clamped to this at the required height is a horizontal wire 15 cm. long,
carrying a thin zinc plate ji^, measuring 6 cm. l)y 10 cm. In the centre of

this, and parallel to the length of the boom, there is a slit about O'O mm.
broad and 2 cm. long. As the boom moves to the right and left, this slit

floats over a second slit about 5 cm. long in the lid of the box covering
the drum which carries the recording paper. These two slits are at right
angles to each other, so that the liglit from a lamp reflected downwards
by a plane inirror only reaches the drum as a spot.

   A well-defined spot, which means a clear, shares line on the plioto-

graphic film, can be obtained without fine adjustment. That is to say,
the distance between the film and the slit, or between the stationary and

moving slits, may be anything between 1 and 5 mm. Projecting an inch
or so beyond the moving plate and attached to it is a pointer moving

over a scale fixed on the cover of the box containing the clock of the
recording drum. This can be inspected and the position of the boom at
any time noted by looking through tiie glass plate at in.

     The recording drum, on which the photograph -paper is fixed with a
spring clamp, as in a recording barometer, is of thin sheet brass 5 cm.
wide and lOo cm. in circumference (some are much less). It is turned at
the rate of lo cm. per 21 hours, and a film therefore lasts one week.

     The clocks, which are an American type intended to run 8 days,
have fitted to the slowest moving arbour four wheels, the last of which
turns a disc with slots round its edges once a week. The recording
drum, which can be dropped into its bearings, carries a large crank.

When in position the clock is slid in a groove until one of the slots catches

the outer end of the crank arm ; after this the cover is put over the clock
and drum, and the whole is pushed on grooves into the end of the case
covering the pendulum.

     Hollow wooden drums, which are easily driven by the clock-work,

have a tendency to warp, and this may result in a want of uniformity in

the motion.

     Brass drums in the damp atmosphere of a cave in a month or so tend
to rust, and this rust may act upon the photographic film to such an

extent as to render it illegible.
      U]p to the present time ordinary kerosene lamps have been used, but
ox THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC THENOMENA OF JAPAN. 87

as they require attention at intervals of from 8 to 1 2 hours they are being
replaced by lamps such as are used in magnetic observations burning

benzine.

     Every day from 12 noon to 1 p.m. the lamps are removed and a reading
is taken, so that time intervals are marked on the photographs and scale

values are obtained.

     It does not seem necessary that the boom should be made of alumi-
nium, as I obtain what appear to be equally satisfactory records witli booms
of brass or even wood. The most delicate pendulum I have has a booui made
of varnished bamboo with brass fittings. It is about 5 feet in length, and
when last rated had a period of 55 seconds. I say last rated because I
find that this pendulum, like all others I work with, changes its period, and
therefore its sensitiveness, from week to week. I notice tliat this source of
error when computing results is also found in the infinitely better con-
structed and Ijetter installed apparatus used by Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz.

    When the pendulum has its 55-second period one millimetre deflec-

tion on the photographic plate is equivalent to a tilt of 0'08 second of arc.

With this degree of sensitiveness a 141b. weight placed on the column,

which is old and massive, at a distance of 2 feet from the instrument

Mycauses a deflection of 0'5 mm.       weight on the floor ut the outer end of

the boom produces no visible eflfect.

In this condition the pendulum is, however, often too sensitive, as it

will, from time to time, wander an inch or so to the right or left of its

Amean position, and the spot of light fall outside the film.  sensitiveness

of 1 mm. motion per 0"'5 arc is usually quite sufiicient, and I do not think

that apparatus like those of Wolf, d'Abbadie, Darwin, or von Rebeur-

^^Paschwitz capable of recording tilting of from -j^^ to      of a second

could be used on the alluvium of Tokio even when installed on a con-

crete bed underground.

Such apparatus might, however, be used on the solid rock which crops

out round the Tokio j^lain.

    An attempt to test the accuracy of one of the horizontal pendulums

was made by placing it on an ii'on plate resting on a plank 18 in. broad,

1| in. thick, which in turn rested on supports near its end 6 feet apart.
It was then adjusted, so that trials with the test screw indicated that turns

of 10° gave an average deflection of 11' 5 mm.

Side by side with the pendulum a transit instrument having a good

telescope was placed, and this read on a scale fixed on a brick wall at a

distance of 720 feet. The supporting plank was then loaded at its middle
until the telescope showed a deflection of 14 in. on the scale and the

pointer of the pendulum moved 93 mm. From this it seems that the

pendulum indicated a tilt of 1 in 562, while the angular tilt of the

telescope was 1 in 616.

     These are the means of a series of experiments, and assuming that the
readings tlirough the telescope were correct, then the pendulum indications

are about 10 per cent, below their true values. On the other hand,

assuming that the readings through the telescope were one inch too small,

and it was difficult to read within that quantity, then tlie pendulum

Aindications are 2-3 per cent, short of their true value.  great source of

error no doirbt resides in the test screw of the pendulum.
     The instrument described will be recognised by those engaged in

similar in^'estigations as coarse in construction, roughly approximate in

its records, and because it is large as being in all probability subject to
88 REPORT--1895.

convection currents, unequal heating in its parts, and other interferences.

In spite of these objections, I find it satisfactory. It is cheap, easily put

up to read from 1'' to 0"'5, easily worked, while the light is near the film,

and therefore in the best position to use with ordinary bi'omide paper.

    With more delicate apjsaratus, on the Tokio plain at least, no matter

what the size of the foundations might be, the results of my experiments

show that such insti'uments continually require i-eadjustment in order to

keep the light on a film of manageable breadth, while if installed on the

rocks in the mountains I fancy that, owing to earthquakes or the gradual

yielding of the column, there would be a constant change in the mean-

ing of the deflections. In two of my pendulums I notice that sometimes

they gradually become more sensitive and sometimes less sensitive.

The columns I am using underground are of brick, 2 ft. high and 2 ft.

square, jiut together with pure cement. On the top of these, at first, I

placed  a  slab of  marble                                           but because  I  noticed  that  in  a  damp  atmo-
                                                                  ;

sphere there was a marked chemical action taking place between the brass

screws and the stone on which they rested, the marble has been replaced

by slate.

                    (h) Observations at Kamahura.

     Kamakura, one of the ancient capitals of Japan, lies on the western

side of tlie Miura Peninsula, facing the Pacific Ocean. On account of its

ancient temples and its enormous bronze Buddha it is visited by almost
all travellers to Japan. The geologist has an interest in visiting this

place, as it has been the site of a series of earthquakes, which, with their
accompanying sea waves on more than one occasion, are said to have laid

waste a city of a million jjeople. The place is prettily situated amongst
Tertiaiy hills which rise to heights of from 100 to 600 feet around the
plain on which the ancient capital stood. The cliff-like faces of these
hills show a series of conformable beds dipping about 30° N.E. These
beds, which are soft grey coloured clay stones or beds of consolidated
ashes, are from a few inches to a few feet in thickness, and are traversed
by numerous small faults the throw of which, so far as I have observed,
does not exceed six feet. Near to the temples, caves have been excavated,
which are used as shrines ; while similar but smaller caves have been
made by farruers, and are used as storehouses.

    The general relationship of the strata at Kamakura to the alluvium
and diluvium overlying tufi" at Yokohama and Tokio is shown in the ac-

companying section.

                                                                     Fig. 2.

     At Kamakura tlie tuffs are crushed and faulted, but before reaching
Yokohama they pass into gentle folds, and then become horizontal and are

capped with some fifty feet of reddish earth and gravel. This condition,
with the exception that the overburden is perhaps 100 feet in thickness,
continues up to Tokio.

t At Yokohama the tuffs, which almost entirely consist of a light grey
        ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 89

coloured clay rock, are visible as cliffs from 50 to 80 feet in height. In
Tokio, however, they only crop out at one or two places at the bottom
of deep cuttings. The depressions in the section represent the flood

plains of rivers which are tilled with soft alluvium.
     Rather than working on strata which had been so far crushed and

crumpled that further yielding is hardly to be expected, I should have
preferred a site yn the strata which are gently folded, and where a

measurable amount of yielding may yet be in operation.
     Although I had the choice of several caves as Kamakura, all of them

·were situated at some distance from the railway. To go and return from
the one I selected took six hours, and it was therefore seldom that it was
visited more than once a week. Very fortunately I received assistance
from Mr. P. E. Heerman, a gentleman who happened to be staying in the
neighbourhood, while one of tJie officials from the railway station kept the
lamps burning, and three times a day took readings of the instruments.
That the latter was attended to regularly was shown by a slight change in
the intensity of the photographic trace at the times when the lamps were
adjusted, a gap when they wei-e removed to be refilled and a slight notch
in the diagram from a self-recording tliermometer at the times when the
doors of the cave were opened, and the times at which these various marks
were made coincided with the times at which the readings were noted as

having been made.
      The cave seems to have been excavated on the line of a fault which,

curiously enough, is with difficulty recognisable on the face of the cliff
itself, but which is quite apparent in a photograph. The entrance to the
cave, which faces S.E., was, with the exception of the door, blocked up
with a wooden wall faced on the outside with a bank of earth and rubble
work 4 feet in thickness. The dimensions of the cave were 20 feet by
 20 feet, with a heiglit cf from 7 to 10 feet. One corner of this was
partitioned off with wooden walls to form a room 10 feet square, and
from this the debris was cleared out to reach the solid rock on which two

 brick platforms were built.

     These were one brick thick and laid with pure cement. On the end

--of each of these platforms, which were at right angles to each other one
--running N.W. and the other N.E. a small pillar three bricks high and

one brick square was built and capped with a slab of mai'ble. These
 were finished on January 7, and the cave was left open for one week to

facilitate the drying. At the end of that time, on January 14, as the

 cement appeared to have set, the instruments were placed on the slabs

 and the records commenced. From that date, with but few interruptions
 continuous photographic traces were obtained until March 18. These
 machines I have called C and D. Machine C recorded tilting parallel to

Dthe strike, while recorded movements parallel to the dip. By a lifting

 on the S.E. side the readings of the index attached to C increased in value,

 Dwhile the readings of increased with a lifting on the S,W. side.

      At the end of each week, when a photographic film was renewed, the

 sensitiveness of the instrument was determined, after which it was re-
 adjusted. These determinations are given in the following table. The

 ratio of unity to the numbers in the first two columns is the tangent of the

 angle through whicli tlie instrument would have to be tilted to 23roduce

 a deflection on the photographic trace of one millimetre ; the corresponding

 angles in seconds of arc are given in the third and fourth columns. At

 the commencement it will be obsei'ved that to produce a deflection of one
--90 REPORT 1895.

millimetre in C a tilt of about 2" would be required. Between February

IS and 25 the same deflection was obtained by a tilt of about 0"-27.

 imagined that between February 28 and March 3 the dip of the rocks
increased and then decreased through an angle of 4"-0S. About the same
 time the movement at right angles to this was 2"-88. With the exception
 of a wave indicated by C between February 6 and 7, which had a period of
 I'i hours, all the other movements have had periods of from 48 to 70
 hours. In this respect the movements are strikingly different from those
 recorded in Tokio, where diurnal waves are very frequent. Another
 remarkable feature in the records is the entire absence of tremors, which
 in Tokio on the alluvium often result in producing a photographic trace from
 .5 to 10 millimetres, and sometimes even more than this, in breadth (Plate
 II., figs. 5 and 6). Although it is premature to offer an explanation for the
Kamakura movements the following statement may be made. As the

 changes in temperature in the cave were usually too small to be measur-
 able it is not likely that the wandering of the pendulums can be attributed

to such a cause. Any effect that the heat of the sun may have had upon

 the face of the cliff in which the cave is situated, in raising its tempera-
 ture or by v/ithdrawing moisture from its surface, would probably be
diurnal in its character. The only sunshine records which I have taken

commence on February 25. From that day to February 28 there were 28
hours of sunshine which was followed by dull weather until March 11.

Although the end of the period of sunshine was followed by a great move-
ment, considerable movements occurred during the comparatively cloudy
weather. Because the records are few this observation, however, cai-ries but
little weight. Rain, which only fell between February 8 and 9, and again
between March 5 and 6, does not show any connection with the movements.
Notwithstanding these observations, since the wandering of pendulums in
Tokio, as will be shown later, is apparently connected with the movement
of subterranean water, which in turn is related to percolation from the

surface, it does not seem unlikely that the movements at Kamakura may

also find a partial explanation in a somewhat similar cause. The only

other explanation, which, however, has not yet been verified, is that they
result from rock crumpling which is still in progress, and for this reason
the greatest motion is parallel to the dip.

      Conclusions of practical importance which I arrive at are that although
pendulums which will record a tilting of 0"-3 are sufficiently sensitive to

be used on the Tokio plain, an instrument of much greater sensibility is
required to study movements on the rock, and, further, that all who have

to carry out physical investigations requiring a steady platform will gain

great advantage by installations on the rock where tilting is small and
diurnal movements and tremors are not appreciable to instruments such

as I have employed.

                                                  (e) Earthquakes.

     The earthquakes which have been recorded by the Kamakura instru-

ments in 1893 are as follows :
     The following 26 disturbances are clearly shown upon the photographic

traces. In addition to these there are a number of slight irregularities with
amplitudes of 1 mm., or under, which have been omitted, first, because
they are very small, and secondly, because they might or might not be due
to earth disturbances. While the observations were going on, that is,
between January 14 and March 18, by means of seismographs in Tokio, 21
shocks were recorded. These were disturbances that were felt in Tokio, and
it is known that several of them were also felt in Kamakura. It is probable

hour 47 minutes. These waves liad a submarine origin about 40 miles off

Ethe N.E. corner of Yezo, in about 43^ N. lat. and 140° long., and to reach

Tokio had travelled some 570 miles. I think that they have been recorded
in Rome, and I have written to Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz to learn
whether they were noted at Potsdam, Wilhelmshaven, and Strassburg.
They ought to have reached the Birmingham iiastrurnent about midday on
March 22.

    While I am writing in Sapporo (Yezo), on June 20, at 2.-32 p.m., a
terrible earthquake has happened in Yokohama and Tokio. As we are

9 hours E. of Greenwich this should be recorded at the above stations?
and those in Russia at about 6.30 a.m. on the same day.

     From the manner a pendulum behaves I infer that its movements are-

due to the fact that it is being tilted, and because the photographic records
are always less than the distances through which I have seen it move, the-

values given for the tilting are less than those which actually happened.
If a pendulum is set swinging, for example, by standing near its column,
thi'ough a distance of, say, 5 mm., it will come to rest in about 5 minutes.

In calculating the duration of a disturbance allowance has been made for

this factor.

      The point of greatest importance in connection with the foregoing
remarks is the inference that the catalogue of Kamakura earthquakes
represents a series of large disturbances which have travelled very great

distances. Had there been any local disturbances sufficiently great to

 produce earth waves, then the pendulums must have recorded the same,

but no such disturbances occurred. As it is not likely that earthquakes
originating at a distance could in any way be connected Avith local tilting,

if earthquakes and tilting have any connection those which might be
 compared with the curves already given are those of local origin which
 have been recorded by seismographs in the vicinity, and not those which
 are shown on the photographic films. Between January 24 and March 18
 lifteen shocks were noted in Tokio, which cannot be seen on the photo-
 graphic traces. Because nearly all these were of the nature of elastic
 vibrations it is probable that they were for the most part of local origin.
 This is a point which can only be definitely settled by analysing the reports
 accumulated at the Meteorological Bureau, which for various reasons
 cannot be done in time for the present report. These 1 5 shocks are indicated
 on the curves as black dots, and it is certainly woi'th observing that they
 chiefly occur during the seventh, eighth, and ninth weeks when tilting was-

 marked. Because the observations are few and because I am not yet in a

 po-sition to analyse all the materials which have been accumulated, too great
 stress should not be laid upon this last observation. It only indicates the
 nature of an inquiry that is being made.

      The last point to which attention must be called in connection with
 the Kamakura disturbances is that the greatest motion has nearly always

 been in the direction of the dip, that apparently being the direction of

 least resistance to yielding. By reference to the catalogue it will be seen

 that there are three instances where small disturbances have only been
 recorded by C, but in all other cases the records are given by both instru-
 ments, the dip record being much the larger, or the record has been given

 Dby alone. For example on February 8 D was tilted for 30 minutes

 through an angle of nearly 7", while C did not show that any motion

 had taken place.

(/) The Observations in Tokio.

     Although tlie observations made in Tokio were carried on at two
stations, because these stations were only 1,000 feet apart, and because

both were on the alluvium which here forms a layer perhaps 100 feet in
thickness above the tuff rock, it was anticipated that the recoi'ds would to
some extent be similar in character. For this reason they are described

together.

     Machine A, which is similar to those used at Kamakura, is installed on

a table-like stone column in my house. The column is 4 feet square and

rises clear of the floor from a concrete bed. For a few hours in the
morning and in the aftei'noon the sun produced a marked tilting as it
shone upon the column through a window on the south side ; on closing
this window by a shutter on the outside and by a curtain on the
inside, this effect disappeared, while the diagram from a self-record-
ing thermometer occasionally showed during 24 hours a steady rise or

a steady fall of 1° or 2° C. More usually, however, the diagram showed
that from 9 or 10 a.m. until 5 or G p.m. there had been a rise of 4°
or 5° C, after which the temperature fell until next morning. This is
a point to be noted, because it will be shown that the daily tilting and,
in a less marked degree, the intensity of a tremor storm have a similar

periodicity.

    The water level beneath my house oscillates above and below 3G

feet.

   AMachines E and F, which are underground, only differ from in the

Afact that their booms are brass tubes. Machines and F are parallel to
Aeach other, and point N.W. Machine E is at right angles to and F.

AWith an increase in the readings of or F the u\ovement corresponds to

Ana lifting of the ground on the N.E. side of these instruments.

Eincrease in the scale readings of  corresponds to a tilting on the S.E.

.side.

     The underground chamber is excavated on a flat piece of ground about

20 feet below the site of my house. It is 13 feet deep and 20 feet square.

The floor is covered with \ in. of asphalt, which rests on a bed of concrete
6 in. thick, which in turn rests on a bed of well-rammed gravel. Tlie
walls and ceiling ai'e brick with clay puddle on the outside. Above the
chamber a wooden house has been built ; the entrance is by double doors,
and it is fairly well ventilated by gratings for the admission of air and a
short iron chimney for its exit. The daily fluctuations in temperature
in this underground room are practically zero, the diagram from a self-
recording thermometer showing a sti'aight line which at present indicates
a steady rising of 1° C. per week. The water level in a well about 80
yards distant, where I have established a tide gauge, is about 25 feet below
the surface. The floor of the chamber is therefore about 1 2 feet above
water level, but it must be remembered that this level may rise and fall

through 2 or 3 feet.

                                {g) Sensitiveness of tlie Instruments.

    From time to time the sensitiveness of the instruments was determined,

and if necessary they were readjusted.
     The first column in the accompanying table indicates the number of

millimetres through which the end of the boom travelled by a 1° turn of

the sensitising screw in the bed plate, the pitch of the screw being 1 mm.

AOne complete turn of the screw attached to tilted the bed plate of this

instrument through an angle of 1 in 228. For E and F one complete turn

represented an angle of 1 in 222.
     The ratio of unity to the numbers in the second and fourth columns is

the tangent of the angle corresponding to a deflection of the boom through
a distance of 1 mm., the values of these angles expressed in seconds of arc
being given in the third and fifth columns.

                                                                         E and F

periods o£ steadiness when the diagrams were practically straight lines
happened at the same time, and because the large or small movements of

A have agreed in time with the large or small movements recorded ):)y E.

As illustrative of this synchronism, the movements of these instruments

between February 15 and February 25 have been plotted as curves (see

Plate IV.).

     Once or twice it will be observed that crests of waves have been
reached after midnight or in the morning, which agrees with the results
published in 1893 (Thirteenth Report). In the majority of instances,
however, this has been reversed, and the movement of the pendulum in
one direction has been completed at any time between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m.,
and it has returned to its original position between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m.
Because the waves on the original diagrams are long and flat it is usually
difficult to determine with any accuracy the exact time at which an
excursion in any one direction has been completed. Sometimes the boom
has remained at rest at one of its limits for five or six hours before the
return journey has been commenced. The movement from 5 or 10 a.m.
until 4 or 10 p.m. has nearly always been quicker than the return motion

during the night.

     The amplitude of motion does not seem ever to have exceeded 3''-00.
In 1893 I described movements of from 2"'00 to 10'''00 ; but these which
I now discuss are the result of observations with several instruments,

although I cannot answer for any great degree of accuracy, I am inclined

to consider the new determinations as being nearer the truth. The move-
ments of E, which is underground, have usually been greater than tliose

A]-ecorded by in my house. In a few instances, however, the deflections
Aof have been the greater.

    As an appendix to the table on p. 97 short abstracts from my journal

are added :

         (i) Extract from Journal of Records obtained in 1894.

In the following extracts the sensitiveness of the instruments means

the angular tilting required to produce a deflection of one millimetre of

the points at the end of the booms. These degrees of sensitiveness for

the instruments E, A, and F are given in fractions of seconds of arc-

immediately after the date.

A6 P.M. on the 24th to 4 p.m. on the 25th : on and F they reach about

5 ram.

The earthquake of the 24th is not shown.

February '2&-March 1 (0"-43, 0''-25, 0"'26).

EThe daily curves on are marked, but they are irregular. The shock

of the 27th occurs just over the crown of the daily wave, which was at

10 P.M. The ci-est of this tilting, both in time and amplitude, was unusual.

   AOn and F the daily curves are slight ; on A, like E, they are

irregular.

   ATremors of 2 or 3 mm. are shown on and F on the 26th, 6 to 7 p.m.;

27th, 6 A. to 4 p. ; and on the 28th, 6 a. to 1 p. The last are visible

on E.

    F wanders by a N.E. sinking through 10 mm. On March 1 the

direction of motion commenced to change, that is, there was a N.E. lifting.

    March 1-5 (0"-43, 0"-25, 0"-26).-- On E the daily curves are large,

but at unusual times.

   A shows slight daily curves, but a N.E. lifting of 10 mm. F shows a

N.E. lifting of 22 mm.

E, but not with F, which shows slight tremors, March 1, from 9.30 a. to

    On the 15th, and at 3 a.m. on the 18th, there were earthquakes.

ADuring the three days rose 9 mm. F does not show daily curves, but

it rose 39 mm.

The conclusions I arriv^e at respecting this section of the i^eport is,

that instruments on the sui-face and underground show diurnal move-

ments, which closely agree in the times at which they occur. These move-

ments are most pronounced underground by pendulum E, the excursions

of which have in nearly all instances been greater than those shown by

Apendulum in my house. The crest of a wave which corresponds to a
AN.E. lifting on
                  and a S.E. lifting on E has usually been reached

between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m., the movement in the opposite direction being

completed between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. It does not seem that air temperature

has had any measurable effect in the production of these movements, because

they have been most marked beneath the surface, where the change in

temperature during twenty-four hours has practically been zero. The

opportunities for observing whether they hold any relationship with rain-

fall have been few. It is possible that the rainfall of March 16 and 17

Amay have been connected with the large motions of between March 16

and 18, but the largest motions of E on March 1 and 2 occurred during a

dry period. After the rainfall of January 25 and 26, and again after

that of Februaiy 8 and 9, it may be noticed that the time at which E

completed its N.W. excursion was delayed, while after that of March 16

Aand 17 pendulum was delayed in its N.E. movement, and these are the

only occasions on which rain fell in any quantity.

                {j) The Wandering of the Pendulums.

The following table shows the daily change which has taken place in

the position of the pointer of pendulum A, and for a few days that which

has taken place with pendulums F and E. The numbers indicate so many

+millimetres of motion. The sign       prefixed indicates that the scale

--i-eadings were increasing, while the sign indicates that they weie

Abecoming smaller. When the signs for and F are similar, then these

two pendulums were moving in the same direction. The difference

between the readings of an instrument when a new film was put on and

when it was taken off gives the distance through which a boom has been

displaced during periods of three or four days : this quantity is also ex-

pressed in seconds of arc. The fifth column gives the rainfall in milli-

metres, and the sixth the number of hours of sunsliine, but only between

February 25 and AjDril 30. These latter records were taken for me
by my colleague, Prof. W. K. Burton.

on the surface, while in six cases it has been less than that on the surface.
These instances are taken from the three or four clay periods. If the

analysis was made for daily periods, the difference between the amount
of motion recorded underground and that recorded on the surface would
be yet more marked. Whenever the movements of the surface instrument

A have been great, exceeding 1" in seven instances, its direction of

motion has corresponded with the direction of movement of the instru-
ment which is placed in a parallel direction F. In two cases the directions,

Aof movement between and F have been opposite to each other. When,
Ahowever, the movements of have been small or less than 1" the cases of

agreement and of disagreement in direction of motion are practically
equal, there being 6 of one and 11 of the other. For January, February,,
and March rainfall seems to have been followed by considerable dis-
turbances underground, the movements during dry periods being compara-
tively small. The instrument on the surface has, however, shown several
marked exceptions to the latter rule, its pointer having moved from 8 to

12 mm. (2" to 3") at least five times when the displacement could not be

attributed to the saturation of the soil.

     During April and May, although a considerable amount of rain fell,
the movements of the underground instruments were small, but it must be
remembered that during these months percolation was in all probability
very small as compared with that of January, February, and March.
Instrument A, on the contrary, showed on several occasions very large
movements between April 13 and 14, moving as much as 30 mm. or 6", and
from what has gone before it is not necessary to assume that these dis-
turbances were directly connected with rainfall.

    Up to the date of writing this report I have not been able to obtain,

from the Meteorological DejDartment factors which enable me to make

any accurate estimate of the ratio of percolation to evaporation, but it

may be taken, as a general rule, that percolation and the fluctuations in

height of subterranean water are greater during the winter montlis than
they are during the summer, and if the instruments partly owe their move-
ments to movements of underground water, these movements ought to be
most pronounced in winter, and this seems to have been the case. Since the

commencement of May, up to June 6, E and F have wandered but little, the

diagrams being fine straight lines like fig. 1, Plate II., and without tremors.
It must also be observed that it has been the instruments in the under-
ground chambers within 1 2 feet of water level which have moved the most..

     To throw additional light upon the part that subterranean water may

have played in influencing the motion of the pendulums the following
experiments were made :

      1. The movements of water in an unused well were recorded.

    A2. rough measurement of the rate at which moisture was evaporated!

from ground near to one of the instruments was made.

    A3. well near to one of the instruments was twice emptied of its

water.

                               (k) Moveiiients of Water in a Well.

     From April 18 until June 8, I established a tide gauge in an unused

well 80 yai'ds to the east of the underground chamber. It consisted of
a large M'ooden float carrying a bamboo mast 30 feet in length, the top of
which projected through a hole in a lid which covered the top of the well.

As the mast rose and fell a pencil in contact with a sheet of paper on a drum
ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. lO-S

recorded the motion. The diagrams obtained indicate the following facts.

Very shortly after heavy rain the well commences to rise, and the rising

continues for three or four days after the rain has ceased. The upward

motion, which at times has been as much as 7 or 8 inches in 2-i hours, even-

tually becomes slower for about two days, after which the water falls slowly.

A more important observation, however, is that during any 24 hours

there are fluctuations in the rate of rising or falling which when the well

is nearly steady are distinct, but when the coming up or going down of

Athe water is rapid they are barely visible,  number of these daily

fluctuations are shown on Plate IV. About midnight and for some hours

afterwards the water is at its highest, and it is again high during the

middle of the day. It is lowest in the evening and the early morning,
which is the time when the greatest quantity of water is being drawn

from wells throughout the city. The nearest well from Avhich water is

drawn to the one in which the gauge is established is on tlie east side,

about 60 yai'ds distant.

In the following table the dates refer to the interval between noon of

one day to noon of the succeeding day. The figures in the columns

indicate the hours at which the well commenced to sink and then to rise

in the afternoon and evening, and when it again commenced to sink and

to rise in the morning. The time midway betM^een the rising in the

evening and the sinking in the morning may be taken as the crest of the

night wave, the crest of the midday wave being halfway between the

A.M. rising and the p.m. sinking of the next day. The omission of dates

or hours indicates that the inflections on the diagram were indistinct or

absent. The letters R, F, or S in the sixth column indicate whether the

well was rising, falling, or steady.

The time at which the well commences to rise in the evening is

fairly constant, about 8 p.m. This precludes the idea that the diurnal

motion may be dependent upon the tides in the neighbouring bay,

which is some two miles distant. The most irregular figures are those

indicating the time at which the well commences to sink in the morning,

which as summer approaches, when the city rises at an earlier hour, also

tends to become earlier, and therefore assist in confirming the suggestion,

that the rising and falling of the water are due to the facts that larger

quantities of water are being used in the morning and evening than are

being used during the middle of the day and the middle of the niglit.

The amount of these fluctuations has seldom exceeded 5 mm., and

the day and night waves have about the same amplitudes. Professor

Franklin H. King found that a heavily loaded train moving slowly

past a well at a distance of 140 feet caused the water in the well

to slightly rise, from which it might be inferred that the rising and falling^

of water in a well might be accompanied by a rising and sinking of the

surrounding sui'face. If this were the case then during a day and night

the horizontal pendulums in Tokio ought to show a double curve. In

some few instances there is a tendency to show such a double motion, as,

for example, in fig. 5, Plate II. But because one of the curves is faint
and because it is of rare occurrence, the 12-hour movement in the well is

by no means sufficient to explain the daily wave indicated by the pendulums.

It must, however, be reiuarked that the period of well observations coin-

cides with a period when daily curves were not well marked, and what

happened in the well when they were distinctly marked I have at present

no means of ascertaining.

 tion of moisture from and upon various natural surfaces, but I have not
 been able to consult them.

     In open ground 30 per cent, of the rainfall may percolate, but in a
 forest as much as 80 per cent, may find its way downwards, the difierence
being due to evaporation ; but as evaporation may cease or even be re-

 presented by condensation during the night, it would seem that the volume
 of water in surface wells especially on hot days following rainy weather
 might have a daily fluctuation. Such a fluctuation would, however, only
 account for the rising of water during the night and for an additional rise
 about midday.

      Another point to be noted is the fact that the alternations of evapora-
 tion and condensation mean that neighbouring areas, some of which are open
 and others covered with forest every 12 hours, are unequally relieved of
 considerable loads. For example, from an area of about 140 feet square in

front of my house, which faces south, every day during fine weather about

 5 tons of moisture are removed. JTrom the back of the house, which is
 sheltered from the sun, and where the ground is always damp, compara-
 tively but little is evaporated. The underground chamber is sheltered by
 a grove of trees on its south and west sides, and on the east side it is open,

and pendulum E behaves as if a load were removed from the east side

 during the morning and afternoon, and that side of the ground had con-

Asequently risen. Pendulum in my house, where there is an evaporation

 area on the east, south, and partly on the west side, usually behaves
 like E, to which, however, it is at riglit angles.

     By comparing the table of daily waves with the rainy days when there
was no sunshine, when it may be assumed that evaporation was small, as,
for example, between March 8 and 11, it will be observed that the daily

Acurves for and E were not measurable. On sunny days, even if it

 rained, the curves were pronounced, but they were also large on other days,

when, however, evaporation may possibly have been great.

      To settle this question future diagrams must be compared with the
records obtained from a hygrometer exposed to the open or by two pen-
dulums in parallel positions, but on the opposite sides of a piece of forest

land. Two pendulums thvis placed ought at the same time to move in
opposite directions, that is, during the day each boom ought to move

towards the forest.

    An observation entirely opposed to what is here suggested is that made

by Professor Kortazzi at Nicolaiew, who placed a hydrograph in the
cellar where a horizontal pendulum was established, and found that the

diagrams given by the two instruments were very similar. This he
attributed to the stone column carrying the pendulum behaving like a

sponge and absorbing moisture. When the openings to the cellar were

closed and the pillar covered with a waterproof material the effect of

moisture almost entirely disapjjeared.

                         (t)i) Effects produced by emptying a Well.

     To determine what eflfect a slight disturbance of subterranean water

would produce on a horizontal pendulum, on May 21 I employed men to

rapidly empty a well which is 104 feet distant in an E.IST.E. direction from
pendulum A. The well is 42 feet 7 inches deep, 2 feet Tinches in diameter,
and on this particular day it contained 13 feet 1 inch, or about 2 tons of

water.
--lOS REPORT 1895.

     For several days the pointer of the pendulum had been fairly steady,

pointing at division 70 on the scale of millimetres. What happened when

the well was emptied is given in the table below.
     The photographic trace with interruptions in it Avhen the light was

removed is shown in fig. 7, Plate II. The movement of the pointer from
70 to 79 indicates a tilt of l"-36 and the direction of motion was as if a.
load had been taken away on the well side, and the ground on that side
had therefore risen. This may be explained by the fact that as the water
came to the surface it was run into a gutter to flow away quickly down a

hill. The pendulum remained between 77 and 82 until May 27, when the

experiment was repeated. It started at 80, and in 6 hours and 40 minutes
it reached 86, and here it has remained with a tendency to get higher but

not to return.

large that earthquakes have not occurred. The tremor storms which were
numei'ous in tlie early j^art of the year have no doubt obliterated many of
the unfelt earthquakes to which tlie pendulums were sensitive. Notwith-
standing this, there are a considerable number of disturbances on the
traces, the record of which must be left for a future report. The most
remarkable of these was recorded by pendulum F, which at the time was
steady and producing a clear sharp straight line (see fig. 3). This was
on June 3, when at 4.36 p.m. the pendulum commenced to move from side
to side, and, with the exception of two or three intervals of about five
minutes, it continued to move until 10 P.M. Although 14 points of

maximum may be counted, the photograph represents what is practically

a continuous earthquake of 5 hours 24 minutes' duration. The picture is
that of a series of small flat cones, each inverted, with their axes in one

straight line. No displacement of the pendulum took place, and after the

                                                                    Fig. 3.

disturbance it continued to draw the same thin line. I do not know
where this or the other unfelt earthquakes originated. The rate at which
the decided movements are propagated is from 2'5 to 4 kilometres per
second, and there are reasons for believing that many of them, like that
of March 22, originated beneath the bed of the ocean.

                                                     (o) Tremors.

      In the extracts from the Journal (pp. 96 to 99) it will be seen that
 tremors or earth pulsations have often been recorded, and that some-
 times these were greater underground than on the surface. During the
 last two months they have been greater on the surface. Previous analyses
 have shown that they nearly always accompany a steep barometric gradient.

 They are sometimes marked when the daily curve is barely visible, but
 small tremors at least usually accompany these waves, and' they are more
 pronounced during the night and early morning, when the rate at which
 a pendulum is being displaced is relatively slow. The fact that small
 tremors were produced at the time the well was emptied is a fact not to
 be overlooked when considering their origin.

      I regret to say that a more careful examination of the tremor records
 must be left for a future report.

                     {p) Observations at Yokohama and Kanagawa.

      As already stated, the instruments at Kanagawa (i) and (g and h) at
 Yokohama are underground, and stand on short brick columns rising from
 soft tuff rock. The softness of this rock may be judged of from the fact that
 when a person stands near one of the columns, the boom of the pendulum is

 deflected from 5 to 17 mm., from which it appears that, as a foundation to
  resist loading eflfects, the tuff rock is no better than a slab of conci-ete on
 the alluvium in Tokio. Owing to the collapse of the roof of the Yoko-

 hama cave, which caused a delay of two weeks, and owing to the fact that

  the clocks have been continually stopping, and good clocks cannot be found
--110 KEPORT 1895.

in Tokio or Yokohama, the records from this place are extremely few.
Those which have been obtained, extending over two or three days, show

straight lines like fig. 1, Plate II. There are neither daily curves nor tremors.

     From Kanagawa, although the cave is very wet and the conditions for
observing very unfavourable, for about two months everything has worked
satisfactorily. Like the Kamakura records they do not show tremors or
daily waves, but they do show unfelt earthquakes and wandering. For

example, on May 5 the boom moved as if by a N.E. tilting as much as
14". This it reached on May 7. From this date it slowly returned to its
starting point, which it reached on May 12. Small shocks occurred on

the 2nd, 4th, and 6th.

                                                    (q) Conclusions.

     Inasmuch as the analysis of materials already accumulated is not yet

completed, and as certain experiments require to be repeated or amplified,
it is premature to formulate definite conclusions. All that can therefore

be done is to outline the form which conclusions may possibly assume.

     Although I understand that Italian observers have found that tremors
are as marked underground, even on the rock, as they are on the surface
in Japan, this seems to be only true for the alluvium. Underground on
the rock at three stations, with such instruments as I have employed,
there has not been even an indication of tremors. Neither have
daily waves been observed. All the pendulums, whether on the rock
or on the alluvium, from time to time leave their normal position,
moving for two or three days in one direction and then slowly returning.
These movements, which have been called wanderings, sometimes indicate

a tilting of as much as 14''. Because these movements have often been
accompanied by local earthquakes, it seems possible that they may

actually represent rock bending, the earthquakes announcing the fact

that resistances to the process are being overcome.

    Some of the wanderings noted on the alluvium may possibly be

attributed to disturbances in the subterranean circulation of water after

rainfall.

     Although the daily movement of the pendulums has been most marked
by those which are nearest to water level, because they only show a single
wave during the day, while the water in a neighbouring well rises and
falls twice during the 24 hours, the daily wave cannot altogether be
attributed to the movement of subterranean water. Because certain
diao-rams have shown a superimposed wave, it is possible that the cha-
racter of the daily wave may now and then be influenced by subterranean
water. Because a wave may be produced by relieving an area in the
vicinity of a pendulum of a load, as, for example, by taking 2 tons of water
out of a well which is 104 feet distant from pendulum A, and pouring the
water away down a slope, it seems likely that the daily wave is produced
by an action of this description. The action suggested is that which
takes place every day when the sun shines or the wind blows across
&<n-ound which is open and that which is covered, for example, by forests or
buildino-s. By evaporation one area is rapidly relieved of a load, while
the adjacent area loses but little. For example, experiment shows that

on fine days an open grass-covered area 140 feet square in front of my

house, which is 120 feet long and runs E. and W., loses in 12 hours about

5 tons of moisture. At the back of the house, where the ground is
sheltered from the sun, evaporation is small. As confirming this view it

Ais observed that pendulum is steady on dull wet days, but on warm
Adays the daily curves are well defined. Farther, although and E move

at the same time, they move in opposite directions, but each usually moves
towards the side from which the greatest load is being removed by

evaporation.

                III. The Tokio Earthquake of June 20, 1894.

    On June 20, at a few minutes past two in the afternoon, Tokio,

Yokohama, and the surrounding districts were shaken by an earthquake
which was more violent than any which has been recorded since 1855.

On June 25 it was reported that in Tokio alone 33,940 buildings had

suffered damage, some being entirely ruined, 140 pei'sons had been

wounded, and that 26 had been killed. In Yokohama, where many

chimneys fell and houses were unroofed, 6 people were killed. When

statistics are completed and it is known what has happened in other

places these numbers will be increased. Small fissures were formed in

the ground at Tokio in 96 places, many walls were shattered, while stone

lanterns and tombstones were overthrown, twisted, or deranged.
     The following facts are taken or deduced from the records obtained at

the Central Observatory and the University Laboratory, both of which are
in Tokio, at a distance of about 1^ mile from each other. To these are
added observations from the Hitotsubashi Observatory, which is situated
on soft ground lying between the Central Observatory and the University,
at which places the ground is comparatively hard.

lives were lost, the maximum accelerationSj calculated on more certain
data, varied between 3,000 and 8,000 millimetres ^5er sec. ^je?' sec. At the

University there is a seismometer, consisting of a number of iron shot,
arranged on a ledge round the top of a strong post, beneath which there
is a bed of sand. These shot were not projected, but all of them, excepting
one on the N.E. side, simply fell. The duration of the disturbance is of
course that given by seismographs. Horizontal pendulums may have been
tilted backwards and forwards for one or two hours. For some time after
the shock it was observed that the Sunida River, which runs through
Tokio, rose and fell as if its bed continued to be agitated. The direction
of motion, as with nearly all earthquakes, was varied, and the direction
given is that which was most pronounced.

     The times at which the commencement of the disturbance was recorded
at places some distance from Tokio are as follows :

my house were visited every day, while those at a distance-- as, for ex-
ample, at Kamakura (C and D)-- were visited at least once a week. Not-

withstanding the time taken in making journeys to the more distant
stations, one of which occupied from ten to twelve hours, because the
clockwork kept going for a week and the lamps burned for two or three
days, it was often possible to keep six instruments working simultaneously.

described in the fourteenth report to this Association. In order to show
the relationship of these observations to those made during the past year
at A, H, I, and the remaining eleven stations, they are briefly referred to

in the following notes.

     The sensibilities of the different instruments which are described in
the Keport for 1894 are indicated by the number of millimetres the end
of the boom was deflected )»y turning one of the screws in the bed plate

one degree. The pitch of a screw was one millimetre, and its distance

from the axis on which the bed plate was tilted may be taken at 220

Amillimetres. All the instruments excepting had usually a sensibility

of 1° for 3 mm., which is approximately equal to a tilting of 1" for each
millimetre of deflection. Occasionally the sensibility was increased two-
fold or threefold. The reason for this indefiniteness respecting sensibility

is that the notes relating to the calibration of the instruments were burned.
The chief value of these determinations is to give angular values for the
diurnal wave, and because it will be shown that this is a quantity with
large variations depending upon locality and weather, the necessity of
accurate measurements becomes more apparent than real.

   --The Pendulum at A. Sensibility, September 26, 1894. 1°:=12 mm.

or 1 mm.=:0""20. This instrument, which was adjusted to have a sensi-
bility twice or six times greater than the other instruments, was installed

in my private observatory on a massive well-built stone column resting

upon a bed of concrete. Towards the east and west it was protected by
60 feet of building, but to the north and south by only about lOfeet. The
only window in the room, whicli was on the south side, was always closed
by a curtain on the inside and a solid shutter upon the outside. The
reason that it was oriented to record N.E. and S.W. motions was because,
as was explained in the last Report, there were reasons for believing that
in such a direction earthquake and other motion had a maximum. The
daily movements were often eclipsed or made indefinite by the occurrence

of tremors. When they were visible, although on one occasion they were

represented by deviations of 8 mm., it was rarely that they exceeded 2 or

3 mm. In many instances it seems that a second wave was superimposed

upon the ordinary diurnal disturbance. Excursions towards the N.E. were
usually completed between 5 and 15 hours, Avhile the S.W. motion ended

--between and 3 hours (tig. 6, p. 134).
    Pendulums at C and D. These were installed upon rock in a ca\e at

Kamakura, about 27 miles distant from the pendulums in Tokio. One of
these recorded motion in the direction of the dip of the strata, and the

other in a direction at right angles to this. Their records are described
in the Report for 1893-94.

   E --Pendtdums at and F. These pendulums were in directions N.E.

and N.AV. or parallel to C and D. The N.W. booms were parallel to A.
The installation was iu an underground chamber, where as at Kamakura

the daily change in temperature was practically unappreciable. These
records are described in the Report for 1893-94.

   -- HPendidums at G and II. The pendulums G and were placed on the

rock in a cave at the Yokohama Brewery. Their orientation corresponded

Dto that of C and or E and F, and their records are referred to in the

above-mentioned Report.

   --Pendidivm at I. This pendulum was in an exceedingly damp cave

at Kanagawa, about three miles distant from G and H. Its boom, like

that of A, pointed towards the north-west. The few records obtained
from this station are described with those of the above-mentioned three

stations.

     This was an aluminium boom which, with its plate and index, had a
total length of about 4 feet 9 inches. Its cast-iron stand rested upon a
slab of slate upon the top of a short brick column, which rose from a layer
118 REPORT--1895.

 of concrete covering a bed of gravel rammed into the natural earth. It
 was covered by a coarse wooden case. The whole arrangement was shel-
 tered by a small wooden hut, 9 feet long and 7 feet broad, and up to the
eaves 6 feet in height. This hut, like all the other huts, admitted so much

 light that the photographic tilms had to be changed at night. Currents of
air came in freely, and, as might be expected, there were considerable

 fluctuations in temperature.

     On the west side the ground was flat and open, and it was also fairly
open towards the north and south. On the east side, however, it was

sheltered by a small hill and trees, behind which came a pond, more trees,
and then instrument K, which had a small tract of open ground upon its

eastern side.

     The westerly motion, which varied from b to 40 mm., usually took
place between 18 or 21 hours and 6 or 9 hours, that is to say, the pendulum
commenced to move towards the west at about 6 or 9 a.m., and continued
this motion until 6 or 9 p.m. (fig. 7). During the night the easterly or i^eturn
motion was gentle, and usually less than the motion towards the west.

     On wet cloudy days no curves were visible.

     Tremors were not marked at this station.

   AComparing the jST.E. and S.W. motions of with the E. and W. motions

at J in li4 instances these movements were completed at about the same
hour. In 21 instances, however, there is a difierence between them of
from 5 to 10 hours.

    An experiment which was made at this station was to dig a trench

round the hut on its south and west sides. This was 5 feet in depth, while
its distance from the column was about 10 feet. The only effect that this
produced upon the daily diagram seems to have been that the points of
inflection in the curve became somewhat sharper, the range of motion of
the pendulum remaining constant.

  --Pendulum at K. Sensibility, September 20, 1894, l°=4-5 mm., or

=1 mm.=0"-50. November 21, 1894, 1° ;3 mm. The installation of

this instrument, excepting the fact that it was exposed to open ground
towards the east and north, and sheltered by a grove of trees upon the
south and west, was similar to that at J. The instrument itself was like

that at J.

     The diurnal movements had a range of from 4 to 40 mm. The westerly
excursion usually commenced at 5 or 6 A.M., and continued until about 4
or 6 P.M. (fig. 8). The motion was therefore about one hour in advance of

that at J, which roughly corresponds to the difference in time at which
the ground in their respective vicinities were exposed to the morning sun.

Comparing the hours at which the easterly and westerly motions of J and

K were completed in fifteen cases, they closely agree. When these
Khours do not agree, has usually reached its western limit from one to

four hours before J. In two instances it completed this movement seven
hours after J, while in two other cases one pendulum has been near its
western limit, while the other has practically completed its movement in
an opposite direction.

     Tremors were not marked. The object in placing J and K, which
were 275 yards distant from each other, on opposite sides of a small grove
of trees, was with the expectation of finding that at the same time they
moved in opposite direction. It is seen that the expectation was not

realised.

concrete floor of a cellar in the north-western corner of the Engineering

College at the Imperial University. It is without recording apparatus.

Its pointer floats over a scale, and its position is noted every day about

noon. When first set up on September 19, 1894, it had a period of

28 seconds. Its movements, which are indicated in millimetres, the sign

--+ meaning displacement towards the west and towards the north and

east, have been gradual. They were as follows :

   --Pendulum at M. The object of this pendulum, which was installed

upon the same column as A, was somewhat different from that of the others
described in this series. It consisted of an aluminium boom loaded at its
outer end with a weight of about 300 grms. In addition to this it
carried a small vessel of ink from which a capillary tube projected, making
the total length of the boom about 4 feet 6 inches. This tube was
balanced, so that it barely touched the surface of a band of paper moving
at the rate of about 8 inches per hour. The force required to deflect the
boom one millimetre when applied at a distance of 4 feet fi'om the agate
pivot was approximately one milligramme. Before it was destroyed by fire

it recorded the occurrence of several local earthquakes, and, considering its

sensibility to tilting, it is probable that it would have recorded the gravi-

Atational elastic waves of disturbances originating at great distances.

necessary adjunct to such an apparatus in order to obtain an open diagram
is the addition of a quick speed feed for the paper, which must come into
action directly the pendulum commences to be deflected to the right and

left of its normal position. Such a device was designed for me by my

colleague, Mr. C. D. West, and it apparently works more satisfactorily

than the original form of this kind of apparatus which is found in the

Gray-Milne seismograph.

   --Pendulum at N. Sensibility, January 5, 1895, 1°=.3 mm. January 25,

=1895, l°=2-5 mm., or 1 mm. r'-03. The pendulum used at this

station was origiiaally at K. The hut was situated on the western side of
TJyeno Park, near to its southern extremity. It was sheltered by trees

on its eastern and southern sides. On its western side, where it was open,
there was a steep scarp leading down to the Shinobadzu Pond, which lies

Kin the bottom of a flat open valley. A, J, and were on the plateau on

 the opposite side of this valley, the heights of these stations being about
 50 feet above the flat plain on which the greater portion of Tokio is

situated. The movements were usually small, seldom exceeding 7 mm.
      The westerly movement commenced from about 6 or 9 p.m., and con-

 tinued until about noon next day ; that is to say, that about the time ivhen

 the instruments u2)on the opposite hill or 2)lateau were goi^ig eastwards, the

 instrument at Uyeno went towards the ivest, and vice versa (fig. 10, p. 136).

     Pendulum at 0.-- Sensibility, January 12, 1895, l°=l-5 mm.
January 22, 1805, l°=:l-5 mm. Station O was situated at a place about

 20 yards to the south of J. It only differed from the instrument at this

 latter station in the fact that the boom of the pendulum pointed from

 west towards the east, and it therefore recorded north and south motion.
120 REPORT-- 1895.

During the few weeks it was used, it showed a small but regular diurnal
fluctuation, being farthest north about 3 or 5 P.M., and farthest south

--between 9 a.m. and noon (fig. 12, p. 137).
     Pendulum at P. Sensibility about the same as N. The instrumeat

Nused at this station was the same as that used at and K.

      The hut faced an open space about 70 yards square on its northern
side, but on all other sides it was shaded by high trees. For one or two

hours about mid-day a few rays of sunshine reached the roof of the hut
and the northern side of the open space. That the ground within 20 or

30 yards of the hut had but little sunshine may be inferred from the fact

that after a fall of snow this remained upon the ground for ten or fifteen

days. On open ground the snow disappeared in two or three days.

During the day this would slightly thaw upon its surface, and at night it
would freeze. About 50 yards to the east, a bluff' sloped down to the

Tokio plain.

     Observations were only made between January 14 and February 4.
The movements were extremely irregular, the most peculiar happening

between January 14 and January 26. On these days, excepting the 23rd

and 25th, during the night the pendulum made a rapid excursion towards
the east, returning to its normal position some time about noon on the
following day. These abnormal movements took place upon nights when

it was unusually cold, and therefore they may have been due to the freez-

ing of moisture beneath or in the vicinity of the column (fig. 2).

   --Pendulum at Q. This instrument, which is in charge of the Meteoro-

logical Department, is as well installed as the pendulum at A. It stands-
on a stone column in a dark room in the same building with a self-
recording electrometer. The boom, which at first was partly made of
lacquered bamboo, but which has been replaced by one of aluminium,,
points from north to south. Immediately outside the room there is one-
of the castle walls sloping down to a deep moat, beyond which comes the

plain of Tokio.

     The diurnal movements are slight, but decided, the westerly excur-
sion being completed at from 3 to 6 p.m., and the easterly at about 6 a.m.,

--wliich corresponds to the motions at J and K. Tremors are slight.
     Pendidnm at R. This pendulum was set up in a hut in the garden at
No. 17, Kaga Yashiki, Tokio. At a distance of about 5 yards on its
western side a steep bank leads down to a road, which joins a second road

at right angles on the north side of the hut, about 30 feet below the level
of the garden.

     The instrument is intended to act as a seismograph, sensitive to slight
vibratory motions, while from the length of its boom, which is about
3 feet, it is also able to record slight changes in level. The first 2 inches
of the boom is a small metal tube, at one end of which there is an agate
cup. This boom is continued by a reed, at the end of which there is a
         ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC THENOMENA OF JAPAN. 121

  black filament of straw. To balance the weight of the reed and straw a
   light arm, resting upon a pivot on the underside of the brass tube, carries,
  at its extremities two small weights. Assuming the pivoted mass, which
  has a considerable moment of ineitia and but little weight, to be the centre
  of oscillation of the system, which is held in a horizontal position by u
  thin wire tie, then the arrangement is that of a conical pendulum seismo-
   graph, having a multiplication of about tweiaty, and without the friction
  of a writing pointer. The black hair at the extremity of the boom floats
  above the slit in the box containing the drum, carrying the photographic
  film, which moves at a rate of 2 inches per houi-. The resulting diagram,
  is a white line showing the position of the shadow of the hair-like-

   filament.

     A modification of this instrument was to reduce the length of th&

  boom to 2 feet, and because the trace given by the shadow of the filament
  at the end of the boom was wanting in sharpness, the filament was re-
  placed by a thin plate of mica about half an inch square, with a small slit

  in its centre, similar to that used in the larger apparatus. Because the

  floating plate attached to the boom does not cover the whole of the slit in
  the box above the drum carrying the photographic film, the diagram is a
  black line given by the spot of light from the crossed slits, bounded on the-
  right and left by a black band, the irregularities on the inside edges of
  which correspond with the irregularities on the central line. Every houi'
  a separate clock depresses on one end of a balanced lever, at the other end
  of which there is a light vane which rises in front of the lamp, and cuts
  tlie light oS for one minute. The result is that the central line (whem.
  there are no tremors), and the two bands at all times, are transversely
  marked by a distinct white line. Not only do the bands indicate time,
  and repeat the sinuosities and other movements shown on the central line,
  but by the presence or absence of striations they immediately show whether
  the clock driving the drum has been working regularly.

       Instead of cutting otf the light from the lamp, the light is now cut oft"
  the edge of the fixed slit by the hour hand of a watch moving horizontally

  across the same (fig. 3).

                                                                     Fig. 3.

 per hour, whicli, from the results obtained, appears to be a suitable speed
 for recording diurnal waves and earth tremors (fig. 9). The western elonga-
 tion is completed rather suddenly between 7 and 8 a.m. (nineteen and twenty
 liours). The eastern movement, which is performed with extreme irregu-

 larity, is ended about 4 p.m. The amplitude of this wave is about 30 mm.
122 REPORT-- 1895.

During the day, or from 7 A.M. until about 9 p.m., tremors are absent, but
they occur in a very marked manner between 9 p.i\r. and 7 a.m., when they
suddenly cease (tig. 9).

     The central part of fig. 3 shows a white band the width of a small plate
of blackened mica at the end of a reed boom. In the mica there is a
broad and a narrow slit, which correspond to the broad and thin lines in
the diagram. The object of the broad line is to obtain a photogram,
when the boom and its plate of mica are displaced rapidly, at which times

sufficient light may not pass through the narrow slit to alFect the bromide

paper. When the motion is slow the tine slit gives the best definition. The

vertical white marks at distances of 41 mm. apai't are made by the pro-

longation of the minute hand of a watch crossing one end of the fixed
slit every hour. If the instrument be disturbed at knoton times, and the
times at which these disturbances took place be determined by the
irregularities produced on the broad and thin bands, the errors in these
readings vary between three and twenty seconds. Should the paper
move irregularly, this is shown by ditferences in the length of the spaces
representing hours, while the times at which retardation or acceleration
took place are shown by vertical striations in the broad black bands.

This is the form of recording surface which I am using to obtain photo-

grams of movements due to earthquakes. It is not suitable for tremors

or daily waves.

   --Pendulum at S. This pendulum, originally at N, commenced its

records on April 24, 1895, at the Agricultural School at Komaba, which
is five and a half miles distant in a S.W. direction from the University.
Komaba is .situated on a flat plateau, and the nearest irregularity in the
contour of the ground from the instrument which stands in the middle of
a field partly covered with corn is at a distance of about half a mile, where
there is a small valley. The soil is so light and dusty that a walking-
stick may be pushed into it for a depth of two or three feet. Beneath
this comes a red earth. The records show tremors, but they are small.

    A westerly motion of about 5 mm. is completed at about eighteen

hours, or 6 A.M., and an easterly movement of equal amount at about three

hours, or 3 p.m. (fig. 11, p. 137).

     On the S.E. side of the instrument the ground is bare, and during the

day the pendulum moves to this side.

        (6) Daily Wave Records.

In the following tables the localities or instruments are indicated by

capital letters. The times at which an instrument completed its N.E.,

S.W., E., or W. excursion are indicated by hours, or 24, corresponding

to mid-day, and 12 to midnight. The figui'es in brackets give in milli-

metres the amplitude of the displacements. When a dash takes the place

of hours it means that the displacements were too small to be measured,

or that the diagram was a straight line. When the space for hours is

left blank, it signifies that for some reason or other, either that no diagram

Awas taken or that it has been lost.  record like 9-15 on October 15

Ameans that the S.W. motion of was completed between nine and fifteen

hours.

     In order to determine the existence or non-existence of periodical
movements greater than twenty-four hours, the mid-day position of

Ainstruments and J were plotted on squared paper. This was done

for dates between October 13 and December 4, 1894. Because the

Kinstrument at during the period wandered so rapidly towards the east,

                                                                   Fig. 4.

and had in consequence to be repeatedly re-adjusted, its records have not
been considered. Whether the mid-day reading is the best one to
represent the mean daily position of the instruments must for the present
be left until a second examination of the diagrams has been made, when

the analysis may be continued up to the end of the first week in

February 1895 (fig. 4).

taken place may be due to the direction in which the instruments or their
foundations have wai'ped, or, what is equally probable, they may each

have moved away from an exposed area which, in consequence of evapora-

tion, may have been rising. About this general movement of the pendulums

which might be included in the previous section of this report, because it

only refers to observations extending over fifty-two days with pendulum*,

one of which had a light foundation, no definite conclusions can be stated.

One thing, however, which is clear, and which can hardly be

attributed to" the warping of instruments or their foundations, is that

the pendulums Avandered at the same time in the same directions. For

Athe first four days the pendulums at and J moved westwards, for the

next twelve days they moved eastwards, after which there was a slight

westerly and then an easterly motion up to the fortieth day, when they

both turned quickly westwards. This synchronism in direction of motion

is evidently due to some general cause, which may act on the surface of
Athe earth or within its interior.
                                    barometric curve determined in

Aa manner similar to that in which the curves for and J were deter-

mined shows that atmospheric pressure was near its maximum when the

pendulums were at their western limits, but the relationship between this

curve and those of the pendulums is not sufficiently clear to conclude

that the movements of the pendulums have been altogether due to

fluctuation in atmospheric pressure. Possibly the movements may have

been due to evaporation and precipitation lightening or loading some

particular area in the vicinity of the pendulums.

The earthijuakes of local origin indicated by circles on the curve for

A, which occurred during the time that there was a rapid westerly

motion, suggest the idea that the movements may have a hypogenic

     The table below gives in millimetres the difference in the mid-day read-

ings of the positions of the pendulums A and J. The sign -f- indicates-
that during the past twenty-four hours the pendulum has moved so many

towards the east. The sign ? means that no reading had been taken or

that no displacement was observed.

its existence in such places, and had instruments of greater sensibility been
employed it is likely that it might have been detected. It was perceptible
and often measurable, but by no means pronounced in the records from

my house (A), where the instrument was well founded and in an east and

a west direction, well protected from temperature effects upon the sur-
rounding soil. It must not be forgotten that this instrument was the

most sensitive, being capable of recording changes of 0"-l. Had the

sen.sibility of this instrument not exceeded that of other instruments less

favourably installed, it is doubtful whether it would have shown any
marked trace of the daily wave.

    Two instruments in an underground chamber (E and F), where as in the

Pcaves the daily change in temperature did not exceed C., often showed

the daily wave in a marked manner, but it was not so great as it was at
stations J and Iv upon the surface. The conclusion to which these

observations lead is that the daily wave is not due to fluctuations in tem-

perature immediately near to the instruments, but that it is a surface
phenomenon which penetrates to a depth of at least 12 feet in the

alluvium.

    An instrument upon the surface (J) the ground round which was

exposed to the sun upon all sides excepting the east, and another (K)
which was exposed on all sides excepting the west, showed large diurnal
waves, and notwithstanding the fact that between these two stations there
was a pond and a grove of tall trees, the pendulums usually moved in the

.same direction at about the same time. The magnitude of the movements
was different, but with this exception the only other difference was that
J, the open ground round which was exposed to the afternoon .sun for one
or two hours longer than the open ground round K, continued its westerly

Kmotion for one or two houi-s longer than (figs. 7 and 8).

    An experiment made at J was to dig a trench 5 feet in depth round

the south and west sides of the hut. This did not appear in any
way to affect the amplitude of the daily wave, but it seemed to increase
the suddenness with which the westerly displacement commenced, and at
the same time the number of hours occupied in making a complete wave

was reduced. With an instrument at O, a few yards from J, which
recorded north and south motions, the wave was regular but of small
amplitude, the northern movement coinciding with the western motion of
J and K. The direction of maximum tilting may therefore have approxi-
mately l)een W.N.W. and E.S.E. On the western side of a plateau

facing the eastern slope of the plateau on which A, J, K, and O were

Nsituated, an instrument showed a daily wave, but the xoesterly exciorsion

of ihe pendulum loas completed only a feio hours later than the easterly
excursion was completed by those iipon the opposite hill. It appeared as
if the two bluffs, or at least the trees upon them, inclined towards each
other, and then away from each other once in twenty-four hours.
Between the two bluffs there is an open valley, in which there'is a lake or
pond nearly half a mile in breadth.

   NThat the records at were small may be attributed partly to the fact

that the instrument never had given to it any great degree of sensitive-
ness, and partly to the fact that on all sides excepting the west the ground
immediately round the instrument was well shaded by tall trees. There
is, however, a large open space about 100 yards to the east of this station.

NAt another station P, on the eastern side of the plateau, on which was

situated, and at a distance fz-om it of about 200 yards, the movements,
ox THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 133

especiiilly upon frosty niglits, were extremely erratic, and they may

probably have been produced by the freezing of the ground. When the

cold was not great the movements were small, and here, again, the ground

around the instrument was so well shaded by trees that after a snow-

storm it would take from ten to fifteen days to melt away the snow, which

at other places disappeared in one or two days. At Q, R, S, and O

the movement during the day was towards the side on which the ground

near to the instruments was most exposed to the sun.

One very important observation especially marked at stations where

large diurnal waves were recorded was that on rainy or doiidy daya these

instruments ivere steady, and no dbirnal wave ivas recorded.

The general conclusion to which these observations on the diurnal wave

point is that on the alluvium on open ground, the daily wave is most

pronounced on the surface, it is less in amplitude, but it may be decided at

a depth of 12 feet ; while on a massive foundation the ground round which

is well protected by a building or trees the wave is slight. Deep under-

ground on a rock foundation with instruments such as I have had at my

disposal it is not perceptible, but it is not improbable that a residual effect

of the surface motion might be detected with more delicate apparatus.

The cause of the motion is not any immediate effect of temperature upon

the instruments, nor if we except the case where actual freezing of moisture

in the ground round and possibly inside one of the huts took place does it

appear to be due to expansion or contraction in or near the foundations

accompanying the acquisition or withdrawal of heat.

The most active cause producing the movement which takes place

during the day may be the fact that the ground on different sides of an

instrument is unequally exposed to effects producing evaporation. The

retrograde motion during the night, which is smaller and more gentle than

that which has happened during the day, may be due to tlie unequal

condensation of moisture on two sides of a station.

  --1. Effects accompanying Evaporation (Daylight Effect). As the side

of a station from which most moisture is withdrawn to be dissipated in

the atmosphere has been relieved of a load, we should expect it to rise,

and this effect ought, vcv alluvium, to be perceptible to some depth. The

same area, because it is contracting like a drying sponge, may sink, but

tliis would be a superficial action.

On open ground, under favourable circumstances, the load taken away

from a surface of earth by evaporation may amount to 4 or 5 lb. per

square yard, or from an area 20 yards square, about 1 ton. Experiment

has shown that 2 tons of wat^r taken out of a well and run off down a

hill will cause a pendulum at a distance of 20 or 30 yards to behave as if

the ground upon the well side had risen. If these premises are correct,

then an instrument well surrounded by trees or buildings, because the

evaporation is slight and is not likely to be much more marked upon one

Aside than it is upon another, should show but little motion.  pendulum

at a station freely and uniformly exposed upon all sides siiould also

show but little change. During the morning a north-south pendulum

would be expected to move slightly towards the west. For some hours

after the sun's meridian passage there would be a pause in such displace-

ment, after which a retrograde motion would set in. An instrument

with open ground upon its eastern side would, during the morning, be

expected to move westwards ; while at the same time another instrument,

iieitlier sliould there be an appreciable trace of diurnal waves ou days

when it was wet or cloudy.

    2. Contraction due to Desiccntion. --If the desiccation due to heating

l^y the sun is followed by contraction, we should expect that during the
<lay a pendulum would move towards the side losing the greatest amount

of  moisture ; that is to  say,  its movement would  be in a  direction opposite
to  that accompanying                                due to
                            the  removal of a load            evaporation. On

ground covered by trees or buildings, or on ground uniformly open all

round, but littrle motion should be expected. Whatever effect was observed

it is not likely that it would penetrate many inches beneath the surface.

    The following is a comparison of these considerations, with the

observed movements of the various pendulums and the character of the

surrounding ground.
    AFor 100 yards to the east and west of
                                            the ground is equally open.

The most open ground, however, lies to the east. It would therefore be

expected that movement during the day due to unloading would be west-

wards. The observed movements, however, although generally westwards,

showed too many irregularities, and were too feeble to justify a conclusion

that they were due to such an influence (tig. 6).
     For 100 yards round station J the ground is more open upon the

western side than upon the eastern side, and the westerly motion might

therefore be attributed to desiccation and contraction upon this side.

Beyond this limit, however, the ground is most open upon the eastern
side, which might therefore, by evaporation, rise. This would give a

westerly motion (tig. 7).

   KFor 100 yards round the ground is most open upon the eastern side,

and desiccation would result in an eastern displacement. The westerly

motion recorded seems to find its only explanation in the fact that the
eastern side of the instrument is more open than the western side, but

the reason that these movements were greater than those at J is not

clear (fig. 8).

   RImmediately to the west of there are tall trees and a deep cutting.

which is drying. Beyond this limit, however, there is far more open
ground on the N.W., W., and S.W. sides of the station than there is in

opposite directions, and the pronounced easterly motion may therefore

be due to the unloading on the western side (fig. 9).

on the same level there is at a distance of about one hundred yards a
smaller area of open ground facing the Exhibition buildings. The move-
ment is therefore as if the ground on the side of the largest evaporation
area had arisen. But the movement is small (fig. 10).
ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 137

     Near to the instrument at S on the west side the ground is covered with
green corn about one foot in height, while towards the S.E. there is a
strip of bare ground perhaps fifty yards wide and one Imndred yards in
length. The movement, which, however, is slight, is towards the area

most open to the sun.

     Neglecting this strip, then, there is very much more open ground on
the western than upon the eastern side of the station, and the movement
may be explained on the assumption that this side, because it loses the

most weight, rises relatively to the other (fig. 11).

    Near to O the ground is somewhat more open on the north side, and

it would appear that the motion was towards this side. Because the
movements are slight, they might equally well be explained as a com-
ponent of a south-eastern tilting due to greater relief of load upon the
S.E. side, whicli is more exposed than that in the opposite direction.

cation in the immediate vicinity of an instrument, this detailed examina-
tion of the observations in relation to the localities at which they were

the continuity of the ground upon that side, which it is assumed in order
to produce the easterly deflection must rise.

       I put forward these conclusions simply as being, for the present at least,

the best that I am able to arrive at as explanatory of my own observa-

tions. The conclusions reached by Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz only

partly confirm my results. In the British Association Report for 189;j,

on p. 316, he says that ' the range of motion is on an average very nearly
p-oportional to either the quantity of sunshine or the maximum oscillation
of temperature during the day.' This and the fact that the movements
at TenerifFe, where the observatory appears to have been founded on and
surrounded by soil and rock, were very much more pronounced than they
were at Potsdam and Wilhelmshaven, where the soil was comparatively
soft, apparently support the view that the diurnal wave may be a distor-

tional efl'ect due to evaporation. On p. 320 of the same report, however,

 he says that ' at Potsdam as well as Orotava the average range of daily
 motion agrees most remarkably with those meteorological elements which

we may consider as a measure of the intensity of solar radiation. But I
must not omit to remark that the single days do not show this coincidence

equally well. For cloudy days occur with a large range of oscillation, and
clear days with a small range.'

    Although my observations in Japan have shown that when it was

cloudy and wet the diurnal wave has been absent, it is not impossible that

there may be cloudy days when, in consequence of wind, evaporation may
occur, and in consequence the daylight distortion may be marked.

   --3. Effects due to Condensatiun{Xiy]it Effect). It has been shown that

.at a favourably situated station the evaporation effect which has been

marked during the morning may late in the afternoon be the means of

starting a retrograde movement. It, however, remains to be explained

why a motion possibly commenced in this manner continues slowly during

the night until about 6 a.m. upon the following morning. Because this

movement is comparatively small it may be produced by the addition or

removal of a comparatively small load.
     The pi'ecipitation of dew, which on a uniform area like evaporation

follows in the wake of the sun, represents a feeble load, but the retrograde
motion continues when dew is not visible. But although dew may not be
visible, if we look beneatli a board which has been lying on the ground

.all night it is usually found to be very wet. This observation suggested

the idea that just as moisture is condensed beneath a board, so it may

be condensed in the ground within one or two inches of the actual

surface.

      During a hot day moisture is evaporated from the soil, which is per-
ceptibly heated to a depth of about one foot. Shortly after sunset the
surface to a depth of one or two inches is chilled or in winter it is frozen.
The result of this is, that moisture rising as vapour and by capillarity
from water-bearing strata is condensed on the underside of the chilled sur-
face. Like the dew we see on a uniformly covered surface the underground
dew should be first precipitated on the eastern side of a station and sub-

sequently ujDon the western side, and therefore during the night the surface

on the former side gains weight at an earlier hour than the latter.
     To determine how far superficial soils gain in weight by an action of

this description, independently of moisture precipitated from the atmo-
sphere or condensed as it rises out of the ground, the following experi-

ments were made. Two boxes each 1 ft. 6 in. square and 2 in. deeji were
      ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 139

balanced on the extremities of beams carried upon knife edges. One box
had a bottom made of tin and the other of fine wire netting, and each was
filled with earth. Excepting when they were weighed, by placing weights

at the other ends of the beams, they Avere allowed to rest on the soft

earth of my garden. Sometimes it was found that during a night both

boxes would lose weight, but at other times it was found that the weight
of the box with the tin bottom had not changed, whilst the one with the
wire netting had gained from 2 to 2-5 ounces, which apparently showed
that there had been a condensation of moisture coming up frona beneath
of 10 ounces per square yard, or about one-eighth of that which might

have been removed during a day by evaporation. As my notes upon

these experiments were destroyed by fire, what is here said can only be
taken as indicating the character of a phenomenon which hitherto has not

received attention.

     Whether the causes which have been described are sufficient to account
for the diurnal movements of a horizontal pendulum remains for future

investigators to decide.

     The gradual taking away of weight, followed by a gradual addition of
weight unequally on the two sides of a pendulum during each period of
24 hours, will account for the observed movements, and iii the evapora-
tion of moisture during the day and the precipitation of moisture on

the surface, together with its condensation beneath the surface during the

night, we have phenomena which relieve or load surfaces in the required

manner.

                                                   (h) Tremors.

     In the third Report to the British Association, 1883, after observing
tremors with the ordinary Italian form of tromometer, I attributed their
origin either to the effects of high winds or to small but rapidly recurring

variations in atmospheric pressure, such as may be observed during a

typhoon.
     After analysing a long series of records of these movements, which

were obtained from an automatic tremor recorder, and comparing the
results with observations made in Italy, the conclusion arrived at was that

tremors were at a maximum when the barometrical gradient was steep,

no matter whether at the place where the tremors were observed the
barometer was high or whether it was low.

     This relationship between tremors and the state of the barometric
gradient, although it did not explain the origin of tremors, tended to
destroy the distinction between tremors which occur with a low barometer,
and are called haro-seismic motions, and those which appear during periods
of high pressure, which are called volcano -seismic disturbances.

    An examination of the photograms obtained from the horizontal

pendulums, which permit of more accurate analysis than those previously
obtained, although it does not show that tremors only occur at the times
when the bai-ometric gradient is steep, shows that at such times tremor
storms are marked. These same diagrams, however, on account of the
relationship they show between tremors, the changes in the position of a
horizontal pendulum, barometrical pressure, and the diurnal wave, lead

me to withdraw the suggestion that, because steep gradients are usually
accompanied by wind, such winds, whether they are local or distant, may

be the immediate cause of tremors. In their times of occurrence winds
                      --

--140 REPORT 1895.

and tremors undoubtedly show a close relationship, and therefore the former
may, by its mechanical action upon buildings, trees, and the surface of a
country, produce slight tremors, and influence the character of a record.

     The points which are marked in connection with the recent

obsei'vations are as follows :

                 1. Belationship of Tremors to Localities and Instruments,

     Tremors have been pronounced at Station A, the instrument at which

station, however, was the one most sensible to changes of level. At

stations on the surface in Tokio they have been feeble, but have varied
in their intensity. Underground upon the rock they have iiever been
observed. This latter observation, which is based upon records obtained

from five instruments, is in direct opposition to the observations made at
Rocca di Papa in Italy, whei-e, I understand, tremors are as pronounced
underground as they are upon the surface.

    At Station A, an instrument which showed ti'emors even in a more

marked manner than the large horizontal pendulum, was a similar instru-
ment made of a few millimetres of aluminium wire, a small mirror, and a
needle point, weighing only a few grammes, a comparatively large form of

which is described in the Report for 1892. On account of the manner in

which the spots of light reflected from the mirrors of a pair of these
instruments placed side by side would come to rest, and then start
suddenly to move in the same direction, I was led to the conclusion that
they were actuated by an intermittent tilting, and therefore that tremors,
rather than being elastic vibrations, had the character of wave-like
undulations.^ The fact that the instrument most sensitive to changes of
level gave the most pronounced records appeared to strengthen this sup-
position, and I was led to call these movements eaith pulsations.

     The only effect produced ))y heavy gusts of wind striking the building,
or the beating of a steam hammer at a distance of fifty yards, is to pro-
duce a temporary vibration in the pointers of an instrument ; but there is
no angular displacement, and consequent swing, which characterises the
movements during a tremor storm.

   AAn important observation made at Station was that tremors were

produced when two tons of water were taken out of a well distant about
thirty yards. The operation caused the ground upon the well side to rise,
and the horizontal pendulum was gradually displaced in an opposite
direction. From this it may be inferred that either the pendulum took
up its new position intermittently, or that the level of the ground changed
intermittently. Whichevei- it may have been, it may be concluded that

whenever a rapid change in the inclination of the ground takes place,

horizontal and probably other pendulums may be caused to swing, and, as

will be seen in the next section, at least a portion of the tremor records

may be explained on the supposition that they are due to such causes.

                          2. Relationship of Tremors to the Diurnal Wave.

     (1) Even when a horizontal pendulum is steadily following the diurnal
wave and no tremors are visible, slight tremors nearly always appear
about 6 or 9 a.m., just at the time when its easterly excursion has been
completed and it turns to commence a relatively rapid motion towards the
west (figs. 9 and 1.3).

                 ' The instruments were under the same cover. See Appendix.
     ox THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OK JAPAN. ] il
     (2) Should there be a tremor storm extending over one or two days
tliere is a maximum motion at aljout 6 or 9 A.M. (figs. 9 and 13).

     (3) Large daily waves nearly always correspond -with pronounced
tremors (47 cases).

    (4) When no daily wave appears, or when it is feeble, which usually

happens when the weather is dull or wet, there have been eight cases of
feeble tremors, and nine cases where tremors have loeen practically

absent.

   --(5) The greatest motion is experienced, or motion is most frequent, while

the pendulum is moving eastwai-ds an observation which is connected
with the remarks in the next section.

              3. Relationship of Tremors to the Hours of Day and Night.
     (1) It has been shown that tremors are most frequent or at their
maximum at about 6 or 9 a.m. (figs. 9 and 13).
     (2) The hours during which storms are the most frequent are from
9 P.M. or midnight until mid day. During the afternoon and evening,

therefore, tremors are not so frequent.

    (3) The tremors at 6 or 9 a.m. may be attributed to irregular move-

ments accompanying the reversal in the inclination of the ground which

                                                                   Fig. 13.

takes place at these hours, but if the tremors which occur at night are to
be attributed to an intermittent change in level, it then becomes neces-

sary to explain why the smallest changes in level are most intermittent in

their character, which supposition is improbable. The accompanyino-

figure shows how a tremor storm which may continue over several days
has a maximum at 6 or 9 a.m., and also, as it dies out, that it terminates

with slight tremoi's at these particular hours. It is taken from instru-
mejit A.

                     4. jRc'IationsMp of Tremors to Barometrical Conditions.

     (1) Tremors are apparently as mai'ked with a high barometer as with
a low barometer.

     (2) Tremors chiefly occur with steep barometric gradients.

     (3) They are marked when barometric changes are rapid, whether the

barometer is rising or whether it is falling.
     (4) Although it is not likely that the daily fluctuation of the barometer

should have any marked effect upon the production of tremors, it may be
noted that the maximum of tremors occurs when the barometer is at its
greatest height and about to fall rapidly to its daily mimimum. Mr. T.
Wada, of the Meteorological Observatory, has kindly given me the follow-
ing table showing the daily barometrical maxima and minima deduced from

eight years' observations :

            --
                                    --

frequent from the end of June until the end of November, and accompany
winds having a velocity of from 50 to 100 km. per hour, the barometer
being low. During the remaining months of the year although slight

tremors are frequent it is seldom that they are pronounced. When winds

are fairly strong, reaching 30 or 40 km., unless these are continuous over

several days the tremors are slight. Cases occur when tremors are fairly
frequent with a low barometer (757 mm.) whilst there was but little wind.
On the other hand, with a wind not exceeding 30 km., there have been
decided tremors with a high barometer (763 mm.). The conclusion to be
derived from these records, which, however, do not show the state of the

bai-ometric gradient, is that tremors are frequent with high winds, with
winds of moderate intensity if these are continuous over several days, and

at times when the barometer is low. Because they are sometimes absent
when a wind of moderate intensity is blowing, it would seem that their
appearance may be more closely connected with changes in barometrical
pressure than with the mechanical effects of wind upon surface irregulari-
ties. They do not appear to be connected with daily changes in tempera-

ture, the hygrometric state of the atmosphere, or with the occuri'ence of
earthquakes.

     Since writing the above Father M. Saderra, S.J., Director of the Obser-
vatory at Manila, writes me as follows : 'Evidently the results are influenced
by atmospheric currents, but in an indirect manner, as is proved by the-
fact that the hours of greatest wind force and* greatest movements of the
tromometer do not always coincide. The influence is verified by means
of the vibratory motion which the wind produces in the earth itself by
impinging against mountains. It now remains to observe and study this
influence and endeavour to ascertain which wind exerts most influence.
Hitherto this has not been feasible, but now, God helping, I will set

about doing it.'

     Although these observations throw a certain amount of new light upon
the occurrence of tremors, and possibly explain their morning frequency,

the causes producing tremor storms are yet obscure In Japan, at least,
they appear to be a surface phenomenon which exhibits itself in different
degrees in different localities. Although the longer period motions of hori-

zontal pendulums show that changes in barometrical pressure may be suf-

ficient to produce changes in level, it does not seem unlikely that rapid
alterations in barometrical pressure over an area, the yielding of diflTerent

portions of which are unequal, may be sufficient to create irregular

mechanical distui'bances in such a district, and the motion once started as

with t* severe earthquake may continue for several hours after the initiat-
ing vo.use has ceased. Whatever may be the cause of these ubiquitous
phenomena, because they interfere with so many delicate physical opera-
tions, they certainly demand serious attention. For the assistance of
those who desire to scrutinise the analyses of which I have only given
the results or to make new investigations, the following list of meteoro-

logical conditions during the period which has been considered is here
appended. (See Appendix, p. 182.)

     One of the most interesting of these disturbances is that which was
recorded at three stations, at about 18 hours, on October 27. The origin
of this was near to the Antipodes of Japan, in the Argentine E.epublic.
In the shaken district Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz tells nie that the mean
velocity of progagation was about 1-2 km. per sec. Mr. C. Davison tells

nie that it reached Europe to be recorded at Rome with a mean velocity

for the large motion, of 3-17 km. per sec, the preliminary vibrations
having a velocity of 10-38 km. per. sec. These latter movements reached
Charkow and Nicolaiew with velocities of 11-47 and 9'17 km. per .sec.
If the record J for Japan can be assumed to be approximately correct,
then the movements recorded in Japan, if they were propagated over the

.surface of the earth, reached that country with a mean velocity of 19 km,
per sec' The figure is reduced from the record of K.

assistant of the Meteorological Bureau, who has worked with me, pointing

out doubtful information, translating paj^ers, calculating areas, determining
centres, tilling in maps, and in carrying out other tedious operations for
the last twelve months.

     The chief reason for terminating the catalogues at the end of 1892 is
because the material subsequent to that date has not yet been reduced to

the map form, and to examine all the documents necessary to accomplish
tliis would have occupied at least another year ; also it may be added that

what has been done is in all probability sufficient to determine whether
work of this description is likely to lead to results of sufficient importance

to guarantee its continuance.

                                (6) Explanation of tlie Catalogues.

     In the first catalogue the shocks are placed in chronological order from

1 to 8,331. When disturbances have apparently been simultaneous in

two distant localities, they are included under a single number.
      In the second and third columns the date and time for each disturbance

are given. When the latter is noted to seconds, the record refers to the

commencement of motion at an observatory, like that in Tokio, which is
provided with automatic chronogiaphs. Until the end of 1887, these
recoi'ds, Mhich are practically correct, refer to Tokio mean time, or
9 hr. 19 min. 1 sec. before Greenwich mean time. Subsequently to this date
the times given are those of Long. 135° E.,or nine hours before Greenwich
mean time. The other time records are only approximately correct, and.
cannot be used in any investigation relating to the velocity Avith which

earthquake motion is propagated.
      The fourth column gives in square ri (1 square ri=5-96 square miles)

the land area which was shaken. For small shocks which were only felt
at one or two stations the determination of this quantity has largely
 depended upon the judgment of the observer. The figures given are those
 obtained from the maps by means of a planimeter and entered in the
 records of the Meteorological Department. In the second catalogue, based

 upon a second inspection of the maps, it will be noticed that many mate-
 rial alterations have been made in these quantities. In many instances

 the land areas of the first catalogue are total areas, but in others they only
 represent an insignificant portion of a disturbed tract, the centre of which
 was beneath the bed of the ocean. The limits of the areas given are those

 places round an origin up to which the movement was perceptible to
 people or sufficiently strong to have been recorded by ordinai-y seismo-
 graphs. With instruments like delicately adjusted horizontal pendulums,
 there is no doubt that movements might have been detected far beyond these
 arbitrary limits. For example, shock number 4,145 has assigned to it a
 land area of 15,750 sq. ri, when we have good reasons for believing that
 with suitable instruments it might have been noted at any point upon the

  surface of our globe.

       The number in the fifth column approximately indicates, as shown
  upon the key map, the epicentre of a disturbance, or a number on the
  coast line nearest to a submarine origin. In the second catalogue, the
  position of a submarine origin, by means of a distance in tens of miles
  and the direction in which it is to be measui-ed from a central number, is

  defined more closely. On the key map the numbers referring to squares,
     '

152     --REPORT 1895.

each 10 miles by 10 iniles, commence at the top and I'un from left to right
down to the bottom of the same.

    A line drawn on the key map thi'ough the numbers in the sixth column

gives the boundary of tlie land surface which was shaken. The area

  t>

of this should be equal to the quantity in the second column. By com-
pleting, when it may be necessary, this outline seawards, a toUd area is

obtained, which is indicated by its major and minor axes in the second

 catalogue.

     In tlie small map, which is a photographic reproduction of a map the

same size as the key map, the small dots indicate the position of all the
epicentral numbers, and the large numerals ranging from 1 to 15, districts
in which earthquakes are frequent. Distiicts 6 and 7 are bounded by
straight lines because there was not sufficient space in which to place all

the dots. For examjjle, in District 7 all the dots indicate earthquakes
which originated about the centre of this district. Until October 28,
1891, the disturbances in this district were not more numerous than they

are in District 8.

    When an earthquake has been felt at the extremities of the Empire,

and at the same time not along a great length of coast line, as in Districts
1 and 10, it is often difficult to determine the direction or distance from
the coast line of its origin. In these cases the assumption made lias been
that the shocks just reaching the coast have originated from about the
same locality as the larger shocks which have spread some distance along

the .shore line, these stronger disturbances being severe at places just

+ --reached by their feebler successors. The signs and along the coast

line indicate that near these places there are evidences of secular elevation

or depression. This information was obtained by the help of Professor
D. Kikuclii, who kindly assisted in the distribution of a circular to vfadous
towns and villages round the coast of the Empire inquiring whether from

maps, traditions, or observations there wei'e reasons to believe that
changes had taken place in the relative position of the land and water.

The large black dots on the map indicate the positions of more or less

active volanic cones, in the neighbourhood of which there are huge bosses

of volcanic rocks and many ancient craters. The dotted lines show the

boundaries of provinces, which are usually the ridges of high mountains

dividing one seismic region from another.
     If analyses of this catalogue show that it is of any value, it is clear

that several advantageous changes may be made in a system for its con-
tinuation. As it stands it is only a tentative effort to provide investi-
gators with a new kind of data, which may lead to investigations not
hitherto possible. None of the facts, excepting a few of the time obser-

vations, claim any great degree of accuracy. The object of the list drawn
up for me by Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz is explained in the next

section.

     The long list of corrections, additions, and suggestions at the end of
the volume, inasmuch as they have, so far as possible, been inserted in the
second catalogue, almost entirely refers to the first catalogue. Although
they show that actual errors occur in work of this description, they also

f.how that from given data different persons may arrive at differejit results.

                     ((') Object of the Catalogues.

The principal object of the catalogues, as we have indicated, is to

furnisli investigators with a certain quantity of material relating to the

occurrence of eaithquakes, different from that which has hitherto been at

their disposal, on account of the want of which it has been impossible to

make many desirable inquiries.

Many catalogues exist, like those of Perrey, Mallet, Kluge, de Bal-

lore, and Fuchs, in which the actual number of records are equal to, or

greater than, tlie number of earthquakes now noted, and which are

equally good as foundations for a particular class of investigations.

The incompleteness of these catalogues, however, is seen in the fact

that they give for the whole world a frequency less than the present

list gives for a small portion of it like Japan. If, for example, we take

Dr. C. W. C. Fuchs' ' Statistik der Erdbeben,' 1865 to 1885, giving a list of

some 8,000 disturbances, out of these Japan is credited with from three to

thirty shocks per year, while a truer estimate would have been from 500 to

1,000. Again, it is often difficult to distinguish between shocks which

have shaken a few square miles and those which have disturbed an empire.

Large shocks and small shocks, primary shocks and after shocks, are with

difficulty separable, and no data have been available enabling an investi-

gator to separate disturbances arising from the yielding of strata in one

area from those dute to fracturing which might take place in a neighbour-

ing region. Even when the lists of a particular observatory have been

examined by themselves, inasmuch as its records are those of shocks of

local orgin combined with those of shakings which originated at distances

of several hundreds of miles, all that we can expect to lind is a relation-

ship between earthquake occurrence and influences of a widespread

character. Such investigations have been made for the records of obser-

vatories, countries, and the world, with the result that a more or less

pronounced annual and semi-annual periodicity and traces of what is

apparently a lunar influence have been discovered.

No doubt many and very just objections may be made as to the

accuracy of much of tlie material in the present list ; but because it

enables us to give approximate lueiglds to the different shocks, to dis-

tinguish between primary and secondary disturbances, and to divide the

country to which it refers into distinct seismic or natural districts, it is

to be hoped that it will open the way for investigations along new lines.

Although the catalogues suggest several investigations hitherto impos-

sible, inasmuch as it so often hapj^ens that one inquiry becomes the

parent of another, it is impossible to indicate all the paths which may be

Afollowed.  suggestion given by the list, which shows that shocks

originating in Japan have travelled to Europe, is that a I'ing of twelve or

twenty-four stations situated round our globe would in a veiy short time

give us valuable information, not simply about its crust, but possibly also

about its interior.

One set of investigations which may possibly lead to interesting

results will be those relating to the frequency and periodicity of earth-

quake shocks which may be considered as having equal values, or receive

values relative to the area they have disturbed. Each of these analyses
may be made for Japan as a whole, or for special seismic disti'icts ; in the

former case the object being to determine whether the occurrence of
--154 EEPORT 1895.

earthquakes is dependent upon influences which simultaneously affect
Japan as a whole, and in the latter case to determine how far their

frequency may be related to phenomena of a more local character.
    As an example of an influence wliich affects Japan as a whole, the

difference in the summer and winter barometrical gradients crossing the
country may be taken, while tidal loads along the coast would be expected

to produce effects in difterent districts at diti'erent times.

     Not only is it open for us to determine effects due to external
influences, but these, so far as possible, must be distinguished from effects
resulting from internal conditions. The great frequency in District 7 was

entirely due to the shocks succeeding a terrible disturbance which took
place on October 28, 1891 ; and if these after shocks, which at first
occurred at the rate of 1,700 per month, and which ajjparently result
from the settlement of disjointed strata, are included in any general list,
it is clear that they might accentuate or destroy any law respecting a long

period frequency. What is true for District 7 is also true for District 11.
By themselves they yield information about the rate at which an enonnous

quantity of broken-up strata settles to a state of equilibrium, and because
the district around the ejiicentrum is for some time after the primary
disturbance in an extreme state of seismic sensibility, it is quite possible

that there may be fluctuations in the rate at which quiescence is ap-

proached, due to external influences. Other problems which suggest
themselves are the possible relationships between the seismic activity
of the various districts, the times taken for different areas under the
influence of secular movement to attain varying degrees of seismic sensi-
bility, and the connection between earthquake occurrence and the
geotectonic character of the country. If the object of an analysis is
to discover a relationship between earthquake frequency and exogenous
phenomena which recur at long intervals, it would .seem advisable to omit
long lists of after shocks, and only to take into consideratifin disturbances

which occur in districts whei'e seismic activity is in a normal state. On
the contrary, should we seek a relationship between the occurrence of

earthquakes and phenomena which recur at intervals of not more than
a few days, as, for example, barometrical fluctuations or the rising and

falling of the tide, this precaution is hardly necessary.

     ox THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC THENOMENA OF JAPAN. 155

     For the latter investigation, the most desirable lists to use would be
those referring to shocks originating beneath the ocean or r.long tlie sea-
board, and as an assistance to this I give the preceding table, showing the
times of high water at full and new moon on the coasts for the fifteen
seismic districts shown in the small map.

      Nothing has been said about the possible i-elationship between earth-

quakes and volcanic eruptions, first, because we have no reason to believe
that, with the exception of a few feeble shocks which may precede or
accompany an eruption, there is any marked direct connection Ijetween

these two phenomena, and secondly, because the present catalogue does
not extend over a sufficiently long period of years to lend itself to such
an investigation. Although one or two new investigations have been
here suggested, the principal work will be a repetition of old analyses,

taking advantage of the fact that we are now able to deal with natural
districts, to give earthquakes, where required, relative weigh f/i, and to

distinguish between after shocks, the occurrence df which is but little
influenced by epigenic actions of long periodicity, and those of a district
where seismic strain is in a normal condition.

     As to whether seismology will be advanced by carrying out these and
other inquiries which may present themselves is a question which
cannot yet be answered. It may be or it may not be, but the catalogue,

which could not have been compiled without the generous assistance of
the Royal Society of London and the kindness of the director and
officers of the Imperial Meteorological Department of Japan, by allowing
access to their unequalled store of valuable facts, will, it is hoped, settle
the question as to whether it is desirable to continue in its present
form the largest and probably the most perfect seismic survey which has
hitherto been attempted.

     I am glad to say that some of the features presented by the catalogues
are now being analysed by Dr. C. G. Knott, of Edinburgh.

   --After Shocks. About the time that the catalogue was commenced,

Mr. F. Omori undertook an examination of the shocks succeeding
the great earthquake of October 28, 1891. which are now indicated

upon the map in District No. 7. This he did, following up the in-

vestigation by an analysis of the disturbances since 1889 in District 11,
a series which recently occurred in District 10, and another series

belonging to a region lying between 8 and 9, which, although now
quiescent, about forty years ago was unusually active. As an outline of

 Mr. Omori's investigations is published in the ' Seismological Journal,'
 vol. iii. p. 71, and in greater detail in the 'Journal of the College of
Science,' vol. vii. Pai-t II., it would be out of place to give any detailed

reference to them here. Briefly, it seems that when a large disturbance
is followed by a long series of after shocks the number of these is roughly
proportional to the area first shaken, or what may provisionally be called
 the intensity of the initial impulse. The character of the curves which

 represent the freijuency of the after shocks in relation to time is
 remarkably similar, and having determined by observation the form of
 the eai'lier portions of a frequency curve, it seems possible to roughly
156 REPORT-- 1895.

calculate, not only the numljer of .shocks which will be experienced before

the district settles to its normal state of seismic activity, but also the

interval of time that will be involved in such an operation. For the

earthquakes considered by Mr. Omori it may be concluded that the

earth's crust had been so far fractured that there was an approximate

·similarity in the heterogeneity of the disjointed material, which tliere-

fore, as it settled, gave rise to after shocks following a somewhat similar
law. Another observation was that the larger of the after shocks

travelled to greater distances than their smaller companions, and in con-
sequence there was a marked difference in frequency at places situated
at different distances from the primitive origin. If there is any law in

this decrease in frequency with distance, then the frequency of what are

evidently after shocks observed upon a coast line, as in Districts 1 and 10,

might enable an observer to make a rough estimate of the distance of
an inaccessible submarine origin. That satisfactory results would be

obtained from such an investigation is, however, doubtful.

   --Distribution of Earthquakes. An inspection of the map of earth-

quake origins or centres shows that the central portions of Japan, which

fire the mountainous districts where active volcanoes are numerous, are

singularly free from earthquakes. The greater number of disturbances

originate along the eastern coast of the Empire, and many of these have
.a submarine origin. That very few earthquakes are shown on the coast

line between Districts 1 and 2 is in a great measure due to the fact that

in this region there are but few observing stations, the island of Yezo

Ain which these districts are situated being sparsely populated.  line

drawn from N.N.VV. to S.S.E., or from numbers 7 to 5.57, is the chief

anticlinal axis of the northern island, and from the southerly prolonga-

tion of this beneath the ocean, earthquakes from time to time originate,

which shake, not only the eastern coast of Yezo, but also many of the

districts on the main island. Although districts like 11, 9, 8, and then
through 7, suddenly northwards up to 13 or 14, lie along the strike line

of the southern portion of the Empire, a greater number of earthquakes
seem to originate from the face of the steep monoclinal .slope which Japan

presents towards the Pacitic Ocean.

Lines, 120 geographical miles in length, running in an easterly or

south-easterly clirection from the highlands of Japan into the Pacific

Ocean, like similar lines drawn from the Andes westwards into the same

·ocean, have a slope of 1 in 20 to 1 in 30, and in both of these districts

earthquakes are frequent. On the contrary, along the face of flexures

which are comparatively gentle, being less than half these amounts, which

may be seen along the borders of most of the continents and islands of

the world, earthquakes are comparatively rare. The inference from this

is that, where there is the greatest bending, it is there that sudden

yielding is the most frequent. In the case of many of the Japanese

·earthquakes, this takes place along the face of a monoclinal feature of

the world's surface, and the intimate relationship between monoclines and

.faults is known to all geologists, the former being, in the words of Sir

Archibald Geikie, an incipient stage of the latter.

   --Earthquakes and Secular Movements. Another feature indicated by

*he map or known to the writer from personal observation is that earth-

·quakes are frequent in those districts where there are evidences of secular

·elevation or depression, that is to say, in those di.sti'icts where movement

-of the earth's crust is yet slowly taking place.
ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. \o7

In Districts 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 the writer knows from repeated obser^a-

tion that there are evidences of very recent elevation, and certainly in
+ --these districts earthquakes are extremely frequent. The signs
                                     and

in the neighbourhood of Districts 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13, and along the

Inland Sea, lying to the north of 8 and 9, but to the south of 12, also

show a like relationship.

The only excejitions to the general rule appear to be the westerly

portion of the district between 12 and 13, where there are evidences of

secular movement, and earthquakes are of rare occurrence, and 1 in 5

cases where these conditions are I'eversed. The district No. 14 presents

a series of earthquakes originating along the line of a valley between

high mountains running from N.N.E. to S.S.W. Another good example

of earthquake fracturing following a line of weakness down a valley

between high mountains until it reached the plain was the disturbance

of October 28, 1891, which, as has been explained, resulted in the abnor-

mal conditions shown in District 7.

In Japan, therefore, earthquakes have been frequent along the steep

monoelinal face of the countiy, in the synclinal trough of deep valleys,

possibly along the continuation of the Yezo anticlinal, and in districts

where secular movement is in progress. In Italy earthquakes originate

along the anticlinal of the Apennines, and from what we know of the

geological history of the country, which had its greatest growth in

Tertiary times, and from the bradyseismic movements on the coast, it

is not unliirely that the shakings it experiences announce the fact that

secular yielding is yet in progress. The earthquakes of Switzerland and

those which shake the Himalayan, and the younger mountains of the

world, may also be taken as due to orogenic causes which seem to be so

After a volcanic explosion it might be expected that a sound wave

propagated through the atmosphere would succeed a trembling of the

ground.

    As the latter sign occurs but seldom, although there are one or two cases

of its occurrence in Districts 6, 7, 12, and 14, generally near active or old

volcanoes, and about two cases in District 8, it may be assumed that

earthquake sounds, rather than representing atmospheric waves radiating

from an epifocal area, represent elastic vibrations trani^mitted through

the ground, and therefoi-e arrive at a given station in advance of any

quasi-elastic surface undulation. Inasmuch as earthquake sounds only

travel a few miles from their origin, the intervals between them and an

earth movement which can be felt are very small. The result of this is

that it often appears that the two phenomena are simultaneous, and

therefore on the map we find nearly as many signs indicating 'sound with

ihock ' as those which indicate ' sound before shock.' Sounds are often

hsard which cause people to run from their houses, expecting a shock

which does not come. The dots on the map represent sounds which have

been to ordinary observers simultaneous with an actual shaking of thft
frrounrl. Taking the districts in order, we find the sound phenomena

distributed as follows :-

      1. Sounds fairly frequent on the coast at the most easterly and most
southerly portions of the district. Inland and on the northern coast they

are rare. This may indicate that the majority of earthquake origins lie

to the S.E. and are suljmarine.

 submarine. The coast between 2 and 3 is composed of soft materials.

 Paheozoic strata. Sounds are fairly frequent. In the southern part of 5,

 mountainous, while in the plain of Musashi, constituting the southern

 part, they are rarely heard.

      7. Amongst the Palieozoic hills of the district, and extending down
 into the plain, sound phenomena accompany about 30 per cent, of the

 disturbances.

 heard. Possibly the shocks originate beneath the ocean.

IV. On the Velocities with which Waves and Vibrations are

            PROPAGATED ON THE SURFACE OF AND THROUGH PtOCK AND
           Earth. (A Compilation.)

                                                       Introduction.

     Because the observations which have been made upon the rate at
which waves and vibrations are transmitted through rock and earth are
so varied and often apparently contradictory, it has been thought advisable
to select from the vast amount of material which is at our command a
series of illustrations from experiments upon artificially produced disturb-
ances, and from the records of actual earthquakes in which personal and

instrumental errors have been small.

   --Amongst the real or apparent difficulties are the following :

      1. Along the same path, earth waves, originating from a powerful
                           ----

     ox THK KARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHEXOMEXA OF JAPAN. 159

impulse, travel at a liisjlier rate than those resulting from an effort of
lower intensity. 2. Near to an origin, the velocity of propagation is greater
tlian it is between points at a distance. ''>. After a disturbance has

decreased in its speed of transmission it may be accelerated, and this

acceleration cannot be with certainty attributed to its having entered a

more elastic medium. 4. As an earthquake radiates, it is preceded by a

series of minute tremors, the velocity of propagation of which is certainly

A^ery much higher than that of the main disturbance.

(a) Artificialli/ produceadisturhances. 1. Experiments o/'Mr. R. Mallet,

     In the experiments of the late Robert Mallet conducted at Killiney
Bay, Dalkey, and Holyhead (' British Association Report,' 1861) the initial
impulse was caused by the explosion of cliarges of gunpowder. The
electrical contact which caused the explosion released a chronograph
which was stopped by a^i observer directly he saw, by means of a
microscope magnifying 11-39 times, an agitation caused by the resulting
waves in a dish of mercury. After corrections for the intervals of time
thus noted, in round numbers the results obtained were as follows :

In wet sand . . . .              0'25I km. per. sec.
In discontimious pranitc .
In more solid granite            0-:-598  ,,  ,,,,
In granite at Holyhead (mean) .           ,,  ,,,,

                                 0-371    ,.

     The charges of powder employed varied between 25 lb. and 12,000 lb.,
and with but one exception it was clearly shown that the velocity of wave
propagation increased with the force of the initial impulse. For example,
at Holyhead the relationship between the quantity of explosive and the
resulting velocities was as follows :

point well worthy of notice is the fact that the gunpowder waves had

a more gradual increase than those observed in shocks produced by

    In the experiments of MM. Fouque and Levy the velocity of vibrations

on the surface and underground was determined by recording the intervals
between the shock which was usually produced by the explosion of from
4 to 8 kilos, of dynamite, and the displacement of an image produced by
a I'ay of light on a photographic plate moving with uniform motion. The
ray of light was reflected from a surface of mercury at the receiving
station. The highest velocity was obtained between a point underground
and the surface, along a line of 383 metres in length, which gave a velocity
of 2,.526 meti-es. In this case the shock was due to an explosion of 8 kilos,

of dynamite.

     The general results obtained were as follows :

4. Observations of Frof. J. Milne and Prof. T. Gray.

In the author's experiments, which were commenced in conjunction

with Professor Thomas Gray in 1881, and continued at various times

during the next four years, the object was not simply to determine the

rate of transmission of earth waves, but also to determine their general

chai'acter. Usually the movements resulting from the fall of a heavy

weight, or the explosion of dynamite or gunpowder, were recorded by

seismographs. The weights employed varied from 1,7101b. to 2,000 1b.,

while the charges of dynamite, which were exploded in holes 8 or 10 feet

in depth, seldom exceeded 2 lb. Although the ground in all cases

excepting one was soft, tlie resultant vilirations up to distances of about

600 feet were sufficiently large to be recorded as clear diagrams by

bracket and other seismographs.

At various stations usually in a straight line joining them with tlie

focus of the explosion, seismographs were installed, which wrote their

movements on the smoked surface of a long plate of glass, the motion of

which was controlled by clockwork. One seismograph was placed so that

it wrote the movements parallel to the line of installation. These are

Acalled normal vibrations.        second seismograph was an-anged to

record the movements at right angles to such a direction. These

Aare called transverse vibrations.  vertical lever seismograph was

Aoccasionally employed to give the vertical motion.  fourth pointer

actuated by an electromagnet in connection with a short pendulum

swinging across mercury gave a broken line marking small but equal

intervals of time.

    By the depression of a contact key, the receiving plates at all the

stations were set in motion, the pointers of the seismographs drew fine

straight lines on the smoked surfaces, while the pendulum indicated

Aintervals of time.    few seconds later a second contact was made and

the charge exploded, and the seismographs gave open diagrams of the

resulting vibrations. When the earth motion had ceased, all tlie plates

were stopped and were ready to receive a second diagram without any

readjustments. One observer controlled all the stations, and the only
errors due to human interference may have arisen from slight differences

in the sensibilities given to the recording instruments. Tliis, however,

disappears when velocities were determined, not from the commencement

of a disturbance, but from the sharp commencement of the violent vibra-

tions or from the intervals of time between the appearance of particular

waves at the different stations.

Observations were also made with seismographs having single indices

by observing the disturbance created in similar dishes of mercury, and

with other arrangements.

The results of observations made I'especting velocity of propagation

were as follows :

      1. The velocity of transit of vertical vibrations near to an origin
decreases as a disturbance radiates. Normal vibrations, although they
have shown a decrease in velocitj' between the second and third stations,
have also shown a decided increase. This latter observation has been
marked with the transverse motions.

     2. Near to an origin the velocity of transit varies with the intensity

of the initial disturbance.

     3. In different kinds of grounds, with different intensities of initial
     ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC rHENOMEXA OF JAPAN. 103

disturbance, and with different systems of observation, I determined
velocities lying Ijetween 630 (192 m.) and about 200 (61 m.) feet per

second.

    4. In my experiments the vertical free surface wave had tJie quickest

rate of transit, the normal being next, and the transverse motion being

the slowest.

     T). The rate at which the normal motion outraces the transverse
motion is not constant.

    6. As the amplitude and period of the normal motion approach in

value to those of the transverse motion, so do the velocities of transit of
these motions approach each other.

                                (6) Observations on Earthquakes.
     The observations quoted in this section commence with those where
the wave paths have not been more than a few hundred feet from station
to station. These arc followed by the results obtained from instruments
separated from each other by distances of from three to six miles, a few
hundred miles and so on up to velocities determined over paths equal to
a quarter of the earth's circumference.

1. Observations in Japan.

For several years the author took diagrams of earthquakes at seven

stations, each about 900 feet apart. These stations were in electrical

connection, so that one pendulum marked time intervals upon each of the

moving sui'faces upon which diagrams were being drawn. From tifty sets

of diagrams, representing fifty different earthquakes, it was only in five

instances that the same wave could be identified at the different stations.

The result of these identifications led to calculation of velocities of 1,787,

1,302. 1,825, 869, and 501 metres per second.

Even these determinations cannot be accepted without reserve,

because it is found that waves may spread out as they pass from station

to station, a given wave splitting up into two waves, &c. Hence a

velocity calculated from a ivave (a) may be different from a velocity of a
leave (b), and yet both are -part of the same disturbance. In the diagram
from one station a large wave may have a slight notch upon its crest, at

another station this notch is seen to have increased in size, while at a

third station it is so large that the single wave appears as two waves.

As in the artificially produced disturbances, although an earthquake

becomes feebler as it radiates, it apparently increases in its duration.

The same system of observation has recently been elaborated in

Japan, but the distances between stations have been increased to several

miles. Because the commencement of a disturbance at a given station

varies with the sensibility given to the seismograph, the determinations

of velocity depend upon the identification of particular waves upon the

Updiagrams obtained from at least three stations.  to the present this

has only been possible on one or two occasions. On November 30, 1894,

at 8.30 p.m., a velocity of 5 km. per second was obtained, other dis-

turbances giving from 2'4 to 3"6 km. per second.

The following are examples of velocity determinations made in Japan

between stations which have access to the telegraphic system of the

country, and which are provided with seismographs and clocks which
                                                                                             M2 '

automatically record the time at which a particular vibration was drawn.

At each of the observatories it is therefore possible to calculate the

instant at which a given instrument commenced to write its record.
     In 1891, on December 9 and 11, strong shocks originated in the

province of Noto on the west coast, which were observed in Gifu, Nagoya,
and Tokio. The mean velocity determined from these records was
2"31 km. per second.

     The destructive disturbance of October 28, 1891, which was recorded
in Europe, was followed by many after shocks, the times of arrival of
seventeen of which were accurately noted at Osaka, Nagoya, Gifu, and
Tokio. The origin of the main shock was about five miles to the west of
Gifu. To reach Tokio, a distance of 151 miles, took 120 seconds. The
average time taken for all eighteen shocks was 118 seconds, and the
average velocity was 2-40 Lm. per second, the rate of transmission to
Osaka being the same as it was over the much longer path to Tokio.

     The primary disturbance seems to have reached Shanghai at a rate of
about 1'61 km. per second, and Berlin at about 2-98 km. per second.
For the Shonai shock on October 22, 1894, as a mean obtained by the
method of least squares from observations at ten stations from 60 to 300
miles distant from the origin, a velocity of about 1*95 km. per second was

obtained.

     Giving these last determinations, all of which were computed by
Mr. F. Omori, weights proportional to the number of observations each
represents, the average rate at which disturbances are propagated over
long distances in Japan is 7,560 feet, or 2 3 km. per second, a rate which
fairly well agrees with that at which the large waves of similar dis-
turbances travel from Japan to Europe.

?. Observations along Wave Paths of Great Leiigth.

Next we will turn to earthquakes which have been noted at distances

from their origins greater than those at which it has been possible to

--obser\e in Japan a notable example of which are the observations made

at the time of the Charleston Earthquake on August 31, 1886. Over

A400 ol)servations were made.  number of these were obtained from

clocks which had been stopped, and as many of these were regulators

which had daily been compared with a time signal, there is no reason to

doubt their accuracy. All these observations, which were made on wave

paths between 300 and 924 miles in length, were subjected to a rigorous

analysis by Professor Simon Newcomb and Captain Charles Dutton, with

the result that an average velocity of 5,184 m. was determined, and there

was no indication of any sensible variation in speed. Considering the

phase of motion which in the majority of instances was in all probability

observed, this result is remarkably high.

   A valuable study of the rate at which vibrations may be propagated

through the earth's crust is one made by Dr. G. Agamennone of a series

of shocks which in 1893 had their origin near to the island of Zante.

These were recorded at the various stations mentioned along the foot of

the diagram Fig. 15, the one farthest from the origin being Potsdam. The

lengths of the various wave paths are indicated in kilometres. The time

intervals naeasured vertically are on a scale of 20 seconds per millimetre.

For five shocks straight lines connect a series of points indicating the

differences in time between the occurrence of the shock near to its origin

and the time at which maximinn motion was experienced at the various

stations.

     The dotted lines connect similar points for the commeiiceiiifiti of the
disturbance. The time of these commencements undoubtedly varied with
the sensibilities of the recording instruments, and therefore it will be
noticed that they have only been taken into account for Rome, Xicolaiew,

                                                                    Fig. 15.

and Strassburg, where records were obtained from the great pendulum of
the Collegio Romano, or from the horizontal pendulums of Dr. E. von

Rebeur-Paschwitz.

     The principal object in reproducing this series of observations is to see
if there is any reason for believing that there is any variation in the
velocity with which a given disturbance is propagated.
                        --

166 REPORT-- 1895.

     In examining this diagram it must be remembered that near to an

origin tlie difference in time between the maximum phases of an earth-
quake and its actual commencement may be only a few seconds, while at

a great distance the I'ecords of sensitive instruments show that the same

interval may be many minutes. When instruments of such sensibility
are near to an origin, my own observations seem to show tliat they are

not set into any sensible amount of motion before the ordinary seismo-
scopes or seismographs, and thei'efore for places comparatively near to
the origin of a disturbance, when observations were made with the latter

type of instrument, I should be inclined to think that the phases of

maximum motion might be approximately coincident with the times of

commencement of movement.

   --An inspection of the diagram points towards the following results :

     No. 1. The velocity for the first 5")0 km. is greater than it is to a
point which is more remote.

     No. 2. This is the only disturbance for whicli observations are made
at points comparatively near to the epicentre, for which they show a
very high velocity. Between stations distant 300 aiid 1,100 km. from
the origin the velocity decreases, but beyond this limit it apparently

increases.

     No. 3. The chief difference between this and No. 2 is that the point of
inflexion of a free curve drawn between the points of observation, instead
of being at a distance of 1,100 km. from the epicentre, is at about
1,300 km. from tliat point.

     No. -t. The velocity is apparently greater at a distance from the epi-
centre than near to it.

     No. 5. This resembles No. 4.

     If we omit the one case which shows a high velocity in the immediate

--neighbourhood of the ^irigin which, however, is in perfect accordance

--with results obtained with artificially produced disturbances there

remains the clearly marked observation that to Catania and Mineo the
velocities are, as compared Avith the rate of propagation to more distant
stations, relatively low. Professor A. Ricco, who discusses these observa-

tions, gives us every reason to believe that tlie time observations at

Catania are correct, while those at Mineo may bs in error, owing to the
manner in which it receives the time signals from Eome, which finally

reach the observatory by circolare.
      Professor Ricco concludes that the low velocity between Zante and

Catania may Ije accounted for by the fact that the motion was entirely

transmitted tln'ough watei-, because the velocity recorded of 1,439 km. per
second practically coincides with that of a sound wave in water. Professor
Ricco adds that Bertelli lias shown that the shocks of eartliquakes felt on

shipboard and the sound waves have been simultaneous. From one of
Abbot's experiments, howe^'er, we have seen that a wave velocity obtained

from a water path was greatly increased.
     The following is Agamennone's table of velocities, which, although

they represent averages, show that the lowest is the one on August i,
which had the shortest range :
O.V THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCAMC I'HENOMENA 01'' JAIWX. 167
               --

--168 KEPORT 1895.

      Dr. Agamennone, after examining the data on which these tables are
founded, shows that the conclusion to which they point disappears if the
time taken at Cadiz by the stopping of two clocks was a minute too late,
while the times at Greenwich and other observatories correspond to the
beginning of the motion. From the calculations of Offret relating to the
Ligurian earthquake of February 23, 1887, it would appear that the
velocity of propagation increased as a disturbance radiated, but such

anomalies may also be explained by the assumption that there were errors

in the time observations near to the epicentre.

    As another indication of what is apparently the reverse of the results
adduced by Dr. Cancani, we may take either the earthquakes of Zante or

the following Japanese earthquakes, observed in Europe by Dr. E. von
Rebeur-Paschwitz :

mencement of movement by the more sensitive classes of instrument, the
records from which also give the lower values, if the arrival of the dis-

turbances is taken as being the time when they recorded jnaximum phases

of motion.

     As a last example of the different results which may be obtained from
the same record, I take that observed at Rocca di Papa on March 23,

1894. The shock originated beneath the ocean about 70 miles S.E. of
Nemuro, on the north-east coast of Yezo (Lat. 42° N., Long. 146° E.).
It was observed at Nemuro in Greenwich mean time at 10.20.45 a.m.

     The times at Rocca di Papa and the resulting velocities were as

follows :

    First tremors,    JO.36.0 G.M.T. 11-35 km. per .sec.

     In Tokio it was observed at 10.27.40 G.M.T., after which four after-
shocks were noted, The average time difference between the oUservations

at Tokio and Nemuro was fi min. 43 sec, and the difference in their

distances from tlie origin is about GOO miles, from which an average
velocity of about 2-3 km. per second is calculated. If it is assumed that
the first tremors reached Rocca di Papa by direct radiation along a chord

or through the earth, then their velocity may be reduced to 8 or 10 km.

per second (see example on p. 149).

                                                                 3. Conclusions.

     Very many records might be added to those which have been given,
 but it does not seem likely that, until we are in possession of a series of

 records taken at long distances apart on the surface of our globe by means
 of instruments ivMch are similar, which have sufficient sensibility to record
 preliminary tremors, and which record upon surfaces moving sifficienthj
 quickly to alloxv of accurate time determinations, that our present know-
 ledge \yill be greatly increased. Because the waves of a disturbance change
in period as they travel, while one wave breaks up to form two or more
waves, and this even in ground which is apparently homogeneous, a given

earthquake may show as many velocities as there are waves between which
we choose to make measurements. What we know from experiments, and
what we should expect from a priori reasoning, is that the rate at which a
disturbance is propagated varies with the nature of the medium through

which it is ti-ansmitted. Experiments have shown that the vibrations fol-
lowing an artificial disturbance, where the initial impulse has been strong,
travel more quickly than those where the originating cause has been feeble;
also that there is apparently a higher velocity very near to an origin than
at a distance. The latter phenomenon seems to find confirmation in the

records of certain earthquakes. Although it may be difficult to interpret
the meaning of these latter observations, when we endeavour to find an

explanation for the existence of the long series of preliminaiy tremors
which are recorded at places nearly a quarter of the earth's circumference
from an origin, and which have apparently reached these places by travel-
ling at rates of 9 to 12 km. per second, the difficulties which confront

phenomena.

     (c) On the Prohahle JVature and Vdocitij of Propaijation of the
          Movements resulting from an Earthquake Disturhance.

If it is assumed that the crust of the eartli has the character of an

isotropic elastic solid, then from an earthquake centrum two types of

Avaves may emanate. In one of these the direction of vibration of a

particle is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave or normal

to its fi'ont, as in a sound wave, whilst in the other it is transverse to such

a direction, or, so far as this character is concerned, it is like the move-
ments in a ray of light.

    These two types of movements, which are respectively known as
condensational and distoi'tional waves, are j^ropagated with different

velocities, which depend upon certain elastic moduli and the density of the

material.

These velocities may he respectively expressed by the quantities

\/' mjp  and  s/ njp,  where                           is the  density  of  the  material, n the modulus
                                                   i>

of rigidity or resistance to distortion, and ni a modulus depending upon

the modulus of rigidity and the bulk modulus or resistance to compression

+k, which is equal to k \n.

     The first conclusion to which the theory leads is that the condensa-
tional wave has a higher velocity than the distortional wave, and therefore
the first ought to outrace the latter. With artificially produced disturb-

ances at jwints near to origins in fairly homogeneous earth, a phenomenon

similar to this has been observed, but whether the preliminary tremors

preceding more decided movements observed at great distances represent

condensational waves propagated from an origin is yet uncertain. I'rom

experiments made in conjunction with Professor T. Gray to determine the

elastic moduli of granite, marble, tufl', clay rock, and slate, and the veloci-

ties with \\hich normal and transverse movements have been projDagated

in alluvium. Dr. C. G. Knott drew iip the following table as representing
aAerage constants involved when determining the velocities with which

di.sturbances may be propagated through fairly solid rocks :

     Density . , . . , . .                                                  p=3

         Eatio of t lie wave moduli                    . . . mjn = o

    With the above numbers the velocity of a distortional wave would
be 2-235 km. per second, while the condensational wave would have a
value about double this quantity. Should we accept the i-ecords made of
decided movements which had their origin in Japan, but which have been

recorded in Europe as representing distortional waves, then our expecta-
tions based upon theory closely accord with what has been observed.

    On the other hand, because it has been shown that small vibrations

have been noted which have travelled at rates of from 9 to 12 km. per

second, the fact must not be overlooked that we are not yet in possession

of sufficient constants to apply the theory to all the cases which have been

observed. Even if we had the constants referring to the elasticity and
density of material in the interior of our earth, when we consider the

heterogeneity of the materials through which a disturbance probably
passes, as Dr. C. G. Knott and other writers point out, there are serious

objections to the assumption that waves with a high velocity are due
to the transmission of normal motions, while those with a lower velo-

city represent the less rapid transversal vibrations. At every boundary

between two media different in tlieir elasticity, either a condensational or
a.distortional wave is broken up into reflected and refracted distortional
waves as well as reflected and refracted condensational waves, and thei'e-
fore as a disturbance travels through the heterogeneous mass of materials
constituting the earth's crust there is, in every probability, a continual

change in the cliaracter of the motion.

     Not only does tliis consideration make it appear unlikely that the
tremors which have been observed at stations far removed from an origin

if they were propagated on or near to the surface of the earth are due to
condensational waves, while the more pronounced movements which
succeed them represent the distortional waves, but it also indicates that
at a given station there should be no definite relationship between the
motion of an earth particle and the direction of propagation of an earth-
quake. For feeble earthquakes, and for those recorded at points outside a
megistoseismic area, this latter conclusion is remarkably concordant with

observation.

    On the other hand, however, if preliminary tremors are movements
which have been transmitted at great depths through a medium where

"^ e/p is constant or changes gradually, it is likely that they have a con-
densational character.

    Next we may consider the probable nature of surface waves. Lord

Rayleigh, in a paper on waves propagated along the plane surface of an
Elastic Solid, ^ investigates 'the behaviour of waves upon the plane free
surface of an infinite homogeneous isotropic elastic solid, their character

being such that a disturbance is confined to a superficial region of thick-

ness comparable with the wave-length. The case is thus analogous to

that of deep water waves, only that the potential energy here depends

upon elastic resilience instead of upon gra'S'ity.'

ATwo cases are discussed, but the results are very similar.  particle

at the surface moves in an elliptic orbit with its major axis perpendicular.

The displacement parallel to the plane surface penetrates into the solid

for an incompi-essible solid about the eighth of a wave-length, and to

about the fifth into the solid when the Poisson ratio has a value of one-

fourth. The surface waves aie propagated at a slightly slower rate than

a purely distortional wave is propagated.

From observations made upon earthquakes near to their origin, it

seems that when vertical motion appears it is accompanied by horizontal

displacements greater than that required by the formula given by Lord

Rayleigh, but the question arises whether the accepted horizontal move-

ments are not more apparent than real, being displacements due to tilting

of the recoi'ding instruments. That at the time of a strong earthquake

surface waves have an existence, because they have been seen, been felt,

and been recorded by instruments, is a fact not to be disputed. As they

spread the distance between crest and crest apparently increases, and

calculations have been made to detei^mine their height and length. About

the path described by a constituent particle nothing has yet been experi-

mentally determined. The decided movements which have been recorded

at great distances from their origin, which have been referred to as possibly

being distortional waves, because tlaey slowly tilt pendulums from side to

side, are not unlikely to be long flat undulations ivJiich near to the origin

were decided surface waves. If this is the case, the phenomenon to be

--172 REPORT 1895.

investigated is not the transversal vibrations of a truly elastic solid, but it
is a quasi-elastic surface disturbance, the propagation of which is accele-
rated by the influence of gravity.

    The preliminary tremors have, however, yet to be explained. At

stations within 100 miles of an origin, as recorded by seismographs, these

--outrace the main disturbance with which, however, they are invariably
--connected and often overlap it, by perhaps ten seconds. At a distance

of 6,000 miles they seem to outrace it by half an hour.
     Dr. C. G. Knott suggests that they are due to the quasi-elastic dis-

turbances which accompany earthquakes. When the earth movement is

violent, and possibly accompanied by destruction, the material of the
earth's surface is either strained beyond its limit of elasticity, or at least
so far strained that the resulting movements are governed by coefficients

other than those due to rigidity and compressibility. As these quasi-

elastic waves pass through a region of discontinuity, or as they lose

energy, they may be suddenly or gradually transformed into a purely

elastic disturbance.

    Although changes of this description may take place as a disturbance
passes from medium to medium, inasmuch as it implies the creation of
tremors as the surface waves progress, much in the same way that a

trotting pony or a railway train creates the sound waves which run before
them, we are led to the conclusion that the preliminary tremors have a

velocity very much higher than those already calculated. Because this

cannot be accepted, the only explanation remaining is the assumption
that the preliminary tremors are movements originating at an earthquake
centrum and propagated possibly as condensational waves along paths yet
to be discussed through our earth. If this is made, then apparent velocities

of 11 or \'l km. per second, as observed for example on March 22, 1894,
may be reduced to actual velocities of about 9 km. per second.

     Should a more extended and systematic observation confirm this pro-

visional assumption, we shall then be in a position to discuss from a new

point of view the physical nature of the materials constituting the interior
of our globe which apparently transmits motion at a greater rate than

glass or steel.

     Points not yet touched upon are the increase of velocity with an
increase in the intensity of the initial disturbance, and a decrease in
velocity as a disturbance radiates, both of which phenomena are marked
near to the origin of artificial disturbances. The only explanation which
suggests itself for both these phenomena is that around the epicentrum
there is a region to which motion is communicated partly by elastic yield-

ing and partly as a push. The volume of ground which may be thus

disturbed is called by my late colleague, Professor T. Alexander, an earth-

quake core. In the case of an artificial disturbance originating near to
the surface, the distance to which this effect extends will depend upon the

suddenness and magnitude of the initial disturbance. With an earth-

quake originating underground, the distance to which a high epifocal

velocity may be noticeable will not only dei^end upon the above two con-

ditions, but also upon the depth of the focal origin. The greater this

latter quantity becomes, the greater will be the radius of the epicentral

area in which there may be not only a real increase in velocity but also a

high ajjparent velocity.

     The conclusion to which these considerations and the observations
which have been made lead is that an earthquake gives rise to at least
     ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 173

three kinds of movements, each of which has a different velocity of

propagation. On the surface of the earth there is an undulatory motion
which from the researches of Lord Rayleigh we might expect to travel at a

rate slightly slower than a distortional wave, but as pointed out by
Lord Kelvin it is probable that this rate is accelerated by the influence of

gravity. What we should expect and what we find are therefore fairly in
accordance. From a centrum to various points upon the surface of the
earth we should expect truly elastic waves to be propagated, the velocities
of which would vary along paths of varying depths. At great depths, as

for example along a straight or curvilinear path between Japan and
Europe, the velocity of propagation might be higher than that of a con-
densational rarefactional wave in glass, and exceedingly high velocities

have apparently been observed. Lastly, in an epifocal area there may be

instantaneous disturbance or an apparent high velocity due to bodily
displacement within an earthquake core and the transmission of elastic
and quasi- elastic vibrations, or to the combination of such phenomena.

                     {d) The Faths followed hy Earthquake Motion.

    What has next to be considered are the paths by which an earthquake

originating at a centrum reaches various points upon the sui-face of the

globe.

     Three hypotheses present themselves. Motion may reach various

points on the earth's surface along the rectilinear wave paths of Hopkins
or Seebach, by curvilinear paths as suggested by Dr. A. Schmidt, or lastly
by either of these paths, after which from an epifocal area the radius of
which is not likely to exceed the focal depth, there is a transmission on the

surface of elastic gravitational waves.

     Before discussing the merits of these hypotheses, it may be well first to

consider the case or cases to which they are applicable.
     Because we have no evidence of a disturbance being simultaneously

felt at a number of places on the surface of our globe and at their anti-
podes, and for other reasons, we may exclude the idea of a disturbance
having originated near to the centre of our sphere. Nor can it be admitted

that a disturbance originated at half or quarter such a depth, for if it did
so, then in an epicentral area, possibly 400 miles in diameter, apparent
velocities should have been observed which not only would be enormously
high, but would be at least five times greater than those observed between
more distant stations.

     From what we know respecting the causes of earthquakes, it is a

reasonable supposition to imagine that their origins are confined to the
crumpling of a superficial layer of the material constituting the crust
of our globe, which according to the Rev. O. Fisher and other investi-

gators, in all probability does not exceed thirty miles in thickness. The
enormous faulting which has accompanied certain disturbances shows that
at least a portion of the initial impulse was delivered actually at the
surface. About the depth to which such faults have descended or the
mean depth from which an earthquake has originated, we have no certain
 information. Confining our considerations to disturbances which have
originated at depths which are extremely small relatively to the radius of
 our earth, we may now turn to the hypotheses respecting earthquake

 radiation.
--174 REPORT 1895.

        1. Hypotheses of Hupldns and Seebach.

In 1847 Hopkins drew attention to the fact that the velocity with

which a wave passes from one point of the surface of the earth to another
point is only an apparent horizontal velocity which may be denoted as v.
For example, if in fig. 16 the origin of a disturbance be O, C be its

epicentre on the surface of the earth H' H, and Op, Opj be the direction of

two earthquake rays, then the apparent velocity is the distance p, p.,
divided by the time interval between the observations at the two points

p, andp,,. During this interval the distance travelled by the wave within
the earth has been sp.2.

   VThe true velocity which may be called is that with which it travels

        Fig. ]G.              within the earth, as, for example,

                              between the centrum and the epi-

                              centre. To show the relationship

                              between these two velocities it is

                              assumed that the true velocity is

                              constant. On this assumption if C)
                              is a centrum, wave fronts may be

                              represented by circles of coseismals,

                              the distances apart of alternate

                              members of which are equal and

                              represent the distance travelled

                              in unit time, which for conveni-

                              ence may be taken at one second.

                              YThe true velocity  is therefore

                              equal to spj, while the apparent

                              velocity recorded on the surface

                                                    is Pi p.,. Erom the construction
                                                     sp2=pi p2 sin W, or V=^v sin B.
     From this it follows that for points near to the epicentre C, the
apparent velocity is very much greater than the true velocity, while

between points at some distance from C tlie two velocities tend to become

equal to each other. The law of this decrease in the apparent velocity is

shown geometrically by drawing Seebach 's hyperbola, which runs from C

through a series of ordinates the lengths of which are equal to the

differences between the time at which C was shaken and p, p^, etc, were

disturbed. The asymptote to this curve intersects the seismic vertical ac

the origin, and therefore if we are satisfied with the hypothesis, having
given a number of time observations and knowing the position of the
epicentre, the method may be used for determining tlie depth of a seismic

focus.

This hypothesis indicates why a disturbance should apparently be pro-

pagated with a high velocity near to its epicentre, but that this rapidly

approaches a constant value.

                                                2. Hypothesis of Schmidt.

    As pointed out by Dr. A. Schmidt, directly we deal with an earthquake
which has been propagated over a great distance it is necessary when

constructing the velocity curve to take into consideration the curvature
of the earth.

     This curve (fig. 17), which has lost its hyperbolic character, shows by
                                                                                                    >

     ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 1 / }

the convexity of its upjiei- part that after a decrease in velocity in the
epicentral regions at great distances the veh)city again increases to

become infinite. Dr. Schmidt has Ukewise shown that actual observations
which have been made upon earthquakes are best satisfied by a velocity
curve drawn on the supposition that the actual velocity within the earth

                                                                   Fig. 17.

is not a constant, but varies with a change in elasticity and density of the

rocks through which the waves are propagated.

As we descend in depth on account of an increasing temperature it is

probable that with other changes there is a change in the elastic moduli of

rocks. This being admitted, it then follows that a series of waves start-

ing from a centrum would be propagated at a greater rate downwards than

upwards towards the surface, while the normals to such a series of waves

would by refraction gradually be bent upwards.

As illustrative of what would occur under the supposed conditions,

Dr. Schmidt gives a diagram like fig. 18,       ^^^ '^^-
in which coseismals have been drawn, on

the assumption that the velocity has in-         __+
creased proportionately with the depth. In
this case the earthquake rays which are         :::.1.t.]
perpendicular to successive coseismals are

by refraction turned upwards, and no

longer radiate in straight lines. The co-

seismals meet the surface at intervals,

which first decrease from the epicentre

and then increase, indicating a decrease

and then an increase in the apparent ve-

locity. The value for v is never less than

the velocity at the centre, but after rapidly

decreasing until it equals this value, it again

increases. The velocity curve or earthquake hodograph which shows these
changes is drawn through points determined as they were determined for
Seebach's hyperbola. If there is an increase in the velocity of propaga-
tion of earth waves or in the quantity t/p as we descend beneath the

surface, whether we take the centrum near to the surface or at a great
176 REPOKT--1895.

depth, the resulting hodograph retains its character. Although the evi-
dence that there is an increase in the velocity of propagation of waves as

we trace thera beneath the sui'face is by no means so complete as might

be desii-ed (see p. 161), Dr. Schmidt compares the advantages whicli the
curvilinear propagation presents over that of the rectilinear transmission

employed by Seebach.
      It will be observed that in fig. 18 there is a great concentration of

earthquake rays in the epifocal region which would correspond to the
destruction which is so noticeable in such districts, while with rectilinear

radiation the absence of such concentration is not in accord with the
results of experience. Although both hypotheses agree iji showing a
higher apparent velocity near to the epicentre, in Seebach's hyperbola an
identical limit is reached for the apparent horizontal velocity for all
earthquakes, while Schmidt's modification of the laws shows that the
apparent velocity on the surface cannot be less than that between the

focus and the first coseismal, with which it varies. From this it follows

that for limited areas the latter method admits the possibility of very high
A-elocities resulting from earthquakes originating at reasonable depths.

With rectilinear propagation on the contrary, to obtain such high veloci-

ties as have been observed, it is necessary that origins should be situated

at enormous depths.
      Should a disturbance originate near the surface, Schmidt's hodograj^h

consists of two symmetrical concave branches which meet in an angle at
the centre, indicating that the velocity increases from the epicentre

outwards.

     After indicating the above and other advantages presented by the
hodograph over the hyperbola as representing the velocity with which
earth waves are apparently propagated. Dr. Schmidt takes a number of
earthquakes for which good time observations have been obtained and
plots the resulting curves. These which refer to earthquakes felt over
moderate areas show the characteristic inflexion point denoting an

increased velocity in the outer portion of the disturbed tract.

   --The following are examples of his results :--

     Middle Germany, March 6, 1872. Longest wave path 400 km.
Here the hodograph is distinct in character with a point of inflexion at
about 11 miles from its vertex, having a slope indicating a velocity of
2-5 miles per minute. At a distance of 36-7 miles the velocity is 15 miles
per minute. The curve passes much more closely through the points
representing time and distance than the hyperbola of Seebach. Possible
depth, 5 to 10 miles. Mallet's method, dependent upon a single observation,

--gives 1-9 to 2-9 miles.
     Herzogenrath, October 22, 1873. Longest wave path 150 km. In
this case the hodograph is practically concave, throughout its length
indicating an origin near the surface. It is indicated over a radius of

17 miles. Possible depth is less than 3 km. By Seebach's method it may

be from to 14 km.

   --Swiss Earthquake, January 7, 1887. Longest wave path, 150 km.

The f'eneral character of this hodograph is like the last. At the point

of inflexion the velocity is 170 m. per second, and at 150 km. it is
1,300 m. The depth of the centrum is from 1 to 6 km.

   --Charleston Earthquake, August 31, 1886. Longest wave path,

1,500 km. Here the hodograph is nearly a straight line. The depth
of the centrum may exceed 120 km.
     ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCAMC rHEJsOMEXA OF JAPAA'. 177

      In the case of tlie first three of these examples, their hodograpliic

character may be due to the fact that observations were made in epifocal

areas, within which disturbances radiating from a centrum were recorded
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but in the last example this character has been lost, because most of the
times which were noted probably refer to the arrival of a surface disturb-
ance capable of being felt, and which might have been recorded by ordinary

seismograplis.

     These latter records are therefore such that we could not expect them
to conform with the hypothesis under consideration, and until a number

of stations separated by long distances are provided with instruments

capable of recording minute tremors which may go through the earth.

Until these have been established, it would seem that the confirmation of
the attractive theory put forward by Dr. Schmidt must lemain in abeyance.

3. A Suggestion that there are three Classes of Jfovement.

The last hypothesis is one that takes into consideration three classes of

movements wliich immediately round an epicentre are hopelessly confused.

These are the truly elastic disturbances which from a focus reach the

surface of the earth along rectilinear or curvilinear paths, forced displace-

ments, and quasi-elastic waves, causing tumultuous movements in the

centre of a megistoseismic area, and long undulatory elastic-gravity waves

which are propagated over the surface of the earth.

The escape of energy is most pronounced along the paths of least

resistance, that is round the seismic vertical to an epifocal area, and then

radially over the surface of the globe. The rate of propagation of the

surface waves seems to be about "J or 3 km. per second, and it may be

fairly constant. The minute tremors which have been observed at

stations 6,000 miles distant from their originating cause, if they travelled

through the superficial crust of the earth they did so at a rate of perhaps

12 km. per second, while if they were created on the passage, their

velocity, which is increased, becomes more abnormal. Assuming that they

came as condensational waves tln'oiigh the earth, then their velocity

is reduced to 8 or 10 km. per second, a quantity which, as suggested

by Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz, may possibly throw new light upon the-

nature of materials constituting the interior of our earth. At present

the facts bearing upon this latter question are both few and imperfect. To

confirm or dispel the important conclusions indicated by the few facts at

our disposal, it would seem desirable that investigations should be extended

in such a manner that the results obtained by different observers would be

comparable. With a set of stations situated round the globe at intervals

of 1.^)° or 30° apart, provided with instruments similar in character,,

similarly installed and similarly worked, which are capable of recording

not simply small changes in level but also minute vibrations, we might

easily extend our present knowledge, not simply respecting the propaga-

tion of surface undulations, but possibly of motion transmitted through

the rigid globe. An indication of the latter phenomenon would be an

enormous increase in the apparent velocity of a disturbance as it approached

the antipodes of its origin, while the concentration of energy in such a

region would suggest internal refraction.

< )ther phenomena which might be recorded would be the diurnal and

longer period wanderings of the instruments, local eai'thquakes and eartli

tremors. The latter, although important in themselves, because they so

the instruments, Ije as far as possible minimised.

                                 (e) Conclusions.

     If we except the curious results respecting the velocity of propagation
of motion which we might expect to find, and which apparently exists in
an epifocal area, the phenomenon of greatest interest, the study of which
may lead us to important conclusions respecting the physical constitution

of the interior of our globe, are the so-called preliminary tremors of earth-
quakes which are often continued as superimposed serrations on the quasi-
elastic motions. In Japan these have been recorded and studied for the
last 15 years, but it has only been within the last year or two that their

appearance has been recognised in Europe.

     All that I know about these latter records is what I learn by letters
from Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz, and what I have seen in the publica-
tions of Dr. Agamennone and other Italian observers, and the conclusion
is that these tremors are the reappearance of a phenomenon which has for
so many years puzzled seismologists in Japan. If this is so, and if they

really possess the abnormally high velocities attributed to them, seismo-

logists may be on the verge of probing our earth to depths greater than

it was thought probable that the study of earthquakes could possibly lead.

Although something farther may yet be learned by studying the elastic
gravitational surface disturbances, we know that whether they are recorded

on paths of about 600 miles in length in Japan, or on paths of 6,000 miles
in length between Japan and Europe, they travel at a rate of about

?> km. per second. All that is now required is to increase the accuracy of

the observations by adopting such methods of noting the arrival of these
disturbances that the records at each station i-efer to the same phase of

motion.

   V. Miscellaneous Notes eelatixg to Large Earthquakes, itc.

   --1. Large Earthqiialcps. During the past twelve months Japan has

been visited by several destructive earthquakes, seismographic records of
which are given in the list of shocks recorded by the Gray-Milne seismo-
graph in Tokio. The velocities with which certain of these disturbances
were propagated in Japan will be found in the fourth section of this

report. At least three of the shocks were recorded in Europe, and to

determine the velocities with which they were propagated diagrams and
notes relating to observations made in Japan have been forwarded to Dr.
E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz and Dr. P. Tacchini. The most notable dis-

turbances were as follows.

     June 20, 1894. Preference was made to this shock in the report for
1894. In Tokio it was felt very severely, destruction being equally great
amongst foreign-built brick buildings on the high ground, and amongst

similar structures in the foreign concession on the low ground. An ex-

cellent diagram, obtained from a seismograph without multiplication, has
been published in the 'Journal of the College of Science ' (Imperial Uni-
versity of Japan). The after shocks were extremely few in number.

                                                                                                                     N2
180 Kf:roRT-- 1895.

     October 22, 1894, .1.20 p.m. Tliis shock, which created great destruc-
tion within an area not more than thirty miles in diameter round Shonai

on the N.W. coast of the main island, does not appear to have been recorded

by the Oray-Mihie seismograph in Tokio.
     The destruction it occasioned in the vicinity of its origin was enormous.

More than 300 people lost their lives, while in some respects the country
was more fissured and broken up than it was around Gifu in 1891, at which
time nearly the whole of Japan was sensibly shaken. Sand hills or dunes,
which have a breadth of 3,000 to 4,000 feet at their base, were fissured and
sunk along their crests for a breadth of between 200 and 300 feet, and these

openings extended for several miles. Fissures of great length were formed
in the plains, whilst water and sand were shot upwards, and ring-like
craterlets produced. One of the most curious phenomena was the till-
ing up of wells with sand, and the shooting upwards for a height of
several feet of their wooden linings. The after shocks were few in

number.

     Januaiy 18, 1895. At 10.48 p.m. on this date Tokio was again

severely disturbed, and from the feelings of the inhabitants it was difficult
to say whether the movement was more or less severe than that of June.

The fact that many buildings which escaped the latter shock were on this

occasion more or less shattered suggests the idea that the distribution of
movement throughout the city was somewhat different.

      The origin of the disturbance was apparently from 60 to 100 miles to the
north or north-east of Tokio, and from this centre the preliminary tremors
recorded by a seismograph outraced the main shock by 6 or 8 seconds.

Had the writing pointer of tlie seismograph recorded its movements pho-

 tographically, it is likely that this interval would have lieen increasec?.
 It will be of great importance to determine the interval between the
 preliminary tremors and the elastic surface gravitational waves for this

 shock as recorded in Europe.

      Owing to the number of destructive earthquakes which occurred prior
 to the three here mentioned, so many observations have been accumulated
 that up to the present no time has been available for their analysis. The
 observations and notes collected by the writer relating to disturbances
 which have taken place during the last few years, which in themselves
 would have formed a voluminous report, were unfortunately destroyed by

 a tire referred to in the next paragraph.

   --2. Tlie Destruction of Books and Pamphlets rdathig to Seismology. It

 is with regret that I have to announce that on February 17 my house

 and observatory were entirely destroyed by fire. The losses consisted of
 collections of books, instruments, and other things accumulated during the
 last twenty years, the stock of the Transactions of the Seismological
 .Society, which at the time were packed ready for shipment to Europe, and
 about 1,500 books and pamphlets relating to Earthquake and Volcanic
 Phenomena. All that I saved was the clockwork of a new seismograph
 and a bundle of photograms. The analysis of the latter forms the chief

  portion of this report.

    --3. Alterations in tlie Construction of Chimneys. One effect of the

  recent earthquakes in Tokio has been to cause householders to rebuild the
  upper part of their chimneys with thin iron plate, while factory chimney.s
  from 50 to 100 feet in height have for a length of 20 or 30 feet at about
  two-thirds up from their base been strengthened with a series of strong
  iron bands connected vertically by iron straps, it being observed that it

     4. Experiments on the Vibration

--of Chirntieys and BuHd'uujs. Short-

ly after my fire Professors Tanaka-

Jate, Mano, and other Members of

the Earthquake Committee to which

I am attached took diagrams of the

natural vibrations of the brick chim-

ney stack which was left standing

myafter      fire.  The chimney is 18

feet in height, and has a rectangular

section of 3 feet 8 inches by 3 feet

1 inch and two flues. With a rope

and a windlass, a deflection of the

top of the stack of one inch and a

half was obtained, when the rope
was suddenly released The result

was that the chimney vibrated for

about 20 seconds, and a record of

these vibrations was obtained upon

a band of paper. One of the dia-

grams is reproduced, tig. 19. The

period of motion has apparently

varied  with  thfe  range of  swing                           for

When we i-emember that the greatest

portion of the destruction occasioned

by earthquakes is due to the fact

that various portions of a building,

in consequence of not synchronising

in their movements, are mutually

destructive, while solitary structures

may be destroyed in consequence

of the agreement between their

natural period and that of an earth-

quake, it seems likely that observa-

tions like the one now described may

lead to important rules being for-

mulated for builders.

The next experiments will be on

the vibration of wooden buildings.

   --5. The Earth Waves of Earth-

quakes. On several occasions the ap-

paratus described in the Report for

1893 has given diagrams showing the
amount of tilting which accompanies

certain earthquakes. The period of

these angular displacements closely

coincides with the periodicity of hori-

zontal displacement, and its amount has varied l^etween one and three

minutes of arc. The original instrument has unfortunately been destroyed

by fire.

   --6. Work at the Central Observatory under the Directorship of K.

Kohai/ashi, Esq. Athough records from the 9G8 outside oljserving sta-

tions have accumulated at a quicker rate than that at which they can be

tabulated for analysis, many important imiJrovements have been made in

the working of the central station. In one room all instruments intended

for country stations are tested. These instruments are simplified types

of the Gray-Milne seismograph. One test is for the time-recording

clocks, another for the clock driving the recording surface, and a third for

the multiplication of the horizontal and vertical seismographs. Although

several types of spring clocks have been tested, their rates are far from

being satisfactory. Cheap pendulum clocks give good rates, but they are

generally disturbed at the time of an earthquake. In another room an

exceedingly large seismograph, without multiplication, is arranged to

record severe motions. In a third room, which is alive with the ticking

of clocks and chronometers whicli ai'e at stated intervals compared with

time signals fi-om the Astronomical Observatory, there are four seismo-

Agraphs and various

          types of  contact            makers.  glass disc recording sur-

face, on which the pointers for vertical and horizontal motion rest, is

continuously in motion. The recording surfaces of the other instruments

are set in motion by the contact makers, after which time intervals are

marked upon them from a break circuit chronometer. Mr. N. Outska,
who is in charge of this department, finds that for horizontal and vertical

contact makers having equal multiplication the former almost invariably

closes its circuit before the latter.

                                                        Tremors.

     The following note refers to observations and experiments made at a

small observing .station which has recently been established at Shide, in
the Isle of Wight. I reached Shide on July 30, aiid on the following

day a pit was e.vcavated in a dry stable, about 3 ft. G in. in depth, down

to the upper surface of the disintegrated chalk.

    On August 6 and 7 a brick pier, 6 feet in height and 1 ft. G in.

square, was built on a concrete bed to rise freely in the pit. The necessary
wooden covering for this was completed at noon on the 16th, and that

Revening an extremely light horizontal pendulum like was installed and

set to work. This instrument, which I call T, gave a beautifully defined
two-line diagram until the 21st, when the clock ceased to drive the film,

which had become damp and sticky. This was clearly due to moisture

from the drying column being confined in the casing which covered its
upper part and the instrument. To overcome the difficulty I placed
inside the case two trays, each aliout 6 in. by 3 in., of calcium chloride.
Immediately after this tlie pendulum commenced to swing, its range

sometimes reaching ^ incli. This continued until the 25th, when, sus-

pecting that the cause might be due to air currents resulting from rapid

desiccation, I removed the calcium chloride, and the movements ceased.

1 have repeated the experiment several times, with the result tliat when

the calcium chloride is introduced, movements are produced, which in

the developed tilm have the appeai-ance of a violent tremor storm, and
Wewhen it is taken away the diagram is a clear straight line.
                                                                 have

here a cause of air currents which has not yet received serious atten-

tion. Another cause of movement, whicli is easily verified by experi-

ments on a very light pendulum beneath a glass covering, may be due

to the unequal heating of the surrounding walls. If portions of the tremors
which have been recorded are due to causes, such as these which act

within the casings, then it is understood why extremely small and light

pendulums have shown more movement than those which are compara-

tively large and heavy. After my last twenty installations, and those

which preceded them, the horizontal pendulums might be arranged

according to their sensibilities as follows. The most sensitive are those

with booms from one quarter to 3 or 4 inches in length, the next are those

like R, and the one at Shide T, where the boom is of reed or straw about

2 ft. 6 in. in length, following which are booms about 5 feet in length of
bamboo like A, and lastly, as the least sensitive, are the somewhat shorter

and comparatively heavier booms of brass or aluminium used at the

remaining stations. The only exceptions in the last group were the

instruments E and F in the undergi'ound chamber, whicli recorded

ti-emors almost equally as large as A. In this chamber, although there

was but little appreciable daily change in temperature, the ventilation

was good, and therefore there may have been considerable changes in the

hygrometric state of the atmosphere entering the covering cases, which

Awere of wood resting upon a floor of asphalt.  ditference in the rate

at which moisture was absorbed or evaporated from the walls of this

casing might possibly give rise to air currents. The live instruments in

badly ventilated caves may have failed to show tremors, partly on

account of their inertia, and partly perhaps because there was neither

any sensible change in temperature nor in the dryness or wetness of the

atmosphere. That tremors were practically absent from all the instru-

ments on the surface, can only be attributed to their inertia, or to the fact

that they were so well ventilated that no difference in temperature within

their coverings was possible ; but as the huts and casings were similar to

that of R, the most probable explanation is the former.

The most difficult things which require explanation respecting earth

tremors, assuming them to result from air currents due to differences in

temperature or desiccation within the walls that inclose the instruments,

are the facts that tremors have in all cases but one been most pro-

nounced between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., and during the night, and that they

accompany certain meteorological conditions already formulated.

Before attempting tliese explanations it would be advisaT)le to com-

pare the movements of two light pendulums standing on the same column,

one having walls varying in character, and the other, if possible, in

vacuum.

Since tlieir last Report was presented, the Committee have purchased
two bifilar pendulums from the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Com-
pany. Tiiese instruments are similar in most respects to tlie pendulum
with which experiments were made in 1893 (Report, 1893, pp. 291-303),
but several improvements have been introduced in order to correct one or
two defects which those experiments brought to light. The changes made
are described in the Report of 1894 (pp. 145-146, 158-160), and a
'detailed account of the new instrument is given in ' Nature,' vol. 1.,
1894, pp. 246-249. Each pendulum is provided with a photographic
recording apparatus. One of them has been erected on the old foundation

in the cellar of the Secretary's house at Birmingham, l)ut at too recent a
date to allow atiy results to be included in this Report. It was intended
that the second instrument should be placed in a building about three-
quarters of a mile to the east of the fii'st, but it was afterwards found
that the construction of the foundation might endanger the stability of
the walls. Arrangements are accordingly being made for the erection of
this instrument on another site in the neighbourhood of the former, and

it is hoped that a comparison of the records of both may lie completed

before the next meeting of the Association. The second pendulum will
then be available for use elsewhere.

     The Committee recommend that they be reappointed, with the addi-

tion of ]\Ir. G. F. Deacon.

     In every case, I believe, except those numbered 8 and 10, the principle
of the instrument was discovered independently. The horizontal pendu-
lum has also been designed as a time-recorder for small disturbances by
Professor J. Milne (Japan, 'Seismol. Soc. Trans.,' vol. iii., 1881, pp. 61-
62; 'Nature,' vol. xlii., 1890, p. 347); Professor T. C. Mendenhall
(' Amer. Journ. Sci.,' vol. xxxv., 1888, p. 105) ; and Professor G. Grablo-

vitz ('Boll, della Soc. Seismol. Ital.,' vol. i., 1895, pp. 12-17).

     All the different forms of horizontal and bifilar pendulums agree in
one respect : the vertical distance between their points of support is very
great compared with the horizontal distance between them. In principle
they merely differ in the method of suspension ; and, according to this

method, they may be grouped in the following three classes :

     1. The pendulum in which the rod or mirror is suspended by two

wires. These may be again subdivided : (a) The pendulums of Close and

H. Darwin, and practically also of Delaunay, and Lord Kelvin and the
Darwins, in which the centre of gravity of the rod or mirror lies between
the two points of attachment of the suspending wires, {b) The pendulums
of Hengeller, Perrot, and Zollner, in which it lies outside them.

     2. The pendulums of Gerard and Milne, on which the rod is supported
l)y one wire and on one steel point.

     3. The pendulum of von Rebeur-Paschwitz, which is supported on two

.steel points.'

     ' In tliis clas-s should be included Professcr Ewing's horizontal pendulum seis-
mogri-nph, which, though designed for a different purpose, also records slow tilts of the
ground (Enri/cl. Brit. vol. x.^i. p. 628).

The Committee was appointed, as in foi-mer years, for the purpose of

co-operating -with the Scottish Meteorological Society in making Meteoro-

logical Observations on Ben jSTevis.

    The hourly eye observations by night as well as by day have been made

uninterruptedly by Mr. Oraond and his assistants during the year at the

Ben  Nevis    Observatory                                                   and  the  continuous  registrations        and  other

observations have been carried on at the Low Level Observatory at Fort

William with the same fulness of detail as during the previous four years.

    The Directors of the Observatories tender their cordial thanks to

Messrs. C. M. Stewart, B.Sc, A. D. Russell, and C. T. R. Wilson for

valuable assistance rendered as volunteer observers during the summer

months for about six weeks each, thus giving gi-eater relief to the members

of the regular observing staft".

    For tJie year 1S94, Table I. shows the monthly mean and extreme

pressures and temperatures, hours of sunshine, amounts of rainfall, number

of fair days and of days when the amount exceeded one inch, the number

of  hours of  bright  sunshine                                              and       this year for tlie  first  time  the  mean

while those at the top of the Ben are reduced to 32" only.

only three hours of sunsliine. On the other hand, anticyclonic weather

was of frequent occurrence in September, October, and December and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

accordingly in these months sunshine was large, being absolutely the highest

hitherto recorded in September and October, and having been only
exceeded in December. It will be also observed that during these months

the difTerence of temperature between the two Observatories was much less

than usual, owing to the higher temperature of the anticyclones at the
top of the Ben. The highest monthly mean temperature at Fort William
v/as 58°-9 in July, or 2°-2 above the mean ; and at the top 43°-3 in the
same month, or 3°"0 above the mean. The month of greatest excess
above the average was November, whose mean temperature at Fort
William was 46°-7, or 4°-l above the mean, while at the top it was 31°-3
or 3°'2 above the mean. This great excess of temperature was about the
same in all parts of Scotland, and was occasioned by an extraordinary
predominance of south-westerly wind, which exceeded any observed in
November dui-ing the past forty years. The sunshine was markedly
deficient, and hence temperature at the top was relatively lower than
at Fort William. The following show the deviations of the monthly
results from their respective )neans :

    The maximum temperatui-e at the top was G3°-5 on June 30, and
81°-5 at Fort William on July 1. The minimum temperature at the top

was 0°-7 on January G, and at Fort William ·20°-S on January 6.
     The above minimum temperature 0°-7 is absolutely the lowest yet

observed on the top of Ben Nevis. The conditions under which it

occurred are seen in the following extract from the day's observations :

    This low minimum temperature occurred at the same time as the lowest

barometric reading of a small satellite cyclone passing over the British

Islands (see Daily Weather Reports). As the centre of the disturbance

advanced, temperature very rapidly fell, and thereafter rose steadily, but
more slowly than it had fallen, and the easterly winds acquired a little
southing. The wind was high throughout, attaining at 7 A.M. a velocity at
the rate of 43 miles an hour, accompanied by constant fog and showers
of snow. It is this type of weather, a temperature approaching zei'o,
near the point of saturation, and fog drifted onward with very high
wind, which is the most disagreeable and prejudicial to health of all

weather encountered at this high elevation. It may also be noted that

the dip in the temperature was coincident with the dip in the barometric

pressure.

     The registrations of the sunshine recorder on the top show 810 hours
out of a possible 4,470 hours, being 130 hours more than in 1893. This

equals 18 per cent, of the possible sunshine. The maximum was 126

liours in September, which is higher than any previously recorded Sep-

tember ; and the minimum 3 hours in January, being the lowest yet
recorded in this month. At Fort William the number for the year was
1,160 hours, being 95 hours in excess of the previous year. As the
number of hours of possible sunshine at Fort William is, owing to the
surrounding hills, only 3,497 hours, the sunshine of 1894 here was 33 per

cent, of the possible number.

190 REroKT-- 1805.

     The mean hourly velocity of the wind at the top was 16 miles, the
monthly mean maximum being 26 miles in January, and the minimum

10 miles in June. For the five months from May to September the mean

was 11 miles per hour, but for the six months from November to April
the mean was 20 miles per hour. The relations here indicated among the
.seasons .substantially hold good year by year.

     The rainfall for the year at the top was 149-96 inches, being 3'63 inches

above the average. At Fort William the amount was 79'17 inches, which
is 4'07 inches above the average. The maximum monthly rainfall at
the top was 33"5.5 inches in February, and the minimum 1-32 inch in
September. At Fort William the maximum monthly fall was 13-02
inches in February, and the minimum fall 0-24 inch in September.

The above are the smallest monthly amounts yet recorded at either of
the Observatories, and the maxima are higher than any hitherto recorded

for February.

These two months were a strong contrast to each other. In February,

cyclone succeeded cyclone in swift succession to each other accompanied

with heavy and destructive gales, deluges of rain, and heavy snowfalls
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

whereas September was for much the greater part of the month under

the influence of anticyclones, accompanied with clear sky, dry and well-

nigh rainless weather. At the top of the Ben 6-67 inches of rain fell on

February 6, being, except on October 3, 1890, the greatest daily fall on

the records of the Observatory.

At the top the rain fell on 246 days, and at Fort William on 208 days,

being respectively 14 and 30 days under their averages. The maximum

number of days on which rain fell at the top and at Fort William was 27

days in January, and the minimum number 9 days at the top and 5 at

Fort William in September.

During the year the number of days on which an inch of rain was

exceeded was 46 days on Ben Nevis and at Fort William 16 days. In

February the numbers were 11 days and 3 days respectively.

Auroras are reported to have been observed on the following dates :

February 13, 25 ; March 24, 25, 30, 31 ; April 28 ; August 23, 31 ; Sep-

August 15; September 17; lightning only on January 29, February 4, 25.

Almost daily during the last week of February there were strong

earth- currents in the telegraph cable between the base and summit of the

hill.

    At Fort William the mean atmospheric pressure at 32° and sea-level

was 29-845 inches, and at the top 25-291 inches, the difference being thus

4-554 inches, being only very slightly above their averages. At the top

the highest pressure during the year was 25-992 inches in June, and the
lowest 23-742 inches in December, the difference being 2*250 inches, a

rather large difference.

     Mr. A. J. Herbertson has made further progress in carrying on, at
the two Observatories and in the south of France, the research on the
hygrometry of the atmosphere referred to in last report. The work is
now in an advanced stage of preparation, and the results will shortly b<»

    Much work has been done in the offices in Edinburgh and Fort

William in recopying, on separate daily sheets, the hourly observations

of the two Observatories, in connection with a strictly scientific examina-
tion of the two sets of observations in their bearings on the meteorology

of north-western Europe.

     This important research was begun by Dr. Buchan in spring last, and

it has since occupied any time that has been available after the discharge
of his official duties. The subject has been divided into several parts,
and each is treated separately by itself, in its relations with the other
observations more or less closely connected with it. The following are

the selected divisions of the research : Cyc^lones ; anticyclones ; differ-

ences of temperature between the top and bottom of the mountain, much

smaller than the normal difference, including inversions of temperature,

when the temperature at the top is higher than that at Fort William
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

pressure likely to occur with the coming cyclone ; relations of the obser-

readings of the two barometers occur, as regards time of phases, and

all parts of Scotland.

     In these inquiries the weather maps of this and other European

countries at the time are examined. The general method of treatment

may be best shown by an example. Thus in dealing with cyclones, the

following data are collected and entered in the respective columns of the

sheet for cyclones, viz., position in Europe of the cyclone position of the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

It will be recognised that several of these points have been to some

extent already adverted to in our previous reports ; but what is now
attempted to be done is an inquiry into their relations to each other. The

unique character of the inquiry results from the fact that the High Level
Observatory on Ben Nevis is situated right in the general path of the

cyclones of north-western Europe, whereas the other high level observatories

and stations of Europe that have been used in similar investigations are

altogether outside that path. So far as it has gone, the inquiry already

points to the result that there can be no doubt most important modifica-
tions will require to be made as to the theories of the cyclone more gener-

ally held by meteorologists at the present time.
192 REPORT-- 1895.

It being felt that more assistance was required to expedite this

work of discussion than it is in the power of the directors to give,
application was made to the President and Council of the Royal Society

for a grant of 100^. from the fund placed at their disposal by the Goveni-

ment Grant Committee. The application was granted, and the money

will be applied in paying assistants for doing portions of the routine

work of the offices in Edinburgh and Fort William, in order to give

Dr. Buchan and Mr. Omond time for cai-rying on the inquiries sketched

out above.

The examination of the Hourly Barometric Curves during fine, clear

days and during cloudy days respectively, have been continued, on

account of their very high value in connection with the work of the two

Observatoi'ies. To our last report six tables were appended, giving the

hourly values for each month for the top of the mountain for Fort

William, and for Trieste, near the head of the Adriatic, for clear and

cloudy days respectively.

During the year Mr.Omond has continued these most laborious calcula-

tions, so that your Committee are in a position to add four Tables to the

above. The two new stations are Magdeburg, in Germany, selected because

its comparatively dry climate forms an admirable contrast to the rather

wet climates of Fort William and Trieste, and San Jose, situated in lat.

9°-56' N., long. 84°-0 W., and at a height of 3,756 feet above the sea. A.s

its height approximates to that of Ben Nevis, the observations made at

this Observatory, which is situated only ten degrees from the equator,

form an excellent comparison with those made at the top of Ben

Nevis.

Tables V.-VIII. give the departures in thousandths of an inch from the

daily means of the barometer at each hour of the day at Ben Nevis, Fort

William, Trieste, Magdeburg, and San Jose, on fine or sunny days, and

on cloudy or overcast days. In each case, three years have been taken,

though not the same years at each station, the figures being 'bloxamed,'

as in last report. San Jose is chiefly interesting as showing how a tropical

station in a steady climate, where every reading of the barometer during

the three years lay between 26'000 and 26"400 inches, with rain falling

only at certain seasons, and then almost wholly confined to the afternoon

hours, differs from the recoixls of a temperature zone-station with a vari-

able climate.

This is not the place to enter on any adequate discussion of the results,

but it is of importance to point out that the characteristically low morn-

ing maximum, and very high evening maximum during cloudy days at

Ben Nevis, Fort William, Trieste, and Magdeburg, in all seasons, do

not occur at San Jose in similar weather. It is, however, diflferent as

regards the two daily minima at San Jose, the morning minimum being

distinctly larger on cloudy than on sunny days, and the afternoon minimum

less. There are also marked characteristics, in cloudy weather, of the

barometric pressure at Fort William and Trieste, suggesting that in such

weather the temperature of the atmosphere, taken as a whole, falls to n

                                    Magnetic Units.

       To the British Association Committee on Electrical Standards.

Believing that the Committee is impressed with the convenience of

affixing names to some of the more important units connected with the

magnetic circuit, I beg to suggest the following considerations and

recommendations, which I will write out as briefly as possible. The state-

ments  are     intended                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            to  be precise  in  their  terms                          but in several cases
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

alternative forms of definition are given.

     (1) That the unit coetEcient of self-induction, though frequently
useful, is by no means one of the most fundamental units, but should

be defined in a suitably subordinate manner, with reference to other and

more important quantities.

     (2) That it would be a mistake so to define it as to discourage the

employment of the same term for as many other quantities of the same

' dimensions ' as possible ; especially for the unit coefficient of mutual

induction, and for unit 'permeance.'

   H(3) That the essentially different quantities commonly called and B

should be carefully kept distinct, although their measures in air have

been conventionally so arranged as to be numerically equal.

                                      First quantity to he named.

     (4) The iirst thing requiring a name is this quantity magnetic
potential, sometimes called magneto-motive force ; a quantity spoken of and
measured, not inconveniently but with insufficient generality, by electrical

engineers as ampfere-turns. It has been proposed (by Mr. Heaviside, for
instance) that it be called gaussage, and that its c.g.s. unit be one gauss.

     (5) The circuital gaussage round a closed curve is 4- times the total
electric current through the area bounded by that curve.

     In the case of a magnetic circuit wound with wire the gaussage is

1 j- times I ' or 1-2.jGG) the ampere-turns threading that circuit.

--A'ote.    It may  be  best to retain  the  word  ' gaussage                                                                   for the whole  of
                                                                                                                             '

a closed circuit only, and to speak of the ditf'erence of magnetic potential

between two points as the fall of gausses or the ' gauss-fall ' from a to b.

(6) The gaussage, or gauss-fall, in any portion a b oi a magnetic

cii'cuit, is measured by the change in the potential energy of a unit pole as

it moves from a to h by any path which involves neither the cutting of

magnetic layers nor the encircling of currents (a long channel being

imagined for its motion through solid material if necessary). Or, more

practically, it is measui'ed hy the induction througli a long narrow tube

whose ends are at a, and b respectively, divided by the permeance of that

tube. {Cf. Chattock on a magnetic potentiometer, Fliil. Mag., July 1887.)
     In practice, however, gaussage is frequently calculable from the

ampere-turns to which it is due.

     (7) Intensity of magnetic force, or H, will be naturally expi'essed as
gauss-fall per centimetre, or the gauss-gradient. For instance, the earth's

horizontal intensity at some place is ·18 gauss per linear centimetre, or

5'4 gausses per foot.
-- HHole.
            sliould not (strictly speaking) be expressed as so many lines

per square centimetre that mode of expression should be reserved for;

Hinduction-density B.      is the cause, and should be thought of as the slope

Bof magnetic potential, is the effect. In a medium of so-called unit

permeability the two quantities are numerically equal, but they should

not be confounded ; any more than the slope of cleccric potential, or
electric-intensity (e), should be thought of as identical with current-

density, even in a medium of unit conductivity.

     (8) The gauss-gradient inside a long or closed magnetic solenoid of
length /, wound uniformly with n tarns of wire each conveying the current
C|, is 4 7rnC| ;7=:47r;i,C| ; where w, is the total number of turns of

wire (in all the layers) to the linear centimetre.

   HThis is the measure of in the interior of such a solenoid, quite irre-

specti\e of the material with which it may happen to be filled.

{8a) That the rotation of the plane of polarisation caused by any

transparent body is equal to the number of gausses between the points

where the ray enters and leaves the body, multiplied by the appropriate

specific constant of its material (sometimes called Verdet's constant) ; in

other words, that Verdet's constant may be expressed in degrees or radians

per gauss.

                        Second quantity to be named.

     (9) The second quantity requiring a name is the total inductio7i in a

magnetic circuit, also called 'total flux,' 'total lines,' ' electro-magnetic
momentum,' and ' electrotonic state.' It is the quantity whose time-rate

of variation gives the voltage induced in an electric circuit surrounding it
once. It is proposed that its practical unit be called a ' weber/ and be

defined as equal to 10"^ c.g.s. lines (or unit tubes) of induction.

                       N= - |Ef7<= \'RCdt=nq,.

     (10) The total induction through any area may be practically measured

by suddenly surrounding it with a closed wire circuit of ii turns connect-

ing the terminals of a ballistic galvanometei-, and measuring the quantity

of electricity thereby impelled through the galvanometer. The induction

Hhis equal to the quantity so impelled, multiplied by                           the resistance of

the circuit. If the quantity is one coulomb, and the resistance one ohm,

the induction is l/';(th of a weber.

     Or, otherwise, if the induction through any boundary changes at

EMFthe rate of one weber per second, the     excited in that boundary is

1 volt.

     In the case of a spiral wire circuit through wliich induction is varying at
the rate of a weber per second, one volt is excited in each turn of the wire.

     (11) Another tx\oAq of measuring the total induction through an area
is to surround that area with a movable electric circuit of n turns of wire

conveying a known curi'ent, and to measure the potential (or mechanical)
energy of the circuit under those conditions. The induction is equal to

the potential energy of the circuit divided by ')i times the current circu-

lating in each turn of wire.
     Or, if the induction through a simple circuit carrying one ampere is

one weber, the potential energy of the circuit is one joule.

                            Derived quantities.

    (12) Induction- density, or B, may be expressed as so many webersper

unit area ; say per square centimetre or per square inch, or whatever is

preferred for practical purjioses.

     For instance, the earth's horizontal induction-density at some place is

=·18 c.g.s. unit, -18 x 10~** weber per square centimetre. =18 micro webers

per square metre.

     (13) The inductivity (fi), or absolute permeability of a medium at any
HBpoint under specified circumstances, is the ratio of to
                                                                                   at that point,

and under those circumstances. In many substances this ratio is far from

constant. [It may be expressed in terms of henry s or other units of per-

meance per unit length (see below), instead of in c.g.s. units, if convenient.

For example, the inductivity of air is T-ffu^h of a microhenry per centimetre
)

200 iiKPORT-- 1895.

or one millihenry per kilometre.] More explicitly it is measured by the
webers per unit area divided by the gauss-fall per unit length ; in other
words, by the ratio of the weber-density to the gauss-gradient.

     (14) The relative inductivity of a substance as compared with that of

empty space (/'//Uo) TM^y be called simply its 'permeability' as at present,

and is a mere number.

     (Its electrical analogue is specific inductive capacity (k/k,,), as contrasted
with absolute electric inductivity (k) ; which latter could be defined in
practical units as the ratio of the coulombs displaced per unit area to the

volt-gradient.

   Third quantity to he nained.

     The third quantity for whose unit a name is required is some form of
ratio between the two fundamental quantities whose units are here named
after Weber and Gauss respectively. It has been practically decided in
America that this unit shall be named after Prof. Henry, of Washington,
and that it shall equal 10^ c.g.s. units, being equivalent to the earth-
quadrant or secohm ; but the precise mode of definition has not yet been

finally agreed upon.

     There are two quantities of the same physical dimensions to which the
name is applicable, viz., the coefficient of self or mutual induction of a
coil or coils of wire, and the permeance or inverse reluctance of a magnetic

circuit.

     The most logical order is to define permeance first, as the ratio of the

inductance of a coil of n turns of wii-e is 7i^ or 'Ittw^ or 'AiTxri^ times the

units of gaussage and current which have been decided on.

is the numerical factor connecting inductance with permeance.

     The apparent simplicity of this last system has much to recommend it

for commercial use, though it will complicate the specification not only of
permeance but also of magnetic fields and potentials ; but some incon-
venience due to the unfortunate definition of the unit pole, and the only
less unfortunate definition of the practical unit of current, cannot be
avoided ; and our aim must be to place the inconvenience where least
likely to be felt in every-day work.

                                                        First system.

   We will begin with the more logical system, and with general statements

which apply to both.
      (15) In a complete magnetic circuit the ratio of the total induction

to the corresponding gaussage under specified conditions is called the
 'permeance' of that circuit under those conditions. It is not in general

constant.

      Or, the permeance of any solenoidal portion of a magnetic circuit, if

free from intrinsic magneto-motive force or magnetic boundary layers, is
the webers through it divided by the gausses between its ends.

     (16) The practical unit of permeance is that of a circuit in whicli a
weber is excited by a gauss. Its reciprocal is the unit of reluctance. The

practical unit so defined is 10** c.g.s. units.

  --Examples. Tlie permeance of a cubic metre of air to parallel induction

from one face to the opposite is 1 microweber per gauss.

     Under circumstances sucli that the permeability of iron is 400 times
that of air, the permeance of an iron ring of one decimetre cross section

= =and one metre in mean diameter is -^-I- =20r 100 c.g.s. again one

microweber per gauss.
     It is, perhaps, a question whether this amount of permeance could be

called ' a microhenry ' without confusion.

  --ExpJmiation. The inductance (or self-induction-coeilicient) of an

electric circuit consisting of n turns of wire, so far as it is constant, is
defined to be equal to n times the induction produced through it by a
current of one ampere in each turn. But the gaussage due to n ampere-

turns is ^^''^ or -47^1 ; hence the inductance of a wire coil is ·4^r?^- times

the webers caused by each gauss in the magnetic circuit surrounded by it

i.e., is ·inn''- times the permeance of that circuit considered as constant.

   A(17) coil of wire threading n times a complete magnetic circuit of

unit permeance under any given circumstances is said to have --iTTn- units

of inductance under those circumstances ; and in general the inductance

of a coil of n turns is ^izn^- times the permeance (as above defined) of the
magnetic solenoid enclosed by it. (The permeance may here be considered

variable.

     ["With the ampere-turn as unit gaussage the ^tt is prefixed similarly to
both inductance and permeance, so that only the factor n- is needed to

convert one into the other. See below.]

(18) The c.g.s. unit of inductance is equal to « times the induction excited

through a coil per c.g.s. unit of current in every turn of wire ; whereas the

practical  unit  of  inductance is  n  times the webers  excited per  ampere
                                                                                                      ;

hence the practical unit of inductance is 10^ times the c.g.s. unit.

The practical unit is called a 'henry.' (It has also been called

secohm and quadrant.)
    Exatnjjle.--lf the above iron ring were wound closely with 1000 turns

of wire, the coil would have a coefficient of self-induction equal to - or

1^ henry s whenever the permeability of the iron was 400.

   A coil of 20,000 turns of wire, wound closely on the same core, would

have an inductance of 1[ Iienrys if it contained air or other non-magnetic

substance.

           Alternative mode of definition of inductance on first system.

     In view of one of the above practical methods of measuring induction

experimentally, the inductance of coils of wire, both self and mutual, may

be defined more directly thus :

    (19) When of two simple circuits one conveys a current, the other

in general has induction caused through it ; and the ratio of the induction
2U2                          --JiEl'OKT 18U-J.

through eitliei' to the inducing current in the other is called the mutual

inductance of the circuits.

     (20) Of two coils, with ii and ?t' turns respectively, the total mutual
inductance is to be reckoned for every turn of wire on each coil, and is

therefore nn times the inductance of the mean turn of one coil on the

inean turn of the other.

     (21) The mutual inductance of two coils is i:nn7i' times the permeance
of the largest magnetic solenoid which threads both. For if every turn
of one conveys a current C, while every turn of the other surrounds an

induction N' in consequence, the permeance of the magnetic solenoid

=Pthreading the second coil is  N'/-i7i'?iC ; but the total effective mutual

induction, MO, through all the turns is w'N' ; hence M=47r7i?i'P.

    (22) When two coils each conveying one ampere are constantly con-

nected by one henry of mutual inductance, the kinetic energy of the field

due to their mutual action is one joule.

      (23) If the st'//'-induction coefficient of a coil is being considered, its

total inductance may be taken as 7i- times the inductance of the mean
turn ; that is n times the total induction through it divided by the in-
ducing current. Or the weber-turns per ampere give the self-inductance

in henrys.

     (23a) The expression weber-turns, to signify the i^roduct of the total

field into the number of spires surrounding it, though at first sight not in

precise correspondence with the phrase ampfere-turns where the current

cii'culates in the spiral instead of forming its core, is really accordant

with it, because a spiral and its core are geometrically interchangeable.
     (24) The practical unit of inductance, whether self or mutual, is called

a henry ; and a coil of n turns has a henry of inductance, on itself or on
another of w' turns, when an ampere in one maintains 1/w' weber of

induction (through itself or) through the other.

     (25) When the induction through a coil varies for any reason at the

rate of one weber per second, the E.M.F generated in each turn is one volt.

     (26) When the inductance of a soil is one henry, on itself or on another,

a small variation of current in it at the rate of one ampere per second

EMFinduces an  of one volt in itself or in the other.

     (27) When the inductance of a coil conveying one ampere varies at

the rate of a heiiry j^er second, the induced E.M.F is one volt.

     (28) When the self-inductance of a coil is constantly, or on the

average, one henry, while an ampere current is genei'ated in it, the

kinetic energy of the field due to that ampere is half a joule.

                               Second si/stem.

     (29) If instead of taking a gauss as equal to a c.g.s. unit of magnetic
Hpotential, we take the circulation of
                                          caused by one ampere-turn as

the practical unit of magneto-motive force, we shall have 1 ampere-turn

= -- cg.s. units of gaussage.

     (30) The practical unit of permeance will then be that in which a
weber of total induction is excited by each amp)ere-turn ; in other words,
it will be Att x 10^ c.g.s. units of permeance.

    (31) And the practical unit of inductance will be that of a coil in

"which an ampere in every turn excites -th of a weber through every

                                                                                                                       11

turn ; that is to say, tlie inductance of a coil will be n- times the permeance
of the magnetic circuit surrounded by it.

     (32) The difference between inductance and permeance is only one
of reckoning. Permeance is webers per ainp^re-turn. Inductance is

weber-turns per ampere.

Summary of the Advantages of this Mode of defining

                              Unit Inductance.

The special feature of this mode of defining the ' henry ' is that it makes

inductance depend on the simple ratio N/C, or weber-turns per ampere,

instead of on something more complicated.

     It might possibly be defined as the ratio clN /dC, that is, as pro-

HBportional to the tangent of the slope of the : curve ; and such a defini-

tion would emphasise its variability ; but certain practical advantages
would be lacking, because it would be detached from any connexion with

the 2iernieance of the circuit. The N/C ratio on the other hand instantly

connects itself with permeance, and represents the slope of the secant

HBdrawn from the origin to any point of the : curve. It exhibits the

variability sufficiently ; making the inductance reach a maximum at the

shoulder of the curve, and then slowly decrease as saturation sets in.

  --It is sometimes said but the mode of expression is, to say the least,

--very inconvenient that there are three different principles on which to

define L, all leading to a different result : viz., numbering them inversely,

but giving them in their usual order :

           W=l(3) Energy . . .                   LC^

           =(2) E.M.F . . E. L dC/dt

But the real facts to be expressed are not here exhibited.  The real

facts are                      ^^^ ]Sr=LC
                               (2) E=^dN/dt

                               {?>) dW^Cdi^

NThe essential thing to name is therefore        ; and if 10^ c.g.s. lines or

unit tubes be called a ' weber,' or a ' weber-turn,' then a volt is a weber

or a weber-turn per second, and a joule is a weber-ampere-turn.

Nothiiig can be handier than that ; and a henry can be defined as a

weber-turn per ampere.

Instead of saying as above that there are three ways of defining L, the

simplest thing is to say that two of the thi'ee equations as first given above

are incorrect, except for the special and in j^ractice comparatively rare case

when L is constant. Written out correctly they stand as follows :

                        (1) N=LC

                        ^(2)'  E=L'^^ -hC'^^

                                          dt dt

                        W=^(3) LC^-fiC'c^c/L

     It is then obvious that (2) and (3) are too complicated to base a
definition upon, and that the first alone gives a feasible system.

    The fact that L is decidedly not in general constant deprives the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 --

henry of any such importance as the ohm possesses ; moi-eover, it refers

expHcitly to rather a special thing, viz., a coil of wire, and that under
specified conditions, if it contain iron ; hence it would be rather absurd to

name this alone of all magnetic units. In the above communication, in
addition to a certain mode of defining the henry, it is u)-ged that unit
total induction be named too \ for this is the quantity which is of real

--engineering importance this is the quantity to attain which field-magnets

are built, and in the midst of which armatures are spun.
     It is also urged that it would be convenient if unit magnetic potential

could likewise be named, since electrical engineers have shown that they
have need of some such unit for the exciting cause of induction, by their
practical employment of the phrase ' ampere-turns.' The introduction of
a gauss unit, in some form not too obviously limited to the case of a wire-
wound coil, would assist teaching and would clarify magnetic ideas.

     The present writer does not presume to decide between the two

alternative systems of defining 'the gauss' as given above : viz., the
c.g.s. unit on the one hand, and the ampere-turn on the other.

be defined as dN /dC ; with permeability as ^/=f^B/f?H to correspond.

A letter just received from Mr. Heaviside indicates that lie would pro-

bably favour this course, and there is evidently much to be said for it.

I need hardly add that he contemns my temporising method of dealing

with the 4- nuisance.
      It need hardly be said that in the last resort it rests with practical

men to employ or decline any suggested system of units. Those who daily

deal with the quantities under consideration are the best judges of the
utility or otherwise of a suggested unit, provided always that they take

the trouble to give it a fair trial, and see how it works in practice. It
may be hoped that the above or similar suggestions will meet with criti-
cism at the hands of such men, and in order to make a beginning of

criticism I asked the Departmental Lecturer on Electrotechnics at Uni-
versity College, Liverpool (Mr. F. G. Baily), to consider them with special

reference to

(1)  The large size of the weber and henry units
                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

(2)  the handiest definition of the gauss   and

                                           ;

(3) the least troublesome mode of bringing in the 47r.

     His reply, which is annexed, covers these points, and also incidentally

refers to the quantity called I or intensity of magnetisation.

     Now, as must often have been pointed out, the equation B:=H-F47rI is

a barbarous one, involving as it does quantities of diflTerent dimensions in

--one equation. Its true meaning is of course B:=/xoH+ (^t jko)H ; which,

although algebraically only a roundabout method of writing B=:^/H, is yet

convenient, as exhibiting separately the part of the induction due to the

ether and the part due to a material medium.

   --The customary convention of further denoting (//. /'n)//"o by the

symbol 4t,,-, and then christening kH as the magnetisation I, is likewise

convenient. With this definition k is a pure number, and I is a gauss-

gradient or field-intensity. Another, but on the whole less satisfactory,

definition, viz., the omission of /(,, from the denominator, would make k of the

same dimension as ^/, and I an induction-density.

   A ^ABHThe pull between two parallel magnetised surfaces of area is

-?-4n-, that is to say, NH/8-, and is therefore measured in webers multiplied

by the gauss-gradient, or in joules per centimetre. But to maintain an

induction density B in air requires a gauss-gradient B//in, hence we might

write the pull across an air-gap as N--^-S-//oA. If the induction-density

across an air-gap is expressed in microwebers per square centimetre the

tension there comes out in units of which 2,500 would make an atmo-

sphere ; or, roughl}', in pounds per square foot.

    As for the strength of a magnetic pole-- a quantity which, though

--fundamental in one sense, is seldom really dealt with it will naturally be

expressed in ergs per gauss, or in joules per gauss if it is very strong.

Mr. Baily's chief practical suggestions are first that a special unit of

permeance, other than the henry, is desirable; and next that the 47r/'10

had best be thrown on to the /<, so as to keep the gauss equal to one

ampere-turn. The fact that the inductivity of air will then cease to appear

in its artificial garb of unity may even be regarded as a positive advantage,

because its existence will then be less likely to be ignored. But I
much^ fear that the ampere-turn as unit of gaussage, so near the c.g.s.
unit in size and yet not equal to it, will be awkward and may lead to

mistakes.                                                                                                                                                                            O. J. L.

    Dear Professor Lodge,-- In reference to the sizes of the magnetic units

proposed by you, I find that the weber 10« c.g.s. would only be used in
fractions. The largest dynamo that I know of has a magnetic flux, or, as

you propose to call it, an induction, of -5 weber. From this the value will
go down to about -01 in small motors. These figures are, however, by no
means inconvenient.

     Transformers will be rather smaller. In these the weber-turn is a con-

venient size and an interesting quantity, as it is given by \ of the mean volts
per cycle, or, more accurately expressed, mean volts per unit frequency -^'^.

Its numerical value will lie between, say, \ and 50, according to the volts
and the frequency ; but it gives no indication of the size of the transformer.

   mThe henry, 10^ c.g.s., is also large. The inductance of choking coils

would general be fractions of a henry. The inductance of the winding
of a transformer has no very important meaning, but it has a conve*^

nient size._ Measuring it as mean volts per tmit frequency -four times

the open circuit current in amperes, the inductance of the primary coil
on a 2 IP closed magnetic circuit 1,000-volt transformer would be about
40 henrys.

The inductance of pairs of cables would run from 100 to 1,000 micro-
henrys per kilometre, but the value would vary with the arrangement.
The induction per unit area is good
                                                                                                                                                                  ;  having a value  in practical work

from 1,000 to 20,000 c.g.s. units, it is given by 10 to 200 microwebers

per sq. cm.
206 REPORT-- 1895.

      Gaussage would be about 50 in small transformers, up to 40,000 in
large dynamos. The latter could be conveniently reckoned in kilogausses.

=To make the gauss 1 ampere-turn appears to have great advantages in

practice, and connects it directly with its usual source.

     The idea of permeance is very useful, and the identification of its
dimensions with those of inductance is neat. But I think it is liable to
cause confusion, for the permeance of the core of a coil will be a different
number of henrys from the inductance of its wire. Moreover, the argu-
ment as to identical dimensions might equally be applied to the case of
amperes and gausses. I would therefore have a new unit strictly connected

with the henry, so that inductance =:;'»'- x permeance in a coil of n turns.
    As to the units of permeance : with the above meanings of gauss and

weber the permeance of a circuit Avould be 47r^A/10/', as you point out,
instead of fiA/l. But I wish to suggest a change in the method of

reckoning, namely, still to retain the value of the permeance as J^_®^^

ability of space and air:='012566 micro-unit of permeance for a unit cube,
and permeability of soft iron=up to 25 mici-o-units for a imit cube. Thus we

have permeance =A/(//, where /i is to be obtained from tables of its value,

which can easily be altered to this method. Inductance then becomes

weber-turns     or     ,  webers ,                                                permeance.

It may be objected that the c.g.s. units of strength of field, unit mag-

netic pole and intensity of magnetisation do not bear any simple relation

to these practical 'units. This is chiefly important in the use of the mag-

neto-metric measurement of iron, and in the measurement of the mechanical

form of attraction between two magnetic surfaces in contact. But the

expressions are not in reality much complicated ; .(/., present c.g.s. unit

of intensity of magnetisation is given by 4-1=: (/it-- /j^) H, where f.i^-=Tper-

=meability of space 1, and H^c.g.s. unit of magnetic force. This becomes

   --As the single magnetic pole is unchanged, the force on it will be strength

occurrence, except in magnetic surveys, the complication will not be serious.

Other magnetic relationships are almost entirely of academic interest only,

and would be carried out in c.g.s. units. Also the transition would pre-

sent no difficulties to people with a little scientific knowledge.

I am of opinion also that as the legal volt has no direct connection with

induction and velocity of motion, it is not necessary to define the practical

units as they are defined absolutely. That is, ohm and ampere are the start-

ing points, volt is obtained from them, weber from volt, gauss from ampere,

permeance unit from weber and gauss, henry from weber and ampere or

from permeance, and so on. This is much more easily explained to practical
and imscientitic men than the absolute derivations are, and it is the order

in which they learn them.

Remarks on the Above (especially on pages 203 and 204).

   According to the proposal of the Chicago Chamber of Delegates, the
quantity which we call ' inductance,' and Avhich is to be expressed in
' henrys,' is defined by the equation

E=L ,                            for self-induction,

                               ,

                           at

              E=M --dG
                                                  , for mutual induction,

Ecalculated by dividing                    dG                                 This

MLimplies that or is not to be defined as , but as                         .

    I think names are de.sirable both for ^ and""'"'^ f^°o^r" ^-^. I would suggest
                                                       c 7rc

that the former be called ' the total inductance,' and the latter ' the dif-
ferential inductance.' The distinction would be somewliat analogous to
the distinction between the ' mean specific heat from 0° to t° ' and the ' true
specific heat at t°.' Both total and differential inductance should be ex-
pressed in ' henrys,' for they are quantities of the same kind, and when
there is no iron, &c., in the field they are equal.

     I think that the above mode of definition, involving as it does no
magnitude except current and time, is more readily comprehended than
Dr. Lodge's proposed definition, in which the magnitudes involved are
current, ilux of induction, and the number of convolutions of the coil
through which the flux passes. In the definition proposed by the Chicago
delesfates the consideration of the number of convolutions does not

 enter.

     For a circuit or two circuits not having iron, &c., in the field we may

Edefine inductance (in henrys) as the M.F. (in volts) due to variation of
current at unit rate (one ampere per second). When the field is modified

 by the presence of magnetic material the above will be the definition of

 ' differential inductance.'

      The ' total inductance ' for any specified strength of current will be
 the mean A'alue of differential inductance for equal increments of current
 from zero up to the specified strength.

      I would suggest similar nomenclature in the case of permeability :

^ ^- should be called differential permeability, and total permeability.

      In some respects ' mean ' or ' average ' would be a more correct designa-
 tion than ' total ; but these words would be liable to be misunderstood as

                                                                                        '

 referring to an average taken over the different parts of the body or cir-

 cuit. ' Total ' is to be understood as standing for ' calculated on totals.'
208 REPORT-- 1895.

As regards the magnitude of the unit of inductance. While I agree with

Mr. Heaviside and Dr. Lodge that the unit pole ought to have been so

defined that the mutual force between two poles is equal to their product

divided by the surface of a sphere whose radius is their distance, a defini-

Htion which would have made the line-integral of due to a current C

equal to C itself instead of to 477C, I deprecate a mixing up of the two

systems. So long as we employ our present unit of intensity of mag-

netic field, which results from our present definition of the unit pole, we

cannot consistently reckon the line integral as equal to the ampere-turns.

NIt must be reckoned as iir times the ampere-turns, and the flux must

be reckoned as 4-/t times the ampere-turns. The practical inconvenience

of retaining the factor in- cannot be considerable, for it is as easy to tabu-

late the values of 47r/i as the values of fx.

Next as regards ' permeance.' I do not think it can conveniently be

I'eckoned in henrys. I would rather reckon it in ' webers per ampere-

turn,' which would     be  written ' web.  per   amptu ;                               and  there  can  be  no
                                                                                    '

possible doubt as to the meaning intended when once we have fixed the

magnitude of the 'weber.' There seems to be no diflerence of opinion a

Eto what this magnitude should be. It is fixed by the relation =-~j-,

E Nbeing in volts,         in webers, and t in seconds. This is in accordance

with Dr. Lodge's proposal ; but Dr. Lodge has not explicitly recommended

any name for the physical quantity which is measured in webers. Shall

we call it ' weberage ' ?     It  greatly needs  a  name                               for  ' induction ' may
                                                                                   ;

mean B instead of the surface integral of B, besides having many other

meanings.

    When permeance varies according to the strength of current, I would dis-

tin°guish between  'total  ^permeance'    ^ and 'differential permeance'                                ^ ^,-

                                        nC                                                              ndC

As regards ' gaussage ' and ' gauss f al I think the names will be

convenient in the senses proposed by Dr. Lodge, but I cannot agree with
his selection of a unit of measurement. The present definition of the

unit pole (on which the present unit current is based) requires us to

equate the line-integral in question to 47r7iC.

     To be consistent we must reckon gaussage as equal to iir times the

number of amptus. Dr. Lodge's proposal is to reckon C, not in amperes
but in c.g.s. units, thus introducing, as it appears to me, an awkward

breach of continuity.                                                                  j j^ Everett.

     Professor Carey Foster has written objecting to the term ' gauss-
gradient,' instead of ' magnetic gradient ; he prefers the latter, just as he

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  '

would prefer 'temperature-gradient' to 'degree-gradient.'

Dr. Johnstone Stoney has also written, urging strongly that not the

c.g.s. unit of magnetic potential, but one-tenth of this quantity, should

receive  a  name,  in  order  to  make  it harmonise with                              the ampere series
                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

and further recommending that the names ' weber ' and ' gauss,' as above

suggested, should be interchanged.

       § 1. The hourly measurement of the Kew magnetic curves on five

quiet ' clays a month, selected annually by the Astronomer Royal, has

·^een in operation since the beginning of 1890. Tables of the mean

"curly values for each month of the declination, inclination, horizontal

and vertical forces, based exclusively on these quiet days, have been

published annually in the ' Report ' of the Kew Committee to the Royal

Society. Tables have also been given of the mean diurnal variations of

the several elements for the six winter months, the six summer months,

and the whole year.

       With the consent of the Kew Committee I now propose to give a

general resume of the results deducible fi'om the declination and hori-

zontal force records on the selected quiet days of the five years 1890-94.

       For some reasons it would have been desirable to allow a larger

number of years' records to accumulate before entering on a general

discussion                                        to  have  included, for instance, the  complete  cycle  of  ten  or
                                               ;

eleven years believed to occur in magnetic phenomena would have

possessed obvious advantages. On the other hand twenty-five quiet

days for each month of the year seem a sufficient number for a com-

parison of the different months. Further, the frequent occurrence of

certain phenomena, depending apparently on the limitation of the inquiry

to ' quiet ' days, which cause an appreciable amount of indeterminateness

in the results, has led me to think an early survey of the situation

desirable.

       § 2. The first thing to consider is the distribution of the selected

' quiet days.                                         The aim of the Astronomer Royal, he informs me, has been
                                  '

to ensure, first, that the five days selected each month are good specimens

of  '  quiet                          days               and,  secondly,  that their mean comes near the middle    of
                                   '

the month. That the second object has been very satisfactorily accom-
plished, so far as a five years' survey is concerned, will be seen from the
following table. The figures it contains are the intervals, in days, from
the beginning of the month to noon of its mean 'quiet' day, the 300
' quiet ' days being grouped under the months to which they belong.

 twelve sets, each of twenty-five days, had been selected at random, the
 mean diurnal variation got out from either set of 150 days would in all

 probability have appeared almost truly cyclic, and the mean diurnal

 vai'iations got out from the twelve sets of twenty-five days might have

been expected, if not truly cyclic, to show about equally many increments

 and decrements of the element considered in the twenty-four hours.

How far the actual result difiers from this ideal is shown by the

 following table.

     The ' total increment ' means the algebraic sum of excesses of the

values of the element considered at the second midnights of the twenty-

five quiet days in a month over the values at the first midnights ; in
other woi'ds, it equals twenty- five times the mean increment during a
'quiet ' day in the month specified. The five years supply of course five
Januarys, ifcc, or sixty individual months in all.

                                                Table II.

     According to Table II. if every day behaved like a ' quiet ' day there
would be an annual increase of 35' in westerly declination, instead of the
actually existing decrease of 7', and an increase of 1205x10"'' C.G.S.
units in H.F., instead of the actually observed 20 x 10"''.

     Taking the figures as they stand, the evidence in favour of a general
tendency to a non-cyclic variation in the direction of increasing westerly
declination during ' quiet ' days is perhaps not conclusi^'e. Of the indivi-
dual months' records twenty-four show a decrease, and the balance the other

way might be pure chance. The figures relating to the horizontal force,

however, unless ascribable to error, prove conclusively that during the five
years in question the force increased at a wholly abnormal rate on ' quiet
days. It is difiicult to imagine any cause of error -.vorking so uniformly
throughout the year. Supposing uncomj^ensated temperature effect to

exist, for instance, the phenomenon should tend one way during one
season, the opposite during another. The interval between succepsive

' quiet ' days varied arbitrarily, so that the positions of the two midnights
of a ' quiet ' day on the photographic sheets were constantly being inter-

changed. It may also be added that the phenomenon is not peculiar to
Kew, but may be seen in the published Greenwich and Falmouth results

for the same epoch.
     § 5. The phenomena seem not unlikely to be only another phase of

phenomena observed many years ago by General Sabine and Dr. Lloyd.

The former from a careful study of what he termed ' disturbances ' con-
cluded that the aggregates of easterly and westerly declination disturbances

at Kew during 1858-62 nearly balanced, 'there being in some years a

slight preponderance of westerly, and in other years of easterly deflection ; '
at the same time he found ^ ' a slight preponderance of easterly values on

the average of the four years (1858-61).' As regards the horizontal force

he deduced^ from 5,932 disturbed observations at Kew during 1858-64

that ' the ratio of the value of the disturbances decreasing the (horizontal)

force to those which increased it was nearly as 3'23 to 1.' In agreement
with this last result Dr. Lloyd found ^ from an examination of the 335 (?)
most disturbed days at Dublin during the ten years 1841-50 that 'the
mean efiect of disturbances is to diminish that (the horizontal) force.'

     The significance of these results, when taken along with the tendency
suggested by Table II. to a slight abnormal increase of westerly declina-
tion on quiet days, and the clear evidence of an abnormal increase of
horizontal force on these days, need not be dwelt on. Although the
vertical foi'ce lies outside our present inquiry, it may not be amiss to

mention that evidence of a connection of ths kind foreshadowed above is

Kewalso supplied by it. The results, in fact, from the last five years at

show a distinct abnormal decrease of vertical force on ' quiet ' days, while
General Sabine observed a very decided preponderance of disturbances to
be associated with increasing vertical force.

     Whether the species of opposition in the phenomena exhibited by the
horizontal and vertical forces is to be associated with the fact that at pre-
sent the former element is increasing the latter decreasing seems an inter-

esting speculation, but it lies outside our present inquiry.

                Method of Treating the Non-cyclic Diurnal Element.

     § 6. General Sabine got out tables according to which ' disturbances '

at Kew were by no means uniformly distributed over the twenty-four hours

further he found that disturbances associated with easterly deflections

had diflferent hours for maxima and minima from disturbances associated
with westerly deflections, and a like difference appeared between disturb-
ances associated with increasing and those associated with decreasing
horizontal force. If this be so, and if the non-cyclic phenomena observed
on ' quiet ' days be in any way complementary to the disturbed phenomena,

then there is certainly ground for suspecting that the abnormal increase,
say, of H.F. observed in the mean ' quiet' day of a certain month is not
uniformly distributed over the twenty- four hours. While fully recognising
the uncertainty of the hypothesis of uniform distribution of the non-cyclic

element, I have unhesitatingly adopted it provisionally. What General

 Sabine termed ' disturbed ' observations included only some 10 per cent.
 of the entire number ; so that, even supposing the years to which his
 results and the present results applied had been the same, it would hardly
 have been possible to utilise his results in framing a better hypothesis.
Some light might have been thrown on the subject by taking measure-
ments at each hour of every day immediately preceding or succeeding a
'quiet' day, and examining the magnitude of the non-cyclic element for
each combination of twenty-four consecutive hours. The fact that this
would have entailed some 12,000 additional measurements put it out of
court so far as the present inquiry was concerned.

      I have thus decided to regard the variation of an element throughout
the typical ' quiet ' day of a given month as composed of first a non-cyclic

part, consisting in a uniform increase or decrease throughout the twenty-

four hours, second a truly cyclic part spoken of as the diurnal inequality.
     Thus suppose an increment 24 I to occur during the twenty -four hours

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

then the diurnal inequality is what remains of the observed hourly departures

from the mean for the day after the --correction (12 ^)1 has been applied,

t denoting the number of hours elapsed .since midnight. This correction

raises the values throughout one half of the day and depresses them
throughout the other. It of course leaves unchanged the mean value

{K[0] + [24]) + [l]+ .. . +[23j}/24,

and after its application

                           [0]=[24].

The size of the correction applied to each month's results for declination
and horizontal force is obvious from Table II., so that the uncorrected
values can easily be reproduced from the corrected ones recorded pre-

sently.

                Tables of Diurnal Inequality and their Discussion.

     § 7. The following tables. III. and IV., give the diurnal inequality
in the several months and quarters of the year, as well as for winter,
summer, and the entire year. The values given under each month are
the arithmetic means from the data of the five years. The numerically
largest maxima and minima ai-e distinguished by heavy type. The hours
are numbered continuously from midnight, so that 13 and higher numbers
refer to the afternoon. The results for hour 24, being the same as for
hour 0, are omitted.

   A graphical illustration of the diurnal inequality for the year ; for

winter, for summer, for midwinter (December and January), and for
midsummer (June and July), is afforded in Plate V. by the curves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
for the declination, and by the curves 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 for the horizontal force.
The curves will facilitate the comprehension of the principal phenomena.

A comparison of the declination table and curves with the corresponding

results at Kew during the epoch 1858-62, as given by General Sabine in

the 'Phil. Trans.' for 1863, will be found of interest.
     § 8. In both tables the results proceed one figure further than the

actual measurements, the extra figure ai'ising in the process of taking the

means. No smoothing process has been applied to the original data, and

no correction other than the elimination of the non-cyclic element. That
the results are trustworthy, as measurements of magnetic variation, to

months a few hours before niidnight. To attain certainty iu such a case
one would require a very lai'ge number of observations for each month in

the year. When the results of several months are grouped together,

secondary maxima, unless occurring very nearly at the same hour in each
month, are apt to disappear. The smoothness of the mean curve for a
year or a half-year is doubtless in part due to the elimination of observa-
tional errors by means of the large number of observations included ; but

in some cases at least it arises from what may be termed the suicide of
secondary phenomena. Mutual extermination of very delicate phenomena
may even arise when so short a period as a month is dealt with as a

 unit.

      If, instead of the inequality of declination, the inequality of the
disturbing force perpendicular to the magnetic mei'idian be desired, then

the results of Table III. may be converted into C.G.S. measure of force-

at the rate of V to 53 x 10-« C.G.S. units.

      In the horizontal force inequality the most conspicuous feature is

the minimum occurring from 10 to 11 A.M. In every month there is

-- --an unmistakable maximum especially conspicuous in summer about

.7 P.M.

     In winter there is distinct evidence of a second minimum and maximum
during the night and early morning, the maximum being usually the largest
in the twenty-four hours. In summer the evidence in favour of a second
maximum and minimum appears somewhat uncertain. The i-esults are in

general accord with the conclusions for Dublin on p. 184 of Dr. Lloyd's

' Treatise.'

     Supposing hourly values of the element known, one has twenty-three-
constants at one's disposal ; but here I have contented myself with deter-
mining the coefficients of the terms whose periods are respectively 24, 12,,
8, and 6 hours. The subsequent terms appear in reality to be very small,
and any numerical results one might reach in connection with them
would be of doubtful accuracy.

     The a, h coefficients for the 'year' are the arithmetic means of those
for ' winter ' and ' summer ' ; but as a check on the accuracy of the work
they were calculated independently.

     Resolution in and perpendicular to the magnetic meridian is some-

what inconvenient when the general features of terrestrial magnetism are
being considered, owing to the complicated relationships between the
magnetic meridians at different stations. Even in dealing with the
phenomena extending over a long interval of time at a single .station, the

reference to a set of axes whose position is continually altering has its

disadvantages. When, however, the components of a force along two
rectangular axes are known, the components along any other pair in the
same plane are easily deduced when the inclination of the old to the new

axes is given. It will thus suffice to state that for the epoch 1890-9-1 the

mean magnetic meridian at Kew lay at 17° 36'-2 to the west of the

astronomical meridian.

     § 12. Instead of giving explicitly the components in and perpendicular
to the astronomical meridian I propose to consider the magnitude and
direction of the resultant horizontal disturbing force itself. Denoting its

intensity by p, its inclination to the east of magnetic north by 4', we

have to a sufficiently close degree of approximation

j^=tan-'(-aY/^X)=tan-'(-<D.H/^H)

     Remembering that the inclination of p to the astronomical north is

--\I/ (17° 36''2), it would be found a simple matter to deduce the com-

ponents of the disturbing force along and perpendicular to the astro-

nomical meridian from the calculated values of /< and xp.
     The following table, VII., gives the values of n and 4j for the mean of

December and January, or midwinter, the mean of June and July, or
midsummer, and the mean for the year at each hour. The greatest and

least values of p in each case are in heavy type.
     In comparing Tables IV. and VII. the reader will require to notice that

the former refers to lO** cH, the latter to 10^^>. Table VII. was got out
from arithmetical means proceeding to two places beyond those retained
in Table IV., and an extra figure was retained in so that the arith-

                                                                                                                                                                                                               i>,

metical accuracy of any resolution of p into orthogonal coordinates should

Vie as trustworthy as its previous resolution into cX and fY, i.e., into cH.

'midsummer,' and for hours subsequent to 18 in 'midwinter ' and ' year,'

hour.

     In the case of the yearly mean the vector p has a continuously pro-

gressive rotation from east to west through south, like the sun as seen
from the earth. This is the general character of the rotation at any
season ; but at midwinter there is an unmistakable retrograde motion in

the early morning for several hours, and at midsummer there is at least
a suspicion of a retrograde motion from 8 to 10 p.m. From 10 a.m. to

2 P.M., the time of the day when the diurnal inequality is most in
evidence, the value of ^ seems to vary very little with the season.

     Curves whose radius vector is p, and vectorial angle 4', illustrate the
variations of diurnal inequality in a conspicuous way. Numerous curves
of this kind, illustrating the results obtained at Greenwich for the years
1841-57, were given by Sir G. B. Airy in the 'Phil. Trans.' for 1863,
and a smaller number, refeiTing apparently to the years 1873-7.5, were also
given by Airy in the 'Phil. Trans.' for 1885. Several applications of
these curves to Dublin results appear in Dr. Lloyd's ' Treatise.' Following
these examples I have drawn curves 11, 12, and 1.3, Plate VI., based on
the results in Table VII., for midwinter, midsummer, and the whole year.
The hours are stated beside the points on the curves to which they refer.

     The prominent loop on the midwinter curve should be noticed. The
existence of a loop on the mean winter curve and its absence in the mean
summer curve for Dublin are referred to by Lloyd {loc. cit., p. 187). The
tendency to loops in winter months is conspicuous in Airy's Greenwich

curves.

   Relative Intensity of the Forces to ichich the Diurnal Inequality is due

                                              throughout the year.

     § 13. Without knowing the true nature of the disturbing force or
forces to which the diurnal inequality is due, it is difficult to suggest any
wholly satisfactory measure of intensity. Assuming the inequality to be

a composite phenomenon, the counteraction of opposing forces may produce

the same effect at one hour as the absence of forces at another. All the
phenomena seem, however, to point to greatly increased activity of dis-
turbins: forces in summer. The data s;iven above as to the mean values
of p throughout the day at midwinter and midsummer make the former
mean only -374 of the latter. Evidence in the same direction is supplied
by the following table VIII., which gives for each month, each quarter and
half-year, and for the whole year, the sum of the hourly departures from
the mean for the day, irrespective of sign, along with the range, or algebrai-
cal difference between the extremes. To show how comparatively little
depends on how the non-cyclic element is dealt with, the table, in addition
to the results obtained after the non-cyclic element has been eliminated,
gives likewise the range deduced from the uncorrected data for each
month. The fractions, which the table records, refer exclusively to the

corrected data.

     The range and the sum of the inequalities in both declination and
horizontal force show a distinct minimum in December. In the declina-
tion both the range and the sum of the inequalities present an absolute
maximum in August, with apparently a second, only slightly smaller
 maximum, in May. The variation, however, especially of the range, is so
 small from April to August that it would hardly be safe to conclude this
 was the normal phenomenon in a year of ' quiet ' days. In the horizontal
force there would appear to be a single maximum, whether for range or
 sum of inequalities, in July ; but the difference between the results and
 those for May, June, and August is extremely small.

      § 14. These conclusions are only partly in accord with those got out by
 Dr. Balfour Stewart · for a long series of years, 1858-73, at Kew, and by

Mr. W. EUis,^ for a still longer series of years, 1841-77, at Greenwich.

Dr. Stewart and Mr. Ellis. The different character of the materials
employed in the several cases must be borne in mind. Dr. Stewart took

into account all observations except the comparatively small percentage

falling under General Sabine's definition of disturbed, and Mr. Ellis took
all but days of considerable magnetic disturbance ; thus the material
dealt with by both possessed presumably much greater heterogeneousness
than that dealt with in Table VIII. Again, the mode in which the
results were treated was difl'erent. Dr. Stewart, it is true, apparently
took the means from groups of four successive years, but Mr. Ellis took
the mean of the ranges deduced from each single year's records. The
taking a group of years probably depresses the mean range most in those
months in which the progress of the diurnal inequality is least regular.

In both cases the terms whose period is the full year are greatly pre-

dominant. There appears also in both cases an appreciable semi-annual

variation ; but the terms with shorter periods are very small, and little
weight can be attached to their numerical measure.

                                                                                   Annual Variation.

§lfi. The variation of a magnetic element throughout the year, like

its variation throughout a qidet day, is most simply regarded as composed

of two parts, a uniform drift or secular variatio7i, and a cyclic portion,
which may be called the anyiual inequality. This is a somewhat arbi-

trary separation. The increase of the horizontal force, for instance, from

year to year, got out from the observations of most observatories, is far

from uniform                                                     and if this be a true         phenomenon the hypothesis that the

secular drift is uniform throughout the whole of one year can hardly

claim a physical basis. It is, however, at any rate a convenient mathe-
matical fiction whose adoption can do no harm when its true character

is explicitly recognised.

REPORT 1895.

--The following data are extracted from tlie annual Kew ' Reports ;

ture correction were considerably in error the consequence could hardly

be a regular annual variation, bub merely an increased probable error in

each individual observation.

   A second source of uncertainty is that the probable error in an abso-

lute observation and its comparison with the correspondir.g curve value

is somewhat lai'ge comj^ared to the annual inequality it is desired to

measure.

    Tlie number of observations, some twenty, on which the mean for each
month of the )nean year depends may seem sufficiently large to render

any mere observational error insigniticant. It must be remembered,

however, that on a considerable number of the days of absolute observa-

tion there proves to have been a good deal of magnetic movement. Some-

times the disturbance has been such as to render it necessary to discard

the observation entirely, and in other cases there is appreciable uncer-

tainty as to what is the true length of the curve ordinate to be taken as

an.swering to the observed absolute value. This will be readily under-

stood of the horizontal force, an absolute observation of which lasts

usually over an hour. The result of the absolute observation is a species

of mean value, to which some portions of the time occupied by the obser-

vation contribute more than others. The determinations of the declination

are less subject to uncertainties of this sort ; but on the other hand the
range of its annual inequality seems to bear a much smaller ratio to the

secular variation than in the case of the horizontal force.

     § 18. The natural outcome of the second class of errors would obviously
be a series of fictitious discontinuities in passing fi'om one month to
another of a year. As a matter of fact there did appear an unnatural

amount of fluctuation in the figures obtained for the annual inequalities

from the mean values answering to the middle of the months. To get

rid of this I have deduced the annual inequalities in the following table,

X., from a series of values, each of which is the arithmetic mean of the

actually observed means of two consecutive months. These arithmetic

means are attributed to the first day of the second month of the two.

The first two columns of the table give the departures from the mean

for the year of the actually observed means for the individual months
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

so that anyone who prefers to deduce the annual inequalities from these

can easily do so.

     I ought to explain that in calculating Table X. some slight differences

were introduced from the declination results for 1890 published in the Kew

· Report.' The declination curves for that year had been standardised by

treating as a whole the absolute observations and corresponding curve

measurements throughout the year, instead of taking each month sepa-

rately. I have thought it best to remove this peculiarity of treatment,

referring for the purpose to the absolute observations for the year, of

which, of course, the record remained.

The numerically greatest and least values in the annual inequality

columns are in heavy type.

The ranges given by Table X. for the annual inequalities, viz., l'"22

for the declination and 10"'' X 129 for the horizontal force, would be
increased to l'-52 and 10"^ X 141 respectively if the monthly means, for

the middle of each month, were taken and corrected for secular variation.

§ 19. The results obtained for the annual inequalities arc much

smoother and more consistent than might have been expected ; but taking
into account the smallncss of the apparent ranges, and the fact that the

G. B. Airy > from the two periods 1841-47 and 1848-57. The results for
these two periods, however, it must be said, differ widely between them-
selves, the range deduced from the first being nearly thrice that deduced

from the second period.

     Thinking more light desirable in the face of these discordances, I got
out the annual inequality for the mean of the five years 1887-91 from the
results published annually in Table XI. of the Greenwich ' Magnetical

and Meteorological Observations.' Proceeding as in Table X., i.e. taking
means for the first of each month, and applying the secular correction 6''4
deduced from the Greenwich tables, I obtain an inequality whose

resemblances to that shown in Table X. are not more conspicuous than

the divergences.

The largest easterly declination appears in April-May, the largest

westerly declination in September -October, and the range, 0'"6, is even

smaller than in Table X. Against these comparative agreements must,

however, be set the fact that the first three months of the year show an

easterly departure from the mean.

The divergences in the results obtained for the annual inequality of

declination do not, of course, necessarily imply that any of them are erro-

neous. The phenomena at any one station might not unnaturally present
-- --considerable variations
                         at least in range  from  year to            year                         and it  is
                                                                                               ;

conceivable that local influences may be more effective in this than in

other phenomena. It has also to be borne in mind that the data em-

ployed at the several stations were selected on different principles. Still,

I am doubtful whether any more definite conclusion should be drawn

than that the annual inequality of declination near London is at present

a very small quantity.

     § 20. The annual inequality of horizontal force shown in Table X. is,
comparatively speaking, large and unmistakable ; its range is a large
fraction of the secular variation. In this instance there is a very fair

agreement with the results given on pp. 166, 167 of Lloyd's ' Treatise ' for

Dublin on the mean of the years 1841-50, the most conspicuous differ-

ence being that the Dublin range was some 50 per cent, in excess of that

given by Table X.

The only previous determinations, so far as I know, of the annual

Kewvariation of the horizontal force at  are those of General Sabine '^ and

Dr. Balfour Stewart,^ for the epochs 1857-62 and 1863-68 respectively.
The former found the horizontal force, corrected for secular change, to be
on an average about -00012 C.G.S. units higher in summer than in

winter, while the latter found no difference. This divergence might be

attributed to the epochs considered being different ; but I feel consider-

able doubt as to the data employed having being adequate. They appear
to have been in both cases simply the results of the absolute observations,
uncorrected by reference either to the magnetograph curves or to the

diurnal variation.

    In conclusion, I have much pleasure in acknowledging my indebted-
ness to Mr. T. W. Baker, chief assistant, and Mr. R. S. Whipple, librarian
at Kew Observatory, for explanations as to the methods of standardising

the magnetic curves at Kew, and for other valuable information and

assistance.

    H. E. Armstrong (Secretary), Professor W. R. Dunstan, Mr.

     George Gladstone, Sir John Lubbock, Sir Philip Magnus, Sir
     H. E. RoscoE, and Professor S. P. Thompson.

At the meeting of the Britisli Association for the Advancement of

Science, held at Sheffield in 1879, a Committee was appointed with
reference to the examination in the scientific specific subjects of the Code
in Elementary Schools. Mr. Mundellawas the first Chairman, but he was
unable to continue such, as he shortly afterwards became Vice-President
of the Committee of Council on Education. The Committee was re-
appointed next year, with the object of reporting on the manner in which
rudimentary science should be taught, as well as examined. In 1881 the
Committee was again reappointed to watch and report on the working of

the proposed Revised New Code, and of other legislation afiecting the

teaching of science in Elementary Schools. In November of that year
the Committee agreed upon certain recommendations, which were adopted
by the Council of the Association and transmitted to the Education
Department. The Government adopted some of these recommendations
in whole or in part. Since that date the Committee has been continued
 annually, and has regularly reported on the progress of the teaching of
 natural science in Elementary Schools. It has also used its influence in

 respect of the great question of technical instruction, the formation of school
 museums. Evening Continuation Schools, and other matters that have

come before the Legislature. When the Royal Commission on Elementary

 Education was sitting, the Council of the British Association adopted a
 Resolution of this Committee, authorising one of its members to give
 evidence before the Commission, which was done accordingly. The
 question of the method of teaching science to classes of young children
 has also been considered recently, and formed part of the Report of the

 Committee. As the object of this Committee more directly affects those

 sections which deal with natural science, it was reappointed last year under

 the auspices of Section B.

      With regard to the progress of scientific instruction in Elementary
 Schools, the number of departments of schools in which the following
 class subjects were examined by Her Majesty's Inspector during the eight
 years 1882 to 1890, when English was obligatory, were as follows :

    With regard to the teaching of Mechanics, which has attained a
development, within the last few years, far greater in j^roportion than any

other of the scientific subjects, it is very satisfactory to note that of the
21,532 scholars above enumerated, no less than 3,407 had reached the
third stage of the syllabus, while 7,296 were examined in the second

Stage. Considering how rapidly the elder children drop out of school

after they have passed the legal Standard of exemption, these figures augur
well for the value placed upon the instruction in this subject, which has
become almost a speciality of the London, Liverpool, Birmingham, and
some of the other large School Boards, and which is almost entirely carried
on by special instructors on the peripatetic system.

     The sudden rise of more than 50 per cent, in the last two years in the
number of students in Chemistry does not admit of any such proportion
being found in the lai,er stages ; but considerably over one-fourth of the
whole were examined in the second and third stages. The recognition of

the importance of experimental teaching is leading to the establishment-
of well-appointed laboratories by some of the School Boards, such as

those of Hove and Handsworth, which can be made to serve also for the

teaching of this science in the Evening Continuation Schools.
     Estimating the number of scholars in Standards V., VI., and VII. at

570,000, the percentage of the number examined in these specific subjects
as compared with the number of children qualified to take them is 20-9

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but it should be remembered that many of the children take more than
one subject for examination. The following table gives the percentage for

each year since 1882 :

     The returns of the Education Department given above refer to the
whole of England and Wales, and are for the school years ending with
August 31. The statistics of the London School Board are brought up to
the year ending with Lady Day, 1895. They also illustrate the great
advance that has been made in the teaching of Elementary Science as a
class subject, and they give the number of children as well as the number

of departments.

tarily after a hard day's work in school ; the conditions under which such
classes are held must therefore be made as easy as possible if they are
to be successful, and the sympathy and enthusiasm of the teacher are to be

aroused.

     During the last year some fifty or sixty teachers under the London
Board went through practical courses at the demonstrator's laboratory in
Whitechapel, where the accommodation will soon be quite insufficient to
meet the requirements of the district. Full and comijlete notes and sug-

gestions were issued to all teachers attending the courses, which were

much appreciated. The development of the work is largely due to the

establishment of this system of normal classes.

In the meantime the question of science teaching in girls' schools' has

not been left unattacked. Two schools have now adopted a course of

Adomestic science in lieu of domestic economy.   syllabus has been

devised to deal as far as possible with the natui-e of the processes and the

Amaterials employed in the household.       short course of measurement

and weighing has been inti'oduced with the double object of familiarising

the scholars with the decimal system and making them acquainted with

the instruments they will have to use in accurate experimental work.
The general effects of heat on matter, and their application to the work of
the laundry and kitchen, are then studied ; the modes of cooking and some
of the simpler changes involved, chemistry of air and water, combustion,

fuel, soap, hardness of water, and finally a few lessons are given on the
mechanics of the household, such as the structure of taps, locks, gas fit-

tings, hot-water boilers, flushing tanks, &c.
     Classes have been held for the mistresses in this subject at the

laboratory, and it is generally considered by those who have been through

the course to combine mental training with the acquirement of valuable

information. Except that the physiological part of the Domestic Economy

is not touched, most of the important work in that syllabus which can be
dealt with by scientific methods has been considered.

     During the coming winter classes will be held at Berner-street

Laboratory, London, E., in all stages of Elementary Natural Philosophy
and Domestic Science syllabuses, but it is only too clear that this course
involves commencing at the wrong end. Before any great headway is
made, work of this nature must be introduced into the teachers' course of
training, and to this end it is essential that teaching on the lines of the

new syllabuses must be started in the Pupil Teachers' and Training

Colleges.

ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 233

the Code of 1893 furnishes interesting data as to the instruction in

scientific subjects in these schools. Your Committee drew attention in

tlieir Report for 1893 to the development which was taking place at that

time in this direction ; but pointed out that the Government return of

Athat year did not furnish precise information on the point.           new table

has been introduced this year, which gives the information desired. In the

following table your Committee give the number of ' units for payment

of the grant by the Education Department for the several scientific sub-

jects taken throughout England and Wales during the session 1893-94,

to which is appended a similar return for the schools under the London

School Board, extracted from the Board's Annual Report upon their

Evening Continuation Schools. It may be necessary to explain that the

' unit ' means a complete twelve hours of instruction received by each

scholar, fractions of twelve hours not counting.

     The total number of units is (for England and Wales) 51,607, whereas
the number of scholars is 41,960, indicating that about one-fourth of them
must have received at least twenty-four hours of instruction. It is evident
that London is far behind the country in general in the teaching of these

science subjects in their Evening Continuation Schools, excepting in the
matter of Mechanics and Magnetism and Electricity. The stronghold of
this instruction is in Manchester and the other manufacturing districts.

     It is especially intei'esting to note that 3,696 students took up Chemis-

try, and that a much larger number took the comparatively new subjects
of Elementary Physics and Chemistry, and the Science of Common Things.
Your Committee has already on a former occasion (1893) expressed

approval of the course on Elementary Physics and Chemistry in the
Evening School Code, which is a practical course intended to be carried
out experimentally by the scholars themselves, and deals, not with defini-

tions or descriptions, but with actual facts. The course on the Science of

Common Things is a' brief survey of the physical properties of bodies,
serving to determine their uses and relative value.' It may be looked

upon as an introduction to physical and biological science in general, and
to its application to ordinary and domestic life.

     In their last Report your Committee referred to the difficulties inter-
                    ;

--234 REPORT 1895.

posed by the regulations of the Code in making visits for the purposes of

education to such places as Kew Gardens, the South Kensington Museum,

&c., although the Science and Art Department have recognised the educa-
tional value of such attendances ; and stated that Mr. Acland had favour-
ably received a deputation on the subject, and promised increased facilities.
This promise has been fulfilled ; and the Code of this year provides that
the time spent during school-hours in visiting museums, art galleries, and

other institutions of educational value may count towards the time re-
quired for an attendance at school. Her Majesty's Inspectors are more-

over instructed to encourage these visits wherever such institutions exist.
It is stipulated that the teacher in charge should not have, as a rule,
more than fifteen scholars with him, and that no visits should be paid
unless some person competent to give information of a kind interesting to
young children is present. All these regulations appear wise and proper,

so that the real object of visits to these institutions may be attained ; and

the limitation of them to twenty in the course of the school year is not
unreasonable, as, with all the other matters that demand attention, more

time cei-tainly could not well be spared.

     The only other alteration of importance in the Code that concerns your
Committee is the new stipulation that object lessons must be given in all
schools to the children in Standards I., II., and III., and an excellent circu-
lar to Her Majesty's Inspectors has recently been issued, pointing out the
true aim and nature of object teaching. It commences by drawing attention
to the two kinds of instruction which are often confused : (1) observation
of the object itself, and (2) giving information about the object. It dwells
upon the impoi'tance of the distinction, adding, ' Object teaching leads the
scholar to acquire knowledge by observation and experiment ; and no
instruction is properly so called unless an object is presented to the

learner, so that the addition to his knowledge may be made through the

senses.' It enforces the selection of subjects which can appeal to the

hands and eyes of the scholars, stating that ' however well the lesson may

be illustrated by diagrams, pictures, models, or lantern slides, if the chil-
dren have no opportunity of handling or watching the actual object
which is being dealt with, the teacher will be giving an information lesson
rather than an object lesson.' . . . ' It is Elementary Science only in so far
as it aids the child to observe some of the facts of nature upon which
natural science is founded ; but as it deals with such topics without formal

arrangement, it differs widely from the systematic study of a particular

science.' The circular contains many suggestions on the choice of objects
the avoidance of what is purely technical ; the making of drawings or
models both by teacher and children ; the relation of the parts of the

object to the whole ; and the leading the children to describe accurately
what they have seen. Several complete schemes are given for guidance in

the appendix to the circular.
      The Parliamentary Committee which has been considering the question

of decimal weights and measures, under the chairmanship of one of your
Committee, Sir Henry E. E,oscoe, has just reported in favour of the per-
 missive use of the metric system for all purposes for the next two yeai's,
 after which that system should become obligatory. It recommends that
 it should be taught in all public schools as a necessary and integral part
 of Arithmetic. The Elementary School Code has, for some years past,
 contained a note to the effect that 'the scholars in Standards V., VI., and
VII. should know the principles of the metric system,' but it has not
                         --

received much attention while so much time had to be spent upon the

tables of weights and measures in ordinary use. When these cease to be

lef'al, not only will the teaching of Arithmetic be rendered more rational,
but ii large amount of time will be set free which can be applied to the
promotion of science teaching.

     Looking back over the years that have elapsed since the passing of the
first Elementary Education Act, it is evident that the constant tendency
has been to add to the curriculum of the schools ; and some of the most
recently recommended additions to the time-table include manual instruc-
tion and physical exercises. The difficulty of finding time for these has
led to the suggestion that the generally recognised hours of schooling
might be extended in the case of the elder scholars. This course would
involve some practical inconveniences ; and in view of the fact that the

children pass their Standards now at an earlier and more immature age

than they did some years ago, it is a question worth consideration whether
the time has not arrived when the recognised school age should be raised
from thirteen to fourteen, and the work of the Standards made to spread
over this extended period. Such an arrangement would have the manifest
advantage of affording a broader and more practical education, without

over-pressure to either the teachers or the taught.

--Quantitative Analysis hy means of Electrolysis. Second Report of the

     Committee^ consisting of Professor J. Emerson Reynolds {Chair-

    man)^ Dr. C. A. KoHN (Secretary), Professor P. Frankland, Pro-
    fessor F. Clowes, Dr. Hugh Marshall, Mr. A. E. Fletcher,

     Mr. D. H. Nagel, Mr. T. Turner, a7id Mr. J. B. Coleman.

A PRELIMINARY report was furnished by the Committee last year in which

the contemplated plan of work was outlined.
     The bibliography of the subject has been completed and is ap-

pended.

The experimental work has been carefully organised, and the results

on the determination of bismuth and of tin are nearly complete. Other

work is in progress, but the Committee prefer to hold over these results

until next year in order that they may be added to and may include

methods of separation of some of the metals.

Considerable attention has been given to the choice and arrangement

Aof the special apparatus required.  detailed description of the arrange-

ments adopted will be given in the next report.

As the bibliography is completed, the Committee propose to devote

their attention during the coming year exclusively to experimental

inquiries.

THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SPECTROSCOPY.  263

--The Bibliography of Spedroscopij. Report of the Committee, consistimj

    of Professor H. McLeod, Professor W. 0. Roberts Austen, Mr.

     H. G. Madan, cmd Mr. D. H. Nagel.

Progress has been made with the catalogue of spectroscopic literature,
which has now been brought nearly up to date ; but, in view of the diffi-
culty of obtaining assistance from any one who is within reach of the
great scientitic libraries, the Committee do not see their way to its further

continuance.

     They therefore propose to bring the catalogue to a conclusion at the
end of the present ;year, so as to form a twenty -five-years' record of spec-

troscopic literature.

     Four instalments of the list of papers have been already issued, and
will be found in the reports of the Association for 1881, 1884, 1889, and
1894. The inconvenience of having to refer to four distinct volumes in
order to obtain a complete list of papers on any particular subject is
obvious, and the Committee strongly lecommend that all the separate
instalments should be collected, rearranged, and issued as one continuous

catalogue. Mr. Madan is quite willing to undertake gratuitously all the

labour of doing this, the only question is that of expense of printing.

    In an estimate obtained last year, Messrs. Spottiswoode & Co. stated

that the cost of printing 500 copies of the first three instalments (1881,
1884, and 1889) would be about 95^. The cost, therefore, of printing the
whole catalogue would be about 130^.

     If the above recommendation is approved by the Association, the Com-
mittee would suggest that the Association might undertake the responsi-
bility of the cost of printing, and be recouped (in part at least) by the
charge of 2s. 6(7. per copy (which would produce 62^. 10s.). Or a higher

charge might be made.

   --It appears, moreover, not unlikely that other scientific societies the
--Royal Society, the Chemical Society, and the Physical Society might be

induced to make grants, if, as is hoped, the catalogue would be of value
to those who are engaged in physical research.

     The Committee desire to present the above subject for discussion, and
ask to be reappointed for one more year in order to finish their work.

--The Action of Light upon Dyed Colours. Report of the Committee,

     consisting of Dr. T. E. Thorpe {Chairman), Professor J. J.

    Hummel (Secretary), Dr. W. H. Perkin, Professor W. J. Eussell,
    Captain W. de W. Abney, Professor W. Stroud, and Professor

     R. Meldola. (Brawn up Jiy the Secretary.)

During the past year (1894-95) the work of this Committee has been
continued, and a large number of wool and silk patterns, dyed with vari-
ous natural and artificial refZ, orange, and yellow colouring matters, have
been examined with respect to their power of resisting the fading action

of light.

     Similar patterns were exposed to light in the years 1892-93 and
1893-94, and have already been repoi-ted upon, but for want of sufficient
264 KEPORT-- 1895.

exposing space certain important groups of colouring matters had to

remain unrepresented, e.g., the Congo Reds, itc. These have now been

examined, together with additional coal-tar colouring matters recently-

introduced, also certain Indian dyestufFs. With some few exceptions,
therefore, all the available red, orange, and yellow colours, as applied to
wool and silk, have now been exposed.

     The general method of preparing the dyed patterns, and the manner
of exposing them under glass, with free access of air and moisture, were
the same as already adopted.

     The thanks of the Committee are again due to James A. Hirst, Esq.,
in whose grounds the patterns were exposed at Adel, near Leeds.

     Each dyed pattern was divided into six pieces, one of which was
protected from the action of light, while the others were exposed for
different periods of time. These ' periods of exposure ' were made equivalent
to those adopted in previous years by exposing, along with the patterns,
special series of ' standards,' dyed with the same colouring matters as were
then selected for this purpose. The standards were allowed to fade to the
same extent as those which marked off the ' fading period ' in previous years,
before being renewed or removing a set of dyed patterns from the action
of light. The patterns exposed during the past year are therefore
comparable, in respect of the amount of fading which they have ex-

pei'ienced, with the dyes already reported upon.
     The patterns were all put out for exposure on June 20, 1894, cer-

--tain sets being subsequently removed on the following dates : July 14,

August 20, September 22, 1894 ; April 13, July 16, 1895. Of these five
'periods of exposure' thus marked off, periods 1, 2, 3 were equivalent to
each other in fading power, whereas periods 4 and 5 were each equivalent
to four of the first period in this respect ; hence fi%'e patterns of each
colour have been submitted respectively to an amount of fading equal

--to 1, 2, 3, 7, and 11 times that of the first 'fading period' selected viz.

June 20 to July 14, 1894.
     The dyed and faded patterns have again been entered in pattern-card

books in such a manner that they can be readily compared with each other.
      The following tables give the general result of the exposure experi-

ments made during the year 1894-95, the colours being divided, according

to their behaviour towards light, into the following five classes : very
fugitive, fugitive, moderately fast, fast, very fast.

     The initial numbers refer to the order of the patterns in the pattern-
books. The S. and J. numbers refer to Schultz and Julius's ' Tabel-

larische Uebersicht der kiinstlichen organischen Farbstoffen.'
      In the case of colouring matters requiring mordants, the particular

mordant employed is indicated in brackets after the name of the dye-

stuff.

                        EED COLOURING MATTERS.

                 Class I. Very Fugitive Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class have faded so rapidly that at the end of the
first 'fading period' (June 20 to July 14, 1894) only a very faint colour
remains, and at the end of the fifth period (one year) all traces of the
original colour have disappeared, the woollen cloth being either quite white
or merely of a faint tint which ^aiies according to the colour of the origi-

nal pattern.

    Notes.--Rosazurin B and G become yellower during the fading process,

a change which is still more pronounced in the case of Naphthylene Red.
The Barwood and Sanderswood reds become brown during the first fading
period, and then rapidly fade to a pale drab, and finally, at the end of a

year, to a buff colour.

                         Class II. Fugitive Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class show very marked fading at the end of the
second 'fading period ' (July 14 to August 20, 1894), and after a year's
exposure they have entirely faded, or only a tint remains.

  --Notes. Fast Acid Magenta becomes uiuch bluer during the

fading period, and assumes quite a purple colour, which gradually fades to

a purplish grey. Its behaviour is quite unlike that of ordinary Acid

Magenta, but very similar to that of Magenta itself, from which it is no

doubt derived.

Emin Red is one of the more fugitive colours of this class, and might

almost be placed in Class I.

   RIso-Rubin behaves like ordinary Magenta, and changes during the

first fading period to a purple, which soon fades still further.

The colours given by Ventilago madra'ipatann,'Li\xmh^oodia,\\A Camwood,

with tin mordant, are all a little faster than with aluminium. The Cam-

wood, Barwood and Sanderswood colours with aluminium and tin mordants

all become brown and apparently darker  during  the  first  fading  period
                                                                                          ;

those obtained with tin mordant become much darker, and are somewhat

faster than the corresponding aluminium colours. This marked alteration

in hue during the early stages of the fading process is characteristic of

these dyestufis, and distinguishes them readily from Ventilago madra-

spatana and Limawood.

          Class III. Moderately Fast Colours. (Wool.)

The colours of this class show distinct fading at the end of the second

period (July 14 to August 20, 1894), which becomes more pronounced at

Athe end of the third period (August 20 to September 22, 1894).     pale tint

only remains at the end of the fourth period (September 22, 1894, to

April 13, 1895), and at the end of a year's exposure the colour has en-

tirely faded, or, at most, mere traces of colour remain.

this dyestuff belongs to the Triphenylmethan colours, a group which
usually only furnishes fugitive dyes. Violamine is considerably faster
than the closely allied Rhodamine, which has been classed as a ' fugitive

colour (see Report, 1892-93).

   --Notes. This class includes several colours of the alizarin group, so

-well known for their general fastness to light, washing, milling, &c. The
superior fastness of the red given by Chay-root, as compared with that

obtained from Madder, is no doubt due to the absence of Purpurin in the

former.

     The colours given by Lac-dye and Cochineal with tin mordant are dis-
tinctly faster than those with alumina.

     Most noteworthy is the remarkable fastness of Diamine Fast Red,
since it belongs to the so-called ' Congo Colours,' a group which, as already
stated, usually supplies only such red dyes as possess at most a moderate

fastness to light.

--Notes. Tannin Orange II deserves special notice since it is superior

in fastness to all other basic yellows hitherto examined.

     The Indian dyestuff Kamala has been regarded by some as a fast dye-

stuff, but as applied to wool it cannot be so regarded ; applied to silk,

however, it is very much faster.

   -- RNotes. Benzo Orange becomes yellower during fading ; at the end

of a year's exposure there remains an olive-yellow of medium intensity.
With aluminium and tin mordants the fastness is about the same as with

chromium.

    GToluylene Orange and Cotton Yellow G, dyed as acid-colours, were

exposed last year and placed in this same class. The fastness of the
former is the same with chromium, aluminium, and tin mordants ; the
fastness of the latter is greatest with chromium.

     The comparative fastness of the colour given by Morinda-root without
the use of any mordant is somewhat interesting.

     The bright orange-yellow colour produced by the action of commercial
nitric acid on wool, now known as Xanthoproteic Acid, was at one time
supposed to be identical with Picric Acid. Apart from the very decided
ditference in shade of the two dyes, these exposure experiments confirm

most conclusively the present view that they are distinct colouring
matters. Picric Acid yellow rapidly changes from a pure lemon-yellow

to orange on exposure to light, whereas the orange-yellow colour due to
Xanthoproteic Acid undergoes no such change ; it merely becomes in the

early stages of fading a little duller and apparently slightly darker. Its

behaviour under the influence of light is very similar to that of such

colours as Curcumein and Azoflavin (reported upon last year), and may

possibly indicate that Xanthoproteic Acid belongs to the class of Nitro-
azo colours ; at present its constitution is entirely unknown.

                Class IV. Fast Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class show comparatively little fading during the

first, second, and third periods. At the end of the fourth ' period of ex-

posure ' a pale shade remains, which at the end of the year's exposure still

leaves a pale tint.

  --Notes. The fastness to light of all the azoxy colours here mentioned

is so good that they might be almost equally well placed among the 'very

fast ' colours.

     The Direct Orange 'IR here referred to is quite distinct from the
colouring matter of the same name mentioned in last year's Report, and

there classed as a ' very fugitive ' colour.

   R NCresotin Yellow and Diamine Yellow were exposed last year,

applied as acid-colours. Here, where they are applied on chromium
mordant, they appear to be little or no faster to light ; applied on
aluminium and tin mordants they are distinctly more fugitive.

                         Class V. Very Fast. (Wool.)

   The colours of this class show a very gradual fading during the different
periods, and even after a year's exposure a moderately good colour remains.

272 REPORT-- 1895.

  --Notes. The following Azo colours, reported upon last year, were ex-

posed after having been applied as acid-colours : Hessian Yellow, Chrjs-
amine E, and G, Cresotin Yellow G, and Carbazol Yellow. Those exposed
during the past year, and reported upon now, were applied upon chromium

mordant. The results now obtained show that all these colours when
dyed on chromium mordant are distinctly faster to light than when dyed

as acid-colours. An important additional advantage of the chromium

coloui'S is that even after a year's exposure the faded colours appear level,
showing none of the speckled appearance so frequently noticed with the

faded colours dyed by the acid method. When these colours are applied on

aluminium and tin mordants they are more fugitive, and may then be

classed as ' fast ' or ' moderately fast.'

     It may be noticed that Madder, Munjeet, and Purpurin give faster

colours with tin than with aluminium mordant.

                                               Silk Patterns.

     All the foregoing colours were also dyed on silk, and the patterns were
exposed to light, along with those on wool, with the result that the rela-
tive fastness of the various colours was practically the same as on wool.

     The only exceptions were the colours obtained from Morinda-root and
from Kamala. Morinda yellow, dyed without the aid of any mordant,
is much faster on silk than on wool, and although the colour becomes
brownish during exposure, it may be classed as ' fast ' on silk.

     The Indian dyestufi' Kamala was reported upon last year and classed
as a ' fugitive ' colour. This year the orange-yellow colour exposed was
obtained by applying it in conjunction with alum, and found to be much
faster than the colour obtained by dyeing in a simple alkaline bath (Na^CO^).

A sample of the rich red-orange colour dyed in India was also exposed.

Both dyes examined this year may be classed as ' moderately fast.'

--Isomeric Naphthalene Derivatives. Ninth Report of the Committee,

    consisting of Professor W. A. Tilden and Professor H. E. Arm-

     strong. {Brawn up hy Professor Armstrong.)

In previous reports reference has frequently been made to the trichloro-

naphthalenes : during the past year Dr. Wynne and the writer have at

length completed their examination of this series, and have satisfied them-

selves of the existence of 14, but only 14, such compounds, which is
Ain accordance with theory.
                             complete table of the 14 trichloronaphtha-

lenes having been published in the ' Chemical Society's Proceedings,'

No. 151, 1895, p. 85, it is unnecessary here to further refer to them.

It may be mentioned that the series is the largest hitherto known

isomeric series.

     In completing the work on this subject not only have numerous pre-

parations been required, but it has been necessary also to make many

chlorine determinations, and the grant has been expended chiefly on these

latter. I am specially indebted to Mr. R. L. Jenks for his assistance in

the analytical work.

The work of the Committee has been actively continued during a con-

sidei-able part of the past year.

     The various preliminary difficulties involved in the preparation of
pure materials, and especially of chlorine, have now been largely over-
come, and it is anticipated that considerable progress will be made during
the coming year in investigating the behaviour of highly purified chlorine,
and the Committee ask to be reappointed for this purpose.

   A considerable part of the grant made to meet expenses already

incurred in 1894 remains in hand, and therefore it is not necessary to ask
for a further grant this year.

How shall Agriculture lest obtain the Help of Science? By R.

     Warington, M.A., F.K.S., Professor of Rural Economy, Oxford.

[Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.l

Our discussion to-day will, I trust, have practical results. The time is
certainly ripe for decided steps being taken. No doubt exists in the

mind of any one that British agriculture is in great need of some powerful
helping hand, which, in popular phraseology, shall 'put it on its legs
again.' There is probably also no doubt in the mind of any person in

this room that, if the farmer is to be enabled to do his best, agriculture
must be advanced from its original condition as an art, and that in future
its operations must be conducted with the full assistance of natural

science. The so-called ' practical man ' may indeed believe that the

question we have met to discuss will be at once set aside as profitless if

we raise the preliminary question, Do you believe that the assistance of

natural science will remove agricultural depression? I answer at once

that I do not know that it will, but that this is no reason for declining

the aid which science offers. When a sick man calls in a physician he
does not ask the preliminary question, Do you promise to restore me to

full health ? If the question were asked, the physician would positively

decline to make any such promise ; and yet the sick man would place

himself unreservedly in the physician's hands, feeling that he could

not do better than make use of the best knowledge of the day on the

subject of his complaint. Now agricultural science should mean the

best knowledge of the day on the subject of agriculture, and a farmer

will surely do wisely to obtain the aid of this knowledge in all his

operations.

We have now to consider in what manner, by what methods, agricul-
Weture may best obtain the aid of science.
                                            might divide our answer to

Wethis question into two parts.  might say, in the first place, that the

science of agriculture is still only in its infancy, and that if agriculture is
--342
                        BEPORT 1895,

to be effectively aided by science it is necessary that there should be a

agreat increase in the number of practical investigations of agricultural
questions. In the second place, we should add, that all the investigation's

already made, or to be carried out, will fail of practical utility if the farmer

remains uninformed of the knowledge thus acquired. Our answer wouldl
thus be, that we require, firstly, an extended system of practical investiga-

tions; and, secondly, an effective scheme of agricultural education. All that

will be said to-day could probably be classed under one or other of these

two heads. I propose, however, in these opening remarks to adopt a less

logical division of the subject. In order that our discussion may not

assume an academic character, but may, if possible, lead to some practica,!

result, I will at once descend into the region of practical politics, and

endeavour to answer the question by pointing out what can most usefully

be done by (1) a Board of Agriculture, and (2) by County Councils, to

accomplish the objects of agricultural investigation and agricultural edu-

cation, which we believe to be so important.

There are certain kinds of woi'k which can be accomplished best by a

central organisation ;  work which is of general, national importance
                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

work which is necessary to form the basis of future developments. Such

work should be at once undertaken by the Government, through a Depart-

ment of Agriculture.

   We need a really complete agricultural and horticultural library, freely

open to the public. The literature of the subject is extremely large and
rapidly inci'easing ; much of it is quite beyond the reach of a private
individual, while it is of too special a character to be found in our
ordinary public libraries. To give one illustration. There are at the
present time about 300 fully equipped experiment stations in Europe
and America, besides many smaller institutions. The i-esults of their in-

vestigations are published in numerous reports and journals in many
languages. No person is able at present to refer to more than a small

part of this literature. Instead of consulting the original papers, one is
generally obliged to be content with the meagre abstracts furnished by a

German Jahresbericht or Centralblatt, and whatever does not find entrance
into these periodicals is lost to the general public. As an illustration of
what may be done in this direction by an energetic Board of Agriculture,
I may mention that the Department of Agriculture in the United States
compiles a card catalogue of all the published work of the fifty-five
American experiment stations, and supplies a copy of this catalogue tO'

each station.

   We need also an English journal published monthly, in which the

results of the most important agricultural investigations should be made

accessible to the general scientific public. The advantage of this to

teachers and investigators would be very great. As such a journal could

not be expected to pay its expenses, it should be published for the benefit
of the counti'y by the Government. The American ' Experiment Station
Record ' is an example of work done in this direction : it is chiefly, but

not exclusively, concerned with the investigations made at the American

stations.

     Another piece of work which belongs peculiarly to a central department

is the collection and preparation of national statistics. Statistics of acreage
under different crops, with the annual and average produce per acre, and the-
number of live stock in the United Kingdom, are collected and published

by the present Board. The Board that we desire would go much further
HOW SHALL AGRICULTURE BEST OBTAIN THE HELP OF SCIENCE ? 343

Wein tliis direction.  have at the present time no accurate idea of what is

the average composition of any portion of our agricultural pi'oduce, for tlie

simple reason that the collection of the scattered analyses, the rejection of

imperfect work, and the averaging of the remainder is so large an under-

taking that no private individual has had the courage to attempt the task.

The results of this present lack of national information are not unimport-

ant. "\^'e are obliged at the present time to employ German averages for

all purposes of teaching or calculation. These averages are in the main

prepared from German analyses, and relate to crops and foods grown in a

different climate, and under different conditions, to our own. In the

United States, the want of national statistics respecting the composition

of foods and crops has been supplied by their Department of Agriculture,

which has published in one volume more than 3,000 analyses of American-

»grown foods, all properly classified and averaged. In the same way the
results of American digestion experiments, made exclusively with

American foods and American animals, have been collected and pub-

lislied, thus again obviating the necessity for relying solely on German

figures.

    An efficient Department of Agriculture should be provided with a staff

of officers representing all the sciences connected with agriculture ; these
officers should be furnished with suitable laboratories, and all the machinery
reijuired for carrying out investigations and making reports. Thus
equipped the department would be able to attempt the solution of
agricultural problems of pressing importance. The work done at this
Government institution would also serve as a model for the investigations
carried on at the smaller experiment stations. The investigations thus

conducted with public money should be of a thoroughly practical character,
the results of which would have a direct bearing on the farmer's work.
Let me venture on a single illustration. Persian barley has lately been
imported into England in considerable quantity ; its price has been lower

than that of any other kind of barley in the market. A question at once

arises in the mind of the cattle-feeder, Is it really cheap 1 Will a sovereign
expended on these thin, shrivelled grains purchase a greater weight of food
substance, and fatten an animal better, than the same money spent on
English barley ? The farmer can neither make a chemical analysis nor
carry out an accurate feeding experiment, but a properly equipped
Department of Agricultui-e could do both, and in a few weeks issue a report
which would be of substantial benefit to the farmers of this country.

     Before leaving this part of the subject let us note what our brethren
across the water are doing in this matter. Canada, though a poor
country, and with a population of only five millions, has its central agri-
cultural laboratories, and its chemists and botanists employed under its
Department of Agriculture, and spends 15,000/. a year on the agiicultui'al
investigations conducted at the central station at Ottawa and at the four
provincial stations. In the United States the annual cost of the in-
vestigations carried out by the Central Department of Agriculture at
Washington cannot be less than 60,000^., and this is exclusive of the
cost of the work done at the fifty-five expeiimen,t stations in the ^ arious
States, towards which 150,000/. is annually contributed by the National

Government.'

     ' The figures quoted, both for Ciiuada and the United States, do not include the
very considerable sums .'pent for the same objects by tbe local governments in these

countries.
                                                               --

--344 REPORT 1895.

     We may certainly congratulate ourselves that we have at last a Board

of Agriculture, presided over by a Minister having a seat in the Cabinet.

The work done by the Board has already been of considerable benefit to

the country*. What we desire is that far larger means should be placed at

its disposal ; that the scope of its work should be enlarged ; and that,

especially, it should acquire a distinctly scientific character, which, as we

have already remarked, simply means that the best knowledge of the day

Weshould be enlisted in the service of agriculture.            shall feel ashamed,

I think, when I mention the sum at present devoted by the Board to the

purpose of investigation. The grants made for education and investiga-

tion in the year 1894-95 may be svimmarised as follows :

           Collegiate centres                                  £5,550
                                                                    950
           .......Dairy institutes                                  250
           ......Instruction in forestry
           Investigations by various associations . . . 650

                                                               7,400

     Thus 650Z. is the whole sum directly devoted by the Board to the

purpose of investigation : some portion of the sums contributed to colle-

giate centres may, however, be employed for this purpose, as experiments

are conducted by some of the colleges thus assisted.

     The 6,750?. distributed by the Board to educational institutions is

very wisely allotted to those giving a complete course of instruction.

The provision of a full course of training for teachers should always have

the first consideration in any educational movement.

     In referring to the present national expenditure on agricultural educa-

tion we must not omit the grants made by the Department of Science and

Art to science schools and classes teaching the principles of agriculture.

The total grant amounted in 1893-94 to the sum of 2,937?. The Depart-

ment has 7'ecently attempted to improve the instruction given in these

Aclasses.  new syllabus of the subject has been prepared for the use of

the teachers, with suggested experiments, and a few necessary diagrams.

The Honours examination has also been made much moi'e thorough.

   We next turn to the woi"k done in this country by local authorities.
WeThis is a very wide subject, and I can only glance at a few points.

all know that a really large sum of national money has been placed in the

hands of the local authorities dui'ing the last few years, which they can

use at their discretion for the purposes of technical and secondary educa-

tion. The sum thus placed at the disposal of the local authorities in

England for the year 1894-95 amounted to about 744,000?., of which

about 600,000?. was actually spent on education. The particular educa-

tional objects aided vary, of course, very much in different localities, and

it is only in the counties that we can expect to find the teaching of

agriculture occupying an important place. The annual grant at the

disposal of the English counties somewhat exceeds 400,000?. It is very

difficult to tell how much of this is devoted to agricultural purposes. In

the case of a few counties, as Kent, Bedfordshire, and Berkshire, it

would appear from the figures published in the ' Record of Technical

and  Secondary  Education  '       that  about  one-third  of  the total  grant  is
                                '

    ' I am indebted to the reports in this valuable periodical for much of the informa-

tion here given respecting the agricultural work of County Councils.
HOW SHALL AGRICULTURE BEST OBTAIN THE HELP OF SCIENCE? 345

allotted to agriculture, but in most counties the proportion is very much

less.

The mode in which this agricultural education is carried out is, of course,

very varied. It may consist simply in money aid to classes under the

Department  of  Science and  Art                       or  tlie  county may  have  its  own
                                                    ;

travelling lecturers, who deliver short courses on agriculture, horticul-

ture, dairy-work, poultry, bee-keeping, and the diseases of animals.

Purely technical classes on horse-shoeing, ploughing, hedging, draining,

are also common. The most popular, and certainly one of the most useful,

of these technical schools is the travelling daily, by which practical in-

struction in butter-making is given at many centres throughout the

county. As a help to a higher grade of instruction than is furnished by

tliese popular classes, the County Councils grant agricultural scholarships

available for the courses of instruction at agricultural schools and col-

leges, and in some in.stances at institutions of university rank. In a

few cases dairy institutes and agricultural colleges have been established

by County Councils, usually by the united action of two or three counties,

and in these cases considerable sums are annually set aside for their

support. The sketch we have given of County Council work will, how-

ever, leave a far too favourable impression if we do not bear in mind that

only a portion of the schemes mentioned are generally in use in any one

county.

     As it is clearly most imjDortant that these new schemes of agricultural
education should be wisely and efficiently carried out, we may profitably

devote a few minutes to the consideration of some important points upon

attention to which any real success will largely depend.

     With lads of the age at which they are usually in attendance at

elementary schools little can be done in teaching the scientific principles
of agriculture ; such lads have not acquired the previous scientific know-

ledge necessary for understanding what is to be taught. They may indeed

learn off answers to questions either from the blackboard or from a printed

text-book, and thus furnished they may pass examinations ; but the know-

ledge they have acquired is merely a knowledge of words, and will be of
no value to them in after-life. The foundation of habits of observation and
logical reasoning must, however, be laid in the elementary school if higher

instruction is hereafter to be given. This elementary training may
easily be made to have an agricultural bias. No better means of

educating a boy's powers of observation can be found than a study of the
individual characters and modes of development of the various crops,

weeds, and insects of the farm.

    When lads have passed thi'ough the elementary school their special

training should immediately commence ; any delay is most unfavourable to
the boy's development. The time has now come when a distinction has to
be made between the students ; some are to be labourers, some are to be

farmers. For both technical instruction is required : the arts of agricul-
ture have to be mastered.' The farmer's son, however, requires besides

this a higher course of study if scientific principles are to be inti'oduced

into his future practice. One great need of the present day is the esta-

blishment of secondary agricultural schools, which shall be centres both for

     ' In some countries, as Ireland and France, instruction in the art of agriculture is
given in connection with the elementary schools : this is, of course, possible if the
school engagements admit of time being thus spent, and there is convenient land

adjoining.
346 KEPORT-- 1895.

purely technical and for scientific instruction. The farmer's son on

entering such a school would commence at once his technical training, and

he would at the same time commence the study of elementary chemistry

and elementary biology and geology. Not till he had gone through

elementary courses on these subjects would he be prepared for instruction

in the scientific principles of agricultui-e.

It is from well-arranged schemes, in which the instruction proceeds

from first to last' in a proper order, that the best I'esults are to be expected
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

such schemes should gradually be made to take the place of the short mis-

cellaneous courses of instruction, imperfect in themselves, and given to an

audience unprepared for them. The principal use of popular lectures is

undoubtedly to arouse a general interest in the subject, and to show how

much there is to be learnt on agricultural matters. Miscellaneous lectures

have thus a great value in pioneer Avork, but it must never be supposed

that they can take the place of solid, systematic instruction.

Lectures to farmei'S are undoubtedly of very considerable importance,

as they are one of the few means of improving the practice of the present

generation, but they are the most difficult of all lectures to carry on

efficiently. The lecturer must be thoroughly acquainted with farming

practice, and with the conditions which determine profit and loss, or he

will bring his science into contempt. The teaching of science as science to

an audience of farmers will soon result in an empty room ; but keen, practical

men will listen carefully to the conclusions drawn from scientific investiga-

tions when these can be shown to have a direct bearing upon their daily-

work.

One of the greatest obstacles to the teaching of scientific agriculture

in the present day, whether in schools or in evening classes or lectures, is.

the great lack of competent teachers. The best qualification which a

teacher can offer is that of graduate of one of the larger agricultural

colleges, but the supply of such men is extremely small. The qualification

sufficing for teaching the principles of agriculture under the Department

of Science and Art is an extremely low one,' and should never in itself be

Aaccepted as sufficient.  poorly qualified teacher solves all his difficulties-

by adopting a popular text-book, and teaching this in a literal mannei".

Unfortunately some of the text- books most largely used entirely fail to

represent the present condition of agricultural science, and persistently

teach a whole series of exploded errors. Technical committees should

not sanction the use of text-books of scientific agriculture which are

mere reprints of works written many years ago.

County Councils should recollect that all educational machinery re-

quires inspection. They act unadvisedly when they try to rid themselves

of trouble and responsibility by making grants to Parish Councils for tech-

nical education, and then leaving them to direct the work. It is necessary
always to ascertain how a teacher does his work. Does he illustrate his

lessons by specimens, diagrams, and experiments; or is his object simply to

cram for a written examination ? Opportunity should be given to

teachers to improve themselves by further study. Schemes for Saturday

    A' person becomes qualified to conduct a class under the Department by

answering successfully six or seven questions, selected by himself out of twelve

or fourteen, from a paper drawn up to suit the capacity of lads of fifteen. The new
regulations for the Honours examination, which come into force next year, will
provide a much higher qualification, as the successful candidates will in this case
have passed two examinations subsequent to the one just named.
  HOW SHALL AGKICULTUKE HEbT OLTAIN THE HELP OF SCIENCE? 3i7

 lectures to teachers, or classes for teachers held in the vacation months^

 are of the greatest use if good men can be secured as instructors.

    We must now speak of the relations of County Councils to agricultural

 investigation. This kind of work has been undertaken at present by
 only a few counties, and by them to a very limited extent: public opinion
 is, indeed, not nearly so developed upon the subject of investigation as it

 is on that of education. Practical investigations are, however, urgently
 required if the operations of agriculture are to be carried out in a
 scientific manner. The science of agriculture is, in fact, as yet in its
 infancy, and can be perfected only by well-arranged experiment. Thei^
 is room for an immense variety of work. Every substance which the
 farmer uses, every living organism (plant or animal) with which he is
 concerned, every operation he conducts, must be thoroughly understood if
 it is to be employed to the best advantage. Great Britain is singularly
behind other civilised countries in the work of agricultural investigation.
The reason has apparently been very simple. In most European countries,
and in the United States and Canada, the initiative has been taken by the
 Govei'nment. Ministers, having a just idea of the conditions on which
 national prosperity depends, have succeeded in obtaining public funds for
 the support of experiment stations, institutions provided with laboratories
 and skilled workers, and devoted to the elucidation of agricultural

problems. The German Empire alone has about fifty-four Versuchs-

 Stationen, without reckoning the public laboratories occupied chiefly with
the analysis of manures and seed-testing. In England agricultural
investigation has been left to private enterprise, which during the-

--present century has produced one first-class experiment station that of

--Rothamsted of which we are all rightly proud, but which is wholly

inadequate for the growing needs of the country.

     I am not at this moment advocating the immediate creation of many

first-class experiment stations, though there is ample scope for such in the-
hands of competent workers. One first-class station should certainly be
at once started under the immediate control uf a reorganised Department
of Agriculture, as without this the national investigations, which would
become one of the functions of this department, could not be carried
out. The great need at the present time is the creation of numerous,
local stations, to work upon the practical problems of each locality,
and so become centres of scientific teaching and scientific demonstra-
tion. If Parliament were to offer to give 1,000^. a year' towards the
support of a county experiment station, erected and maintained by the-
County Council, and subject to the inspection and approval of the De-
partment of Agriculture, a great start would be at once made in the right

direction.

   A few words may be said as to the kind of investigations to be-

undertaken by a local experiment station. The subjects taken up will of
course depend upon the style of farming in the neighbourhood, the object
being in every case to bring scientific knowledge and methods into actual
touch -with the farmer's work. Some of the experiments would be
carried out on selected farms, possessing soils and climates typical of
considerable areas in the county. Comparative trials of different

receives 3,000^. annually from the National Exchequer towards the maintenance of
its experiment station.

varieties of grain, root, or fodder crops upon the various soils of the

locality would be most useful.^ Fai-mers usually go on sowing the same
kind of seed, or make a change only to something that is well advertised,

without ever ascertaining by actual experiment which of the manifold

varieties in the market is best fitted for the conditions of their own soil

and climate. Other experiments could only be conducted at the experi-

ment station. It is to be hoped that comparative trials of the nutritive

value of different foods would in all cases be undertaken : on this point

our knowledge is sadly deficient.^ The chemical analysis of foods, as

conducted at the present day, is no sufficient guide to their feeding value.

We need facts as to the actual effect of different foods upon the animal,

and we must then seek to bring our methods of analysis into consonance

with these facts.

Besides actual investia;ations these local agricultural stations mifrht

be made to supply demonstrations which would be invaluable for teaching

purposes. If, however, agricultural secondary schools are established,

such demonstrations would find their most suitable home in these esta-

blishments. It will probably be desired in some cases to make the experi-

ment station a place for the analysis of manures and feeding stuffs for

the farmers round. If a special assistant is allotted to this kind of work

there can be no objection to it ; but it would be folly to allow investi-

gations to be interrupted by attention to such matters.

    At the present time the majority of the County Councils have not

made any commencement in agricultural investigations. Those councils

which have taken up the subject appear generally to have avoided any

responsibility of their own in the matter. The usual course has been

to make a grant to some agricultural college, or to some local Chamber

of Agriculture, on the understanding that they will carry on experiments

in the county. There is surely, however, no reason why a strong agri-

cultural committee should not be formed in every county by the

addition to their number of experts residing in the county. The

experiments at present carried on through the medium of agricultural

colleges and Chambers of Agriculture are almost all of one type : they

consist of the comparative trials of manures. This style of experiment

is indeed the only one which has found general favour in this country.

The fact is certainly regrettable, as it exhibits a poverty of idea on the

part of the experimenter, and a lack of apprehension of the many serious

problems which are awaiting solution.

Many important topics have been left unmentioned which will doubt-

Myless be taken up during the discussion which is to follow.  object has

been merely to give a brief sketch of the kind of national and local
work required if a real effort is to be made to give agriculture the aid

of science.

this kind.

      ON THE HIGH-LEVEL FLINT-DRIFT OF THE CHALK.                    349

--High-level Flint-drift of the Chalk. Bejwrt of the Committee, consisting

     of Sir John Evans (Chairman), Mr. B. Harrison (Secretary),
     Professor J. Prestwich, and Professor H. G. Seeley. Brawn

     up hy Mr. B. Harrison.

The Committee were appointed to investigate the nature and probable

age of the High-level Flint-drift in the face of the chalk escarpment near
Ightliam, which appears to be productive of flakes and other forms of
flint probably wrought by the hand of man.

     This patch of gravel has been preserved upon a promontory of the
chalk escarpment, at an altitude of 658 feet. It extends for some 70

yards, and attains a maximum thickness of 5J, feet.

     It is composed chiefly of sharp angular flint, varying in colour from
bluish-white to bleached-white. Accompanying this is a quantity of
deeply-stained ochreous flints, with here and there pieces of chert,

Oldbury stone, and rag.

    Flakes made by man exist in thousands, and they preponderate over

the more elaborately worked specimens. Numerous scrapers, hollow-

notched and of horse-shoe shape, were obtained, as well as partially
finished implements ; but no perfect large tools, and none with any sign

of polishing.

The worked-flint material is similar to that spread out in the Holmes-

dale valley, where it is accompanied by large somewhat rude implements.

Amongst the deep ochreous flints some bear the look characteristic of the

plateau specimens. The matrix is usually clayey, of a dark red colour,
Abut in places it is quite chalky, and unstratified.
                                                      large quantity of the

flints are encrusted with carbonate of lime. With the view of tracing

the origin of this bed attention was directed to the ground above, in

hope of finding either a Neolithic settlement, or plateau implements in

sitii. The latter having been traced to a position where an excavation

had brought them from a depth of six or seven feet (Pit A), it was decided

to dig a pit to obtain a section upon Parsonage Farm, Stanstead, by the

kind permission of the owner, Mr. Pink.

      The excavation was closely watched by Mr. W. J. Lewis Abbott, F.G.S.,

and myself, and occasional visits were made by the Rev. R. Ashington

Bullen, F.G.S , acting under direction of Professor Prestwich, Mr. F. J. C.

Spurrel, Mr. Corner, F.G.S. , and others interested in the subject.

     The following is the section (see p. 350).

    Work was commenced on October 19, 1894, by digging a pit 12 feet
by 6 across. At the top, 2^ feet consisted of a stony loam, with a large

percentage of ochreous flint, much worn, angular white flint, Tertiary
pebbles, and some evidence of southern drift. With a fairly even line of
demarcation came a grey loam containing some small fragments of flint,
a few small Tertiary pebbles, and small rudely worked stones scattered
tliroughout at places. At about 5^ feet this loam became more clayey,

and of a deep rich ochreous colour, overlying a gravel, about 12 inches in
thickness, composed of much-worn ochreous flints, some very large, and

many Tertiary pebbles. This gravel was hard and compact. From it I
secured ^ery many worked implements. Heavy rain now hindered work
by filling the pit. Measuring off 12 feet in line we began to dig another

pit,

   drift, the grey loam, with its weathei-ed pebbles and few small worked

   stones, continuing until the ochreous clayey deposit was reached which

   overlay a continuation of the gravel.

   In this pit, however, the gravel was much stained at places and

   hardened throughout by manganese. The seam of gravel proved to be

   about 12 inches in thickness, varying at places. At one spot in this pit,

   at a depth of 8 feet, a few worked stones were found lying in a sandy

   matrix ; but below this, although a depth of 26 feet was pierced, no further
   evidence of worked tools was found.

   As the object was to investigate the nature of the deposits and to

   reach the Chalk if possible, the work was continued until a depth of

   26 feet was reached when, owing to the men working in danger of a slip,
   and being so well in the Tertiaries, oi'ders were given to fill in. At 26

   feet a hop-pitcher (iron bar) was used to piei-ce about a foot more, but no

The seaboard counties of England and Wales are twenty-nine in number :

of these Cornwall has the largest amount of coast, with a curiously

indented outline of hard Palteozoic rocks ; the county of Devon stands next
with similar rocks, except on the south-eastern coast, where Secondary

rocks form the coast line, and the rate of waste is considerable. The

counties of Lancashire and Yorkshire stand next, and are margined by

Secondary rocks and Drift, and the rate of erosion is excessive. Sussex

and Kent stand next as regards length of coast-line, and are wholly

composed of more or less soft Secondary and Tertiary deposits, offering

a ready prey to the devouring waves, often increased by badly designed

works of so-called protection. The last remarks apply to the coasts of the

whole of the remaining counties of England, except Northumberland,

where Upper Palaeozoic Coal-Measures and Permians are being moderately

wasted by coast erosion, and Cumberland, where also, through the ancient

hard rocks of the Lake District being sea-margined by Coal-Measures and

Glacial Drift, very considerable coast erosion is taking place. Similarly in

Wales the hard rocks of the Cambrian Mountains are, or M'ere, margined

by terraces of soft Coal-Measures and red rocks in Flintsliire, Glamorgan-

shire, and Pembrokeshire ; and even in the western coast the sites of

terraces of Drift once present now underlie high-water mark ; a process
which would have been still more mai-ked in North Wales had not the

London and North-Western Railway run for so many miles along its base,

necessitating that company keeping out the inroads of the sea.

Your Committee was appointed in 1881, at York, at the suggestion of

the surviving Secretary, who acted as Chairman in that year, his place

being taken by Sir John Hawkshaw in 1882, who was succeeded by Mr.

R. B. Grantham between 1883 and 1889. Since 1890 Mr. W. Whitaker

Ahas been Chairman.  preliminary Report, giving the form of inquiry

adopted by the Committee and widely circulated by them, was given in

1884, and detailed Reports appeared in 1885, 1886, and 1888 : they

embodied a very large mass of facts of great value, given through the

courtesy of several public departments. No grant of money has been

made since 1887. The three Reports published were edited by the late

Mr. W. Topley, whose loss your Committee have deeply to deplore, as

doubtless his judgment would have greatly aided them in formulating

the resolutions embodied in this Report, in tiie production of whicli they

are also deprived by death of two of their former Chairmen, Sir John

Hawkshaw and Mr. Granthan;.

In the preliminary Report of your Committee in 1884 it was stated

that ' the importance of the subject referred to ' them ' for investigation

is universally admitted, and the urgent need for inquiry is apparent to

all who have any acquaintance with the changes which are in progress

around our coasts. The subject is a large one, and can only be success-
fully attacked by many observers working with a common purpose and
upon some uniform plan.' Since that date important changes have taken

place, affecting both divisions of the reference of inquiry. The success

of the British Association in initiating the investigation of the more
important subjects now being undertaken by the provincial corresponding

scientiiic societies has resulted in offers of assistance from an increasing

number of observei-s able and willing to collect facts locally all over the

United  Kingdom                                         and your  Committee are of                                                                                                   opinion that the necessity
                                                     ;

for their existence has ceased, and that the work could be successfully
carried on by local effort. The local information, however, so acquired
cannot be readily obtained for public purposes when only locally published,
and it appears to them that the corresponding societies might usefully

furnish their results annually to some department of the public service.
    Your Committee, nevertheless, consider that, valuable as would be

the results obtained locally in some districts by the local scientific

societies, there are large areas where no such societies exist, and many

where they might not care to undertake the work                                                                                                                                                                and, further,  that the
                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

work, however well carried out, is, in some cases, simply the noting of

the erosion of coasts, the destruction of churches, forts, villages, and

coastguard stations which they are powerless to prevent. They are of

opinion that the abstract of information obtained, herewith appended, is

amply sufficient to show the imperial necessity of preserving the area of

this country from the inroads of the sea in an efficient manner. It also

proves that the work of devastation is largely aided by artificial opera-

tions of two classes : Jlrst, the abstraction and selling of shingle, sand,

cement- stone, and other rocks                                                                                                                   second, by badly designed preservation

bad foundations and ill-designed                                                                                                                 slopes                              groynes of                unsuitable  material,
                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

incorrect construction, and improper direction to meet the storm-waves

at such angle as to arrest and detain the shingle brought to them.

As pointed out by Mr. Redman in 1885, the legal aspect of the case is

ably brought out in Hall's 'Essay on the Rights of the Crown to the

Sea-shore,' republished in 1875 by Mr. Loveland Loveland, of the Inner

Temple, from which it appears that the ' dominion or ownership over the

British seas, vested by law in the King, extends not only over the open

seas, but also over all creeks, arms of the seas, havens, ports, and tidal

rivers, as far as the reach of the tide,' and, further, ' is not confined to the

--of what is so inned" these, it must be admitted, are all acts likely to be

done by the owners of the soil, and they afford colour that he who does
such acts is the owner ; but these acts may be usurpations or intrusions

on the King's ownership, a,nd prima, facie are so.'
     The late Mr. R. B. Grantham, M.Inst.C.E., F.G.S., in 1888, then

--Chairman of the Committee, stated what is equally true in 1895 in the
--light of experience gained in the interval that ' the papers hitherto pre-

pared are very valuable ; but they are unconnected, and do not give the
means of enabling us to promote a system of protection in all parts of our
coasts. Tt seems essential that the information, to be practically useful,
should point out how a connected method of proceeding and operation could
be formed to prevent the wearing away of land.'

     The preservation of the coast, and the conservation of our seaboard

--counties, are matters of urgent necessity : they affect many varied inte-
--rests the Government, County Councils, Crown rights, and private owner-

ship, but as to the department which should take charge of the work, the

Committee do not oflfer any suggestion ; tliey are unanimous as to how a

working result could be most quickly obtained.

    In this report is included General Report A, ' On the South-eastern

Coast of England,' by Mr. J. B. Redman, C.E. .He points out the disasters
which inevitably follow injudicious interference with the littoral movements
of beach, and that the erosion of the soutli-east coasts by the action of wind-
waves is assisted and increased by artificial agency, by removal of material,
and by the treatment of works of defence in a selfish spirit, unaccom-
panied by concerted action, resulting in injury to adjoining frontages for
the benefit of those operated on, and he states that this is abundantly
illustrated in the records of such public departments as the Admiralty,
Woods and Forests, Office of Works, the Board of Trade, the Trinity
Corporation, and by the experience of nearly every harbour board, river
conservancy, and local drainage and sewage authority ; and he refers to
the Blue Books of the House of Commons as regards tidal harbours,
harbours of refuge, lighthouses and shipping, showing the confusion
caused by the division of local authority, and personal opposition of lords
of the manor to imperial requirements as to the conservation of the Biitish
Isles from the ravages of the wind-wave, accelerated by the wholesale

removal by ' ballastage ' for road-making and building purposes, and im-

--proper and badly conceived engineering works.
     General Report B. 'The South-eastern Coast of England,' by Colonel
E. C. Sim, R.E. (Retired). Shows severe loss of coast where public pre-
servation works are neglected, and the value of their being carried out on
scientific principles. Groynes are valuable to check movement of shingle,
and to tie the foot of sea-walls and prevent their being undermined ; an
80-foot groyne protects only 100 feet of coast ; they should be directed
towai'ds the prevailing dangerous winds, and if the coast suffers from both
south-east and south-west winds, land ties on both sides ai-e necessary, and
in all cases the groynes should be so built as to get the beach to topple

--over and accumulate on the leeward side as well as the windward.
     General Report C. ' Erosion of Sea-coast, Langney (or Langley) Point,
and Beachy Head, Sussex,' by F.W. Bourdillon,M. A., Eastbourne. Shows
that the removal of reefs of Upper Greensand rocks between tide-marks

--has caused coast erosion, and the necessity of numerous strong groynes.
     General Report D. ' The Coast of East Kent,' by G. Dowker, F.G.S.

--Sketches taken of Pegwell Bay between 1849 and 1884 show great erosion.
     Detailed Reports. 1. 'Sidmouth,' by Peter Orlando Hutchinson.
Groynes entirely failed, and an esplanade wall had to be built. Considers

the land is subsiding beneath the sea at the rate of 10 inches per 100 years.

    2. ' Lyme Regis and Charmouth,' by R. B. Grantham. This i^eport

does not refer to the destruction of the clift' between the places named, and
the fall of a churchyard at their westward end. The I'ate of erosion is
much facilitated by the removal of ' cement stones ' at the base of the

cliff.

     3. ' Axmouth to Eype,' by Horace B. Woodward. Quotes much local
information ; annual waste of cliff about 3 feet per annum in soft rock and

1 foot in hard.

     4. 'Bridport Harbour,' by H. B. Woodward. About 10,000 tons of
shingle removed away in six months, stated to be sometimes replaced in a

single tide.

     5. ' Weymouth,' by Bernard H. Woodward. Removal of shingle
now prevented groynes washed away in 1883.

                                                                       ;

     6. ' Christchurch to Poole,' by Rev. G. H. West, Bournemouth. Re-
moval of ironstone forming natural groyne has caused shingle to travel.

     7. 'Sandown Bay,' by Lieut.-Col. Garnier, R.E., Parkhurst, Isle of
Wight. States the groynes east of Sandown to protect sea-wall do not
appear to have prevented the accumulation of shingle at Yaverland.

     8. 'Brading Harbour,' by R. B. Grantham, M.Inst.C.E., E.G.S.
Half and full tide reefs have protected the coast.

     9. 'Bembriclge, &c.. Isle of Wight,' by Lieut. Norris, R.E. The

serious loss of rich land, due to pressure of land drainage of ' blue slipper,'
in the ' undercliff ; there is only one 3-inch weephole to 8 yards of wall,

                                                                                              '

which is wholly insufficient.
      10. ' Pagham,' by R. B. Grantham, M.Inst.C.E., F.G.S. Reclaimed

lands safely sustained by taking land water in tunnel through natural
shingle bank to low water on sea-front.

      11. ' Worthing to Lancing,' by R. B. Grantham, Inspector under the
Land Commissioners. Groynes 200 feet in length, 500 feet apart, set at
angle of 63° to 80° to coast line, 15 in number, supported by land ties,

cause effectual accumulation of shingle.

     12. ' Lancing to Shoreham,' by R. B. Grantham. Groynes similar to
     ON THE EROSION OF THE SEA-COASTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES. 357
I

   above, built in 1877-8, have cost nothing since, and caused great increase

     of shingle.

       13. ' Littlehampton to Brighton,' by W. E. C. Nourse, F.R.C.S. Gives

   examples of medium-sized groynes, giving good results, but extra sizes

   give no protection ; the coast generally is wasted and lowered, and many

    buildings destroyed.

        14. 'Newhaven and Seaford,' by A. E. Carey, Resident Engineer,
   Newhaven Harbour Works, Sussex. Concrete .sea-wall at Seaford, and
   the Harbour Company's wall, if united, now 1,400 yards apart, would save
   this coast for many years.

        15. ' Beachy Head to Hastings,' by Colonel E. C. Sim, R.E., Brighton.
   Points out that sea-walls at Hastings, Bexhill, Eastbourne, Newhaven,

   Brighton, Worthing, &c., have arrested erosion of sea-coasts.

        16. ' St. Leonards and Hastings,' by Richard B. Grantham. Groynes,
   120 to 200 feet long, locally protect the buildings and shore at the back

   of them.

       18. 'Deal,' by Major A. C. Hepper, R.E. At Walmer Castle an
   increase of shingle in a century. At Sandown Castle a decrease of 145

   feet between 1741 and 1859.

       19. ' Sheerness,' by Colonel Le Mesurier, Pt.E. The parish of Warden

   lias lost 220 acres in 220 years.

        20. ' Chatham and Sheerness,' by J. CiiisiroLM Gooden, Tavistock
  Square, London. Waste in the Medway estuary 157 feet in 14 years,
   at Sharpness 11 feet per annum.

       To this Report is appended a ' Chronological List of Works on the Coast-
  Changes and Shore-Deposits of England and Wales,' by W. Wiiitaker,

   B.A., F.G.S., of which 431 were received from the late Mr. Topley.
   They range from the year 1675 to 1886.

   M.Inst.C.E., F.G.S. In places 20 feet of cliff has been lost between 1880
   and 1886 ; a plan is given showing the area lost.

       2. ' Estuary of the Colne,' by John Bateman, Brightlingsea. Waste

   of 100 yards between 1832 and 1886.
        3. 'The Deben to the Colne,' by P. S. Brupf, M.Inst.C.E., Engineer

   to the Harwich Harbour Conservancy Board. Shingle diminishes where
  coast not protected by groynes. The coast is worn back on an average 50
   feet in 10 years, but occasionally double that amount.

       5. 'Aldeburgh to Cromer,' by W. Teasdell, C.E., Yarmouth.

   Gorle.ston Cliff has x'etreated from 200 to 300 feet in the past 40 years.

   Shingle entirely diminishes through artificial abstraction. Cliffs eroded

  2 yards a year when not protected by sea-walls.
       7. 'Weybourn to Palling,' by Clement Reid, H.M. Geological

  Survey. Erosion about 2 yards a year. Groynes near Eccles have stopped

   this locally.

        8. 'North-west Coast of Norfolk,' by J. S. Valentine, M.Inst.C.E.,

1. 'Sandown Castle.' In April 1857 the Secretary of State for War

communicated to the Mayor of Deal to the effect that unless adjacent

landowners to Sandown Castle joined with the Government in carrying

out Mr. Redman's scheme for preserving that coast, the Castle would be

Adismantled and no further expenditure made on it.  copy of Mr. Red-

man's report was sent to the Mayor, the coast then being worn back more

than 50 feet in four years, and he pointed out that at Walmer and the

Admiralty premises at Deal the removal of shingle is strictly forbidden,
and that this should be enforced along the length of the coast under con-
sideration. This was afterwards done for the Deal frontage, but through

no works being carried out as suggested, a recession of coast has taken
place of 150 feet in six and a quarter years.

    2. ' Sheerness Sea-Defences.' Pteport from Mr. Redman to Majoi*

Jervois, R.E. Refers to indiscriminate and injudicious removal of shingle
and material at Cheney Point, at low water, as hurtful to all interested

in the neighbouring foreshores, and even to the prospective advantage of

the owner, who, however, if this be a public injury, could be stopped in

these operations through the Woods and Forests Department. In illustra-
tion, he refers to a recent case at the mouth of the Humber, where, by the

indiscriminate removal of pebbles from Spurn Point for ballast and other
purposes, a breach ensued which resulted in a very heavy expenditure, which
might have been avoided had attention been drawn to the matter earlier.

    3. ' Eastbourne Circular Redoubt Sea-Defences,' by Mr. Redman

(1857) to Lieut.-Col. Owen, R.E. In 1805 the sea at high water was
1 20 feet seaward of the inside line of the counterscarp wall, or 250 feet
from the centre of the redoubt ; in 1808 the dimensions were 90 feet and
223 feet, showing a waste of 9 to 10 feet per annum. Surveys since that
period show a rate of only half that amount, 4^ feet per year for forty-
nine years. Encroachment on this coast and the withdrawal of shingle are
general on both sides of Beachy Head, and the defences of the Circular
Redoubt have caused it to stand out as a point in front of the retreating
coast-line, as was the case at Sandown.

    4. ' Sandown Castle.' Report from Mr. Redman to the Secretary of

State for AVar, 1860, showing that permanent works for the isolated
defence of the Castle would cost 16,000/'. Mr. Sidney Herbert (the then
Secretary of State for War) determined to abandon the Castle ; it was sold,
and proved so tough a morsel that it was only lowered barely to the ground

level. On the abutment of the drawbridge was the monogram of the great

Cecil, Earl of Burleigh, Queen Elizal)eth's Minister.

    5. 'Dover, East-Cliff Shore. H.M. War Department and the Town

Council of Dover.' Report from Mr. Redman to Lieut. -Colonel Jervois,
R.E., Deputy- Inspector of Fortifications, 1863. Recommended joint

treatment of the coast fronting Government and town property, 300 feet
and 1,100 feet respectively.

    6. ' Sheerness.' Report by Mr. Redman to Lieut. -Colonel Jervois,
R.E., 1866. Recommends that where it is inevitable that shingle be taken

for contractors' purposes for base of New Fort, it should be in short

defined lengths, and that a new length be not commenced until the sea

has begun to repair the damage.

    7. ' Isle of Grain.' Report of Mr. Redman to the Secretary of State
for War, 1867. From a plan of 1784 it appears the sea has gained on the

land 700 feet to the north of the Isle of Grain Fort.

          INFORMATION RECEIVED AND COLLECTED SINCE 1888.

                     1. Report on Coast Erosion, East Kent, 1895.

                             By George Dowker, F.G.S.

     Since the year 1884, when I reported on our coast erosion to the
Committee of the British Association, I have made no minute survey of

the coast, but having from time to time visited most part of the shores of
East Kent, I have been able to note what has taken place during the ten
 years that have elapsed.

      First, in Pegwell Bay, Isle of Thanet, there has been a continuous and
 large amount of erosion, not only from the sea having removed the talus
 of the cliff and the shore accumulations, but the cliff itself has been cut
330 KErouT-- 1895.

back at a rapid rate, more especially in the part whei'e it is mostly com-

posed of Thanet beds, at Cliff's End, Thanet. This latter station has very

much altered during the last three years, nearly all the trees that fringed

the top of the clay beds having been thrown down and washed away.

And from the clay cliffs, the chalk to Pegwell and on to Ramsgate has

witnessed many falls of more or less extent, and not only so, but all the

talus is removed. There has been no attempt at erecting groynes or other

defences along this part of the coast to stop the encroachments of the sea;

but on the conti'ary there is going on a constant carting away of stones

and sand.

At Ramsgate, both east and west of the harbour, there have been

numerous falls of cliff, more especially after the winter ; the cliff being

for the most part perpendicular and devoid of beach or talus, the waves

beat against the base of the cliff and bring down the material, loosened by

rain and frost, by the concussion.

The exit from the harbour at low water has been much interfered with

in consequence of the accumulation of sand bars at the entrance, and on

several occasions during the winter the tug was unable to take out the

lifeboat by reason of these sand banks. After a time the sand is swept

round to the north side of the harbour and is subject to frequent changes,

but in the main it continues to fill the recess made by the harbour wall

much as it did in past years.

3. The river Stour has kept shifting its channel ; in 1884 it was far

removed from the point where it found an exit for its waters to the sea

when the six-inch Ordnance map was made, and since then it has come closer

in to the shore of                              Pegwell Bay                                                    it has sand                            banks dry at each side of  it
                                                                                                            ;

at ordinary low tide, while a large expanse of shallow water is left between

it and the shore, and the shifting in the mouth of the river may have had

something to do with the rapid erosion of Pegwell Bay.

North of Ramsgate there have been numerous falls of cliff, more espe-

cially between there and Dumpton Gap ; the current sets inward from
the mouth of the harbour and impinges on the coast here. Round the

north promontory of the Isle of Thanet the changes have not been so

marked, but for the most part there is an absence of beach.

    From Margate to Birchington the sweep of the currents has been

from east to west                                                                    at  Birchington Bay the                                 groynes  ei'ected       for  defence
                                                                                  ;

liave been swept away in some places, and the shingle swept clean out of

them  in  others                                near                                     the  Coastguard                                     Station  this is most apparent.  An
                                             ;

esplanade erected near the termination of the chalk cliff some few years

ago seems rapidly being desti'oyed ; it is situated just west of a promontory

of chalk cliff at Lower Gore end in the new one-inch Ordnance map sur-

veyed in 1892, and from this point to where the close groynes are erected

at the Commissioners of Sewers' expenditure this erosion has been very-

rapid. At the latter place the sea-defences have been effectual in main-

taining   the  sea-wall                                                              to  Reculver                                            indeed, here the beach  has  somewhat
                                                                                                                                          ;

accumulated of late, and I would remark that the drift direction of the

beach has been uniformly from east to west.

    Turning now to the coast to the south, outside the Isle of Thanet, I

should observe that at Shellness Point the silting up by sand flats has

ciused an advance of the coast line since I last reported ; but generally
a'ong the shore towards Sandown Castle I can perceive little alteration,

aid, indeed, although the authorities seemed to think the sea would

speedily wash away all traces of the old castle, and so sold the materials
 ON THE EROSION OF THE SEA-COASTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES. 361

that could be ramoved for building purposes, yet in spite of this the ruins
remain, as far as I can see, just where they were ten years ago^ Beach

lines the shore here for a greater distance towards Pegwell Bay than
formerly. At the north end of Deal, towards Sandown, the authorities
have scarped the shore line and erected sea-defences by placing a timber

foot to beach and groynes and formed a promenade walk on the top. This
may have been effectual in protecting the shore, more especially as during
the last two years we have had a prevalence of north and easterly winds.

Through Deal to Walmer I can perceive but little change since my report

in 1884. I did not at that time continue any detailed survey of the coast
line beyond Walmer, but I reported generally, from cursory visits, on the

shore to Dover.

     To the north shore of Kent, between Reculver and Whitstable, I have

made several visits since 1884. Between Reculver and Heme Bay the

destruction of the cliffs has been rapid, chiefly between Bishopstone and

Heme Bay, while on the front of Heme Bay itself there has been rather

an accumulation of beach. At Whitstable the tide does not run strong in

either direction, and it remains fairly stationary.
     Between Whitstable and Sea Salter, to the west of the harbour, the

beach has continued to collect in semicircular ridges that sweep round
towards the shore, while opposite the Coastguard Station an old shore
accumulation, which has been covered by vegetation, is being gradually

--washed away, and the sea is gaining on the land rapidly.
     General Notes. Walking along the coast from Lydden Spout to
Dover last summer, in company with Captain McDakin, Mr. Webb, and
Mr. Kerr, I could but notice the change that has come over this part of
our shore line since I can remember it, and having had exceptional oppor-
tunities of many visits in connection with our East Kent Nat. Hist. Society
dating back to the year 18-58, in company with several eminent geologists,

I have ventured to give my experiences of the changes that I can re-

member. Lydden Spout flowed out from the chalk in a small waterfall,
starting from some considerable height (twenty feet above high-water mark)

above the bottom of the cliff. The talus at that time consisted of old beach,

covered with many rare wild flowers, and near to it was a series of steps in

a stone stair leading to the top of the cliff. This was on the occasion of the
visit of the members of the East Kent Nat. Hist. Society to Dover, when
a large party of ladies and gentlemen, under the guidance of Mr. H. B.
Mackeson, walked from Folkestone upper station to Copt Point, and thence

to Lydden Spout. In reference to this I should observe that the shore at

that" time consisted chiefly of beach, and it would be exceedingly difticult
for such a party of ladies and gentlemen to accomplish this journey on
foot at the present time. First, the whole of a beach formerly met with at
the bay near Copt Point, Folkestone, is entirely swept away ; at the time I
allude to it was of considerable extent, and partly cemented into a pudding
.stone by infilti-ation of water containing carbonate of lime. It was pointed
out by Mr. Mackeson that at that time the extension of the western pier
of Folkestone harbour had dejmved the fallen rocks of their supphj and

eoverhuf of shingle. In the next place, many well-known spots in the

underciiff" (called the Warren) then in existence have long since been

swept away. But what a contrast is presented by the shore at the present

time ! At Lydden Spout, where we halted the other day, the waterfall

has disappeared among a huge mass of large fragments of fallen rocks,

 vhich jut out to sea and form a most serious barrier to the advance of the
362 REPORT-- 1895.

pedestrian along the shore. The stair to the top of the cliff has long

since disappeared. Large and high boarded groynes erected to defend

the shore are entirely empty of beach stones. The old jilatform of high
beach on which we then botanised has all but disappeared, and the walk

to Dover from the shore is a work of difficulty from the constant barriers

of chalk blocks, which would of themselves form a trap for the beach, as

they had done in former yeais, had there been any beach to travel. It

appears to me that much of the fall of cliff and erosion of coast has been

brought about by the sea having removed all the beach to the west of
Dover and disposed of much of it between Shakespeare's Cliff and the

Admiralty Pier, while no fi'esh beach has arrived from the westward to

take its place.

Just in Dover Bay the beach seems to ebb and flow inward and out-

ward                         but  in  the  long  run there seems  more  abstracted  than  replaced,
                          ;

and eastward of the harbour the sea has swept away all the beach towards

the South Foreland, and many falls of cliff have taken place.

In conclusion, in my report made in 1884 I gave it as my opinion that

the beach was carried in the direction of the prevailing currents, and not,

 as is generally stated, by the prevailinr/ winds. In a note I received from

· the late Mr. W. Topley I was informed that this view was not held by

 Mr. Redman, nor by any of those contributing reports. But during the

last ten years I have met with no facts that in the least tend to throw

doubts upon the view I then expressed. The prevalence of north and

east winds does check the advance of the beach in that direction, and
when gales occur from that quarter accompanied by high tides the shifting

beaches and sands are thrown back in places ; but the effects are small
compai-ed with the carrying power of the flood tide. Off Dover and

Ramsgate the foi'ce of the flood tide greatly exceeds that of ebb. This is
shown in some observations made by E. K. Calver, Surveyor Master R.N.,

addressed to the Hydrographer of the Admiralty in January 186.3, with

accompanying tables then given, and published as correspondence between

the Society of Antiquaries and the Admiralty in reference to Ctesar's

landing-place.

It is to be noted that the beach has been travellins from south to north

between the North and South Forelands, while at the north of Kent, between
Margate and Whitstable, it travels exactly in the opposite dii^ection.

     During the last two years there has been a prejionderance of winds
from the north and east as compared with those from the south and west,
and we should have expected a corresponding change in the sea coast.

This has not been the case off Ramsgate. The sands from the Sandwich

fiats are constantly driven towards Ramsgate, and they are carried by the

flood tide north of the harbour, where they constitute the Ramsgate
sands. During the north-easterly gales they were retarded in their north-

ward course and formed bars in front of the harbour ; this, I am informed

by the harbour master, has happened again and again ; but these bars are
removed again by the natural flow of the tide to the north. North-
easterly gales setting in shore here have probably had much to do with

the excessive erosion in Pegwell Bay and in causing a deflection in the

river's mouth.

There appears to have been a constant similar motion in the direction

of the beach at Whitstable, this town being built upon a series of beaches

in parallel succession and curving towards the sea. At the present time

this is going on south of the town towards Sea Salter. Deal, on the other
 --

hand, is built on a series of beaches that run parallel to the shore. At

the latter place the first formed beach seems to have been at a lower level,
and at the north end of Deal cuts off the sea from the low marshy flat

behind. When the gasometer was put down some years ago, it was found

this marshy peaty soil was of considerable depth. The sand-hills likewise
cover some old beach.

   My visits to New Romney and Lydd beach have been few and far

between, but on the last occasion, some five years ago, I visited Lydd,

New Romney, and Dymchurch, the beach at Dungeness was still

advancing, and the ridges of shingle making semicircular curves ; while

at Romney and Dymchurch the sea was attacking the land.

    Why the beach should so accumulate at Dungeness is not apparent,

nor would prevailing winds account for it ; it is certain that the beach
travelling towards the north-eastern shores is arrested to its detriment.

I believe we must look for some other cause than the winds, such as a

change in the velocity or direction of the flood tide. It is evident from

historical data that a beach formei'ly existed between New Romney and

Hythe that protected the shore at Dymchurch. The remnant of this
beach is apparent in the neighbourhood of Hythe, the falls of which are
figured in Mr. Drew's Memoir on the Geology of Romney Marsh, surveyed
in I860.' Mr. Drew has quoted some ancient charters, notably that of
King Egbert, a.d. 833, which had been brought to his notice by Canon
Jenkins and Mr. Mackesoir in favour of a notion they entertained with
respect to the ancient river Lienen, which they supposed washed the base

of the Lynn Roman Castrum. But it will be seen that if the place called
Sartum in this charter is to be identified with the place now called
Sandton, between West Hythe and Butler's Bridge, the charter quite

contradicts their inference with regard to the River Lienen, which places,

the I'iver south of that place, not on the north of it, as the Castrum now
stands. It will be seen in reference to the Geological Survey Map of
Romney Marsh that the ridges of shingle lines which tend inwai'ds
towards Hythe and West Hythe from Dymchurch Redoubt are but the
remains of a much larger gathering of shingle which must have existed
here, and in Roman times had defended the Dymchurch marshes from

inundation.

       Survey Office, February 23, 1889.

   --General Remarks. Manj' of the stones are from the Wealden beds,

probably of the Sussex coast.

    Two may be from the Budleigh Salterton Pebble bed (6 and 43).
     One is very like Cornish Elvan (7*) ; four others may possibly be

Cornish Elvans (9,* 15,* 18,* 27*). The general aspect, however, of the
igneous rocks is not such as one would expect in Cornish rocks.

     Foreign pebbles from other parts of the Southern Coast (and also
those in the ' Drift ' at Selsea) have been referred to the rocks of Brittany,

&c., and such may also have been the origin of them.
    It must always, however, be remembered that ballast may be thrown

out of ships at the ports along the coast, and also that ships travelling in

ballast only may be wrecked, and their contents be thrown up on the

beach.

Z.--Shingle Beaches. Copy of Re^iort from Commander David Pear,
      R.X., Inspecting Commander, Folkestone District, to the Harbour

       Department, Admiralty. October 9, 1844.'

    1. The extent of shingle beach in the Folkestone district from Dover

Castle to the mouth of Rye Harbour is 35 miles. The general direction

is E.X.E. and W.S.W., but on the west side of Dungeness the coast lies

S.E. and N.W., and is the most exposed part of this district.

    2. S.W. winds are those which bring the shingle. Moderate Ijreezes

heap it up the most, and heavy gales at spring tides often form a number

of small ' fulls ' into one.

    3. It appears to come from the westward. Arises from the wearing

away of the cliffs, and travels along shore.

    4. From the westward of Beachy Head. The pebble.s, to my personal

knowledge, bear the same appearance from Dover, as far as the headland

mentioned, only they are larger at Eastbourne and Langley Fort, where

churches, houses, and walls are built of them.

    5. Gales from whatever direction, accompanied with a heavy sea,

scour the beacli                                                                                                         but it depends on  the angle at which the sea strikes the
                                                                                                                      ;

beach whether the shingle is carried onward, and a heavy sea brings down

towards low-water mark many of the small ' fulls ' formed in smootli

weather.

    6. It loses from Rye Harbour to Dungeness Point, gains from

Dungeness Point to near Dymchurch, and loses from Dymchurch to

past Dover Castle.

   A7. strip of land or rocks extends from the foot of the shingle to

low water. The tide from Rye Harbour to Dover leaves the shingle

genei'ally at three-fourths ebb, except for two miles on each side of Dunge-

ness Point. No bed of shingle has been found under the sand, but stones

are mixed with the same.

   A8. gale, followed by moderate weather, often brings up the shingle

from the lower to the upper part of the beach in a single tide to the

thickness of 3 or 4 feet.

    9. The size of the shingle on Dungeness is from that of a man's fist

to  small gravel                                                                                                         the large  ones  increase  along the  coast  west to Beachy
                                                                      ;

Head, and are smaller at Dover than at Dungeness. The weight, large

packed with small, is one hundred and fifteen pounds per cubic foot.

    10. Yes, variations exist ; the cause, abrasion in passing along the

coast.

    11. The shingle generally along the shore is only a narrow ridge,

--extending from high to near low water ; but there are at places large

deposits from Beachy Head to Dover viz. Langley Fort near Eastbourne.

Pett Level, Dungeness, and Hythe Bay. The average thickness may be

reckoned 20 feet, and their extent in all 25 square miles. At Dungeness

Point report states 70 feet as the thickness.

    12. The greatest increase is at Dungeness Point, which is G feet

annually.

    13. Cannot say respecting the Cornish bays, but in my opinion shingle

passes round headlands, across flats, and even crosses the mouths of

rivers where they join the sea.

     ' The numbers given refer to a schedule of questions, evidently by the Harbour
Department in 1844, and have no reference to those used by this Committee.
--

366 REPORT-- 1895.

14. The shingle moves westerly with gales from the eastward, and vice

versd ; the wind and gales being more frequent from west or south-west

than east makes the shingle travel in an easterly direction.

15. The distance of the ridges at Dungeness are, where most regular,

about 25 yards, and also at Hythe and Langley Point ; from Dungeness
to the gi'een fields in Denge Marsh is upwards of 2 miles. There is a

ridge extending from Dungeness east to Great Stone Point, foi'med in

a gale that occurred in November 1842, and from other small 'fulls'

forming outside of it, I do not think any future gale will obliterate it.

16. The general angle from the top of the ' full ' at spring tides to

where the  shingle meets the sand  is about  20°               but  in  smooth water,
                                                            ;

·close to the 'fulls,' the shingle often lies for 10 or 12 feet at an angle

of 45°.

17. Cannot state.

18. None to my knowledge.

19. The groynes from Dover to Beachy Head are all put down at right

angles with the shore. I cannot suggest a better direction.

     20. The longer and the higher the groyne the moi'e shingle will it
retain ; the longest and most efficient I know is that under East Cliff at
Hastings, which protects that town as far as the fish market its length

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

must be about 150 yards, and whilst the west side is of shingle, the east

side shows a vacant depth of 14 feet. The new harbour at Folkestone

may be considered as a groyne, as the ground on which part of a large

hotel and the harbour house now stand were, to my knowledge, in 1820

overflowed every tide.

     4. Notfis on the Waste at Shejjpey, hy Professor Thomas McKenny

                     Hughes, in ' Geology of the London Basin.' ^

      ' In Sheppey the most rapid waste appears to have occurred near

Warden Point, where within the memory of man the sea is said to have

cut back the cliff between 200 and 300 yards. An old soldier informed
me that he distinctly recollected that the year after the battle of Waterloo

there were houses standing as far from the church on the north-east as
those then built along the road to the west of it. I measured the distance
pointed out by him, and found it to be 220 yards.'

     'All along the cliff as far as Lane End Coastguard Station the older

inhabitants tell of farm-buildings which they recollect standing on ground
long since swept away, with perhaps 200 feet of cliff below it. It would
be idle to speculate on the average rate of waste along the whole north

coast of the island with such insufficient data, but we may well suppose
that even when Lord Shorland swam his horse out to the Nore the distance

was perceptibly less than now.'

    ' When a storm blows from the north or east a very heavy sea lashes

the north coast of Sheppey. The fallen clay and sand is removed from
the base of the cliff, and shingle heaped up along the low shore to the
west. Fresh slips in time occur, and so the whole cliff is being eaten back

very rapidly.'

   --' The manner in which this goes on is as follows : In the hot weather

the surface of the ground is cracked from the shrinking of the clay, and
the cracks are seen along the highest ground as gaping fissures, about

            ' Memoirs of the Geological Suroey, by W. Whitaker, 1872, p. 387.

6 inches across and many yards in length and depth. When the rain

falls it finds its way into these, and softens the clay at the bottom. If
the crack is near the cliff, the half-detached mass being now heavier,

owing to the addition of the water, while the cohesion of the attached
portion is lessened, slips down to the shore below, sometimes almost un-
broken, sometimes breaking off by parallel cracks into a series of terraces,
or even in part creeping down among the fallen stiffer masses as a glacier-

like mud flow. Fine examples of slickenside are seen behind the slips.

The sea washes this debris away from the base of the cliff, and the process

is repeated.'

6. First RejMrt addressed to the Committee on the Erosion of Dover Cliffs^

                  1891-92. By Captain S. Gordon McDakin.'

     The cliffs are composed of chalk, and reach an elevation of 526
feet on the west near Folkestone, and 400 feet at the South Foreland,
and extend for about six miles on each side of Dover. The coast has
been compared with the 6-inch Ordnance map of 1876. Marks at
about a height of 2 feet from the shingle or plane of marine erosion
have been jjlaced in situations attacked by the sea. These consist of
half-inch holes, three inches deep, plugged with wooden pegs, and were
disposed in a triangle for 1890, perpendicularly for 1891, and hori-

zontally for 1892, the middle being the test-hole, the others only in-
dicating their position to the eye. Such holes are less liable to be
tampered with than other marks, and could not be counterfeited with
the means likely to be at the disposal of anyone mischievously in

clined.

     The results have been recorded, and an extract is appended, from
which it appears that at the Cornhill, about two miles east of Dover, the
erosion is not more than half an inch in twelve months, and in the hard

nodular chalk almost imperceptible

     The same applies to St. Margaret's Bay.
     To the west of Dover the cliffs have suffered to a greater extent.
     From Shakespeare Cliff to the Channel Tunnel works, about a mile,
the undercliff formed of old slips has been attacked and largely removed

this winter (1891-1892).

     From the Folkestone cliffs, live miles west of Dover, the triangular
marks have disappeared. This part of the coast consists principally of
undercliff, formed by the ancient slips. The rock here is saturated with

fresh water, and the severe frosts of 1890, 1891, and 1892 have attacked
the surface to a depth of more than eighteen inches.

     Looking at a map it will be seen that the coast recedes west of Dover.

This is due to two causes ; the minor cause, the soft grey chalk which is
here at the sea level, and the major cause, the springs which issue out
at the base of the cliffs, either over the surface of the Gault or that of
the impervious Lower Chalk, and so undermine the cliffs. Sudden falls of
thousands of tons forming an undercliff, which in its turn is removed by

the sea.

   A great translation of shingle has taken place during the last ten years

from the Folkestone cliffs towai-ds the Admiralty Pier at Dover. The
numerous wooden groynes in front of the South-Eastern Station are now

buried under the shingle.

     In a similar manner the shingle carried from the front of the houses
known as the East Cliff some years previously was not replaced by
shingle from the west, owing to the Admiralty Pier intercepting it. This
is also the case still farther to the east, where a tunnel was made, about
twenty-two years ago, for the footpath that had been destroyed through
the protecting shingle beach having travelled eastwards, and not having

been replaced l)y fresh shingle from the westward. On February 23,

1891, an extensive fall of chalk took place from the clift" above Crab Bay,

about 300 yards east of the Cornhill Coastguard Station. At one o'clock

the same day a small quantity of chalk fell, and at five o'clock a huge
mass slid from the top of the clifi' with a thundering noise like the report
of an explosion, the earthquake-like shock being felt in the Coastguard
houses. The cliff at this place is 320 feet high. This fall was reported
in the ' Dover Standard ' of the same date. I passed along this clitf at
four o'clock, or scarcely an hour before the fall, which was distinctly
heard by a gentleman walking on the Admiralty Pier at Dover, two
miles and a half distant. I noticed fissures on the top, from seven feet
wide to a few inches, running S.E. fifty-five yards, and thirty yards
in length, then one parallel to the edge of the clitf for sixty-two
yards, and three others, forty-five yards, forty-one yards, and about
thirty yards, running S.W. from the parallel fissure to the edge of the
cliff. For the whole distance of 330 yards from the Coastguard Station

eastwards there is evidence of a subsidence and many minor cracks or

fi.ssures.

     This fall occurred in calm weather, the winter having been remarkably
free fi"om storms and the weather dry. There had, however, been a great
deal of snow about the middle of the previous month, with intense frost,
the ground having been frozen to a depth of eighteen inches.

     Still farther to the east at St. Margaret's Bay, about four miles and
a half from Dover, the chalk on the sea line was without perceptible
erosion. One part of the south cliff overhangs in a most threatening
manner.

                       The marks are i in. holes 3 in. deep, drilled in chalk.

7. Second and Concluding Rejmrt on the Erosion of Dover Cliffs, from Si.
    Margaret's Bay to Folkestone, a distance of about eleven miles, addressed

    to the Committee, Mag 1893. Bg Captain S. Gordon McDakin.

     The cliffs, composed of chalk, reach an elevation of 5'25 feet on tlie

west at Folkestone, and 400 feet to the east of Dover, to about 200 on

the  south  side of  St. Margaret's      Bay                     the  High  Light, South Foreland,,
                                                              ;

374 feet ; and 88 to the north of St. Margaret's Bay.

    The coast has been compared with the 6-inch Ordnance map of

1876, and marked at twenty-four principal stations and eleven inter-

mediate ones with marks at about 2 feet above the shingle on plane of

marine erosion : these marks are bore holes 3 inches deep by ^ inch wide.

This form was chosen as not so likely to be tampered with as other

marks, and because they would be difficult to imitate without a specitul

tool. Each year has a different mark.

                     1890  1891                                    1892     1893

     The hole with the circle drawn round it is the test-hole, the others are

only indicating marks.

    As in the former reports for 1890-1891,. the changes are rather those

of the undercliff than the cliffs themselves ; this applies especially to the

Folkestone Cliffs and West Cliffs, Dover.

     In last year's report the foretold likelihood of a slip has been con-

firmed by a tremendous fall from the Abbot's Cliff, which is here 450 feet

in height, amounting to many thousands of tons.
     To the east of Dover (Cornhill) stations iSTos. 5 and 6 in soft

white chalk have lost half an inch in twelve months. Stations 1, 2, 3,
and 4, in hai'der beds, particularly that of No. 4, in very hard nodular

--chalk, e.Khibit little or no erosion.
    West Cliffs, Dover. The sea has here attacked the undercliff and
talus. The marks 1, 2, 3, 4, on large detached block, have disappeared

by the block having been overturned, displaced, or buried, the actual

erosion of the surface not amounting, on an average, to more than about
half an inch in twelve months in exposed situations, and washed by every

tide. At No. 6, a large detached mass, the marks of last year (1S92)

are intact on two faces.

  --Folkestone Cliffs. Great inroads have been made on the undercliff

of the Warren in three years. The mark at Station No. 1, lost sight
of last year, was found again, even the mark .". of 1890 being intact,

although 2 and 3 have disappeared. At No. 4 last year's mark

(. . . 1892) also was intact, but 5 and 6 are lost or covered by falls of

the cliff.

  --St. Margaret's Bay, four miles east of Dover. South side of bay,

mark at Station No. 1 disappeared. Stations 2 and 3 intact, but a
soft band of chalk close to beach is here very much undercut by the sea,

so that large masses may be expected to fall. North side of bay, mark

at Station 1 of last year (. . . 1892) had been tampered with, an attempt
having been made to cut it out ; but taking the general surface and depth
of hole, the marine erosion was imperceptible. Stations 2 and 3, only
reached by storm-waves, were intact. The cliffs are here quite perpen-

                                                                                                                 BB2

dicular, and about 88 feet in height. Since the 6-inch Ordnance map

 of 1876 was published there has been no great loss of land, but several
 heavy falls of cliff, amounting to some thousands of tons, as at the Corn-
 hill Coastguard Station, two miles east of Dover, on February 23, 1891,
and the still larger one at the Abbot's Cliff Coastguard Station (Lydden

 Spout) early in the present year.
      Tlie recession of the coast line westwards from Dover to Folkestone is

no doubt caused by the uncertain foundation of underlying Gault clay,
 which retains the water passing through the porous chalk, the sea carrying
away the debris : this is particularly the case where groynes or piers at
right angles to the shore have intercepted the shingle coming from the
west, that to the eastwai'd of such obstructions gradually passing away in
that direction, and not being replaced by fresh accretions from the west.
The shore, being undefended by the shingle beach, is exposed to wave-

action.

      The Folkestone pier intercepts the shingle that at one time defended

East Wear Bay, the Folkestone Cliffs, and the West Cliffs, Dover. The

Admiralty Pier, Dover, has in like manner robbed the foreshores of the
Esplanade, Dover, and the East Cliff, Dover, of their shingle, making
costly revetements and sea-walls necessary.

                              By RicHAED F. Geantham, M.Inst.C.E.

1. Part of the coast of Hampshire, east of Christchurch, opposite Highcliffe, and the
          village of Newtown.

     a. Cliffs composed generally of a bed of sharp gravel, varying from 13 to 18 feet
           in thickness, overlying the slippery Barton clay, b, 80 to 100 feet.

3. Nearly east and west.

9. a. I have not had an opportunity of measuring tliis. d. From 3 to 4 inches.

10. I should say stationary.
13. The degradation of the cliffs is due to the water issuing from the base of the

           gravel over the slippery clay surface.

14. The face of the cliS has slipped away at a rate of 3 feet per annum, taking an

    average line of about f mile in length during the last twenty-two years. This
    is the rate as ascertained during that period, and it is probable that this has

    been the average rate for a longer period.

        The shingle beach appeared to me to be stationary ; so now tliat drains

    have been laid up the slipped slopes of the cliff to remove the water issuing

    between the gravel and clay, the slopes will become consolidated, and slipping

          will no longer take place.
15. It must he explained that the course of the channel of the river Avon formerly

         ran parallel to the beach eastwards for some distance from its mouth in
         Christchurch Harbour, but certain works executed some lime ago by some

    landowner at the mouth had the effect of diverting the course straight out to
    sea, and thus the channel parallel to the beach has become stopped. No

    doubt this is the cause of the present stationary character of the beach, for
    otherwise erosion would take place, and the slipping of the cliff further

    facilitated bj' the undermining of the toe.

                 Sussex Coast.

              By KiCHAED F. Grantham, M.Inst .C.E.

                 (I) Opposite Lancing.

1. Sussex coast, opposite Lancing. It is that portion which lies between ' Shop's

       Dam ' and the gap in the Worthing and Lancing Eoad, referred to in my

    father's returns, Nos. II and 12 in the Committee's Report, dated I88o.

2. The main features of that part of the coast are described in those returns, but I

       have, within the last two years, constructed nine groynes between Shop's Dam

    and the gap in the road, a distance of about 1,100 yards.

3.  That  is  westwards of the groynes erected under my father's  superintendence                                                                              but
                                                                                                                                                            ;

    I have had an opportunity of making a survey of that part of the coast, which

    shows exactly the rate at which the sea has been advancing opposite Lancing.

8. Partly of shingle, partly of sand foreshore. Opposite the Coastguard Station,

    west end of Lancing, chalk rocks and flints, covered with seaweed, can be seen

    at low water slightly above the level of the sand foreshore. In storms the

    flints are loosened, raised up, and washed up on the shore.

9. The shingle lies in the form of a high bank, thus :

                   Fig. 2.

w^^^^^--"" '"' "·  "" '"
                                                  '

         The base of the shingle bank is about 500 feet broad, and the top of it is
         about 6 feet above H.W.O.S.T. ; the land behind is below the level of H.W.
         Formerly, in storms, the sea washed the shingle back, encroaching further

          and further on the low-lying land. There is a ' fall ' of shingle, but this varies
         according to the state of the sea. It is generally just above H.W. springs.
11. I think that until the groynes were erected the quantity of shingle remained

          constant, but it was perpetually being driven back.

12. a, b, and c. The new groynes point south-east at a rather greater inclination

       with the shore line than those erected by my father. Their length is 300 feet,

         and the width apart is 400 feet, except the three groynes at the west end, which
         are 350 feet in length and rather closer together, d. The top end is 18 feet

        above CD. and 8 feet above H.W.O.S.T. e. Timber partly memel, partly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

          beech, f. Although they are not j-et planked up, and although there
          has been an unusual number of heavy gales duiing the past winter, 1893-94,
         they have completely arrested the encroachment of the sea, so that no damage
          has been done, nor has any shingle been swept back over the I ank. The
          groynes will be planked up in time as the shingle and sand accumulate.
13. a. No. d. No.
14. Before tl)e groynes were erected the sea had washed the shingle back, so that
         opposite the Coastguard Station at Lancing the high-water mark was at the

        date of my survey (1801) 320 feet further inland; and at a distance of

          160 yards west of Shop's Dam, 70 feet further inland than it was at the date
          of the Ordnance Survey (1875).
15. The influence of the new groynes in accumulating shingle had at first a slightly

        deteriorating effect on the accumulation at the groynes my father erected,

          but the gales of the past winter have brought up an immense quantity of
         shingle, and those groynes are now filled again.

          (2) Bdrvccn Selsea Bill and Chichester Harbour.

1. Sussex coast, between Selsea Bill and Chichester Harbour.

2. Low cliff, var3'ing from 4 to 11 feet above high water ordinary spring tides. The

cliff is composed of loamj' clay mostly, but at the west end of the bay there is

gravel and sand about 4 feet below the surface. Clay appears on the shore at

low water.

3. North-west to south-east.

4. South-west.

5. South-west. When the wind is westerly or south-west the shingle travels from

about f mile east of Chichester Harbour eastwards to Selsea Bill, and from the

^ mile east of Chichester Harbour westwards. When the wind is easterly the

shingle travels westwards from about 2 miles east of Chichester Harbour.

6. Flood tide eastwards ; ebb tide westwards.

7. (1) a. IG feet 6 inches ; b. 12 feet 6 inches. (2) Probably about 9 or 10 chains
          say 200 yards at springs, more at ver}' low springs.

8. Sand mostly. There is some mud near the cliff, opiTOsite Bracklesham Farm.

Shingle lies up against the foot of the cliff all the way.

9. a. Varies from 15 yards east to 24 yards west at ordinarj- seasons, but these

would vary in different seasons, b. High water, spring tide."*, does not quite

cover it. c. I have stated this in answer to Question 5. d. About !) inches

across every waj'. e. The shingle formed one continuous slope when I saw it,

and I should not think this varied.

10. I should say the quantity of shingle was generall}' maintained, the quantity

depending on dilierent seasons.

11. Some has been taken away for repairs of parish roads ; but this is only a small
         quantity, and the removal is now stopped.

12. A weak form of groyne has been tried botli at Thorney Farm and at Coekham

Manor. The piles at the former are still standing, but those opposite Coekham
have disappeared. They were evidently weak, and required so much repair

that they were abandoned, a. At right angles to the shore, b. and c. 'i'hey

appeared about 100 feet long, and from 80 to 100 feet apart, e. Beech

timber.

13. a. From the end of Bracklesham Lane, and from the end of Cockbush Lane.

b. and c. Repair of parish roads bj' the waywardens, d. I should say not.

14. All the way along, at a considerable rate. a. From 6 to 8 feet per annum

opposite  Bracklesham         Farm                             about  8  feet  between  Bracklesham  Farm  and
                                                            ;

Coekham Manor Farm. b. 10 to 13 feet opposite Coekham Manor Farm.

c. During the winter 1891-92 the rate must have been from 15 to 20 feet opposite
Coekham Manor Farm, from the appearance of the remains of parts of the

cliff, d. These measurements agree with a comparison of the l-inch Ordnance

map, surveyed in 1805, and the 6inch Ordnance map, surveyed in 1873.

VS. There is nothing along this line of coast to cause an accumulation of shingle, so

what is there is deposited and left to be carried on or taken away by the sea.
   ON THE EROSION OF THE SEA-COASTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES. 375

          There is, however, an increasing accumulation of shingle on the east side of
          Selsca Bill, but I have not had an opportunity of examining this.
16. None.
17. No.

19. I should arid that from opposite Marsh Farm to Thorney Farm there is low-lying

          land below the level of high water. This is partly protected by a ridge of
          shingle similar to that opposite Lancing. The sea is, however, constantly
          sweeping this ridge backwards and encroaching on the land.

               (3) Ahout 1 JUile between LittlelMmpton and Bognnr, Sussex.

1. A small portion of the English coast midway between Littlehampt on and Bognor,

           Sussex, for about one mile in length opposite the old Coastguard Station, in the
           parish of Middleton.

2. It varies from low clay cliffs from 8 to 10 feet above H.W.M. to land which is
          below the level of H.W., but protected by the accumulation of beach.

3. Generally east and west, but at the cast end of the frontage it trends rather
           towards the north.

4. South-west.

5. South-west, but the south-east wind will assist in piling up shingle when the

           groynes are placed in a certain direction, in this case pointing south-east.

6. I believe the flood tide flows eastwards until about 1| hour before H.W. It
          then turns and flows westwards.

7. (1) a. 16 feet. b. 11| feet (Admiralty Tide Tables). (2) I should say about

        400 yards, but am not quite certain.

8. The area covered by the tide near H.W.M. consists of shingle, under which is a
          yellowish loamy clay. The foreshore consists of sand overlying chalk marl.

9. a. In the general line of coast about 150 feet in breadth, but there is a bay or sudden
          bend in the coast line v.'here it measures about 270 feet, there being a large
           accumulation of shingle in this bay. to. In the general line, roughly speaking,
          about half the breadth would be above H.W.S.T., and about half below that
          level on the windward side of the old groynes, but less than that proportion
          below HW.S.T. on the leeward side owing to scour. d. The largest are
          chalk flints, and would measure about 6 to 8 inches, e. The surface of the
          shingle is formed in ' spring ' and ' neap fulls.' I took several sections of
          the surface in September, 1888, and found that they varied in height accord-
          ing to the situation. Thus in the bay the ' spring full ' is about 4 to 5 feet
          above H.W.S.T., and the ' neap full ' about level with H.W.S.T. In the
          straight line of the coast the ' spring full ' is about level with H.W.S.T., and

         the ' neap full ' about 4 feet below it. These differences may be due to the

           higher level of the planking on the groynes in the bay.

10. The shingle was being swept away in places when I first went there in September
         last owing to the defective state of the groynes, but it is now accumulating
         since I built new and more substantial groynes. I cannot say the rate.

11. The diminution was due, as I have said, to the worn-out condition of the old

            groynes.

12. a. The old groynes for the most part are at rightangles to the shore-line.
           b. I measured eight of them, and their lengths average about 240 feet each.
           c. All sorts of distances apart, but they would average about 100 feet.

         d. The old groynes have existed for many years, but I cannot say how long.
          The shingle of the 'spring full,' on the windward side of the old groynes,
          was about level with the top of the planking of the old groynes, but on the
          leeward side it is in some places 4 and 5 feet, and in others 8 feet, below the
          top of the planking, e. Timber piles and planking, i. They arrest the travel-
          ling of the shingle on the windward side, but on the leeward side, as generally

          happens in all ' right angle ' groynes, the sea scours out the shingle, and thus

      --H.W.M. encroaches nearer the land. [N.B. I have referred here to the old

          groynes, but the new groynes I have built this winter are placed in a different
          direction, viz., pointing south-east. They are of timber, but are more sub-
          stantially built than the old ones. The effect of them, which I ascribe to the

           <lirection, has been very striking, since they have been finished in accumulating

          beach and sand, both on their windward and leeward sides, so much so that
376 REPORT-- 1895.

the lower ends of the old groynes have been already nearly buried under the

sand. They are each about 250 feet long, and are placed there about 400

feet apart, so that there will be rather less than one half the original number

to maintain.

13. No.

14. a. Where there are cliffs, which I have referred to, they are gradually being worn
         back at the rate of about 4 to 5 feet per annum ; but where the land is below high

water the beach arrested by the groynes protects it. The beach, however, has

occasionally at those low points been driven back inland and covered small

parts of the estate, d. I have no data of this kind. e. No ; where there is

beach the cliff is still being worn back.

15. a. There is shingle all along the frontage I refer to, and it would in the low

places be dangerous to the land if it were swept away for any length.

b. In places where shingle has been swept away and the shore left bare it has

been entirely due to the defective state of the groynes. Where substantial

new groynes are erected they do for a time arrest the travelling of the shingle

and deprive the coast further westwards of so much  as the)' absorb                                                                                but when
                                                                                                                                                ;

the groynes fill up towards the top of their planking, although if properly

built and placed they may still continue from time to time to collect more,

the greater quantity passes on to the westwards, the remainder going to

increase the ' fulls,' and so drive the H.W.M. seawards. The result of this

action may be seen between Lancing and Shoreham, further westwards, where,
according to my measurement, owing to the groynes the beach has gained some

40 to 50 yards in breadth, driving high water so much seawards during the last

ten years.

16. No.

17. No.

18. I do not think there are any.

19. It should be observed that this part of the coast is not protected by any sea-

wall. It is dependent for its protection on the accumulation of beach ; and as

the beach can only be secured by the groynes, their proper construction and

maintenance are of course of vital importance to the landowner where the

land lies below the level of high water.

          by embanking of tidal foreshore during the past twenty years, making building
          land within sea-walls, and a further large tract occupied in gardens, and a
         marine lake protected by embankments, the present high-water mark being
          half a mile from that of 1869. to. Southport is about 1,600 yards from the

          channel left Formby, and sand began to blow, covering up the churchyard
          and streets; but, in North Meols, Jameson in 1636 describes the sandhills.
           It is probable they are of older date, as in William II. 's reign Roger de
         I'oicton gave the monks of Lancaster the tithes of ' Melis,' and that name
          would indicate sandhills, as it is still used in Iceland for sandhills, there
         made up of volcanic sand.

8. Fringing the cliffs of shingle, thence to ebb low water of sand, then of boulder

         clay, which also occur                                   under  the  shingle                                              land  water  percolating  the  latter

         flows over the surface of the clay in defined channels 10 inches deep and

           6 inches wide.

9. a. 150 feet; 300 feet in the Blackpool area. Near Lytham occurs a miniature
          chesil bank called the Double Stanner, which is steadil}"- advancing ; between

          it and the coast is a flat 600 ft. wide ; at the open end water flows through it

          from the land. b. It terminates seawards a little above neap low-water
          mark. c. North. Encaustic tiles during the storm of March 1869 travelled

        from south shore to the Gwyn in two tides a distance of a mile. d. 7 inches ;
        between neap low-water and spring low- water many erratic boulders occur,

         some 6 feet in length, e. There is generally a ' storm beach ' of very large
         pebbles from 3 to 5 feet above the ' spring full.' At Norbreck each tide

         receding leaves a succession of small ' fulls.'

10. The quantity appears to be constant, except opposite South Beach, Blackpool.

          At Fleetwood the shingle is accumulating ; it is cut off by the River Wyre.
II. Entirely due to artificial abstraction at South Beach, Blackpool.

12. a. Yes. That at Bailey's Hotel is at right angles to the centre of the curved

          sea-wall protecting that property ; the wall and the groyne were built about

        1880, and have stood very well. b. 8 feet. c. 2 feet, e. Wood battens and
        square piles. A groyne of sheet iron below Uncle Tom's Cabin was destroyed

          by the waves. Several wooden breakwaters are placed opposite South Beach,

         Blackpool, and Fleetwood ; they cause an accumulation of shingle on the

             lee-side.

13. Shingle is indiscriminately carted away at Blackpool from any part of the

         shore by (c) at a greater distance than 60 yards from the coast line; the
         underlying boulder clay is exposed by these operations, and is extensively

         denuded by the sea, which gets leverage on its surface by the tearing up by

         the waves of the large erratic boulders scattered through its mass; the large

         blocks remain, but the smaller stones are swept up the beach, which is thus

         steadily replenished. The holes left vacant by the removal of stones are oval,

          the long axis corresponding to the tide, or N.W.E.
1ft. a. Yes, especially between Blackpool and Norbreck and Bispham. The cliffs

         are 80 to 90 feet high, and consist of boulder claj% with a thick sand inter-

         vening. Some years a loss of a yard takes place. And also between Bispham

         and Rossall, where the sea-wall built by Sir Hesketh Fleetwood has been

         allowed to be destroyed, c. Shingle occurs on the face of the cliff ; the
         erosion is caused by (a) wind blowing away the sand and (J) land-springs,

         removing the base of the sand, where it rests on the lower boulder clay.

         d. There is a tradition that the cliff formerly extended to the large mass of
         consolidated sand and gravel called the ' Penny Stone,' and that a gallon of

          beer was at that period sold for a penny. There can be no doubt that it once
          forujed the base of the cliff, as the material only occurs on the surface of the
          lower boulder clay. The Penny Stone is only seen at equinoctial springs.
15. After the heavy storm of March 1869, I found all the minor beach-fulls gone,

         and the whole of the beach concentrated into one large stone beach under the

         base of the cliff, and the sand in front of Blackpool also removed, showing an

         extension surface of boulder clay froni the height of erratic boulders then

          exposed ; I infer the sand removed was 4 feet thick ; in a few tides the normal
          conditions were restored.
16. The steep banlc of shingle between Lytliam and Southshore is cerfainl_v increas-
          ing; sand blown from the shore rests on the stone beach, and forms fresh
          sandhills on the seaward side of the older one, causing a distinct gain of land;
         the large sandbank seaward, known as the ' Crusaders,' also is increasing.
17. Dunes extend from Lytham bj' St. Ann's to Southshore ; thej' rest inland on
         ))eat, along shore on shin'^le. a. Sandhills, l*. 20 to 40 feet. e. Kept down
          by bent grass, locally called ' Starr ' grass. The site of the town of Fleetwood
          was formerly occupied by sandliills, one of which has been preserved to form a
         garden, and is known as the 'Mount.' Great destruction of the coast took
          place in 1869, houses being destroyed, but this has been stepped by sea wall
         and groynes.
18. Kossall -land mark' formerly stood 100 yards further thar. at present, and
         was erected on a massive stone base, which when the sea reached it was

        removed inland of the house marked on the one-inch Ordnance Map as

          ' Kenny's.' There is no vestige of it left, though it had been twice removed

        before occupying the site shown in the Ordnance Map of 1848.

19. In the estuarine silt, near the site of the present Kossall landmark, a large

         number of Koman coins were discovered, marking the site of top, probably of
        an old Eoman military chest ; the level of the silt below the overlying blown

          sand resting on it is below the present H.W.M., pointing to the levels of land

        and sea, remaining constant since Eoman times.

           Erosion of Yorkshire Coast.

By Captain A. H. Kenney, K.E., February 1890.

     The following notes on the above subject were forwarded to the Director-General
of the Ordnance Survey, and communicated by him to the Committee :

     1. The sea is gradually encroaching on the whole line of coast from Bridlington
to Spurn Head. The foreshore is all sand, the cliffs are all clay; there are no
rocks whatever along this coast. The high tides with an in- blowing wind undermine
the cliffs, the tops of which eventually slip or fall, and the continuous action of the
.sea washes such slips or falls away. At Bridlington, Hornsea, and Withernsea sub-
stantial sea-walls and groynes have been constructed to stop further encroachment.

     2. The following measurements give in feet the actual encroachments since the
6-in. survey at definite points, from which the average encroachments on the coast
line in the different 6-in. Yorkshire sheets mentioned have been deduced, viz.

ON THE EROSION OF THE SEA-COASTS OK ENGLAND AND WALES. 383

Report by Captain C. E. Salvesen, R.E., July 1892. Communicated hy

                       the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey.

    In accordance with the Director-General's instructions, dated May 9, 18!I2,
I now forward 6-inch sheets lli3, 180, and 197, on which have been accurately
drawn from the new ttijoo pl'i^s (surveyed in 1890) the ' top of cliff 'K.W.M. O.T.,
L.W.M. O.T., extent of shingle, groynes, new beach marks and levels, and otiier

details that I consider will be useful in the question of erosion.

     All additions to the (i-inch sheets named, with the exception of L.AV.M. O.T.
(which is shown by a black line edged with blue), have been inserted in red.

     The total length of the coast lines on 6-inch sheets 163, 180, and 197 is 12 miles
.fi6 chains, and the total erosion from old top of cliff to new top of cliff is in this
distance 204-026 acres, giving an average width to the strip of coast removed of
132-5 feet. Taking the total time as forty years (6-inch sheets surveyed 18.50-52,
23'ou plans in 1890), the yearly rate of erosion comes to about 3 feet 3^ inches. The

actual areas for separate sheets are as follows, viz.

Yorkshire 6-inch sheet 163                                                                                                                                                               .    . 59147 acres "1 giving average width of strip
                                                                                                                                                                                      .

                                                                                     1«0 . . . 59-593 ,, J                                                                                                          =118-86 feet.

                                                                                                                                                                                            Total 204-026

The last result--viz., 157-67 feet-- disagrees slightly with that arrived :it bv

Captain  Kenney, R.E.                                                                but  his                                                                                            was  only the  average of  four measurements,  wlncli
                                                                                  ;

would hardly give such an accurate result.

    I have in each case calculated the area from old top of cliff to new top of ctilf
as this represents the amount of land that is or probably could be put under

cultivation.

     The average height of the cliffs in 6-inch sheets 163, 180, and 197 is 39-34 feet.
     This result has been arrived at by computing the area of an elevation (if the
coast-line made from data on the 6-inch sheets and new ;;^ sheets (B.M.'s pickets
and contours) and dividing by the total length of coast-- viz., 12 miles 5(1 ciiuius.

Multiplying the average width (132-5 feet) by average height (39-34 feet) and total

length (12 miles 56 chains), the result is 12,955,666 cubic yards of material washed
away in forty years, or an average of 25,503 cubic yards per mile per annum.

                 Report hy Captain "VV Russell, R.E., July 1892,

     I forward herewith (Yorkshire) 6-inch sheets 47, 62,77, 78, 94, 110, 111, 128.
129, and 146, on which have been shown the present high and low-water mark of
ordinary tides as obtained by the revision of the survej', and al.so any alterations in

the line of the tops of the cliffs.

     From these it will be seen that the only place where the erosion has been at all
serious is at and south of Bridlington, and also just south of Filey.

     All the rest of the coast being high cliffs, the action of the sea has been very

slight, and indeed along the greater portion there is no appreciable difference

between the old and new surveys. I also forward a report from T. C. A. Crcok, who

has been in charge of the revision of the whole of the coast from Bridlington to
Whitby, in which he replies categorically to the questions asked.

     The revision of the coast has as yet only been completed as far north as Whitbj',

and beyond that town I am not able to afford any reliable information.

    The distances between the old and new lines of the top of the cliff at various
places have been measured on the 6-inch plans, and are approximately given in feet

for purposes of comparison in the attached list.

   --1. That portion of the east coast lying between Bridlington Quay and Wliitby.
  --2. It is composed principally of rock and chalk cliffs interspersed with sandy

bays, these latter being usually bounded by cliffs of alluvial soil. The whole of
the line of clifE from Bridlington to the Humber consists of a varying cliff of
brown unstratified clay and gravel from 20 to 50 feet high, the average probably
about 25 feet. From Bridlington northwards to Speeton the cliffs are of cha!k,
forming the eastern boundary of the Yorkshire Wolds. These range in heieht from'
50 feet at Bridlington to near 400 feet at Speeton ; the average will probably be
about 200 feet. Continuing northwards from Speeton to Filey, the cliffs are formed of
boulder clay, and are of a pretty uniform height, averaging 100 feet. From Filey to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

384 REPORT-- 1895.

Scarborough the cliffs consist of Oxford clay, calcareous grit, sandstone, and lime-

stone, the whole being surmounted hj' a considerable thickness of boulder clay. (In

the two small bays Ij'ing between these points, called Gristhorpe and Cayton Bays,

the cliffs are principally of boulder clay with here and there a little shale and sand-

stone;. These cliffs are undulating and vary in several places from 100 to 200 feet

the average will probably be about 180 feet. The Scarborough Castle Rock consists

of limestone and sandstone (Dogger Oolites), and rises 240 feet above high water.

And from hence, for upwards of a mile north, the cliffs are of boulder clay, which again

clianges to rock ; but for yet another mile it is principally boulder clay with here

and there a small cliff of sandstone at the bottom, after which, continuing north-

wards to Hayburn Wyke and Peak, the cliffs rise, till at Peak they attain a height of

600 feet, and consist of shale, sandstone, and limestone, running from 100 feet at

Oloughton (where thin veins of coal were formerly worked) to GOO at Peak, the

average height probably being about 200 feet. From Peak to Robin Hood's Bay the

cliff consists of the lower lias, shale, sandstone, and boulder clay, princiiDally the

latter. Here appear for the first time the large quarries of shale from which alum

was formerly abstracted. The height ranges from 350 feet near Peak to 100 feet

at the Bay, the average being about 140. From Robin Hood's Bay to Whitby the

cliffs consist of the upper and lower lias, shales and their divisions, and sandstone.

Old jet pits are numerous in these cliff's: they are of a pretty uniform height,

averaging about 200 feet. From Whitby for about 2 miles N.W. the cliffs are of

boulder clay, with here and there a little shale and sandstone, and average about 100

feet in height.

   --3. The general line from Bridlington to within l^ mile east of Whitby is north-

--west and south-east ; from this point northwards it turns west by nor;h.
     i This depends upon the season of the year. In winter (which usually lasts six

months of the year on this coast more or less) the prevailing wind is north-easterly

and northerl}'; in summer it is south-east and by south, veering to south south-west

in the late afternoon and evening.

   --5. A north-easterly and north-westerly sea brings the highest waves ; a northerly

sea brings up the shingle, and the backsweep of the ebb with a north-easterly wind

takes it away. This will be generally correct, but the fact is there is but very

little shingle on this coast, and this only in the bays, and it would be better

described as large gravel, and would be covered three-fourths of the year by a

Amore or less thick layer of sand.  strong westerly wind off the land will cause a

sea that will lift this sand, and leave bare the beds of shingle or gravel ; but this

again is not wholly accurate as applying to all the bays, for the bays at Whitby,

Robin Hood's Bay, and Scarborough have eddies of their own that in Scarborough
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

South Bay being very strong, and due to the projecting coast line south of the town

and Filey Brigg, and deposit left in Scarborough South Bay would be caused bj- the

ebb, while in Whitby and Robin Hood's Bay it would be caused by the flood. In

Filey and Bridlington Bays there are no eddies to speak of ; the projecting Brigg at

the north of Filey Bay and Flamborough Head on the south make this a comparatively

still bay, while the large sandbank off Bridlington Quay, called, I think, the Smithies,

--and forming a long bar about 1^ mile from the shore, has the same effect here.
     6. North-west during flood and south-east during ebb, but the true current is

not reached under a mile and a half or two miles from the shore, as the contours of

the coast and the bays cause deflections from the true current.

    What is the range of the tide ?

(1) Vertical in feet.

Between 15 and 16 feet at spring and 11 at neap tides.

7.-- This varies greatly. In Bridlington Bay I should think from 230 feet at

neap to 500 feet at spring tides. Around Flamborough Head there are places where

it never leaves the cliff face, but the average would be about 70 yards at neap to

no at spring. In Filey Bay it would be about 300 feet at neap to 450 feet at

spring. At Filey Brigg, which is a reef of flat rocks, it would be greatest about 700

Afeet at neap and 900 feet at spring.  little north of Filey Brigg the water scarcely

leaves the foot of the cliffs, after which come beds of the flat rocks and shingle bays

reaching to Scarborough; these at neap will average 300 feet and 400 feet at spring.

In Scarborough South Bay it will be about 240 feet at neap to 340 feet at spring,

around the castle rock 50 feet and 70 feet. In the North Bay the average will be

350 feet at neap and 450 feet at spring; thence on to Peak the average will be

90 feet and 120 feet ; in Robin Hood's Bay 200 feet at neap and 300 feet at spring;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;;

ON THE EROSION OF THE SEA-COASTS OF ENGLAND AND WALES. 385

from Robin Hood's Bay to Whitby the average will be 120 feet to 200 feet ; in the
hay west of Whitby 200 feet at neap, 300 feet at spring.

   --8. In the bay west of Whitby it is sand nearly the whole year through, but

occasionally beds of shingle and gravel are visible ; at Robin Hood's Bay it is

sand and shingle mixed. After heavy seas most gravel will appear, but in the

summer it is mostly sand ; but this applies only from the bottom of the cliff for about

40 yards seawards; beyond this it is beds of flat rocks strewn in places with large

boulders. The Scarborough North Bay is of the same character as Robin Hood's Bay,

the South Bay is all sand, with a rim of shingle and boulders at the cliff foot 20 yards

wide ; at the south end of the bay Gristhorpe and Cayton Bays are mostly shingle

for about 30 yards from the cliff foot, and flat rocks and boulder beds beyond. Filey

liay is all sand, stretching for about 3 miles ; Bridlington Bay is all sand, excepting

about 3 miles of the north side forming the Flamborough Head projection, which is flat

rocks and boulders. Excluding- these bays, all the remaining and by far the greater

portion of this coast consi.^ts of beds of large boulders (ranging from a few hundred-

weights to several hundreds of tons) and beds of flat rock mostly strewn with

boulders, but bare in those parts where from their position the seas break over them

with violence.

   --!i. Asalready stated, there is scarcelyany shingle worth calling so on this coast

where there is, its greatest breadth would not exceed 40 yards, while the mean

·would be between 20 and 80, and this would be in all cases at the cliff foot. The

liigh-water mark of an ordinary spring tide would about equally divide it, i.e., half

would be covered and half dry. In all cases it would travel south, barring the in-

lluence which the eddy and a south-east wind may have in moving it a little north

but this rarely occurs, and is so trifling in its eft'ect as not to be worth mentioning.

It is sufficient to say that no wind that blows can take anything north betwixt the

Tyne and Flamborough Head. This is proved by the fact that portions of vessels
wrecked about the Tyne's mouth are picked up all down the coast to Flamborough

Head, but no portion of the wreckage of any vessel wrecked, say, at Flamborough Head,

Scarborough, or Whitby, has ever been found north of those points. The egg of a

goose would represent the size of the largest pebbles, and these occur at Caj'ton Bay.

--The shingle forras'one continuous slope                                                                                                                                                                                                                       there is no  ' spring full ' or ' neap full.'
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;
10. The shingle is certainly not accumulating, and on the other hand the diminu-

tion is too small to be perceptible, and the rate cannot be ascertained. From Bridling-

ton to Whitby the foreshore, wherever accessible, is the great quarrying ground for

the wants of the immediate neighbourhood, .sand, shingle, and boulders alike being

obtained as required, and this must certainly diminish the amount ; but this is pro-
bably made up again by the frequent falls of cliff which occur after heavy seas and

through springs in the cliff.

  --] 2. There are no groynes on this line of coast, with the exception of two or three

at Bridlington Quay, built for the protection of the sea-wall or promenade there.

These are built at right angles to the shore line ; their length and distance apart can

be obtained from the plans, their height ranges from about 7 feet at the shore end

--to 2 feet at the other. I have no knowledge of where they were built, and there is

no shingle at this place they are built of masonry and wood.

13.-- The material is taken indiscriminately from all the foreshore between high-

and low- water mark. The shingle and boulders are mostly taken for road and path
making, the sand for building and other purposes, and large boulders are taken for

building purposes. It is mostly taken by highway and local board authorities,
and by lords of the manor, who levy a toll upon all private individuals taking it
with their consent. No half-tide reefs are known to have ejilsted before such

removal, but it is certain that these large boulders (and at Scarborough even the reefs

of flat rocks are being quarried), shingle, and sand form a breakwater, which breaks

the violence of the waves, and consequently their removal cannot but affect the cliffs

in their neighbourhood.

   --14. The coast is being worn back along the whole line from Bridlington to

Whitby, but the greatest recession is between Bridlington and the Humber, where in
places it has receded as much as 90 yards between thepresent survey and that made forty-
three years ago, and it has been computed that 2 j-ards go annually along this line of
coast. In all the bays, Filey. Robin Hood's, Whitby, and the smaller ones (Scarborough

is in part protected by a sea-wall), where the cliffs are mostly of boulder clay, there

the recession has been most. The average width lost in these during the above period
would probably be about 20 j-ards, in places much more, in others less. After the
boulder clay the shale and sandstone cliffs, as between Peak and Whitby, appear to

be least able to withstand the onslaught-- the rate of recession here, taking the same

--period, would average 8 or 9 yards more or less. The height of the clay cliff would

be about 100 feet, with an average width from top to bottom of 60 yards. The
height of the shale cliff would be from 150 to 200 feet, with an average width from
top to bottom of 30 yards, although they are in many cases nearly perpendicular.
The chalk cliffs of Flamborougli appear to stand the influence of the sea best; the
average recession there, I should say, would not be more than 2 or I] yards during the

same period. When there are large beds of boulders at the foot of the cliff, and the

cliffs themselves are destitute of .«prings, there is scarce!}'' any difference between the

line as now surveyed at foot of cliff and that surveyed foity ^-ears ago. I know of
no data for determining the rate except the 6-iuch Ordnance Survey made about

forty years ago.

   --15. The loss is not confined to areas bare of shingle ; the amount taken is retrieved

by the amount made by falls of cliff. Tliere are no groynes for the arresting of shingle.

   --16. There is no area regained on this line of coast.
   --17. There are no dunes in th!s district. I have heard they exist at Redcar, but

have no personal knowledge of them.

   --18. I have been unable to obtain any information in this respect. I recollect

reading at Bridlington, in a local history or newspaper, the effect of the sea on that
line of coast, and I think it probable .some information might be obtained there.

     19.-- I have no remarks bearing on the subject that are not covered bj^ the
foregoing replies.

   --Sir, I beg to state that the attached report is made from my own memory and

knowledge, and from what I have heard. I have been unable to obtain any informa-

tion from any book, newspaper, or report beyond a geological map which I saw in
Scarborough Museum when there during the week, so that I cannot verify my state-

ments, but I believe they are as nearly accurate as it is possible to get in a statement
of this sort.

     The coast at both of these places is, generally speaking, low, witli sand and shingle
foreshore and no rocks.

    The amount of erosion varies so much that I have been unable to arrive at a satis-
factory average for each 6-incli sheet, but in attaclied list are given the maximum
amounts of erosion at each place, and on accompanying (5-inch sheets (21, 27, 28, 22,
:58, 37, 42, 58, 59, and 67) the present coast line is shown in red, where it differs
materially from the old, with some measurements of the extent of encroachment at
those points marked. The measurements in all cases are taken from rr^ traces,
except for Sheets 58 and 67, where the coast line was not replotted.

    I may add that the gain of land along this oast is. owing to the extensive

reclamation in the Kibble estuary and the construction of the Furness Railway, pro-
bably far greater tlian the loss occasioned by erosion. 'J'hfre is also a slight gain at
places near Barrow, due to slag from ironworks being tipped in the sea, forming
embankments.

The Committee made an application to the Royal Society for an alloca-

tion of £500 from the fund granted by the Government in aid of Scientific

Research. The Royal Society, as a preliminary to the discussion of the

application, have written to the Admiralty to inquire whether the Govern-

ment would be able to assist an expedition by putting a surveying vessel
Aat its disposal.
                   reply from the Admiralty has not yet been received.

The Connnittee ask to be reappointed with a renewal of the grant of £'10,

which had not been drawn.

YoTTR i-eporter has not received any reports from the Corresponding-
Societies since last year's meeting, but he has good reason to believe that
valuable results have been collected, and locally published. These will be
doubtless of great local value, and it is a source of satisfaction to see that
the work originated by the Committee is likely to be permanently carried
on by the local societies on the lines initiated by the British Association.
Your reporter, however, would again point out that the collection of
sections and details of water supply, by some central body, would be of

great value to engineers, contractors, and others, who have neither time

nor opportunity to seek the records of the various provincial proceedings,
and it appears desirable that it be a suggestion to the Corresponding
Societies that they annually send up the details they have obtained to the
offices of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom, 28 Jei-myn Street,,

London, where a section-book is now kept, and every facility daily given

to those seeking information.

     Your i-eporter has not received any information from any member of

the Committee during the past year, and therefore thinks it unadvisable
to do more than present this formal report, without appendices of infor-
mation personally collected by himself, as has been done on several previous;

occasions.

     This being the final Report, it may be, in conclusion, advisable to state-

that the Committee have had the same chairman and secretary during the
whole of their twenty-two years' labours, and they have arrived at the-
following general results, some of which are self-evident, but it is necessary
to state, through simple conditions, not always universally understood.

     1. The source of all water supply, whether in streams, wells, or natural
springs, is the I'ainfall falling on the area, or that adjacent to it.

     2. The quantity of water to be obtained under all three heads is that
annually falling, less the quantity evaporated, and less natural loss through

retention after natural filtration.

     3. The quantity of underground water to be obtained in sandstones-
and grits is governed lay the cubic content of the interspaces between the-
grains ; the larger the spaces, the greater facility for the storage and pas-
sage of water, coarse grits amounting to 12 inches of the annual rainfall.

     4. In calcareous rocks, as Carboniferous and Magnesian Limestones,,
oolitic calcareous rocks, and Chalk, the grains are exceedingly small, the
spaces almost microscopic, and the passage of water through the rockr
exceedingly slow, but waters so passed are naturally and eftectually
filtered. But in rocks of this class open spaces, following lines of joint,
faults, and other planes of weakness, constitute fissures and caverns,
through which water flows freely in defined channels, as on the surface,.
394 REPORT-- 1895.

and, like it, is not subject to natural filtration, and, unlike it, has not

the advantage of the purifying effect of sunlight on its passage.

    5. When porous rocks of different characters are separated by thin

beds of impermeable material, it is often possible to ol)tain several classes

of water from one well, suitable or unsuitable, as the case may be, for the

brewing of ale or stout, the dilution of spirits, or the exigencies of the
wool or the indigo dyeing trades.

     6. Where wells are pumped at the same daily rate without ajjstracting
what the late Mr. Hawksley called ' water of cistonage,' the hardness is

reduced after a year's pumping, and this remains stationary over proved

periods of forty years. If the pumps are lowered, and the apex of the

'inverted cone' be placed still deeper beneath the mean sea-level, the
width of the base of the cone is extended, and a new concentric circle of

supply is added to the contribution ground                                                                                                                                                                                           the water then hardens for a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

time, but after the soluble salts have been pumped out the degree of hard-

iiess remains constant as before.

7. Faults in porous rocks of whatever thickness, which were originally

overlaid by porous rocks, no matter how great their throw may be, are no

obstacles to the passage of underground water.

8. Where the same are, or have been before subsequent denudation,

overlaid by impermeable material, the fissure of the fault is filled with

irnpermeable material, and it forms a natural puddle trench sej^arating the

district into distinct watertight zones.

9. Where faults of the latter class exist, and tlie area on one side of

the fault joins the sea, and a quantity of water is annually abstracted,

exceeding the quantity absorbed by rainfall, the excess is derived from

the sea, a reversal of the underground current takiiig place ; and as this

goes on the rock becomes surcharged with salts, and can no longer act as
a filtering medium, and the water pumped daily approximates more and
more to the sea water from which it is derived.

10. Engineers and architects, in many cases, do not realise the danger

of placing public pumping stations where the area of supply includes
sewage farms and objectionable trade refuse. It is exceedingly desirable

that the officials of the Local Government Board should have their atten-

tion strongly drawn to this important matter.

11. This report is adopted by the Committee: they approve of the

suggestion of the reporter, that the digest of the previous reports he has

prepared be offered to the Geological Survey of England and Wales for

publication, and they recommend that, .should this offer be declined by

the Survey, the digest l)e dealt with by its author as he may find expe-

dient, and they recommend that in either case all blocks and plates used

in the previous reports be placed at the recorder's disposal for the purpose

of reprint.

  SECOND CHRONOLOGICAL LLST OF WORKS REFERRING TO UNDER-
                   GROUND WATER, ENGLAND AND WALES.

          By W. Whitaker, B.A., F.KS., F.G.S., Assoc.Inst.C.E.

     Since the publication of the list in the Thirteenth Report of the Com-
mittee, which ended with the year 1887, 37 additional titles for the years
1819 to 1887 have come to hand, of which 2 are different versions of
           THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.                    395

previous entries. Besides these, 104 titles of works published from 1888
Ato 1895 carry on the list up to the time of this final Report.
                                                                     few

titles have been kept back, the papers not having been seen to.

The writer will be glad to know of any omissions in the lists, in view

of the possibility of the whole being reprinted. He hopes, too, to keep

the work up to date. The number of entries is now 695.

   A bibliography of Mineral Waters having been made by Mr. W. H.

Dalton, the reader is referred thereto : there is no need to enter here

titles of works therein given. See Eep. Brit. Assoc, for 1888, pp. 859-

897 (1889). This list has been reprinted with a few additions.

CETIOSAURUS REMAINS.  403

--Cetiosaurus Remains. Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor

     A. H. Green (Chairman), Mr. James Parker (Secretary), the
     Earl of Ddcie, Professor E. Ray Lankester, and Professor H. G.
      Seeley, appointed to examine the Gh'ound from ivhich the Remains
     of the Cetiosaurus in the Oxford Museum were obtained, with a
      View to determining whether other parts of the same Animal remain

       in the Rock.

The Committee have to report that from unavoidable circumstances no

satisfactory conclusion has as yet been arrived at.

     During the Easter vacation, when excavations might have been made,
their Chairman, Professor A. H. Green, was prevented by illness from
taking any active part, and therefore no orders could be given for actual
operations in the way of digging. Several visits, however, have been
made to the spot and information obtained ; and, further, full permission
has been obtained from Lord Valentia, the owner of the land, to make
such excavations as are required, and co-operation from his agent has also

been promised.
     The quarry where the bones were found is in a slope facing the north,

and to the south of the spot where it has been ascertained they lay, further

excavations would be attended with much difficulty, as the ground I'ises

rapidly some 20 feet and is surmounted by a wall, on the other side of
which there is a high road, and excavations might endanger its stability.

    On the western side, where it was thought most advisable to excavate,
it was at the last moment discovered that some two or three years pre-

viously some excavations had been undertaken with the same object, but

without success, and then tilled up again. As to reopening ahd extend-

ing these, a decision cannot be come to till further particulars as to what

was done are obtained and the men found who were employed. On the

eastern side there is perhaps more chance of success, but the ground here

also has at some time been evidently much broken up.

     Meanwhile, however, the opening of a quarry about 350 yards to the
south has disclosed the circumstances that the sandy bed, which contained

the bones of the Cetiosaurus and which also contains much carbonaceous
matter, is continued in this direction. The pit where the bones were

found is on the northern edge of a promontory round which the Cherwell
river runs, and the quarry lately opened is practically on the south edge of
the same promontory. The bed is of the same thickness, namely, from 6
to 12 inches, and appears from the measurements at present taken to be
almost exactly at the same level in each spot, and in each case resting upon
some 20 feet of limestone beds belonging to the Great Oolite. Most of
these beds are very hard and more or less fossiliferous, but one or two

very soft. One soft bed, about 6 feet below this sandy parthig, is crowded
with Terebratida maxillata. This bed is found in one or two other
sections not far distant, and forms a definite datura line in the several-

sections for comparison.

     Above the sandy parting, in both the Cetiosaurus pit and the newly

opened pit, there is a bed of about 4 feet of shale, immediately followed
by the hard slabs and slaty beds of the Forest Marble.

     This 6 to 12 inch sandy bed, with the carbonaceous matter in which

the bones were found, may be certainly taken as the line of demarcation

                                                                                                            DD2

between the Great Oolite and the Forest Marble ; and though tliere is no
trace of unconformity (the beds being all practically horizontal), the
sudden change in lithological character points to a marked change of
physical circumstances, in which the sui-face, if not actually becoming dry
land, must have become nearly so, to be followed again by the shales and
the marine beds of the Forest Marble.

    This change may perhaps account for so many bones of one individual

animal being found together and compai'atively so little worn by any
movement whatever.

     Some 400 yards to the east, and about the centre of the promontory,
large quarries are open, which pass through 25 feet of the Cornbrash and

Forest Marble, apparently reaching the shales which rest on the sandy
parting referred to, as shown in the other sections. Though there is no

reason to anticipate that any of the bones of this particular animal may
have been drifted in this direction, it is thought advisable to make an
excavation or so at the place with the view of ascertaining exactly how

far the particular sandy parting is extended.
     In the uncertainty as to which was the best spot where to set the

excavations going, the Chairman felt he was not justified in drawing any
money on account of the grant of 20^. ; but now that permission has been
granted and several observations and measurements made and inquiries

set on foot, the Committee would request that the grant may be renewed,
so that the inquiries and observations may be continued, and that at the
first favourable opportunity some trial holes may be made, partly with a

view of being satisfied that no further remains of that animal exist near
the spot where the others were found, partly also of determining some-
what further than has been done the circumstances under which those
remains were deposited in that spot, and the relation of the bed in which
they occur to the Great Oolite below and the Forest Marble above.

Your Committee have the honour to report that during the past year 161

photographs have been received, thus bringing up the number registered
since the commencement of their operations to a total of 1,216. Par-
ticulars of the new additions are, as heretofore, given in this Report.

By far the greater number of these are the work of Mr. Godfrey
Bingley, of Leeds, to whom the Committee are indebted for much valuable

assistance. They desire to record their thanks to the following donors of
photographs and others who have rendered aid in various ways : Professor

     The above number comprises several duplicates, the same section or
locality having in some cases been photographed by different persons. It
was decided to record all prints received, but it will be readily understood
that in so large a number, from so many sources, a proportion of the

--prints sent in has been found, on examination, to be unsuitable either

as not coming within the scope of the collection, or, from want of defini-
tion or otlier causes, not being sufficiently good examples of features of
geological interest. It is further to be regretted that several prints have
been sent in without the needful explanatory details to show what the
photograph was intended to illustrate. It will be necessary, in arranging
the collection in its permanent location, for a careful inspection to be

made in order that prints which are found to be unsuitable may be

eliminated. The necessity for the use of a permanent process of printin
406 REPORT-- 1895.

copies fi'om negatives is seen in the fact that some of the prints

received at an early period of the collection have faded. In many

cases, too, the earlier photographs have been replaced by better prints

of the same subject. From these and other causes, the number of
photographs which have been mounted and placed in the portfolios
provided by the Committee is somewhat less than that given in the

above summary.
     The Committee have made special efforts during the year to obtain

contributions of photographs from localities not hitherto represented in
the collection, and have again issued a circular to the delegates of the
Corresponding Societies and to a large body of geologists and photographers
in the United Kingdom. All the responses which were expected have
not yet been received, owing, in great measure, to the fact that it is often
difficult (especially in those of our inland districts situated far away from
large towns) to obtain the services of a skilled photographer having
sufficient geological knowledge.

    In addition to the usual recommendations for the collection of photo-
graphs, the Committee issued a 'precis (given below) of the letters con-

taining suggestions for suitable cameras sent by several members who

were invited to state their views on this subject, as mentioned in the last
Report. It is hoped that these hints on the selection of a suitable camera

for geological field work may be useful to many geologists who desire to
have their own photographic records of scenic features or sections of

interest.

                             Apparatus for Geological Photography.

    The best camera to use is probably that to which the woi'ker is himself

most accustomed. These hints are added for the guidance of those who

have not yet adopted any particular camera.

    The camera should be as light as possible, but rigidity when set up is

absolutely necessary.

    Double swing-back and rising and falling front ai-e essentials, to allow

of correct perspective and the true rendering of lines and curves.
     The camera should admit of long extension to permit the use of lenses

of various ybci.

    It is sometimes desirable to take photographs of inclined or horizontal

rock-surfaces at distances of a few feet, for the purpose of showing minor

features, such as veins, glacial markings, structures of gneissose rocks, &c.

To effect this, two boards hinged together with some arrangement for
fixing them at the desired angle are all that are required. The lower

board must, of course, be screwed to the stand and the upper one to the

camera.

    A spirit level should be attached to or used with the camera.

    -- AIt is well to have three lenses : (1)                    rapid rectilinear doublet of 10

to  12-inch focus  (for  ^-plate  size)                     (2)  a  wide-angle  meniscus,  focal
                                                         ;

length about 6 to 7 inches, for interiors of quarries and craters ; and (3)

a long-focus lens of focal length equal to three or four times the length of

the plate, for distant hills and inaccessible cliffs.

    If only one lens is used, it should be a rapid rectilinear of about 9-inch

focal length (for | -plate size), and should be by some reputable maker. It
must be the best of its kind obtainable. Though films materially decrease

the weight to be carried, they are not recommended for general use :

plates should be used whenever possible. Good general work can be done

bromide paper. In this case it is essential that the lens should be of first-

rate make. For direct printing, the cold-bath platinotype method is
recommended as the most permanent ; it is now very ea.sy to work.

     It is advisable, when measurements are unattainable, that a ' scale
object' should be included in the photograph. (A hammer is sometimes

used, but it is not suitable.)

     The Council of the Association having approved of the recommendation

to deposit the collection of photographs at the Museum of Practical
Geology, Jermyn Street, London,' the work of arranging the photographs
preparatory to their reception at the Museum was commenced. It was
expected that the collection would be deposited in its permanent home

early in the present year ; but the work of mounting and arranging was
unavoidably delayed, and when this could be i^roceeded with, the Secretary
found himself unable, through unexpected calls upon his time, to undertake
the necessary supervision and to complete the work at the date originally
intended. These unforeseen difficulties have now, however, been over-
come, and the first portion of the collection, consisting of five portfolios
and fourteen cases, containing some 886 photographs (as given in the
Schedule, Appendix I.), has now been delivered at Jermyn Street. The

remainder will be completed and forwarded to the Museum as soon as

possible after the conclusion of the meeting at Ipswich.
     The Committee desire to record their deep sense of the loss sustained

through the death of their esteemed colleague. Professor Valentine Ball,
C.B., F.R.S., whose active and valuable assistance in furthering the
objects of the Committee was most highly appreciated.

    Now that the collection of geological photographs has found a

permanent home, where, in due time, it will be accessible to the public,
the Committee are desirous of pushing their work forward as rapidly as

possible. There is still, however, much to be done before the collection

can be said to be truly representative, in a pictorial sense, of the leading
outlines of British geology. Important sections are being frequently
opened, of which it is often useful to preserve photographic record, and the
large area from which no photographs have yet been sent in points to the
desirability of the continuance of systematic effort to obtain a more
complete series of geological illustrations.

     It is, moreover, felt that the value and utility of the collection would
be greatly increased by the publication of a supplementary catalogue
having a geological arrangement. Should the Committee be reappointed
for another year, it is not desired to apply this year for a renewal of the

grant.

aflBx the registered numbers, as given below, to their negatives for con-
venience of future reference.

     Copies of photographs desired can, in most instances, be obtained
either from the photographer direct or from the officers of the local
society under whose auspices the views were taken.

    The price at which copies may be obtained depends upon the size of

the print and local circumstances, over which the Committee have no

control.

     The Committee find it necessary to reiterate the fact that they do not
assume the copyright of any photographs included in this list. Inquiries
respecting them, and applications for permission to reproduce photographs,
should 7iot be addressed to the Committee, but to the photographer direct.

Schedule of the collection of Photographs of Geological Interest, as arranged by the
     Cojnmittee appointed by the British Association, forwarded {in accordance with
     a resolution of the Council) to the Director-General of the Geological Survey, to

    be deposited in the Museum of Practical Geology, 28 Jermyn Street, London.

    Arrangement of the Collection of Geological Photographs.

  --Note. The Committee .appointed to undertake the ' collection, pre-

servation, and systematic registration of photographs of geological interest

in the United Kingdom ' began its operations in 1889. During the first
two years prints were received mounted on cards without restriction as to
size. Afterwards, to secure uniformity, a standard mount was adopted,
with perforated edges for binding in cases (size 15^ x 12 inches). It was

not found practicable to transfer the early portion of the collection to the
standard-sized mounts in cases. The arrangement of this portion has

therefore had to be made in portfolios, boxes and cases of various sizes.

When the size is not stated it will be understood that the cases consist of

--the standard-sized mounts, measuring 15| x 12 inches.
     Inventory. The following are on irregular sized mounts, dimen-
sions of the largest mounts being gi\-en below :

--Stonesfield Slate. Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr.

    H. B. Woodward (Chairman), Mr. E. A. Walford (Secretary),
     Professor A. H. Green, Dr. H. Woodward, and Mr. J. Windoes,

      appointed to open further sections in the neighhourhood of Stonesfield
      in order to show the relationship of the Stonesfield slate to the under-

     lying a,nd overlying strata. (Drawn up hy Mr. Edwin A. Walford,

       Secretary.)

The shaft sunk by the Committee in 1894 was reported by the work-
men to be unsafe, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to find the old
sinking of 1830 at Peed Hill, near Stonesfield, reported upon by Professor
Ed. Hull. The work was ultimately continued upon the Stocky Bank
shaft to a depth of 60 feet. At that depth it had penetrated 13 feet into

--one of the highest beds of the Inferior Oolite the Clypeus-Grit (zone

Ammonites Parkinsoni). It has proved the continuance not only of the
compact barren limestones (sub-Bathonian) so well developed around
Chipping Norton, but also of the sandy limestone beds between them and

the Glypeus-Grit.

     The section, as before stated, has been made by scarping a bank for about
30 feet, and by sinking a shaft to a depth of 60 feet on the step of the

bank. It is practically a continuous section, only 2 or 3 feet intervening,
laterally, between the ending of the one cut and the beginning of the

other.

                (About 12 feet of stone can be made out below.)

     Whether beds 16 to 26 are in their proper place is open to doubt.
They contain fossils (excepting corals) similar to those found in the
railway cutting at Ashford Bridge, barely a mile distant, and the clay

courses are alike. Many authors report the slate to underlie the carbo-

naceous clays and coi-al bed in the Ashford Bridge cutting. The Stocky
Bank is much faulted.

     In the open section at Reed Hill, as described by Mr. H. B. Woodward,
the slate is covered by 5 feet of marls with Modiola gibbosa, Rhynchonella
concinna, and Ostrea Sowerbyi. In the Stocky Bank section, in the near
shafts, and in other open workings, the succession of strata is the same.

     In order to consider more fully the true position of the beds 16 to 26
and to study relative sections and their fossil contents, your Committee
would defer the final report until 1896.

--Tlie Fossil Plujllopoda of the Palceozoic Bochs.- Ttrelfth Report of the

     Committee, consisting of Professor T. Wiltshire {Chairman^, Dr.

     H. Woodward, and Professor T. Rupert Jones (Secretary).
     {Brawn up hy Professor T. Rupert Jones.)

A1§. SHORT provisional list of the Silurian Peltate Phyllopods was appended

to our Report (the Tenth) for 1893 ; but since then a complete catalogue
of the Lower Palaeozoic Phyllopoda (Phyllocarida), with their geological

horizons, their range and localities, has been made with the obliging help
of Dr. C. Lapworth, F.R.S. This is now produced in four tables, as it
greatly enhances the value of our Reports on these fossils, and will be
of considerable use to paleontologists both at home and abroad.

         Note by Professor C. Lapworth, LL.D., F.H.S., F.G.S.

    The fossils named in the preceding list are confined to the so-called
Lower Palaeozoic Rocks, constituting the original ' Silurian System ' of

Murchison and Barrande, and variously classified by geologists at the

present day. All are agreed, however, that they contain three distinct

faunas, namely, the ' First, Second, and Third Faunas ' of Barrande ; but
the three distinct series of strata containing these three faunas are vari-

ously grouped by diSerent authorities. The French geologists still retain

in principle the nomenclature of Barrande, and regard these three rock

groups as the three component divisions of the Silurian system, namely,

Silurien In/erieur or Primordial, Silurien Moyen, and Sihtrien Superieur.

    The plan adopted in the present notice is to regard each of these three

rock series as constituting in itself a distinct system, namely, (A) Cam-

brian, or the System of the First Fauna (B) Ordovician, or the System
                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

of  the  Second  Fauna                             and (C)  Silurian (or  Salojnan),  or the  System of
                                                ;

the Third Fauna.

    In the following table the various schemes of nomenclature lying

between the two extreme types are given for the sake of reference and

comparison, and the several formations which have hitherto yielded fossil

Phyllopoda (Phyllocarida) are arranged in their natural positions in the

general scale of sequence.

Palseozoic Phyllopoda since the last (Eleventh) Report in 1894.
     1. Professor Dr. Gustav Lindstrom, palaeontologist in the State

Museum of Sweden, has discovered and courteously sent to us specimens
of a new Emmelozoe, not far removed in shape and features from

E. elliptica (M'Coy). Several very definite individuals, with delicate,
thin, shining carapace- valves, light brown, and somewhat iridescent, occur

                                       [Read at Oxford, 1894.]

The investigations of the Committee during the past year have yielded

results of more than ordinary interest, though the amount of information
to be embodied in their report is less than has been available during the
previous two or three years.

   A hope was expressed in the twenty-first Report that, as the result of

an appeal made to the Corresponding Societies, information would be
forthcoming regarding the Erratic Blocks of districts fiom which hitherto
no returns had been sent in. This expectation has been realised ; and
the Committee, for the first time in their history, are now enabled to j ustify

the reference to Ireland in the terms of their appointment. In response to
the circular issued by this Committee to the Corresponding Societies, the
Belfast Naturalists' Field Club promptly organised a committee to inves-
tigate the Erratic Blocks of the north-east of Ireland ; and the first

report, drawn up by the Honorary Secretary, Miss Sydney M. Thompson,
and printed in the Proceedings of the Club (1893-94), is a valuable
record of minute painstaking and accurate investigation. The Com-
mittee have not limited their work to merely recording the erratics,
but have made a complete study of the Drift deposits, and their organic
and other contents, at several selected exposures, and have trans-
mitted to this Committee a series of twenty photographs illustrating the

features described. Lincolnshire is also added to the list of English

counties coming within the sphere of the actual operations of the Com-
ox THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND. 427

mittee, and it is matter for congratulation that two observers have under-

taken the work of recording the erratics of that county Two very im-

portant pieces cf work have been undertaken by the Yorkshire Boulder

Committee, one in the western portion of the area coming within their

purview, near Barnsley, and the other, by the aid of the East Riding

Boulder Committee, organised under the secretaryship of Mr. J. W.

Stather, F.G.S., by the Hull Geological Society, in the country round

Hull. In the latter case an exhaustive survey has been undertaken of

all the erratics at present visible in the area selected, the one-inch map

being divided into squares, and each square allotted to a worker, who will

record every erratic above ground. The value of such a survey, in the

elucidation of tlie complex problems of glacial geology, can hardly be

over-estimated.

     The Barnsley reports refer to a series of erratics, some of which were ob-
served many years ago, but only a few of which were recorded. Fortunately,

a local worker, Mr. W. Hemingway, preserved the information left in his

hands by Professor A. H. Green, and supplemented it largely by his own

observations. Mr. T. Tate, Secretary of the Yorkshire Boulder Committee,

and the present writer, went over much of the ground under Mr. Heming-

way's guidance, and can thus corroborate his testimony on many important

points ; though a very large proportion of the erratics, especially such as

were of a hard nature, have disappeared under the hammer of the road-

mender. (It would be well here to remark that a like fate is rapidly

overtaking many of the most interesting and significant of the ice-borne

boulders in the country, and to reiterate the oft-repeated appeal to local

--observers to take prompt measures to record and, if possible, to preserve
--the erratics which come under their notice.) The especial interest of

the groups observed lies in the fact that they are quite detached from the

main lines of transport, and are so placed that they conceivably may

--have come by either of three routes viz, : ( 1 ) with the train of erratics,

exclusively from the Lake District, which is traceable down Calderdale to

within a few miles of  Royston  and  Barnsley                                 (2) with  the  dispersion of
                                                                           ;

Brockram, Shap granite, and other Lake District rocks, with a few

Scottish rocks, which can be traced down Teesdale and the Vale of York
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

or (3) with the coast dispersion characterised by a similar series to that

of the Vale of York, with some Scandinavian and other crystalline rocks

superadded. The abundance of rocks from the northeni part of the
Lake District is conclusive against (1), while the occurrence of crystalline
rocks, red and grey granites, gneissose granites, and felspar porphyries,

certainly coming from neither English nor South Scottish sources, seems

equally against (2), leaving the third the probable direction of origin.

Mr. Tate recognised a Norwegian aspect of the non-British rocks.

of the dispersion of boulders from six small bosses of syenite which crop

out about Sapcote, near Leicester,

The Committee have again to report that the work of recording the ice-
borne erratics of Great Britain and Ireland has made satisfactory pi'ogress,

and that several districts, regarding which no information was previously
obtainable, have been reported upon.

     The Yorkshire Boulder Committee, acting in conjunction with the
sub-committee appointed by the Hull Geological Society, have presented

another valuable report. Further details are furnished relating to the re-
markable series of erratics found in the Yorkshire Calder ; but the most
notewoi-thy contribution is a tabulated list of no less than 2,070 boulders,
comprising the lohole of those visible i7i situ in the cliffs or lying on the
shore above ' half -tide,' along a length of fourteen miles of coast of

--Holderness from Withernsea to Hornsea a truly admirable piece of ob-

servation.

     Several records are given of the occurrence of Scandinavian erratics at

inland stations in Holderness. Other reports received from the same
source deal with sporadic boulders in other parts of Yorkshire.

    The Rev. W. Tuckwell, of Great Grimsby, has added to the list of

erratics noted in Lincolnshire, and is taking active measures to secure the
co-operation in the work of the clergy of the district.

    New ground has been broken in the county of Northumberland, with

I. The above is a rough classification of 2,070 boulders (above a foot

in diameter) noted on the Holderness coast between Withernsea and

Hornsea, a distance of 14 miles, during the summer of 1895.

AH HII.

the above table were in situ in the clay, or were close to the boulder clay

cliff from which they were recently fallen. In section F, however, a

large group of boulders occurred at about ' half-tide,' and these are in-

cluded in the table.

III. Table I. gives the actual number of boulders noted in the different

sections of coast.

     Table II. gives the percentage of the different classes of the rocks.

     IV. The largest boulder seen was a block of Carboniferous limestone

on the beach near Mappleton (85 inches x 31 inches x 30 inches +).
Many others approach this size.

   A block of garnetiferous schist was noted at base of cliff near Cowden,

22 inches x 30 inches x 13 inches.

resemblance to the pre-Cambrian rocks of Pembrokeshire; 2 or 3 acid

rocks, brecciated felsites, and tuffs were very like Carnarvonshire rocks,

especially those of the Lleyn promontory. None was recognised as

belonging to the volcanic rocks of the neighbourhood of Fishguard, of

Mid Wales, or of any place further north than Carnarvonshire.

From these data it is concluded that the movement of transport was from

the west or north-west.

Some were of such a general character that it was impossible to locate them.

ON THE DIP OF THE UNDERGROUND PALEOZOIC ROCKS. 411

On the Dbjp of the Underground Palceozoic Rocks at Ware and Clieshunt.
                      By Joseph Francis, M. Inst., G.E.

           [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.j

It has come to my knowledge that some of the geologists specially

interested in ascertaining the lie of the ancient rocks beneath the Eastern

Counties of England, are doubtful whether any value is to be attached to
statements that have been made with regard to the dip of these rocks

at certain places. I refer especially to two instances in which borings

were made into the strata underlying the Gault to the north of London,

and where much time and money were spent in obtaining the true angles

and directions of dip. It was in the year 1879 that these observations

were made, but it does not appear that any description of the methods
adopted has hitherto been published, and Mr. Whitaker has suggested

that I should give a short account of the experiments that were carried

out by me under the direction of the late Mr. James Muir, the former
engineer to the New River Company. This I now propose to do, and
hope to be able to show that the recorded results may be accepted as

perfectly reliable.

    These borings were undertaken by the New River Company on the advice

of geologists who were of opinion that the Lower Green Sand extended to

the outskirts of London, and that when found, it could be relied upon to
afford a plentiful supply of pure water for the use of the metropolis. The

outcrop of the Lower Green Sand to the north of London extends from

Leighton Buzzard to Ely, over an area of 166 square miles, and con-

sequently  must  receive  on  its  surface  an  immense  quantity  of  rain  water
                                                                                                      ;

moreover, being extremely pervious, it must be capable of transmitting

through its mass a large percentage of the rainfall. Nearly forty years

before this, a good yield had been obtained from the same formation, at a

depth of 1,800 feet, at Grenelle, near Paris, and later on at Passy,

Ain the same neighbourhood.        deep bore at Kentish Town, made in

the year 1855, had revealed the fact that a ridge, if nothing more, of

ancient rocks protruded upwards to the Gault, and this discovery raised

considerable doubt as to the extent of the sandy layer under ground.

There was also a great amount of uncertainty as to whether this stratum,

which is so prolific of water when tapped anywhere near its outcrop,

would yield equally well where compressed by the Aveight of a thousand

feet or more of superincumbent earth. On the other hand, the Royal

Commission on Water Supply, which sat in 1869, had reported that 'so

far as this Green Sand continued, it would form a valuable and copious

water-bearing bed,' and it was felt that the problem was one of such

extreme importance that it was of the utmost consequence it should
be solved. The water supply, which there was a chance of so gaining, was

so convenient and good as to justify some amount of speculation in

endeavouring to obtain it, whilst there was, in any case, a certainty of a

large accession of Chalk water from the upper part of the bore. I may
here remark that, although several eminent men decidedly encouraged the

venture, they can hardly be held responsible for the extravagant notions

entertained by some persons, who assumed that this experiment was about

to solve the whole question of the future supply of water to London.
--442 REPORT 1895.

One of the borings to which I wish to call attention was made at Ware,

and the other at Turnford, near Cheshunt, both in the county of Hertford.

These particular places were chosen because they offered suitable sites for

new Chalk wells, and because land alongside the channel of the New

River was available for pumping stations. On reaching certain depths,

the bore holes furnished conclusive evidence that it was quite hopeless to

expect a supply of water from below the Gault, and orders were about to

be given for a cessation of the work, when those geologists who had

watched the progress of the enterprise, expressed a wish that endeavours

might be made to learn the direction of the dip of the lowest stratum

reached in each case. Instructions were thereupon given for the requisite

investigation to be made, and when the inquiry was found to involve

additional boring, the construction of special apparatus, and the devotion

of much time and attention, these were liberally provided by the New
ARiver Company.
                 number of men of science formed themselves into a

Committee to advise as to the best way of obtaining the desired informa-

tion. This Committee consisted of Sir William Thomson, now Lord

Kelvin, Dr. C. W. Siemens, Mr. Etheridge, Professors T. McK. Hughes,

Maxwell, and Stokes, Mr. Mylne, and Mr. Muir.

From time to time they discussed various modes of proceeding, and

under their advice the several experiments were arranged. In carrying

out their suggestions, every possible care was exercised to ensure correct

results, and observations were repeated until there could be no reasonable

doubt of the truth of the conclusions arrived at.

Before describing in detail the appliances used, I may give a general

outline of the circumstances preceding the discovery of Silurian Rock at

the Ware boring, and of Devonian at Turnford.

Before the year 1872, a well had been sunk into the Chalk at Turnford,

and pumping engines erected. The shaft had a depth of 176 feet, with

a bore hole 34 inches in diameter, extending to a depth of 362 feet from

the surface of the ground. The bore was made of this large size in order

to admit of its being continued downwards to a great depth without

undue contraction of diameter, in case it should be afterwards decided to

search for the Lower Green Sand                                                                                                                               but  it was not until  187-i that it  was
                                                                                                                                                           ;

resolved to follow up the question. Arrangements were then made for

deepening the bore and for dealing with any water that might be obtained

from the hoped-for deep source. To convey the expected supply of water

to the surface, a wrought iron tube of 24 inches internal diameter, and

long enough to reach to the bottom of the hole, was provided. Its joints

were made quite watertight throughout by calking, and all access of

water from a higher level was to be shut off by sealing up an annular

space to be left around the tube where it passed through the Gault

clay. The sinking of this tube to a depth of 896 feet, was accom-

plished by the old system of breaking up tlie material with chisels and

bringing it to the surface by means of buckets with valves in the bottom.

In the meantime, the more rapid method of rock -boring by means of

diamonds had become a success, and, after due consideration, it was

decided to put down a hole by this meajis at another spot in order to

Aobtain an early solution of the question.                                                                                                                         site near Ware, six miles

north of Turnford, was selected, and in the beginning of the year 1878 a

boring by the new process was commenced there. By this method, a number

of black diamonds fixed in one end of a ring or short tube of steel, techni-

cally called a 'crown ' (fig. 1), are caused to rotate against the rock to be

drilled, and the diamonds, being harder than any other known substance,

cut their way through, forming an annular groove which becomes deeper

Aand deeper as the crown is slowly lowered.  cylindrical core of un-

detached rock is thus left standing in the middle (tig. 2), and is received in a

long tube of a somewhat greater internal diameter than the crown which

it surmounts. To the closed top of this core-tube is attached a column

of tubular rods, by which a I'apid rotary motion is transmitted from

machinery above, and down which water is pumped, with the double

purpose of keeping the drill cool and of bringing up the abraded material.

To admit of the passage of the water from the inside to the outside of the

crown, grooves are formed across the cutting face, and through these the

water is forced, carrying with it the debris cut away by the diamonds.

The water then passes upward outside the core- tube to the top of the

hole, bringing with it the lighter of the particles. Above the core-tube,

and enclosing the lower end of the suspending rods (fig. 3), there is an open

topped tube of a few feet in length, into which the heavier matter falls,

and this sediment tube is emptied when the crown is raised to the surface.

Before the core can be brought up from the bottom it must be detached

from its bed. This is usually effected by friction during the revolution of

the crown in boring, the inner surface grasping the core with sufficient
force to break it off. The block then falls out of the perpendicular, and
when the boring-rods are drawn up, it is generally found with its lower
end resting on the intei-nal shoulder of the crown. Most frequently, the
fracture occurs at a bed or other joint in the rock. Should the pillar
remain firmly fixed after it has attained the full height of the core-tube,
one of the various appliances known as core-extractors is lowered. This
firmly clips the core at the bottom, and on the application of adequate
lifting power to the rods, the piece is broken oflT and can be withdrawn.
In this way, solid columns, 30 feet in length, and 16 inches in diameter,
were obtained.

     The great advantage of the system is, that substantial specimens of the
materials bored through can be obtained, and their relative positions

actually seen. No room is left for doubt as to the depths and thicknesses

of the various strata, and since the hole is put down perfectly vertical,
there is no difficulty in ascertaining the exact angle of the dip if it is

steep enough to be appreciable in the core. On the other hand, the rota-

tion of the apparatus precludes all knowledge of the direction of dip by
mere inspection, and special means have to be devised for ascertaining this

particular.

--444 REPORT 1895.

Returning now to my narrative of events. When it was decided, in

1878, to put down a test hole at Ware, it was anticipated that the Gault

there would have been passed through before the Turnford boring had pro-

                       gressed very much beyond its then depth of 836

[Fig. 3.               feet, in which case the latter could have been dis-

                       continued if the Ware site proved unfavourable

-JjCTWff rods          for it was obvious that if the Lower Green Sand
                       did not yield water at the more northerly of the

                       two points, it would not do so at the other, which

                       was so much farther from the outcrop. But delays

                       occurred. Soon after starting, the boring-rods broke

                       in consequence of a fall of gravel from above ; the
                       core-tube and a core- extractor were dropped to

"Sedwieru. (zd>e/      the bottom, and the guide-pipe at the top was
                       carried away. This necessitated the sinking of

                       cast-iron cylinders, 6 feet in diameter, to a depth

                       of 30 feet from the surface, by means of compressed

                       air a work that occupied some time. Later on, a

                       rod became bent near the bottom of the hole at a

                       depth of 780 feet, and much time was lost in re-

                       covering the crown and tubing which were set fast

                       by this accident. Thus the work occupied much

                       more time than had been expected, whilst at the

                       Turnford boring, the contractors (Messrs. Docwi'a

                       & Son), after reaching a depth of 896 feet, adopted

                       the diamond drill, and in this way hastened the

                       completion of their work. Whereas the boring by

                       chisels had been proceeding through the Gault clay

                       at an average rate of about 2 feet in depth per

                       week, by the new process an advance of 18 feet or

CcT^tujbe'             more was made in the same time. Thvis it even-
                       tually happened that the Gault was pierced through

                       at both places at about the same time.

                            Shortly before this, a boring made at Crossness
                       for the late Metropolitan Board of Works had

                       shown that there was no Lower Green Sand in that

                       locality ; whilst at Tottenham Court Road, Messrs.

                       Meux had bored through 64 feet of what was at the

                       time erroneously supposed to be Lower Green Sand,

                       and had found it to be a comparatively compact

                       stone, containing but little water. These facts were

                       discouraging, but they still left room for hope that

                       the thinning-out of the water-bearing stratum was

                       confined to the deepest part of the London basin.

                       The results of the New River Company's borings

                       were, therefore, looked for with great interest, and

Scale, 1 in. to 8 ft.  depth of 796^ feet at Ware, and, a month later,

                       Devonian was found at a depth of 980| feet at

Turnford, those who took a scientific interest in the question, naturally

tried to secure all the information obtainable under these exceptionally

favourable circumstances. Hence the demand for a special inquiry as to

the direction of the dip of these rocks.

ON THE DIP OF THE UiNDERGROUND PALAEOZOIC UOCKS. 445

    At neither place was there any Lower Green Sand, although in each

case the occurrence of a dark -coloured sand, several inches in depth, above
the Palseozoic Rocks gave rise to the belief that the stratum was repre-

sented in an attenuated form. Recent investigation by Mr. W. Whitaker

and Mr. A. J. Jukes-Browne has, however, shown that this was merely
the basement bed of the Gault, whilst the 64 feet of rock occurring
between the Gault and the Old Red Sandstone at Messrs. Meux's well, has
been declared by the same authorities to belong to the Jurassic system.

    I will now proceed to describe the various appliances, either suggested
or used, for obtaining the desired information, and the manner in which

the experiments were conducted.

    The first idea that occurred was, to make use of a magnetic needle.

that was still affixed to its base, and when it had come to rest in its
natural position, it would either be secured immovably to the core, or its
impress stamped in some way upon the top. If a sufficiently long piece
of core were then broken off and brought up, the angle between the line
of dip and the magnetic meridian of the day could be directly read off
the specimen by means of a protractor. For fixing the needle in position
when arrived at the bottom, various devices were suggested, including,

amongst others, its enclosure in a pressure-tight box, so arranged as to be

capable of becoming firmly attached to the core when lowered over it. In

                                       arranging an instrument that

would be likely to work satisfactorily on these lines. The risk of disturb-

ing the needle duiing the descent of a weight or the inflow of a liquid was

very great ; but the principal objection was, that the tubes to which the
ON THE DIP OF THE UNDERGROUND PALEOZOIC ROCKS.                                  447

apparatus must be connected were t)f steel, and would in all probability

so disturb the movements of the magnet as to lead to erroneous conclu-

sions. So also, masses of iron in the earth might cause deflection, whilst

there would be nothing to indicate that such had occurred. The idea of

attempting to trace the magnetic meridian on the rock was consequently

abandoned, and it was next considered how the core, or a cast of it, could
be marked with some other known line of direction. To do this, the

carrier of the marking apparatus, or of the plastic material, must be

placed over the centre of the hole, with a horizontal line, the bearing of

which is known, marked upon it. It must then be lowered to the bottom

and made to operate without receiving the slightest permanent twist

during any part of the movement. This maintenance of a marked

diameter always in the same azimuth was the most difficult requirement

to fulfil. The earliest proposal was, to stretch a pair of fine steel wires verti-

cally between a core tube (fig. 6), used as a marking frame, and the top of

the boring stage, at .30 feet above ground. These wires were to be on

opposite sides of the axis of the boring-rods and at equal distances there-

I from, but no nearer to each other than was necessary for clearing the
    sides of the bore-pipe all the way up. They were to be made fast at their

lower ends to the core tube, but at the top were to be passed over pulleys,
and attached to heavy counterbalance weights for keeping the lines tightly

strained during the descent of the marker. There would thus be about

30 feet in height of each always visible, and by placing a theodolite on

one side, in the plane of the wires, one of them could be kept under

observation, and any deviation from the vertical that might be caused by

unavoidable rotation seen, whereupon the marker would be at once

restored to its correct position by moving the rods round at top. But the

length of wire exposed would have been so small, compared with the full
depth of the hole, that it was feared a considerable amount of twist might

occur at bottom without detection by the instrument. That plan was

consequently given up, and means were contrived for observing the boring

rods themselves, and guiding them in such a manner as to prevent all

possibility of twist. The details of this arrangement I will now explain.
    On the circumference of the crown or tube carrying the marker, the

ends of a diameter were indicated by differently shaped notches. At the
commencement of an experiment, the tube was suspended with these

notches opposite to two sharp

pointers (fig. 7), which were                                  ^'^^- '*·

I should mention that the boring-rods at Ware were made of steel

and were tubular, 1^ inches inside and 2^ inches outside diameter, and

feet in length, with screwed ends (fig. 8). They were coupled up by in-

ternally screwed sockets, but when being lowered or raised they were

connected or disconnected in 30 feet lengths. At about 6 feet from the

axis of the hole, in a convenient direction, was hung a long fine plumb-line

(fig. 9), towards which a horizontal radial arm, clamped on the boring-i'ods
--448 REPORT 1895.

at 30 feet above the ground, was directed. On the outer end of the

radial arm was an adjustable pointer, the sharp edge of which was set to
almost touch the plumb-line. The rods were slowly lowered for .30 feet,

with every endeavour to avoid rotation, but if the radial pointer did

deviate at all from the plumb-line, this was corrected by gently twistino-
Athe rods.
            second radial arm, exactly similar to the first, was then

clamped on at 30 feet higher up, and its pointer accurately set to the

line, after which the lower one was removed. This was repeated until

the marking tool reached the core, and in returning to the surface the

process of fixing and unfixing the radial arms was performed in reverse

order.

the marked diameter on the crown or tube and the unbroken rock, next

claimed attention. Whatever method might be adopted, it was obvious

that it was only whilst the rock was in situ that this relation could be

determined, and consequently the greatest care would be necessary to

ensure that any core operated upon had not been broken oS" during the revo-

lution of the boring crown. At Ware, the first trial was made in the follow-

ing manner. Three steel V-shaped cutters (fig. 10) were fixed on the inside
Hsurface of a boring crown, at a distance of
                                              inches from its lower end,

and with their cutting edges at such a distance from the axis of the crown

as was about ^ of an inch less than the I'adius of the core, whose diameter
was 13^ inches. One of these cutters was set on the line of diameter
indicated by the notches on the outside of the crown, and the other two

cutters were placed at equal distances from the same line on the opposite
       ox THE DIP OF THE UNDERGROUND PALAEOZOIC ROCKS. 449

side of the circle, thus nicarking distinctively the one end of the diameter from

tlie other. Crown and cutters were carefully lowered into the bore hole

and over the core at its bottom, with every precaution to maintain the

aforesaid diameter in the same known direction. They were then brought
up with the same care, and so successfully, that the crown returned to the
surface with its marked diameter exactly in the

direction in which it began to be lowered.                    Fig. 0.

As a check upon what had been done, a cast was

then taken of the rough top of the stone. To do this,         id^'ustabkpomur
a tube of a size to encircle the core (fig. 11) was pre-

pared by fixing a diaphragm in it at a distance of 9 TTvRudwl arnv

inches above its lower end, and filling in beneath this

diaphragm, to a depth of 6 inches, a mass of wax,

softened with spirit of turpentine, and coloured with     y

AVenetian red.    diameter was marked, as in the

preceding case, by notches at either end, and the

whole was lowered upon the core with the same care

to keep the marked diameter in the proper azimuth.          <-3oring rods
Just before making the imprint, water was pumped
through a pipe, \\ inches in diameter, that passed        p
down the middle of both diaphragm and wax. There
was thus removed from the top the sediment that                 Plumb line

would otherwise have prevented a true impression          p
being obtained. The weight of the core-tube, rods,

and boring head, was counterbalanced, so that a pres-

sure of only 10 lbs. per square inch came upon the

surface of the wax, but nevertheless, great difficulty

was experienced in arriving at the proper consistency     p
for the plastic material. If too soft, it would not

retain its place until it reached the bottom, and if

too hard, a satisfactory print could not be obtained.

After several failures, the right admixture was hit

upon, and a cast secured. The tube, with its mould        I
of wax, was then brought up, without having received

the slightest twist from the time it began to descend

to the time at which it again reached the surface. The

core-extractor was afterwards sent down to bring up

the marked core for examination. On its arrival at        (^ »i=

the surface, the three cutter marks were seen in the               t
form of vertical chases more than three feet each in
                                                                 PMxHwuLarrn

length on the outside of the cylinder of rock, and the

irregularities of the top face completely corresponded    ir

with those appearing on the wax cast. By tracing          V\

on the upper end of the core, the diameter marked

on the wax carrier, it was found to coincide exactly ij

with a line passing through the single chase and mid-         scale, i in. to 8 ft.
way between the pair of chases, afi'ording a complete

proof of the accuracy with which the proper direction had been maintained

during lowering.

The Committee being anxious to have full confirmation in every respect

of the results thus obtained, a further test was devised. The bottom of

the hole was faced up quite level by the revolution of suitable cutting

edges, and a groove about 6 inches deep was formed around the circum-

ference to receive sedimsiit, thus forming a core to that height. The

marked crown (fig. 12) was then prepared by fixing across it, near to the

lower edge, a stout bar, on the under side of which were three strong steel

points, arranged in a straight line on the marked diameter. One steel

brought up, exhibited distinctly the three punch marks, indicating the
line whose bearing was known. The boring was then continued 2 feet

deeper, and an attempt was made to take a wax impression of the mark-

ings, but the attempt proved only, that the smooth surface, to which the
ox THE DIP OF THE UNDERGROUND PALEOZOIC EOCKS.  iol

stone had been planed off in order to its being marked with punches, pre-
vented its yielding a proper recognisable impression, owing probably to
adhesion between the two surfaces. The core was tlierefore detached and
drawn up. It came to the surface in several pieces, but, as the lines of
fracture extended below the bottom of the shallow groove which existed
when the punch mai'ks were made, it was evident that no fracture had
taken place before the rock was marked.

     It then remained, in the first place, to measure the angle between the
direction of dip and the diameter marked on the crown or tube;
secondly, to ascertain, by a compass placed beyond the influence of the
iron of the boring machinery, the angle between the direction of the fixed
pointers to which the marked diameters were set and the magnet meridian;
and, thirdly, to learn from an authentic source, the angle then obtaining

between the magnetic and the true meridian. By this process it was
easily determined that the direction of the dip of the Silurian Rock at

Ware, at a depth of 828 feet below the surface, and 31 feet below the top
of the stratum, is about one degree west of true south. This is a mean
between the angles derived from the two distinct experiments, the varia-
tion between them having been 1° 12'. The angle of dip is 41° from the
horizon, as was clearly shown by layers of fossils, along which the stone

easily fractured.

     At Turnford, the general arrangement of the boring apparatus was
much the same as at Ware, the oidy diffei-ence of any consequence being,

that the rods were connected up in 20 feet instead of in 30 feet lengths.
The means employed in determining the dii'ection of dip were somewhat
similar to those already described, but greater difficulty was encountered
in obtaining reliable results. The complete success that had attended the

experiments at Ware warranted the belief that there would not be the
same necessity for repetition as when the methods were first tried ; l)ut
at the same time it was recognised that every result must in some way be

corroborated before it could be accepted as correct.

     In the first instance, three cutters, for making vertical lines on the
outside of the core in the way I have already described, were used. The
precautions which had been successfully adopted to guard against the
angular motion of the marking tool in its descent and ascent were again
employed. But while the said tool was being lowered, an inconsiderate
handling of the apparatus by one of the workmen gave rise to the fear
that some slight disturbance of the true adjustment of that apparatus had
been thereby caused. The marker, on being raised to the surface, came
up, not, as had hitherto happened, in the same position as that from which
it went down, but showed a rotation of [^ of an inch at the circumference,
equal to an angle of 5° 50'. Considering the circumstances attending
the interference that had taken place during the lowering, it was con-
sidered a fair inference that the core had been marked with the tool
turned in the direction in which it came up, not in the position given to
it before it was sent down.

    An endeavour was then made to obtain a cast in wax cement in much

the same manner as at Ware, but this proved a failure owing to a piece
that had broken away from the top of the core having fallen against the
side of the hole, so that the tube carrying the wax could not be got down
 over it. Although no information was to be looked for in this instance,
 still, as a test of the accuracy of the operation, the rods were guided as
 usual during tlieir ascent, and when they came up were found not to

                                                                                                                         G G2

have twisted in the least. The ' extractor ' was then lowered to break off

Aand draw up the core.  length of 18 inches only was brought to the

surface, and this was in three pieces. Upon each of these pieces the

vertical marks of the cutters were found, and the lines were seen to be so

cut as to show that when they were made, the parts of the core were yet

in their relative positions. The force, moreover, which had to be applied

to break the core before it coidd be raised, as well as the unrubbed condi-

tion of the lowest of its pieces, sufficed to prove that all the parts were

in situ at the time at which they were marked.

   A length of core still remaining fixed at bottom, the wax was sent

down again. This time, the bottom of the marking tube lodged for an

instant during its descent on the top of a lining tube some 800 feet down,

but at once swung off, giving a shock to the rods that caused the radial

arm to strike against the staging and turn slightly round on the rod to

which it was clamped. The lowering was then completed, the impression

taken, and the tube brought up again. It was found to have turned

through an ansjle of 3° 11' from the direction in which it stood before

being lowered. Taking into consideration the fact that when no acci-

dental disturbance occurred no variation was observable, and that the

direction of the displacement corresponded with what would be caused by

the blow on the arm, it was clearly justifiable to assume that the angular

movement observed was entirely attributable to the shifting of the de-

scending pointer at the time of the lodgment on the side of the hole. By

taking the bearing of the marked diameter as it returned to the surface

instead of as it commenced to go down, the error due to the misfortune

was corrected. When the core was brought up there was no diflSculty in

fitting the wax cast to the rock and transferring the diametrical line.

The two experiments gave identical results, and from this it was com-

puted that the direction of the dip of the Devonian Rock at Turnford at

a depth of 994 feet below the surface, and 1-4 feet below the top of the

stratum, is about 17° west of true south. The angle of dip is about 25°

from the horizon, as shown by numerous layers of fossils.

     It thus appears that at both places these ancient rocks dip in directions

lying between south and sou'-sou'-west, and by placing on a geological map

of the south-eastern portion of England lines to show the ascertained bear-

ings (fig. 13), it is at once seen that the greatest inclinations of the strata are,

roughly speaking, at right angles to the directions of the chief axes of the

Weald. Soon after the completion of the borings a statement seems to

have been made, without due authority, that the general direction of the dip

had been found to be towards the south-east, and, unfortunately, the mis-

take does not seem to have been publicly refuted until now. It is time that

this misconception were removed, for geologists who are interested in the

search for coal in the eastern counties evidently attach considerable impor-

tance to a correct knowledge of the disposition of these Palaeozoic rocks.

Mathematical accuracy could not be expected in operations of this

nature, but I believe the bearings of the lines of dip at both places, as

herein given, may be looked upon as practically correct, the maximum pos-

sible error being not more than one degree east or west. Before the various

appliances were perfected there occurred numerous failures to which no

reference has been made, but the details given tend to show that no trouble

was spared to attain satisfactory results. More than a month was entirely

devoted to this ascertainment of the direction of the dip at each place, and

in some cases several days were spent in a single operation of lowering and

raising the rods. It will be admitted that all was done with due delibera-
tion and care, whilst the composition of the Committee was a guarantee
that the methods employed were the best adapted for the purpose.

    With regard to the still more important question that the New River

Company undertook to solve, viz., that of the existence or the non-exist-
ence of the Lower Green Sand beneath the district north of London, it will
be generally felt that, although very large sums of money were spent,

there is no reason for regretting the expenditure, inasmuch as it decided
a question of the greatest importaiice to the Metropolis.

    I am glad to have had the opportunity of making known some of the

facts connected with this inquiry, and hoj^e that sufficient evidence has

been brought forward to prove that the statements now made with respect
to the lie of the Palreozoic rocks at Ware and Turnford may be accepted as

perfectly trustworthy.

The work of the Committee, up to the present time, has devolved almost

entirely upon Dr. McKendrick, who has embodied the results of his

reseai'ches in the paper puhlished in the number for July 1895 of the

'Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,' of which the following is an

abstract :

  --1. Increasing the Volume of Tone. The Committee have succeeded in

accomplishing tlais (1) by the use of conical resonators, of great size, and

made  of  tin  or                                                        aluminium                                              and ('_')  by combining with the phonograph

  --2. Study oftlie Marks on the Cylinder of the Phonograph. The physi-

cal nature of the marks on the wax cylinder have been investigated in

the following three ways : (1) Taking a cast in celloidin of the surface

of  the cylinder                                                         (2) taking micro -photographs                                     of  portions of the  surface

of the cylinder                                                          and  (3) recording the curves on a                                    slowly moving surface.
                                                                      ;

The best results were obtained by methods (2) and (3), and these will be

found fully described and illustrated by three plates in the ' Journal of

Anatomy and Physiology ' for July 1895, vol. xxix. (new series ;_vo]. ix.,

part iv.), p. 583.

     The Committee desire reappointment and an additional grant of 25^.
It is proposed to carry out the following work during the year 1895-6 :

     1. To continue the investigation of phonographic curves, especially
those of the voice, and to submit these to harmonic analysis.

     2. To obtain phonographic records of dialects, with the view of ascer-
taining how far such records could be made available for philological
purposes. It has been suggested that such a series of records, deposited
in the British Museum, might in after times, long after dialects had
become altered or had disappeared, be of great value to philologists.

     3. To endeavour to obtain phonogi-aphic records of cardiac and respi-

ratory sounds.

     Report of the Committee, consistinq of Professor A. C. Haddon,
     Professor G. B. Howes, Mr. W. E. Hoyle, Mr. Clement Reid,
     Mr. I. C. Thompson, Mr. A. 0. Walker, Professor F. E. Weiss,

    and Professor W. A. Herdman (Chairman and Reporter).

As ill the previous reports, the work has this year been, of necessity,
chiefly carried out by those members of the Committee who live near the

scene of action, and have been working at the Port Erin Biological
Station. Mr. Clement Reid, however, has been able to undertake in
London some geological investigations of the deposits dredged up and sent
to the Jermyn Street Museum, and his preliminary report will be found
below. Professor Weiss has been prevented by illness from helping in
regard to the botany of the district, but hopes still to undertake the
work. Mr. Walker and Mr. Thompson have contributed special reports
on the Crustacea ; the rest of this report has been drawn up by the
Chairman of the Committee, with the help of various naturalists whose

names are mentioned in connection with their work.
     The Committee have carried on their usual exploring work by means

of dredging expeditions and otherwise during the year. The specimens
obtained have been worked up by specialists, and the most noteworthy
additions to the lists are given below. The Committee do not propose,

however, to give so detailed a report this year, as they desire, if re-

appointed, to draw up for next year's meeting of the Association at
Liverpool a final report with complete lists, which they would appro-
priately illustrate by the exhibition at Liverpool of the collections made,
and by dredging expeditions, both from Liverpool and Port Erin, to
enable the biologists and geologists present at the meeting to judge of the

work of the Committee and examine their results.
      The following, therefore, is merely a brief outline of the work under-

taken during the past year ; with a discussion--for which the chairman

is chiefly responsible-- of some parts of the investigations.

                     DREDGING EXPEDITIONS.

     The Committee have organised the following expeditions since the last

report :

     I. August 19, 1894.--Hired steam trawler 'Lady Loch.' Localities
dredged, around the Calf Island and to the west of Port Erin, at depths

of about 20 fathoms.

     II. August 25, 1894.--Hired steam trawler 'Albatross.' Localities

dredged, the open sea between Isle of Man and Ireland, at depths down
to over .50 fathoms. On this occasion some specimens of the tube-

building polynoid worm Panthalis Oerstedi were obtained, for Mr. Wat-

son's observations on the building habits, which have since been published. >

We also on this occasion photographed various kinds of deposits and

assemblages of animals as they came up in the dredge.
     III. September 30, 1894.-- Hired steam trawler ' Lady Loch.'

Localities dredged, along the west side of the Isle of Man, at depths down

to 60 fathoms.

    At one spot, 6 miles S.E. of Calf Island, 31 fathoms, bottom sand

gravel and shells, such a rich haul was obtained that the trawl-net tore
away, and only a small part of the contents was recovered. That con-
tained, however, a number of specimens of the rare shrimp PuntojMlus

E. tuherosa, Xantho tuherculatus, Fandalus brevirosfris, Anoipagurus
Hyndmanni, Campylasjns sp., and IlelphidijyjKlla macera amongst crus-
taceans, and the following Echinodermata : Falmipes memhranaceus,
Porania j)idvillus, Stichaster rosea, Lluidea Savignii, Si/na2}ta inhcerens,

and other holothurians. There were also, of course, many moUusca,
worms, &.C., and an unfamiliar actinian, which Professor Haddon considers
to be probably his new species Par<ip)hellia expansa, hitherto only known

--from deep water off the south-west coast of Ireland.

dredged, to the \V. and N.W. of Peel and Ballaugh, on the ' North Bank,'

at depths about 20 fathoms.

  --VIII. August 3, 1895. Lancashire Sea Fisheries steamer 'John

Carnarvon Bay, on south coast of Anglesey ; depths 1 5 to 1 8 fathoms.

                   ADDITIONS TO THE FAUNA.

      In addition to these ' steamer ' expeditions there has been frequent
dredging and tow-netting from small boats, and a good deal of ' shore

collecting.'

     Amongst the more noteworthy animals collected in the district during

the year are the following :

from the Diamond Ground, Hastings, was found by Dr. Hanitsch at Port

Erin and at Fleshwick in August and September 1894.

insignisJ Miss L. R. Thornely reports the addition of Perigonimus
repens to the list of hydroids. The yellow variety of Sarcodictyon

[Clavularia) catenata,oi which we dredged several colonies on August 25,
off the north-west of the Calf Island, in 22 fatho ns, is an interesting
addition to our fauna. It has only been found before in Loch Fyne and
at two other spots on the west coast of Scotland. This is certainly the

Sarcodictyon agglomeratum of Forbes and Goodsir.

                                                  Vermes.

     Mr. Beaumont reports the following additions to the list of
Nemertida : Amphiporuspulcher, A. disdmuJans, Tetrastemma Jlavidum,
Prosorhochmus Claparedii, Micrura jnirpurea, M. fasciolata, M. Candida,
and Cerebratulus Jiiscus.

     During this summer we have dredged from a gravelly bottom, at 10
to 15 fathoms, in two localities near Port Erin, a species of Polygordius,
either P. apogon, M'Intosh, or a new species.

     Amongst Polycii.eta Mr. Sumner records Arenicola ecaudata and
Amphitrite Johnstoni ; Mi'. Arnold Watson Autolytus Alexandri (with egg-
sac) and many larval Pectinaria, in membranous tube .jV inch long.

     Amongst Polyzoa Miss Thornely reports the rare Triticella Boechii,

found attached to the prawn Calocaris Macandreoi, from the deep mud off

Port Erin.

    The following Opisthobranchiata may be mentioned : Scaphander

lignarius, Pleurohranclius pluniida, Oscanius memhranaceus, Elysia
viridis, Runcina Hancocki, Lamellidoris aspera, Polycera Lessonii, Cuthona
aurantiaca, Coryphella, gracilis, C. lineata and C. Landshurgii, Faceliiia
DriLmmondi, Eolis arenicola, Cratena concinrm and C. olivacea, Galvina
Farrani, Emhletonia pidchra, Acfceonia corriigata, Limapontia nigra,
Lomanotus genei, and a curious little Doris, which has been dredged
several times in the neighbourhood of Port Erin, and is still unidentified.

It may possibly be an unknown species.

                                                  Crustacea.

     This section is contributed by Mr. I. C. Thompson and Mr. A. O.
Walker, Mr. Thompson taking the Copepoda and Mr. Walker the higher
forms. The following additional records of Copepoda have, however, been
supplied by Mr. Andrew Scott since Mr. Thompson's report was drawn up,
viz. : Sunaristes paguri, Hesse ; Stenhelia reflexa, T. Scott ; Laophonte
intermedia, T. S. ; L. propinqua, T. and A. S.; Cletodes sirnilis, T. S.;
Modiolicola insignis, Aur. ; and Dermatomyzon gibberum, T. and A. S. : all
new to our fauna.

                                                  Copepoda.

    In the last report mention was made of a new copepod found by Mr.
I. C. Thompson in dredged material taken outside Port Erin at 1 5 fathoms.
This has since been described by Mr.. Thompson ('Trans. Liverpool Biol.

PSoc.,'vol. ix. p. 96, plates vi. and vii.) as sexidccyclopia stephoides.

     It was by no means easy to decide into which genus to place this

well-marked species, as it has strong points of resemblance in common

with the three genera, Pseudocalanus, Stephos, and Pseudocydopia. "With
Fseudocyclopia it agrees in all points excepting in the number of joints in
the anterior antenna?, and the primary branch of the posterior antennae,
and as in general appearance and in the first four pairs of swimming feet

it strongly resembles Pseudocydopia, it was decided provisionally to place

it in that genus. Its fifth pair of feet, however, are more like those of
Stephos. In the 'Twelfth Annual Report of the Fishery Board for
Scotland ' Mr. Thomas Scott added a new species belonging to this genus

recently found by him in the Forth area. As the genus Pseudocydopia

forms a sort of missing link between the families Calanidaj and Miso-
phriidae, Mr. Scott has wisely constituted a new family, the Pseudo-
cyclopiidfe, for its reception. The species of Fseudocyclopia described
by him having respectively sixteen and seventeen joints in the anterior
antennae, he has made that number a family cliaracter. The species
here described has, however, twenty joints in the anterior antennae,
and as it otherwise agrees in all respects with the family characters of
Pseudocyclopiida?, Mr. Thompson suggested that the words 'sixteen to
seventeen jointed ' be altered to ' sixteen to twenty jointed ' as a character
of this new family, with which Mr. Scott at once concurred.

     The following species of Copepoda, viz., Diosaccus pii'opinquus, T. and
A. Scott; Ameira exigua, T. Scott; A. longiremis, T. Scott ; Laophonte

inopinata, T. Scott; Pseudoicestu-oodia pyymcea.T. and A. S. ; and possibly
a new Laoplionte and one or two other doubtful species were obtained
from washings from sponges collected by Dr. Hanitsch at Port Erin in

August 1894, and are new to the district.
     One specimen of ModioJicola insignis, Aurivillius, also new to the

district, was found in the washings of dredged material taken some miles
off Peel in June 1895. This species is known as a messmate within the

shell of the ' horse mussel ' {Mytilus modiolus), and has been recorded by
Canu ('Les Copep. du Boulon.,' p. 238, plate xxx. fig. 14-20), and more
recently by Mr. Scott from the Firth of Forth.

   A small collection has been made by Mi\ R. L. Ascroft, of Lytham,

from trawl refuse and a tow-net attached to the trawl beam when working
in the southern part of the Irish Sea off Galley Head. The most interest-
ing feature of it is that nearly all the specimens are adult males, in which
condition amphipods are less often taken than any other. This may
perhaps be attributed to their having been taken late in November, a

season at which collectors do not generally dredge.

         SOME STATISTICS OF DREDGING RESULTS.

    During this year's work we have been paying some attention to the
actual numbers of individuals, species, and genera brought up in
particular hauls of the dredge or trawl. Our attention has recently been
directed to the matter by some statements in Dr. Murray's ' Summary *
--4C0 REPORT 189 J.

volumes of the ' Challenger ' Expedition Report which seemed not to be

in accord with our experience. Dr. Murray quotes the statistics of the

Scottish Sea Fisheries Board to show that only 7-3 species of invertebrates

and 8-3 species of fishes are captured on the average by the 'Garland's'

beam trawl ^                                             and he cites as an example of a large and varied haul from
                                                      ;

deep water one taken by the 'Challenger' at Station 146 in the Southern

Ocean, at a depth of 1,375 fathoms, with a 10-foot trawl dragged for at

most 2 miles during at most two hours, when 200 specimens were cap-

tured belonging to fifty-nine genera and seventy-eight species. Murray

then goes on to say : 'In depths less than 50 fathoms, on the other hand,

I cannot find in all my experiments any record of such a variety of

organisms in any single haul, even when using much larger trawls and

dragging over much greater distances.' He must ha^-e been singularly

unfortunate in his experiments, as our experience of dredging in the Irish

Sea is that quite ordinary hauls of the dredge or very small trawl (only

4-foot beam) contain often more specimens, species, and genera than

the special case cited from the ' Challenger ' results. On the first of our

expeditions after the appearance of Dr. Murray's volumes we counted the

--contents of the first haul of the trawl. The particulars are as follows :

June 23, 7 miles W. of Peel, on North Bank, bottom sand and shells,

depth 21 fathoms, trawl 4 feet beam, down for 20 minutes; 232 specimens

were counted, but there may well have been another 100 ; they belonged
to at least 112 species and 103 genera, a larger number in every

--respect-- specimens, species, and genera than tlie 'Challenger' haul

quoted. The list of these species is here given, and the marine zoologist

will see at a glance that it is nothing out of the way, but a fairly ordi

nary assemblage of not uncommon animals such as is frequently met when

dredging in from 15 to 30 fathoms.

    These numbers have been exceeded on many other liauls in the

ordinary course of work by the Fisheries steamer in Liverpool Bay. For
example, on this occasion the tish numbered 5,943, and I have records of
hauls in which the fish numbered over 20,000. The shrimps probably
number as many again, and if the starfishes and other abundant inverte-
brates are added the total must sometimes reach such enormous numbers

as from 45,000 to 50,000 specimens in a single haul of the trawl in shallow-

water, not including microscopic forms. Can any of Dr. Murray's hauls
on the deep mud beat these figures ?

    On the next occasion, when on board the ' John Fell,' on our own

expedition of August 3, two members of this committee (A. O. Walker

and W. A. Herdman) identified the species brought up in the first haul
of the trawl (5-inch mesh), taken in Red Wharf Bay, Anglesey, at a depth

of 4-7 fathoms. They wei-e 78 species, belonging to 67 genera, as follows :

A point which comes out in making complete lists, such as the above,

of the contents of the net on one haul is the relatively large number of

genera represented by the species.' In the haul, quoted above, from the

expedition of June 23 the 112 species were referred to 103 genera ; in

the haul from the Fisheries steamer on July 23 tlie 39 species obtained

belong to 34 genera ; and in the haul on August 3 there were 78 species

--and 67 genera. Taking a few instances of particular groups on August 25,

1894, the 12 species of Tunicata taken in one haul represented 10

g&enera ; and Mr. Walker reports the following numbers of species and

--genera in hauls of the higher Crustacea : March, 1893, off Rhos, shallow,

19 species in  18 genera                                                        May  1893,  off  E,hos,  2 fathoms,  24 species in 21
                                                                             ;

gaenera : July 1893, off Little Orme, 5 to 10 fathoms, 31 species in 28

genera ; October 1893, off Little Orme, 4 to 10 fathoms, 41 species in 36

genera ; September 1894, off Little Orme, shallow, 39 species in 3.5 genera ;

and April 1895, off Port Erin, 34 fathoms, 40 species in 35 genera.

These figures are particularly interesting in their bearing on the

Darwinian principle that an animal's most potent enemies are its own

close allies. Is it theii the case, as the above cited instances suggest,

that the species of a genus rarely live together ; that if in a haul you get

half-a-dozen species of lamellibranchs, amphipods, or annelids they will

probably belong to as many genera, and if these genera contain other

British species these Avill probably occur in some other locality, perhaps

on a different bottom, or at another depth ? It is obviously necessary to

count the total number of genera and species of the groups in the local

fauna, as known, and compare these with the numbers obtained in par-

ticular hauls. That has been done to some extent with the ' Fauna ' of

Liverpool Bay, and the following instances may be taken as samples.

The known number of species of higher Crustacea is 90, and these fall into

60 genera. So the genera are to the species as 2 to 3, whereas in the
collections quoted from Mr. Walker above the genera are to the species

on the average about as 28 to 31, or nearly 7 to 8. Again, the total

number of species of Tunicata is 46, and these are referred to 20 genera
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

while in the case given above (August 25, 1894) the 12 species taken on

one spot represented 10 genera, or, a little over a quarter of the species

represented half the genera. These, and many other cases which we

might quote, seem to show that a disproportionately large number of

genera is represented by the assemblage of species at one spot, which

Wemeans that closely related species are, as a rule, not found together.

know of some cases, however, of allied species occurring together, but these

do not necessarily affect the general argument. It is possible also that

sessile animals, such as hydroids and polyzoa, may form a partial excep-

tion, and may differ from wandering forms in their method of competition.

We are accumulating further statistics on these points.

                   THE SUBMARINE DEPOSITS.

     In last year's report the nature of the deposits forming on the floor
of the Irish Sea was discussed in a preliminary manner. During this
season's work the bottom brought up on each occasion has been carefully

noted and a sample kept for future study in the Jermyn Street Museum.
One point which this collection of deposits from comparatively shallow

     ' Dr. Murray, in the ' Challenger ' Summary, notes this fact in the case of deep-
sea hauls, but does not seem to recognise its application to shallower waters.
                  ----

--464 REPORT 1895.

shore waters seems to bring out is that the classification of submarine
deposits into 'terrigenous' and 'pelagic,' which was one of the earliest
oceanographic results of the ' Challenger ' Expedition, and which is still
adhered to in the latest 'Challenger' volumes as an accepted classification,
does not adequately represent or express fully the facts. Terrigenous
deposits are supposed to be those formed round continents from the waste
of the land, and are stated to contain on the average 68 per cent, of silica.
Pelagic deposits are those formed in the open ocean from the shells and
other remains of animals and plants living on the surface of the sea above.

     Ordinary coast sands and gravels and muds are undoubted terrirjenous
deposits. Globigerina and j-adiolarian oozes are typical pelagic deposits.
But in our dredgings in the Irish Sea, where the deposits ought all to be
purely terrigenous, we meet with several distinct varieties of bottom
which are not formed mostly from the waste of the land, and do not con-

tain anything like 08 per cent, of silica ; but, on the contrary, are formed

very largely of the remains of plants and animals, and may contain as

little as 23 per cent, of silica. Such are the nullipore bottoms, and the
shell sand and shell gravel met with in some places, and the sand formed of

comminuted spines and plates of echinoids which we have found off the
Calf Island. These deposits are really much more nearly allied in their

nature, and in respect of the kind of rock which they would probably
form if consolidated, to the calcareous oozes amongst pelagic deposits than
they are to terrigenous deposits, and yet they are formed on a continental
area close to land in shallow water. Moreover, although agreeing with the
pelagic deposits in being largely organic in origin, they differ in being
derived not from surface organisms, but from plants (the nullipores) and
animals which lived on the bottom. Consequently tlie division of deposits
into ' terrigenous ' and ' pelagic ' ought to be modified or replaced by the

following classification :

   --1. Terrigenoits (Murray's term) where the deposit is formed chiefly of

                                 mineral particles derived from the waste of the land.

   --2. Neritic'^ where the deposit is chiefly of organic origin, and is

                                 derived from the shells and other hard parts of the
                                animals and plants living on the bottom.

   --3. Planktonic (Murray's pelagic) where the greater part of the

                                 deposit is formed of the I'emains of fi'ee-swimming
                                animals and plants which lived in the sea above the

                                         deposit.

    Mr. Clement Reid, F.G.S., to whom the deposits are handed over for

detailed examination, reports as follows :

     ' The series of dredgings examined since the last report is most inter-
esting from a geological point of view. One is again struck by the common

--occurrence of loose angular stones at places and depths apparently well

beyond the reach of any bottom drift at least beyond the reach of
currents likely to move such coarse material. This stony sea-bed is in all
probability the result of submarine erosion of glacial deposits. Its occur-
rence renders comparison between recent marine deposits of these latitudes
and Tertiary deposits a task of peculiar difficulty ; for not only is the
nature of the true marine sediments masked, but the fauna also must be

     ' Adopted from Haeckel's term for the zone of shallow water marine fauna
(see PlanMon-Studien, Jena, 1890; also Hickson's Fauna of Beev Sea, 1894).
       ON TIIK MARINE ZOOLOGY OF THE IRISH SEA.         465

greatly altcrod. It is evident that numerous species which need a firm
base on whicli to attix themselves will be encouraged by a stony bottom ;
while in a Tertiary deposit, formed under identical conditions, except for

the absence of stones, they may be entirely missing, having nothing but

dead shells to which to attach themselves.
     ' Notwithstanding this peculiarity of most of the dredgings, a few

samples may well be compared with our Older Pliocene (Coralline Crag).

I would particularly draw attention to certain localities where material
almost entirely of organic origin has been obtained. Of these perhaps the
most interesting are some samples full of Cellaria Jistulosa (found to the

south-east of the Calf Sound, 20 fathoms). They are in many respects

strikingly like certain paints of the Coralline Crag. The more ordinary

type of Coralline Crag, with its extremely varied polyzoon fauna, we

cannot yet match in British seas : it was probably formed, as the moUusca
indicate, in a sea several degrees warmer than ours.

     ' It wag hoped that in the course of these dredgings some light might
be thrown on the Tertiary strata underlying the bed of the Irish Sea, for
in the North Sea the dredge occasionally brings up hauls of Tertiary
fossils. This expectation has not yet been realised.; but possibly, by
dredging in the channels where the submarine scour is greatest, such

deposits may yet be reached. It is very important to obtain some know-

ledge of the Tertiary bed of the Irish Sea, for Irish Pleistocene deposits

contain a considerable admixture of extinct forms, which may be derived

from Tertiary deposits below the sea-level. The Glacial Drift of Aber-
ileenshire contains Pliocene Volutes and Astartes, derived from some
submarine deposit off the Aberdeenshire coast. The so-called " Middle
Glacial Sands " of Norfolk ai'e full of shells which I now believe to be
ilerived from some older deposit, probably beneath the sea.'

     The imjiortant influence of the shore rocks upon the littoral fauna has
not been neglected, and lists and observations are accumulating, but that
subject is left over for a fuller discussion in the final report next year.

                      OTHER INVESTIGATIONS.

     Several new lines of investigation have been started during the yeal',
and are still in progress. One of these may be called the ' larval-attacli-
ment inquiry,' and consists in sinking in various parts of the bay an
apparatus composed of a rope weighted at one end and buoyed at the
other, and having a number of slips of glass, slate, wood, etc., attached at
equal distances along its length. These ropes are hauled up and examined
periodically, and may be exjiected when further observations have been
taken to give information as to the times and modes of attachment of the
larvse of various species, and also as to the most suitable substances for
particular kinds of larvje to settle down upon. So far glass seems the
favourite substance, and a surprisingly large number of algae compared

with the animals have appeared.

       ' Drift Bottles ' a\d Surface Currents.

In connection with the investigation of the surface life, in discussing

the appearance and disappearance of swarms of certain Copepoda and

Medusae, and in considering the possible influence of the movements of

such food matters upon tiie migrations of fishes, and also in connection

with the movements of the fish ova and floating embryos, it occurred to

currents, tidal ^ or otherwise, such as the movement of surface waters

caused by prevalent winds. The Prince of Monaco started a few years

ago the system of distributing over the North Atlantic large numbers of

small floating copper vessels, with the object of finding out where they

drifted to. This plan we have adopted, with slight modifications, and in

September 1894 we started the distribution of what may be called ' drift

   A paper was then placed in each bottle, so folded that the number

could be readily seen through the glass, the cork was well pressed down,
and dipped in melted paraffin. Some hundreds of these bottles have,
since September 30, been dropped into the sea in various parts of our
area, a record being kept of the locality and time when each was set free.

Many have been let off at intervals of a quarter of an hour from the Isle
of Man steamer in crossing to Douglas and back, and from our trawler

when dredging between Port Erin and Ireland. Some dozens have been
let off" from Mr. Alfred Holt's steamers in going round to Holyhead and
in coming down from Greenock. Mr. Dawson on the Fishery steamer
' John Fell ' has distributed a number along the coast in the northei'n part

of the district, and others have been set free at stated intervals during

the rise and fall of the tide from the Morecambe Bay Light Vessel, and
Lieutenant Sweny has kindly arranged to have a similar periodic distri-

bution from the Liverpool North-west Liglit Vessel. Altogether, nearly

33 per cent., or about one in three of the papers distributed, have been

--They come from various parts of the coast of the Irish Sea Scotland,

England, Wales, Isle of Man, and Ireland. Some of the bottles have

gone quite a short distance, having evidently been taken straight ashore

by the rising tide. Others have been carried an unexpected length, e.g.,

one (No. 35), set free near the Crosby Light Vessel, oft" Liverpool, at

12.30 P.M., on October 1, was picked up at Saltcoats, in Ayrshire, on

November 7, having travelled a distance of at least 180 miles ' in thirty-

seven days ; another (H. 20) was set free near the Skerries, Anglesey, on
October 6, and was picked up, one mile north of Ardrossan, on November 7,
having travelled 150 miles in thirty-one days; and bottle No. 1, set free

at the Liverpool Bar on September 30, was picked up at Shiskin, Arran,

about 165 miles off, on November 12. On the other hand, a bottle

(J. F. 34) set free on November 7, at the Ribble Estuary, was picked up
on November 1 2 at St. Anne's, having gone only 4 miles.

  --It would be premature as yet until many moi"e dozens or hundreds

--have been distributed and returned to draw any very definite conclusions.

It is only by the evidence of large numbers that the vitiating effect of

exceptional circumstances, such as an unusual gale, can be eliminated.

Prevailing winds, on the other hand, such as would usually affect the

drift of surface organisms, are amongst the normally acting causes which

Wewe are trying to ascertain.       may, however, state, for what they are

--worth, the following results obtained so far : (1) Nearly 50 per cent, of
the bottles found have been carried across to Ireland, and they are chiefly

ones that had been set free in the southern part of the district (between

Liverpool and Holyhead) and ofi" the Isle of Man                                                                                                                                                            (2)  the bottles set free
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

along the Lancashire coast and in Morecambe Bay seem chiefly to have

been carried to the south and west, to about Mostyn and Douglas

(3) it is apparently only a few that have been carried out of the district

Board for Scotland has also commenced a similar inquiry by the distribu-

Notion of floating bottles in the Scottish territorial waters.                                                                                                                                                   account of

their experiment has yet appeared, but it will be of some importance to

compare results with them, say, at the end of the first year's work.

The Committee apply to be reappointed for one additional year, with

a grant of 50^., to enable them to carry on their investigations and draw

up a final report.

The Committee was appointed in 1890, and has been annually re-

the same purposes, it decided, as stated in its Report made at Oxford, that

Mr. Perkins should return home from the Sandwich Islands. He accord-

ingly arrived in England last autumn, and for the next four months was

engaged in overhauling the very large collections he had previously made.

These proved to be of great importance, and the Committee has gratefully

to acknowledge the zeal and perseverance displayed by Mr. Perkins in

carrying out its wishes. As was to be expected, close examination made
it evident that much still remained to be done to complete the Commit-

tee's work of exploration. From the information given by Mr. Perkins,

it was clear that, unless the deficiencies be made good without loss of time,
this will never be done, the extinction of many members of the still

existing Fauna being not only inevitable, but immediate. The Com-

mittee, believing that it would be a matter for serious regret if the task,

on which so much labour and money have already been expended, were

left unfinished, resolved to send Mr. Perkins out again. With this object

it applied to the Council of the Royal Society for the sum of 100/., which

was granted, in order that he might start without delay, so as to take

advantage of the most favourable season of the present year. Mr. Perkins

reached Honolulu liefore the end of March last, and has since been

working, chiefly in the islands of Kauai and Hawaii.

The Committee has also to report that a proposal has been received

from the trustees of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu, offering,

on certain conditions, to contribute liberally to the expenses of the iiivesti-

:gation your Committee is carrying on. Briefly stated, these terms are

that the trustees of the Museum in question are to have the third set of

the specimens collected by Mr. Perkins. Authority to treat with this

Museum Avas given by the Government Grant Committee of the Royal

Society, and it is hoped that the British Association will also approve of

±his course.

The Joint Committee has also decided that the first set of the birds

-tjollected by Mr. Perkins shall be placed in the British Museum, and the

second set in that of the University of Cambridge.

Since the last report attention has been directed to working out the

Acollections and furnishing detailed accounts thereof.  report on the

Urthoptera is daily expected from Herr Hofrath Brunner von Wattenwyl

Lord Walsingliam has commenced the examination of the Micro-Lepi-

doptera, Mr. E. Meyrick that of the larger Lepidoptera. The Mollusca

-iiave been entrusted to Mr. E. R. Sykes, who is working at them with

the assistance of Mr. E. A. Smith. The Neuroptera have been sent to

Mr. R. McLaclilan. Mr. Perkins has published a second paper on the

Birds ; he also, while he was in this country last winter, made considerable

progress in working out the Ilymenoptera. The Rev. F. O. Pickard

^Cambridge has looked over the Spiders hitherto received, and estimates

them at about 200 species, of which it is probable the majority may prove

to be new. The extensive series of Coleoptera is being prepared, at the

Cambridge University Museum, for examination.

The Committee is at present in want of funds to maintain Mr.

Perkins in the islands until it receives money on accoun'-, of the proposed

.agreement with the trustees of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. It there-

fore asks for reappointment, with power to avail itself of the assistance

vof this Museum, and for a grant of 100/.

I. On a Blood-forming Organ in the Larra of Magelona.
                  By Florence Buchanan, B.Sc.

    In August of 189.3 the British Association kindly allowed me the use

of their table at Plymouth for the purpose of studying the development of
Magelona. I was unfortunately prevented from working out the material

collected there in time to present my report to the last meeting ; and even

now what new observations I have to record concern the development

of the vascular system only, and I must leave the development of the

other organs, or systems of organs, to be described later by myself or
some other investigator from a more extended series of stages than I at

present possess.

There is a good deal of individual variation with regard to the time

of the first appearance of the vascular system, as there is, indeed,

with regard to that of other organs also, in the lar\a of Magelona. I

have seen a well-developed pulsatile dorsal vesicle, the so-called ' heart,'

in larvfe with only eight or nine segments, all bearing provisional chastse,

whilst in other larva3 with a good many more segments there has been

no trace of such structure, nor of vascular sytem at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The                                        ''

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ' heart

which is always the first part of the system to make its appearance, and

the dorsal and ventral vessels after it are formed, to begin with, by the

accumulation of a transparent fluid between tlie splanchnic layer of

mesoblast and the hypoblast, beginning anteriorly, and thereby causin"-

a pouching of the splanchnic mesoblast in front to form the walls of the

'heart,' which lies mainly in front of the hypoblastic portion of the

alimentary canal and over the pharynx, and gradually extending back-

wards. By the time that the larva has reached the stage in which the

body is divided into three regions, and sometimes before the loss of the

provisional chietfe of the middle region, there is seen in the livino' larva

at the posterior end of the dorsal vessel, or of what is goino- to become

the dorsal vessel, and in the middle region of the body, a dark reddish-

brown mass. This is seen in sections to consist of a much swollen

portion of the splanchnic mesoblast in which there are many nuclei, but

no distinct cell boundaries, and completely blocking up the space between

it and the hypoblast. In later stages, when the splanchnic mesoblast has
--470 REPORT 1895.

closed round so as to nip off the dorsal and ventral vessels entirely from
the hypoblast, this brown body is no longer to be seen ; but floating in the
liquid of both dorsal and ventral vessels, and also in the vessels of the
tentacles, are pale pink-coloured corpuscles, which in sections are seen to
have the appearance of broken-off bits of the dark body present in the
earlier stage, and containing for the most part each more than one

nucleus. There seems to me to be very little doubt that by the further

breaking up of such multinucleate corpuscles the blood-corpuscles of the

adult (which were described by Benham at the meeting of the British

Association last year) would be formed. I was unfortunately not able to
obtain later larval stages and to observe this breaking up going on. But

I think my sections of what stages I have justify me in concluding that

the peculiar dark body of the middle region of the larva is a corpuscle-
forming organ. I do not, however, wish to maintain that all the cor-
puscles of the adult are formed from this larval organ on the contrary,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

to judge by sections of the adult, which Dr. Bles kindly lent me to look

through whilst I was at Plymouth, I think this is at least a .special blood-
forming region in the dorsal vessel of the adult ; but, without having
intermediate stages, and a complete series of sections of the adult, I
cannot say whether this region corresponds to that in which the larval
organ lies. I should like to point out the resemblance which this pro-
visional larval organ bears, both in structure and position, to what I have

called the ' vascular ridge ' in part of the dorsal vessel of Ilekatero-
branchus (' Q.J. M.S.,' xxxi. pp. 183, 184, pi. xxii. fig. 6). Like other

members of the family Spionida>, Ilekaferobrcmchus has no corpuscles
in its blood, and the presence of an organ in the dorsal vessel so closely
resembling the one in the dorsal vessel of the larval Magelona suggests,
in the light of the facts I have stated above, either that it at one time
did have blood-corpuscles formed by a special organ, now persisting only as
a vestigial rudiment, or that an organ once having some other significance
in both animals has acquired a new significance in the one {Magelona).

               II. On the Kervoiis System of the Embryonic Lobster.

                             By Edgar J. Allen, B.Sc

      Whilst occupying a table at the Marine Biological Association's

Laboratory during June and July 189-1 I was enabled to continue my

observations on the nervous system of the embryonic lobster. The

observations were carried on, as before, with the aid of methylen-blue.
      Additional elements connecting the various ganglia of the thorax

with the brain were observed, and their course followed. In the nine
ganglia of which the thoracic nerve-chain is really composed, such

elements have now been demonstrated in the second (with branches to

first and third), the fifth (with branches to fourth and sixth), the eighth
(with branches to seventh and ninth), and in the eleventh (with branches
to tenth and first abdominal). In this way all the eleven ganglia of the
thorax, together with the first abdominal ganglion, are put into direct
communication with the brain by means of the four elements whose cells
lie in the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh ganglia.

     Of elements belonging to new types which were observed the most

interesting were those motor elements which, taking origin in a single
cell, gave rise to two or more branches, which passed out of the central
nervous system by the nerve-roots of different ganglia. For example, a
           :.

ON THE LABORATORY OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. 471

cell lying in the anterior portion of the lateral mass of ganglion cells in

the eighth thoracic ganglion was seen to give off a moderately fine fibre,

which divided into two branches, one branch passing immediately out of

the ganglion through tlie anterior nerve-root, whilst the other ran for-

wards along the ganglionic cord. The forward branch pursued a perfectly

straight course until it reached the third thoracic ganglion, where it gave

off a branch passing out through the posterior root of the ganglion, and

then continued to run forwards to the second thoraci6 ganglion, passing

out through its posterior root. Hence this element, the cell of which lay in

the eighth thoracic ganglion, supplied fibres to three nerve-roots belonging to

different ganglia, namely, the anterior root of Thorax VIII., the posterior
Aroot of Tliorax III., and the posterior-root of Thorax II.
                                                             number of

additional elements were also found in the abdomen. These resemble in

a general way those of the thorax, and will be described in detail in a

paper which will be published in the ' Quarterly Journal of Microscopical

Science.'

     Ill, On the Eclbinoderin Fauna of Plymouth. By J. C. Sumner.

    On receiving the nomination to the British Association Table at

Plymouth, I went down in the early part of January with the intention
of working at the Echinoderm fauna of the neighbourhood. Unluckily,
during the greater part of the time the weather was too bad to permit of
any dredging or trawling being done outside the Sound. In consequence

the following list is largely compiled from specimens already in the
collections at Plymouth. One unnamed specimen in a bottle turned out
to be Amphiura Chiajii. It was taken two miles S. of the Bi-eakwater,
and I believe has not been recorded so far south before.

The Committee have received from Mr. C. Da\ ies Slierborn t}ie following

report of work done since the last meeting of the Association.

           Report of ]York done from July 1, 1894, to June 30, 1895.

     Considerable pi'Ogress has been made in recording during the past
year, no less than 480 books and pamphlets having been searched page by
page. The chief works dealt with were the French dictionaries of the
early part of the century ; and when it is mentioned that one of these

(' Dictionnaire des Sciences naturelles ') runs to sixty volumes of 500 pages
each, some idea of the labour expended will be arrived at.

   --The determination of exact date of publication has been proceeded

with, the chief results comprising

                             ' Sowerby's Recent and Fossil Shells.'
                               ' Shaw's JSTaturalist's Miscellany.'
                               ' Moore's Lepidoptera Indica.'

     Remembering the generous gift of the Association last year, the

compiler does not ask for a grant on this occasion, but merely for the
reappointment of the Committee.

--Migration of Bird?. Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor

    A. Newton (Chairman), Mr. John Cordeaux (Secretary), Mr.
    J. A. Harvie-Brown, Mr. Wm. Eagle Clarke, Mr. R. M.

     Barrington, and tJie Rev. E. Ponsonby Knubley, appointed to

      malce a Digest of the Observations on the Migration of Birds at

     Lighthouses and Light-vessels.

The Committee have to report that one of their number, Mr. Wm. Eagle

Clarke, has, after very great labour, completed the tabulation, on 2,500
prepared sheets, of tlie schedules sent in during nine years from th«
lighthouses and light-vessels on the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland,
not a single entry in the original schedules having been omitted. These
tabulated sheets have reference to the various birds observed on migration
under the separate headings of species, locality, and date.

     There now remains the i-eal and most important part of the work

--the results arrived at by the nine years' observation^ and in order to

complete this it is necessary again to consult the vast pile of original
schedules with reference to several important headings having connection
Avith meteorological conditions and direction of flight.

m.^List of Papers which were published in 1894 hij Naturalists who

          have occupied Tables in the Zoological Station                 478

The Table in the Naples Zoological Station hired by the British Asso-

ciation has been occupied during the past year, under the sanction of your

Committee, by Mr. M. D. Hill, who has continued his investigations on
the maturation and fecundation of the ova of certain Echinoderms and

Tunicates, and has arrived at several interesting and original conclusions,
which are briefly sketched out in the appended report of his work which
Mr. Hill has furnished.

     Your Committee would draw attention to the concluding remarks

in Mr. Hill's report respecting the advantages attending the occupation
of a table at N.aples apart from the exceptional facilities for special and
predetermined investigations ; and your Committee consider that this
furnishes an argument which is alone more than sufficient to justify the
continuance of the grant.

     Your Committee trust that the General Committee will sanction the
payment of the grant of 100^., as in previous years, for the hire of the

Table in the Zoological Station at Naples.

     The efficiency of the Station in promoting research is now so universally

recognised that a recapitulation is unnecessary ; and it is an eloquent
fact that notwithstanding the rapid multiplication of biological laboratories

throughout Europe and America, the number of naturalists who avail

themselves of the Naples institution averages between fifty and sixty

annually.

     Perhaps the most far-reaching move yet undertaken by the Zoological

Station consists in the establishment of a small Zoological Station on New
Britain (also known as Neu Pommern), an island adjacent to New Guinea.

Mr. Parkinson, a planter, who had lived there for some years, recently
called upon Dr. Dohrn in Naples, and expressed his willingness to erect a

small building on his estate suitable for a laboratory, if the Naples Station
would provide all the necessary apparatus. This generous offer was

accepted, and the requisite equipment was duly despatched from Germany
and Naples last September.

     At the same time Mr. Arthur Willey, whose name is well known for
his work on Tunicates and Amphioxus, and who has previously occupied
--

AT THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.  475

the British Association Table, announced his intention of going to New-
Britain for the purpose of studying the anatomy and embryology of
Nautilus pompilius, and kindly offered to assist in the erection and

management of the new laboratory.
     Dr. Dohrn laid great stress on the necessity of instructing native

fishermen for the service of the new Station in order to save European
naturalists as much as possible all bodily exertion connected with their
scientific pursuits, and to enable them to concentrate full energy on their
mental work. With this object in view Mr. Parkinson has sent two
young Papuans to Naples, and they are now being instructed by Signer
Salvatore Lobianco in the various and well-known arts of the Zoological
Station. From the latest accounts received from Naples this novel
experiment of transforming two Papuans into biological fishermen offers

every prospect of success.

     This new Colonial Station will remain under the control of the Naples
Station, and Dr. Dohrn hopes soon to make known such regulations and
conditions as may enable competent naturalists to work there profitably

and successfully.
     The progress of the various publications undertakeii by the Station is

summarised as follows :
     1. Of the ' Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel,' the monograph

by Dr. W. Miiller on 'Ostracoda' (404 pp., 40 plates), has been published.

Monographs by Dr. Biirger on ' Nemertinea ' and by Dr. Jatta on

' Cephalopoda ' are in the press.
      2. Of the ' Mittheilungen aus der Zoologischen Station zu Neapel,'

vol. xi., parts iii. and iv., with 11 plates, have been published.
      3. Of the ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht,' the whole ' Bericht ' for 1893

has been published.

    A4. new and thoroughly revised German edition of the ' Guide to the

Aquarium ' has been published.

      The details extracted from the general report of the Zoological Station,
wliich have been courteously furnished by the officers, will be found at

the end of this report. They embrace lists (1) of the naturalists who

have occupied tables since the last report, and (2) of the works published
during 1894 by naturalists who have worked at the Zoological Station.

      The preserved specimens sent out by the station during the year
ending June 1895 comprised 180 consignments, amounting to about
 14,900 fr., as against 194 consignments amounting to 17,687"70 fr. in the

 preceding year.

     I. lieport 011 the Occupation of the Table. By Mr. M. D. Hill.

     I occupied the Table of the British Association from October 1, 1894,
to February 20, 189.5.

     I investigated the matui-ation and fecundation of the ova of certain
Echinoderms and Tunicates in order to clear up, if possible, certain
debated points, more especially as regards the origin and behaviour of the

centrosome. When I began to work, Fol's account of the ' Quadrille des

Centres ' had been accepted unchallenged, and so gratifying were his
results from a theoretical standpoint, that several text-books had re-
produced his figures as being true representations of what actually
476.                             --KEPORT 1895.

occurs. Since sending in an account of my work to await publication,

two memoirs ' have appeared dealing with the same subject. The authors

have arrived at practically the same results, and as they all agree very

closely, it is unnecessary to recapitulate mine, at any length. It will be

sufficient to state that according to all three accounts there is nothing

resembling a 'quadrille'; the centrosomes and astrospheres owe their

origin to the ' body ' of  the  spermatozoon                                                      and  there  is  no  trace  of  an
                                                                                               ;

egg-centi-e or egg astrosphere. In the tiner details, however, our accounts

differ somewhat, and I venture to think that Messrs. Wilson & Matthews

have entirely, and Professor Boveri partly, overlooked the true centro-

some. The two former authors describe the astrosphere as containing

no centrosome proper, but in its place a network closely resembling an

ordinary nuclear reticulum. This condition is maintained throughout.

Boveri, on the other hand, finds a minute deeply-staining centrosome

shortly after the sperm head has penetrated into the ovum. In the later

stages this centrosome swells up into a large hollow vesicle. I agree with

Boveri in his first statement, but believe that later on he has missed the

true centrosome, and has figured and described as a vesicle the ' heller

Hof,' for I find at this stage a deeply-staining sharply-defined centrosome

Myin the midst of a clear ' heller Hof.'                                                          attention was chiefiy confined

to Sphaerechinus granularis, and it may be, though it seems highly

improbable, that a diflTerent process may take place in different species.

     In the tunicates PhaUusla viamiUata and Ciona intestinalis I found

much the same relations as in the Echinoderms as regards the origin and

behaviour of the centrosome, and for this investigation the Ascidian o\um

proved a very favourable object to study. I have been able to trace

carefully the maturation and fertilisation in rhallusia, and have coupled

my results in one paper with those T obtained from studying the

Echinoderms. I was also able, though with rathtr less certainty, to make
out the number and mode of division of the chromosomes during

maturation. The nucleus of the ovocyte I. (to use Boveri's well-known

nomenclature) contains eight chromosomes. From their subsequent

behaviour I see no reason to suppose that they form two ' Vierer Gruppen,'

but look upon them as of equal independent value. The eight chromo-

somes divide by transverse division into sixteen for each polar body,

eight therefore remaining in the nucleus of the ovum (female pro-nucleus).

There is therefore, here at any rate, no ' reducing ' or ' equalling ' division.
Owing to the very small size and close approximation together of the

chromosomes, this part of the work was attended with considerable

difficulty.

The sperm head breaks up into eight chromosomes, and the first

segmentation spindle therefoie contains sixteen, the normal number for

the species.

It would be out of place to discuss here the bearing these results may

have on points of general cytology, or on those theories of heredity which

have been based on observations of like phenomena in other forms, above

all, in Ascaris 7negaIocephala.

      Before closing this report, however, I should like to emphasise once
more the great advantages which an occupation of a Table at the Naples

Station has for a student of zoology, and especially for one who like

myself had just finished his University course. Although original research

is doubtless the main object of most who go to Naples, still it is impossible

to over-estimate the value of the knowledge gained" by seeing and becoming
acquainted with the rich fauna of the bay. Personally speaking, to observe

alive so many forms only seen before in drawings, or at most as preserved

specimens, has been a source of keen enjoyment. Further, the intercourse

with men of other nationalities, and of other ideas and methods, cannot
but have a beneficial effect on those who stay for any length of time.
For these privileges my sincere thanks are due to the Committee of the

British Association.

     G. J. Symons, Mr. H. N. Dickson, and Dr. H. R. Mill (Secre-

      tary). (Drawn up In/ the Chairman.)

Your Committee in the course of last year granted a complete set of

instruments, including a mercurial barometer presented to them by the

Meteorological Council, to the Scottish missionaries established at

Kibwezi, on the road from Mombasa to Machako's. They also supplied
Mr. Hobley, now in Uganda, with one of Symons's earth' ther'mometers.

 ...Sets of instruments have now been supplied to the following

stations :

   --BoJobo (Rev. R. Glennie). Registers up to date have been regularly

received since January 1891. The abstract for the past year has been
prepared by Mr. H. N. Dickson.

   --Lauderdale, Nyasaland (Mr. J. W. Moir). An abstract of one year's

observations has been sent home through Mr. Scott Elliott.

   --Zoml>e, Xynsaland (Mr. J. Buchanan). Registers of the observations

made from June 1892 to March 1894 have been received. The abstract

--published in the Appendix has been prepared by Mr, Dickson.
      Lamharene, 0(jowe (Rev. C. Bonzon). Only one month's observations

liave been received.

   --Kibwezi, British East Africa (Scottish Mission). The instruments

were only granted this year. One year's rainfall observations have been

·received.

     Warri, Benin (Capt. Gallwey). --The registers have been received up

io the date. An abstract has been prepared by Mr. Dickson.

     The sets at all these stations, with the exception of Warri, include a
imercurial barometer, four thermometers, and a rain-gauge. That at
Warri includes a black bulb thermometer.

      Meteorological reports from thirteen stations in British East Africa
have been received. These stations lie on or near the coast, between

Wasin and the Jub, and along the road connecting Mombasa with Fort
Smith in Kikuyu, the climate of which is described as being exceptionally

well suited to European residents. These observations were, in most
instances, made by officials of the Imperial British East Africa Company.
The abstracts have been prepared by the ChaiT-man. (See Map, p. 491.)

     Your Committee i-egret that the instructions laid down for tlie guid-
.ance of observers should, in many instances, have been set aside, and that
observations should have been made at hours precluding the possibility of
deducing trustworthy means. Where circumstances do not admit of the

-- --instruments being read thrice daily at 7 a.m., 2 p.m., and 9 p.m. the

itliermometers should be read at 9 a.m., or twice daily, at an interval of

twelve hours. Tlie barometers, however, should be read at intervals of

--.sf-x hours say at 9 a.m. and at 3 p.m.

     Your Committee have expended the bl. granted. They beg to propose
that they be reappointed, and that a grant be made of 10^., which would
enable them to establish a station near Lake Ngami.

abundance of water lying either in stagnant pools or procurable by sinking
.shallow wells. It is capable of producing almost anything : cocoanut palms
grow in clusters along its whole length ; cotton, indigo, tobacco, plantains,
jowari ; and in the gardens papyas, mulberries, lemons, oranges, and
chillis grow profusely. The inhabitants of the villages scattered along
the coast are for Arabia particularly prosperous ; they are governed by a
representative from the Sultan of Oman, who has of late years been
successful in establishing peace. Behind this rich plain is a range of
mountains, known as the Gara range, rising to about 3,000 feet above the
.sea level. In the valleys sloping towards the Indian Ocean on the south,
and towards the desert of Nejd on the north, are found the various
frankincense districts where the frankincense tree, Boswellia Carteri, is
still found, and which constitutes an industry for the inhabitants, as it has
done for thousands of years. There are three chief districts where the

shrub grows, and the export of the gum is now about 9,000 cwt. per
annum, which is sent to Bombay in dhows. Myrrh is also found in

proximity to the frankincense tree, and in ancient days the commerce
in these odoriferous drugs gained for this district a world-wide reputation.

     The Gara hills are rounded and undulating, except on the coast side,
where the approach is precipitous and rugged ; they are of limestone
formation, and retain a surprising amount of moisture, which is at the
same time the cause of their fertility and the fertility of the plain of
Dhofar, which is an alluvial deposit from them. The valleys running into
these hills from the coast are of great fertility, containing a dense mass
of tropical vegetation, huge sycamores block up the valley, with cacti,
acacias, and numerous creepers ; in several places lodgments of
water have formed themselves into little lakes or tarns, an altogether
unknown condition of atfairs in any other part of Arabia. The mountain
sides are honeycombed with caves, in which the inhabitants dwell with
their flocks and herds. Right up to the summits of the Gara mountains

--the same condition of fertility is observable they are covered with grass

all over, and clusters of sycamores grow right up at the summit, giving to
them quite a parklike appearance ; and the flora of this district is very
extensive. Although we were thereduring the dry season we collected 260
different specimens of plants, as against 150 collected during a much longer
period and more extended area in the Hadramut last year. These plants
have now been deposited at Kew, and though more numerous they do not

contain so many new varieties as those from the Hadramut ; they establish
an extension westwaids of tlie Indian and Beloochistan flora, whereas
those of the Hadramut are more African in their character, tending to

prove by their geograpliical distribution that the floral line of demarcation
between Asia and Africa takes place somewhere between the Hadramut
and Dhofar.

     From the summit of the Gara ransfe an interesting view over the
frankincense country is obtained. To the north the hills slope down

towards the desert of Nejcl, which gradually destroys the vegetation, and
ends in a long blue horizon like the sea. To the east and west the same
characteristics are observable, and to the south the view is bounded by
the sea. The district of Dhofar owes its peculiar fertility to the water-
retaining qualities of its geological composition, and to the regularity of
its rainfalls, which occur from July to September, when the valleys are
turned into torrents, and even the Bedouins find it difficult to get about.

across a very curious natural phenomenon. The valley, which is liere about
a mile and a half broad, with hills on either side reaching an elevation of
about 2,000 feet, has been blocked up by a calcareous deposit, which has
collected round an isolated hill in the centre of the valley, and has formed
itself into a perfectly sheer and precipitous wall or abyss. To the east of

this hill the abyss is 5.50 feet high and three-quarters of a mile in
length. It is hung with white stalactites, and presents a whitish-grey
colour ; over this abyss small waterfalls precipitate themselves, and the
ground' below is spongy and fertile, and all along the river bed the rocks

are white with calcareous deposit. At the top of this abyss an exceedingly
fertile flat meadow extends for several miles inland, richly wooded, and
providing rich pasturage for the cattle of the Bedouins, who own it ; and

about a mile and a half from the abyss are two lakes joined together by a
meandering stream. They are long and narrow, but in places of consider-
able depth, and it is the overflow from these lakes which falls over the
abyss. Bulrushes, water plants, and water birds abound here, and the

spot is marvellously fertile.

     (2) The inhabitants of the Dhofar district may be divided into twa
distinct groups, namely, the Arab inhabitants of the coast villages whO'
cultivate the fertile plain, and occupy themselves in Ashing, and the nomad
Bedouins of tlie Gara tribe, who inhabit the mountains, and are purely

pastoral.

     The coast Arabs are chiefly from Oman, and are of the Ibadiyeh sect,

recognising the Sultan of Oman as the head of the church. This sect of
Mohammedans is much less fanatical than the others in Arabia, probably

from the long struggle they had with the "VVahabis of Nejd at the com-

mencement of this century. They off'ered no objection to our visiting their
mosques, and we were subjected whilst amongst them to none of that fanati-
cal hatred which caused us so mrch inconvenience during our sojourn in
the Hadramut last year. The mosques of the Ibadiyeh are small and with-

out minarets ; their heterodoxy consists in not accepting any of the Imams
who succeeded Mohammed, but they consider that the Imam or head of

the church is to be elected by the people as occasion requires.

      Eighteen years ago the Arabs in Dhofar were in a very sorry condition,

and sent to the Sultan of Oman to ask him for a governor : the blood feuds

between the tribes and the hostile attitude of the Bedouins rendering

existence almost intolerable. Sultan Tourki of Oman sent as Wall a

 trusted friend of his named Suleiman, who has been there nearly ever since,
 and by his wise rule and administrative power peace and a measure of
 prosperity have been restored amongst the Gara tribe. The Arabs them-

 selves never penetrate into the interior, but are content to cultivate the
 fertile plain of Dhofar, and inhabit the prosperous villages by the coast.

     The Bedouins of the Gara tribe, who are perhaps the wildest and most

 uncivilised of any of the tribes of the South of Arabia, form a most inter-

 esting study for the anthropologist. They are clearly an aboriginal race,
 as distinct from the Arab as the Spaniard is from the American Indian.
 They are small of stature and of limb, but exceedingly lithe and well made.
 They go about naked, save for a loin cloth, and wear their long tangled
 locks bound together by a leather thong. There are hardly any firearms

 amongst them, but every man carries with him tliree indispensable

--weapons his shield made of wood or sharkskin, with a knob at one end,

 which he turns round when tired, and uses as a stool ; his flat iron sword
 with a wooden handle ; and his throw stick, a wooden weapon pointed
--494 REPORT 1895.

 at both ends, which he uses with great skill both in war and in the

  chase.

       The Gara live chiefly, as stated above, in the deep caves of their
 limestone mountains, which provide accommodation for the family and
 many head of cattle. They have a large number of milch cows and
 goats, and make ghee in great quantities, which is exported from here.
 All their implements are of the most primitive description. The churn

 is a skin hung on three sticks which a woman shakes about until butter
 is formed ; to make their cows give milk freely they stretch a calf's skin

 on two sticks, and give this to the cow to lick. The calves and kids are

  kept in the innermost recesses of the caves during the absence of the clams

  at the pasturage.

      Camel breeding is also a great industry among the Gara Bedouins, and
 the animals are remarkably fine and healthy ; they have but little use for
 these camels, but they take them to great fairs and recognised rendez-
 vous of the Bedouins of the interior, and sell them. The camels are curious
 feedei-s, bone being greatly appreciated by them, also small dried fish and
 sections of a cactus which grows in the mountains. Some of the richer
 Bedouins own as many as seventy camels and 500 head of cattle ; they
' are, however, devoid of luxury, seldom constructing any habitation for
 themselves, and never using tents. In the wet season, when they come

 down to the plain of Dhofar for the pasturage, they erect as shelter for

 themselves round beehive huts of grass and reeds, but in the mountains
 they never require more than their ancestral caves, which are cool in the
 heat and dry in the rain, and the floors of which are springy and soft with

 the deposits of many generations of cattle.
      The Bedouins of the Gara mountains have many interesting customs :

 their greetings are very complicated and curious to watch. For an acquaint-
 ance they merely rub the palms of the hands when they meet, and then
 kiss the tips of their fingers ; for an intimate friend they join hands and
 kis^ each other ; for a relative they join hands, then rub noses, and finally

 kiss on either cheek.
      The Gara are great believers in the existence of Jinnis, or spirits, in

their mountains and streams. As we passed by a great rock one day they
 all set to work to sing the words ' Alaik Soubera,' which we were told
 was a request to the Jin to let us pass in safety. Again, at a lake we

 visited in the mountains they aflirmed their belief in the existence of Jinnis,
 stating that it is dangerous to wet your feet in the lake, or you will catch a
 fever. The Jinnis inhabit the caves, the trees, and the streams ; and at
 an annual festival and gathering of the various families into which the
 Gara tribe is divided, the great ceremony is the propitiating of the Jinni

of the lake by a magician who sits on a rock, and performs his incantations

 whilst the people dance around.

      They believe that the Jinnis when propitiated are very helpful to
mankind ; and inasmuch as they inhabit the lower heaven, thej'can overhear
 the conversation of the angels, and if disposed communicate their valuable
 secrets to man. This would seem to be almost the only ti-ace of religious
observance amongst the Gara Bedouin ; they may have others which we
were unable to ascertain, but one thing is certain, that though they may
conform to the dictates of Islamisra when visiting the Arab villages en
the coast, when up in the mountains they observe neither prayer nor ablu-
tion, nor any of the ceremonies inculcated by that creed. The Arabs
attribute to the Bedouins certain pagan rites, and they are probably cor-

   rect ; as in many otJier parts of the Mohammedan world it would seem

   that certain ancient cults and ceremonies have been retained, which the

   Moslem has been unable to eradicate.

       The Gara tribe is divided into families, the chief of which is the Al
   Kah tan family, and the head of the Al Kahtan family is recognised as the

   Sheikh by all the Garas. These families have constant blood feuds

   amongst each other, which they make up when war is on with their neigh-

   Ijours, the Mahri tribe, or the Geneveh tribe. Wali Suleiman during late

   years has done much to heal these feuds, and it was through his instru-

   mentality that we were enabled to penetrate into the Gara mountains,

   with an escort of the heads of the chief families, with comparative safety.

   (3) The archjeological interest in the plain of Dhofar centres chiefly in

   its connection with the frankincense trade and tlie towns established in

   ancient times along the coast by the merchants who provided the ancient

   world with the odoriferous drugs.

      We have several classical authorities who refer to this district, notably

   Claudius Ptolemy, the author of the ' Periplus of the Red Sea,' Pliny, and

   ;i few others. From them we can gather certain definite points, that

   beyond Pas Favtak and the Sachalites Sinus there stretched a fertile coast
   line known as the Libaniferous coast. The capital of this district was accord-

   ing to Ptolemy called the oracle of jWteinis (MoireToi' 'Ai>Tef.ucoi), and the

   city next in importance was called AhyssajwUs, near which was the harbour,

   the 'portus nobilis, or Moscha of the Periplus, where the merchants on their
   way to and from India used to tarry during the violence of the monsoons.

   Along the whole line of the plain of Dhofar there are no less than

   seven spots where ruins occur, all indicating towns of considerable size but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

   on close examination of all of them there can be no manner of doubt that

   --at Al Balad and Robat which are about two miles from one another and
   --connected by a series of ruins the capital stood. These places are close

   to the coast, and nearly in the centre of the line of plain, and consist of the

   remains of many temples, tombs, and public buildings. The acropolis is
   well marked with the debris of buildings ; there is also a tiny little harbour,

   evidently only for small craft, across which a chain was discovered, the

   Arabs say, a few years ago. Then there is a moat round the outer edge

   of this town, in which water is still found, and bulrushes. The columns

   still standing form an interesting link, which connects these ruins archi-

   tecturally with the other ruined sites of the Sabsean world ; they are square

   Aand fluted at each corner, and with step-like capitals. further development

   of this is evidently of later origin, when they decorated the capitals with
   floral and geometric devices. The columns at Axsum in Abyssinia, at
   Ivoloe and Adulis on the coast of the Red Sea, and at Mariaba in Yemen

   are all of the same character, and indubitably establish the Saba?an origin

   of the ruins. One column at Robat we found with a capital decorated on

   four sides, three sides with intricate geometric patterns, and the fourth with

   T Nothe Sabftan letters ein and alternately.  other ruins either in size

   or architecture on the plains of Dhofar can compare with these, and we

   can safely say that they formed the capital of the district, which Claudius

Ptolemy calls the oracle of Artemis (MoireTo)' 'Anref.uSoc:), and which in

later times was known as Mansura, where dwelt, Yakout tells us, the
Prince of Dhofar, who had a monopoly over the frankincense trade, and

   punished the infringement of it with death. In later times the Persians

occupied this spot, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries of our era. To
them we owe the fact of the disturbance of the old Sabtean columns, and
--496 REPORT 1895.

the utilising of them to erect mosques, many of which are now standing

in a fair state of pi-eservation.

   We tried to find the site of the oracle of which Ptolemy S23eaks, but

could not come to a satisfactory spot until we visited the mountains, and
in the Wadi Nehaz, about 9 miles from the capital, just at the foot of the
mountains, we found a curious natural hole, about 150 feet deep and 50 feet
in diameter. Around this there was a wall of Saba?an origin which had a
massive gatepost, and in the immediate vicinity were traces of many
ruins. For several reasons I am inclined to believe that this is the site

of the oracle mentioned by Pcolemy. In the first place, the hole resembles
in character the site chosen for an oracle in the ancient world, bearing a
remarkable resemblance to the holes which existed in Cilicia, the oracles of
the Corycian and Olbian Zeus, and several other spots in Greece. Secondly,
Yakout tells us that the abode of the Adites was half a day's journey
from Mansura, the term Adites generally being given to the adherents of
the ancient cult ; and, thirdly, because there is no other spot on the plain
of Dhofar where one can say there is a probability of an oracle existing.

     Yakout further tells us that 20 parasangs from Mansura wns the ex-
cellent harbour, frequented by the crafts on the way to and from India, and
by merchants in search of frankincense. The author of the Pei'iplus refers
to this harbour, and calls it Moscha, and Ibn Khaldun also speaks of it as
Merbat. As we journeyed along the coast we were constantly on the
look out for this harbour, and on the second day, after leaving the ruins
of the capital, we reached the village of Takha, in the vicinity of which
are traces of many ruins scattei'ed about, but inferior in architecture to
those at Al Balad. Next morning we were conducted by the natives
round a headland, and there saw a long sheet of water stretching inland,
but silted up at the mouth by a sxnd belt, over which the sea flows at high
tide. This same sand belt now separates from the shore a rocky island
with traces of fortifications on it. There can be no doubt but that this is
the harbour, and the island rock guarded the double entrance to it before
the invasion of the sand. The harbour is deep, and extends inland about
a mile and a half, and there are many ruins around it. Here we have
the partus nohilis of the Periplus, the harljour to which the frankincense
merchants came, and it is, as Yakout tells us, just 20 parasangs from the
capital. The term Moscha, given to it in the Periplus, is a common term
goiven to bays and inlets on the AraVjian coast. Merbat, the name given
it by Arabian writers, is still retained in the headland 12 miles east,
where Arab dhows find a shelter during the north-east monsoons, but
it afTords no other harbourage, and Ptolemy's name for this place is
Abyssapolis, a name which I consider to be derived from the great abyss
which I have already described as existing a few miles inland, and which
must have been a conspicuous and well-known object to all merchants
who frequented this port. Ptolemy, as it will be seen fi'om the name
given to the capital, gave Greek names, or equivalents, to the places on
this coast, and in naming this place he evidently used the most con-
spicuous object in its vicinity. Thus we were able to recon.struct on fairly
probable lines the geographical features of this frankincense district, and

fix the position of the sites of its towns.

       of a Committee^! consisting 0/ Professor A. B. W. Kennedy, F.R.S.

        (Chairman), Professor J. A. Ewing, F.R.S. , Professor D. S.

       Capper, Professor T. H. Beare, and Professor W. C. Unwin,

        F.B.S. {Secretary'). (Drawn itp by the Secretary.)

   At the first meeting of the Committee it was decided to investigate

   initially the accuracy of instruments for measuring the tension coefficient

   Aof elasticity, or Young's Modulus.     general letter was addressed to

   various professors and others in charge of engineering laboratories inviting

   co-operation. Most of those written to agreed to make a series of measure-

   ments for discussion by the Committee.

   It was then decided' that sets of standard test bars should be prepared,

   to be subjected to tension and measurement. Figs. 1, 2 show the forms

   of test bar decided upon. Two of the standard bars of each set are cylin-

   drical bars, with screwed ends of about 1^-inch and f^-inch diameter.

   These have gauge points for measuring instruments, suitable for extenso-

   meters of 8-inch, 10-inch, 16-inch, or 20-inch range. These bars are of

   a special steel of high tenacity, rolled specially for the Committee by the

   Blaenavon Company. The whole of the bars were cut from a single

   rolled bar about 20 feet in length, and were very accurately turned to the

   required dimensions by Mr. W. R. Munro. The third bar of each set was

   a flat bar, of section about 2 inches by ^ inch, of mild steel. All these
   bars were cut from a single plate, and they were prepared with gauge

   points at 8 inches and 10 inches.

   In order to obtain some preliminary information as to the mechanical

   properties of the standard bars, one round bar and one flat bar were

   tested in the testing machine at the Central Technical College. The

   following table gives the results obtained :

Committee. The measurements have taken much time, and the whole
oi. the reports of observers have not yet been received. Some of those

ah-eady sent reached the Committee too late for discussion this year. It
appears, therefore, to the Committee that it is unavoidable that only an
interim report can be presented this year. The Committee ask for re-

appointment, in order that the results obtained may be discussed and

presented.

     It may, however, be useful even at this stage, to give a very short

summary of some of the results sent in. The following table gives a
summary of the measurements of the standard bars by different observers.
It will l)e seen that there is an appreciable difference even in the measure-
ment of the dimensions of the same bar. The fiat bar, it may be noted,
was machined on the edges only.

kinds, the upper part of which is a subaerial deposit, which varies in

thickness from an inch or two up to four feet. Below this is the midden

material, composed of all sorts of the waste products of life. It is usually

·only a few inches in thickness, but occasionally it is eighteen inches thick.

It is much darker than the adjacent material, owing to the large quantity

of charcoal and other carbonaceous matter contained in it. Frequently

there are hearths which occur on old surfaces, where the material has been

burnt to a red-brick mass, extending downwards from half an inch to

three inches ; in wet weather this is very friable and rotten. In places
there are seams of shells : the most extensive layers consist of those of

tnussels and oysters, which ai'e in the woi'st state of preservation. Limpets

are almost as plentiful, but better preserved than the former. Winkles are
very abundant, and always of very large size. Buccinum undatum is

fairly plentiful, but Trophon is absent. Cardium echinatuin is frequently

found, but no trace of C. edule has been observed. The occurrence of Pur-

2mra lapilhis is curious. Some pieces of bone have recently been discovered

stained of a purple colour, which would suggest a knowledge of the dye

furnished by this species. Pecten opercidaris, Natica, and Mactra also

occurred, while in one place a heap of snail-shells of a very large size

was found : these are probably Helix aspersa, but the shells are larger and
more globose than those of the existing species, and the light-brown bands

·of colour that are left make the species to resemble //. pomatia. There

is also a large quantity of fish-bones distributed through the material,

:Sonie of which bear traces of roasting : they include skate, gurnard, cod,

whiting, mackerel, sole, turbot, and plaice. Large quantities of other

bones formed part of the material ; they are always detached, and bones
are never found together in the natural position ; frequently they show
the action of fire, and all the marrow-bones are split. In two cases a

split bone was discovered with a flint wedge still iyi situ. The bones

include those of frog, ducks, some species of gull, red and black grouse,

and other species of birds not yet determined ; rabbit, pig, horse, sheep,

goat, red deer, roe, ox, badger, fox, wolf, dog.

     Fragments of pottery abound occasionally ; it is possible to restore
about a third part of a vessel, from which its nature and shape can be

determined. They are all of domestic patterns (iiot burial), flat-bottomed,

and they usually have a deposit of soot upon them. Some appear to be very

coarse and sun-dried, but the majority are well-baked and hand-made.

They vary in colour from a discoloured dirty red to black, the latter pre-

·dominating. They ai-e, on the average, of good neolithic quality.

Large quantities of flint bouldei-s appear to have been taken up for

implement-making.  All  the  implements  are      small                              no axe or war

implement has been discovered. Many hundreds of flakes show signs of

·wear, and these sometimes reach five inches in length. Round and

hollow scrapers abound, from a very large size down to needle-makers, as

<do all kinds of drills. None of the arrow or lance heads are barbed, but
they are often very symmetrically worked to a lanceolate shape. The

commonest form is a nicely worked lanceolate-shaped flake, single or

double ridged, generally the latter, with a well-formed butt, with or

·without secondary work on the edges. The butt ends of hundreds of

these have been found, the points excessively rarely. There is, however,

a still more interesting gi-oup of implements than any of the foregoing,

owing to their diminutive size, their peculiar outlines, and delicate work

implements in every way similar to those which have been found in
502 REPORT-- 1 895.

India, Egypt, the South of Spain, and Belgium abroad, while in this
country they have been recorded from N.E. Lancashire, Warren Hill,
Hastings, and Sevenoaks. They consist of crescents, triangles, trapezoids,
and other forms. They are sometimes only five-eighths of an inch in
length, and rarely exceed one and a half inch. The flakes removed in
their manufacture are often only an eightieth of an inch in width.

   A more systematic method of working was adopted during the month

of August of this year, adding a vast amount of new material which has
yet to be examined, and more work remains to be done. In spite of the
vigilance of those in charge, visitors dig into the cliff, and so expose the
midden material to the action of the heavy rains, by which it is washed
away and lost.

     The best thanks of the Committee are due to the Mayor and Corpora-

tion of Hastings for the interest they have taken in the subject, and also

for the permission given to excavate ; and to the Rev. W. C. Sayer-

Milward, whose permission to excaveite was also necessary.

          A Remarkable Barroiv at the Wildernesse, Sevenoaks, Kent.

      This barrow is situated near a Neolithic settlement on the property of
Lord Hillingdon at Sevenoaks.

     The bed-rock of the district belongs to the Folkestone beds, and is
usually of a deep iron-stained colour. Upon this was deposited a layer of
siliceous ironstone, which apparently served as a hearth, then a layer of
black carbonaceous unctuous material, through which are distributed frag-
ments of charcoal and small particles of burned bone. This is followed
by a layer of calcined flints, all of which appear to have been worked ; but
the heat applied was so intense that all the flints are in fragments, and

the edges are frequently fused. It is possible, however, to restore imple-

ments from fragments found close together. These layers were covered by
and enclosed in another black carbonaceous layer, in which occur fairly
large pieces of charcoal. Next comes another layer of ironstone. This is
followed by a layer of white sand : profusely distributed through these are

large quantities of flint implements, flakes, &c. This is a foot in thickness

near the centre, where the whole of the flints show signs of burning. The

latest excavations disclose the lateral extension of the white layer till it is

met by the overlying 4 ft. 6 in. of sand.
     The barrow is round in form, about 90 feet in diameter, and 5 ft. 6 in.

high.

     The implements are in every way identical with those found on the
adjoining settlement and at the Hastings Kitchen Middens. There are
more horseshoe-shaped scrapers than at Hastings, where the scrapers

are nearly all spatulate in form ; but all the curiously shaped, diminutive
crescents, triangles, trapezoids, &c., are also found at Sevenoaks ; in fact,
it is impossible to distinguish between them.

     No metal was found in the barrow except a brass-covered iron bell in

the top material. The Rev. Canon Greenwell is of the opinion that this
barrow is quite unique.

     The barrow has now been filled in again.
     The Committee propose to spend the small balance in hand upon the

Kitchen Middens on Castle Hill. There are others on the East Hill
which would also repay working. These middens are intimately associated
with the remarkable St. Clement's Caves, and an investigation of them^
might possibly throw a flood of light upon the unknown origin of these,

structures.

During the past year it has not been deemed advisable to issue any-
further circular, and the work done has been confined to forwarding copies
of the instructions printed with last year's report and advising school-
masters, medical men, and others as to the taking up and carrying
on of physical measurements in the institutions with which they are

connected.

     From the number of communications which have reached the Secre-
tary, it is evident that considerable interest has been awakened in the

measurements (by Dr. Lancelot Andrewes) which have been carried out
under its instructions has recently been forwarded to the Secretary. The
Committee ask for reappointment for another year without further grant,
the balance of that for 1894-95 being expected to suffice for the ensuing

twelvemonth.

            seen and numbers noted

The Committee, acting in conjunction with a committee appointed for
the same purpose by the International Congress of Hygiene and Demo-

graphy (1891), in presenting their third report are able to give a further
account of the 50,000 children seen individually during the years

1892-94.

     The methods of observation and the points observed were fully de-

scribed in our first report. Analysis of the points observed in each child
afibrds material for the arrangement of groups of cases, prepared by esta-
blished actuarial processes, their distribution, and their co-relations, and
enables us to give results of scientific interest and importance, and also to

give evidence on questions concerning the education of children and their

control by the State.

   We proceed to give the results of research among the 8,941 cases

(boys 5,112, girls 3,829) of whom notes were taken as to the points in

which they were below the average in bodily or mental status.

    As a step towards ascertaining the causation of defects, and the
most probable means of removing them, we have arranged the children
                                                                        ;

in twelve groups of schools presented in Table I., which gives the
' numbers seen ' and ' the numbers noted ' in each group of schools respec-
tively, and the special defects they presented. It is thus possible to

ascertain the relative frequency of each defect among the boys and girls
of the nationalities and social classes, (fee.

    The numbers of cases presenting individual defects, when distributed
among the nationalities and social classes, itc, are comparatively small

for the general purposes of research it appears more satisfactory to deal
with groups of cases presenting the main classes of defects. JFor this
reason the Committee have bestowed much labour on preparing a general

but exact analysis of the facts in hand, dealing principally with the distri-
bution and co-relations of the main classes of defects, leaving for future

work the study of similar relations among the individual signs in such

classes.

     There are four main classes or divisions into which the defective con-

ditions observed may be grouped.

   --A. Defects in development of the body and its parts in size, form, or

proportioning of parts.

B. Abnormal ne^'ve-signs : certain abnormal actions, movements, and

balances.

--C. Loiv nutrition, as indicated by the child being thin, pale, or delicate.

D. Mental Dulness. The teacher's report as to mental ability was added

to the record of each child noted, and those stated to be backward or
below the avei'age in ability for school work were entered as 'dull.'

     The relative distribution of these classes of defects is shown in Table

II., which also gives the combinations in which they occur, and their per-
centages upon the numbers of chikh-en seen and the numbers noted. It is

by studying the distriljution and the co-relations of these groups that new

information is most readily obtained.

    Among the children who present some degree of defect those -are pro-

bably in best condition who present only 'one main class of defects,' while

those with four classes of defects are often so deficient as to need sjjecial
care and training. The numbers and percentages of these groups are also

given in Table II.

   A full statement of the facts observed has been prepared for early

publication by the committee with whom we are allied, which enables

us to make certain general statements upon which their report will afford

detailed evidence.

Defects in development of the body are more frequent among boys
-- Athan girls in the proportion of Sw to 6-8.
                                                marked exception to this

rule is in the cases of small cranium, which are much more frequent

among girls : this defect appears to some degree endemic in the

neighbourhoods of large buildings. It is less frequent among the

Irish children, who in other particulars present many noteworthy

points.

     Of the cases with defect in development (A), 16-2 per cent, of the boys
and 26--1 per cent, of the girls were pale, thin, or delicate ; and 38-4 per
cent, of the boys and 45-0 per cent, of the girls were reported as dull.

     These facts serve to illustrate the importance of presenting all vital

statistics separately for males and females. The greater harm that results
from defect of body among girls is shown by the fact that 65'3 per cent.

of the boys and 72*5 per cent, of the girls presented other conditions
of defectiveness. The evidence accumulated shows the importance of
           ON THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DEFECTS OF CHILDREN. 505

looking to the four main classes of defect in each case. It has not been
possible in our examinations conducted in schools to use anthropometric
methods to any extent, but new information has been supplied upon an
extended basis of observation as to the significance of deviations from the
normal proportioning of the bodily development.

      It has been fairly established by observation, independent of argu-
ments derived from other sources, that the ' nerve-signs ' recorded in this
investigation correspond to disordered brain conditions, such as produce
in their mental function dull and backw^ard children.

      Of cases with 'nerve-signs' 41 '5 per cent, of boys, 42-6 per cent, of
girls were reported as dull ; of development defect with ' nerve-signs,' 45"1
per cent, of boys, .31 -6 per cent, of girls, were reported as dull. Ill-pro-
portioned bodies with motor indications of disorderly or slowly acting

brains are very apt to be dull mentally. In these facts we find further
evidence of a physical basis of mental action and expression. The pro-
bability that the children reported by the teachers as dull were backward
children is indicated by the large proportion of them found to be over

age for the class or educational standard in which they had been placed

in school.

      In Table I. is given a class, ' G. Exceptional Children.' This includes
all children whose physical or mental conditions show them to be obviously
at a permanent disadvantage therefrom in social life. This group includes
idiots, imbeciles, ' children feebly gifted mentally ' ; children mentally
exceptional or deficient in moral sense ; epileptics and children M-ith

history of fits during school life ; dumb children and all children crippled,

deformed, maimed, or jmralysed. All these exceptional children need to
be considered individually : they form about 1'5 per cent, of the school

population.

     Reviewing the work of which we thus give a brief account, it may be

stated that the object has been to furnish a reliable statement of the

conditions observed among children seen in schools. The inquiry com-
menced in 1888, and 100,000 children in all have been examined and
reported on. The points worthy of note have been defined and

enumerated ; the children have been distributed in groups according to
the combinations of points they presented, and classified in other ways,
including special particulars as to the children with mental or other
deficiency, the numbers in each class being recorded. The methods of
reporting and preparing statistical statements have been carefully elabo-
rated and systematised.

     Information has from time to time been supplied to the Government
departments and other public bodies as to the provision needed for dull
and backward children ; the classification of children in schools providing

secondary education ; children in Poor Law schools and other institutions,

and on other important questions.
     It is hoped that the scientific classification of children and enumera-

tion of conditions existing among them will lead to the adoption of means
of social improvement, and we recommend the continuation of such

inquiries in other parts of the country.

     The Committee desire to be reappointed, and ask a grant in aid of
the work.

1. As in the two previous years, the Committee have had the advantage of

the co-operation of several gentlemen not members of the Association, but
delegates of various learned bodies who are interested in the Survey.
They have to deplore the loss, by death, of one of these gentlemen, Mr>
Granville Leveson-Gower, one of the delegates of the Society of Anti -
quaries. His place has been filled by the election by the same Society of
its Director, Mr. F. G. Hilton Price, as a delegate to tliis Committee.
His colleague, Mr. George Payne, and Mr. E. Clodd, Mr. G. L. Gomme^
and Mr. J. Jacobs, the representatives of the Folk Lore Society, Sir C..
M. Kennedy, K.C.M.G., representing the Royal Statistical Society^

Mr. Edward Laws, the Ven. Achdeacon Thomas, Mr. S. W. Williams*

and Professor John Rhys, representing the Cambrian Archffiological

Association, and Dr. C. R. Browne, a representative of the Royal Irish
Academy, have continued their valuable services. Some other members
of the Committee are delegated by the Anthropological Institute.

   ^2. In their first and second reports, the Committee presented a list of
367 villages or places which, in the opinion of competent persons con-
sulted by the Committee, appeared especially to deserve ethnographic-
study, and they appended to the list observations furnished by their cor-
respondents on the special characteristics of such villages and places,
which rendered them typical. This considerable number does not exhaust
the supply of names of places, several observations having been made in
places not mentioned in the list.

     3. The Committee have issued, in the shape of an octavo pamphlet of
twelve pages only, the forms of schedule which they liad prepared. They
believe that it presents, in the most compendious manner possible, a body

of instructions for observers under the five heads into which the Com-

mittee's inquiries have been divided, viz. :

(1) Physical types of the inhabitants
                                                                                                                                                        ;

(2)  Current traditions and beliefs
                                                                                                                    ;

(3) Peculiarities of dialect

(4)  Monuments  and other remains of ancient culture                                                                                                                     and
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

(5) Historical evidence as to continuity of race.

    Arrangements have been made with the printers for supplying this
pamphlet to Societies which may be desirous of circulating it amono- their

members or incorporating it with their Transactions, at a cost of 21s. for
--5l0 REPORT 1895.

every 400 copies, or IQs. if printed on the Society's own paper. [See

circular in Appendix.]

     4. This offer has been accepted by several societies. One of the societies
which have availed themselves of the arrangement is the Bristol and
Gloucestershire Archfeological Society, and Mr. Hartland has prepared
for insertion in its Transactions some notes explanatory of the Schedule,
a copy of which is appended to this report. The Committee propose to

arrange with the Society for a supply of copies of these notes, which may

be useful to societies and observers in other parts of the country.
     5. During the year the work of observation has been proceeding in

several directions, and the sub-committees in various parts of the United
Kingdom have commenced operations. The Committee do not propose
at the present stage to present any report of the results of these observa-
tions, but only to report progress and to request their reappointment for
the purpose of continuing the work with which they have been entrusted.

     6. They desire to make an exceiation, however, in the case of Ipswich,

which possesses local interest as being the place of meeting of the Asso-
ciation for the present year. Miss Layard has acted as secretary of a
sub-committee in Ipswich, and Dr. Hetherington has furnished twenty
measurements of individuals, a report upon which has been prepared by Dr.
Garson, 'and will be presented in a futui-e report. Dr. Groom e, Mr.
Partridge, and Mrs. Ledger have also contributed, thi'ough Miss Layard,
collections of the local Folklore, and these will also be contained in a

future report. By the courteous invitation of Mi-s. Cobbold, the Chair-
man and Secretary of the Committee attended a meeting at her house
for the purpose of explaining the views of the Committee, at which much

interest was expressed in the work of the Committee, and some valuable

information was obtained.
     7. Some interesting investigations have also been made by the Com-

mittee at Barley, in the county of Hertford. Their attention was drawn
by the Rector, the Rev. J. Frome Wilkinson, to the strong historical
evidence as to continuity of race furnished by entries in the parish
registers and other local records going back to an unusually early time,

to the existence of remains of ancient culture hitherto almost unnoticed
in the county histories, and to the survival to a late period of early forms

of land cultivation in this parish. By his courtesy, Professor Haddon,
who was accompanied by the Chairman of the Committee, was able to

take measurements and photographs of inhabitants of the parish belong-
ing to different ranks of society, whose pedigrees could be traced through

the registers for a considerable period.

   A8. Cambridge University sub-committee foi the Ethnographical

Survey of East Anglia has been formed to discover and record the
principal types of the inhabitants of East Anglia on the hues laid down
by this Committee, under the auspices of the Royal Society. This sub-

committee consists of Professor Macalister, F.R.S., Mr. W. L. H. Duck-

worth, and Professor Haddon, under whose supervision the work will be
conducted by a number of trained men. The work of forming sub-
committees in Wales has also been proceeded with. In the Cotteswolds,
Mr. S. S. Buckman has furnished the committee with notes introductory

to observations that are in progress.

     9. The Committee have been anxious to procure observations (especi-
ally physical observations) from places where the non-existence of any

local society or other reasons may interpose difficulties in the way of the
ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.  511

formation of a sub-committee. With this view, a circular has been
addressed to a selected number of medical men, whose names were obtained
from the lists of those who had contributed to the researches of the Col-

lective Investigation Committee of the British Medical Association. [See

Appendix.] As yet, howevei', the Committee have not been fortunate in

obtaining the favourable response to their application to these gentlemen
for which they had hoped.

     10. The Committee propose, at the close of the present meeting, to

arrange for a special survey of the district of Galloway, during the latter

part of September and the month of October 1895, with the view of
ascertaining the special divergencies in dialect, the prehistoric monuments,

the old cultivation sites, the folklore, the physical types of the people,

and objects of obsolete culture in domestic and agi-icultural occupations.
The Committee are glad to find that the Rev. Dr. Walter G regor, author
of ' Notes on the Folklore of the North-east of Scotland ' and other
works, is willing to undertake this survey. The expense is estimated at

not more than 20^.

    11. Should Dr. Gregor's time allow, they hope he maybe induced,

later in the year 1895-96, to undertake a similar survey in the districts
of Caithness, Morayshire, and Nairn.

     12. Only 10^. has been drawn in the past year out of the 30^. voted at
the Oxford meeting, although more has been expended. The Committee
ask for a renewal of the 201. not drawn, and for a further grant of SOL,

making 50^. altogether.

                              APPENDIX I.

                                         Circular to local Societies.

  --Dear Sir, I am instructed by the Ethnographical Survey Committee

to send you herewith a copy of the schedules prepared for the purpose of
the inquiry entrusted to them into the mental and physical characteristics
of the races of the United Kingdom. The heads of inquiry, as you will
see, ai'e very various ; and it is hoped that some at least of them will in-

terest the members of your Society. With the object of making them as
widely known as possible, the Committee have arranged with the pi'inters

(Messrs. Spottiswoode & Co., New Street Square, London, E.C.) to

supply copies to you, upon request, at the rate of 11. Is. for 400 copies, or,

if your own paper be used, 16s. By this means you will be enabled to

issue them with your transactions, or report, or to take any other means

which may appear more suitable to bring the subject under the notice of

all your members.

    You will observe that villages and retired places are spoken of in the

accompanying print as especially deserving of ethnogi'aphic study. The
object is to devote attention chiefly to the inhabitants of districts where
the population has long been stationary and little changed by the move-
ments of modern life. It is desired to obtain physical measurements and
photographs of individuals who appear typical in their respective districts,
individuals selected, if possible, from among those whose forefathers have
dwelt in the neighbourhood as far back as can be traced. With the phy-

sical peculiarities of the people it is desired to correlate their dialect, their

history as exhibited by archaeological remains, and their manners and
512 REPORT-- 1895.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,

customs, superstitions and other traditions comprehended under the con-
venient expression of Folklore.

     The inquiry has ah-eady been taken up with earnestness in some dis-
tricts, and valuable results have been obtained ; and the Committee think
that, when once its importance to the right understanding of the history
and characteristics of the races of these islands is fully appreciated, little
difficulty will be found in organising measures in every county for collect-
ing and collating the information. The report of a committee appointed
by a local society would not only be gratefully received by the Ethno-
graphical Survey Committee ; but it might also be embodied in the trans-
actions of the local society, and thus form a substantial contribution to
the history and archaeology of the county.

     The Committee will be pleased to arrange for the loan of a set of in-

struments, if desired, to any member of your Society who may undertake

the physical measurements. If the procuring of photographs be found to
involve expense beyond that which your Society is prepared to meet, the
Committee will be glad to be informed, in order that, if practicable, they

may make some contribution towards it. I may observe, however, that
many local societies are now undertaking a photographic survey of their

neighboui'hoods ; and where this is in progress the photographing of typical

inhabitants will not entail much additional labour or cost, while it will

add greatly to the value of the survey. I shall be obliged by your inform-

ing me what number of measurements of individuals you think your
Society may be able to obtain, so that the necessary copies of the form
may be sent.

                              APPENDIX II.

                                      Circular to Medical Men.

   --Dear Sir, I am desired by the Ethnographical Survey Committee of

the British Association to transmit to you herewith a copy of the forms,
of schedules that have been prepared for the purpose of the inquiry
entrusted to them into the physical and mental characteristics of the races

of the United Kingdom, and to express the hope that you may be able to

assist them by obtaining a series of the physical measurements of indi-
viduals who appear to you to be typical of the district in which you reside.
It is suggested that those individuals should be selected whose parents
and progenitors have lived in the district as far back as can be traced.

     You will observe that the desire of the Committee is to correlate the

physical racial peculiarities of the inhabitants of various districts with
their history as shown by archaeological remains, and with the manners
and customs, superstitions and other traditions, comprehended under the
convenient expression of Folklore. If your opportunities of observa-
tion should enable you, in addition, to fill up any of the schedules relating
to these branches of the inquiry, or if you should be in a position to induce

friends who have devoted attention to them to furnish the requisite
information, the Committee would be much indebted to you for so doing.

      The apology the Committee offer for asking assistance from so busy a

man as yourself, is that your contributions to the Collective Investigation

Committee of the British Medical Association have shown that you are

not unwilling to give valuable time to public service of this kind.
       ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. ' 513

I am to state that should you desire to make use of the instruments

adopted for these particular measurements, the Committee would be

pleased to arrange for the loan to you of a set. Probably, however, those

used by you in the ordinary course of your practice would be sufficient for

the purpose.

    I may add that the Committee think it desirable that any individual

measured should also be photographed. The instructions as to photographs

have been complained of  as somewhat minute                                                                                but their object is to per-

By E. Sidney Hartland, F.S.A., Secretary of the Committee.

The object of the Committee is to obtain a collection of authentic

information relative to the population of the British Islands, with a view

to determine as far as possible the racial elements of which it is composed.

The high interest of the inquiry for all archseologists need not be here

Ainsisted on.  satisfactory solution of the problems involved will mean

the re-writing of much of our early history ; and even if we can only gain

a partial insight into the real facts it will enable us to correct or to con-

firm many of the guesses in which historians have indulged upon data of

a very meagre and often delusive character.

The methods it is proposed to adopt have regard to the physical

peculiarities of the inhabitants, their mental idiosyncrasies, the material

remains of their ancient culture, and their external history. In modern

times great movements of population have taken place, the developments

of industry and commerce have brought together into large centres

natives of all parts of the country, and even foreigners, and thereby

caused the mingling of many elements previously disparate. These have

enormously complicated the difficulties of the inquiry. They have

rendered many districts unsuitable for every purpose except the record of

material remains. Scattered up and down the country, however, there

are hamlets and retired places where the population has remained

stationary and affected but little by the currents that have obliterated

their neighbours' landmarks. To such districts as these it is proposed to
direct attention. Where families have dwelt in the same village from

father to son as far back as their ancestry can be traced, where the modes

of life have diverged the least from those of ancient days, where pastoral

and agricultural occupations have been the mainstay of a scanty folk

from time immemorial, where custom and prejudice and superstition have

held men bound in chains which all the restlessness of the nineteenth

century has not yet completely severed, there we hope still to find sure

traces of the past.

     The photographic survey, which has been carried out so well at
Birmingham and elsewhere, and has been initiated in our own country,

will prove a most valuable aid to the wider work of the Ethnographical

Survey. Photographs of the material remains of ancient culture are

explicitly asked for in the schedule. In addition to them, photographs of

typical inhabitants are urgently desired. Some judgment will, of course,

require to be exercised in the selection of types, and a considerable

amount of tact in inducing the subjects to allow themselves to be taken.

It has been found effective for this purpose, as well as for that of

measuring the people, that two persons should go out together, and

setting up the camera in the village, or wherever they find a convenient

spot, coram poj^ulo, they should then proceed gravely to measure and

photograph one another. This will be found to interest the villagers,

and some of them will gradually be persuaded to submit to the operation.

A little geniality, and sometimes a more tangible gratification of a trifling

character, will hardly ever fail in accomplishing the object. The expe-
rience of observers who have taken measurements is that it becomes

exti'emely fascinating work as the collection increases and the results are

compared.'

This comparison, if the subjects have been selected with judgment,

and accurately measured and photographed, should enable us to determine

in what proportions the blood of the various races which have from time

to time invaded and occupied our soil has been transmitted to the present

population of different parts of the United Kingdom. From the ancient

remains in barrows and other sepulchral monuments, and from the study

of the living peoples of Western Europe, the characteristics of the races

in question are known with more or less certainty, and every year adds

Ato our information concerning them.  much more complex problem,

and one wherein archaeologists have a more direct interest, is how far the

culture of the races in question has descended to us, and how far it has

been affected by intruding arts, faiths, and inventions. To solve this,
appeal is made first to the historic and prehistoric monuments and other
material remains, and secondly to the traditions of many kinds that
linger among the peasantry. Here the first business, and that with

which the practical work of the survey is immediately concerned, is the
work of collection. To photograph, sketch, and accurately describe the

material remains ; to note and report the descriptions and drawings

already made, and where they are preserved ; to gather and put into
handy form the folklore of each country already printed ; and to collect

from the surviving depositaries of tradition that which may still be

--found namely, tales, sayings, customs, medical prescriptions, songs,

games, riddles, superstitions, and all those scraps of traditional lore stored

in rustic memories, impervious and strange to the newer lore of tp-day

these are the necessary preliminaries to the study of the civilisation of our

ancestors.

     ' The Ethnographical Survey Committee has a few sets of instruments for taking
the measurements, which can be placed temporarily at the disposal of the local
committee. Perhaps I may here also express the opinion that if the personal
photographs and measurements called for expenditure beyond what could be met by
local enthusiasm, the Committee might not be indisposed to contribute by way of a
small payment for each photograph and set of measurements.
ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.     515

     Archaeologists have paid too exclusive attention to the mateiial

remains. They have forgotten to inquire what light may be thrown
upon them by tradition. By the term tradition I do not mean simply

what the people say about the monuments. Antiquaries soon found out
that that was always inaccurate, and often utterly false and misleading.

Hence thay have been too much inclined to despise all traditions. But

tradition in the wide sense of the ivlbole body of the lore of the uneducated,
their customs as well as their beliefs, their doings as well as their sayings,

has proved, when scientifically studied, of the greatest value for the
explanation of much that we must fail to understand in the material
remains of antiquity. To take a very simple instance : when we find in

Gloucestershire barrows, cups, or bowls of rough pottery buried with the

dead, we call them food- vessels, because we know that it is the custom
among savage and barbarous nations to bury food with the dead and to

make offerings at the tomb, and that this custom rests on a persuasion
that the dead continue to need food and that they will be propitiated by
gifts ; and we further infer that the races who buried food- vessels with

their dead in this country held a similar opinion. Or, to take another
burial custom : General Pitt-Rivers reported last year to the British As-
sociation that he had found in excavations at Cranborne Chase bodies

buried without the head. If we were ignorant of the practices of other
races we should be at a loss to account for such interments. As it is, we

ask ourselves whether these bodies are those of strangers whose heads have

been sent back to their own land, or their own tribe, in order to be united
in one general cemetery with their own people ; or whether the heads

were cut off and preserved by their immediate relatives and brought into

the circle at their festive gatherings to share the periodical solemnities of

the clan. Both these are savage modes of dealing with the dead, one of

which, indeed, left traces in Roman civilisation at its highest development.

The knowledge of them puts us upon inquiry as to other burials of the

prehistoric inhabitants of this country, which may help us in reconstruct-

ing their worship and their creed. I for one do not despair of recovering,
by careful comparison of the relics preserved to us in the ancient monu-

ments with the folklore of the existing peasantry and of races in other

parts of the earth, at least the outlines of the beliefs of our remote

predecessors.

Any such conclusions, however, must be founded on the essential unity

that science has, during the last thirty years, unveiled to us in human

thought and human institutions. This unity has disguised itself in forms

as diverse as the nationalities of men. And when we have succeeded in

piecing together the skeleton of our predecessors' civilisation, material and

intellectual, we are confronted by the further inquiries : What were the

Howspecific distinctions of their culture ? and  was it influenced by those

of their neighbours or of their conquerors 1 This is a question only to be

determined, if at all, by the examination of the folklore of the country.

We may assume that the physical measurements, descriptions, and por-

traits of the present inhabitants will establish our relationship to some of

the peoples whose remains we find beneath our feet. And it will be

reasonable to believe that, though there has been a communication from

other peoples of their traditions, yet that the broad foundation of our folk-

lore is derived from our foreathers and predecessors in our own land. In
Gloucestershire itself we have strong evidence of the persistence of tradi-

tion. Bisley Church is said to have been originally intended to be built

                                                                                                                             LL2

several miles oflf, ' but the Devil every night removed the stones, and the
architect was obliged at last to build it where it now stands.' This is, of
course, a common tradition. The peculiarity of the case is that at Bisley
its meaning has been discovered. The spot where, we are told, ' the

church ought to have been buUt was occupied formerly by a Roman villa ;
and when the church was restored some years ago ' portions of the mate-

rials of that villa were found embedded in the church walls, including the
 altars of the Penates, which are now, however, removed to the British
Museum.' ^ Here, as Sir John Dorington said, addressing this Society
some years ago at Stroud, is a tradition which has been handed down for

fifteen or sixteen hundred years. This is in our own country, and it may

be thought hard to beat such a record. But at Mold, in Flintshire, there
is evidence of a tradition which must have been handed down from the

--prehistoric iron age that is to say, for more than two thousand years.

A cairn stood there, called the Bryn-yr-Ellyllon, the Hill of the Fairies.

It was believed to be haunted ; a spectre clad in golden armour had been

seen to enter it. That this story was current before the mound was
opened is a fact beyond dispute. In 1832 the cairn was explored. Three
hundred cartloads of stones were removed, and beneath them was found a

skeleton ' laid at full length, wearing a corslet of beautifully wrought
gold, which had been placed on a lining of bronze.' The corslet in ques-
tion is of Etruscan workmanship, and is now, I believe, to be seen in the
British Museum.^

   -- --Examples like these and they stand by no means alone inspire con-

fidence in the permanence of what seems so fleeting and evanescent. Folk-

lore is, in fact, like pottery, the most delicate, the most fragile of human

productions : yet it is precisely these productions which prove more dur-
able than solid and substantial fabrics, and outlast the wreck of empires,
a witness to the latest posterity of the culture of earlier and ruder

times.

     But if these traditions have thus been preserved for centuries and even

-- --millenniums, they have been modified nay, transformed in the process.

It is not the bare fact which has been transmitted from generation to

generation, but the fact seen through the distorting medium of the popu-
lar imagination. This is a characteristic of all merely oral records of an

actual event ; and this it is which everywhere renders tradition, taken
literally, so untrustworthy, so misleading a witness to fact. The same
law, however, does not apply to every species of tradition. Some species
fall within the lines of the popular imagination ; and it is then not a dis-

torting but a conservative force. The essential identity of so many stories,

customs and superstitions throughout the world is a sufficient proof of this,
on which I have no space to dwell. But their essential identity is over-
laid with external differences due to local surroundings, racial peculiari-
ties, higher or lower planes of civilisation. There is a charming story told

in South Wales of a lady who came out of a lake at the foot of one of the

Carmarthenshire mountains and married a youth in the neighbourhood,

and who afterwards, offended with her husband, quitted his dwelling for

ever and returned to her watery abode. In the Shetland Islands the tale

Ais told of a seal which cast its skin and appeared as a woman.  man of

the Isle of Unst possessed himself of the seal-skin and thus captured and

married her. She lived with him until one day she recovered the skin,

resumed her seal-shape and plunged into the sea, never more to return.

In Croatia the damsel is a wolf whose wolf-skin a soldier steals. In the

Arabian Nights she is a, jinn wearing the feather-plumage of a bird, appa-

rently assumed simply for the purpose of flight. In all these cases the

variations are produced by causes easily assigned.

The specific distinctions of a nation's culture are not necessarily limited

to changes of traditions which it may have borrowed from its neighbours

or inherited from a common stock. It may conceivably develop traditions

peculiar to itself. Tliis is a subject hardly yet investigated by students

of folkloi'e. Their labours have hitherto been chiefly conlliied to estab-

lishing the identity underlying divergent forms of tradition and explaining

the meaning of practices and beliefs by comparison of the folklore of dis-

tant races at different stages of evolution. But there are not wanting

those who are turning their attention to a province as yet unconquered,

and indeed almost undiscovered. Even if they only succeed in esta-

blishing a negative, if they show that all traditions supposed to be

peculiar have counterparts elsewhere, they will have rendered a signal

service to science, and produced incontrovertible testimony of the unity

of the human mind and the unintermittent force of the laws which

govern it.

Alike for the purpose of ascertaining the specific distinctions of culture

and the influences of neighbouring nations and neighbouring civilisations,

an accumulation of facts is the prime requisite. If we have reason to

believe in the persistence of tradition, we shall have confidence that relics

will be discovered in our midst of the faith and institutions of our remoter

ancestors ; and, in accordance as we venerate antiquity or desire to pre-
serve what remains of the past, we shall hasten to collect them. Nor can
we be too quick in so doing. The blood of our forefathers is a permanent

inheritance, which it would take many generations and a large interming-

ling of foreigners seriously to dilute, much less to destroy. But tradition

is rapidly dying. It is dwindling away before the influences of modern

civilisation. Formerly, when the rural districts were isolated, when news

travelled slowly and nobody thought of leaving his home save to go to the

nearest market, and that not too often, when education did not exist for

the peasantry and the landowners had scarcely more than a bowing ac-

quaintance with it, the talk by the fireside on winter evenings was of the

--business of the day the tilling, the crops, the kine. Or it was the gossip

and small scandals interesting to such a community, or reminiscences by

the elders of the past. Thence it would easily glide into tales and super-

stitions. And we know that these tales and superstitions were, in fact,

the staple of conversation among our fathers and generally throughout the

West of Europe, to go no further afield, down to a very recent period

and they still are in many districts. In England, however, railways,

newspapers, elementary education, politics, and the industrial movements

which have developed during the present century have changed the ancient

modes of life ; and the old traditions are fading out of memory. The
generation that held them is fast passing away. The younger generation

has never cared to learn them ; though, of course, many of the minor

superstitions and sayings have still a considerable measure of power, espe-

cially in the shape of folk-medicine and prescriptions for luck. "We must
 518 BEPORT--1895.

 make haste, therefore, if we desire to add to the scanty information on

 record concerning English folklore.

      As a starting-point for the collection of Gloucestershire folklore I put

 together, a year or two ago, the folklore in Atkyns, Rudder, and the first
 four volumes of Gloucestershire Notes and Queries ; and it was printed by
 the Folklore Society and issued as a pamphlet. · Other works remain to

 be searched ; and it is probable that a good deal more may be found already
 in print, if some who are interested in the antiquities of the country will

 undertake the not very arduous, but very necessary, labour of collection.

 When all is gathered, however, it will only be a small part of what must

--have existed at no distant date if not of what still exists, awaiting dili-

gent inquiiy among living men and women. How to set about the in-

 quiry is a question that must be left very much to the individual inquirer
 to answer. Valuable practical hints are given in the Handbook of Folklore,
a small volume that may be bought for half-a-crown and carried in the
pocket. Confidence between the collector and those from whom he is
seeking information is the prime necessity. Keep your notebook far in
the background, and beware of letting the peasant know the object

of your curiosity, or even of allowing him to see that you are curious.
Above all, avoid leading questions. If you are looking for tales, tell

a tale yourself. Do anything to establish a feeling of friendly sym-

--pathy. Never laugh at your friend's superstitions not even if he laugh

at them himself ; for he will not open his heart to you if he suspect you of

despising them.
      There is one other division of the schedule to which I have not yet

referred. The Dialect is perishing as rapidly as the folklore ; it is being
overwhelmed by the same foes. Peculiarities of dialect are due partly to
physical, partly to mental, causes. From either point of view they are of
interest to the investigator of antiquities. Hence their inclusion among
the subjects of the Ethnographical Survey. Nobody who has once under-
stood how much of history is often wrapped up in a single word can fail

to perceive the importance of a study of dialect, or how largely it may

contribute to the determination of the origin of a given population. The

reduction of dialect into writing requires accuracy to distinguish the nice-

ties of pronunciation, and some practice to set them down ; but a little

experience will overcome most difficulties, which, after all, are not great.

--It is believed that most of the words as distinguished from their pronun-

--ciation in use have been recorded in the publications of the English

Dialect Society or elsewhere. But it is better to record them again than
to leave them unrecorded. Nor should it be forgotten in this connection
that a word often bears a different shade of meaning in one place from what
it bears in another. In recording any words, care should therefore be taken

to seize not only the exact sound, but the exact signification, if it be desired

to make a real contribution towards the history of the country, or the
history of the language. Of the method of collection and transcription it
is needless to add to the directions in the schedule.

THE LAKE VILLAGE AT GLASTONBURY.                                        519

--The Lake Village at Glastonbury. Second Report of the Committee, con-

    sisting of Br. K. MuNKO (Chairman), Professor W. Boyd Dawkixs,

     Sir John Evans, General Pitt-Rivers, and Mr. A. Bulleid
     {Secretary). (Brawn up by the Chairman and the Secretary.)

I. Report. By Dr. R. Munro.

The site of the Lake Village at Glastonbury occupies some three or four
acres of a flat meadow, within the boundaries of what is supposed, on

good grounds, to have been formerly a lake or marsh. Before excavations

were begun all that the eye could discern on the undisturbed surface

were sixty or seventy low mounds huddled in the corner of a field. Only

about one half of these mounds has as yet been systematically explored,
but, so far, the original surmise that each mound formed the site of a hut,

resting on a substratum of beams and brushwood, is entirely confirmed.

The operations of the last two summers have been largely confined to

tracing the village border, which has now been uncovered to the extent
Aof about two-thirds of its circumference.
                                            vast amount of the hetero-

geneous debris of human occupancy has been gathered on and around its

site, including five complete skulls and other bones of man. These skulls

were found outside the stockaded margin, and it has been remarked that

no other bones of the body were associated with them. One of them

shows a deep cut, as if made by a sword, and another bears evidence of

having been supported on a spearhead, which had been inserted vertically
Athrough the first cervical vertebra and the occipital foramen.
                                                                        full

account of the technique and purposes of these relics and a list of the

flora and fauna collected during the excavations are given in the previous

report and in a small guide-book lately published by the Glastonbury

Antiquaria.n Society. Suflice it for the present to say that the relics are

--of various materials stone, flint, bronze, iron, bone, horn, glass, pottery,

&c. Among the bronze objects are many fibulse of La Tene forms, spiral

finger-rings, penanular brooches, and an elegant bowl. Of bone and horn

we have needles, pins, handles, long-handled combs used for wearing, and

many other articles. Among the objects of wood are a canoe, the frame-

work of a loom, the staves of buckets, one of which is decorated, part of

the axle of a wheel with a couple of spokes in their place. The pottery

is very abundant, and often highly ornamented with devices which

unmistakably show ' late Celtic ' art. Many of the industrial relics

exhibit some of the special characteristics of this style of art, the

importation of which into Britain preceded, by two or three centuries,

the occupation of the island by the Romans ; nor does it appear that any
of them had been influenced by Roman art. This, indeed, is one of the

most interesting features of the Glastonbury find, and this collection of

antiquities cannot fail to shed an unexpected light on one of the obscurest

periods of British civilisation within prehistoric times. On a previous

visit to Glastonbury I observed a leaden weight, shaped like a cheese,

having the middle of the rim bulging out It weighs 4 oz. 229 gr. This

is the only metallic article hitherto found of which there may be enter-
tained a suspicion that it had a Roman origin. I understand that Sir

Augustus W. Franks has pointed out a piece of pottery recently found

which may also have a similar origin. This shows that the village existed

as an inhabited place up to Roman times, and it is possible that it was

the intrusion of the Romans into this district which put an end to it.

    II. Reiwrt on the Work carried on dewing the Past Year.

                          By Arthur Bulleid.

    The digging at the Glastonbury Lake Village was discontinued last

year in October, and resumed this season towards the end of April. Since

presenting the report of the third year's exploration at the Oxford meet-
ing of the Association, 1-5 dwelling mounds have been examined, making,

with those previously laid open, 30 in all. Besides the 15 dwelling

mounds, 500 feet of the palisading, forming the west border of the village,

has been traced, together with from 15 to 25 feet of peat adjoining and
outside it. This, with the like distance of 500 feet dug in 1893-94, com-

pletes the examination of about two-thirds of the total circumference of

the village, the remaining unexplored portions of the palisading being

situated at the north and south sides. Of the original 65 dwelling mounds

there still remain about one-half for future examination, as well as the
large spaces of ground between them. The palisading examined this
year, bordering the west side of the village, was similar to that exposed

in previous years, both with reference to the arrangement of the piles

and the irregularity of outline, but it was not so strongly made as that on
the east side. At one spot, bordering a space between two dwellings,
the palisading was discontinued for 60 feet, and a bank of peat substi-

tuted for it ; the peat wall was kept in place by a single line of upright
piles driven down near its centre, the upper parts of the posts being

evidently bound together with hurdle work. During the examination of

the dwelling mounds the following structural discoveries were made.
With reference to the construction of the floors it was noticed that

the clay was covered with planks of split timber, and that the method

of  arranging the  wood  varied  in  different dwellings                                                                                                        in  two  floors
                                                                                                                                                             ;

the planks were placed in a circular fashion round the hearth,

and parallel to the wall of the house. On another floor the boards

were lying diagonally across the dwelling in a south-east and north-

west direction. In one dwelling mound four superimposed and

complete stone hearths were found, having a layer of clay one foot deep

intervening between each. In another dwelling a good door-step was

unearthed. The timber foundations of the dwelling mounds recently

examined have been found to vary little from those previously explored,

with this exception, that one of the small mounds was found to be

covering a beam of oak fourteen feet in length, with a mortise-hole near

each end, one end lying on and at right angles to a large tree trunk, the

two pieces of timber being kept in place by a pile, the upper end of which

was found a short distance below the hearth of the dwelling. Other

mortised beams were discovered in the vicinity, but it has not been

possible as yet to make out their original arrangement, but the one just

mentioned, although in situ, was evidently not intended, in the first place,

Afor part of the substructure of a dwelling.  number of important

objects have been unearthed from the peat outside the village border, as

well as from the floors of the dwellings and the ground between them.

As during the seasons of 1892, 1893, and 1894, large quantities of hand-

and wheel-made pottery, clay sling pellets, and bones of animals have

been dug up. Among the things that may be specially mentioned are the

following :

spiral linger and other rings, one pin, two needles, three fibulae.

  --Iron. Among the objects of iron are a spear-head, bill-hook, horse-

bit, rings, knives, and a flat piece of the metal more than two feet long,

presumably an unfinished sword.

  --Lead. Several rings and spindle whorls, or weights.
  --Bone. The human remains have been more plentiful than in the

previous seasons, and include three complete skulls, fragments of five
others, two first cervical vertebra, one being badly fractured ; fragments
of bone of a burnt body, the complete skeleton of a very young child,
with the exception of the bones of the lower extremities and one arm.

     These, with the exception of one bone, were obtained from various

parts of the peat outside the village.

The bones of animals and birds found since presenting the last report

--have not yet been examined.
     Worked Bone and Horn. The objects of cut bone and horn found this
season number considerably over a hundred, among them being handles
of knives, weaving-combs, needles, haftings, gouges, and a variety of

other implements.
--Wood. Some of the more important finds made of wood have been :
ASix spokes of a wheel, about 13^ inches long.
                                                complete ladder of four

steps, the sides being nearly 7 feet long, made of two split pieces of ash,

each side being perforated with four small square mortise-holes for
holding the steps. The lowermost step was kept in place by a wooden

pin driven through it transversely on the outside. The original top step
of wood was missing, but in its place one of plaited withs had been

substituted.

   A saw-shaped implement of wood, 4 feet long, the greatest width

being 2j inches, the handle 15 inches in length ; along one edge of the

blade portion, which tapers to a point, there are a number of saw-like
notches, averaging half an inch in depth. This implement was found

lying at the side of the ladder in the peat, outside the west border of the

village.

     Portions of several tubs, buckets, and cups have been dug up ; the
tubs were, for the most part, stave-made and dovetailed together with

wooden pegs ; others were cut from the solid. From measurements the
fragments show the complete utensils to have ranged from 6 inches to

2 feet 6 inches in height, and from a few inches to two feet in diameter.

   A door 3 feet 6 inches high and 16 inches wide, made of one piece of

oak, with projections from one edge, above and below, about 4 inches long.
     The greater part of a basket, which, when complete, must have been

18 inches high.
     Part of a second boat ; the fragment is 20 feet long, cut from the

solid wood, and belonged to a boat of much greater length. At some

places on the inner surface tool-marks and charring were plainly seen.

    Many other pieces of wood- work have been found, such as parts of

boxes, pegs, pins, and mortised framework.
     The botanical, osteological, and geological specimens, recently dis-

covered, have not yet been examined : they will be described in a subse-

quent report.

The Committee, as was expected last year, are now able to complete their

work for the present by sending in the final report, by Dr. Franz Boas,
on ' The Indians of British Columbia.'

      In concluding the investigations which have since the Montreal Meet-
ing of 1884 been carried on under their direction, the Committee desire
to return thanks for the liberality with which the British Association
took up the task of preserving records of the Anthropology of the North

Western Tribes of the Dominion of Canada. With equal generosity, the
Canadian Government recognised the necessity of the work by large con-
tribution to the funds at the disposal of the Committee. Thus has been
brought together a collection of valuable physical and philological in-
formation, coupled with accounts of native culture, much of which would
probably have changed or disappeared within a few years had not this

timely enterprise been undertaken.

      For convenience of reference, the principal contributions embodied in
the Committee's series of Reports are here set dovm, viz. :

Fifth Report on the Indians of British Columbia. By Franz Boas.

During the months from September to December 1894, I revisited

British Columbia under instructions of the Committee, the object of the

journey being to fill, so far as possible, gaps left in previous investigations.

I considered four points to be of particular importance : the anthropometry

of those portions of the province which were not covered by previous

work                   an  investigation of                                                      a  Timieh   tribe   on  the extreme northern part
                    ;

of the coast of which I had heard reports, but which has never been de-

scribed ; a study of the customs of the He'iltsuq, and further inquiries in

regard to the Tinneh tribe of Nicola Valley which was first described by

Dr. G. M. Dawson (' Trans. Royal Soc. Canada,' vol. ix. 1891, sec. ii. p. 23).

    On account of lack of time I was unable to visit the He'iltsuq, and

for the same reason I delegated the work in Nicola Valley to Mr. James

Teit, of Spence's Bridge, who is thoroughly conversant with the language

and the customs of the Ntlakya'pamuQ. His report will be found

embodied in the following pages.

The subject matter which I collected on my journey is presented in

the following manner :

                           2. Ts'Ets'a'ut (p. 587).

I have to express my obligation for valuable help extended in the

course of my work to the Rev. Mr. Collison, of Kinkolith ; Mr. George Hunt,

of Fort Rupert ; Mr. C. O. Hastings, of Victoria, British Columbia ; Mr.
James Teit, of Spence's Bridge ; and Rev. Father Le Jeune, of Kamloops.

The following alphabet has been used in this report :--

The vowels have their Continental sounds, namely : a as in father ; e

like a in mate ; i as in machine ; o as in note ; ti as in rule.

d=In addition the following are used : a, 6" as in German ;                                                              aw in law ;

e as in tell ; i as in hill ; 6 as in German voll : E=.e in flower (Lepsius's e).

    Among the consonants the following additional letters have been

used : g-, velar .7; k-, velar k ; q, the German ch in bach ; h, the German

ch in ich ; Q, between q and H ; c=sh in shore ; tl, an explosive I ; dl, a

palatal                I  (dorso-apical)                                                     !,  inci-eased  stress  of articulation ; ', the mouth

I. Physical Characteristics of the Tribes op the North

                                       Pacific Coast.

In the Seventh Report of the Committee I pointed out that the region

around Harrison Lake is inhabited by a peculiar type of man, differing

considerably from the types found in the neighbourhood. It seemed

desirable to investigate the characteristics of the people of the surrounding

country, in order to better define the locality inhabited by this type and

to discover in what manner the transition between the distinct types of

this region takes place. For this purpose I collected anthropometric data

in the region lying between Harrison Lake and Thompson River. This

country is inhabited by the Ntlakya'pamuQ, a tribe speaking a Salish

language which has developed very slight dialectic differences only. The

people of this tribe live in a great many villages which are scattered along

Fraser  and   Thompson    Rivers                             but the villages                  are  grouped in five sub-
                                                          ;

divisions of the tribe, which are named as follows : the Uta'mk-t, who

live between Spuzzum and Keefers ; the Ntlakyapamuq'o'e, or real
Ntlakya'pamuQ, whose territory extends from a little above Keefers to a

point above Thompson Siding on Thompson River, and about twenty

miles up Fraser River from Lytton ; the Nkamtci'nEmuQ, from Thompson
Siding to Ashcroft on Thompson River ; StlaQa'yuQ, on the upper part of
Fraser River, between the Lillooet and the NtlakyapamuQo'e ; and finally,

the Cawa'QamuQ, of Nicola Valley. For the purpose of my investigation

I kept these divisions separate.

Furthermore, the anthropometric material given in the Seventh Report

of the Committee was very insufficient so far as the northern parts of the

coast are concerned. For the purpose of filling this gap I collected data
among the Nass River Indians and among the Kwakiutl. The technique

of the measurements was the same as that described in the Seventh Report

of the Committee. I have added to the material which I collected for the

Committee other data which were collected under my direction for the

Anthropological Department of the World's Columbian Exposition ; but I
have refrained from the use of the head measurements which were gathered

at that time, as these would extend the scope of the Report beyond desirable

limits.

   A glance at the tables (p. 544) will show that a very material change of

type takes place somewhere between Vancouver Island and Skeena River.
For this reason it is necessary to compare the various Kwakiutl tribes
among each other before combining them, in order to see if there is any

appreciable difference between them. According to their location, I have
combined the material which I collected in the following manner : First,

tribes of the Nak'oartok group, embracing the Goasila and Nak'oartok
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

second, tribes of the Koskimo group, embracing the extreme northern

tribes of the Ncotka, the Kwakiutl tribes of the west coast of Vancouver

Island, of   Cape  Scott  and  Newettee                                                third,  the  Kwakiutl  group, em-
                                                                                    ;

bracing the Kwakiutl proper and all the tribes of this group south-east of

Fort Rupert.

The following tables show the results of this comparison :

528 REPORT-- 1895.

      It appears that the three groups are quite uniform. Possibly the breadth
of face of the most northern group, the Nak'oart6k, is a little larger than

that of the others, but the number of cases is so small that it remains
doubtful if there is any real difference bet-ween the types. It will be
seen that the three tribes differ very considerably from the Nass River
Indians, their faces being much higher and narrower.

      In order to prove properly the uniformity of the material collected

among the Kwakiutl, it is necessary to take into consideration their habit
of deforming the head by means of a pressure brought to bear upon the
front and sides of the head. Possibly the practice might have an effect
upon the development of the face, which differs much from the form found
among all the neighbouring tribes. In order to decide if the artificial

--deformation has any influence upon the form of the face, I have divided

the material into three groups : Heads not deformed or slightly deformed
only, moderately deformed heads, and strongly deformed heads. As will
be seen from the tables showing the measurements of individuals, I made

--finer distinctions when recording the original observations, namely : Not

deformed, slightly deformed, moderately deformed, considerably deformed,

strongly deformed, and very strongly deformed. The first two classes
embrace children and young persons only, the practice of deformation
being gradually abandoned. Lea-ving these out of consideration, we find
the following numbers of individuals in each class :

       ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.        529

Kwakiutl, so far as tliey are represented in my measurements, belong to

one type, the tables reveal considerable differences among the subdivisions

of the Ntlakya'pamuQ. Besides the groups named above, I subdivided

the Uta'mk-t into two groups, that of Spuzzum and that of the villages

higher up Fraser River. Unfortunately, in the limited time at my dis-

posal, I was unable to obtain measurements of the StIaQa'yuQ of Fraser
ARiver and of the Cawa'QamuQ of Nicola Valley.
                                                study of the last-

named group would be of interest on account of the admixture of Tinneh

blood in this region.

     In the following pages the measurements and a few tables which
show the principal results obtained by their means are given.

It will be seen (pp. 530 and 531) that the statures of men and women of

the different tribes are nearly arranged in the same order, differences ap-

pearing only in cases where the number of observations is very small. I

have given the averages of the various series, not because I consider the

averages as the typical values of the tribes, but because they give a con-

venient index for purposes of comparison. The table shows a gradual

"decrease in stature as we go southward along the coast from Alaska to

Fraser River. In the series for men the stature decreases from 173 cm.
among the Tlingit to 169 cm. among the Haida and Tsimshian ; while
the Nass River tribes, who live farther inland, and who are probably

mixed with Tinneh tribes of the interior, are only 167 cm. tall, the

Tinneh of the interior being in their turn only 164 cm. tall. As we

proceed southward, the stature decreases to 166 cm. among the Bilqula,

164 among the Kwakiutl, 162 in the Delta of Fraser River, and reaches

its minimum of 158 cm. on the shores of Harrison Lake. As we go

southward, the stature increases again, but its distribution becomes very

irregular. The Salish tribes of Puget Sound and the Yakonan, Tinneh,

and other tribes of Oregon have a stature of 165 cm. It seems that the

Clallam and Nanaimo represent a taller people, but I am not quite certain

of this, as some of the taller half-breeds may have been included in these
series. On Columbia River the Chinook, who extend from Dalles to the

coast, represent a taller type of a stature of 169 cm., which may be con-

sidered as a continuation of the tall Sahaptin type, which has a stature of

170 cm. South of the Oregonian Tinneh the stature increases slightly,

reaching 168 cm. among the Klamath, and sinking again to 166 among

the Hoopa. The tribes of California, who lived north of San Francisco,
and who are gathered on the Round Valley Reservation, near Cape

Mendocino, represent a very short type of 162 cm. only, which is also

distinguished by its elongated head. When we consider the stature of

the inland tribes, we may say that the stature decreases north and south

from Columbia River. The Sahaptin, a people of a stature of 170 cm.,

represent the tallest type ; northward we find the Spokane and Okanagau

168 cm. tall, the Shuswap of South Thompson River of the same stature,

while those of North Thompson River measure 167 cm. only. The Chil-

ootin measure only 164 cm. Along Columbia River the tall stature

extends to the sea. In the part of Oregon east of the Cascade Range, and

in western Nevada, we find statures of 168 cm., while the Shoshone

tribes of Idaho and Utah measure 166 cm. only.

I have added to these tribes the Eskimo of Alaska and those of

Labrador. It will be seen that, while the latter are exceedingly short

the stature of those of Alaska equals that of the Bilqula, reaching 166 cm.
The measurements of the Alaskan Eskimo prove clearly that they are
mixed to a considerable extent with Tinneh blood.

     I think the points of particular interest brought out by this statement
are the gradual change of stature in British Columbia and the great
irregularity of distribution in the southern regions. There are no differ-
ences of food supply or mode of life of the people which would have the
effect that the stature should be lowest on Lower Fraser River, and in-
crease in both directions along the coast, or that the same decrease should
be found as we descend Fraser River. It seems that these phenomena
can be explained only by a slow permeation of the tall tribes of the north
and of the short tribes of Fraser River. It is curious to note that the
distribution of stature shows regular changes, while all other features are
distributed in quite a different manner, as will appear later on.

     It is of some interest to compare the stature of men and women. "When
we consider the tribes contained in the preceding list, we find the following

result :

--)44 REPORT 1895.

    I conclude from the preceding tables that we must distinguish four

types on the coast of British Columbia : the northern type, represented

in  our  tables  by the  Nass  River  Indians                                       the Kwakiutl  type                   that  of
                                                                                 ;                                    ;

Harrison Lake and the Salish of the interior, as represented by the Oka-

iiagan, Flathead, and Shuswap. The Ntlakya'pamuQ appear essentially as

a mixed people.

    In order to bring out the differences between these types clearly I will

give the average values of the various measurements and indices side by
aide. I repeat, however, that these averages must not be considered as

the types of the various series, which are evidently exceedingly complex,

but only as indices of the general distribution.

         ·
               ON THE NOKTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.      oi-O

over the face is also very slight only. The bridge is generally concave,

and very flat between the eyes. The Kvvakiutl are somewhat shorter,

their bodies are relatively longer, their arms and legs shorter than those

of the first group. The dimensions of the head are very nearly the same,

but the face shows a remarkably different type, which distinguishes it

fundamentally from the faces of all the other groups. The breadth of the

face exceeds only slightly the average breadth of face of the Indian, but

its height is enormous. The same may be said of the nose, which is very

high and relatively narrow. Its elevation is also very great. The nasal

bones are strongly developed, and form a steep arch, tlieir lower end

rising high above the face. This causes a very strongly hooked nose to

be found frequently among the Kwakiutl, while that type of nose is almost

absent in all other parts of the Pacific coast. This feature is so strongly

marked that individuals of this group may be recognised with a con-

siderable degree of certainty by the form of the face and of the nose

alone. It will be noticed that in this group the facial and the nasal

indices of the women indicate that their faces ai-e more leptoprosopic,

their noses more leptorrhinic, than those of the men, while among almost

all races the reverse is the case. This fact led me first to suspect that

the artificial deformation which is more strongly developed among women

might be the cause of the peculiar form of the face of this tribe. I have

shown, however, in the preceding pages that the observations give no

countenance to this theory. Besides this the Bilqula show the same

features and the same relation between the two sexes, although the heads

of the men are not deformed, and those of the women are deformed in a

different manner. The measurements of Bilqula women can, however,

claim no great weight, as they are too few in number.

The Harrison Lake type has a very short stature. Tlie head is ex-

ceedingly short and broad, surpassing in this respect all other forms known

to exist in North America. The face is not very wide, but very low, thus

producing a chamseprosopic form the proportions of which resemble those

of the Nass River face, while its dimensions are much smaller. In this

small face we find a nose which is absolutely higher than that of the Nass

River Indian with his huge face. It is, at the same time, rather narrow.

The lower portion of the face appears very small, as may be seen by

subtracting the height of the nose from that of the face, which gives an

approximate measure of the distance from septum to chin. The values

of this measurement for the four types are 69, 73, 62, and 67 mm.

respectively.

The Shuswap represent a type which is found all over the interior of

British Columbia, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, so far as they are in-

habited by Salishan and Sahaptin tribes. Their stature is approximately

168 cm. The head is shorter than that of the tribes of Northern British

Columbia or of the Indians of the plains. The face has the average height

of the Indian face, being higher than that of the Nass River Indians, but

lower than that of the Kwakiutl. The nose is high and wide, and has the

characteristic Indian form, which is rare in most parts of the coast. The

facial and nasal indices are intermediate between those of the Kwakiutl

and of the Nass River tribes.

I marked together with the measurements of the Indians certain

descriptive features. I give here a tabulation of these observations,

but only those taken during the journey of 1894, as I find that it is very

difiicult to compare descriptive features on account of the large personal

1895.                                                  NN

equation of the observers, and even of the same observer at different times.
The type which is being described exerts a deep influence upon the form
of description. Thus when first visiting the Indians there is a tendency
to describe the lips as thick because they are compared with those of the
whites, while later on they are called moderate because Indian lips are
compared among themselves. Descriptive features are, therefore, of no
great value, owing to the inaccuracy of the terms involved. Still, some

striking differences will be noticed in the following tabulations of the de-

scriptive features of men from 20 to 59 years of age :
ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.  547

it is likely that more extended investigations would cause the apparent

difference to disappear ; but it is also possible that in this region we may

tind the length of head to increase more rapidly than the bi'eadth of head.

Among the Eastern Indians, and in different parts of Europe, we find a

slight decrease of the cephalic index with increasing age, but in no

case does the difference exceed 1 per cent. "We find also that the heads

of women are somewhat shorter than those of men. The following tabu-
lation shows that among the northern tribes the same relations prevail,
but that among the Ntlakya'pamuQ the heads of adults appear much more

elongated than those of children.

cephalic index decreases rapidly as we go up Fraser River, but it is higher
among the Shuswap than among the Nkamtd'nEmuQ. The facial index

increases quite i-egularly from Harrison Lake to the Shuswap, but we
must remember that the face of the NtlakyapamuQ'o'e is much smaller
than that of the Shuswap and that of the lower divisions of the Ntlakya'-
pamuQ. The nasal index is so variable that we cannot draw any con-

clusions from its average values.

     It seems, therefore, that there is a disturbing element among the
NtlakyapamuQ'o'e whicli conceals among them the gradual approach of
forms between the Harrison Lake type and that of the Shuswap. This

fact does not seem surprising, as it is likely that mixture has taken place
along Fraser River. The low values of the breadth of face remind us
of the Tinneh tribes of Oregon and California, and I do not consider

it unlikely that we may find here the effects of an admixture of Tinneh

blood.

    However the peculiarities of the NtlakyapamuQ o'e may be explained,
the fact remains that the Ntlakya'pamuQ, who represent a people speaking

one language, are physically by no means homogeneous. The upper and

lower divisions indicate clearly the effect of mixture with the neighbour-

ing tribes; while the central group, 'the real Ntlakya'pamuQ,' present

peculiarities of their own, which may be the old characteristics of the
Ntlakya'pamuQ, or which may be due to admixture of Tinneh blood. The

gradual change of type along Fraser River proves clearly that these tribes
must have occupied these regions for very long times, and that the

population has been very stable. The differences in type between the

divisions of this people oiler an excellent example of the fact that linguis-

tic and anatomical classifications do not follow the same lines ; that people

who are the same in type, and must therefore be related in blood, may

speak different languages                                                                                   and  that people who difier in  type  may speak
                                                                                                         ;

the same language.

    It remains to give a review of the number of children of women of

the tribes which I investigated. The data obtained by means of this

inquiry allow us to understand the causes of the diminution in numbers
among these Indians, and suggest at the same time a possible remedy for

this sad fact. I give here the number of living and deceased children

of all the women whom I measured, arranged according to ages.
    When we direct our attention to the average number of children of

women of more than forty years of age, we find the following result :

        Nass River Indians                                                                                       4'8 children ( 6 cases)

     Although the number of observations is small, the general result is
undoubtedly correct, and agrees with the relative number of children in
the villages of the various groups, the number being very small among the
Kwakiutl, and much larger among the other tribes. The number of chil-
dren among the Ntlakya'pamuQ equals that found among the tribes of
other parts of North America, while that of the Kwakiutl is much smaller.

     The cause of the diminution of the tribes becomes clearest when we
consider that group of mothers who may just begin to have adult chil-

dren, that is, between the ages of thirty-idve and forty-five years. At

these ages they will have children who are not yet mature, but a portion

of these children will be adults. If the population were to remain stable,
the number of children would have to be considerably more than twice
that of the mothers. The actual distribution is shown by the following

    This table shows how exceedingly unfavourable the conditions are
among the Kwakiutl, as fourteen mothers have produced considerably less
than eight mature children. The figures prove also that a very slight
improvement of the sanitary conditions among the Ntlakya'pamuQ would

produce an increase of the population.

    The cause of the extremely unfavourable conditions among the Kwa-
kiutl becomes particularly clear when the mothers are grouped in decades.

--When this is done we find the following result:

Age of mother . . . 20-30 30-40 40-50 60-60 60 and more.

Average number of children . 2-7 2'1 16 5-2                       49

That is to say, the maximum sterility is found among women who are
now from forty to fifty years old, that is, who became mature about
twenty-five or thirty years ago. This agrees closely with the time when
the Kwakiutl sent theii- women most extensively to Victoria for purposes
of prostitution. During the last decade a number of influential men
among the tribe have set their influence against this practice, and we see

at the same time a rapid increase in the number of children. The young
women who have now an average number of 2-7 children may hope to
regain the number of children which their grandmothers had. But the

only hope of preserving the life of the tribe lies in the most rigid suppres-

sion of these visits of women to Victoria, which are still continued to a

considerable extent, and in an effort to stamp out the diseases which have

been caused by these visits.

                   II. The Tinneh Tribe of Nicola Valley.

     In his Notes on the Shuswap People of British Columbia ' Dr. G. M.
Dawson first called attention to a Tinneh tribe which used to inhabit the
Nicola Valley, but which has become extinct. Some notes on the history
of this tribe were given by Dr. Dawson according to information obtained

from Mr. J. W. McKay, formerly Indian Agent at Kamloops, who has an
extensive knowledge of the Indians of the interior. As parts of this

information conflicted with reports which I had received, and as it seemed
desirable to gather as much information as possil)le on this tribe, I

resolved to visit them in the course of my investigations. Owing to

pressure of time I had to give up the intended journey, and requested Mr.

James Teit, who is thoroughly familiar with the Ntlakya'pamuQ, to try to
collect as much information as possible on the tribe. He visited Nicola
Valley early in March 1895, and reports the results of his work as

follows :

                       ^ Trans. Royal Soc. Canada, vol. ix. 1891, sect. ii. p. 23.
552 REFORT-- 1895.

' I saw the three old men who are said to know the old StuwrnamuQ

language, which was formerly spoken in Nicola Valley, and found that they

only remembered a few woi'ds of what they had heard from their fathers.

One of them could only give me five or six words, another one twelve,

and another one twenty. As many of these words were the same, I only

obtained twenty distinct words and three phrases. I also learned two

Aplace-names used by them which I think are probably Tinneh.  few of

the words which I obtained are not on the lists of Dr. Dawson and

Mr. McKay. One Indian, who also knows some words of the language, is

living at present in Similkameen ; therefore I was unable to see him. It

is unfortunate that the work of collectinfj the remains of the language

was not undertaken a few years sooner. An old woman who was half

Stuwi'namuQ died in Nicola only five years ago. She was the last person

who could talk the language properly. The three Indians whom I saw

are only one quarter Stuwi'namuQ blood ; each of them is old and white-
haired, and I should judge over seventy years of age. One of them said

he remembered that when he was a boy his grandfather (who was then a
very old man and hardly able to walk) pointed out to him the spot on the

Nicola a little below the lake where he (the old man) was born, and also

told him that his people had always inhabited that region. This old man

must have been born in Nicola at least 120 years ago, and it seems that

he had no knowledge of the origin of his tribe.

    ' Another old man whom I saw was taken when a lad, by his father,

all over the boundaries of the tribal territory in order to impress upon

him the different landmarks which constituted at that time the tribal

boundaries. One of the old men named his ancestors for four generations

back, saying that at that time the whole tribe lived in three camps or

subterranean lodges, and that there were not very many people in each

(probably from forty to fifty souls), and that they all wintered along

Nicola River below the lake, and in close proximity to each other. They

also had two fortified houses in which they took refuge when threatened

by war parties of other tribes. The man mentioned war parties of

Okanagan, Ntlakya'pamuQ, and Shuswap, who attacked their fortifications

unsuccessfully. These events happened three or four generations before

his time.

' Three generations ago the tribe had some admixture of Okanagan and

Ntlakya'pamuQ blood. Some of them had wives from among their tribes,

and the latter took wives from among them. They claim that their tribe

never went on war expeditions into the territories of other tribes, and

they say, with pride, that their country is the only one in this region where

the white men's blood has never been shed. They have a tradition that

at one time their tribe was numerous and that their southern boundary

extended to Keremeous, on the Lower Similkameen River. They have no

tradition regarding a foreign origin, and were quite indignant when I

mentioned to them Mr. McKay's theory of tlieir being descended from a

war party of Chilcotin. They said that when young they had heard the

old people of the tribe telling mythological stories, but these were just the

same as those current among the Okanagan and Ntlakya'pamuQ. At my

request they told me some of these stories which had been told to them by

their grandfathers, and I recognised them as identical with those which

I had heard at Spence's Bridge, and which are current in slightly dif-

ferent versions among the interior Salish. I questioned them extensively

regarding the customs of their ancestors, and found that these corresponded
ON THE NORTH-WESTERX TRIBES OK CANADA,  OOO

exactly with those of the Ntlakya'pamuQ. Their weapons were also exactly
the same. Their personal names, so far back as they can trace them, are also

Ntlakya'pamuQ. The oldest personal name that they could give me was
that of a man of note among them called TsuQkokwa s. This is the only
name that I do not recognise as Ntlakya'pamuQ. They said that the pure
Stiiwi'iiamuQ whom they had seen were of about the same height as the

Ntlakya'pamuQ and Okanagan, but generally heavier in build. They
were also of the same complexion. Their features were slightly different,
but they could not explain wherein the difference consisted. They told

me the names by which the tribe was known among themselves, and also by

neighbouring tribes. These names have all the Salish suffix -muQ,
meaning people. These names are SEi'lEqamuQ (said to mean people of
the liigli country) ; Smile'kamuQandStuwrHamuQ. The last is the name
by which they are principally known to the Ntlakya'pamuQ, who have
from time immemorial called the upper Nicola country Stuwi'n. The

Indians at Spence's Bridge say that this is probably one of the many

forms of their word meaning " creek," such as Cawa'uQ, Tcawa'q, Tcuwa'uQ,
StcwauQ. Sfii'lEqamuQ is decidedly a Ntlakya'pamuQ word. Smile'kamuQ

is probably connected with the place-name Smilekami'n or Smilekami'nuQ,
of which Similkameen is a corruption. They say that about sixty years
ago the winter habitations of the Ntlakya'pamuQ extended up the Nicola
River only some seventeen miles. The country above this point was
recognised as belonging to the StuwI'iiamuQ. The Ntlakya'pamuQ called

their division which lived along the Lower Nicola River, Tcawa'QamuQ,
but the StuwI'HamuQ called them Nkamtcl'nEmuQ, and looked upon them
as a part of the division extending irom Thompson Siding to Ashcroft.

The Tcawa'QamuQ, or Cawa'QamuQ, used in former days only to go into the
Stiiwi'ii country in the summer and fall of the year to hunt. (The
reason that the Cawa'QamuQ at that time inhabited principally the lower

part of Nicola River was no doubt on account of the superior fishing

facilities.) When the number of horses of the Cawa'QamuQ and

NkamtcI'nEmuQ began to increase, many of these people moved up to the

Stuwi'H country on account of its good grazing, and settled there about

 fifteen years before the advent of the white miners in 1858. After the

country was partly settled by the whites more Cawa'QamuQ and
 NkamtcI'nEmuQ, many Uta'mk't, and some NtlakyapamuQ'oe and
 Okanagan settled in the Stuwi'H country, being attracted by its farming
 facilities. Shortly before the arrival of the whites the Okanagan com-
 menced to make permanent settlements in the neighbourhood of Douglas
 Lake on account of the good grazing in that region. The Nicola Tinneh,
 who were already mixed with these tribes, never offered any opposition to
 their settlement. At the time of the advent of the whites (1858) the
 recognised chief of the Nicola country was NEwisiskin, a Cawa'QamuQ,
 born within seven miles of Spence's Bridge. The Ntlakya'pamuQ soon

 became the pj-evailing language of that district. It seems that at least
 for several generations back the Stuwi'HamuQ simply acted on the
 defensive. The Ntlakya'pamuQ and Okanagan made what use they liked
 of the Stuwi'ir country, hunting in it and passing through it when

 they desired. The Okanagan always went by that route when going to

 trade with the NkamtcI'nEmuQ. Parties of Shuswap, Okanagan, and
 Ntlakya'pamuQ on war expeditions against each other passed through the

 Stuwi'H country unmolested.

     ' One of the old men whom I saw, named Tcuie'ska or Se'suluskin, is
--554 REPORT 1895.

the first person of the Ntlakya'pamuQ whom I have seen tattooed on the
body. He is one quarter Stuwi'namuQ, one quarter Okanagan, and half
Nkamtci'nEmuQ. He said that formerly the Stuwi'HamuQ were occa-

sionally tattooed on the body, as were also some of the Nkamtci'nEmuQ.'

     So far Mr. Teit's report. It may be mentioned in connection with

these facts that the Ntlakya'pamuQ, near the mouth of Nicola Valley, are
the only people who use round lodges in summer, not squai-e lodges, such as

I described in my report on the Shuswap. This custom may be due to

contact with the Tinneh tribe, or to that of the Okanagan, who are said

to use round lodges.

     From what we know about Indian life, Mr. McKay's theory that the
Stuwi'namuQ are descendants of a Chilcotin war party, which was hemmed

in by the Ntlakya'pamuQ, seems very unlikely, and Mr. Teit's data prove
beyond a doubt that the people have lived in the Similkameen and Nicola
regions for a long time. I do not doubt that they must be considered

the most northern of the isolated bands of Tinneh origin which are found

all along the Pacific coast.

     These words show that the dialect was much more closely related to

the Tinneh languages of British Columbia than to those farther south,
although it would seem to have differed from the former also considerably.

A comparison of vocabularies, which shows the relationships of these

dialects, will be found in the linguistic part of this report.

  III. The Tinneh Tribe op the Portland Inlet, the Ts'ets'a'ut.

    On my second journey to British Columbia I made an effort to find

members of a tribe that was reported as living on Portland Inlet, and as

being slaves of ' Chief Mountain,' the chief of a Nisk-a' clan. I received

reports of this tribe from Mr. Duncan, and some additional data were

learned from the Tsimshian. On my last trip I visited the village

Kinkolith, at the mouth of Nass River, whither the tribe was said to resort
at certain seasons of the year. There I found a boy named Jonathan

and one young man named Timothy ; later on, after a prolonged seai-ch,
I found an elderly man, Levi. From these three men the follow-
ing information was obtained. Levi was the only one who spoke the
language well, while the two young men used almost exclusively the

Nisk'a' in their conversations. All the ethnological and historical data
were given by Levi. The language proved, as I anticipated, to be a Tinneh
dialect. The tribe is called by the Nisk-a' and by the Tsimshian,

--Ts'Ets'a'ut those of the interior. By this name are designated all the

Tinneh tribes of the interior. It does not refer to any one tribe exclu-
sively, and corresponds to the Tlingit name Gunana'. The number of
members of the tribe is reduced at present to about twelve, and only two

of these continue to speak their own language correctly. The native
name of the tribe is forgotten, and we must therefore continue to desig-
nate them as Ts'Ets'a'ut. According to tlie testimony of the Nisk-a' and
of the Ts'Ets'a'ut, the latter form a tribe different from the Laq'uyi'p (= on
the prairie), who have their principal villages on the head waters of the
Stikeen River. They are called Naqkyina (on the other side) by the
Ts'Ets'a'ut. Their town is called Gunaqa'. Levi named three closely

related tribes whose languages are different though mutually intelligible :
the Tahltan (Ta'tltan), of Stikeen and Iskoot Rivers ; the Laq'uyi'p, or
Naqkyina, of the head waters of the Stikeen ; and the Ts'Ets'a'ut. The
home of the last-named tribe extended from a little north of Tcu'naq

(Chunah) River, in the extreme north-eastern corner of Behm Channel,

eastward to Observatory Inlet, northward to the watershed of Iskoot
River. About sixty years ago this tribe numbered about five hundred
souls, but they were exterminated by continued attacks of the Sa'nak-oan,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        .

the Tlingit tribe of Boca de Quadra and of the Laq'uyi'p. The present

generation contine their wanderings to the surroundings of Portland

Inlet, north of Port Ramsden. At my request Levi drew a map of this

region, which is here reproduced. It will be seen that all the rivers of

the inlet have Tinneh names. Levi gave me also the Tinneh names of
the rivers emptying into Behm Channel and of several places in Observa-

tory Inlet.

    Among these names two are worth a remark : Atlamatset'at'a', on the

west side of Portland Inlet, is so called on account of a localised tradition.

It is said that in the beginning there were no mountain-goats. One day
a man named Atlama went up the mountains and found a cave full of

goats. He hid at the entrance of the cave and killed the goats when they
came out, one after the other. He caught two kids, tied their legs, and

carried them down to the camp. Therefore the place was called Atla-

matset'at'a'. The second place which is worth remarking is Cadouga',
because it has the same name in Nisk'a', which shows that the Tinneh
name was adopted by the intruding Nisk'a'.

When the members of the tribe were reduced in numbers the Nisk'a'

began to claim Portland Inlet as their territory, and ' Chief Mountain '

monopolised the right of trading .with the Ts'Ets'a'ut. Since that time

they have been called his slaves.

These reports on the former locatioii of the tribe are corroborated by the

fact that all their legends are localised either on Tcu'naq River, which seems

to have been their principal haunt, or on Portland Inlet, and on rivers

and lakes of the peninsula between Portland Inlet and Behm Channel.

I learned the following particulars in regard to their history.

    According to the statements of Levi, they lived in olden times much
more frequently on Behm Channel than on Portland Inlet. At that

lime they were on friendly terms with the Sa'nak'oan (Ssanghakon,

Krause) of Boca de Quadra. The chief of the latter was their friend, and
some of their number were in the habit of staying with the Sa'nak-oan.

After his death the Sa'nak-oan intended to kill the Ts'Ets'a'ut, and to en-

slave the women and children. The chief's nephews, however, informed

them of this plan, and from that time they hunted more frequently around

Portland Inlet. They then fell in, for the first time, with the Nisk-a' on

Portland Inlet. The names of men whom they met there were K"aya'q,

Guna'q, and Gyitqo'n.

Three friends of the deceased chief of the Sa'nak-oan, whose names

were Walk-En, Tlaqo'ns, and Qutk-a', resolved to pursue the Ts'Ets'a'ut,

whose chief at that time was K"'acgueta', a member of the Laqskl'yek

clan. Tlaqo'ns and Qutk-a' wei-e brothers, and the last-named had

married a K'utlk-oa'n svoman. This tribe lived, at that time, on Revilla

Gigedo Island, while nowadays they have joined the Sta'kink-oan. They
are called by the Niska' Gyitqa'el. These three men followed the
Ts'Ets'a'ut. They found that they had made friends with the Nisk-a', and
that most of them were hunting south of Nass River, near the village op-

posite Greenville, while some had gone to Observatory Inlet. They did not
dare to follow them into the country of the Nisk-a', and turned back.
They returned to Boca de Quadra, and went to a place which was owned
by K-asa'qs, the chief of an eagle clan of the Sa'nak-oan. They call this

place K-a'itl, while the Ts'Ets'a'ut call the river which empties there

Atqatqaga.' This is the most southern of three rivers emptying in
Quadra Bay. The middle one is called Nugufega', the most northern one

Tsetliega' in the Ts'Ets'a'ut language. In the following autumn the

Ts'Ets'a'ut returned to the mouth of Atqatqaga', and fell in with the

Sa'nak-oan. The latter invited them to come down to the place wliere

their fish was stored, which they proposed to exchange for skins. There

were three Laq.ski'yek men, three Laqkyebo' women, and fourteen

children in the party. They had three guns among them. Levi's uncle

was one of the party. It was raining, and as soon as they reached the

camp the Ts'Ets'a'ut placed their guns over the fire in order to dry them.

The Sa'nak-oan had loaded their guns outside. They had two lonw funs
Aand one short one.
                       Tongass woman, who was married to one of the

Sa'nak-oan, was friendly to the Ts'Ets'a'ut, as were all the members of her

tribe, and she cried all the time in order to warn them, but they did not

understand what she meant. In order to provoke a quarrel Tlaqo'ns, who

owned the short gun, asked one of the Ts'Ets'a'ut if he thought thiit the

gun would kill a bear. The Ts'Ets'a'ut thought it was too small. Then

Tlaqo'ns took the guns of the Ts'Ets'a'ut, which were small-bore, from the

drying frame, and, under pretence of examining them, placed them out

cut off' the barrel in order to make it handier. He pretended to take

off"ence at the deprecatory remarks of the Ts'Ets'a'ut and shot him. At

this signal his companions shot the other men. They took the bodies and

the women and children in their canoe, and threw the former into the sea.

When the Ts'Ets'a'ut heard of what had happened, they went to Nass River

in order to attack the Sa'nak-oan when they should come to buy olachen

grease. But they did not dare to come for several years. From that

time the Ts'Ets'a'ut made Portland Inlet their headquarters. These

events happened before Levi was born, i.e., about sixty years ago. But

the attacks of the Sa'nak-oan continued afterwards. Whenever one of

their chiefs died, they tried to kill some of the Ts'Ets'a'ut, and to obtain

slaves from among their number.

At one time an uncle of Levi had run away with a girl whose

parents refused to give her to him in marriage. At Halibut Bay

he met a Nisk'a', whom he requested to take him across the inlet.

The Nisk-a', who wanted to buy marmot skins, proposed to go back to

Nass River to fetch powder and lead, and was going to return in order

to take the couple across the inlet. In return the Ts'Ets'a'ut was

to catch for him a certain number of marmots. While he was away a

canoe carrying three Nisk-a' men (Gyitqo'n, a Laqski'yek ; Nesqba'k-t, a

GyispawaduwE'da                                                                         and  Sinatlo'dt,  a K-anha'da) landed.  The Ts'Ets'a'ut
                                                                                     ;

owed some marmot skins to the first of these men, who demanded imme-

diate payment. The Ts'Ets'a'ut explained that he had no skins, because

he had run away with a girl, but Gyitqo'n did not listen. He got angry,

and killed the Ts'Ets'a'ut with his axe. The woman ran away, but

Nesqba'k-t shot and killed her. Then they buried them at the foot of a

tree. After a while the first Nisk-a' returned, but did not find the couple.

When he saw their dog running about, he thought that the three men
whom he had met might have killed them. He went to Tombstone Bay,

where many Ts'Ets'a'ut were encamped, in order to catch salmon. He took

the dog along, and told them what had happened. Then all those who

were encamped at the Bay, about fifty in number, struck camp because

they became afraid of the Nisk-a'. They were more willing to brave the

attacks of the Sa'nak-oan than those of the more numerous Nisk-a'.

One of the Sa'nak-oan had a Ts'Ets'a'ut woman for his wife. They fell in

with him, and he took them to the large island K'a'tik' (Tlingit name; pro-

bably Revilla Gigedo Island). After some time the K'u'tlk-oan learned of

their whereabouts and searched for them. When they had found them

they wanted to remove them to the mainland. The Ts'Ets'a'ut agreed to

go, but during the night, while all were asleep, the K'u'tlk-oan produced

their guns which they had hidden, and shot all the men and women. One

of the Ts'Ets'a'ut, who had a gun, was killed while he was aiming at one

of their aggressors. They put the children into their canoe as slaves, but

as there were too many of them they threw eight of their number into

the sea. Thirty were enslaved.

Another quarrel took place about forty-five years ago. One winter,

about the month of February, Levi's father and several other men went

from Portland Inlet to Qa'itl, which is a river near Tcii'naq. They

pitched their camp near the mouth of the river. After some time one

man and his wife saw a canoe coming. When the canoe landed they saw

that several Sa'nak-oan were in it. The latter gave them tobacco, powder,

and balls, and inquired for their camp. After they had learned where it
--

was, they promised to call there on the following day. The Sa'nak'oan

camped in the entrance of a small bay. On the following morning they

went to the camp of the Ts'Ets'a'ut, and after having eaten they began to
trade, the Sa'nak'oan buying skins for tobacco, powder, lead, and shirts.

On the following morning two Sa'nak-oan brothers, K-atse'el and Yaqte'it,
remai-ked that there were many crows on the beach, and took up their

guns in order to shoot them. After a short while they re-entered the hut,

one of them holding his gun under his blanket. He aimed at one of the

Ts'Ets'a'ut, hiding his gun under his blanket all the time, and shot him.

At this signal his brother shot another man, and a third of the Sa'nak'oan,
whose names wei-e K'ahote' and Nag'atse' (Fox), shot a third man. The

others drew their daggers, and killed all the Ts'Ets'a'ut men. They en-

slaved the women and children, and took them to Revilla Gigedo Island,

where they stayed the rest of the winter. In the spring of the year

Levi's mother made good her escape, taking her two children along. She

made a bark canoe, crossed Behm Channel, and after two months of hard-

ships they reached Tombstone Bay, on Portland Inlet, where they met the
Ts'Ets'a'ut who had stayed on the inlet. ' Eve,' who is old now, was sold

at that time to the Sketk'oa'n, from whom she escaped.
    At another time, while Levi was a boy, the Ts'Ets'a'ut had a war with

the Laq'uyi'p. At that time his sister had just married a man named

NEgusts'ikatsa'. They were hunting north of the upper reaches of Nass

River. When they returned to Portland Inlet a party of Laq'uyi'p came

there accompanying a Ts'Ets'a'ut hunter. The Ts'Ets'a'ut had one gun
among them, and were about to shoot at the Laq'uyi'p when their country

man asked them to desist, as the Lag'uyi'p had come to make peace and
to pay for those who had been killed in previous wars. The Ts'Ets'a'ut

allowed them to approach and gave them to eat. When they were about

to go to bed they showed the Laq'uyi'p their gun. One of the latter kept
it, and in the ensuing quarrel he shot two of the Ts'Ets'a'ut. Levi added

here that in olden times his countrymen were ' as stupid as ghosts.'

      These historical data define their territory fairly well.'

    ' Mr. J. AV. McKay on hearing indirectly of my researches at Portland Inlet

published in a journal which commands some authority in Canada {The. Province,

Victoria, B.C., December 29, 1894) a correction before any of my observations were
made public. He says that these Indians ' belong to the Kunana, a tribe which in-

habits the lower Stikine Valley, and whose headquarters are at Tahltan, on the tirst
north forlc of the Stilcine River. About fortj' years ago three or four families of these
Indians were hunting in the neighbourhood of the head waters of the Skoot (Iskoot),

a large tributary of the Stikine. Game was scarce, the prospect of a hard winter
stared them in tlie face: they accordicgly decided to make for Chunah, on the sea-
coast, at the head of Behm Inlet. They took a wrong direction and struck the coast

on the west shore of Portland Channel. They were then discovered by one of the
headmen of the Naas tribe, who arranged with them to protect them from molestation
provided that they sold all the product of their fur hunts to him at liis price. Having
no alternative but to accept his proposition, or be sold into slavery, they agreed to
be his vassals, and have remained as such to his heirs and assigns to this day. They
are not the remnants of a tribe ; they belong to a tribe which still maintains its
normal strength in the vallev of the Stikine.'

     In a letter addressed to Dr. G. M. Dawson and dated Victoria, B.C., Januaiy 19,
189.0, Mr. McKay makes the following additional statement :

     ' I have your letter of the tith instant touching Dr. Boas's discovery of a remnant
of a tribe of Indians on Portland Canal. The facts of the case are substantially as

stated in The Province, and were made known to me incidentally during my sojourn

in Cassiar.

560 REPORT-- 1895.

     In regard to the personal appeai-ance of the Ts'Ets'a'ut I refer to the

measurements contained in the tirst part of this report. Tlic individuals

whom I saw were short, of light colour, with broad and flat faces and low

noses. Their mouths were full. Their general appearancr; is very much

like that of the Nisk"a'.

     They have no fixed villages, but make a camp wherever tlioy intend to

hunt. Their staple food is porcupine, marmot, mountain-goat, and bear.

The skins of these animals supply the raatei'ial for clothing. In summer
they go down the rivers of Portland Inlet to catch salmon, which they

dry for winter use

    At present they wear white man's clothing, but according to Levi's

descriptions their old style clothing corresponded to that of otlier Tinneh
tribes. Eoth sexes wore high boots (kiie) made of marmot skins and

reaching to the thighs, and pants (ekiaye ) made of curried skins. Men

wore a leather jacket (aya'n) cut like a shirt and reaching to the middle
of the thigh. In winter they wore a jacket of marmot skins with mittens

attached (agotsqa') and threw a robe of birdskins (tss'a) over their
shoulders. In travelling they tied the robe around their waists by means

of a belt (se). Women wore a short coat, which was tied around the

waist (atlae'), and a jacket (tl'a), both being made of mountain-goatskins.

The skin of the belly of the beaver was also used for the manufacture of

clothing. In recent times both sexes have adopted the use of the moccasin

info my camp and complainerl that Na-nok. the chief of the Tahltan Ku-nii-iia.?,

W(ull not let them proceed to Dease Lake unless thej- paid him something for pass-

ing through his country. I had with me at the time as servant one Jim, a Ku-n;i-r a
Indian, who explained the cause of Na-nok's conduct by detailing the statement
published in The Province. I made Na-nok understand that he must not make
reprisals; that his tribesmen at Portland Inlet had full liberty to return to their own

country if they wished ; that his jurisdiction did not extend to levying tolls on
strangers passing through the country, in which he himself was only a sojourner, as
he had done nothing to improve it ; and that he must let the Naas Indians pass,
which he accordingly did. This happened about twenty years ago.

     'As to the original inhabitants of Portland Inlet the most ancient of which we
have any account is the Tongas band of the Tlinkeet tribe. The wintering villages
of this band at one time extended as far sorth as Muh-Ut-hah-la ; they were driven
northward by two (Metlakathla) hordes of Tsimsians (men of the river) who de-
scended from the interior by the valleys of the Skeena and Naas, took possession of
the Tsimpshian Peninsula, and .'ettled thereon. The Tongas, being forced to relinquish
their rights therein, retired to the coast and islands immediately north of the entrance
to Portland Canal. If there were any inhabitants in Portland Inlet when the Tlinkeets

first reached that locality, they would have been exterminated or otherwise absorbed
bv the latter race before the Tsimshian race made its appearance on the scene of action.

The Tongas would be the most likely Indians to give what information may be
obtainable respecting any race more ancient than themselves, which may have existed
in the locality under consideration. The Tlinkeets of Cape Fox might also be able

to throw some light on the subject.
      'You are aware that the Ku-na-nas of the Stikine Valley are closely allied to the

Tlinkeets of that section, i.e. the Skat-kwan. The Skat-kwan are closely allied to
the Tongas, and these facts may account for the Naas Indians' moderate treatment
of the little band of Ku-na-nas who unfortunately tumbled, as it were, into the lands
of the stranger, and stranger meant enemy in the days and in the country of which

I am writing. Had they reached ClumaJi, a*, the head of the Pehm Canal, the

point for which they were making, they would have been amongst their friends the
Skat-kwan Tlinkeets'

      Theie is no traditional evidence of the invasion of the Tsimshian tribe to which

Mr. McKay refers, although it is probable that the Tsimshian were originally an
inland people. The statements collected by me show also that Mr. McKay is mis-

taken in regard to his notions of the distribution of tribes in Southern Alaska.

(kecikatsse) in place of the high boot. It is made of mountain-goat hide.
The hair was tied in a knot behind the head, while the Tatltan (Tahl-tan)

shaved their heads.

     They wore ear-ornanaents made of the wool of the mountain goat.
These were attached to holes made in the lobe and in the helix. The
nose was also perforated, and ornaments made of haliotis shells or of
coins were suspended from the septum. The clothing was embroidered
with porcupine quills. Before the introduction of glass beads they made

beads of bone. Girls wore hats (see p. 566).

     The houses of the Ts'Ets'a'ut are made of bark, and are of a very temporary

character. They clear a space at the foot of a large tree and place a forked

pole, about seven feet long (atlanaa', fig. 1, (i) ) on each side of the tree, from
about six to eight feet apart. These poles support two slanting poles (eiii',

fig. 1 (2) ) about fourteen feet in length, which are connected by four cross

poles (tetlatsaa', fig. 1 (3) ). The slanting roof and both sides are covered with
bark, while the end next to the tree remains open. Sometimes one side

ne.xt to the tree is closed; the other serves as a doorway. The fireplace

(kho da tla) is at the foot of the tree ; the smoke escapes at the open top
next to the trunk of the tree. The gi-ound is covered with brushes, and

the bed is spread at the low end of the hut, the head end being at the
side remote from the tree. The structure is lashed together.

    When two families desire to inhabit one house, two of these structures

are joined together, so that they stand end to end, and one is built a little
higher than the other (tig. 2). Thus the roof of one side overlaps that of
the other and prevents the entrance of rain. This house has a door on
each vertical side. It is also built close to the butt of a tree as a protec-
tion against snow and rain, the trunk of the tree being close to one of the

vertical sides. When the tribe moves to another camp the houses are
taken apart and the poles are tied together and to a tree. When the

party returns to the same place they untie the bundle and use the same

poles.

     In winter the poles are tied more strongly, and very stout supports

are selected. When the snowfall is very deep the doors are blocked up

and the exit is through the roof. .It would seem very likely that this

winter house may be the primitive form out of which the subterranean

                                 Fig. 2.--Double hut of the Ts'Etsa'ut.

lodge of the interior of British Columbia may have developed. The

advantage of covering the walls with dirt instead of waiting for a snow-
fall, to ensure protection against winds and cold, would become easily
apparent, and then the ground plan of the two houses would become very

much alike. The advantages of the bilateral arrangement would also
disappear when the houses were built underground instead of overground.

I would remark at this place that the supports of the subterranean lodge
are slanting outward, not vertical, as indicated on page G33 of the Sixth
Report of the Committee, and that Dr. Dawson's figure (' Transactions
of the Royal Society of Canada,' 1893, ii.) renders the plan correctly.

     The bed is cover^^d with mats made of cedar-bark. Quilts or blankets
are made of the skins of goats, bear, and marmot. Baskets are used for
cooking and for carrying water, berries, and other kinds of food. They
are made of spruce roots or of bark. Spoons are made of bark or of
mountain-goat horn. Axes and adzes were made of bone or horn.

     Fire was made either by means of the firedrill or with a strike-a-light.
The stone for the latter is found in Tombstone Bay, but the description

of the kind of stone'was too indefinite for the purpose of identification.
ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                         563

The firedrill is turned by means of a bow : the upper end is held in a piece
of bark, while the lower ends turns in a slit of a piece of wood. Dry
rotten wood is used for tinder. The sinew-b?.cked bow was made of yew
wood. There was a stud on the inner side, which served to keep the string
from the bow. The string w-as made of the skin of the back of the
beaver, which was cut into strips and twisted. One end was tied to the
end of the bow, while the other had an eye which was hung over the
other end. Bows of this description are used by the Kenai and the
Tinneh of the Lower Yukon River. The arrow was made of yellow cedar
and winged with eagle feathers. Flint for arrow-heads was obtained

from a place in the mountains north of Laq'uyip'. It is said that the

people made e.xpeditions for obtaining this material, which lasted two
years. The bow is held horizontally. The arrow is grasped by the bent first
finger and thumb of the right hand Sometimes the bow is held vertically.

                          --Fig. 3. Marmot trap.

Then the arrow is grasped by the thumb and first and second fingers of the

right hand, and rests between the first and second fingers of the left. When

hunting they carry their small game in pouches. In winter they travel on

snow-shoes, the netting of which is made of beaver skin. For mountain

climbing they use a pole about three fathoms long (tqe). Marmots are

near the back of the bear are also the backbone ; the lines descending
from it are the ribs. Its mouth is open.

     Porcupines are hunted during the nighttime. They are not caught
in traps, but killed with lances, clubs, or arroMs. It seems that they do

not use nets for catching rabbits. Levi said that the Laq'uyi'p hunted in
this manner, but that the Ts'Ets'a'ut did not do so. They always hunt singly,

one man confining his operations to one valley at a time. They use canoes
to a slight extent only. The canoes were made of the bark of the yellow

cedar. Tliey were about three fathoms long. The bark is stripped all
around the tree. Then it is stretched, sewed in the proper shape, and the
seams and holes are calked with gum. They used sails which were made
of marmot skins.

     In winter they live to a great extent upon meat dried during the
summer months. The staple food is marmot meat, which is mixed with
marmot grease, boiled and preserved in marmot guts.

     The tribe consisted of two clans, the Eagle and the Wolf. Only
members of the Wolf clan survive. The native names of the clans are
lost, and they are called by their Nisk'a equivalents, Laqski'yek and
Laqkyebo'. The equivalent of the latter among the Sa'nak-oan are the

Tek'oede. The clans are exogamic. As members of one clan only survive,

all the married Ts'Ets'a'ut of this time have married members of foreign
tribes. Each clan has separate names. I obtained names of the Laqkyebo'

only.

The institutions are maternal, succession being in the female line.

WeThe child inherits from his mother's brother.  tind among the

Ts'Ets'a'ut also the institution of avoidance between mother-in-law and

son-in law (matuoHa') which is found among all the northern Tinneh

tribes. Levi explained that they were ashamed to talk to each other, and

even to see each other. The mother-in-law leaves the house before the

son-in-law enters, or, if such is impossible, she hides her face or turns the

other way while he is near her. Levi stated that the adult man must

also not look at his adult sister. This custom, he explained, is based on

a tradition according to which a man married his sister. Tljeir brothers

were ashamed, tied them together, and deserted them ; but the man broke

the ropes. They had a child, and eventually he killed a ram, a ewe, and

a kid of the mountain-goat, put on their skins, and they assumed the

shape of goats. He had acquired the power of killing everything by a

glance of his eyes. One day his tribe came up the river for the purpose

of hunting, and he killed them. Then he travelled all over the world,

leaving .signs of his presence everywhere, such as remarkable rocks. The

woman and her child went to the head waters of the JSTass River, where

they still continue to live on a lake.

     I also found the Tinneh custom according to which the parents of a child
change their names and adopt that of father or mother of so-and-so. In this

case at least the custom must be interpreted somewhat differently from
the way in which it is usually done. There are a limited number of

names only in the tribe, probably names belonging to the nobility. When

a child reaches a certain age, his father, uncle, motlier, or aunt may give
                                                                                                                                                                                                              ·

--566 REPORT 1895.

it his or her name ; and since by this act the former owner has relinquished
his place, he also loses the name belonging to the place, and consequently
adopts that of the father, mother, or aunt of the owner of the place, thus

indicating that he owned the place formerly.

    When a woman is about to give birth to a child a separate hut is built
for her. When the child is being born two other women hold a stick

horizontally in front of the mother. She takes hold of it, standing in a

Abent position.  third woman takes hold of the child, covering its mouth

until it is born. The navel-string is tied with sinews, placed on a stick,

and then cut. The mother rests for a day, then she takes up her usual

occupation. After a boy is born the father must not cut oft' the legs of

any kind of male game ; after a girl is born he must not cut off those of

female game, else the private parts of the child would swell.

   A girl when reaching maturity wears a neck-ring of crabapple twigs

(k'!ase'l), earrings of bone, and a piece of a rib around the neck, as amulets

to secure good luck and a long life. She also wears a large skin hat

which comes down over her face, and prevents the sun from striking

it. If she should expose her face to the sun or to the sky, it would
rain. The hat protects her face also against the fire, which must not

strike her skin. For this purpose she also weai'S skin mittens. She

wears the tooth of an animal in her mouth to prevent her teeth from

getting hollow. For a whole year she must not see blood unless her face

is blackened, else she would grow blind. For two years she wears the hat

and lives in a hut by herself, although she is permitted to see others.

After that period a man takes the hat oft" from her head and throws it

away.

    When a young man desires to marry a girl he asks her parents, to

whom he gives presents of meat at intervals during a year. Then the bride's

parents invite him and his clan to a feast at which the marriage is cele-

brated. When a man dies and leaves a widow his brother marries her. He
provides for her during the period of her widowhood. He must not marry

her before the lapse of a certain time, as her husband's ghost stays with

her and as the ghost would do him harm. The widow and also the

widower eat out of a stone dish. She or he carries a pebble in the mouth,

and a straight crabapple stick is placed along the back, inside the jacket.

She sits upright day and night. The meaning of this custom is that her

back shall remain as straight as the crabapple stick even in her old age.

The deceased husband's brother must take care that everything is quiet

in the widow's house. Any person who crosses the hut in front of her

dies. She fasts for two or three days after the death of her husband.

After that she is allowed to eat what she pleases. When a woman dies

and her husband survives, he marries her sister.

    Men must not cut their hair, else they would grow old quickly. Men

and women do not eat the heads of mountain goats, else their hair would

turn grey early.

    In cases of sickness the shaman is called. He sings certain songs.
He does not use a rattle, but only a feather wand, generally an eagle's tail.
His hands and his face are painted red. He fans and blows the patient

'both hands, acting as though he dipped it out, and blows it into the air.

"When a person is about to die his friends leave the house and desert

him. Everything that is in the house is left behind. They are afraid of

ghosts and avoid returning to the same place. Sometimes the body is

placed in a hollow tree and stones are piled up in front of the entrance,

or the butt of a tree is hollowed out on purpose. The knees of the body

are doubled up so that they touch the chin. The relatives of the deceased

cut their hair.

The ceremonial after the death of a chief is somewhat elaborate. The

body is burnt by the clan of which the deceased is not a member. The

chief's clan fast for three days. On the fourth day they partake of a
little water and raw food. On the fifth day they prepare a feast in honour

of their deceased chief. During the feast some food is burnt for him.

Those who buried the body receive blankets in payment. After they

have finished eating they begin to dance. The mourners sit down around

a fire wailing. They wear mittens and cover their mouths with their

hands that the fire may not strike them. The same ceremony is repeated

three times                                                                 the second  time  from  the fifth  to  the  tenth                                                                                        day, and  the
                                                                         ;

third time from the eleventh to the fifteenth day after the death of the

chief                       then they                                       are  clean.       During all this time they do not undress,
                         ;

and keep their hats on. Every morning they wash in sour urine and put

fresh coal on their faces.

     The following tradition illustrates the beliefs of the Ts'nts'a'ut in

Aregard to the abode of the soul after death. ' widow who was with

child was killed by a brancli striking her abdomen. Before dying she

gave birth to two girls. Her sister adopted the children and reared them.

In the spring of the year the tiibe went up Portland Inlet to catch

olachen. The woman with her two children could not travel as quickly

as the others did and lagged behind. One night she was unable to reach

the camp of the tribe, and when it grew dark she made a hut and camped

with the two girls. They had nothing to eat and the children were

crying. After some time they fell asleep. All of a sudden the woman awoke,

and on looking around found herself in a village. It was a beautiful village.

There were two rows of huts, one on each side of a river. She entered a

house and saw her sister and her sister's husband. Then she knew that she

was in the village of the ghosts. She began to cry and her sister cried with

her. She told her sister that she had not been aljle to follow the tribe and

that she and the children were .starving. Then the ghost left the house and

re-entered carrying a bag of marmot-guts filled with marmot meat and

grease. She gave the bag and a dish to her sister to take them home. She

told her that the meat would last her a long time. The woman took the bag
568 REPORT--1895.

and the dish and went home. The trail led up the river through a beautiful

valley. Finally she came to a pass leading across the mountains. As
soon as she reached this place she fainted. When she awoke she found

herself in her hut. The two girls were asleep, and the bag and the dish
which the ghost had given her stood next to them. She gave them some
meat and told them that she had been to the village of the ghosts who
had given her provisions. The next morning they proceeded on their
journey and finally reached the tribe. The meat in the bag did not grow
less although they were using it all the time. She told the people of her
adventure and showed them the dish, which diSered in shape from the
dishes of the Ts'Ets'a'ut. They lived on the meat for a whole year and it
did not grow less. The girls became stout because they were always well
nourished. The aunt and the two girls married. After some time the aunt's

husband was lost when hunting porcupine. When he did not return the
people went to look for him, but they could not find him. On returning

they told the widow to go once more to the village of the ghosts in order to
see if her husband were dead. She lay down to sleep, and when she awoke
she found herself on the pass which she had crossed before. She saw the
village down below in a beautiful valley on both sides of a river. While
it was winter on earth it was summer here. She reached the village and
entered her sister's hut. She told her that she herself and her nieces had
married and that she had come to look for her lost husband. Then her
sister cried and told her that her husband was in tlie hut next door where

he stayed with his parents. The woman said : " He took a belt and a
marmot-skin blanket away which belong to my child. I wish to take
them home." Her sister replied : " He had them on when I saw him." Then
the woman went into the hut next door and found her husband lying near

 the fire. She saw his parents and others of his deceased relatives. Then

she asked him for the belt and the blanket, and he gave them to her. He

 also told her the place where his body was lying. It was at the foot of a
 mountain where they had camped before. There was a little boy in
 the hub who ran up and down in front of the woman. She grew angry

 and pushed him so that he fell into the fire. He vanished, for if a ghost
 is killed, he is destroyed entirely and he ceases to exist. The woman ran

 out of the house and at once she awoke in her own hut. It was early in
 the morning. The blanket lay next to her. The belt was on the ground,
 but one half of it was still in the ground and the people were unable to
 pull it out. She reported what her husband had told her, and when the
 people went to look for the body of her husband tliey found it at the place
 indicated by the ghost. The head was frozen to the ice, while the lower
 part of the body was moving. They tried to free it from the ice, but they
 were unable to do so. Then they cut wood and burnt the body right

 where it lay.'

      I did not obtain much information in regard to their games and
 pastimes. Levi insisted that he had never seen a Ts'Ets'a'ut gambling
 and knew only a game at ball played with a ball of cedar-bark, and the
 game of cat's-cradle. Hunters, who desire to secure good luck, fast and
 wash their bodies with ginger-root for three or four days and do not touch
 a woman for two or three months. They drink decoctions of ' devil's

 club ' for purposes of purification and for securing good luck.
       Their traditions are remarkable on account of the slight influence of

 the coast tribes upon them. The Rev. F. Maurice has pointed out that the
 customs and traditions of the Tinneh of the interior of British Columbia,
                          CN THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.    569

namely, of the Chilcotin, Carrier, and Siccanie, have been influenced to a

considerable extent by the coast tribes.'

The mythology of the Ts'Ets'a'ut agrees closely with that of the

northern and eastern Tinneh tribes, which were studied by E. Petitot.

Without entering into details I will mention a few of the fundamental

traits of their traditions. The earth was originally level : it was hot,

there was neither water, rain, snow, fog, nor wind. The animals were

starving and tore the sky, went up and liberated rain, snow, and wind',

which were kept in bags in the house of the goose woman. Rivers originated

when a man, in order to obtain water, shot an arrow into the ground,

whereupon a spring welled up. Mountains originated when two brothers

flew from their giant wives, who pursued them. In order to obstruct

their progress they threw the contents of the stomach of a cai-iboo upon

the ground. These were transformed into mountains and valleyc. Later

on a flood destroyed all the people : only children of two clans survived,

who were placed by their parents inside two trees. The fire was

originally in possession of the grizzly bear, who wore a strike-a-light as an
Aear-ornament.
                          bird stole it and brought the stones to men. Glaciers

and snow on the mountains are the remains of an immense snowfall which

covered the whole world. There are a great many traditions telling of

Athe marriage of men lo women who were animals or other beings.

people of cannibals of human form, but with faces of dogs, called Qudii'le,

and giants called Tsufa', are the subjects of many tales.

                          IV. The Nass Eiver Indians, the NIsk-a'.

The customs of the Nisk"a' and those of the Tsimshian, which were

described in the Fifth Report of the Committee, are practically identical.

Therefore I will not enter into a detailed description of this tribe, but

give such data only as supplement my previous notes. The Nisk-a' speak

one of the three main dialects of the Tsimshian language; the other dialects

are the Tsimshian and the Gyitkshan. They inhabit Nass River, except

its upper course. Nowadays they live in a great many permanent

villages, but formerly only four subdivisions were recognised by them.

Laqk-'altsa'p (=at the town), Andeguale', Gyitwunkse'tlk, and Gyit'-

laqda'miks. I mentioned in my former report that the Tsimshian are

divided into four clans : The K-anha' da, or Raven ; the Laqkyebo', or

Wolf                      the Laqski'yek, or Eagle ;  and the GyispawaduwE'da,^ or Bear.
                       ;

I discovered that these clans are subdivided or specialised, there being-

families of the clan at large, and subdivisions of the clan. Among the'
Nisk'a'and Gyitksha'n I found the following subdivisions :--

    ' The Kev. F. Maurice misunderstands me when he assumes that I think the coast

people have not influenced the tribes of the interior. This influence is apparent in
all the descriptions of former travellers, and has been admirably demonstrated by
Mr. Maurice. But the reverse influence exists also, and has aflected to the greatest

extent theThngit tribes who trade with the interior, the Tsimshian, the Bilqula, and
the Salish of the interior. The flood legends whicli refer to the finding of the earth
by the musk rat, some of the burial customs and inventions, mast have percolated
through these channels, even if tlie Tinneh tribes have lost some of those customs
owing to secondary changes.

     ^ This spelling is more correct than GyispotuwE'da, as given formerly.

      These totemic subdivisions are not represented in all the villages of
the tribe, but are found as follows :

      These are the old recognised subdivisions of the Nisk'a' which were

given to me by ' Chief Mountain,' and corroborated in part by other

 members nf the tribe. It is remarkable that in olden times the
 GyispawaduwE'da, who are nowadays the most numerous clan, appear
 confined to a single village. It is possible that the clan became more
 numerous owinsr to intermarriage with the Tsimshian.

   considered a separate tribe, and whose dialect is intermediate between the
   Nisk-a' and the Gyitkshan. They have two clans : the K-anha'da and

   Laqkyebo'.

       ' Chief Mountain ' gave me the following subdivisions of the Gyikshan ;

   the list is, however, incomplete :

                                I. Gyitwung'a',

   Raven : K'anha'da.

   Eagle : Laqski'yek.

                                II. Gyitsigyu'ktla.

   Raven : K'anha'da.
   Bear : Gyisg-'a'hast,

                               III. Gyispayo'kc.

   Raven : K'anha'da.
   Wolf : Laqkyebo.'

                           IV. Gyit'anma'kys.

        The subdivisions of a clan cannot intermarry with the main clan or
   with any other of its subdivisions. The people form four exogamic
   groups only : Raven, Wolf, Eagle, and Bear. Of these the Bear is con-
   sidered the noblest clan, because it derives its origin from Heaven.

        In all festivals the totems of the clan play an important part. Carv-
   ings representing the totem are worn as masks or head-dresses ; they are
   painted or carved on houses and utensils, and on memorial columns and
   totem poles. In all initiations an artificial totem animal brings back the

   novice. I made particular inquiries regarding the meaning of masks and
   carvings, and the modes of their use. I shall next give what new informa-

   tion I obtained on these points.

       When the Gyituk-'adok- branch of the K-anha'da have a potlach,

   thi'ee masks make their appearance, one of which has a moustache and
   represents a young man named Gyitgoo'yim, while the other two are
   called Ca'ca. They represent the following tradition. While the people

   were staying at the fishing village Gulgye'utl, the boys under the leader-

   ship of a young man named Gyitgod'yim made a small house in the

   woods behind the town. They took a spring salmon along and played
   with it until it was rotten. They caught small fish in the creek and
   split and dried them. They made small drums and began to sing and
   to dance. For four days they stayed there, dancing all the time. Then
   they became supernatural beings. Gyitgoo'yim's hair had turned into
   crystal and copper. The people were about to move to another camp,
   and went to the place where they heard the boys singing.

being.

As soon as the people approached them they disappeared and were

seen at once dancing and singing at a distant place. They were unable

to reach them. Then they returned, and since that time they have used

the song and dance of these boys.

The GyispawaduwE'da have one head-dress representing an owl

[Mdskutgimu ks) surrounded by many small human heads called gyadEin

tlak's (claw-men). This is %vorn in potlaches and commemorates the

Afollowing tradition.         chief at T'Emlaq'a'mt had a son who was crying

all the time. His father became impatient and sent him out of the

house saying, ' The white owl shall fetch you.' The boy went out,

accompanied by his sister. Then the owl came and carried the girl to

the top of a tree. The people heard her crying and tried to take her

down, but they were unable to climb the tree. After a while she ceased

to cry and married the owl. They had a son. When he grew up she

told her husband that she desired to send her son home. Then his

father made a song for him. His mother told him to carve a head-dress

in the shape of an owl for use in his dance and to sing the song which

his father had made for him. She bade him good-bye and said that her

husband was about to carry her to a far-ofT country. The owl carried

both of them to the old chief's house. When his wife saw the unknown

boy she was afraid, but her daughter addressed her, saying that the boy

was her grandson. Then the old woman took him into her house v>'hil?

the boy's mother and the owl disappeared. When the boy was grown

up his mother's brother gave a potlach, and before the blankets were dis-

tributed the boy danced, wearing the owl head-dress and singing the song

which his father had made for him.

Some of the dances ai"e actual mimical representations of myths.

In one ceremony two men dressed like Ts'Ets'a'ut hunters appear. Sud-

denly the noise of thunder is heard, and down through the I'oof comes a

person dressed in eagle skins and wearing the mask of the thunder

bird. The Ts'Ets'a'ut shoot at the bird. At once there is a flash of

lightning and a clap of thunder : one of the men falls dead and the other

one escapes The tire is extinguished by means of water, which wells up

through a pipe of kelp which is laid underground and empties into the

fire. At the same time water is thrown upon the spectators through

the roof. This performance is accompanied by the song of the women,

who sit on three platforms in the rear of the house. The song relates to

the myth which is represented in the performance.

  --Burial. The burial is attended to by members of the clan of the

father of the deceased, who are paid for their services. Four or five
men bend the head of the body down and his knees up. Thus he is

placed in a box. Chiefs lie in state for some days, while others are

buried without delay. They burn food and clothing for the deceased,

saying that it is intended for him. Else the ghost would trouble them.

Then they cut wood for  a     pyre                      the  box                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   is  put  on  top  of  it  and  it  is

burnt. The body is poked with long poles in order to facilitate com-

bustion. "When it bursts and gas escapes they believe they hear the

voice of the ghost. Men and women sit around the pyre and sing all

the cradle songs of the clan which are contained in their legends. The

remains are put into a small box and placed on trees. Cotton -wood trees

are often selected for this purpose. The body of the shaman is also

burnt.

     Some time after the burial the son or nephew of the deceased
erects a column in his memory (ptsdn). As the meaning of such

columns is not yet clear by any means, I asked ' Chief Mountain ' to

describe to me the festivals which he gave after the death of his father,

who was a GyispawaduwE'da. His father had a squid for his protector

(riEqnok-). After the death of his father he invited all the people to

his house. During the festival the ground opened and a huge rock

which was covered with kelp came out. This was made of wood and
Abark.
        cave was under the rock and a large squid came out of it.

It was made of cedar bark and its arms were set with hooks which

caught the blankets of the audience and tore them. The song of the

squid which was sung by the women sitting on three platforms in the rear

of the house is as follows :

--574 REPORT 1895.

    After the squid and the rock had disappeared a man wearing the
sun mask appeared in the door, and when the people began to sing his

song a movable sun which was attached to the mask began to turn. The
sun belongs to the GyispawaduwE'da ; the squid reminds the people that
one of his father's ancestors when hunting squids at ebb tide was cap-
tured by a huge animal. His friends tried to liberate him, but were

unable to do so. When the water began to rise they pulled a bag of

sea-lion guts over his head, hoping that the air in it might enable him to
survive, but when they looked for him at the next tide they found him

dead.

     After the festival ' Chief Mountain ' erected the memorial column.

It represented, from below upwards, first four men called Loayo'k-s, or

the commanders. These are a crest of the GyispawaduwE'da. Tradition

says that one night some men for some purpose dug a hole behind a

house near a grave-tree. They saw an open place in the woods, a fire in
the middle, and ghosts were dancing around it wearing head-dresses.

They were sitting there as though they were in a house, but the men
saw only a pole where the door of this house would have been. Four men

called Loayo'k's were standing at the door, and called to them nagivVt
(To this side ) Since that time the GyispawaduwE'da have used these

                                                                                                 !

figures.

    On top of the four men was the sea-bear (niF.di'ek Em akys) with

three fins on his back. Each fin had a human face at its base. His
father had requested him to put the killer whale on the column, but

he preferred to place the sea-bear on it because it is the highest crest

of the GyispawaduwE'da. The tradition of the sea-bear tells how four
brothers went down Skeena River and were taken to the bottom of the
sea by Hagula'k-, a sea monster, over whose house they had anchored.
His house had a number of platforms. Inside were the killer whales,

Hagula'k-'s men. He had four kettles, called Lukewarm, Warm, Hot,

Boiling, and a hat in shape of a sea monster, with a number of rings
on top. The name of his house was Helahai'dEk- (near the Haida

country). He gave the brothers the right to use all these objects, and

with them their songs, which are sung at all great ceremonies of the
clan. The song of the house is as follows :

M^E^ ?2Z               X ^Sg^^EB^  :^i=P

                                       ^1i2=tS:

     Hagula'k- also gave them two cradle songs, which are sung for
children of the clan and also at f unei'als.

  --Marriage. When a young man desires a girl for his wife he sends a

certain amount of property (hana'k's) to her parents for the purchase of
the girh If the suitor and tlie amount of property are acceptable, they

send word to him stating that they accept his suit. Then the young man
takes a number of slaves, who accompany him. They are called lodd'mEk-s-

gut (= always close to him). They arm themselves, and the young man
embarks with them in a canoe and sails to the bride's house. As soon as

her relatives see them coming, they arm themselves with clubs and stone
hammers and rush down to the landing-place. They break the canoe and

try to drive off the companions of the young man. They fight seriously,

and sometimes one of the lodd'viF.k-sgut is killed. This foretells that the

couple will never part. After the tight is over the bridegroom and his
companions are carried into the bride's house. Then her friends strew
eagle down, which is kept in a bag made of sea-lion's intestines, on the
companions of the bridegroom, and the fighting ceases. Her father puts
on his head-dress and dances while her friends sing. Then a feast is given,

during which the young man pays the remainder of the purchase money.

In the evening the girl's clan gives a considerable amount of property to
the bridegroom {logyinam), which he distributes among his clan according
to the amount which they have contributed to the purchase money. Her
father and brothers give the groom a new canoe in place of the one which
was broken in the morning. Then the bride is carried down to the canoe
and she departs with her husband to his village, where they live.

      If the groom belongs to the same village, the couple often stay with the

girl's parents.

   --The ivinter ceremonial. I did not see any part of the winter ceremonial

of the Nisk'a', but I received descriptions which, in the light of our

knowledge of these ceremonies among the Kwakiutl, bring out suflSciently

clearly their similarities. There are si.x; secret societies among the Nisk-a',

which rank in the following order : the SEmhalai't, Meitla', LotlE'ni,

Olala', Nanesta't, Honana'tl, the last being the highest. The SEmhalai't
is really not confined to the winter ceremonial, but is obtained when
a person obtains the first guardian spirit of his clan and performs the
 ceremony belonging to this event. 'The tradition of the origin of these
ceremonies is the same as that found among the Tsimshian, to which I
 alluded in the Fifth Report of the Committee, p. 853 (see the full
legend in 'Zeitschrift fiir Ethnologic,' 1888). The version of the legend
which I obtained from the Nisk-a' localises the events at Bellabella, and
it is added that the ceremonies were obtained first by the Gyitqa'tla
 (a Tsimshian tribe located on the islands south-west of Skeena River)
--576 KEPORT 1895.

from the Bellabella, and later on by the Nisk-a' from the Gyitqa'tla. This
is corroborated by linguistic evidence. All the names of these societies,

with the exception of the tirst, are of Kwakiutl origin. [Meitla'= teasing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

na'tl, dance of {1 ?). The call of the Olala', hcijj, is also a Kwakiutl
word designating eating.] The original tradition mentions three societies

--only the second, third, fourth. This shows that the first is not a secret

.society, properly speaking, and that the fifth and sixth are later intro-
ductions. The Nisk-a' state that with the ceremonies came the use of large

whistles. The Kwakiutl of Fort Rupert state also that the use of large
whistles and the custom of eating slaves and corpses and of biting pieces

Weof flesh out of the arms of people came to them from the He'iltsuk.

must assume, therefore, that these ceremonies originated in the region of

Milbank Sound. As the legends of these societies throw a clear light

upon their practices, I will give the Nisk-a' tradition of the origin of the

secret societies in full.

   A Wutsda' (Bellabella) named Sagaitla'bEn (a Nisk-a' name) went

hunting. He saw a bear, which he pursued. He shot it several times, but was

unable to kill it. Finally the bear reached a steep cliff which opened and
let him in. As soon as he entered he heard the voices of the Olala'
calling ' hap,' and he fainted. Then his soul was taken into the house.
In the rear of the house he saw a large room partitioned ofl". The par-
tition was hung with red cedar-bark. It was the secret room of the Olala'
(j)ta6tl). To the right of the door, on entering, was a secret room for the
Meitla', and to the left of the door one for the LotlE'm. The chief, who
was sitting in the rear of the house, ordered a fire to be made, and spoke :
' Those here are the Meitla' ; they did not bring you here. Those are the
LotlE'm ; they eat dogs ; they did not bring you here. But these are the

Olala' ; they eat men ; they brought you here. You shall imitate what
they are doing.' He had a heavy ring of red cedar-bark around his neck,
a ring of the same material on his head, and wore a bearskin. He said :
* You must use the same ornaments when you return to your people.' He
took a whistle out of his own mouth and gave it to Sag-aitla'bEn. He gave

him his small neck-ring of cedar-bark, which instilled into him the desire
of devouring men (therefore it is called k-'dtsq F.m Ion, cedar- bark throat),
and he gave him large cedar-bark rings and a small bearskin, which

enabled him to fly. He told him: ' You shall kill men, you shall eat them,
and carry them to my house.' Then he opened the door. The singers

sang and beat time, and Sag-aitla'bEn flew away from town to town

over the whole woi-ld, crying ' hap ' all the time. He went from the

country of the Wutsda to Skeena River and to Nass River. Sometimes

he was seen sitting on high clifls. He killed and devoured people whom

he found in the woods.
      After three years he was seen near the village of the Gyit'ama't.

They attempted to catch him. They killed dogs and threw them into a
hole, and a number of shamans hid under a canoe near by. Soon he was

heard to approach. He alighted on the top of a dry cedar. He lay there

on his stomach, and the point of the tree was seen to penetrate his body

and to pierce it. But it did not kill him. When he saw the dogs he flew

down, and, after having eaten, the .shamans rushed up to him, caught him,
and took him up to the house. They tried to cure him, and the people

sang Olala' songs, all of which have a five-part rhythm (J J JY He

tried to fly again, but was unable to get out of the house. Finally he was
tamed and became a man. Then the Gyit'ama't took him back to his
home and received in return many slaves, coppers, and canoes.

     The ceremonies take place in the month Lok^s Ein giinaqk (cold month,

or December).

     The LotlE'm dance in a two-part rhythm : their call is a sharp h, h
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

their movements sudden jerks of the foreai-ms, first the left moving up to
the shoulder, while the right moves down, then vice versa.

     The Meitla' dance in a three-part rhythm. The last two dances

correspond to the Nontsista'latl of the Kwakiutl. When the members of

these societies are in a state of ecstasy, they throw fire around and knock
to pieces canoes, houses, and anything they can lay their hands on.

     The insignia of the societies are made of cedar-bark dyed red in a
decoction of alder-bark. For each repetition of the ceremony a new ring is
added to the head ornament of the dancer. Those of tlie LotlE'm and

Olala' consist therefore of rings placed one on top of the other, while the

Meitla' receives first a red ring, the second time a white ring, and so on
alternating. His rings are twisted together.

     There are only a limited number of places in the societies, and a new
member can be admitted only when he inherits the place of a deceased
member, or if a member transfers his place to him. If such a transfer is

to take place, the consent of the chiefs of the clans must first be obtained..
Then one evening the chiefs during a feast surround the youth and act as
though they had caught the spirit of the society in their hands and throw
it upon the novice. If he is to be a LotlE'm, a noise : hou, hou, is heard
on the roof of the house, and the youth faints. The LotlE'm (or the
members of the society in which he is to be initiated) are called to

investigate why the youth fainted. They enter singing, their heads

covered with down. They place him on an elk-skin, carry him around the
fire, then they throw the youth upward and show the people that he is
lost. After some time, when the novice is expected back, the people
assemble in the house, and all the members of the nobility try to bring him
back by the help of their spirits. In order to do this they dance with the
head ornaments of their clans, their rattles, dancing blankets, aprons and
leggings, or they use the head ornament representing two bears' ears,,
which is made of bearskin set with woman's hair, which is dyed red : this
ornament is used by all clans ; or they wear masks representing their
guardian spirits {nEqno't). As an example of these I will describe the
spii'it of sleep (woq) which belongs to the GyispawaduwE'da. The owner

of this spirit appears sleeping, his face covered with a mask, the eyes of

which are shut. Then a chief steps up and tries to awake him by hauling
the drowsiness out of him with both his hands. Then the eyes of the

mask are opened, and roll while the man who wears the mask rises. The
chief who took the drowsiness out of him asks if he shall try to put the

people to sleep, and on being asked to do so he throws his hands open.
The riEqno'k- is supposed to enter the people, and all close their eyes.
After some time he gathers the drowsiness again, and they awake and

sing :--

In this manner the spirit of sleep proves his presence and is asked to

try to bring back the novice.
     One nEqnd'h after the other tries to bring him back. If the novice

does not return by midnight of the first night, the ceremony is interrupted

and continued the following night. On one occasion a member of the
LotlE'm was the last to try. He took his nnqnu'k', a small carved human

image, held it up, and asked it to bring back the novice. Then he poured
a spoonful of grease into the fii^e and threw the carving after it. At once

the whistles of the novice were heard on the roof. All the LotlE'm

rushed out of the house, but soon they returned, saying that they had

seen him, but lost him again. They cried, ' eh I ' (drawn out very long).

Then all the people left the house. After the novice is lost in this manner

he is expected back on the following day. Early in the morning a killer-

whale or some other animal is seen on the river carrying the novice on

his back. He is crying md, met, md, md I all the time, and the people go

to see him. The LotlE'm take a canoe and paddle, singing, towards the

novice. When they have almost reached him one of their number, who

stays ashore and wears a bearskin, drives all the people into the houses.

The LotlE'm take the novice into their canoe and destroy the whale float

which carries him, and which is manipulated by means of ropes. Then

he runs up and down the street like one wild, and the Olala' follow him
and bite any of the profane who dare to leave the house. The novice

catches a dog, tears it to pieces, and eats it going from house to house.

When returning he is naked. Then they enter his house, which becomes

Atabooed.  rope hung with red cedar-bark is stretched from the door of

the house to a pole erected on the beach, preventing the people from pass-

Aing in front of the house and com^^elling them to go behind.                                                                                                                                             large ring

of cedar-bark is fastened to the pole in front of the house. These remain

on the house for a day after the return of the novice. On the following
day four men put on bearskins and place rings of red cedar-bark on

their heads. Thus attired they go from house to house inviting the

people to see the dance of the novice and to learn his songs. When the

people have assembled, the uncle of the novice throws blankets on the ground,

on which the novice dances. Then his uncle pays the chiefs who tried to

bring him back, and distributes blankets among the other people also. He

gives a feast consisting of two kinds of berries, each mixed with grease.

Chiefs are given large spoons filled with grease. Their people help them

to empty the contents, as they must not leave any of the food that they

receive. After the ceremony the novice is called tlaamgya't (a perfect

man).

The man who wants to become a member of the Olala' must have been

a halai't (shaman) first.

The following description of the initiation of an Olala' was given by a

man who had gone through the ceremony himself, but who is a Christian
now. It is a question to my mind if the ceremonies at the grave about
which he told me were actually performed, or if he reflected only the

dread in which the Olala' were held.
ON THE NORTH-WESTERX TRIBES OF CANADA        579

     During a festival when he was to be initiated his friends pretended to
begin a quarrel. They drew knives and pretended to kill him. They let
him disappear and cut off the head of a dummy, which was skilfully intro-
duced. Then they laid the body down, covered it, and the women began
to mourn and to wail. His relatives gave a feast, distributed blankets,
slaves, canoes, and coppers, and burnt the body. In short, they held a

regular funeral.

    After his disappearance he resorted to a grave. He took the body out

·of the grave and wrapped a blanket about himself and the body. Thus
he lay with the corpse for a whole night. The other Olala' watched him
from a distance. In the morning he put the body back into the grave.

He continued to do so for some time in order to acquire courage. All

this time, and for a whole year, he was not seen by any member of the

tribe except by the Olala'.

   A year after his disappearance his nephew invited all the tribes to

bring him back. This was done in the same manner as described above
in the case of initiation of the LotlE'm. Finally his whistles were heard,

and he appeared on the roof of the house crying « lalalalala ! He dis-

appeared again, and in the following night after prolonged dances he was
seen on the hills dancing in a fire, which he had built in such a manner
that when he danced behind it it looked from the village as though he
was standing right in it. The following day he appeared carried by his

totem animal.

     The GyispawaduwE'da are brought back by a killer- whale, as described
above ; the Laqkyebo' by a bear ; the Laqski'yek appear on the back of
an eagle which rises from underground ; the K-anha'da on the back of a
frog. Sometimes the novice appears on a point of land some distance from
the village carrying a corpse in his arms. Then he is said to walk over

the surface of the water and to come ashore in front of the village. This
is accomplished by means of a raft which is covered with planks, and

burdened so that it floats a short distance under thesurface of the water.

It is pulled by means of a rope by some of the other Olala' while the novice

is dancing on it, so that the impression is conveyed that he has approached

on the surface of the water. When he reaches the village he eats of the

body which he is carrying, and one or other of the chiefs kills a slave
and throws the body to the Olala', who devour it. It is said that before

eating human flesh the Olala' always use emetics, and that afterwards

they tickle their throats with feathers to ensure vomiting.

     In festivals which take place during the dancing season the Olala'
receives his share first, and nobody is allowed to eat until he has begun to

eat. He has his own dish and spoon, which are wound round with bark.

Those who have been Olala' formerly are his servants and bring him food.

When he hears the word lo'ltk (ghost) he gets excited and begins to bite
again. After he ceases to bite and to devour men a heavy ring of red

cedar-bark is placed around his neck, and he is led slowly round the fire.
The ceremony is called ' making him heavy ' (sEp'a lytq), and serves to

prevent his flying away and getting excited again. He must stay in his

room for a whole year after his initiation. After biting he must chew the

bark of ' devil's club ' (woO'inst), which acts as a purgative.'

     In olden times the appearance of the artificial totem animal, or of the
guardian spirit, which was described above, was considered a matter of

great importance, and any failure which would disclose the deception to

the uninitiated was considered a great misfortune, which was atoned only

by the death of those involved in the disclosure. One striking instance

of an event of this kind which took place among the Heiltsuk- was

reported to me. Three brothers invited all the tribes, among them the

Tsimshian, to a festival. The eldest was to return from a visit to the

bottom of the sea. When the visitors landed they had to wait on the

Abeach for his return.  rock was seen to emerge at some distance from

the shore. It opened and the young man stepped out and danced,

adorned with his headdress. Then he stepped back into the rock, which
disappeared again in the waters. The rock was made of wood and
covered with kelp. Its movements were regulated by means of ropes
running to the woods where a number of men were hidden, who operated

them. After the rock had emerged twice the ropes became entangled, and

they were unable to make it emerge for the third time. The man who
was hidden in the rock was drowned. The family of the man who was

lost in this manner concealed their grief, and his brothers pretended that

he had stayed with the spirit residing at the bottom of the sea. They

went through the whole festival. After the guests had departed all the

surviving meml)ers of the family tied themselves to a long rope, sang the

cradle song of their family, and precipitated themselves from a cliff into

the sea.

   --Shamanism. In reply to my questions regarding the acquisition of

supernatural helpers and the powers of the shaman (lialai't), ' Chief

Mountain,' who is nowadays a regular attendant at church, gave me the
following account of his own experience. Only a man whose father was a
shaman can become a shaman. When he himself was a youth the super-
natural beings (nEqn.o'k') were pursuing him all the time. One day a

beautiful girl appeared to him and he fainted. She taught him her song

which enabled him to make the olachen come in spring, and which is as

follows :

               Lawc'tl n-iil liaqluV /jurnqtl  altys  atl Irigi/c'wvtl.

               Behold vviiere  meet            the waters on the beach.

                                 Gyitwulgi/ifiyil' mlt' rvulod'citl Jrdt cnhj.

                   (People of warm place) where is heart olachen.

I.e. Behold where the tides meet at Gyitwulgyigya'mk' are manj' olachen.

She wanted to have intercourse with him. One night she took him

through a fire, and since that time he was able to handle fire with im-

punity. AVhen she left him he saw that she had an otter tail. Her name

was KcEinwa'tsq (land- otter woman).

    She is a nEqnoh of the Laqskl'yek clan. When he gave a festival
he danced with the mask of this nEqyiok-. He was covered with otter
skins and wore claws of copper. He moved around the fire like an otter

crying ' uhuid'. This ceremony is called the SEmhalaif. Later on he saw
four other supernatural beings, who had the shape of wild-looking men,

who wore bearskins and crowns made of the claws of bears. They taught
him to foresee sickness. At one time the Gyitqade'q disbelieved his power

over fire. He asked them to build a large fire. He threw an iron hoop

into it, moistened his hands, and covered his face, hair, and hands with

eagle-down. Then he stepped barefooted over the glowing embers, took

the redhot hoop, and carried it through the fire without burning his

hands or his feet. He added that a few years ago he repeated this
ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.               581

experiment, but as he failed and burnt his hands and feet he gave up his

supernatural helper and became a Christian. He also added that many

who pretend to be shamans have no supernatural helpers at all. They

cannot cure or foresee disease. When he was called to cure disease the

four supernatural men appeared to him and helped him. They told him

to draw the breath of the supernatural beings out of the body of the

patient. Other shamans suck the disease out of the body. They pointed

Aout witches to him, and enabled him to see ghosts.  few years ago a

number of shamans were dancing in a house. When he entered he saw a

ghost dancing among them, and foretold at once the death of one of the

shamans. Indeed, after a few hours one of them died. The shaman

wears stone and bone amulets, and does not cut his hair. His appearance

is the same as that of the Tlingit shaman.

      Witchcraft is practised by people called Halda'wit. They steal a

Aportion of a corpse, which they place in a small, long, watertight box.

stick is placed across the middle of the box, and thin threads are tied to

this stick. The piece of corpse is placed at the bottoni of the box,

and part of the clothing or hair of the person whom the Halda'wit desire

 to bewitch is tied to thin strings. If it is in immediate contact with the

 body the person will die soon ; if it is hung a little higher he will be sick

for a long time. If hair is put into the box he will die of headache ; if

part of a_ moccasin, his foot will rot ; if saliva is used he will die of

consumption. If the person is to die at once the Haldd'wit cuts the

string from which the object is suspended, so that it drops right on to the

corpse. This box has a cover, and is kept closely tied up. It is kept

buried under the house or in the woods. After the Haldd'icit has killed
his enemy he must go around the house in which the dead one is lying,

following the course of the sun. After his enemy is buried he must lie
down on the grave and crawl around it, again following the course of the
sun, and attired in the skin of some animal. If they do not do this they
must die. Therefore the Nisk-a' watch if they see anyone performing this

ceremony. Then they know that he is a Haldd'ioit, and he is killed. He

is not tied and exposed on the beach at the time of low water, as is done

.by the Tlingit. When a corpse is burnt i\ie Haldd'toit tries to secure

some of the charred remains and uses them for painting his face. This is

supposed to secure good luck. The Haldd'wit sometimes assemble in the
woods, particularly when dividing a body. Then they cover their faces

with masks, so that a person who should happen to come near may not
know them. If anyone should happen to see them they try to catch him
and make him a Haldd'wit also. If he refuses to join them he is killed.
Once a man by the name of K-'amwa'skye was caught in this manner.

He pretended to accept, and was given a mask. They made a song and

sang while he danced

Tarj-ahO'dd ImVIeIi-c,
^^ 'Uwula'ns K'amwd'sliyH,

Ki.e. the ghosts run to the beach on account of the winds of 'amwa'skye.

He emitted winds while he was dancing. He danced, hidden behind the

trees. Then he turned his mask round so that it was on his occiput, and

made good his escape. He reached his house, told what he had seen, and

the Halda'tvit were killed.

     The similarity between this method of witchcraft and the e'ta of the
Kwakiutl (Sixth Report, p. 613) is striking.

    As in olden times cremation was prevalent, they tried to secure
                                      -- ----

582 REPORT-- 1895.

bodies of persons who had died by accident before they were found by
the friends of the deceased. They sold them among the other Halda'wit.
There are, however, many tales which mention the use of bodies for

supernatural purposes as well as tree burial, such as is practised by the
southern tribes. For this reason I suppose that the custom of cremating
the body was borrowed recently from the Tlingit.

     The following tale explains the ideas of the Nisk-a' regarding the

future life.

Once upon a time the GyispawaduwE'da killed Adina'ky, the chief of

the Laqkyebo.' There was a youth living in their town who happened

to walk towards the graveyard chewing gum. There he saw a man
approaching him, who wore a robe of marten skins. When he came

nearer he saw that he was no other than the dead chief. The youth wished

to run away, but the ghost overtook him and asked him for some of the

gum he was chewing. The youth did not dare to hand it to him, and just

pushed it out of his mouth. The ghost took it and turned back. The

youth went home, and after he had told what had happened, he fell down and

lay there like one dead. He had a perforated stone for an amulet, which

he wore suspended from his neck. It was to insure him long life. His

friends washed the body and put clean clothing upon him. Meanwhile

the ghost carried his soul away. They followed a broad trail, and came

to a river. He got tired of waiting, and yawned. Then he heard a noise

Aiia the town.  canoe came across to fetch him. He went aboard, and

was taken to the chief's house. He was sick, and the chief ordered him

to be laid down next to the fire, and called four shamans, who were to

heal him. They tried to take his heart out of his body, but they were

unsuccessful. They said, ' His breast is as hard as stone.' This was

because he wore the amulet. Finally the chief said to the shamans, ' Let

us give up our efforts. He is too powerful ; we must send him back.'
Then he was taken back to the canoe, and sent across the river. He

returned tlie same way which he had come, and when he entered his house

life was restored to the body.

     The conception of the world is as follows :

    The earth is carried by a man named Am'ala' (smoke-hole). He lies

on his back, and holds on his chest a spoon made of the horn of the
mountain goat. It is filled with grease, and in it stands a pole on which

the earth is resting. When he gets tired he lifts the pole, and the earth

shakes. The pole, with the earth on it, is turning in the bowl of the
spoon. The grease in it serves to make it turn easily. The earth is

round. Sun, moon, and stars belong to the sky, and do not turn with the

earth.

    An eclipse of the sun indicates that a chief is to die. Then the whole

tribe go out of the house and sing .

    The following games were described to me :

      1. Leha'l : the guessing game, in which a bone wrapped in cedar-bark
is hidden in one hand. The player must guess in which haiad the bone is

hidden.

     2. Qsan : guessing game played with a number of maple sticks marked

with red or black rings, or totemic designs. Two of these sticks are

trumps. It is the object of the game to guess in which of the two bundles

of sticks, which are wrapped in cedar-bark, the trump is hidden. Each

player uses one trump only.

   --3. Matsqa'n. About thirty small maple sticks are divided into four or

five lots of unequal numbers. After a first glance one of the players is

blindfolded, the other changes the order of the lots, and the first player

must guess how many sticks are now in each lot. When he guesses right

--in three, four, or five guesses out of ten according to the agreement of

--the players he has won.

     4. Gontl : a ball game. There are two goals, about 100 to 150 yards
apart. Each is formed by two sticks, about ten feet apart. In the

middle, between the goals, is a hole in which the ball is placed. The

players carry hooked sticks. Two of them stand at the hole, the other

players of each party, six or seven in number, a few steps behind them

towards each goal. At a given signal both players try to strike the ball

out of the hole. Then each party tries to drive it through the goal of the

opposing party.

5. Tlet! : a ball game. Four men stand in a square : each pair, stand-

ing in opposite corners, throw the ball one to the other, striking it with

their hands. Those who continue longest have won.

ice of the river. The board is held in the left, and stemmed against the

foot. Then the string is pulled through the hole with the right. Several
men begin spinning at a signal. The one whose top spins the longest

wins.

                                  V. LINGUISTICS.

                                            I. NISK-A'.

    The Niska' does not differ very much from the Tsimshian. There are certain
regular changes of sounds-- which, however, are not yet sufficiently clear to me, but
some of which will become apparent by a glance at the comparative vocabulary
slight differences in grammar and in vocabulary. For this reason I confine myself to

a very few remarks, leaving a full discussion of the collected material for a future

opportunity.

     The plural of noun and verb is formed in the same manner as in Tsimshian.
Although the same words do not always follow the same rules, the classes are almost
the same. The remarks regarding adjective and verb (Fifth Report, pp. 80, 83)
hold good in Nisk-a' also.

     The system of numerals differs in so far as there is no separate class for ong

objects.

                                  PRONOUN.

                             Personal Pkonoun.

    ye, iiE'cEm.                                        ye, Id'sEvi.

    they (present), nc'dct.                             them (present), Id'odEt.

    ,, (absent), nc'detgyc.                                ,, (absent), Id'odEtgye.

                             Possessive Pronoun.

There is only one form for presence and absence, except that the latter has the

general suffix designating- absence -gya. The past is formed by the perfect prefix tl-,

the future by dEin-: The house that I had, tlhwVlla ; my future wife, dEmna'kysd.

    my father, nEgud'EduK.                              our father, UEgud' EdEni.

    thy father, nEgud,' sdEii.                          your father, iiEgud' EtSEm

    his father, iiEgua' eU.                             their father, nKgud' Edet.

                                  THE VERB.

                             Intransitive Verb.

The forms of the verb are also simpler than they are in Tsimshian.

    amI sick, sl'eph'ncE.                               we are sick, sipsl'epk'noKm.

    thou art sick, .n'epk'nen.                          ye are sick, sipsV epk' iwsevi.

    he is sick, sl'epk.                                 they are sick, sipsl'epk\

The perfect is formed by the temporal prefix tls-, the future by dsm-.

                                  Interrogative.

    am I sick ? sV epgunl-la.                           are we sick ? &ipsl' epgunuEma.

    art thou sick? sV epgEiiuna.                        are ye sick ? sipsV cpgunena^^.).
    is he sick ? si'Upigua.                             are they sick ? sipsi' epgua.

                                             Negative.

    I am not sick, niyi{di) si'epgue.        we are not sick, 7i/yi(di) sipsi'ipguEm.

    thou art not sick, nigi{di) sl'cpguen.   ye are not sick, niyi(di) sipsVepJi'SEm.
    he is not sick, nigi{di) si'epguet.      they are not sick, niyi(di) sipsl'e2)k'tet.

                                                Transitive Verb.

    The transitive verb shows also small differences from the Tsimshian verb. I give

-- --the forms of the verb to kill singular dzaTi\ plural yadzi for the imperfect, which

was not given in the description of the Tsimshian. The present tense is analogous

to that of the Tsimshian.

                              2. THE TS'ETS'A'UT.

    Uufortunately my informant Levi, the only one from whom I was able to obtain

grammatical information, was exceedingly difficult to manage, and I did not succeed
in making him understand that I desired to have Ts'Ets'a ut sentences and accurate

translations. For this reason my material is very unsatisfactory, and does not

permit an accurate description of the structure of the language. Besides this the
Tinneh phonetics are difficult, and Levi could not be induced to speak slowly, which

circumstance made the work still more difficult. I give on the following pages a
few remarks on the grammar, which will show what position the dialect takes among

other Tinneh dialects.

                                         THE NOUN.

     The noun has no gender. I did not find any indication of the existence of
separate forms for dual and plural, although these occur in Loucheus, Hare, and
Chippewayan. Cases do not exist.

    Compound nouns are of frequent occurrence. They are formed by means of
juxtaposition. Possession is often expressed by this means.

dirt,       hvutVefd' ( = sand-mud).

bear meat,  fii tsqa.                               hoof of goat, ahva' aba',

Before words beginning with h, es becomes iq. For instance             ,

                                   my house, ?q khu.

                                         THE VERB.

     The verb is exceedingly difficult to understand, and the meagre material which I
obtained from Levi is insufficient for a clear understanding of the subject. There
are a number of classes of verbs, as will be seen by the following examples :

            to sing (Petitot, 2nd class).

       I sing, isdjV.                               we sing, dau'dji.

       thou singest, tndji'.                        ye sing, daadjV
       he sings, mdji'                              they sing, ?

            to be ashamed {Petitot, 5th class).

       I am ashamed, vca'                           we are ashamed, da' una.

       thou art ashamed, viina'                  ye are ashamed, da'ana,

       he is ashamed, uHa'{ha).                     they are ashamed, ?

                                  to be afraid.

       amI afraid, nesdjH'.                      we are afraid, da'nidje.

       thou art afraid, ncndjc',                 ye are afraid, danndjB.
                                                 they are afraid, danedjc'.

                                  to be cold.

         I am cold, st-htW.                                     we two are cold, Hei'itl
                                                                we are cold, dd'sitlo.
         thou art cold, sinilu'.
         he is cold, sdtlo'.                                    ye are cold, Qaatlu'
                                                                they are cold, BimtlO'.
                                  to speak.
                                                                we speak, daQu'idd.
         I speak, QUEsdd'.
         thou speakest, Qundd'                                  ye speak, daaoadd'.
                                                                they speak, daQoadd'.
         he speaks, Quadd'

The future is formed by the vowel u.                            I shall skin it, dusted'.

               I skin it, distcee'.                             I am going to eat, uistsqe
                 I eat, istsqc'
               I tear it, ne'ntse.                              I shall tear it, nn'stse.

The interrogative is formed by the suffix -ya :

                                      art thou cold ? sindlD'ya,
                                     has he got a wife ? nWayd'ya.

The negative is formed by the suffix -dshe'

                             I am not sick, Ssaai'dEbe.

                                    I have no dog, istle'dsbe.

    There are numerous irregular verbs, particularly verbs of motion, but my notes on

this subject are very fragmentarj'

                                  to run.

      I am running, de'istVa.                               we are running, tldEjiU'ide.

      thou art running, dcintVa'                            ye are running, tldind'ode.
      he is running, datVa'.                                they are running, tldi'nadv.

                                                  to swim.  we are swimming, k'/i'eO.
                                                            ye are swimming, gyinau.
      I am swimming, r/yina'sbo'.

      thou art swimming, gyina'mhc.

      he is swimming, gymahc'                               they are  swimming,  <J  JiamJ'S.
                                                                                       '

                                                                                 Xgyi, nao.

I found only a few dual forms, but there                    no doubt that many more exist.

    amI sitting, xcKda.                                        run up, sing. sHtl'a.
                                                               run up, dual, sc'a.
    we two are sitting, sikyi'.                                run up, plural, sedc.
    man sitting, daidz^a'.

     The prefixed pronouns of the various tenses differ in the same manner as in other
dialects, but I have not been able, so far, to systematise the fragmentary material

myat dis{)osal.

     The preceding remarks show, however, that the dialect of the Ts'Ets'a'ut is more
closely affiliated to the Chippewayan and Sarcee than to the Chilcotin and Carrier

dialects.

     The following pages contain a comparative vocabulary of two dialects of the

Tsimshian, the Tsimshian proper and the Nisk'a', and of three Tinneh dialects : the
Tatltan (Tahltan), Ts'Ets'a'ut, and the TkulHiyogoa'ikc. The last of these is extinct.
The tribe inhabited the Upper Willopah River, in the State of Washington, and
is, therefore, the most northern of the great number of Tinneh tribes which are

scattered along the Pacific coast. The dialect is, for this reason, particularly inter-

esting. I am indebted to Major J. W. Powell, Director of the U.S. Bureau of

Ethnology, for permission to publish the vocabulary of this tribe which was collected
by George Gibbs in February 1856, and which is in the Library of the Bureau of
Ethnology in Washington, D.C. Gibbs calls the tribe erroneously O'whil-lapsh
(Quila'pc), this being the name of the Chinook tribe of the Lower Willopah Eiver.
Their name in the Chinook language is TkulHiyogoa'ikc, which agrees with Anderson's
name Kwal-whee-o-qua : their dialect seems to be almost identical vnth that of the

Klatskanai. I obtained a few words on my last journey from an old Chinook

--woman, which I add to Gibbs's list. He introduces his vocabulary with the following

remarks :

                                                                       G. GiBBS, Willopali, Fchrnary 185G.

                            From an Indian at S. G. Fords.

     ' Of the Willopah tribe formerly inhabiting that river and the liead waters of the

' Cliihalis, there are, I believe, but two families left ; from a man belonging to them

' I obtained the following :

     'He called his people O'whil-lapsh, the termination of which I should, however,
'judge to be of Chibalis origin. Their territory he called Whilap-a-hai-j-ou. The
* vocabulary was taken down in some haste, and, besides being incomplete, is not
'always altogether correct. Enough,however,isgiven to afford evidence of its character.'

     ' Mr. Anderson says : "The Kwal-whee-o-qua seem, from what I can learn, to have
'"occiTpied the Willopah River and its tributaries towards the head of the Chihalis,
' "and to have interlocked with the tribe who inhabited the country bordering on the
' " Elokamin River. Their habits of life seem to have been very similarto those of the

-- --' " Klat.skanai the chase and an interior life for part of the year resorting to the main

' " rivers at certain periods to secure a supplj' of salmon."'
     The Tatltan vocabulary is reprinted from Dr. G. M. Dawson's report on that

tribe ('Annual Report of the Geological Survey of Canado,' 1887, p. 191, B.ff.). The
words in parenthesis in the Ts'Ets'il'ut vocabulary were obtained from Timothj-, and
differed from those obtained from Levi. The latter said in explanation that
Timothy's father had come from Laq'uyi'jj (Naqkyina), and that for this reason
Timoth}'- spoke slightly differently. The two vocabularies show clearly that Tatltan
and Ts'Ets'a'ut are closely affiliated, but that certain regular changes of sounds occur,

/particularly ts in Tatltan becomes in Ts'Ets'a'ut, and i is often replaced by tq or tr.

Other changes are not so certain, and may be based on differences in perception and
method of recording. It would seem that the TkulHiyogoa'ikc resembles the
northern dialects more than those of the interior of British Columbia, but I am not

sufficiently familiar with the latter to satisfactorily judge on this point. In both the
Tatltan and TkulHiyogoa'ikc vocabularies I have retained the original spelling.

Section A.--MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE.
--Peesident of the Section Professor W. M, Hicks, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.

         THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12.

The President delivered the following Address :

In making a choice of subject for my address the difficulty is not one of finding

material but of making selection. The field covered by this Section is a wide one.

Investigation is active in every part of it, and is being rewarded with a continuous

stream of new discoveries and with the growth of that co-ordination and correla-

tion of facts which is the surest sign of real advancement in science. The ultimate

aim of pure science is to be able to explain the most complicated phenomena of

nature as flowing by the fewest possible laws from the simplest fundamental data.

A statement of a law is either a confession of ignorance or a mnemonic conveni-

ence. It is the latter if it is deducible by logical reasoning from other laws. It

is the former when it is only discovered as a fact to be a law. While, on the one

hand, the end of scientific investigation is the discovery of laws, on the other,

science will have reached its highest goal when it shall have reduced ultimate

laws to one or two, the necessity of which lies outside the sphere of our cognition.

-- --These ultimate laws in the domain of physical science at least will be the

dynamical laws of the relations of matter to number, space, and time. The ulti-

mate data will be number, matter, space, and time themselves. When these

relations shall be known, all physical phenomena will be a branch of pure mathema-

Wetics.  shall have done away with the necessity of the conception of potential
--energy, even if it may still be convenient to retain it ; and if it should be found

--that all phenomena are manifestations of motion of one single continuous medium
   the idea of force will be banished also, and the study of dynamics replaced by

the study of the equation of continuity.

    Before, however, this can be attained, we must have the working drawings of

the details of the mechanism we have to deal with. These details lie outside the
scope of our bodily senses ; we cannot see, or feel, or hear them, and this, not

because they are unseeable, but because our senses are too coarse-grained to trans-

mit impressions of them to our mind. The ordinary methods of investigation here

fail us ; we must proceed by a special method, and make a bridge of communica-
tion between the mechanism and our senses by means of hypotheses. By our

attained. It is the rejected theories which have been the necessary steps
towards formulating- others nearer the truth. It would be an extremely interest-
ing study to consider the history of these discarded theories ; to show the part
they have taken in the evolution of truer conceptions, and to trace the persistence

and modification of typical ideas from one stratum of theories to a later. I pro-

-- --pose, however, to ask your attention for a short time to one of these special

theories or rather to t\vo related theories on the constitution of matter and of

the ether. They are known as the vortex atom theory of matter, and the vortex
sponge theory of the ether. The former has been before the scientific world for
a quarter of a century, since its first suggestion by Lord Kelvin in 1867, the second
for about half that time. In what I have to say I wish to take the position not of
an advocate for or against, but simply as a prospector attempting to estimate what
return is likely to be obtained by laying down plant to develop an unknown dis-
trict. This is in fact the state of these two theories at present. Extremely little
progress has been made in their mathematical development, and until this has been
done more completely we cannot test them as to their powers of adequately ex-

plaining physical phenomena.
     The theory of the rigid atom has been a very fruitful one, especially in ex-

plaining the properties of matter in the gaseous state ; but it gives no explanation

of the apparent forces which hold atoms together, and in many other respects it
requires supplementing. The elastic solid ether explained much, but there are

--difficulties connected with it especially in connection with reflection and refraction
--which decide against it. The mathematical rotational ether of MacCullagh is

admirably adapted to meet these difficulties, but he could give no physical concep-
tion of its mechanism. Maxwell and Faraday proposed a special ether for
electrical and magnetic actions. Maxwell's identification of the latter with the

luminiferous ether, his deduction of the velocity of propagation of light and of

indices of refraction in terms of known electrical and magnetic constants, will
form one of the landmarks in the history of science. This ether requires the same
mathematical treatment as that of MacCullagh. Lord Kelvin's gyrostatic model
of an ether is also of the MacCullagh type. Lastly, we have Lord Kelvin's labile
ether, which again avoids the objections to the elastic solid ether. In MacCullagh's
type of ether the energy of the medium when disturbed depends only on the twists
produced in it. This ether has recently been mathematically discussed by Dr.
Larmor, who has shown that it is adequate to explain all the various phenomena
of light, electricity, and magnetism. To this I hope to return later. Meanwhile,
it may be borne in mind that the vortex sponge ether belongs to MacCullagh's

type.

     Already before a formal theory of a fluid ether had been attempted, Lord
Kelvin ^ had proposed his theory of vortex atoms. The permanence of a vortex

iilament with its infinite flexibility, its fundamental simplicity with its potential
capacity for complexity, struck the scientific imagination as the thing which was

wanted. Unfortunatelj^ the mathematical difficulties connected with the discus-

sion of these motions, especially the reactions of one on another, have retarded the

full development of the theory. Two objections in chief have been raised against

it, viz. the difficulty of accounting for the densities of various kinds of matter, and

the fact that in a vortex ring the velocity of translation decreases as the energy
increases. There are two ways of dealing with a difficulty occurring in a general

--theory one is to give up the theory, the other is to try to see if it can be modi-

fied to get over the difficulty. Such difficulties are to be welcomed as means of
help in arriving at greater exactness in details. It is a mistake to submit too
readily to crucial experiments. The very valid crucial objection of Stokes to
MacCullagh's ether is a case in point. It drew away attention from a theory

which, in the light of later developments, gives great hope of leading us to correct

ideas. As Larmor has pointed out, this objection vanishes when we have intrinsic

Arotations in the ether itself.  special danger to guard against is the importation

into one theory of ideas which have grown out of one essentially diS"erent. This

remark Las reference to the apparent difficulty of decrease of velocity with in-

creased energy.

     Maxwell was, I believe, the first to point out the difficulty of explaining the

masses of the elements on the vortex a^^m hypothesis. To me it has always ap-

peared one of the greatest stumhling-bloclis to the acceptance of the theory. AYe

have always been accustomed to regard the ether as of extreme tenuity, as of a

density extremely though not infinitely smaller than that of gross matter, and we

carry in our minds that Lord Kelvin has given an inferior limit of about lO-*'*.

There are two directions in which to seek a solution. Tlie first is to cut the knot

by supposing that the atoms of gross matter are composed of filaments whose
rotating cores are of much greater density than the ether itself. The second is to
remember that Lord Kelvins number was obtained on the supposition of elastic

solid ether, and does not necessarily apply to the vortex sponge. Unfortunately,

however, for the first explanation, the mathematical discussion ' shows that a ring

cannot be stable unless tlie density of the fluid outside the core is equal to, or

greater than, that inside. This instability also cannot be cured by supposing an

additional circulation added outside the core. Unless, therefore, some modification
of the theory can be made to secure stability, this idea of dense fluid cores must be

given up.

   We seem, therefore, forced back to the conclusion that the density of the ether

must be comparable with that of ordinary matter. The effective mass of any atom

is not composed of that of its core alone, but also of that portion of the surround-
ing ether which is carried along with it as it moves through the medium. Thus a

rigid sphere moving in a liquid behaves as if its mass were increased by half that

of the displaced liquid. In the case of a vortex filament the ratio of effective to

actual mass may be much larger. In this explanation the density of the matter

composing an atom is the same for all, whilst their masses depend on their volumes

Nowand configurations combined.  the configuration alters with the energy, and

this would make the mass depend to some extent at least on the temperature.

However repugnant this may be to current ideas, we are not entitled to deny its

possibility, although such an effect must be small or it would have been detected.

Such a variation, if it exists, is not to be looked for by means of the ordinary gravi-

tation balance, but by the inertia or ballistic balance. The mass of the core itself

--remains, of course, constant, but the effective mass that which we can measure

--by the mechanical effects whicli the moving vortex produces is a much more

complicated matter, and requires much fuller consideration than has been given

to it.

     The conditions of stability allow us to assume vacnous cores or cores of less
density than the rest of the medium. If we do this then the deusity of the ether

itself may be greater than that of gross matter. Until, however, we meet with

phenomena whose explanation requires this assumption, it would seem preferable

to take the density everywhere the same. In this case the density of the ether
must be rather less than the apparent density of the lightest of any of the elements,
taking the apparent density to mean the effective mass of a vortex atom per its

volume. This will jjrobably be commensurable with the density of the matter in

--its most compressed state, and will lie between '5 and 1 comparable, that is to

say, with the density of water. Larmor,- from a special form of hypothesis for a
magnetic field in the rotationally elastic ether, is led to assign a density of the
same order of magnitude. If the density be given it is easy to calculate the
intrinsic energy per c.c. in the medium. The velocity of propagation of light in a

vortex sponge ether, as deduced by Lord Kelvin,^ is '47 times the mean square

velocity of tlie intrinsic motion of the medium. Tliis gives for the mean square
velocitv 6-3 >^ 10"* cm. per second. If we follow Lord Kelvin and use for com-
parison the energy of radiation per c.c. near the sun, or say TS erg per c.c, the
resulting density will be lO"-'. The energy per c.c. in a magnetic field of
15,000 c.g.s. units is about 1 joule. If we take this for comparison we get a
density of 10-^^. But the intrinsic energy of the fluid must be extremely great

--compared with the energy it has to transmit. If it were a million times greater

the density would still only amount to 10"® comparable with the density of the
residual gas in our highest vacua. To account for the density of gross matter on
the supposition that it is built up out of the same material as the ether leads to a
density between -5 and 1. This gives the enormous energy of 10^* joules per c.c. In

other words, the energy contained in one cubic centimetre of the ether is sufficient
to raise a kilometre cube of lead 1 metre high against its weight. Thus the diiR-

culty in explaining the mass of ordinary matter seems to reduce itself to a difficulty

in believing that the ether possesses such an enormous store of energy. It may be
that there are special reasons against such a large density. Larmor refers to the

large forcives which would be called into play by hydrodynamical motions. Per-

haps an answer to this may be found in the remark that where all the matter is of

the same density the motions are kineuiatically deducible from the configuration
at the instant, and are independent of the density. It is only where other causes
act, such, e.g., as indirectly depend on the mean pressure of the fluid or where

vacuous spaces occur, that the actual value of the density may modify the measur-

able forcives.

Ever since Professor J. J. Thomson proved that a vortex atom theory of matter

is competent to serve as a basis of a kinetic theory of gases, it has been urged by

various persons as a fatal objection that the translation velocity of the atoms falls

off as the temperature rises. I must confess this objection has never appealed to

Whyme.  should not the velocity fall off'? The velocity of gaseous molecules has

never been directly observed, nor has it been experimentally proved that it in-

Wecreases with rise of temperature.  have no right to import ideas based on the

kinetic theory of hard discrete atoms into the totally distinct theory of mobile

atoms in continuity with the madium surrounding them. Doubtless the molecules

of a gas effuse through a small orifice more quickly as the temperature rises, but it

is natural to suppose that a. vortex ring would do the same as its energy increases.

To make the objection valid, it is necessary to show that a vortex ring passing

through a small tube, comparable with its own diameter, wotdd pass through more

slowly the greater its energy. It is not, however, necessarily the case that in every

vortex aggregate the velocity decreases as the energy increases. The mathematical

treatment of thin vortex filaments is comparatively easy, and little attention has

been paid to other cases. Let us attempt to trace the life history as to translation

Wevelocity and energy of a vortex ring.  start with the energj^ large ; the ring

now has a very large aperture, and has a very thin filament. As the energy de-

creases the aperture becomes smaller, the filament thicker, and the velocity of

Wetranslation greater.  can trace quantitatively the whole of this part of its

history until the thickness of the ring has increased to about four times the diameter

of the aperture, or perhaps a little further. Then the mathematical treatment em-
ployed fails us or becomes very laborious to apply. Till eighteen months ago, this
was the only portion of its history we could trace. Then Professor M. J. M. Hill

published his beautiful discovery of the existence of a spherical vortex. This con-

sists of a spherical mass of fluid in vortical motion and moving bodily through the

surrounding fluid, precisely as if it were a rigid sphere. This enables us to catch a

momentary glimpse as it were of our vortex ring some little time after it has passed
out of our ken. The aperture has gone on contracting, the ring thickening, and
altering the shape of its cross section in a manner whose exact details have not yet
been calculated. At last we just catch sight of it again as the aperture closes up.

We find the ring has changed into a spherical ball, with still further diminished

energy and increased velocity. AVe then lose sight of it again, but it now lengthens

out, and towards tlie end of its course approximates to the form of a rod moving

parallel to its length through the fluid with energy and velocity which again can

be approximately determined. In this part of its life the velocity of translation

decreases with decrease of energy. I believe it will be found, when the theory is

completely worked out, that the spherical atom is the stage where this reversal of

property takes place.

     Even in the ring state, however, the change of velocity with energy is very

small ; much smaller, I think, than is generally recognised. When the energy

is increased to twenty times that of the spherical vortex, the velocity is only

diminished to two-thirds its previous value. If at ordinary temperatures, say 27° C,

the vortex was in the spherical shape, then at 3,000° G. its velocity of translation

would only have been reduced to four-lifths its value at the lower temperature,

whilst the aperture of the ring would have a radius about 1'4 time that of the

sphere. At 2,000° C. the velocity would not differ by much more than one-

twentieth from its original value. In fact, near the spherical state the alteration

in velocity of translation is very slow. It is therefore possible, that if the atoms

of matter be vortex aggregates, the state in which we can experimentally test our

theory is just that in which the mathematical discussion fails us. Other modifica-

tions tend to diminish this change of velocity. I will refer here to three only. The

Wefirst is that of hollow vortices.  must not, however, postulate vacuous atoms

without any rotational core at all ; for in this case we should probably lose the
essential property of permanence. The question has not been fully investigated,

but there can be little doubt but that by diminishing the energy of a completely

Wehollow vortex we can cause it to disappear.  can certainly create one in a per-

fect fluid. Secondly, J. J. Thomson has shown that if a molecule be composed of

linked filaments, the energy increases as the components move further apart. In

such a case an extra supply of energy goes to expanding the molecule, and less, if

i,ny, to increasing the aperture. Lastly, a modification of the atomic motion to

which I shall refer later, and which seems called for to explain the magnetic rota-

tion of the plane of polarisation of light, will also tend to lessen the change of size,

and therefore change of velocity with change of energy, even if it does not reverse

the property.

If we pass on to consider how a vortex atom theory lends itself to the explana-

tion of physical and chemical properties of matter independently of what may be

called ether relations, we find that we owe almost all our knowledge on this point

to the work of Professor J. J. Thomson, ^ which obtained the Adams' Prize in

1882. This, however, is confined to the treatment of thin vortex rings, still leaving

a wide field for future investigation in connection with thick rings and with vortex

aggregates which produce no cyclosis in the surrounding medium. His work is an

extremely suggestive one. He shows that such a theory is capable not only of

explaining the gaseous laws of a so-called perfect gas, but possibly also the slight

deviations therefrom. Quite as striking is his explanation of chemical combina-
-- Ation an explanation which flows quite naturally from the theoiy.
                                                                      vortex fila-

ment can be linked on itself: two or more can be linked together, like helices

drawn on an anchor rins: ; or, lastly, several can be arranged together like parallel

rings successively threading one another. In the latter case, for such an arrange-

ment to be permanent, the strengths of each ring must be the same, and further,

not more than six can thus be combined together. The linked vortices will be in

permanent combination on account of their liukedness ; the other arrangement may

be permanent if subject to no external actions. If, however, they are disturbed by

the presence of other vortices they may break up. When atoms are thus combined

to form a compound, a certain number of molecules will always be dissociated
the compound will be permanent when the ratio of the average paired time to the

unpaired time of any atom is large. Thomson considers every filament to be of the
same strength. Then an atom consisting of two links will behave like a ring of
twice the strength, one of three links, of three times the strength, and so on. On

this theory chemical compounds are to be regarded as systems of rings, not linked

Harrange two of together to form one system. This system has the same strength as

O, they can therefore revolve in permanent connection, and we get the water mole-

Hcule. Or we may take two of the O atoms and one of the double molecule, and

they can form a triple system of three rings threading one another in permanent

connection, and we get the molecule HoOj. This short example will be sufficient
to indicate how the theory gives a complete accoimt of valency.

     The energy of rings thus combined is less than when free ; consequently they

are stable, and the act of combination sets free energy. Further, Thomson points

out that for two rings to combine their sizes must be about the same when they

come into proximity ; consequently combination can only occur between two limits

of temperature corresponding to the energies within which the radii of both kinds

of rings are near an equality.

   We can easily extend Thomson's reasoning to explain the combination of two

elements by the presence of a third neutral substance. Call the two elements

A Awhich are to combine and B, and the neutral substance C. The radii of and

±J are to be supposed too unequal to allow them to come close enough together to

combine. If now at the given temperature the C atom has a radius intermediate

AC picks up one of A, and after a short time drops it ; will leave C with its

radius brought up (say) to closer equality with it. The same thing happens with

the B atoms, and they leave C with their radii brought down to closer equality
A Bwith it. The result is that and are brought into closer equality with one
Canother, and if this is of sufficient amount, they can combine and do so, while

remains as before and apparently inert.

Thomson's theory of chemical combination applies only to thin rings. Some-

thing analogous may hold also for thick rings, but it is clearly inapplicable to

Wevortex aggregates similar to that of Hill's.  are not confined, however, to this

particular kind of association of vortex atoms in a molecule. For instance, I have

recently found' that one of Hill's vortices can swallow up another and retain it

inside in relative equilibrium. The matter requires fuller discussion, but it seems

to open up another mode of chemical combination.

   A most important matter which has not yet been discussed at all is the relation

between the mean energy of the vortex cores, and the energy of the medium itself

when the atoms are close enough to afl'ect each other's motions (as in a gas). The

fundamental ideas are quite difi'erent from those underlying the well-known

kinetic theory of gases of hard atoms. Nevertheless, many of the results must b»-

very similar, based as both are on dynamical ideas. Whether it will avoid certain

difficulties of the latter, especially those connected with the ratio of the specifie

heats, remains to be seen. The first desideratum is the determination of the

equilibrium of energy between vortices and medium, and before this is done it is

useless to speculate further in this region.

   A vortex atom theory of matter carries with it the necessity of a fluid ether.

If such a fluid is to transmit transversal radiations, some kind of quasi-elasticity

must be produced in it. This can be done by supposing it to possess energetic
rotational motions whose mean velocity is zero, within a volume whose linear

dimension is small compared with the wave length of light, but whose velocity of

mean square is considerable. That an ether thus constituted is capable of trans-

mitting transverse vibrations I showed before this Section at the Aberdeen meeting

of the Association,^ by considering a medium composed of closely packed discrete

small vortex rings. Lord Kelvin' at the Mancliester lueetino- discussed the

question uuicli more thorouwlily and satisfactorily, and deduced that the velocity

of propagation was \/-/-j times tbe velocity of mean square of the turbulent

Wemotion.  can make little further progress until we know something of the

arrangement of the small motions which confer the quasi-rigidity. This may be

completely irregular and unsteady, or arranged in some definite order of steady

motions. I am inclined to the view that the latter is nearer the truth. In this

ease we should expect a regular structure of small cells iu which the motions are

all similar. 15y the word cell I do not mean a small vessel bounded by walls, but a

portion of the iluid in which the motion is a complete system in itself. ISuch a

theory might be called a cell theory of the elher. The simplest type perhaps is to

suppose the medium spaced into rectangular boxes, in each of whicb the motion

may be specified as follows. Holding the box with one set of faces horizontal

the fluid streams up in the centre of the box, then turns round, flows down tbe

sides and up the centre again. In fact it behaves like a Hill's vortex squeezed

from a spherical into a box form. Each box has thus rotational circulation

complete in itself. The six adjoining compartments have their motion the same in

kind but in the reverse direction, and so on. In this way we get continuous and

energetic small motions throughout the medium, and the state is a stable one. If

there is a shear, so that each cell becomes slightly rhomboidal, tbe rotational

motions inside tend to prevent it, and thus propagate the disturbance, but the cells
produce no efl'ect on the general irrotational motion of the fluid, at least when the-

irrotatlonal velocities are small compared with fhose of the propagation of light.

In this case the rate at which the cells adjust themselves to an equilibrium position
is far quicker than the rate at which this equilibrium distribution is disturbed by
the gross motions. The linear dimensions of the cells must be small compared
with the wave lengths of light. They must probably be small also compared with
the atoms of gross matter, which are themselves small compared with the same

standard.

    "We may regard each cell as a dynamical system by itself, into which we pour
or take away energy. This added energy will depend only on the shape into
which the box is deformed. AVe may then, for our convenience in considering the
gross motions of the medium as a whole, i.e. our secondary medium, regard these

as interlocked systems, neglect the direct consideration of the motions inside them,

but regard the energy which they absorb as a potential function for the general

motion. This potential function will contain terms of two kinds, one involving the

shear of the cells, and this shear will be the same as that of the rotational deforma-

tion in the secondary medium. The second will depend on alterations iu tbe ratios

of the edges of the cells.'- The former will give rise to waves of transversal displace-
ments. The second cannot be transmitted as waves, but may produce local ett'ects.

If a continuous solid be placed in such a medium, the cells will rearrange
themselves so as to keep the continuity of their motions. The cells will become
distorted (but without resultant shear), and a static stress will be set up. AVe have
then to deal with the primary stuft' itself, whose rotation gives a structure to the

ether, and the structural ether itself. The former we may call the primary medium.

The ether which can transmit transversal disturbances, and which is built up out of
the first, we may call the secondary medium. "Whether an atom of matter is to
be considered as a vortical mass of the primary or of the secondary medium

is a matter to be left open in the present state of the theory.

action of a fluid ether in which electrical lines of force were vortex filaments

electrostatic actions, toth quantitatively and qualitatively, and a more speculative
one as to currents and magnetism. I could only succeed in proving at that time

that if the filaments were distributed according lo the same laws as electric lines

of force, the distribution would be one of equilibrium. Larmor ^ has recently

proved that this is also the necessary distribution for any type of a rotationally

elastic ether, and consequently also for this particular case. Currents along a

wire were supposed to consist of the ends of filaments running along it, with dis-

appearance of the hollow companions, the filaments producing at the same time a
Acirculation round the wire.
                              magnetic field was thus to be regarded as a flow

of the ether, but probably with the necessary accompaniment of rotational elements

in it.

This latter, however, was clearly wrong, because each kind of filament would

produce a circulation in opposite directions. The correct deduction would have

been to lay stress on the fact that the field is due to the motion through the

stationary ether of the vortex filaments, the field being perpendicular to the fila-

ment and to its direction of motion. This motion would doubtless produce

stresses in the cell-ether due to deformations of the cells, and be the proximate

cause of the mechanical forces in the field. In any case, it is not difficult to

show that a magnetic field cantiot be due to an irrotational flow of the ether alone.'^
Such electrostatic and magnetic fields produce states of motion in the medium, but

no bodily flow in it ; consequently we ought not to expect an effect to be produced

on the velocity of transmission of light through it.

     The fundamental postulate underlying this explanation of electric action is
that when two diflerent kinds of m.atter are brought into contact a distribution of

vortex Hlaments in the neighbourhood takes place, so that a larger number stretch

--from_ one to the other than in the opposite direction the distinction between

positive and negative ends being that already indicated. To see how such a
distribution may be caused, let us consider each vorte.x atom to be composed of a

vortical mass of our secondary medium or cell-structure ether. The atom is much
larger than a cell, and contains practically an infinite number of them. It is a

dynamical system of these cells with equilibrium of energy throughout its volume.
The second atom is a dynamical system with a diflerent equilibrium of energy.
AVhere they come into contact there will be a certain surface rearrangement,
which will show itself as a surface distribution of energy in a similar manner to
that which exists between a molar collection of one kind of molecules in contact

with one of another, and which shows itself in the phenomenon which we call

surface tension. In the present case the eflect may take place at the interface
of two atomic systems in actual contact, or be a difl-'erence eflect between the two

interfaces of the ether and each atom when the latter are sufficiently close. The

surface effect we are now considering shows itself as contact electricity.

Such a distribution of small vortex filaments, stretching from one atom to

Weanother, will tend to hold them together.       therefore get an additional cause

for aggregation of atoms. This does not exclude the others already referred to.

--They may all act concurrently, some producing one effect, some another one

combining, perhaps, unlmown primitive atoms into elements, one elements into

chemical compounds, and another producing the cohesion of matter into masses.

     On this theory the difference between a conductor and a dielectric is that in
a dielectric the ends of the filaments cannot pass from atom to atom, possibly

- To prove this, consider a straight conductor moving par.allel to itself and per-

pendicular to a uniform magnetic field. There exists a permanent potential difference
between its ends. If, however, the field cons'sts of a flow of ether, the effect is the
same as if the conductor is at rest, and the direction of the magnetic field shifted
through an angle. But this is the case of a conductor at rest in a field, and there

is therefore no potential difference between the ends. Hence a magnetic field must

Aconsist of some structure across which the conductor cuts.  field may possiblj'

demand a flow of the ether, but, if so, it must carry in it some structure definitely

oriented at each point to the direction of flow.

because the latter never come into actual contact. In a conductor, however, we
are to suppose that the atomic elements cau do so. When a current is flowing, a

filament and its equivalent hollow stretch between two neighbouring atoms, tbey

are pulled into contact, or their motions bring them into contact, the hollow dis-
appears, and the rotational filament joins its two ends and sails away as a small

neutral vortex ring into the surrounding medium, or returns to its function as an ether

cell. The atoms being free are now pulled back to perform a similar operation for other

filaments. The result is that the atoms are set into violent vibrations, causing the
heating of the conductor. When, howevei', the metal is at absolute zero of tem-
perature, there is no motion, the atoms are already in contact, and there is no resist-

ance, as the observation of Dewar and Fleming tends to show. Further, as the
resistance depends on the communication of motion from molecule to molecule, we

should expect the electrical conductivity of a substance to march with its thermal

conductivity. Again, on this theory the resistance clearly increases with increase of

distance between atoms i.e., with increase of temperature. On the contrary, in
electrolytic conduction the same junction of filament ends is brought about, not by

oscillations of molecule to molecule, but by disruption of the molecule and passage

of atom to atom. In this case conduction is easier the more easily a molecule is split
up, and thus resistance decreases with increase of temperature. To explain the laws

of electrolysis it is only necessary to assume that the strengths of all filaments are the

Asame.  similar hypothesis, as we have seen, lies at the basis of J. J. Thomson's

explanation of chemical combination, although it is not necessarily the case that

we are dealing with the same kind of filaments. It is evident that the theory

easily lends itself to his views as to the mechanism of the electric discharge

through gases. The modus operandi of the production of the mechanical forcive

on a conductor carrying a current iu a magnetic field and of electrodynamic

induction is not clear. Probably the full explanation is to be found in the

stresses produced in the ether owing to the deformation of the cells by the passage

of the filaments through them. The fluid moves according to the equation of con-

tinuity without slip, and subject to the surface conditions at the conductors. This

motion, however, distorts the cells, and stresses are called into play. Any theory

which can explain the mechanical forcives and also Ohm's law, must, on the

principles of the conservation of energy, also explain the induction of currents.

The magnetic rotation of the plane of polarisation of light does not depend on

the structure of the ether, or on the magnetic field itself, but is a result of the

atomic configuration of the matter in the field modified by the magnetism. It is

generally recognised as caused by something in the field rotating round the direc-

Nowtion of the magnetic lines of force.  the vortex atom, as usually pictured, is

incapable of exhibiting this property. It is, however, an interesting fact, and one

which I hope to demonstrate to this Section during the meeting, that a vortex ring

--can have two simultaneous and independent cyclic motions one the ordinary one,

and another which is capable of producing just the action on light which shows

itself as a rotation of the plane of polarisation. The motion is rather a compli-

cated one to describe without a diagram, but an idea of its nature may be obtained

by considering the case of a straight cylindrical vortex. The ordinary straight

vortex consists, as every one knows, of a cylinder of fluid revolving like a solid, and

surrounded by a fluid in irrotational motion. In the core the velocity increases

from zero at the axis to a maximum at its surface. Thence it continuously

decreases in the outer fluid as the distance increases. Everywhere the motion is

in a plane perpendicular to the axis. Let us now consider a quite diflerent kind

of vortical motion. Suppose the fluid is flowing along the core like a viscous fluid

through a pipe ; the velocity is zero at the surface and a maximum at the axis.

Everywhere it is parallel to the axis, the vortex lines are circles in planes perpen-

dicvdar to the axis, and concentric with it. Since the velocity at the surface of the

Nowcore is zero, the surrounding fluid is also at rest.  superpose this motion on

the previous one, and it will be found to be steady. If a short length of this

vortex be supposed cut oft', bent into the shape of a circle and the ends joined, we

shall have a very rough idea of the compound vortex ring of which I speak. I
--

say a very rough idea, because the actual state of motion in a ring vortex or a

Hill's vortex is not quite so simple as the analogy might lead one to think.

    Now a compound vortex atom of this kind is just what we want to produce

rotation of the plane of polarisation of light. The light passing through such a

vortex has the direction of vibration twisted in the wave front. In ordinary

matter no such rotation is produced, because the various atoms are inditferently

directed, and they neutralise each other's eii'ects. Let, however, a magnetic field be

produced, and they will range themselves so that, on the average, the primary '

circulations through the apertures will point in the direction of the field. Conse-

quently the average direction of the secondary spin will be in planes perpendicular

to this, and will rotate the plane of polarisation of any light whose wave front

passes them. The rotation is produced onlj- on the light which is transmitted thmigh

the vortex. The rotation observed is a resultant etl'ect. In fact it is clear that in

the case of refraction the optical media belong to the type in which every portion

transmits the light, and not to the type in which refraction is produced by opaque

bodies embedded in the ether. Tlie atoms are only opaque if they contain vacuous

cores. The question of the grip of the particles on the ether does not enter, but

-- --dilference of quality showing itself in refraction and dispersion is due to difference

in average rotational quasi-elasticity produced by the atomic circulations, and

possibly absorption is due to precessional and nutational motion set up by the

secondary spins. These, however, are perhaps rather vague speculations.

Instead of attempting to invent ethers, to deduce their properties from tbeir

specifications, and then seeing whether tbey fit in with experience, we maj' begin

half way. "\Ve may assume difierent forms for the function giving the energy of

the medium when disturbed, apply general dynamical methods, and distinguish,

between tho.se which are capable of explaining the phenomena we are investigating

and those which are not. Invention is then called upon to devise a medium for

which the desired energy-function is appropriate. This was the method applied by

MacCullagh to the luminiferous ether. He obtained an algebraical form of the

energy function which completely satisfied the conditions for a luminiferous ether;

its essentiiil property being that the energy depended only on the rotational dis-

placements of its small parts. He was unable, however, to picture a stable material

Wemedium which would possess this property.  recognise now that such a

medium is possible if the rotational rigidity is produced by intrinsic motions in the

small parts of the medium of a gyrostatic nature. In a most masterly manner

Larmor- has recently investigated by general dynamical methods the possibility of

explaining electric and magnetic phenomena by means of the same energy function.

Electric lines of force are rotational filaments in the ether,^ similar in fact to those

I suggested at Bath, whilst a magnetic field consists of a fiow of the ether. The

same difficulty in accounting for electro-dynamic induction arises, but the general

form of the equations for the electro-dynamic and magnetic fields are the same as

those generally received.

     Towards the end of this ])aper he is led to postulate a theory of electrons whose

convection through the ether constitutes an electric current. Two rotating round

each other are supposed to produce the same efiect as a vortex ring. The mass of

ordinary matter is attributed to the electric inertia of these electrons. The electrori

itself is a centre or nucleus of rotational strain. If I express a doubt as to the

possibility of the existence of these nuclei as specified, I do so with great diffidence.*

     ' ' Primary ' refers to the motion as usually understood ; ' secondary,' to the super-
posed, as explained above.

     ^ The necessity that the filaments shall be in pairs docs not seem to lie recognised.
This is, however, essential. Moreover, if the complementary circulations of the filaments
between (say) a plate condenser be placed otlierwhere than in the same region, the
filaments between the plates must rotate as a whole ; that is, an electric tield would
always be combined with a magnetic one.
     * It would appear that the same results would flow if two particles oppositely

rotate round each other.

Whether they can or cannot exist, however, the general results of the investigation

are not affected.

     Since this paper was published Larmor has read a second one on the same

subject before the Royal Society, developing further his theory of the electron.

The publication of this will be awaited with interest. It is impossible in an

address such as this to go seriatim into the numerous points which he takes up and

illuminates, because the mathematical treatment of the general question does not

lend itself easily to oral exposition even to an audience composed of professed

mathematicians. There is no doubt but that this paper has put the theory of a

-- --rotationally elastic ether and with it that of a fluid vortex ether on a sounder

basis, and will lead to its discussion and elucidation by a wider circle of investi-

gators.

One further class of physical phenomena yet remains, viz., those of gravitation.

The ether must be capable of transmitting gravitational forces as well as electric

find optical efiects. Does the rotational ether give any promise of doing this ? No

satisfactory explanation of gravitation on any theory has yet been ofiered. Perhaps

the least unsatisfactorj- is that depending on the vortex atom theory of matter,

which attributes it to pulsations of hollow vortex atoms. But this necessitates
that they should all pulsate with the same period and in the same phase. It is
very difficult to conceive how this can happen, unless, as Larmor suggests, all
matter is built up of constant elements like his electrons, whose periods are neces-

sarily all alike. It is possible tliat the vortex cell theory of the ether, of which I

have alreadj^ spoken, may suffice to explain gravitation also. The cells, besides
their rotational rigidity, have, in addition, as we saw, a peculiar elasticity of form.
To get an idea of how this theory may account for weight, let us suppose the
simplest case where all the cells are exactly alike, and the medium is in equilibrium.

Now suppose one of the cells begins to grow. It forces the medium away on all

sides : the cells will be distorted in some definite way, and a strain set up. Further,

this strain will be transmitted from the centre, so that the total amount across any

concentric sphere will be the same. Stresses will therefore be set up in the whole
medium. If a second cell begins to grow at another place it will produce also a

state of strain, the total strain depending on the presence of both. The stresses
called into play in the medium will produce a stress between the bodies, but it
is questicmable whether it would be inversely as the square of the distance.
Whether it would be an attraction or repulsion can only be determined b}- mathe-
matical investigation. The problem is quite determinate, though probably a very
difficult one, and would be of mathematical interest quite apart from its physical
importance. Since apparently the phenomena of gravitation have no direct "inter-
action with those of light and electricity, whilst the mind rejects the possibility of
two different media occupying the same space, we seem driven to look for it in an
independent structure of the same medium. Such a structure is already to our

hands, with its effects waiting to be determined. It may well be that it may
prove to be the cause we are seeking.

The rapid survey I have attempted to make is no doubt a medley of suppositions

and inferences combined with some sound deductions. This is the'necessary conse-

quence of a prospecting survey in a region whose surface has been merely scratched
Myby pioneers.
                object has been to show that this theory of an ether, based on a

primitive perfect fluid, is one which shows very promising signs of being able to

explain the various physical phenomena of our material universe. Probably, nay

·certainly, the explanations suggested are not all the true ones. Some will have to

Webe given up, others modified with further knowledge.  cannot proceed to

particularise in our secondary hypotheses until we know more about the properties
of such media as we have been considering. Every special problem solved in

vortex motion puts us in a position to form clearer ideas of what can and what

cannot happen. The whole question of vortex aggregates and their interactions is

practically untouched, and a rich field is open for mathematical investigation in
this portion only of the subject. In all cases, whether a fluid ether is an actual

fact or not, the results obtained will be of special interest as types of fluid motion.

It LS at present a subject in which the mathematicians must lead the attack. I

myshall have attained my object in choosing this subject for  address, if by it I

can induce some of our younger mathematicians to take it up, and work out its

details.

   --The following Papers and Report were read :

                 1. On the Reichsanstalt, CharlottenMirf/, Berlin.
                          By Sir Douglas Galton, K.C.B.

     The original idea of this establishment emanated from von Helmholtz and
Werner von Siemens. The site at Charlottenburg, about 11 acres, was given by
Dr. Werner von Siemens, and he contributed 250,000 marks (12,000/.) in aid of
the building. Thereupon the German Government undertook the construction of
the building and its endowment.

     The design of the buildings and the working arrangements were planned by
von Helmholtz, who was appointed its first director. One portion of the estabhsh-
ment is complete and in operation. The buildings for the other portion are still

in course of erection.

     The scientific work of the second portion is meanwhile being partially carried
on in the Royal Technical High School, situated at Charlottenburg.

     As the establishment is thus still far from complete, the cost of the building

and equipment, and of the annual expenditure for maintenance, cannot be given.

     The object of the establishment may be defined to be ' the development of

pure scientific research, and the promotion of new applications of science for

industrial jmrposesJ

     The establishment consists of two divisions. The first is charged with pure
research, and is at the present time engaged in various thermal, optical, and

electrical and other physical investigations.

     The reports on many branches of work which have been done in this estab-

lishment are appended to the paper.
     The second branch is employed in delicate operations of standardising and

testing to assist the wants of outside research students, and to facilitate applica-
tions of science to industries. As, for instance, comparison with standards of the
dilatation of metals, of electrical resistances, of electric and other forms of light,
of lenses, of pressure g auges, of recording instruments, thermometers, pyrometers,
and tuning-forks, experiments on the qualities of glass, examination of oil-testing

apparatus, viscosity of glycerine, &c.

     The plans exhibited give a general idea of the size of the establishment,
which stands in its own grounds, of which the space not covered by buildings is

laid out in gardens.

     The principal building is occupied by the first division ; it faces the north-
west, and stands at some distance back from the road. This building is about
100 feet long and 85 feet deep. It has three floors of laboratories, and a basement
which stands on a mass of cement concrete 2 metres thick, so as to protect
the apparatus from vibration ; but notwithstanding every precaution, the

passing of heavy waggons in the road occasions some movement. An electric

tramway is talked of. If this be constructed, serious injury will result to the

institution.

      In this building there are thirty separate apartments devoted to laboratories,
in addition to the several official rooms required for the director and staff", and
there is also in the building a large and excellent library of works on pure and

applied science.

     To the south of this, and parallel to it, is the building for the second division.
This building is nearly 200 feet long, and there are tM'o wings, each of which
                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                      607

projects to the south to a distance xff -nearly 95 feet. This building also is three

storeys in height.

In the second division there are about forty-one or forty-two apartments

devoted to laboratories, in addition to a considerable number of rooms required
for the director, the clerks, and Ihe staff, and for a small library.

     Towards the front on the eastern side, but nearer the road, is the director's
house. On the western side is a house which affords apartments for two of the
assistants, and a meeting room for the Board of Management and subsidiary clerks'

offices. Behind the latter building, on the west side, are placed the engine house,
and rooms for dynamos and storage batteries, as well as laboratories for operations
in which the use of cold air is required. These are in course of construction.

These buildings are equally convenient for the supply of power to both

divisions.

    Two important questions for a department of pure research are: first, the

management and the arrangements for regulating the subjects of research secondly,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the methods of taking stock of the work done in the establishment.

     In the Reichsanstalt the President is supreme over the staff. The successor to

V. Helmholtz is Dr. Kohlrausch. He takes charge of the first division, viz., that of

pure research.

The Director, Professor Ilagen, under him, takes charge of the second division.

Each main division is subdivided into separate departments for each branch of

research                                           these are in charge  of permanent  professors.  Each of these has under
                                                ;

him the necessary assistants selected for limited periods, and for previous good

work in one or other of the universities or scientific schools of Germany.

     The general supervision is under a Council, consisting of a President of the
Council, who is a Privy Councillor, and twenty-four members, including the Pre-

sident and the Director of the Reichsanstalt ; of the other members, about ten are

professors, or heads of physical or astronomical observatories connected with the

principal universities in Germany. Three are selected from leading firms in Ger-

many, representing mechanical, optical, and electric science, and the remainder are

principal scientific officials connected with the Departments of War and Marine,

from the Royal Observatory at Potsdam, and from the Eoyal Commission for

"Weights and Measures.

    This Council is summoned to meet when required, but it generally meets in
the winter, for such time as may be necessary, for examining tlie research work
done in the first division during the previous year, and for laying down the scheme

for research for the ensuing year, as well as for suggesting any requisite improve-
ments in the second division.

     It will he seen that the safeguard for ensuring good research work on subjects
of general interest and importance lies first in the judicious selection of the Presi-
dent, Director, and Professors of the Reichsanstalt, and after them in a careful
selection of the members of the Board of Management, because they not only

arrange the subjects for research, but they also hold' an annual stock-taking of work
done in the department.

  _ Members of the Board of Management, who are appointed from the various

scientific establishments all over Germany, are carefully selected, and are remu-
nerated for their services.

     In this country, whilst the more enlightened of the County Councils are form-
ing polytechnic institutions intended to approximate to the higher grade polytech-

nics in Germany, we have no Government Department which approximates to the

Reichsanstalt.

     The Standards Department was attached to the Board of Trade in 1878, with
the duty of mak-ing standards of length, weight, and capacity, and in 1889 it was
further empowered to make such new standards for the measurements of electricity,

temperature, and gravities as appeared to be of use for trade. This department

possesses, moreover, under the Gas Acts, powers as to a standard of light.

     The object of this department is to meet the requirements of trade. Neither
the Nation nor the Government appear to have realised the enormous savin"- of
time and labour which would result from systematic standards for every branch of
                 --

scientific research, coupled with arrangementa for comparison easily accessible to
students. There would seem to be some difficulty in alterlag the functions of the
Standards Department so as to combine research with its present duties, nor is it
established in a situation where delicate observations could be carried on.

    The Incorporated Kew Observatorj', which is administered by a Committee

under the Iloyal Society, is situated in an almost ideal locality for observations.
It already conducts, on a small scale, some experimental work, and it appears to
afford a nucleus whicli might be gradually extended into an establishment analo-
gous to the lieichsanstalt, provided the Government would countenance its exten-
sion on its present site, and aid the scheme with a grant of money. Under these

Acircumstances, I would suggest that the Committee of Section upon National

-- --Laboratories which appears not to have been re-appointed at Oxford be now

renewed with members added from Section B and Section G, and that it be re-

quested to report :

        (a) Upon the functions which an establishment of this nature should fulfil.
        (b) Upon the system which shoidd be adopted for its control and manage-

                    ment.

The Association would then be in a position to approach the Government with

Kewa definite proposal, either for the utilisation of the Incorporated  Observatory

for the purpose, or for some other plan.

2. On the Teaching of Geometrical Drawing in Schools.
                   By O. Henrici, F.R.S.

The teaching of geometrical drawing in schools is in many respects unsatisfac-

tory. It is at pi-esent chiefly regulated by the examinations of the Science and

Art Department and those for the entrance into the army. At some schools there

are also special classes for those boys who intend to become engineers. The re-

quirements for these are at present quite different. It seems desirable, and not at

all difficult, to assimilate the teaching by laying down one rational course, so that

all pupils at schools can receive the same instruction, at least in the earlier stages.

This should be done first of all without any regard to examinations, the only ob-

ject being the teaching of the ' art ' of geometrical drawing. The syllabus for any

examination should then be drawn up in conformity with such a course.

To bring this about a committee of the British Association seems to be the

most appropriate means. It would be the duty of such a committee to lay down

the outlines of the course, and therefore it would be premature to say much about

Aat at present.  few points, however, may here be touched upon.

First of all it seems necessary to free the subject, at least at the beginning,

from all connection with Euclid and his constructions ; in fact, geometrical drawing

should be begun long before Euclid is tackled. Euclid only knows two drawing

instruments, the straight-edge and the pair of compasses for drawing straight lines

and circles. To these should be added at once the set-squares and sooner or later

the T-square.

     The drawing of parallels and perpendiculars should be done by their aid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

bisection of lines by their aid and by trial. The first object should be to draw

·accurately.

   A great many figures can be drawn, first without circles, where the pupil can

judge /or /uVwse^f whether his drawing is accurate.

    Rules for transforming figures by stretching or by shear may follow, leading to

equal and t& similar figures.
     Such a course will be the very best introduction to Euclid, and will form a

natural connection between the Kindergarten, which is steadily gaining in import-
ance, and the systematic geometry of Euclid.

     Solutions of problems which require a knowledge of Euclid should be attempted

"Only when good progress has been made in this art of drawing.

                        A joint Meeting with Section B.

    The following Papers were read :

              1. The Refraction and Viscosity of Argon and Helium.

                            By Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S.

   --As compared with dry air, the refraction (/x 1) of argon is 0'961, and that of

helium (prepared hy Professor Ramsay) is as low as 0'146.
     Dry air being again taken as the standard, the viscosity of argon is 1-21, and

that of helium is 0'96.

2. On Specific Refraction and the Periodic Law, tvith reference to Argon
            and other Elements. By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.R.S.

     In 1869, 1877, and 1883 the author had shown that the specific refractive

energies of tlie metallic elements are usually in the inverse order of their combinino-
proportions, and that the specific refractive energies of the elements in general are
to a certain extent a periodic function of their atomic weights.

     The present communication refers to some developments of these old obser-

vations.

     (1) Argon. The specific refractive energy of argon gas, as reckoned from Lord
Rayleigh 's data, is 0-159. Deeley had suggested that this property might throw
light upon the question whether the atomic weight is about 20 or double that
figure. The following are the specific refractive energies of the elements with
atomic weights between 12 and 23, with the insertion of argon. Carbon, 0-417 ·
nitrogen, 0-236; oxygen, 0-194; fluorine, 003 (?) ; argon, 0-159; sodium, 0-209^
Argon appears to be here in place on the rise which follows the great descent from
carbon to fluorine. It does not equally well fit the neighbourhood of calcium, 0-250.

If the atomic weight be 19-94, the molecular refraction will be 315, which is
almost the same number as that for oxygen gas, 310, or nitrogen gas, 3-30.

     (2) The fact that the specific refractive energies of the univalent metals are
generally inversely as the square roots of their atomic weights is conflrmed by
farther research, the product of the two being about 1-3. The same observation is
now extended to the earthy metals i i the second column of Mendel(5eft"s table the
products in that case being fully 1-4. The rule does not apply to the halogens in
column 7. As to column 8, iron, palladium, platinum, and gold all give products

which are far higher. This confirms the telief that gold is not rightly placed in

column 1.
     (3) It is known that the refraction of a salt when dissolved in water is often

slightly modified by the proportional amount of the solvent. The author and Mr.
Hibbert have recently found that salts of the metallic elements in columns 1 and 2
of Mendel(5efF's table show an increased refraction on dilution, those of metals in

column 8 a diminished refraction.

   A3. Discussion ' On the Evidence to be Gathered as to the Simple or Cora-

pound character of a Gas, from the Constitution of its Spectrum,^ was opened

--by Professor A. Schuster and Lord Rayleigh, and the following Papers were

read :

   4. The Constiticents of Cleveite Gas. By C. Runge and F. Paschen.

     As the spectrum of the gas contains two sets of lines, each consisting of three
' series,' and no other lines, we may, according to the analogy of other spectra,
draw the conclusion that it consists of two, and not more than two, elements.
The yellow line D,, belongs to the heavier of the two elements, which therefore

should alone be called helium.

   We have separated the two elements to a certain extent by a method of

difi"usion, the lighter constituent streaming more easily through a plug of asbestos.
It was shown that the lines in the visible and in the ultra-red part of the
spectrum ascribed to the heavier constituent are less intense relatively to the other
lines the earlier the stream of the gas is cut off.

    The same conclusion that the gas consists of two elements may also be drawn,

first from the spectrum of the sun's limb, where the stronger lines of the heavier
constituent are always present, while the stronsfer lines of the lighter constituent

are only seen once in every four times. On the other hand in the spectrum of
Nova AurigiB at its first appearance we have the opposite case, the lines of the
lighter constituent being far more prominent.

On Motions competent to 2^^'0(iuce Groups of Lines which have been
    observed in Actual Spectra. By G, Johnstone Stoney, M.A., JJ.Sc,

     F.E.S.

In most of the spectra that consist of lines very remarkable groups present

themselves, in which the lines are seen to be associated into definite series. In such

cases, except under special circumstances, we may safely presume that all the lines

of a group arise from the motion of a single electron in every molecule of the gas.

Very striking examples of such groups are present in the absorption spectrum

of oxygen and in the bright line spectrum of carbon. The oxygen of the earth's

Aatmosphere produces the great group of double lines in the solar spectrum, as

Bwell as the very similar great group, and the a group. It also produces a group

more refrangible than D, about which we know less. This group is much fainter

than the others, and it is only under exceptional circumstances that it can be seen at

all in the solar spectrum. Each of the other three groups can be distinguished into

two sub-groups, which from their appearance have been called a head and a train.

The general features of these three groups are the same, and Mr. Higgs has made

Ba careful geometrical analysis of one of them, the great  group. ^ From his

analysis we may infer that the head and the trjvin are due to motions in the mole-

cules which are distinct, although related to one another. This conclusion receives

further support from the circumstance that in the double lines of ' the head ' it is

the violet component of each pair which is the stronger, while in the train it is the

red component of each pair which is the stronger.

supposition that the motion of each electron is an orbit of some kind going on
within the molecules, it can be shown that the partials of the motion of the electron
·which causes the lines are elliptic partials, and that where an elliptic partial suffers

an apsidal perturbation, it divides into two circular sub-partials, giving rise to the
Wetwo constituents of a double line.
                                      may infer from this that the sub-partials

correspondiug to the red constituents of the fourteen or more double lines of the

Btrain of are circular motions revolving one way, and that all the violet consti-

tuents of these double lines result from circular motions revolving the other way.
     In order to advance beyond this point it is necessary to make two further

hypotheses which probably are both true. Two hypotheses must here be ventured

upon because observations with the spectroscope give us no information as to the
phases of the elliptic partials or the planes in which they lie. One hypothesis that

recommends itself is that the circular sub-partials belonging to a connected series

Bof double lines, e.g., to the train of the great group, lie in one plane. Another

hypothesis which we may venture to make, as a preliminary working hypothesis, is
that the amplitude of the motion of the electron has its maximum value at starting,
i.e., when that event has occurred at the close of a struggle between two molecules

which has set up the motion of the electron, which continues during the compara-

tive repose of the quiet, undisturbed journey in which the molecule is indulged

after its encounter.

    With these assumptions it is possible to synthesise all the motions causing the

red constituents of the double lines into one motion, which is, however, not circular,

but a slowly contracting spiral; and a similar resultant spiral motion turning the

opposite way is furnished bj' the sub-partials forming the violet constituents.
While these spirals are being traversed the radii or semi-amplitudes of the circular

motions of which they are composed, and which correspond to the individual line?

in the spectrum, may become shorter or longer owing to the escape of energy to

the aether, or absorption of energy from it ; so that the actual orbits are spirals which

maybe somewhat inside or somewhat outside those which result from the assump-

tion that the radii retain their length. These two spiral motions combine at each

instant into a .^single elliptic motion so elongated that it is nearly a linear vibration

and this elliptic motion continues to represent what occurs, if subjected to the f.ve

following perturbations :

A1. decrease of amplitude.
A2. diminution of periodic time.
A3. slow apsidal motion in a direction opposite to that in which the revolution

of the electron in the orbit takes place.

   A4. slight fluttering motion which may be represented by a very shallow wave

running rapidly round the ellipse.

   A5. further slight modification of the form of the ellipse which takes the form

of a secular perturbation.

Accordingly we arrive at the conclusion that an elliptic motion undergoing these

perturbations is such a motion of an electron as would produce the entire series of

Alines in the train of B.   similar motion would produce the train of A, of a, and

of each of the other similar groups, if such exist in the spectrum of oxygen. These

elliptic motions undergoing perturbations may be appropriately called mega-partials

in their relation to the actual orbit described in o.xygen by the electron that

produces all these trains of lines, since that orbit is the resultant which we should

get by superposing the motions in these few mega-partials.

   A similar treatment applied to ' the head ' of any of the oxygen groups shows

that it, too, arises from an elliptic motion subject to perturbations, the chief

differences being in the law connecting the falling-off of amplitude and the

periodic time ; that the quick, fluttering perturbation is absent ; and that the apsidal

motion takes place in the opposite direction. In oxygen the strength of the lines

of each sub-group fades out towards the red. When the fading is in this direction,

the periodic time decreases as the amplitude falls off. Whereas when, as in the

carbon spectrum, the lines fade out towards the violet, the periodic time becomes

longer as. the amplitude decreases. And, finally, if the lines present themselves,

                                      ER 2
612 REPORT-- 1895.

when plotted on a map of oscillation frequencies, as disposed sj-mmetrically on
either side of a common centre, this indicates that the periodic time continues

unchanged during the shortening of the amplitude.
      This suggests the cause of the width of spectral lines in general, so far as their

width is not merely apparent, i.e., due to the Doppler effect of the translational
 motions of the molecules, or to the breadth of the slit of the spectroscope. The
rest of the Avidth of the line, as seen, is its true physical width, and seems to be
due to the interchange of energy between the molecule and the rether. This

leads to diminished amplitude ; and this reduction of the amplitude maybe accom-

panied by either a reduction, or an increase, or a persistence unaltered of the

periodic time, according to the way in which the motion of the electron is
 dynamically associated with the rest of the events which go on within the

 molecule. If the periodic time decreases, this gives rise to a ruling fading out
towards the red ; if there be an increase of the periodic time, the shading is towards

the violet ; while if the line fades out both ways symmetrically, there is no change
in the periodic timp. The relative intensities and the spacings of the lines of the
ruling depend on the law which connects the escape of energy and the shorten-
ing of the semi-amplitude, and in its turn this law depends on the dynamical
relations in which the parts of the molecule stand to one another. The excessively
fine rulings of which the widths of individual lines consist can probably not be
seen otherwise than as a shading, unless perhaps in some very few exceptional
instances, owing to their being blurred together by the Doppler effect.

    We have attributed these very fine rulings to the interchange of energy with

the sether. On the other hand, the more conspicuous rulings, such as those we

have been studying in oxygen and carbon, seem to be associated with the trans-

ference of energy from one motion within the molecule to another. This may be

briefly described by saying that the widths of the individual lines and their being
in various ways shaded off' are due to radiation, while that they are arranged in
Eeriea is due to conduction.

the motion was in circles round the axis, and in which the fluid external to the

that subsequently the terms containing powers and products of the eccentricitiea,

inclination, and ratio of the parallaxes could be calculated in turn, the lower orders

being taken first. This point must have presented itself to Laplace and Pontdcoulant

in their respective theories ; but it is brought out more clearly in those treatises

where the object is not to obtain a complete analytical development, but to exhibit

the method of procedure. In Delaunay's theory this point does not present itself,

but by modifying Delaunay's theory so as to reduce the number of variables from

six to" two the variational terms might be calculated independently, whereas by no

process could the other terms be calculated before the variational terms.

These considerations point to the curve indicated by the variational terms being

treated as the intermediary orbit in  preference  to  the  ellipse                                  but  it was  not  till

the year 1877 that this idea was developed. Dr. G. W. Hill then published three

papers in the tirst volume of the ' American Journal,' papers which Poincar^

describes as containing the germ of the greater part of the progress that astronomy

has since made.

     Relatively to the sun's mean place the variation terms define a closed curve

which the moon under suitable initial conditions could describe, if the sun's

parallax and eccentricity were zero. The curve is symmetrical in all four quadrants,
and remains symmetrical about the line of syzygies, when the sun's parallax is taken
into account. " Dr. Hill has drawn the variation curve for ditlerent ratios of the
month to the year. The curve for small values of this ratio does not ditfer much from
a circle, but is slightly elongated in quadrature. This elongation increases with the
length of the month, and when there are only 1-78265 months to the year the curve
lias cusps on the line of quadratures. Such an orbit must certainly be unstable, and
by a discussion of Jacobi's equation of relative energy Dr. Hill makes it appear

probable that instability sets in for a much smaller value of the ratio. No numerical

limit has, however, been obtained for stabihty. M. Poincar(5 has succeeded in
obtaining the general shape of these curves when continued beyond the cusped
curve. The orbit first crosses the line of quadratures obliquely, and then recrosses

at a greater distance at right angles, then returns to the first intersection, thus

forming a loop, and ultimately forms a closed curve with two loops, six intersec-

tions with the line of quadratures and two with that of syzygies. Dr. Hill has

also calculared algebraically and numerically and with extreme accuracy the

coefficients of the diflerent periodic terms that "define the variation curve.

     In the older lunar theories the physical meaning of the quantity that in

undisturbed motion denoted the eccentricity disappeared upon the introduction of

the disturbance with the ellipse upon whicli it depended for its definition. At the

conclusion of the theories it was defined analytically by equating a given function
of it to the coefficient of one of the periodic "terms. Such a definition is merely
analytical, and has no physical interpretation. The quantity, in fact, is a mere

constant of integration. It is not even correct to say that it reduces to the

eccentricity when the sun's mean motion is put zero. The eccentricity of the

ellipse obtained by putting the sun's mean motion zero is a function of the constants

of integration and of the position of the sun's apse, and of the sun's parallax. By

Dr. Hill's investigations, however, a physical meaning is restored. It is a parameter

defining the amplitude of the oscillation that takes place about that state of steady

motion relatively to the sun that Dr. Hill has shown can take place, provided only

the sun's eccentricity be negligible. With the notion of eccentricity, the notion of

the apse of the older theories becomes indistinct. The so-called apse is certainly
not a point where the' moon is moving at right angles to its radius vector. Ac-
cording to Dr. Hill's theory, the period of revolution with respect to the apse now
becomes the period of the oscillation about steady motion. In like maimer the

inclination of the orbit may be considered as another oscillation about steady motion,

the inclination constant of integration defines its amplitude, and the period of

revolution with respect to the node, which isnot accurately the point of intersection

with the ecliptic, is now the period of this second oscillation. In accordance with
the general theory of small oscillations, the two modes of oscillation can co-exist in
complete independence so long as the squares of the amplitudes are negligible. The

two periods in such a case depend only on the circumstances of steady motion, in

this case on the ratio of the month to the year. The periods in the actual case,
however, must be corrected by terms dependino; on squares and higher powers of
the sun's eccentricity and the two parameters defininp: the amplitudes.

     In a paper in the ' Acta Mathematica,' vol. viii., Dr. Hill tinds the period of a
small oscillation of the first of the two kinds mentioned. His method involves

the consideration of an infinite determinant. He states that there can hardly be a

doubt that the determinant is convergent, but M. Poincare has submitted the

question to a rigid investigation.^ He concludes that an infinite determinant,

when the constituents of the leading diagonal are all unity, converges absolutely
and unifoi'mly if the sum of all the other elements is finite. Any determinant can

be reduced so that the elements of the leading diagonal are all unity, provided that
the product of these elements is finite. Dr. Hill's determinant satisfies these

conditions when the length of the month is sufficiently small. To complete the
proof it is necessary to notice that M. Poincar^, in his ' Mdcanique Ci5leste,' proves

that the series defining Dr. Hills variation curve converge for sufficiently small
values of the length of the month.

     At the conclusion of hispaper, Dr. Hill solved his infinite determinantal equation,
and obtained the principal part of the motion of the apse with great arithmetical
accuracy. The value he obtains difi'ers in the fourth significant figure from that

calculated from Delaunay's series ; it also agrees well with the observed value,
thus verifying a prediction of Delaunay's, as far as the apse is concerned, that the
remainder of his series would bring calculation into agreement with observation.
Dr. Hill has lately calculated an algebraic value to eleven terms for the principal

part of the motion of the perigee. He concludes by replacing the ratio of th©

month to the year by another parameter, empirically determined so as to increase

the convergence of the last terms calculated. This last step, however, does not
appear to be in any degree useful, as the convergency of the series near its tenth
term throws no light on the convergency of the remainder.

     The question of convergency of the series obtained in the lunar theory had
hardly been investigated before Poincare and Lindstedt. Formal solutions to the
seventh order and arithmetical solutions have been obtained, but it cannot be
assumed from the close agreement of the two that the coefficients can be repre-
sented by the algebraic series. Poincare has shown, however, that in certain cases
periodic solutions mu.st exist, and as a special case the series for the coeflicients of
the variational terms must converge for sufficiently small values of the ratio of the
month to the year. The motion of the node, so far as it depends on the ratio of the

mean motions only, had been investigated by Adams before Dr. Hill's work on
the perigee was published. Adams also obtained an infinite determinant. In the
arithmetical work, however, he used a dift'erent value of the ratio of the mean

motions to that used by Delaunay and by Dr. Hill. It is an illustration of the
almost unnecessary accuracy of the numerical work that it should have been
carried to fifteen decimal places, whereas the ratio of the mean motions, certainly
by far the easiest quantity to determine by observation, can only be depended upon
to seven places. I have recomputed the principal part of the motion of the node

using Dr. Hill's numbers. It may be noticed that the arithmetical value in this

case does not, as in the case of the perigee, justify Delaunay's prediction that the
remainder of his series would account for the discrepancy between theory and

observation.

     Dr. Hill's method of procedure is to use rectangular co-ordinates, the axes of
reference rotating round the ecliptic with a velocity equal to the sun's mean motion.
The calculation of the variation terms by this method is perhaps not so short as it

would be by some other method possibly the best way to obtain them would be

theory is so simple for the calculation of the higher inequalities. For each new set

of coefficients the problem can be quickly reduced to the solution of a system of
linear simultaneous equations. The principal parts of the motions of the perigee
and node are given by infinite determinants : the further approximations appear aa

additional unknown quantities to be determined by the simultaneous linear equa-
tions. The solution has to proceed by continued approximation, and is exceedingly
laborious. In an admirable paper in the current number of the American Journal,

Prof. E. W. Brown has shown how the new part of the motion of the perigee and

node can in all cases be evolved from the terms previously calculated. This con-
sideration not only shortens very considerably the labour of the continued approxi-
mations, but it enables us to regard one of the simultaneous equations as an equation

--of verification. Professor Brown's paper undoubtedly the most valuable of all
--the papers that are based upon Dr. Hill's researches concludes with some exten-

sions of Adams's theorems connecting the mean value of the parallax with the
motions of the node and perigee. These extensions possess an analytical interest,

but as applied to the development of a solution of the problem of three bodies in
series, they only provide some equations of verification of a value far inferior to

those investigated in the earlier part of his paper.

     The following advances have been made towards a complete development of
the problem of three bodies. Dr. Hill calculated the variation terms ; Professor
Brown the terms depending on the ratio of the parallaxes, the terms depending on
the first, and subsequently the second and third powers of the moon's eccentricity
also the terms depending on the first power of the sun's eccentricity, and also the
product terms containing the first powers of both the eccentricities. These latter
are the only product terms hitherto calculated by Dr. Hill's methods. The con-
vergence of the series Delaunay obtains in his literal development is exceedingly
slow, and the arithmetical values show a residue in some of Delaunay's series of
over one second. I have calculated terms depending on the fiist three powers of

the inclination. Besides this, Dr. Hill has obtained the principal part of the motioi*

of the perigee, and Adams the principal part of the motion of the node. Professor
Brown has calculated the correction to the motion of the perigee depending on the

square of the eccentricity, and I have calculated the correction to the motion of th&
node depending on the square of the inclination.

10. The Relation between the Morphological Syimnetry and the Optical

              Symmetry of Crystals. By William Barlow.

Starting from the well-known facts of the influence of the presence of

molecular matter generally on the velocity of light, and of the directional optical

properties of crystals, the author reaches the conclusion that ether-movements

which take place in the same crystal in different directions experience different

degrees of resistance and retardation, so that a state of things prevails roughly

comparable to what would happen if a space occupied by a crowd of people were

studded with posts  arranged  on    parallel  lines  and  evenly distributed                                                                                      the move-
                                                                                                                                                               ;

ments of the crowd as it surged to and fro would be less impeded in some direc-

tions than in others, especially if the posts were not round, but of similar sectioa
sameways orientated. In the case of both the ether and the crowd what are

compared are the collective resistances in each direction, differences in the retarda-
tion experienced by diflferent particles or persons moving side by side in the same

direction not being discriminated.

Even if the crystal emploj-ed belongs to the cubic system, and is therefore

isotropic, the ether-movements must, as in the case of less symmetrical crystals,

experience diff'erent retardation in diff'ereut directions ; and the necessary deduc-
tion from this is that if tbe influence of a homogeneous molecular structure on

light depends on t/ie arrangement of the molecular matter, it is an average, effect,

the velocity of a ray in any given direction depending, not merely on the resistance

to ether-movement experienced in some single direction definitely related to the

direction of polarisation of the ray, hut on that experienced in a number of different

directions inclined to one another. The writer cites in support of this conclusion

the fact that in crystals belonging to the less symmetrical crystal systems, irk
                                                                                              --

which a change of velocity accompanies any continuous change of direction, this
change of velocity is always a very smooth one, and not abrupt.

     Alter remarking that if the velocity of a ray in any given direction were
dependent equally on the resistances oflered to ether-movement in every direction,
this velocity would in all cases be entirely independent of any particular direction

or directions in the structure, which would in all cases be isotropic, he says that
the experimental facts show that the truth lies between the two extremes indi-

cated                              that the velocity of a  ray  depends neither  on  all the  resistances to ether-
                                ;

movement experienced in all directions taken equally, nor on the resistance

experienced in a single solitary direction, but depends equally, or almost equally,

on the resista7ices afforded in all the directions included within some wide limits of

angular inclination, this being the only kind of relation which would be in

harmony with the great smoothness of the change of velocity presented when a

continuous change of direction is made.

He then suggests that the simplest sort of relation which the velocity can be

conceived to bear to the resistances offered by the structure to ether-movement is

for the resistance whose direction is that of the polarisation of the ray i.e., the

--direction in which the algebraically deduced wave-vibration takes place to exert

a maximura influence, and the etiect of the resistances in directions inclined to

this to diminish as the inclination increases, the decrement of influence for direc-

tions near the direction which furnishes the maximum eflect being, however, very

small indeed.

    He points out that if this simple kind of relation obtains, the velocity Jigure--

i.e., the figure whose radii express the different velocities proper to diflerent direc-

--tions of polarisation for rays traversing a crystal must exhibit a smoothed cur-

vature derived indeed, but having a very different aspect, from that of the

corrugated surface whose radii would express the relative facility of ether-
movement taking place in different directions in the same crystal ; and that the

simplest conceivable result of such a smoothing or averaging will be for the

velocity-figure to approximate as closely as we please to the result obtained by

treating the vebcity appropriate to any direction of polarisation whatever as the

resultant of three components acting in some particular three widely separated

directions, each component, in harmony with the averaging referred to above,
being greater or less as the direction of the resultant which is being resolved lies
nearer to or further from its direction, and being zero when the resultant lies in
the plane of the remaining two components. The relative lie of the three direc-

tions will, of course, depend on the nature of the crystal structure. The reason
for taking three directions is that this is the least number which can be employed
consistently with generality.

    He proceeds to show that the simplest figure thus obtainable is an ellipsoid, of

which the three axes are conjugate diameters, and calls attention to the fact that
the number of the sets of three axes which will fulfil the requisite conditions in
any given case is unlimited.

     From the fact that the veloritj'-figure is in all crystals found to be an ellipsoid

(specialised, indeed, in some of the crystal systems), he finally argues that the

velocity of a ray is an average effect of the different resistances to ether-movement

<ffered in different directions of the nature above e.rplained ; and that the combi-

nation or averaging by which so simple a figure as the ellipsoid is reached must
not only extend over a wide range of resistances for each velocity, but also that it
must be so nearly uniform in its application throughoid some considerable j)ortion of
this range as to preclude entirely all merely local effects of the structural features

of the crystal on the contour of the velocity -figure.
     In closing, the writer remarks that the directions which give maximura or

minimum velocity--1.(?., those of the principal axes of the ellipsoid-- will not

necessarily be directions of maximum or minimum facility of ether-movement, the

indents and protuberances of the corrugated figure whose radii express the relative

facility of ether-movement in diflerent directions not being traceable as such on
the velocity-figure.

Also that tue directions of the principal axes of the velocity-ellipsoid will not

more symmetrical systems in which the positions of these axes are fixed by

symmetrical considerations.

     _A similar observation applies to the absorption-figure for monochromatic light,
which is also an ellipsoid.

     The fact that the elastidty-Jigure of crystals is a surface of a higher order than

an ellipsoid is due to its being the outcome of a compounding and averaging whose
scope is more limited and not so uniform as that above referred to.

 12. On AhsohUe and Relative Motion. By Trot J. T). 'Everett, F.H.S.

    Though there is no test hy which we can distinguish between absolute rest and

uniform velocity of translation, D'Alembert's principle furnishes a test by which
deviation from such uniformity can be detected. Every deviation produces the
game effects which would be produced by bodily forces opposite to the actual
changes of velocity. The intensity of the apparent bodily force is equal in each

case to the absolute acceleration.

    What is called centrifugal force is an apparent bodily force directed outwards

from the centre of curvature of the body's path, and having an intensity equal to
the distance from this centre, multiplied by the square of the absolute angular
velocity. Angular velocity, unlike velocity of translation, involves acceleration

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and by comparing the accelerations of different points of a rigid body we can
measure the absolute angular velocity of the body. The slope of a conical pen-
dulum and the concavity of the surface of the liquid in a revolving vessel are
phenomena whicli depend on absolute velocity of horizontal rotation ; and another

measure of horizontal angular velocity is furnished by differences of pressure at
different points in a horizontal tube full of liquid.

                               By W. H. Everett, B.A.

      Tlie case of a solenoid of circular section is tlie only one hitherto investigated,
and this has been done by considerations derived from magnetic shells. In this
paper the problem is approached by a more direct method, and general solutions
are obtained in a form which can be readily worked out to numerical values.

Special application is made to the case of a rectangular (or polygonal) solenoid, the
component forces being expressed in finite terms. For a very long solenoid of
any form of section the longitudinal force in either of the end sections is shown to
be exactly the same at all points, and in any solenoid the longitudinal force is
shown to be more uniform in the end sections than in the medial section. As a
particular case the method gives the component forces due to a plane circuit at
any point in its field ; and a simple expression is found for the force, at any interior
point, due to a circular current.

       14. On the Law of Error in the Case of Correlated Variations.
                              By S. H. BuRBURY, F.R.S.

     If we have a great number, N, of independent magnitudes, each liable to

variation according to any law of its own, but remaining" always finite, the chance

that their sum, each divided by VN, shall lie between .r and x + dx is proportional

to e~'^^-dx, where h is a constant. The proof of that proposition is originally due
to Poisson. The first application of it was to errors of observation, each of the

N* magnitudes ' aforesaid being such an error, and the observations being supposed

independent.

     Modern writers, among others Mr. F. Galton and Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth, have
substituted for the single magnitude given by each independent -observation a
group of mutually dependent or ' correlated ' magnitudes, and for the single square
forming the index in e"'"- a quadratic function, i.e., sums of square and products
of the correlated magnitudes. If, for instance, they be denoted by x and v, the
expression corresponding to e-'"W.r will be e-^'"'^-+'''^'J+'^y\hdl/. The coefficient

d expresses the fact of ' correlation ' between .r and ?/.
     The object of the following paper is (1) to extend the purely mathematical

investigation hitherto applied to the case of single magnitudes to the case of groups
of magnitudes, the members of each group, although ' correlated ' with one

--another, being still supposed independent of any other group in this I only

follow the lines of the known proof; and (2) to show how in certain cases the
method may be extended to groups which do not possess this property of mutual

independence.

representing the state of the same material system, defined by n variables, at succes-

   We cannot therefore at once apply our investigation of Part I. to the series of

functions /a, _/i, &c.

     10. It is now shown that in cases where the condition of complete independ-

ence is not satisfied, another condition, called the modified condition of independence

may be satisfied. That is, namely, that although the 6's are not independent of

>Tthe a's for such values of the time r, yet it may be the case that when r= or

where T is a definite time, the Vs, are independent of the a's, or -~ vanishes. It is

the time variation of I, . . . ^,, must depend not only on the values of k\ · · · In for
the time being, but also, in some appreciable degree, on external fortuitous causes.

is the time T which, as the interval between two successive states of the system,

makes the variables in one of those states independent of those in the other.

               By Eric Stuart Bruce, M.A. Oxon., F.R.Met.Soc.

     The classification of lightning flashes is already beset with diflSculties. The

object of this paper is to suggest the possibility of Projection Lightning Flashes,
the existence of which would increase the difficulties of classification.

     Sheet lightning refiected on clouds is made up of numerous images of the
lio-htning flash superimposed one upon the other. If there is a cloud with a suffi-
ciently small opening in it between the lightning discharge and a reflecting surface
of clouds, the latter being in an adequate position, on the clouds that otherwise
would have been merely illun^iiiated with sheet lightning will appear the optical
proiection of a lightning flash. If the surface of clouds upon wiiich the image
falls is level, the image will be a perfect reproduction of the lightning flash, save
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                  625

that it is inverted, and to some extent dulled in brilliancy. If, however, the sur-
face of the clouds is irregular, such as those of the cumulus type, the image of the

flash will take the shape of the irregular surface. In this way a zig-zagged flash
with long angles could be formed very like the lightning flashes depicted by

artists.

     If there happen to be more openings than one in the clouds between the flash
and receiving surface, there will be a corresponding reduplication of the flashes,

which may perhaps explain some of the multiple effects observed.

      If projection flashes occur in nature it becomes a question whether the photo-
graphic plate can register them.

o. On some Experiments made with Lord Kelvin's Portable Electrometer.
                         By Abthur Schuster, F.R.S.

Experiments made during a recent trip to Switzerland have demonstrated the

great convenience of Lord Kelvin's portable instrument for the observation of

atmospheric electricity. The electrometer can easily be carried in a knapsack to

almost any place the mountaineer can reach, and the observations are readily per-

formed in a short space of time. The object of the experiments was to learn, if

possible, whether the electric force at great heights is sensibly diff'erent from that

at the sea-level. But o'n'ing to the diiflculty of comparing together observations

made in valleys with those made on mountain peaks, the measurements made

during the past year were entirely of a tentative character, more for the purpose

of testing the working of the instrument than of obtaining any definite results.

The numbers given are only relative, and are referred to an arbitrary unit.

Numerous experiments made in tine weather in the centre of a small meadow

in front of the hotel at Pontresina gave for the electric force, on the average, about

30, while the number obtained on September 13, in Ipswich, in a place rather more

sheltered by surrounding houses, was between 80 and 100.'

    On the so-called ' Diavolezza Pass ' the force was as high as 147 ; on the Isola
Pars, a rocky island, projecting well out of the surrounding glaciers, the number

found was 116. The instrument was taken on August 19 to the top of the Glii-

scheint (12,000 feet), which consists of a ridge of rocks just wide enough for one

man to stand upon. The electric force reached the number 816, while on the snow-

field a few hundred feet below the top, the force was only 170. The top of the

Schafberg gave 357.

On the Morteratsch glacier the numbers were, as a rule, very low, except on one

occasion, when a strong downward wind was blowing ; even then the force was only

42. Half a mile below the foot of the glacier, the numbers were very irregular,

and seemed to depend a good deal on the direction of the wind. On one occasion,

when that direction was frequently changing, a negative electrification was ob-

served whenever the current of air was away from the glacier. This may have

been due to the negative electrification caused by the glacier stream in a way

similar to that in which a similar electrification is produced by a waterfall.

The diurnal variation was observed on one day by taking measurements every

half-hour during the morning and every hour during the afternoon till seven

Ao'clock.  maximum of 36 was observed at 11 a.m. The numbers then fell

irregularly till four o'clock, when tlie record was only 14. After that a rise took
place (31 at 5 p.m. and 29 at 6 P.m.). At 7 p.m. no sensible force could be measured
at all. The wind, which had been blowing up the valley all day, changed in direc-
 tion between six and seven o'clock, and was blowing down the valley when the
 observations had to be discontinued, owing to want of light.

      The author does not draw any conclusions from these observations, but does
not believe that a mere dift'erence in the configuration of the ground is sutHcient to

 account for the great differences in the electric force observed.

             6. On Iridian Thunderstorms. By C. MiciiiE Smith.

      Observation shows that the ordinary hot-weather displays of sheet lightning
take plsice in the region between the sea aud land breezes where there are well-
 marked ascending currents, as shown by the great masses of pillared cumulus

cloud. These clouds are usually in pairs, and much of the sheet lightning consists
of discharges taking place between the two clouds forming such a pair. The land
and sea breezes difler from each other in dryness and in dustiness, and many
observations seem to show that thunderstorms are originated only where dry,
dusty, and moist, and comparatively d listless air-currents meet. This explains

why electrical phenomena are observed only in that part of a cyclone in which
the air from the sea meets the air from the laud, and why ' nor'-westers ' are

accompanied by such brilliant electrical displays. Dry, dusty air is usually nega-
tively^ electrified relatively to tlie earth, while the sea breeze is usually positively
electrified. The electrical displays talce place in clouds that are rapidly sinking,
and such clouds are ofteu surrounded by an iridescent fringe (the colours of which
are due probably to dust and moisture, as explained by Aitken, composed of the
smaller panicles left behind by the sinldng cloud).

     The matter, however, is not so simple. All agree that notes corresponding- to
the difference tone are heard under some circumstances, but many deny that they
are produced as Von Helmholtz supposed, and would therefore deny that they are
combinatioa tones. Again, Von Helmholtz, who was the most prominent sup-
porter of the objective reality of these notes, was also the author of the theory
which explains their production within the ear itself.

    It is therefore better to begin with the second question. Do notes correspond-

ing in frequency with the combination tones accompany the two fundamental
notes as air-waves under any circumstances ?

     The physical evidence for and against an affirmative answer is as following :

   Von Helmholtz stated that he had set membranes in motion by combination

tones produced by the siren, and air resonators in motion by combination tones

produced by the harmonium (Ellis, p. 157). I am not aware that the experiment

with membranes has been repeated in the same form, but 0. Lummer (' Verb,

Phys. Gesell.,' Berlin, 1886, No. 9, p. 66) claimed to have detected the tones by

means of the microphone. On the other hand, Konig (p. 130) denies that com-

bination tones  are reinforced  by resonators                                                                  and  Bosanquet satisfied himself that
                                                                                                            ;

the ordinary first difference tone is incapable of exciting a resonator.

   More recently, the writer and Mr. Edser, using as a resonator a tuning-fork

of frequency 64, the motions of which were detected by attaching to one of the

prongs a mirror which formed one of a system by which Michelson's interference

bands were produced, have obtained evidence of the objective character of the sum-

mation and difference tones produced by a siren. They have confirmed these

results in the case of the summation tone by a Eayleigh vane-resonator as modi-

fied by Boys ('Phil. Mag.,' April 1895, p. 341).

   The only objection which, as far as the writer knows, has been broug'ht against

these experiments is that  the tones detected must be of very small intensity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Mr. Bosanquet has stated (in a letter) that he does not wish to be understood as

denying the existence of very feeble combination tones.

   It is unnecessary to quote experiments made by various observers with tunino--

forks, as the use of these instruments is in general opposed to the directions and

theories of Helmholtz. (Ellis, pp. 157, 158.)

    On the whole, then, the evidence appears to be in favour of the view that

objective notes of the same frequency as the combination tones do exist, at all

events in special cases. Their relative intensity to the fundamental notes has not

been determined, and is probably small.

  --Turning next to questions of theory, three explanations have been given of

objective combination tones viz., that they are due (1) to beats, (2) to finite dis-

placements of the vibrating particles, and (3) to intermittence.

    Among other objections to the first theory, Helmholtz pointed out that it

would not explain the summation tone. (Ellis, p. 156).

   Hence Konig suggested that the summation tone might be due to the beats of

partials (Konig, p. 126). This explanation requires that, if ;j and q are the fre-

quencies of the fundamentals, jo + rj = n (p - q) where n is an integer. The writer and

Mr. Edser have, however, obtained evidence of the objective existence of the summa-

tion tone when =;> / y 16 / 9, so that n = 25 / 7 {loc. cit. p. 352). (See Ellis, p. 630.)
Appunn and Preyer have suggested that the summation tone is the beat tone

tetween the first partial of the higher note and the difference tone, for

~P -- (li -q)=l} + q- Konig (p. 127) strongly opposes the adequacy of this explana-

tion, which is contrary to his own observations on beats, and which fails to explain
why the difference tone should not produce equally permanent effects by beating

with the first partial of the lower note, thus giving 2q'^{p -- q) = ?,q --p or p -- Sq.

    The theory of finite displacements is due to Helmholtz, who has shown (Ellis,

p. 412) that if the elastic forces are not symmetrical about the position of equili-

brium, the fundamental tones will be accompanied by the second partials and the

difference and summation tones.

    He has, however, also proved (Ellis, p. 420) that if in an instrument such as

the siren the opening of one hole afl'ects the pressure under which the air is simul-

                                                                                                                    SS2

taneously escaping out of the other, the quantity of air escaping may be repre-

sented in the simplest case by such a formula as

       Q = C(l-sin27rm)f) {l-sm2Trnt)

          -- --= C [1 - sin 2n- vit - sin Stt nt + |^ {cos Srr (m 7i)t cos 2rr (m + n) t\ ],

thus giving rise to the first difference and summation tones.

   A somewhat similar theory has since been elaborated by Terquem. (' Annales

d'Ecole Normale,' 1870, p. 356).

    At present it must be considered to be open to qiiestion whether the objective

combination tones given by the siren are due to finite displacement or to inter-
mittence, or to both causes combined.

3. On the Thermal Conductivities of Mixtures of Liquids.
                  By Charles H. Lees, D.Sc.

The author has carried out a number of determinations of the thermal conduc-

tivities of mixtures of liquids by a method analogous to that of Christiansen, but

with the heat supplied electrically and the temperature measured by means of

thermo-j unctions. For the mixtures of water, glycerine and alcohols experimented

on, the conductivities are found to be less than the values calculated from the

amounts and thermal conductivities of the constituents, and the author believes
Athat this will be found to be a general law.
                                               possible explanation may be found

in the inability of one of the molecules of a mixture to take up and transmit the

particular kind of vibration executed by the other.

For solutions of salts and gases in water the author finds conductivities less

than that of water, in agreement with the results obtained by Jager.

4. A Method of Comparing the Heats of Evaforation of Different Liquids
     at their JJoilinr/ Points. By Professor W. Ramsay, Ph.D., F.R.S.,

     University College, London, and Miss Dorothy Marshall, B.Sc,

      University College, London.

      This method consists in making the liquid boil by passing an electric current
through a wire immersed in it.

      The liquid is put into a glass bulb enclosed in an outer jacket filled with

Tapour of the same liquid. An open tube is attached to the top of the bulb, so

"that there is free communication between the interior and the vapour jacket, and
·no loss of material. Inside the bulb is a spiral of fine platinum wire, attached to
·stout platinum terminals which are sealed into the glass. These terminals rest in
mercury cups, by means of which connection is made. The temperature of the
liquid in the bulb is raised to the boiling-point by the vapour jacket ; thus when a
current is sent through the wire the whole of the heat developed is spent in
converting a portion of the liquid into vapour.

      If two such bulbs containing difierent liquids are connected in series, the ratio
of their losses of weight is the inverse ratio of the heats of evaporation of the

liquids.

   A correction must be made for the inequality in resistance of the spirals.

The ratio of the differences of potential between the ends of each spiral while the
current is passing is determined in each experiment by PoggendorfT's method.

If the heat of vaporisation of any one liquid be known, the absolute value of

the heat of vaporisation for any other liquid can be calculated from the ratio.

Water was originally selected as the standard liquid, but it proved to be quite

unsuitable : experiments in which one of the liquids was water never gave

concordant results. It appeara impossible by any ordinary means to get water so

pure that conduction across it and the consequent polarisation may be disregarded.

LThe liquid finally adopted as the standard is benzene, for which = 94-4 at 80°-2.i

The heat of evaporation may also be calculated from the thermodynamic

L --equation, = («' «) JP- · _^, when the necessary data can be found.

     The value of J adopted in these calculations is that given by Griffiths - and
used in working out the experiments on benzene. Even if not correct, it is still
the right value to use here, because it was determined by means of the same
standards as those by which the quantity of heat developed in the benzene experi-
ments was determined, so that any errors would eliminate.

     The other data were experimental.

    The agreement between the found and calculated values of L is fairly close in

most of the cases examined. The work is still in progress.

 The following Papers and Reports were read :

1. On the Electrification and Diselectrification of Air and other Gases.
     By Lord Kelvin, Magnus Maclean, and Alexander Galt.

     § 1. Experiments were made for the purpose of finding an approximation to
the amount of electrification communicated to air hj one or more electrified
needle points. The apparatus consisted of a metallic can 48 cm. high and
SI cm. in diameter, supported by paraffine blocks, and connected to one pair of
quadrants of a quadrant electrometer. It had a hole at the top to admit the

electrifying wire, which was 5'81 metres long, hanging vertically within a metallic
guard tube. This guard tube was always metallically connected to the other pair

of quadrants of the electrometer and to its case, and to a metallic screen surround-

ing it. This prevented any external influences from sensibly aflecting the electro-

meter, such as the working of the electric machine which stood on a shelf 5 metres
above it.

   --§ 2. The experiment is conducted as follows : One terminal of an electric

machine is connected with the guard tube and the other with the electrifying wire

which is let down so that the needle is in the centre of the can. The can is
temporarily connected to the case of the electrometer. The electric machine is

then NTorked for some minutes, so as to electrify the air in the can. As soon as

the machine is stopped the electrityin.^ wire is lifted clear out of the can. The

can and the qnadrants in metallic connection with it are disconnected from the

case of the electrometer, and the electrified air is very rapidly drawn away from

the can by a blowpipe bellows arranged to exhaust. This releases the opposite kind

of electricity from the inside of tlie can, and allows it to place itself in equilibrium

on the outside of the can and on the insulated quadrants of the electrometer in

metallic connection with it.

We§ 3.          tried diftercnt lengths of time of electrification, and different numbers

of needles and tinsel, but we found that one needle and four minutes of electrifica-

tion gave nearly maximum effect. The greatest deflection observed was 936 scale

divisions. To find, from this reading, the electric density of the air in the can, we

took a metallic disc, of 2 cm. radius, attached to a long varnished glass rod, and

placed it at a distance of 1'45 cm. from another and larger metallic disc. This

small air condenser was charged from the electric light conductors in the labora-

tory to a difference of potential amounting to 100 volts. The insulated disc thus

charged was removed and laid upon the roof of the large insulated can. This

addition to the metal in connection with it does not sensibly influence its electro-

static capacity. The deflection observed was 122 scale divisions. The capacity

of the condenser is approximately            -^!~--            The quantity of electricity

--with which it was charged was - x ^- = ---- electrostatic unit.        Hence the

The bellows was worked vigorously for two and a half minutes, and in that

time all the electrified air would be exhausted. The capacity of the can was

16,632 cubic centimetres, which gives, for the quantity of electricity per cubic

centimetre, ,,,,,^,,- = 1-06 x 10^''. The electrification of the air in this case was

                  lobd2

positive : it was about as great as the greatest we got, whether positive or
negative, in common air when we electrified it by discharge from needle points.
This is about four times the electric density which we roughly estimated as about
the greatest given to the air in the inside of a large metal vat, electrified by a
needle point and then left to itself, and tested by the potential of a water-dropper
with its nozzle in the centre of th'5 vat, in experiments made two years ago, and
described in a communication to the Royal Society of date May 1894.1

     § 4. In subsequent experiments electrifying common air in a large gas-liolder

over water by an insulated gas flame burning within it with a wire in the interior
of the flame kept electrified by an electric machine to about 6,000 volts, whether

positively or negatively, we found as much as To x 10~' for the electric density

of the air. Electrifying carbonic acid in the same gas-holder, ivhetker positively or

negatively, by needle points, we obtained an electric density of 22 x 10~'.

     § 5. AVe found about the same electric density (2-2 x 10~') of negative
electricity in carbonic acid gas drawn from an iron cylinder lying horizontally, and
.allowed to pass by a U-tube into the gas-holder without bubbling througli the
water. This electrification was due probably not to carbonic acid gas rushing
through the stopcock of the cylinder, but to bubbling from the liquid carbonic acid
in its interior, or to the formation of carbonic acid snow in the passages and its

subsequent evaporation. When carbonic acid gas was drawn slowly from the

liquid carbonic acid in the iron cylinder placed upright, and allowed to pass,
without bubbling, through the (J -tube into the gas-holder over water, no electrifi-
cation was found in the gas unless electricity was communicated to it from needle

points.

     § 6. The electrifications of air and carbonic acid described in Sections 4 and 5

were tested, and their electric densities measured, by drawing by an air pump

to a receiver of known efficiency and of known capacity in connection with the

Weelectrometer.  have not yet measured how much electricity was lost in the

passage through the indianibber tube. It was not probably nothing ; and the

electric density of the gas before leaving the gas-holder was no doubt greater,

though perhaps not much greater, than what it had when it reached the electric

receiver.

     § 7. The efficiency of the electric receivers used was approximately determined
by putting two of them in series, wdth a paraffine tunnel between them, and mea-
suring by means of two quadrant electrometers the quantity of electricity which

each took from a measured quantity of air drawn through them. By performing

this experiment several times, with the order of the two receivers alternately
reversed, we had data for calculating the proportion of the electricity taken by

each receiver from the air entering it, on the assumption that the proportion taken
by each receiver was the same in each case. This assumption was approximately

justified by the results.

     § 8. Thus we found for the efficiencies of two different receivers respectively
077 and 0'31 with air electrified positively or negatively by needle points ; and
082 and 42 with carbonic acid gas electrified negatively by being drawn from an
iron cylinder placed on its side. Each of these receivers consisted of block tin

pipe 4 cm. long and 1 cm. diameter, with five plugs of cotton wool kept in position
by six discs of fine wire gauze. The great diti'erence in their efficiency was, no
doubt, due to the quantities of cotton wool being dill'ereut, ur differently compressed!

in the two.

     § 9. AVe have commenced, and we hope to continue, an investigation of the

efficiency of electric receivers of various kinds, such as block tin, brass, and

platinum tubes from 2 to 4 cm. long and from 1 mm. to 1 cm. internal diameter,

all of smooth bore and without any cotton wool or Avire gauze filters in  them                        alsa
                                                                                                   ;

a polished metal solid insulated withhi a paratfine tunnel. This investigation,

made with various quantities of air drawn through per second have already given

us some interesting and surprising results, which we hope to describe after we

have learned more by further experimenting.

§ 10, In addition to our experiments on electric filters we have made many

other experiments to find other means for tlie diselectrification of air. It might

be supposed that drawing air in bubbles through water should be very effective for

Wethis purpose, but we find that this is far from being the case.  had previously

found that non-electrified air drawn in bubbles through pure water becomes nega-

Wetively electi'ified, and through salt water positively.  now find that positively

electrified air drawn through pure water, and negatively electrified air through

salt water, has its electrification diminished but not annulled if the primitive elec-

trification is sufficiently strong. Negatively electrified air drawn in bubbles through
pure water, and positively electrified air drawn through salt water, has its electri-

fication augmented.

    § 11. To test the effects of heat we drew air through combustion tubes of

HGerman glass about 180 cm. long and 24 or cm. bore, the heat being applied

externally to about 120 cm. of the length. AVe found that wlien the temperature

was raised to nearly a dull red heat, air, whether positively or negatively electrified,

lost little or nothing of its electrification by being drawn through the tube. When

the temperature was raised to a dull red heat, and to a bright red, high enough to
soften the glass, losses up to as much as four-fifths of the whole electrification were
sometimes observed, but never complete diselectrification. The results, however,
were very irregular. Non-electrified air never became sensibly electrified by being
drawn through the hot glass tubes in our experiments ; but it gained strong posi-

of the pump raised the water inside tu a height of 8"! cm., so that the volume of

air drawn througli the receivers in the experiments was 428 cubic cm. per stroke
of the pump. This agrees with the measured efEective volume of the two cylinders.

tive electrification when pieces of copper foil, and negative electrification when
pieces of carbon, were placed in the tube, and when the temperature was sufficient
to powerfully oxidise the copper or to burn away the charcoal.

     § 12. Through the kindness of Mr. E. Matthey, we have been able to experi-
ment with a platinum tube 1 metre lone and 1 mm. bore. It was heated either

by a gas flame or an electric current. When the tube was cold, and non-electri-

iied air drawn through it, we found no signs of electrification by our receiver and
electrometer. But when the tube was made red or white hot, either by gas

burners applied externally or by an electric current through the metal of the tube,
the previously non-electrified air drawn through it was found to be electrified

strongly positive. To get complete command of the temperature we passed a
measured electric current through -0 cm. of the platinum tube. On increasiug the

current x,ill the tube began to be at a scarcely visible dull red heat we found but
little electrification of the air. "When the tube was a little warmer, so as to be

quite visibly red hot, large electrification became manifest. Thus 60 strokes of the
air-pump gave 45 scale divisions on the electrometer when the tube was dull red,
and .395 scale divisions (7 volts) when it was a bright red (produced by a current
of .36 amperes). With stronger currents, raising the tube to white-hot tempera-

ture, the electrification seemed to be considerably less.

2. Bo Vertical (Earth-Air) Electric Currents Exist in the United
               Kingdom ? By A. W. Rucker, F.R.S.

AIn a paper by Dr. Adolph Schmidt read before Section          of the British

Association at Oxford,' the author stated that he had expanded the components of

the earth's magnetic force in series, and had deduced expressions, two of which

give the magnetic potential on the surface of the earth in so far as it depends on

(1) internal and (2) external forces. ' The third series represents that part of the

magnetic forces which cannot be expressed in terms of a potential, but must be

due to electric currents traversing the earth's surface.' The author concludes that

such currents amount ' on the average to about 0"! ampere per square kilometre.'

It appeared, therefore, desirable that this conclusion, drawn from the magnetic

state of the earth as a whole, should be tested by means of those portions which

have been most fully studied.

The test to be applied is whether the line integral of the magnetic force taken

round a re-entrant circuit is or is not a vanishing quantity.

    The irregular form of the United Kingdom makes tlie application of this test
more difficult than it would otherwise be, but as two detailed surveys of Great

Britain and Ireland have been carried out by Dr. Thorpe and myself for the

epochs 1886 and 1891 respectively, the data at our disposal are so numerous that

I thought it worth while to undertake the inqtury. The actual work of calcida-

tion has been carried out almost entirely by two of my students, Messrs. Kay and
AVhalley. My best thanks are due to them for the care and skill they have

displayed.

Two circuits called the a and /3 circuits respectively were selected, bounded by

the following lines :

            (a) Long. 2° W., Lat. 58° N. ; Long. 7° W., Lat. 52° N.
            (/3) Long. 1° W., Lat. 55° N. ; Long. 9° W., Lat. 52° N.

The work done by a unit magnetic pole on traversing these circuits was calculated
for the epoch 18860 by means of the terrestrial lines found for that date, and also
for the epoch 1891-0 by means (1) of the same lines when due allowance was
made for the secular change, and (2) of the independent set of lines found by aid

of the later survey.

     The magnitudes of the hypothetical currents deduced from these calculations

·were very small, and those for the later epoch were of opposite signs, according as
they were calculated from the earlier or the later survey.

     The same calculation -was made for two other circuits, one (y) in Great Britain
and one (S) in Ireland ; but instead of using the calculated terrestrial lines, the
true values of the forces and declinations were employed, as deduced from the
nearest stations. The great local disturbances in Antrim interfered with the value
of the Irish circuit. The following table gives the results in amperes per square
kilometre obtained from circuits a and (3 by the terrestrial lines for 1886-0, and
also by the mean terre.strial lines for 1891'0, which occupy the mean position
between those given by the two independent surveys, and lastly the results for

circuit (-y).

2. The current density. For electrolytic analysis Classen gives a current

density of 0'05 to 1*0 ampere per 100 sq. cm., and S. P. Thompson U'08 to 0'25

Weampere per 100 sq. cm. for steel facing.  find that it is advisable to strike

the deposit with a density of 0'2 ampere per 100 sq. cm., then reduce to 0'15 to

0'18 ampere per 100 sq. cm., and that this should not he exceeded, though

densities as low as O'OS can be used.

The potential ditierence between the terminals we used was 0'7 volt, and this

was obtained by placing a single storage cell, voltage 2, in series with a dilute

sulphuric acid cell with lead electrodes and a small external resistance.

3. The electrodes. The cathode must present a perfectly clean surface. "VVe

used thin copper sheet and found the best method of cleaning was to flush it with

nitric acid and then scrub it with excess of a strong solution of potassium cyanide.

     All parts of the cathode except that on which the deposit is to form must be

insulated from the solution. This may be done by coating the necessary parts

with Briuiswick black, on which, if perfectly dry, the solution has no action.

The anode was a sheet of rolled Swedish iron, and to prevent the impurities it

contained from mixing with the electrolyte it was enclosed in a porous cell. The

accumulation of sulphuric acid in the electrolyte was prevented as much as possible

by changing the solution in this cell twice daily. The solution used contained

one per cent, ferrous chloride. The surface of the cathode is covered with small

conical cavities, due to the formation of microscopic gas bubbles ; in the early stages

of the deposition great care must be taken to remove these by periodically exposing

the surface to the air and in addition rubbing the surface. By taking these pre-

cautions the process can be carried on without interruption, and a firm, coherent

deposit obtained of great purity.

7. On idc Velocity of Light in Rarefied Gases through ivhich an Flectrical
    Discharge is passing, i??/ Edwin Edser, -d.^.C/S*., «W(i Sydney G.

     Starling, A.R.C.S.

Lord Rayleigh has published the result of a research relative to the velocity of

light in an electrolyte through which an electric current is passing. Dilute

sulphuric acid was used, and the conclusion reached was that the velocity was

unaffected by the passage of the current.

It seemed to us worth while to perform a similar experiment to the above, sub-

stituting a rarefied gas for the electrolyte. The conditions are somewhat difi'erent,

for though it has been shown by Professor J. J. Thomson that the ordinary stratified

discharge can be assimilated to a current passing through an electrolyte by con-

sidering each stratification to correspond to a Grotthus chain, yet there is left still

outstanding the phenomenon known as the kathode rays. Professor J. J. Thomson

considers these rays to consist of a number of atoms, each carrying its tubes of

force, and moving with a velocity comparable with 2 x 10'' cm. per second. If

these tubes of force consist of or comprise a number of vortex filaments of the

ether, we might reasonably hope to detect some diSerence in the velocity of the

light, according as it moves with or against this ether current.

The method used by us is essentially that employed by Professor Michelson in

re-performing Fizeau's experiment, two vacuum tubes with plane glass ends being

substituted for the tubes through which in his experiment water was caused to
Aflow.
        discharge was produced in these tubes by a RuhmkorS" coil, and the

interference bands were carefully observed. No alteration could be detected on

the discharge being reversed. The experiment was repeated at various pressures

(determined by the McLeod gauge) with the same result.

   A valid objection which might be raised to the above experiments is, that on

account of the extremely short duration of these discharges, which succeeded each

other only a few times a second, any sliift of the bands would not be capable of
detection by the observer. The most satisfactory results could be obtained by
using a constant current from a battery of a large number of cells ; but as these

were not at our command, we attempted to obtain a prolonp;ed discharge from a

battery of ten one gallon Leyden jars, a piece of wet string being included in the
circuit. The jars were charged by means of the above-mentioned IfuhmkorfF coil,
suitable arrangements being made for the purpose ; and the discharges occasionally
succeeded each other so quickly that for some seconds the phenomena were ap-
parently continuous. The duration of each discharge was determined by means of
Mr. Boys's wheel of lenses, and was found to exceed -^ second. Not the slightest
flicker of the bands could, however, be detected.

   A check experiment was then performed by dropping a piece of plate glass,

which would produce a shift of the bands when placed in the path of the light,

^from such a height that its effect would last second and xJ o second respectively.

In each of these cases a flicker was observed.

' From this we conclude that the kathode rays and the positive column, either

alone or conjointly, do not affect the velocity of light passing along their path.

8. Oil the Hysteresis of Iron in an Alternating Magnetic Field.

                     By Francis G. Baily, M.A.

    The law connecting hysteresis and induction when the latter reaches a high
value has not until now been ascertained. It has hitherto been assumed that the

hysteresis would increase continuously with the induction without limit. It is,

however, probable that in a slowly performed cycle of change of magnetisation a

maximum value of the hysteresis will be reached when the iron is saturated, and

that further increase of the number of lines of force induced will produce no fur-

Whenther increase in the hysteresis.  a rapidly alternating field is considered the

conditions are somewhat ditl'erent. As the magnetising current is increased the

iron reaches its saturation value at an earlier point in each peviod, thus increasiug

the rate of change of magnetisation. But it has been shown bj' different experi-

menters that the value of the hysteresis per cycle is practically unchanged through

wide variations in speed, and hence it may be expected that the hysteresis of iron

under all conditions will arrive at a definite maximum.

     To verify this experimentally, the hysteresis in a small sample of iron was
measured, when it was placed between the poles of a powerful electromagnet ex-

cited by an alternating current. Both magnet and sample were laminated, the

subdivision of the latter being especially fine, in order to eliminate as far as pos-

sible errors due to eddy currents. The sheets consisted of soft charcoal-iron of

thickness 'OOSS cm., and between each was a layer of tissue paper. The maxi-

mum value of the eddy currents was less than 2 per cent, of the h3'steresis. The

hysteresis was measured by the rise in temperature of the iron after 90 seconds,

the speed of alternation being constant at 103 cycles per second. The sides of the

sample were coated with layers of sheet cork, the radiation being very small. At

the end sufficient protection could not be allowed owing to the small size of the

air-gap, and hence transference of heat was prevented by maintaining equality of

temperature between the pole pieces and the sample by means of streams of hot

or cold paraffin oil over the pole pieces. All temperatures were measured by

thermoelectric couples of german silver and copper.

The experiments show that the curve when plotted with the induction as abscissa,

and the hysteresis as ordinate, exhibits a flexure at an induction of about 16,000,

and becomes practically horizontal at 23,000. This corresponds to a value of in-

tensity of magnetisation of 1,640, which is just the saturation value.
    The same characteristics are observed when the intensity of magnetisation is

taken as the abscissa, the curve bending over until it is almost horizontal at the

point of saturation.

The experiments prove that the hysteresis of iron is a function, not of indue-

and that tlie relation between them is not a logarithmic curve, but is a curve
showing one fiexure, anJ clearly indicating in its upper portion the condition of

the iron represented by Professor Swing's third stage of magnetisation.

1. On the Change of Molecular Refraction in Salts or Acids dissolved in
 Water. By Dr. J.H. Gladstone, F.R.S., and Walter Hibbert, F.I.C.

     The authors bad recently undertaken a research on the questions--Does the
specific refractive energy of a salt or acid when deduced from its solution in water
differ from that of the solid compound ? and Does the specific refractive energy
vary according to the amount of water ? The outcome of the experiments of the
authors and others is that the water does bring about in many cases a small altera-
tion, especially in passing from the solid or liquid to the dissolved condition
that this alteration is sometimes an increase, at other times a decrease ; and that
it depends upon the chemical nature of the compound. Some_ points of physical
interest were, however, noted, and were being more fully examined. One of these
is the analogy of this refraction change in several instances with the change in the
power to rotate the plane of polarised light as determined by Dr. Perkin. As this
small change of refraction evidently indicates some rearrangement of the consti-
tuents of the salt or acid in the water, it may throw light upon present theories
of solution. The experiments, even those of Kohlrausch and Hallwachs on ex-
tremely dilute solutions, do not support the view that the binary compound when
greatly diffused tends to exhibit the properties of a gas. There is an evident
relation between this change of refraction and the electric conductivity of the
solution. Thus, in the acids the order of the two phenomena is the same, the
hydrochloric acid showing the greatest effect, rapidly followed by hydrobromic
and hydriodic acids ; then nitric acid, afterwards sulphuric acid ; and at a great
distance acetic and other organic acids. In the case of nitric and sulphuric acids
the general form of the curves representing the change of electric conductivity and

of refraction is similar ; in the case of the latter there is a special depression during

the rise of the conductivity curve which makes its appearance as a slackening of
the rise in the curve representing change of refraction. This connection of the two
phenomena is being further carefully examined at present.

                  By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, F.R.S.

     Professor Silvanus Thompson pointed out that the giving of names was a
detail, and that agreement was wanted upon the units themselves in which mag-

netic quantities were to be expressed. He agreed with the Standards Committee

that the two most important units to be defined were those of magnetic flux and of
magnetic potential, and urged that no other units should be defined until these
had been tried. But he differed from the suggestion to take the weber as 10^
C.G.S. lines as being a unit of too great an order of magnitude to suit practical

needs. He preferred simply to take the line, with its natural multiples the kiloline,

and the megaline as the unit of flux. If the name wther were given to the line
 itself the Committee's recommendation would then be identical, so far as this unit

is concerned, with that of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. He

agreed with the propositions to adopt the name gauss for the O.G.S. unit of mag-

netic potential.

                          Section B.--CHEMISTRY.

 --Peesident oe the Section. Professor R. Melbola, F.E.S., Foe.Sec.C.S,

                          THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12.

     The President delivered the following Address :

                       The State of Chemical Science in 1851.

In order to estimate the progress of chemical science since the year 1851,

when the British Association last met in this town, it will be of interest for us
to endeavour to place ourselves in the position of those who took part in the

Bproceedings of Section on that occasion. Perhaps the best way of performino-

this retrograde feat will be to confront the fundamental doctrines of modern
chemistry with the state of chemical theory at that period, because at any point

--in the history of a science the theoretical conceptions in vogue whether these
--conceptions have survived to the present time or not may be taken as the

abstract summation of the facts, i.e., of the real and tangible knowledge existin"-
at the period chosen as the standard of reference.

    "Without going too far back in time I may remind you that in 1811 the

atomic theory of the cheraists was grafted on to the kindred science of physics
through the enunciation of the law associated with the name of Avoo-adro di
Quaregna. The rationalising of this law had been accomplished in 1845fbut the
kinetic theory of gases, which had been foreshadowed by D. BernouUi in 1738, and
in later times by Herapath, Joule, and Kronig, lay buried in the archives of the
Royal Society until recently unearthed by Lord Rayleigh and given to the world
in 1892 under the authorship of Waterston, the legitimate discoverer. The later
developments of this theory did not take place till after the last Ipswich meeting,
viz., in 1857-1862, by Clausius, and by Clerk Maxwell in 1860-1867. Thus the
kinetic theory of gases of the physicists had not in 1851 acquired the full signi-
ficance for chemists which it now possesses : the hypothesis of Avogadro was
available, analogous conceptions had been advanced by Davy in 1812, and by
Ampere in 1814; but no substantial chemical reasons for its adoption were
adduced until the year 1846, when Laurent published his work on the law of
even numoers of atoms rr.d the nature of the elements in the free state.*

    The so-called ' New Chemistry ' with which students of the present time are

familiar was, in fact, being evolved about the period when the Britisli Association
last assembled at Ipswich ; but it was not till some years later, and then chiefly
through the writings of Laurent and Gerhardt, that' the modern views became

accepted. It is of interest to note in passing that the nomenclature of organic

--compounds formed the subject of a report by Dr. Daubeny at that meetino- in

which he says : ' It has struck me as a matter of surprise that none of the
British treatises on Chemistry with which I am acquainted should contain any

rules to guide us, either in affixing names to substances newly discovered or
                                    ' Ann. CMm. Plujt. [.S]. 18, 206.
640 REPORT-- 1895.

in divining the nature and relations of bodies from the appellations attached to

them. Nor do I find this deficiency supplied in a manner which to me appears
satisfactory when I turn to the writings of Continental chemists.' In a

--subsequent portion of the report Dr. Daubeny adds: ' No name ought, for the

sake of convenience, to exceed in length six or seven syllables.' I am afraid the

requirements of modern organic chemistry have not enabled us to comply with

this condition.

    Among other physical discoveries which have exerted an important influence

on chemical theory the law of Dulong and Petit, indicating the relationship
between specific heat and atomic weight, had been announced in 1819, had been
subsequently extended to compounds by Neumann, and still later had been placed
upon a sure basis by the classical researches of Regnault in 1839. But here,
again, it was not till after 1851 that Cannizzaro (1858) gave this law the im-

portance which it now possesses in connection with the determination of atomic
weights. Thermo-chemistry as a distinct branch of our science may also be

considered to have arisen since 1851, although the foundations were laid before
this period by the work of Favre and Silbermann, Andrews, Graham, and
especially Hess, whose important generalisation was announced in 1840, and
whose claim to just recognition in the history of phj'sical chemistry has been
ably advocated in recent times by Ostwald. But the elaboration of thermo-
chemical facts and views in the light of the dynamical theory of heat was first
commenced in 1853 by Julius Thomsen, and has since been carried on con-
currently with the work of Berthelot in the same field which the latter investi-
gator entered in 1865. Electro-chemistry in 1851 was in an equally rudimentary

condition. Davy had published his electro-chemical theory in 1807, and in 1812
Berzelius h ad put forward those views on electric afiinity which became the basis
of his dualistic system of formulation. In 1833 Faraday announced his famous
law of electro-chemical equivalence, which gave a fatal blow to the conception of
Berzelius, and which later (1839-1840) was made use of by Daniell in order to

show the untenability of the dualistic system. By 1851 the views of Berzelius

bad been abandoned, and, so far as chemical theory is concerned, the M'hole

subject may be considered to have been in abeyance at that time. It is of

interest to note, however, that in that year AVilliamson advanced on quite distinct

grounds his now well-known theory of atomic interchange between molecules,
which theory in a more extended form was developed independently from the
physical side and applied to electrolytes by Clausius in 1867. The modern theory
 of electrolysis associated with the names of Arrhenius, van 't Hoff, and Ostwald
is of comparatively recent growth. It appears that Hittorf in 1878 was the first

 to point out the relationship between electrolytic conductivity and chemical
 activity, this same author as far back as 1856 having combated the prevailing
view that the electric current during electrolysis does the work of overcoming
 the affinities of the ions. Arrhenius formulated his theory of electrolytic disso-
 ciation in 1887, Planck having almost simultaneously arrived at similar views on

other grounds.
      Closely connected with electrolysis is the question of the constitution of solu-

tions, and here again a convergence of work from several distinct fields has led

to the creation of a new branch of physical chemistry which may be considered

 a modern growth. The relationship between the strength of a solution and its
 freezing point had been discovered by Blagden towards the end of the last
 century, but in 1851 chemists had no notion that this observation would have any
 influence on the future development of their science. Another decade elapsed
 before the law was rediscovered by Rlidorft' (1861 ( and ten years later was
 further elaborated by de Coppet. Racult published his first, wonc on the freezing
 point of solutions in 1882, and two years later the relationship between osmotic
pressure and the lowering of freezing point was established by H. de Yries, who

 first approached the subject as a physiologist, through observations on the cell

contents of living plants. As the work done in connection with osmotic pressure

has had such an important influence on the ' dissociation ' theory of solutions, it

will be of Interest to note that at tlie last Ipswich meeting Thomas Graham made
                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B,                                                 641

a communicatiou on liquid diffusion, in which he ' gave a view of some of the
unpublished results, to ascertain whether solutions of saline bodies hpd a power
of diffusion among liquids, especially water.' In 1877 Pfeffer, who, like de Vries,
entered the field from the botanical physiological side, succeeded in effecting the
measui'ement of osmotic pressure. Ten years later van 't Hoff formulated the
modern dissociation theory of solution by applying to dissolved substances the
laws of Boyle, Gay-Lussae, and Avogadro, the law of osmotic pressure, and
Raoult's law connecting the depression of freezing point with molecular weight,
thus laying the foundation of a doctrine which, whether destined to survive in
its present form or not, has certainly exerted a great inffuence on contemporary

chemical thought.
     Consider, further, the state of knowledge in 1851 concerning such leading prin-

ciples as dissociation or thermolysis, mass action, and chemical equilibrium.
Abnormal vapour densities had been observed by Avogadro in 1811, and hy
Ampere in 1814. Grove had dissociated water vapour by heat in 1847, but the
first great advance was made ten years later by Saiute-Claire Deville, from whoso

work has emanated our existing knowledge of this subject. I may add that the
application of this principle to explain the cases of abnormal vapour density was

made in 1858 by Kopp, Kekule, and Cannizzaro almost simultaneously ; but,

strangely enough, this explanation was not accepted by Deville himself. The

subsequent stages are subjects of modern history The current views on mass

action were foreshadowed, as is well known, by Berthollet in his ' Statique

Chimique,' published in 1803, but no great advance bad been made when the

British Association last met here. The subject first began to assume a quanti-

tative aspect through the researches of Bunsen and Debus in 1853, and was

much advanced by Gladstone in 1865, and by Harcourt and Esson a year later.

Guldberg and Waage published their classical work on this subject in 18G7.

Equally striking will appear the advances made since 1851 if we consider

that the whole subject of spectrum analysis, which brings our science into rela-

tionship with astronomy, has been called into existence since that date. The cele-

brated work of Bunsen and KircbhofF was not published till 1859. Neither can

I refrain from reminding you that the coal-tar colour industry, with which I

have been to a small extent connected, was started into activity by Perkin's dis-

covery  of  mauve  in  1856                       the  reaction  of  this  industry  on  the  development  of
                                               ;

organic chemistry is now too well known to require further mention. In that

direction also which brings chemistry into relationship with biology the progress
has been so great that it is not going beyond the fact to state that a new science
has been created. Pasteur began his studies on fermentation in 1857, and out
of that work has arisen the science of bacteriology, with its multifarious and far-

reaching consequences. As this chapter of chemical history forms the subject

of one of the evening discourses at the present meeting, it is unnecessary to dwell

further upon it now. One other generalisation may be chronicled among the

great developments achieved since 1851, I refer to the periodic law connecting
the atomic weights of the chemical elements with their physical and chemical

properties. Attempts to establish numerical relationships in the case of isolated
groups of elements had been made by Dobereiner in 1817, by Gmelin in 1826,
and again by Dobereiner in 1829. The triad system of grouping was further

developed by Dumas in 1851. I am informed by Dr. Gladstone that at the last
Ipswich meeting Dumas' speculations in this direction excited much interest.

All the later steps of importance have, however, been made since that time, viz.,
by de Chancourtois in 1862, the 'law of octaves' by Newlands in 1864, the
periodic law by Mendeleelf, and almost contemporaneously by Lothar Meyer in

1869.

     I have been tempted into giving this necessarily fragmentary and possibly

tedious historical sketch because it is approaching half a century since the British

Association visited this town, and the opportunity seemed favourable for going
through that process which in commercial afi'airs is called 'taking stock.' The

result speaks for itself. Our students of the present time who are nourished
intellectually by these doctrines should be made to realise how rapid has been

their development. The pioneers of our science on whose shoulders we stand

--and many of whom are happily still among us will derive satisfaction from the

retrospect, and will admit that their labours have borne goodly fruit. It is not,
however, simply for the purpose of recording this enormous progress that I have

ventured to assume the office of stock-taker. The year 1851 may be regarded as
occurring towards the close of one epoch and the dawn of a new era in cheniical

history. Consider broadly the state of organic chemistry at that time. There is
no occasion for going into detail, even if time admitted, hecause our literature has
recently been enriched by the concise and excellent historical works of Schor-
lemmer and of Ernst von Meyer. It will sulhce to mention that the work and
writings of Liehig, Berzelius, Wohler, Dumas, Gay-Lussac, Bunsen, and others
had given us the leading ideas of isomerism, substitution, compound radicles, and

types. Wurtz and Hofmann had just discovered the organic ammonias William-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

son that same year made known his celebrated work on the ethers ; and Gerhardt
discovered the acid anhydrides a year later. The newer theory of types was
 undergoing development by Gerhardt and his followers ; the mature results were
published in the fourth volume of the ' Traiti? de Chiniie ' in 1856. In this country
the theory was much advanced by the writings of Odling and Williamson.

Subsequent Development oe Chemistry along Two Lines.

The new era which was dawning upon us in 1851 was that of structural or

constitutional chemistry, based on the doctrine of the valency of the atoms. It is

well known that this conception was broached by Frankland in 1852, as the result

of his investigations on the organo-metallic compounds. But it was not till 1858
that Kekul^, who had previously done much to develop the theory of types, and

Couper, almost simultaneously, recognised the quadrivalent character of carbon.

To attempt to give anything approaching an adequate notion of the subsequent

influence of this idea on the progress of organic chemistry would be tantamount to

reviewing the present condition of that subject. I imagine that no conception

more proliBc of results has ever been introduced into any department of science. If

we glance back along the stream it will he seen that shortly after the last meeting

here the course of discovery began to concentrate itself into two channels. In one

we now find the results of the confluent labours of those who have regarded our

science from its phy.sical side. In the other channel is flowing the tide of discovery

arising from the valency doctrine and its extension to the structure of chemical

molecules. The two channels are at present fairly parallel and not far apart ; an
occasional explorer endeavours now and again to make a cross-cut so as to put the

streams into communication. The currents in both are running very rapidly, and

the worker who has embarked on one or the other finds himself hurried along at

such a pace that there is hardly breathing time to step ashore and see what his

neighbours are doing. It speaks well for the fertility of the conception of valency

-- --that the current in this channel is flowing with unabated vigour, although its

catchment area to pm-sue the metaphor is by no means so extensive as that of

the neighbouring stream.

    The modem tendency to specialisation, which is a necessity arising from the

large number of workers and the rapid multiplication of results, is apparently in

Wethe two directions indicated.  have one class of workers dealing with the

physics of matter in relation to general chemical properties, and another class of

--investigators concerning themselves with the special properties of individual com-

pounds and classes of compounds with atomic idiosyncrasies. The workers of

one class are diflerentiating while their colleagues are integrating. It would he

nothing less than unscientific to institute a comparison between the relative merits

of the two methods ; both are necessary for the development of our science. All

methods of attacking the unknown are equally welcomed. In some cases physical

methods are available, in other cases purely chemical methods have alone been found

of use. There is no antagonism, but co-operation. If the results of the two methods

are sometimes at variance it is simply because we have not known how to interpret

them. The physical chemist has adopted the results of the application of chemical

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I

methods of determining ' constitution/ and is endeavouring: to furnish us with new
weapons for attaclfiiig this same problem. The chemist who is seeking to unravel

the architecture of molecules is dependent at the outset upon physical methods of
determining the relative weights of his molecules. The worker who is bringing
about new atomic groupings is furnishing material for the farther development of

generalisations from which new methods applicable to the problem of chemical
structure may again be evolved. The physical chemist sometimes from the broad-

ness of his view is apt to overlook or to minimise the importance of chemical

individuality. On the other hand the chemist who is studying the numberless
potentialities of combination resident in the atoms, and who has grasped to the full

extent their marvellous individualities, is equally liable to forget that there are
connecting relationships as well as specific dltferences in the properties of elements

--and compounds. These are but the mental traits the unconscious bias engendered

by the necessary specialisation of work to which I have referred, and which is

observable in every department of scientific labour.

The Peesext State of Structiteal Chemistry.

The success attending the application of the doctrine of valency to the com-

pounds of carbon has helped its extension to all compounds formed by other

elements, and the student of the present day is taught to use structural formulre as

A Bthe of his science. It is, I think, generally recognised among chemists that

this doctrine in its present state is empirical, but it does not appear to me that this

point is sulliciently insisted upon in chemical teaching. I do not mean to assert

that for the last thirty years chemists have been pursuing  a  phantom                                              neither  do
                                                                                                                 ;

I think that we should be justified in applying to this doctrine the words applied
to its forerunner, the ' types ' of Gerhardt, by Lothar Meyer, who says that these

^have rendered great service in the development of the science, but they can only

be regarded as a part of the scafi'olding which was removed when the erection of

the system of organic chemistry had made suificient progress to be able to dispense

wdth'it.' ' It appears to me, on the contrary, that there is a physical reality under-

lying the conception of valency, if for no other reason because of the con form-

ability of this property of the atoms to the periodic law. But the doctrine as it

stands is empirical in so far that it is only representative and not explanatory.

Frankland and Kekule have given us a great truth, but its very success is now

making it more and more obvious that it is a truth which is pressing for further

development from the physical side. If we are asked why CO exists, and why

CH,, and CCl, do not, together with innumerable similar questions which the in-

quisitive mind will raise, we get no light from this doctrine. If any over-sanguine

disciple goes so far as to assert that all the possible compounds of the elements indi-

cated by their valency are capable of existence, and will sooner or later be prepared,

he will, I imagine, find himself rapidly travelling away from the region of fact.

There is something to be reckoned with besides valency. The one great desi-

deratum of modern chemistry is unquestionably a physical or mechanical interpre-

tation of the combining capacities of the atoms. Attempts at the construction of

such theories have been made, but thus far only in a tentative way, and these

views cannot be said to have yet come within the domain of practical chemical

politics. I have in mind, among other suggestions, the dj'uamical theory of van

't Hoff published in 1881,'- the theory of electric charges on the atoms broached

by Johnstone Stoney in 1874, and so ably advocated by the late Professor v.

Helmholtz in his Faraday lecture in 1881, and the electric polar theory of Victor

Meyer and Riecke, published in 1888.^

Pending the rationalisation of the doctrine of valency its promulgation must

continue in its present form. Its services in the construction of rational formuhe,

especially within the limits of isomerism, have been incalculable. It is the ladder

by which we have climbed to the present brilliant achievements in chemical

synthesis, and we are not in a position to perform the ungracious task of kicking it

away. In recalling attention to its weaknesses I am only putting myself in the

position of the physician who diagnoses his patient's case with the ulterior object

of getting him stiengthened. There can be no doubt that renewed vitality has

been given to the doctrine by the conceptions of tautomerism and desmotropy,

formulated by Conrad Laar in 1885, and by Paul Jacobson in 1887. The import-

ance of these ideas is becoming more evident with the advancement of chemical

discovery. Any attempt to break down the rigidly statical conception of our

structural formulae appears to me to be a step in the right direction. Then, again,

I will remind you of the prolific development of the doctrine in the hands of Le Bel

--and van't HoU by the introduction of the stereochemical hypothesis in 1874 un-

questionably the greatest advance in structural chemistry since the recognition of the

quadrivalent character of the carbon atom. If evidence be required that there i»

a physical reality underlying the conception of valency, we need only point to the

close accordance of this notion of the asymmetric carbon atom with the facts of

so-called ' physical isomerism ' and the splendid results that have followed from its

introduction into our science, especially in the field of the carbohydrates through

the investigations of Emil Fischer and his pupils. In other directions the stereo-

chemical hypothesis has proved to be a most suggestive guide. It was applied by

Professor v. Baeyer in 1885 ^ to explain the conditions of stability or instability of

certain atomic groupings, such as the explosiveness of polyacetylene compounds

and the stability of penta- and hexa-cyclic systems. Again, in 1888 this eminent

chemist showed its fertility in a series of brilliant researches upon benzene deriva-

tives.* Nor can I omit to mention the great impetus given in this field by the

classical work of Wislicenus, who in 1887 applied the hypothesis to unsaturated

compounds and to cyclic systems with remarkable success.^ Quite recently Victor

Meyer and J. Sudborough have shown that the ability of certain derivatives of

benzoic and naphthoic acids to form ethers is governed by stereochemical consider-

ations.'' But I must avoid the temptation to enlarge upon this theme because the

whole subject has been recently brought together by C. A. Bischofl" in his ' Hand-

buch der Stereochemie ' (Frankfurt, 1893-94), a work to which all who are

interested in the subject will naturally turn for reference.

    While the present advanced state of structural chemistry may thus be looked

upon as the outcome of the conceptions of Frankland and Kekul6, it may be well

to bear in mind that the idea of structure is not necessarily bound up with the

hypothesis of valency in its present form. Indeed, some advance had been made

in representing ' constitution,' especially by Kolbe, before the formal introduction

of this hypothesis. The two ideas have grown up together, but the experimental

evidence that in any molecule the atoms are grouped togetiaer in a particular way

is really independent of any theory of valency. It is only after this evidence has

been acquired, either by analysis or synthesis, that we proceed to apply the hypo-

thesis in building up the structural formula. It is of course legitimate to assume

the truth of the hypothesis, and to endeavour by its use to convert an empirical

into a rational  formula                                                                                          but        this  method generally gives     us  a  choice of  formulae
                                                       ;

from which the true one can only be selected by further experimental investigation.

Even within the narrower limits of isomerism it is by no means certain that all the

modifications of a compound indicated by hypothesis are actually capable of exist-

ence. There is, for example, evidence that some of the ' position isomerides ' among-

the derivatives of mono- and poly cyclic compounds are too unstable to exist ; a fact
which in itself is sufficient to indicate the necessity for a revision and extension of

our notions of valency. Thus, by way of illustration, there is nothing in the
hypothesis to indicate why orthoquinones of the benzene series should not be

capable of existence                                                                                              yet it is  a  fact that  in  spite  of all  efforts  such  compounds

have never been obtained. The conditions essential for the existence of these com-
pounds appear to be that the hydrogen of the benzene ring should be replaced by
acid substituents such as oxygen, hydroxyl, chlorine, or bromine. Under these cir-

cumstances, as Zincke has shown,' tetrachlor and tetrabrom-orthobenzoquinone are
stable compounds. So also the interesting researches of Nietzki have proved that
in such a compound as rhodizonic acid ^ orthoquinone oxj'gen atoms are present.
But there is nothing in the doctrine of valency which leads us to suspect that these
orthoquinone derivatives can exist while their parent compound resists all

attempts at isolation. I am aware that it is dangerous to argue from negative

evidence, and it would be rash to assert that these orthoquiuones will never be

obtained. But even in the present state of knowledge it may be distinctly affirmed

that the methods which readily furnish an orthoquinone of naphthalene completely

fail in the case of benzene, and it is just on such points as this that the inadequacy

of the hypothesis becomes apparent. In other words, the doctrine fails in the fun-
damental requirement of a scientific theory ; in its present form it gives us no

--power of prevision it hints at possibilities of atomic groupings, but it does not tell

us a priori which of these groupings are likely to be stable and which unstable. I

am not without hope that the next great advance in the required direction may

yet come from the stereochemical extension of the hypothesis, although the
attempts which have hitherto been made to supply its deficiencies cannot but be

regarded as more or less tentative.

                    The New Theoet of Absteaci Types.

     I will venture, in the next place, to direct attention to a modern development
·of structural chemistry which will help to illustrate still further some of the points

raised. For many years we have been in the habit of abstracting from our struc-
tural formultfi certain ideal complexes of atoms which we consider to represent the
nucleus or type from which the compound of known constitution is derived. In
other words the hypothesis of valency which was developed originally from Ger-
hardt's types is now leading us back to another theory of types based upon a more

intimate knowledge of atomic grouping within the molecule. In some cases these

types have been shown to be capable of existence ; in others they are still ideal.
Used in this way the doctrine of valency is most suggestive, but at the same time
its lack of prevision is constantly forciug itself upon the attention of chemical
investigators. The parent compound has sometimes been known before its deriva-
tives, as in the case of ammonia, which was known long before the organic amines
and amides. In other instances the derivatives were obtained before the type was
isolated, as in the case of the hydrazines, which were characterised by Emil
Fischer in 1875, and the hydrazo-compounds, which have been known since 1863,
 while hydrazine itself was first obtained by Curtius in 1887. Phenylazimide was
 discovered by Griess in 18G4, and many representatives of this group have been
 since prepared ; but the parent compound, bydrazoic acid, was only isolated by
 Curtius in 1890. Derivatives of triazole and tetrazole were obtained by Bladin in
 1885 ; the types were isolated by this chemist and by Andreocci in 1892. Pyr-
 azole derivatives were prepared by Knorr in 1883 pyrazole itself was not isolated

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

 till 1889, by Buchner. Alkyl nitramides were discovered by Franchimont and
 Klobbie many years before the typical compound, nitramide, NOo.NH.,, which
 was isolated last year by Thiele and Lachmau.* Examples might be multiplied

 to a formidable extent, but enough have been given to illustrate the principle
 of the erection of types, which were at first imaginary, but which have since
 become real. The utility of the hypothesis is undeniable in these cases, and

 we are justified in pushing it to its extreme limits. But no chemist, even if
 endowed with prophetic instinct, could have certainly foretold six years ago that

 the type of Griess' ' triazobenzene ' would be capable of free existence, and still
 less that when obtained it would prove to be a strong acid. The fact, established

ty Curtlus, that the group V,!!>N- functions in chemical molecules like the atom

ol chlorine is certainly among the most striking of recent discoveries. Only last

year the list of nitrogen compounds was enriched by the addition of COCNjjj, the

nitrogen analogue of phosgene.^

These illustratiojis, drawn from the compounds of nitrogen, will serve to bring

out the wonderful development which our knowledge of the chemistry of this

element has undergone within the last few years. I might be tempted here into a

digression on the general bearing of the very striking fact that an element com-

paratively inactive in the free state should be so remarkably active in combination,
but I must keep to the main topic, as by means of these compounds it is possible

to ilhistrate still further both the strength and the weakness of our modern con-

ceptions of chemical structure. Consider some of the undiscovered compounds

which are foreshadowed by the process of ideal abstraction of types. The azoxy-

   contain            the

HN-NII HN = NH
\ / or ··
                      . The first of these formulae represents the unknown

dihydro-nitrous oxide. The azo-compounds are derivatives of the hypothetical

diimide HN:NH. An attempt to prepare this compound from azodicarbonic

acid" resulted in the formation of hydrazine. The diethyl-derivative may

have been obtained by Harries,^ but this is doubtful. It is at present inex-

N Nplicable why compounds in which the group · : · is in combination with

aromatic radicles should be so remarkably stable, while the parent compound
appears to be incapable of existence. The addition of two atoms of hydrogen

converts this type again into a stable compound. There is nothing in the

structural fornnil.ie to indicate these facts. The amidines are stable compounds,

and the so-called ' anhydro-bases,' or imidazoles, are remarkably stable ; the

parent compound, HC-^^tt , has not been obtained, while its amido-derivative,

   NTT
HjN.C <^-vT-TT , is the well-known substance guanidine. The isodiazo-compounds

recently discovered by Schraube and Schmidt and by Bamberger'* are pos-

sibly derivatives of the hypothetical substance OrN.NH.,, which might be

Whynamed nitrosamide.          this compound should not exist as well as nitramide

zines were formerly regarded as derivatives of the compounds C0<' · and

CS-^ · .5 Although this structure has now been disproved the possible existence

f'f the types has been suggested. Carbizine and thiocarbizine differ from urea and
thiocarbamide only by two atoms of hydrogen. These types have not been isolated

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

if they are incapable of existence the current views of molecular structure give no

suggestion of a reason. The diazoamides are derivatives of the hypothetical

HoN.NPI.NITj or HN:N.NH,,, compounds which Curtius speaks of as the propane
and propylene of the nitrogen series. The latter complex was at one time thought

to exist in diazohippuramide,*' and a biacidyl derivative of the former type has also
been obtained.'' Both these types await isolation if they are capable of existence.

I may add that several attempts to convert diazoamides into dihydro-derivatives
by mild alkaline reduction have led me to doubt whether this nitrogen chain, can

   Both these types are at present imaginary; whether it is possible for cyclic

   --nitrogen systems to exist we have no means of knowing all that can be said is

   that they have never yet been obtained. It is possible, as I pointed out in 1890

   at the Leeds meeting of the British Association, that mixed diazoamides may be

   derivatives of such a 4-atom ring.

   Any chemist who has followed the later developments of the chemistry of

   Anitrogen could supply numerous other instances of undiscovered types.                                                                                                      chapter

   on the imknown compounds of this element would furnish quite an exciting addi-

   tion to many of those books which are turned out at the present time in such

   profusion to meet the requirements of this or that examining body. I have

   selected my examples from these compounds simply because I can claim some of

   them as personal acquaintances. It would be easy to make use of carbon com-

   pounds lor the same purpose, but it is unnecessary to multiply details. It has

   frequently happened in the history of science that a well-considered statement of

   mythe shortcomings of a theory has led to its much-desired extension. This is

   hope in venturing to point out one of the chief deficiencies in the structural

   chemistry of the present time. I am afraid that I have handled the case badly,
   but I am bound to confess that I am influenced by the same feelings as those

   which prevent us from judging an old and well-tried friend too severely.

   The theory of types to which we have reverted as the outcome of the study of

NHof fcrmulse corresponding to the above, in which  had been substituted for 0,

and aslied whether they did not indicate the existence of a whole series of unknown

hydrogen compounds of nitrog-en, we should probably tell him that his notions of

chemical structure had run wild. At the same time I am bound to admit that it

would be very difficult, if not impossible, to furnish him with satisfactory reasons

for believing that such groupings are improbable. Compare again the series:

The first is urea; the second, third, fourth, fifth (methylene diamine), and sixth
are unknown ; the seventh is the remarkably interesting diazomethane discovered
last year by H. v. Pechmann.^ The last compound, dinitroinethane, is known
in the form of its salts, but appears to be incapable of existence in the free
state. There is nothing expressed or implied in the existinij- theory of chemical
structure to explain why diuitromethane is unstable while trinitromethane is
stable, and mono- and tetranitromethane so stable as to admit of being distilled
without decomposition. Cliemists will form their own views as to the possibility
or impossibility of such a series as this being completed. Whether there would be
a concordance of opinion I will not venture to say ; but any chemist who expressed
either belief or disbelief with regard to any special member would, I imagine, have
great difficulty in giving a scientific reason for tlie faith which is in him. At the
most, he would have only the very unsafe guide of analogy to fall back upon.
Perhaps by the time the British Association holds its next meeting at Ipswich it
will have become possible to prove that one particular configuration of certain
atoms is possible and another configuration impossible. Then will have been

--achieved that great advance for which we are waiting the reunion of the two

streams into which our science began to diverge shortly after the last Ipswich

meeting.

     The present position of structural chemistry maj' be summed up in the state-
ment that we have gained an enormous insight into the anatomy of molecules,

while our knowledge of their physiology is as yet in a rudimentary condition. In
the course of the Ibregoing remarks I have endeavoured to indicate the direction
in which our theoretical conceptions are most urgently pressing for extension. It
is, perhaps, as yet premature to prouoimce an opinion as to whether the next de-
velopment is to be looked for from the stereochemical side ; but it is not going too
far to express once ag«iu the hope that the geometrical representation of valency
will give us a deeper insight into the conditions which determine the stability of
atomic configurations. The speculations of A. v. Baeyer, \^'islicenus, Victor
Meyer, "Wunderlich, Bischoft", and others have certainly turned the attention of

chemists towards a quarter from which a new light may eventually dawn.

                      The Pkogeess of Synthetical Chemistrt.

    If, in my earnest desire to see the foundations of structural chemistry made
more secuie, I may have unwittingly given rise to the impression that 1 am de-
preciating its services as a scientific weapon, let me at once hasten to make amends

by directing attention to the greatest of its triumphs, the synthesis of natural pro-
ducts, i.e., of compounds which are known to be produced by the vital processes of
animals and plants.

     Having been unable to find any recent list of the natural compounds which
have been synthesised, I have compiled a set of tables which will, I hope, see the

                                                                 ' Ber., 27, 1888.

 light at no very distant period. According to this census we have now realised

 about 180 such syntheses. The products of Bacteria have been included in the
 list because these compounds are the results of vital activity in the same sense that

 alcohol is a product of the vital activity of the yeast plant. On the other hand

  the various iiro-cooipounds resulting from the transformation in the animal
 economy of detiiiite chemical substances administered for experimental purposes

 have been excluded, because I am confining my attention to natural products. Of

 course the importance of tracing the action of the living organism on compounds
 of known constitution from the physiological point of view cannot be overesti-
 mated. Such experiments will, without doubt, in time shed much li^ht on the
  working of the vital laboratory.

       TJie history of chemical synthesis has been so thoroughly dealt with from time

 to time that I should not have ventured to obtrude any further notice of this sub-

 ject upon your patience were it not for a certain point which appeared to me of

 siitHcient interest to merit reconsideration. It is generally stated that the forma-

 tion of urea from ammonium cyanate by Wohler in 18i^8 was the tirst synthesis of

 an organic compound. There can be no doubt that this discovery, which attracted
 much attention at the time, gave a serious blow to the current conceptions of

 organic chemistry, because urea was so obviously a product of the living animal.

 It will be found, however, that about the same "time Henry Hennell, of Apothe-
 caries' Hall, had really effected the synthesis of alcohol-- that is to sav, had

 synthesised this compound in the same' sense that Wobler had synthesised urea.
 The history is soon told. In 1826 Hennell (through Brande) communicated a
 paper to the Royal Society which appears in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for

 that year.' In studying the compounds produced by the action of sulphuric
acid on alcohol, and known as ' oil of wine,' he obtained sulphovinic acid,
 which had long been known, and gave fairly good analyses of this acid and of
 someof its salts, while expressing in the same paper very clear notions as to its
 chemical nature. Having satisfied himself that sulphovinic acid is a product of
 the action in question, he then proceeded to examine some sulphuric acid which
 had absorbed eighty times its volume of olefiant gas, and which had been placed
at his disposal for this purpose by Michael Faraday. From this he also isolated
 sulphovinic acid. In another paper, communicated to the Koyal Society in 1828,-
he proves quantitatively that when sulphovinic acid is distilled with sulphuric acid
 and water the whole of the alcohol and sulphuric acid which united to form the
sulphovinic acid are recovered. In the same paper he sliows that he had very
clear views as to the process of etherification. Hennell's work appears to have

been somewhat dimmed by the brilliancy of his contemporaries who were labour-
ing in the same field : but it is not too much to claim for him, after the lapse of
nearly seventy years, the position of one of the pioneers of chemical sj'n thesis. Of
course in his time the synthesis was not complete, because he did not start from
inorganic materials. The olefiant gas used by Faraday had been obtained from
eoal-gas or oil-gas. Moreover, in 1826-1828 alcohol was not generally regarded
as a product of vital activity, and this is, no doubt, the reason why the discovery
failed to produce the same excitement as the formation of urea. But the synthesis

of alcohol from ethylene had, nevertheless, been accomplished, and this hydrocarbon

occupied at that time precisely the same position as ammonium cyanate. The

latter salt had not then been synthesised from inorganic materials, and the forma-
tion of urea, as Schorlemmer points out,' was also not a complete synthesis. The
reputation of Wohler, the illustrious friend and colleague of the raore illustrious
Liebig, will lose not a fraction of its brilliancy by the raising of this historical
question. Science recognises no distinction of nationality, and the future historian

of synthetical chemistry will not begrudge the small niche in the temple of Fame

to which Hennell is entitled.

650 REPORT-- 1895.

Like many other great discoveries iu science, the artificial formation of natural

products began, as in the case of alcohol and urea, with observations arising from

experiments not pi-imarily du'ected to this end. It was not till the theory of

chemical structure had risen to the rank of a scientific guide that the more com-

Weplicated syntheses were rendered possible by more exact methods.  justly

credit structural chemistry with these triumphant achievements. In arriving at
such results any defects in the theory of structure are put out of consideration

--because--and this point must never be lost sight of all doubt as to the possibility

of this or that atomic grouping being stable is set aside at the outset by the actual

occurrence of the compound in nature. The investigator starts with the best of
all assurances. From the time of Wohler and Ilennell the course of discovery in
this field has gone steadily on. The announcement of a new synthesis has ceased
to produce that excitement which it did in the early days when the so-called
' organic ' compounds were regarded as products of a special vital force. The in-
terest among the uninitiated now rises in proportion to the technical value of the
compound. The present list of 180 odd synthetical products comprises, among the

latest discoveries, gentisin, the colouring-matter of the gentian root {Gejrtiana

lutea), which has been prepared by Kostanecki and Tambor, and cafleine, synthe-
sised by Emil Fischer and liorenz Ach, starting from dimethylurea and malonic

acid.

     I have allowed myself no time for those prophetic flights of the imagination

which writers on this subject generally indulge iu. When we know more about

the structure of highly complex molecules, such as starch and albumin, we shall
probably be able to synthesise these compounds. It seems to me more important

just at present to come to an understanding as to what is meant by an organic
synthesis. There appears to be an impression among many chemists that a syn-
thesis is onl}' effected when a compound is built up from simpler molecides. If

the simpler molecules can be formed directly from their elements, then the syn-

thesis is considered to be complete. Thus urea is a complete synthetical product,

because we can make hydrogen cyanide from its elements : from this we can
prepare a cyanate, and finally urea. In dictionaries and text-books we find syn-

thetical processes generally separated from modes of formation, and the latter in

their turn kept distinct from methods of preparation. Tlie distinction between

formation and preparation is obviously a good one, because the latter has a

practical significance for the investigator. But the experience gained iu drawing

up the tables of synthesised compounds, to which I have referred, has resulted in

the conclusion that the terms ' synthesis ' and ' mode of formation ' have been

either unnecessarily confused or kept distinct without sufficient reason, and that it

is impossible now to draw a hard-and-fast line between them. Some recent

writers, such, for example, as Dr. Karl Elbs, iu his admirable work on this subject,'

have expanded the meaning of the word synthesis so as to comprise generally the

building up of organic molecules by the combination of carbon with carbon, with-

out reference to the circumstance whether the compound occiu's as a natural pro-

duct or not. But although this definition is sufficiently wide to cover the whole

field of the production of carbon compounds from less complex molecules, it is in
some respects too restricted, because it excludes such well-known cases as the for-
mation of hydrogen cj'anide from its elements, or of urea from ammonium cyanate.

1 should not consider the discussion of a mere question of terminology of sufficient

importance to occupy the attention of this Section were it not for a matter of

principle, and that a principle of the very greatest importance, which I believe to be

associated with a clear conception of chemical synthesis. The great interest of all
work in this field arises from our being able, by laboratory processes, to obtain

--compounds which are also manufactured in nature's laboratory the living

organism. It is in this direction that our science encroaches upon biology through

physiology. Now, if we confine the notion of synthesis to the building up of

molecules from simpler molecules or from atoms, we exclude one of nature's

methods of producing many of these very compounds which we claim to have

synthesised. There can he no manner of doubt that a large proportion, if not a

majority, of the natural products which have been prepared artificially are not

synthesised by the animal or plant in the sense of building up at all. They are

-- --the results of the breaking down of the degradation of complex molecules into

simpler ones. I urge, therefore, that if in the laboratory we can arrive at one of

these products by decomposing a more complex molecule by means of suitable

reagents, we have a perfect right to call this a synthesis, provided always that the

more complex molecule, which gives us our compound, can be in its turn synthe-

sised, by no matter how many steps, from its constituent atoms. Thus oxalic acid

has been directly synthesised from carbon dioxide by Kolbe and Drechsel by pass-

ing this gas over potassium or sodium amalgam heated to 360°. Whether the

plant makes oxalic  acid                                           directly  out of  carbon dioxide  we cannot at  present state
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

if it does it certainly does not employ Kolbe and Breschel's process. On the other

hand this acid may, for all that is known, exist in the plant as a product of degra-

dation. Many more complex acids, such as citric and tartaric, break down into

oxalic acid when fused with potash. Both citric and tartaric acids can now be

completely synthesised ; therefore the formation of oxalic acid from these by potash

fusion is a true synthesis.

The illustration given will make clear the point which I am urging. The dis-

tinction between a synthesis and a mode of formation vanishes when we can obtain

a compound by the breaking down of a more complex molecule in all those cases

where the latter can be completely built up. If we do not expand the meaning of

synthesis so as to comprise such cases we are simply shutting the door in Nature's

face. It must be borne in mind that the actual yield of the compound furnished

by the laboratory process does not come into consideration, because it may be

generally asserted that in most cases the artificial processes are not the same as

those which go on in the animal or plant. The information of renl value to the

physiologist which these syntheses give is the sugtrestion ihat such or such a

compound may possibly result from the degradation of this or that antecedent

compound, and not from a process of building up from simpler molecules.

        The Beaeing of Chemical Synthesis on Vital Chemistet.

-- --With these views the outcome of structural chemistry the chemist and

physiologist may join hands and move fearlessly onwards towards the great

mystery of vital chemistry. In considering the results of organic synthesis two

Howquestions always arise as it were spontaneously :                                                 does nature produce these

complicated molecules without the use of strong reagents and at ordinary temper-

atures? What bearing have our laboratory achievements on the mechanism of

vitality ? The light shed upon these questions by experimental investigation has

Weas yet flickered only in fitful gleams.                                            are but dwellers in the outer gates,

waiting for the guide who is to show us the bearing of modern research on the

great problem which confronts alike the physicist, the chemist, and the biologist.

The chemical processes that go on in the li\ing organism are complex to an extent

that is difficult to realise. Of the various compounds of animal or vegetable origin

that have been produced synthetically some are of the nature of waste products,

resulting from metabolic degradation ; others are the result of zymolytic action

within  the  organism                                              and  others, again, are  secondary products arising from  the
                                                                ;

action of associated Bacteria, the relationship between the Bacteria and their host

being as yet imperfectly understood. The answer to the question how nature

produces complicated organic molecules will be much facilitated when the

physiologist, by experiment and observation, shall have made possible a sound

classification of these synthetical products based on their mode of origination in

the organism.

The enlargement of the definition of organic synthesis which I have advocated

has been rendered necessary by the consideration of certain questions which have

arisen in connection with the present condition of chemical discovery in this field.

What evidence is there that any one of the 180 compounds which have been pre-
652 REPORT-- 1895.

pared artificially is produced in the organism ty .1 direct process of building up ?

Is not the opposite view quite as probable ? May they not, from the simplest to

--the most complex, be products of the degradation of still more complex molecules ?

I venture to suggest not without some temerity lest our colleagues of Sections I

K --and should treat me as an intruder that this view should be given a fair trial.

1 am aware that the opposite view, especially as regards plant assimilation, has

long been held, and especially since 1870, when v. Baeyer advanced his celebrated

theory of the formic aldehyde origin of carbohydrates. It is but natural to con-
sider that the formation of a complex molecule is the result of a building-up
procefis. It must be remembered, however, that in the living organism there is

always present a compound or mixture, or whatever we like to call it, of a highly

complex proteid nature, which, although at present indefinite from the purely
chemical point of view, is the essence of the vitality. Of course I refer to what
biologists have called protoplasm. Moreover, it is perhaps necessary to state what
as really nothing more than a truism, viz., that protoplasm is present in and forms a

--part of the organism from the very beginning of its existence from the germ to

the adult, and onwards to the end of life. Any special chemical properties per-

taining to protoplasm are inseparable from the animal or plant until that period

arrives which Keliule has hinted at when we shall be able to ' build up the forma-
tive elements of living organisms' in the laboratory.' But here I am afraid I am

allowing the imagination to take a flight which I told you a few minutes ago that
rtime would not admit of.

     The view that requires pu.shing forward into a more prominent po.sition than it

--'has hitherto occupied is that all the chemical transformations in the organism at
--any rate all the primary changes are made possible only by the antecedent com-

'bination of the substances concerned with living protoplasmic materials. The
·carbon dioxide, water, &c., which the plant absorbs must have formed a compound
or compounds with the protoplasmic material of the chloroplasts before starch, or
sugar, or cellulose can be prepared. There is, on this view, no such process as the
direct combmation of dead molecules to build up a complex sub.^tance. Everything
must pass through the vital mill. The protoplasmic molecule is vastly more

complex than anj' of the compounds which we have hitherto succeeded in
synthesising. It might take up and form new and unstable compounds with

·carbon dioxide or formic aldehyde, or sugar, or anything else, and our present
methods of investigation would fail to reveal the process. If this previous com-
bination and, so to speak, vitalisation of dead matter actually occurs, the appear-
ance of starch as the tir.st visible product of assimilation, as taught by Sachs, or
-the formation of a 12-carbon-atom sugar as the first carbohydrate, as shown by
the recent researches of Horace Brown and G. II. Morris, is no longer matter for
wonderment. The chemical equations given in physiological works are too purely

·chemical ; the physiologists have, I am afraid, credited the chemists with too much
knowledge--it would appear as though their intimate familiarity with vital pro-

cesses had led them to undervalue the importance of their prime agent. In giving
expression to these thoughts I cannot but feel that I am treating you to the strange
spectacle of a chemist pleading from the pliysiologists for a little more vitality in
 the chemical functions of living organisms. The future development of vital
chemistry rests, however, with the chemist and physiologist conjointly ; the isola-
 tion, identification, and analysis of the products of vital activity, which has
 hitherto been the task of the chemist, is only the preliminary work of physiological
·chemistry leading up to chemical physiology.

                        Peotoplasmic Theoet of Vital Synthesis.

      The supposition that chemical synthesis in the organism is the result of the
combination of highly complex molecules with simpler molecules, and that the
 unstable compounds thus formed then undergo decomposition with the formation
 of new products, may be provisionally called the protoplasmic theory of vital
 synthesis. From this standpoint many of the prevailing doctrines will have to

he inverted, and the formation of the more complex molecules will be considered to

precede the synthesis of the less complex. It may be urged that this view simply

throws back the process of vital synthesis one stage and leaves the question of the

origin of the most complex molecules still unexplained. I grant thisator.ce; but

in doing so I am simply acknowledging that we have not yet solved the enigma of

Welife.    are in precisely the same position as is the biologist with respect to

abiogenesis, or the so-called ' spontaneous generation.' To avoid possible mis-

conception let me here state that the protoplasmic theory in no way necessitates

the assumption of a special ' vital force.' All that is claimed is a peculiar, and at

present to us mysterious, power of forming high-grade chemical combinations

with appropriate molecules. It is not altogether absurd to suppose that this

power is a special property of uitrogen in certain forms of combination. The

theory is but an extension of the views of Kiihne, Hoppe-Seyler, and others

respecting the mode of action of enzymes. Neither is the view of the degrada-

tional origin of synthetical products in any way new.^ I merely have thought it

desirable to push it to its extreme limit in order that chemists may realise that

there is a special chemistry of protoplasmic action, while the physiologists may

exercise more caution in representing vital chemical transformations by equations

which are in many cases purely hypothetical, or are based on laboratory experi-

ments which do not run parallel with the natural process. The chemical trans-

formations which go on in the living organism are thus referred back to a

peculiarity of protoplasmic matter, the explanation of which is bound up with the

inner mechanism of the process of assimilation. If, as the protoplasmic theory

implies, there must be combination of living protoplasm with appropriate com-

pounds before synthesis is possible, then the problem resolves itself into a

determination of the conditions which render such combination possible i.e., the

conditions of assimilation. It may be that here also light will come from the

stereochemical hypothesis. The first step was taken when Pasteur found that

organised ferments had the power of discriminating between physical isomerides

a similar selective power has been shown to reside in enzymes by the researches

of Emil Fischer and his coadjutors. Fischer has quite recently expressed the view

that the synthesis of sugars in the plant is preceded by the formation of a com-

pound of carbon dioxide, or of formic aldehyde, with the protoplasmic material of

the chloroplast, and similar views have been enunciated by Stohmann. The

question has lurther been raised by van 't Hofi", as well as by Fischer, whether a

stereochemical relationship between the living and dead compounds entering into

combination is not an absolutely essential condition of all assimilation. The

settlement of this question cannot but lead us onwards one stage towards the

solution of the mystery that still surrounds the chemistry of the living

organism,

    The past year has been such an eventful one in the way of startling discoveries
that I must ask indulgence for trespassing a little further upon the time of the

Section. It was only last year at the Oxford meeting of the British Association
that Lord Rayleigh and Prof. Eamsay announced the discovery of a gaseous con-
stituent of the atmosphere which had up to that time escaped detection. The com-

plete justification of that announcement is now before the world in the paper
recently published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' of the Royal Society. The
history of this brilliant piece of work is too recent to require much recapitulation.
I need only remind you how, as the result of many years' patient determinations of

the density of the gases oxygen and nitrogen, Lord Rayleigh established the fact
that atmospheric nitrogen was heavier than nitrogen from chemical sources, and

was then led to suspect the existence of a heavier gas in the atmosphere. He set

to work to isolate this substance, and succeeded in doing so by the method of

Cavendish. In the meantime Prof. Ramsay, quite independently, isolated the gas

by removing the nitrogen by means of red-hot magnesium, and the two investi-

gators then combining their labours, followed up the subject, and have given us a

memoir which will go down to posterity among the greatest achievements of an age

renowned for its scientific activity.

The case in favour of  argon being an element  seems to                                                            be  now settled by the

discovery that the molecule of the gas is monatomic, as well as by the distinctness

of its electric spark spectrum. The suggestion put forward soon after the discovery

was announced, that the gas was an oxide of nitrogen, must have been made in
complete ignorance of the methods by wliich it was prepared. The possibility of

its being N^ has been considered by the discoverers and rejected on very good

grounds. Moreover, Peratoner and Oddo have been recently making some experi-

ments in the laboratory of the University of Palermo with the object of examining

the products of the electrolysis of hydrazoic acid and its salts. They obtained

only ordinary nitrogen, not argon, and have come to the conclusion that the anhy-

dride N3.N3 is incapable of existence, and that no allotropic form of nitrogen is

given oft'. It has been urged that the physical evidence in support of the mon-

--atomic nature of the argon molecule, viz., the ratio of the specific heats, is capable

of another interpretation that argon is in fact an element of such extraordinary

energy that its atoms cannot be separated, but are bound together as a rigid system

which transmits the vibrational energy of a sound-wave as motion of translation
only. If this be the state of affairs we must look to the physicists for more light.

So far as chemistry is concerned, this conception introduces an entirely new set of

ideas, and raises the question of the monatomic character of the mercury molecule

which is in the same category with respect to the physical evidence. It seems

unreasonable to invoke a special power of atomic linkage to explain the monatomic

character of argon, and to refuse such a power in the case of other monatomic

molecules, like mercury or cadmium. The chemical inertness of argon has been

referred also to this same power of self-combination of its atoms. If this explana-

tion be adopted it carries with it the admission that those elements of which the

atoms composing the molecule are the more easily dissociated should be the more

chemically active. The reverse appears to be the case if we bear in mind Victor

Meyer's researches on the dissociation of the halogens, which prove that under the

influence of heat the least active element, iodine, is the most easily dissociated.

On the whole, the attempts to make out that argon is polyatomic by such forced

hypotheses cannot at present be considered to have been successful, and the con-

tention of the discoverers that its molecule is monatomic must be accepted as

established.

In searching for a natural source of combined argon Professor Ramsay was led

to examine the gases contained in certain uranium and other minerals, and by steps

which are now well known he has been able to isolate helium, a gas which was

discovered by means of the spectroscope in the solar chromosphere by Professor
Norman Lockyer in 1868. In his address to the British Association in 1872 ' the

late Dr. W. B. Carpenter said :

    ' But when Frankland and Lockyer, seeing in the spectrum of the yellow solar

prominences a certain bright line not identifiable with that of any known terrestrial
flame, attribute this to a hypothetical new substance which they propose to call

helium, it is obvious that their assumption rests on a far less secure foundation,

until it shall have received that verification which, in the case of Mr. Crookes' re-

searches on thallium, was afforded by the actual discovery of the new metal, whose
presence had been indicated to him by a line in the spectrum not attributable to

anj' substance then known.'

     It must be as gratifying to Professor Lockyer as it is to the chemical world

at large to know that helium may now be removed from the category of solar
myths and enrolled among the elements of terrestrial matter. The sources, mode

 of isolation, and properties of this gas have been described in the papers recently-
 published by Professor Ramsay and his colleagues. Not the least interesting fact
 is the occurrence of helium and argon in meteoric iron from Virginia, as announced

 by Professor Ramsay in July.' Like argon, helium is monatomic and chemically
 inert so far as the present evidence goes. The conditions under which this element

 exists in cleveite, uraninite, and the other minerals have yet to be determined.

      Taking a general survey of the results thus far obtained, it seems that two
 representatives of a new group of monatomic elements characterised by chemical
 inertness have been brought to light. Their inertness obviously interposes great
 difficulties in the way of their further study from the chemical side; the future
development of our knowledge of these elements may be looked for from the
 physicist and spectroscopist. Professor Ramsay has not yet succeeded in eff'ectino'

 a combination between argon or helium and any of the other chemical elements.
 M. Moissan finds that fluorine is without action on argon. M. Berthelot claims

to have brought about a combination of argon with carbon disulphide and mercury,
 and with ' the elements of benzene, . . , with the help of mercury,' under the

 influence of the silent electric discharge. Some experiments which I made last

 spring with Mr. R. J. Strutt with argon and moist acetylene submitted to the electric

 discharge, both silent and disruptive, gave very little hope of a combination between
argon and carbon being possible by this means. The coincidence of the helium
yellow line with the Dj line of the solar chromosphere has been challenged, but the
recent accurate measurements of the wave-length of the chromospheric line by Prof.
G. E. Hale, and of the line of terrestrial helium by Profs. Runge and Paschen, leave

no doubt as to their identity. Both the solar and terrestrial lines have now been
shown to be double. The isolation of helium has not only furnished another link

proving community of matter, and, by inference, of origin between the earth and sun,
but an extension of the work by Professor Norman Lockyer, M. Deslandres, and
Mr. Crookes, has resulted in the most interesting discovery that a large number of

the lines in the chromo.«pheric spectrum, as well as in certain stellar spectra, which
had up to the present time found no counterparts in the spectra of terrestrial elements
can now be accounted for by the spectra of gases contained with helium in these
rare minerals. The question now confronts us. Are these gases members of the same
monatomic inert group as argon and helium ? Whether, and by what mechanism, a
monatomic gas can give a complicated spectrum is a physical question of supreme
interest to chemists, and I hope that a discussion of this subject with our colleagues

Aof Section will be held during the present meeting. That mercury is capable under

diflijrent conditions of giving a series of highlj' complex spectra can be seen from

the memoir by J. M. Eder and E. Valenta, presented to the Imperial Academy of
Sciences of Vienna in July 1894. With respect to the position of argon and
helium in the periodic system of chemical elements, it is, as Professor Ramsay
points out, premature to speculate until we are quite sure that these gases are homo-
geneous. It is possible that they may be mixtures of monatomic gase.s, and in fact

the spectroscope has already given an indication that they contain some constituent
in common. The question whether these gases are mixtures or not presses for an
immediate answer. I will venture to suggest that an attack should be made by
the method of diff'usion. If argon or helium were allowed to diffuse fractionally
through a long porous plug into an exhausted vessel there might be some separation

into gases of different den.sities, and showing modifications in their spectra, on the

assumption that we are dealing with mixtures composed of molecules of different

weights.

1. A New View of the Genesis of Dalton's Atomic Theory, derived from

  Original Manuscripts.

Harden.

   A number of previously unknown manuscript volumes in Dalton's writing have

been found in the library of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society.

These consist of laboratory note-books containing the record of Dalton's practical

work from the year 1802 onwards, and the notes used by him for some of the
lectures delivered at the Royal Institution, London, in 1810.

     The examination of these volumes has cast au unexpected light on the genesis
of the atomic theory, and the relation in which that theory stands to the law of
combination in multiple proportions. Neither in Dalton's published papers, nor in

the ' New System,' was any satisfactory account to be found of the genesis of his

theories and hence the question as to whether the atomic theory was founded on
an experimental knowledge of the law of combination, or whether Dalton arrived
at this law as a necessary consequence of the atomic theory of matter, was not
to be gathered from his own writings. The balance of evidence derived from
these newly discovered documents is strongly in favour of the statement made in
London by Dalton himself, in 1810, that he was led to adopt the atomic theory of
chemistry in the first instance by purely physical considerations, in opposition to the
view, hitherto held by chemists, that the discovery by Dalton of the fact of com-
bination in multiple proportions led him to devise the atomic theory as an

explanation.

3. The Action of Nitric Oxide on some Metallic Salts.

 By H. A. AuDEN, B.Sc, and Q. J. Fowlee, M.Sc.

     The experiments here recorded are part of a systematic investigation into the
conditions of stability of the oxides of nitrogen. They are by no means complete,
but the results so far obtained appear to be of sufficient interest to warrant a

preliminary notice.    nitric  oxide  have  so     far  alone   been                st. udji-edj,          rip,he gas was

sulphuric acid, and mercurv. The mixture was kept in continual agitation by a
specially contrived stirrer, worked by a turbine. In this way a regular stream of

gas is obtained, which analysis showed to be of a high state of purjty.
     In order to study the action of nitric oxide upon the salts selected a weighed

amount of the salt was placed in a boat contamed in a Lotbar Meyer constant

temperature furnace. By means of a thermostat, also devised by Lothar Meyer^

the temperature can be kept constant to within one degree. Temperatures above
the rano-e of an ordinary instrument were measured by means of a high tempera-

ture thermometer, constructed by Max Kaehler and Martini, of Berhn, which

would give accurate readings to over 400°.              of                   _             _  and,         t,he p,henomena

 nitric oxide the action begins at 15°, but does not attain its maximum till over

 130°.

     MnOo behaves similarly, but the change is not so rapid. It attains a maximum

 at 216°. In neither case is any but a trace of a nitrite foi'med.

       Silver oxide, if containing traces of moisture, yields a mixture of almost
 equivalent parts of silver nitrite and metallic silver at the ordinary temperature.

 At higher temperatures, with the dry oxide, nitrate and metallic silver are formed

 almost entirely.

     Silver permanganate behaves, when treated with nitric oxide, very much as a
compound of oxide of silver and a higher oxide of manganese might be supposed

 to do. It begins to be attached at the ordinary temperature, and at 80° the
alteration is very rapid. The residue was found to consist of metallic silver, silver
oxide, silver nitrate, and manganese dioxide. Very little, if any, manganese
nitrate was formed.

     Potassium permanganate is much more stable than the silver salt. It is not

 appreciably attacked till a temperature of over 100° is reached, and tbe increase
 in weight becomes rapid at 190°.

     The residue on moistening was not alkaline, and no manganese could be dis-
solved out. The potassium is converted into nitrate, and the manganese into

oxide.

      Interesting differences were noted in the behaviour of other silver and potassium
salts, notably, the chlorate and iodate.

      Potassium chlorate is attacked by nitric oxide at the ordinary temperature,
chlorine being evolved in considerable quantity, and nitric peroxide being formed.
The gaseous product was condensed in a tube immersed in a freezing mixture, and
the percentage of chlorine in the brown liquid obtained was determined. It was

found to be much in defect of that required to form nitrosyl or nitroxyl chloride.

So that the reaction does not consist simply in the formation of an oxychloride of

nitrogen. On analysis of the residue in the boat, no chloride of potassium was
found to be present. Nitrate was formed, and also a irace of perchlorate. This

seems to be direct proof that in potassium chlorate the potassium and chlorine are

separated.

     With barium chlorate a similar reaction takes places.
    With silver chlorate (prepared according to Stas's method from silver oxide)
chlorine was given off, but a considerable amount of silver chloride was also
formed, nearly one-third of the silver present being found as chloride. This may

be due to a difference in constitution between the chlorates of silver and of
potassium, or to a difference in the stability of the salts and the products of

reaction.

     That some difference of constitution exists between the silver and potassium

salts appears to derive confirmation from the behaviour of their iodates when

treated with nitric oxide.

     Potassium iodate heated to 80° in nitric oxide begins to give off iodine, and
the reaction becomes rapid at 110°, crystals of iodine condensing on the cool
portion of the tube ; no trace of iodide, however, is formed, as is shown by there
being no liberation of iodine on acidifying a solution of the residue after adding
some potassium iodate. The residue is not alkaline, the potassium being converted

into nitrate, recognised by the evolution of ammonia when the residue is warmed

with zinc dust and caustic soda.

     Silver iodate, on the other hand, is stable up to a rather higher temperature
than the potassium salt, and when heated above this temperature, about 110°,
no trace of iodine is given off, but all the silver is converted into iodide, none being
dissolved out by water, and the yellow residue being insoluble in dilute nitric

acid.

     The perchlorates and periodates which have been examined show themselves
more stable than the corresponding chlorates and iodates.

     Of the salts so far examined the chromates have shown themselves the most

stable, being analogous in this respect to the sulphates.

     Lead chromate was unaltered at temperatures exceedi:ig 4C0°.

     Silver chromate did not suffer appreciable change till above 300°. Metallic
silver was found to be present in the residue as well as silver nitrate. The

chromium was all converted into the sesquioxide. Some amount of nitrite of
silver was also formed.

      Silver siilphate is only attacked at the highest temperature of the furnace.

  --It was found in certain cases e.g., with lead nitrate that the intermixture of
--a decomposable oxide e.g., PbO,,or MnOj with the salt, caused the latter to be

attacked at a temperature below that at which action begins with either the salt

or oxide taken separately.
     Experiments have also been in progress on the interaction -of nitric oxide and

various gases, but the results are not yet quite complete enough for publication.

4. On the Respirahility of Air in which a Candle Flame has burnt until it
                   is extinguished. By Frank Clowes, D.Sc.

At the last meeting of the British Association the author stated the composi-

tion of artificial mixtures of nitrogen and carbon dioxide with air, which were

just able to extinguish various flames. It was found that the flames of ordinary

candles and lamps were extinguished by mixtures which contained on the average

Aabout 16'5 per cent, of oxygen and 83"5 per cent, of the extinctive gases.  flame

of coal-gas, however, required for its extinction a mixture still poorer in oxygen,

and containing 11-3 per cent, of oxygen and 88"7 per cent, of the extinctive gases.

These results have since been confirmed by a different method. The method con-

sisted in allowing the flames to burn in air enclosed over mercury until they were

extinguished ; the remaining extinctive atmosphere was then subjected to analysis,

and its composition was found to be practically identical with that previously

Anobtained from the artificial mixtures.  analysis of air expired from the lungs

proved that it was also of the same composition as that which extinguished the

flame of an ordinary candle or lamp.

     The average percentage composition of expired air and of air which extin-

--guishes a candle flame is as follows: oxygen 16'4, nitrogen 80'5, carbon

dioxide, o'l.

    Now an atmosphere of this composition is undoubtedly respirable. Physio-

logists state that air may be breathed until its oxygen is reduced to 10 per cent.
The maximum amount of carbon dioxide which may he present is open to question,

but it is undoubtedly considerably higher than 3 per cent. Br. Haldane maintains
that the above atmosphere is not only respirable, but would be breathed by a
healthy person without inconvenience of anj' kind ; he further .states that no per-
manent injury would result from breathing such an atmosphere for some time.

     The conclusion to be drawn from these facts is that an atmosphere must not be

considered to be dangerous and irrespirable because the flame of an ordinary candle

or oil lamp is extinguished by it. The view is very generally advanced that a man

must, on no account, venture into air which extinguishes the flame of a caudle or

of a bundle of shavings. It will be seen thut this precaution may deter one from

entering an atmosphere which is perfectly safe and respirable, and from doing duty

of a humane or necessary character. An atmosphere which extinguishes a coal-

gas flame, however, appears to approach closely to the limit of respirahility, as far
as the proportion of oxygen which it contains is concerned. Hence the coal-gas

flame appears to be a more trustworthy indicator of respirahility than the flame of
a caudle or oil-lamp. Undoubtedly the candle and lamp flames should be discarded

as tests of respirahility of air.

   5. 2'he Action of Light upon the Soluble Metallic Iodides in presence of

       Cellulose. By Douglas J. P. Berridge, B.A., Malvern College.

     It was shown by Cook, in 1894, that whilst potassium iodide, purified by
ordinary methods, is decomposed by light, the salt is not thus affected if purified
by either fusion with charcoal or crystallisation from absolute alcohol. Although

                                                                             I
                                                                     :

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                       659

this is so, the iodide is readily decomposed, even when jjerfectl}- pure, when

exposed to lin^ht in the presence of cellulose, the most suitable" form of this
material being filter-paper, which has been extracted by hydrochloric and hydro-

fluoric acids. If a solution of the ordinary pure salt is" sealed in a bulb and
exposed to light, whilst in another bulb is placed an equal quantity of the same
solution, together with pure cellulose, it is found that considerably more iodine is
liberated in the latter tlian in the former: this difference in many cases amounting
to 800 per cent. The solution not containing cellulose gives an alkaline reaction
with phenolphthalein, whilst one sealed with sufficient cellulose is quite neutral
the action of the cellulose is therefore probably due to its combination with any
potassium hydrate produced by the oxidation of the iodide in presence of light and

moisture.

      .If_a slieet of note-paper containing starch is saturated with a solution of
potassium iodide, and exposed to light in a printing frame under a negative, it
will become printed in a period varying from ten minutes to four hours, the colour

of the exposed paper being pink or chocolate; this changes, however, to blue when

placed in water, the alteration being doubtless due to the formation of the so-called
starch iodide, for the production of which the presence of an excess of water is
necessary. It was found impossible to imitate this chocolate colour by any solu-
tion of iodine: if the solution was aqueous, a blue stain was produced, whilst, if

anhydrous, a brown stain resulted. At last, however, the colour of the exposed
paper was obtained by the action of a very concentrated solution of potassium
iodide upon paper previously coloured blue by starch iodide. This appears to show

that the colour is due to the formation of potassium triiodide, or some similar
compound.

     The prints obtained in this manner were fixed by rapid washirg in water,
followed by treatment with a dilute solution of lead acetate ; if subsequently sized
and varnished, they appear to be quite stable.

     The iodides of sodium, calcium, strontium, barium, iron, and zinc, all behave
like the potassiurn salt; the two latter, however, yield prints difficult to see, owing
to tlie decomposition of the salt upon the portions of the paper unexposed to the

light.

    Cadmium iodide differs from tlie other soluble metallic iodides in yielding a

print which is blue, and uDt chocolate coloured; from which it appears that this
element is alone unable to form a higher iodide.

     Two stations were started in AVest Suflblk in 1893, one on the chalk at Higham,

--the other on a good deep loam at Lavenham both typical soils in the county.

Crops are grown at each station in rotation with various manures, and an annual
report is printed and circulated among farmers of the county. Demonstrations
are given on the plots on the action of manure', the methods and effects of potato
spraying, kc. Expenses are borne by West Suffolk Technical Instruction Com-
mittee, and the management is under the Cambridge and Counties Agricultural
 Education Scheme.

      In Norfolk the arrangements are different. The experiments, started in 1886,
 are conducted by the Chamber of Agriculture ; since 1 888 they have received an
 annual grant from the Board of Agriculture, and since 1892 one from the Techni-
 cal Education Committee of the Norfolk County Council. The experiments have

 included manurial experiments on all the ordinary crops in the usual course of

 farming ; the comparison of many well-known varieties of wheat and barley ; the

 value of residues of manures, and various sheep-feeding experiments to test the

 value of oil in cakes very rich in oil ; the comparison of the values of many popular

 diets ; the determination of the most economical rations, itc.

      Besides the.^e experiments in the field a considerable amount of laboratory work

 1. Some Remarks on Orthochromatic Photography. By Dr. H. W. VoGEL.
     My first researches on orthochromatic photography were published twenty-three

  years ago. These investigations were confirmed hj Becquerel and were first
  brought under the notice of the English public by Meldola in 1874.

   In India, in 1875, at my suggestion Colonel Waterhouse used bromide of silver

   collodion plates dyed with eosin. The success of his experiments demonstrates

   that eosin was the best optical sensitiser for collodion plates. Later Ducos de

   Hauron employed orthochromatic plates in his photochrome or three-colour

   printing process. Attout-Tailfer next introduced isochromatic gelatine dry

   plates dyed with eosin or its derivatives, in conjunction with an alkali. I used

   --azaline a mi.xture of quinoline blue and quinoline red-- for the same purpose
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

   whilst Eder, of Vienna, recommended erythrosin (tetra-iodo-tluorescein) as the

   best optical sensitiser for dry plates. In 1885 Obernetter and I showed that by

   the use of eoside of silver pla^s it was possible to dispense with a yellow screen

   for ordinary landscape photography. I find that the best results are obtained with

   a film containing 1,000 parts of collodion (containing seventeen of cotton) to

   three parts aurantia. The exposure required in this case is four times as long

   as when no yellow screen is employed. For landscapes only two parts of aurantia

   are necessary, and the exposure required is only two and a half times longer than

   without a screen. Another important factor in regard to orthochromatic plates is

   Mythe action of the developer.                                                                                                                             own results show that the impressions of the

   blue rays develop before those of the red and yellow, and, therefore, when using

   eosin dyed plates they should be developed until all the yellow parts of the picture

   are visible in the negative. It is usually stated that the relative value of colours

   in a landscape approximates more closely at sunrise and at sunset than at noon,

   and, therefore, that in the former case a yellow screen is unnecessary when using

   orthochromatic plates. This would be true were direct sunlight the only agent,

   but since difl'used light also comes into play it is not the case, for Crova has shown

   that the proportion of blue rays in diffused light increases as the sun goes down,

   whilst the reverse bolds for direct sunlight. With orthochromatic plates the

   results depend on (1) the colour sensitiveness of the plate; (2) the proportion
   of the different coloured rays in the diffused light : and this proportion, I find, varies

   from day to day.

   I gather from Captain Abney's paper in the 'Photographic Journal ' that the

   sensitiveness of the plates he employed for yellow rays was only fths of that

   for blue. To this fact I attribute the unsatisfactory results he obtained. In

   Germany we use eosin dj'ed plates, the sensitiveness of which is five times

   greater for yellow rays than for blue rays. Such plates can be used for landscapes

   without a yellow screen. The prints exhibited to the Section show the com-

   parative results obtained with ordinary plates and plates of this kind. The

   pictures were taken at 3 p.m.

   2. On the Sensitising Action of Dyes on Gelatino-bramide Plates.
                             By C. H. BOTHAMLEY.

   Although large numbers of dyes have been examined since Dr. H. W. Vogel's

   discovery in 1873, very few exert any marked effect in making gelatino-bromide

   plates sensitive to the less refrangible rays of the spectrum. Only cyanin and the

   dyes of the eosin group (including the rhodamines), with perhaps malachite green,

   chrysoidine, and alizarin blue, can be said to exert any useful effect.

       The main points established by previous observers may be summarised as follows

   (1) The dyes that act as sensitisers are readily affected by light when they are in con-

   tact with fabrics, paper, &c.                                                                                                                              (2) in order that a dye may act as a sensitiser it must
                                                                                                                                                           ;

   have the power of entering into intimate union with silver bromide, forming a

   kind of  ' lake '                         (3)  and it must                                                                                                 show a strong  absorption band for the particular
                                          ;

   rays for which it is to sensitise. Although these statements hold good for all the

   dyes that are known to act as sensitisers, it is important to observe that the con-

   verse is not necessarily true. Several dyes having all these properties show no

   appreciable sensitising action.

   Experiments by Dr. E. Vogel on the rate of fading and the sensitising action of

   the eosin dyes, led him to the conclusion that the order of sensitising effect coin-

   cides with the order of fading when the dyes are exposed to light. The order in

   which Vogel places the dyes does not, however, correspond with the order of fading

k
--662 REPORT 1895.

as observed in dyed fabrics, and the experimental method that he used is open to

criticism.

    The author's observations on the fading of the various sensitisers, when exposed
to light in contact with gelatin, lead him to the conclusion that, although all the

sensitisers are readily affected by light, the order of sensitising effect does not
necessarily correspond with the order of fading, whether the dj"es belong to the
same chemical group or not.

     There are two chief hypotheses as to the mode in which the dyes act, namely :
(1) the view held by Abney that the dye itself is oxidised by the action of light,
the oxidation product remaining in contact with the silver bromide ; and when the

plate is treated with the developer, the latter and the oxidation product acting
simultaneously on the silver bromide bring about its reduction ; and (2) the view
first definitely formulated by Eder, and endorsed by Vogel, namely, that the energy
absorbed by the dyed silver bromide is partially used up in bringing about the
chemical decomposition of the silver bromide, instead of being almost entirely con-

verted into heat, as when absorbed by the d^e alone.
     The author has found that the less refrangible rays will produce a photographic

image on the sensitised gelatino-bromide plates, when they are immersed in

powerfully reducing solutions, such as a mixture of sodium sulphite and pyro-
gallol. This holds good for cyanin, the eosin dyes, the rhodamines, and quinoline
red, whether the seusitiser has been added to the emulsion or has been applied to
the prepared plate in the form of a bath. It is, therefore, impossible to attribute
the sensitising effect to any intermediate oxidation of the dye.

      Experiments with various reagents such as potassium bromide, potassium dichro-
mate, mercuric chloride, and dilute hydrogen peroxide seem to show that the
 chemical nature of the latent image produced by the less refrangible rays on the
specially sensitised plates is precisely the same as that of the latent image produced
 by the more refrangible rays in the ordinary way.

      Further proof in the same direction is aff'orded by the fact that the effect of the
 sensitisers extends to the production of a visible effect by the prolonged action of

 light.

      The balance of evidence is therefore greatly in favour of the view that the dye
absorbs the particular group of rays, and, in some way- which is not at all clear,
hands on the energv' to the silver bromide, with which it is intimately associated,
iind which is thereby decomposed.

      For the pi-esent, for want of a better word, the phenomenon might be distin-
guished a.s 2}ftoto-rataIt/sis, und the sensitiser might be described as & jihoto-catalytic
agent. As yet no connection can be traced between the chemical constitution and
the general physical properties of a dye, and its sensitising action.

                            4. On some Stilbene Derivatives.
                    By J. J. SUDBOROUGH, D.Sc, Ph.D., F.I.C.

      The author has prepared monochloro-, methyl-chloro-, and ethyl-chloro-
 stilbene by the action of phosphorus pentachloride on deoxybenzoin and on its
 methyl and ethyl derivatives. The monochloro-stilbene differs from that described
 by Zinin (' Annalen,' 149. 375), as it is a solid, which crystallises from alcohol in
 large colourless plates. It melts at 63°-54°, and fields additive compounds with
 bromine, with chlorine and with ' nitrous acid.' These, together with the corre-
 sponding compounds obtained from methyl- and from ethyl-chloro-stilbene, are

 described. An oily monochloro-stilbene, corresponding to that of Zinin, has also

 been prepared, and is being subjected to further examination in order to determine
 whether it is merely an impure form of the crystalline compound or a true stereo-

 isomeride.

                   By J. J. SuDBOROUGH, D.Sc, Ph.D., F.I.C.

     The author draws attention to the fact that, as regards its etheriBcation,
camphoric acid shows a marked resemblance to some of the polycarboxylic acids
investigated by Victor Meyer and Sudborough (' Ber.,' 27, 314(5), and to hemi-
pinic acid (Wegscheider, ' Monatsheft,' 16, 75). It is thought that this resem-
blance may throw some light on the constitution of camphoric acid, and that at
any rate it' can be used as an argument for or against any formula which is brought
forward. The author then considers several of the more important formulae
already suggested, and regards those of Armstrong and of Bredt as best agreeing
with the behaviour of camphoric acid.

               very Dilute Solutions. By Dr. M. Wildeemann.

      7. The FormaUoyi and Properties of a New Organic Acid.
                 By Henry J. Horstman Fenton, M.A.

    When tartaric acid is oxidised under certain conditions in presence of a ferrous

salt a substance is produced which acts as a powerful reducing agent, and which
gives a beautiful violet colour with ferric salts in presence of alkali. This sub-

stance has after considerable dilHculty been isolated, and proves to be a dibasic

acid having the fovmula C JI,0^;.2n./).
    The coDStJtutiou of this acid is now under investigation.

     Heated with hydrogen iodide it gives succinic acid, racen.ic acid being an iiiter-
mediate product. Bromine in presence of water oxidises it quantitatively to dioxy-
tartaric acid. Heated with water it is resolved into carbon dioxide and glycollic

aldehyde.
      This aldeh3'de has been obtained as a viscid liquid, pure except for a trace of

ether ; and, on removing tlie latter by heating in a vacuum, the aldehyde under-

goes polymerisation, a sweet-tasting solid gum being the result. Analj^sis and
molecular weight determination show that this gummy substance has the formula

     Further observations have recently been made as to the conditions under which

this new acid may be obtained from tartaric acid. The presence of a ferrous salt

is essential. Ferric, manganous, and various other salts have been tried with

negative results.

If moist ferrous tartrate be exposed to the air for a short time a certain quantity

of the new acid is produced, and may be indicated by the characteristic violet

colour given when caustic alkali is added. The eflect is much more intense if the

exposure be made out of doors, and the increased result was at first attributed to

some  constituent  of the fresh  air (e.g., hydrogen dioxide ;                                                                                                        ozone seems to be
                                                                                                                                                                   _

inoperative). But later experiments show conclusively that light is the cause.

Air which has been purified by passing through potassium iodide and caustic potash

solutions gives an effect about equal in intensity to that produced by fresh external

air, if the exposure to light be the same in both cases. That oxygen (or some

oxidising agent) is essential is shown by the fact that exposure in a vacuum, even

to bright sunlight, gives a negative result.

  8. On the Velocity of Reaction before Perfect Eqnilibriiom takes place.
                           By Meyer Wildeemann, Ph.D.

     The solidification and the crystallisation of over-cooled liquids, as well as the
melting of frozen and solidified liquids, belong to processes which occur most
generally in nature; therefore it is of importance to know the velocity with
--Gu4 REPORT 1895.

wbicli these processes tate place, and to find the common equation for all of

them.

   --1. On the Velocity of Solidification of Over-cooled Liquids, of Solutions, and of

Liquid Mixtures. From the experiments of Moore, made in Ostwalds laboratory,'
                                                       dv

the author shows that the equation -^ =c{t^^--t) is to be applied for the velocity

of solidification, where t is the actually existing- temperatui'e of the over-cooled

liquid, ^0 the temperature, where the solid and liquid solution are in equilibrium,

since beginning with the greater differences (instead of as has been done by Moore,
-- ----with the smaller) tn t, it is easy to show that -"
                    = ~'- > '-                           "1 '

                                                                                  t^-t,, {d.v_:clz)i,,

--2. On the Velocity of Crystalhsafio7i of Over-cooled Liquids and Solutions.

The same equation -- = c(tf^ -- t) is found to be applied for the velocity of crystal-

lisation. Now, since the separation of the solid solvent is accompanied by evolu-

tion of heat (latent heat of melting), and the increase of the temperature of the

liquid is directly proportional to the quantity of separated ice, we can, instead of

the above equation, put - --= c'(^(j t), where c' is directly proportional to the latent

heat of melting, and inversely proportional to the specific heat of the liquid. Very
careful measurements have been carried out. The liquid was at first over-cooled

to below its freezing-point ; the distance from the freezing-point was then measured

on the '01° thermometer, and the time noted by my assistant to J second.
    3. On the Velocity of Meltivg of Solid Solvents in the Warmer Liquids and

--Solutions. For the process of melting, Newton's equation ' = c{tQ-- t) for conduc-

tion is to be used ; the convergence temperature is here that at which ice and liquid
are in equilibrium, i.e., the freezing-point ; the ice plays here the part of the cooling-

medium, abstracting heat from the liquid. Since now the velocity of reaction

takes place through the ice-surface, tlie velocity of reaction at a given time s will
be also directly proportional to the surface of the ice present in the liquid at the

times. Our equation can therefore get the form --=e'(^o- O*-^? where O is in

proportion to the surface of the ice. The liquid or solution to be investigated is
at first over-cooled 1° or 1°'2 below its freezing-temperature; the ice is then
crystallised. After the separation of the ice we allow the ice to rise in the beaker
to the upper part of the liquid, warm the liquid to about 0°-3 or 0°-4 above tlie
freezing-point ; the liquid is then stirred, the temperature rises at first, and after
reaching its luaximum falls. The time is measured to J second.

    We have therefore investigated two classes of reactions before perfect equili-

brium takes place. The first is where the temperature of both parts of the hetero-
geneous system is below or above the temperature of equilibrium (solidification,

crystallisation). For this class we have to apply the equation 1 =c(ff^--t) or

_ =c'(fo -- <), which in its form, but not in its purport, is identical with Newton's

dz
equation for conduction. Tlie second class is where one of the parts of the hetero-
geneous system is at the temperature of equilibrium and the other is above or

below tbat of equilibrium (melting process in liquids). The velocity of these pro-
cesses is regulated by Newton's law for conduction.

     As we know, we have two kinds of equilibrium, j9er/ec< and imperfect equili-

brium. While in the case of perfect equilibrium (for example, ice and water) at
a constant pressure, the smallest change of temperature is sufiicient to cause one
of the parts of the heterogeneous system to disappear, in the case of imperfect
equilibrium (for example, acid + alcohol, ether -h water) a small change of tempera-
ture produces only a small change in the state of equilibrium, while the relation

of the quantities of the acting parts changes in one or the other direction. The

velocity of reaction, hefore imperfect equilibrium takes place, i'ormecl the subject

of investigation of many scientists ; Vernon-Harcourt and Esson, van 't Hoff, Guld-
berg, and Wange, should be specially mentioned. The author huds in the case of

-- --solidification acd crystallisation that the equation =r^ c (^^ f), or =c'{f.^ t)\'s,
                                                                                           nz dz

to be applied, but would express the common equation as ,' =/(^o~0i since the

velocity of the reaction can often be complicated by other phenomena.

    Let us now bring into connection the equations for the two kinds of velocity of

reactions with the two kinds of equilibrium.
     lu the case of imperfect equilibrium we have, before the state of equilibrium is

arrived at, two reactions:

~dv = c{A -- .v) (B -- a') (alcohol + acid)

ds

fd.i  =  c'.v'~  (ether + water),

(j^y

-- --and equilibrium is arrived at when c(A .r') (B =.r') e'.r'^, ?'.e., both reactions

take place simultaneously and the equilibrium is a dy7iamic one. In the case of

perfect equilibrium we have before the equilibrium is arrived at

and equilibrium is arrived at when <y -- < = {i.e., at the freezing temperature);

-- therefore at the point of equilibrium equals 0, that is to say, no further reaction

takes place, and the equilibrium is a static one.

  9. Chemical History of Barley Plants. By C. F. Cross and C. Smith.

    Work has been carried out over a period of two years (1894 and 1895) upon
crops grown on the experimental plots at AVoburn. Maximum plot 6 and minimum

plot 1 were investigated with regard to the fiu'fural and permanent tissue which
they contain.

   A table of results is appended to the paper.

  --From the table we draw the following conclusions :

     1. The conditions of soil nutrition have very little influence upon the composi-

tion of the plant.

     2. The feeding talue of straws grown in wet seasons is high, and conversely
the paper-making value of such straws is low.

     '6. The furfuroids are continuously assimilated to permanent tissue in a normal
season, but in a dry season, on the other hand, the permanent tissue is pat under
contribution for nutrient material, which is ordinarily drawn from the cell contents.

President of the Section.--W. Whitakeb, B.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12.

The President delivered the following- Address :--

                  Undeegkound in Suffolk and its Borders.

When the British Association revisits a town it is not unusual for the Sectional

Presidents to refer to the addresses of their local predecessors, and to allude to the

advance of their science since the former meeting-. I have at all events tried to

follow this course, with the sad result of having to chronicle a fallino- hack rather

than an advance in our methods of procedure ; for at the meeting of 1851 all the

Sectional Presidents had the wisdom not to give an address, and of all the inven-

tions of later years I look upon the presidential address as perhaps the worst.

Had  I  the       courage  of my  opinion  I  should                             not  now  trouble  you                       but  an
                                                                                                                           ;

official life of over thirty-eight years has led me to do what I am told 'to do, and to

mysuppress  own ideas of what is right. After all it is the fault of the Sections

themselves that they should suffer the evil of addresses. They could disestablish

the institution without difliculty.

On these occasions it is not usual to allude to the personal losses our science

has had in the past year ; but there are times when the lack of a familiar presence

can hardly be passed over, and since we last met we have lost one of our most
constant friends, who had served us long and well, and had been our Secretary for

a far longer time than any other holder of that office. When we were at Oxford

last summer none of us could have thought that it was our last meetine- with

William Topley.

I do not now msan to say anything on the origin or on the classification of the

various divisions of the Crag and of the Drift that occur so plentifully around us,
and form the staple interest of East Anglian geology. These subjects, which are

the more interesting from being controversial, I leave to my brother-hammerers,

and without claiming the credit of magnanimity in so doing, having said what I

had to say on them in sundry Geological Survey Memoirs. The object of this address

is to carry you below the surfr.ce, and to point out how much our knowledge

of the geology of the county in which we meet has been advanced by workers in

anotiier field, by engineers and others in their search for water. As far as possihle

allusion will be  made  only to work  in   Suftolk                               but we  must  occasionally invade
                                                                              ;

the neighbouring counties.

This kind of evidence has chiefly accumulated since the meeting of the Associa-

tion at Ipswich in 1851 ; for of the 476 Suffolk wells of which an account, with
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                   667

some geologic infovmation, has been published, only 6S were noticed before that

year, all but two of these being in a single paper. The notes on all these wells

are now to be found in twelve Geological Survey Memoirs that refer to the county.

Numbei' alone, however, is not the only point, and many of the later records are

marked by a precision and a detail rarely approached in the older ones. It should

be stated that in the above and in the following numbers strict accuracy is not

Aprofessed, nor is it material.  slight error in the number of the wells, one way

or the other, would make practically no ditiereiice to the general conclusions.

    Now let us see how these records affect our knowledge of the various geologic

formations, beginning with the newest and working downward.

                                                   The Drift.

     Under this head, as a matter of convenience for the present purpose, we will

include everything above the Chillesford Clay. There is no need for relinement of
classification, and the thin beds that come in between that clay and the Drift in

some parts do not affect the evidence we have to deal with.
     As a matter of fact it is only from wells that we can tell the thickness of the

Drift over most of the great plateau that this formation chieflj^ forms ; open sections
through a great thickness of Drift, to its base, are rare, except on the coast.

     There is often some doubt in classifying the beds, the division between Drift
and Crag being sometimes hard to make in sections of wells and borings ; but from
an examination of the records of these Suffolk sections that pass through any part

of the Drift Series (as defined above) wo find that no less than 173 show a thick-

ness of 50 feet and upward, whilst of these 34 prove no less than 100 feet of Drift,

many reaching to much more. Of the two that are said to show a thickness of
over i'OO feet and the one otlier said to be more than 300 ieet deep in Drilt, we can

hardly feel certain ; but such amounts have been recorded with certainty as occur-
ring in the neighbouring county of Essex.

     These great thicknesses (chiefly consisting of Boulder Clay) show the importance
of the Drift, and the impossibility of mapping the formations beneath with any
approach to accuracy, on the stipposition that the Drift is stripped off, as is the
case in the ordinnry geologic map. The records also show the varying thickness

of the Drift, and how difficult it often is therefore to estimate the thickness at a

given spot. Suuietimes the sections seem to point to the existence of channels

tilled with Drift, such as are found also in Esse.x and in Norfolk; and it may be

noted that in the northern inland part of the former county, one of these channels
has been traced, though of course not continuously, for some 11 miles along the
valley of the Cam, and at one place to the depth of 340 feet (or nearly 140 below

Asea-level), the bottom of the Drift moreover not having been reached even then.

channel of this sort seems to occur close lo us, in the midst of the town of Ipswich,
where, by St. Peters, one boring has pierced 70 feet of Drift, and another 127,
in ground but little above the sea-level.

    As the Drift sands and gravels, that in many places occur below the Boulder
Clay, often yield a fair amount of water, the proof of their occurrence and of the

thickness of the overh ing clay is of some practical good.

                                                  The Crag.

    On this geologic division we have a less amoimt of information, as would be

expected from the fact that it is not nearly so widespread as the Drift, and this
information is confined to the Upper, or Red, Crag, the Lower, or Coralline, Crag
occurring only over a very sooall area, and no evidence of its underground exten-
sion being given by wells.

    What we learn of the Red Crag, however, is of interest, several wells having

proved that it is far thicker underground than would have been supposed from
what is seen where its base crops out. One characteristic, indeed, of this sandy
deposit, in the many parts where it can be seen from top to bottom, is its thinness,
668 REPORT-- 1895.

as ia such places it rarely reaches a tliickness of 40 feet. But, on the other hand,

wells at Hoxne seem to prove more than 60 feet of Crag, whilst at Saxmundham

the formation is 100 feet thick, and at Leiston and Southwold over 140. Further
north, just within the border of Suffolk, there is, at Beccles, a thickness of 80 feet
of sand, or, with the overlying Chillesford Clay, a total of 95. Our underground
information has, then, trebled the known thickness of the Upper Crag of Suttblk.

     It has also shown that at some depth underground the colour-name is a mis-
nomer, the shelly sands being light-coloured and not red. This is the case too
with some other deposits, which owe their reddish-brown colour at the surface to
peroxide of iron. Presumably the iron-s.alt is iu a lower state of oxidation until it
comes within reach of surface-actions. This seems to point to the risk of taking
colour as the mark of a geologic formation.

                                              Eocene Tertiaries.

     Below the Crag there is a great gap in the geologic series, and we couie to

some of the lower of the Tertiary formations, about which little liad been
published, as regards Suffolk, before the work of the Geological Survey in the
'county. It seems as if the special interest in the more local Crag had led
 observers to neglect these lieds, which had been amply noticed in other parts.

    We have records of more than forty wells in Suffolk that are partly in these

 deposits, and of these thirty-six reach down to the Chalk, twenty giving good
 sections from the London Clay to the Chalk. The thickness of the Lower London

 Tertiaries (between those formations) thus proved varies from 30 to 79i feet, the

 higher figure being much greater than anything shown at the outcrop. The

 greatest recorded thickness is at Leiston, where, moreover, the top 26 feet of the

 79^ may belong to the uppermost and most local of the three divisions of the
 Series, the Oldhaven Beds, of very rare occurrence in tlie county. The next

 greatest thickness is at Southwold, where the whole has been classed as Reading
 Beds (the persistent division), though here and elsewhere it is possible that the
 underlying Thanet Beds are thinly represented. It is noteworthy that at both
 these places, whei'e the Lower London Tertiaries arc thick, they are also at a
 great depth, beginjiing at '2b2h and 218 feet respectively, which looks as if, like
 the Crag, they thickened in their underground course away from the outcrop.

      The important evidence given by these wells, however, is not as regards thick-
 ness; it is to show the undergi'ound extent of the older Tertiary beds, beneath the
 great sheet of Crag and Drift that prevents them from coming to the surface
 north-eastward from the neighbourhood of Woodbridge. It is clear that over this
 large tract we can know nothing of the beds beneath the Crag otherwise than from
 wells and borings; and, until these were made, our older geologic maps cut oft' the
 older Tertiary beds far south of the parts to which we now know that they reach,

 though hidden from our sight. No one, for instance, would have imagined many

 years ago that at Southwold the Chalk would not be touched till a boring had
  reached the depth of 323 feet, or some 280 below sea-level, or that at Leiston
 those figures would be about 297 and 240.

       It is from calculations based on the levels of the junction of the Chalk and the

 Tertiary beds in many wells that the line engraved on the Geological Survey map

  as the probable boundary of the latter beds under the Crag and Drift has been

 drawn. From what has gone before, however, as to the great irregularitj' in the

  thickness of the Drift, it is clear that this line must be taken only as approximate,
  and open to correction as further evidence is got ; albeit the junction of the Chalk
  and the Tertiary beds is found to be here, as elsewhere, fairly even, along an
  inclined plane that sinks toward the coast.

                                                      Cretaceous Beds.

      Though the Chalk is reached by very many wells, yet we get less information
  about it, by reason of its great thickness. Moreover, the great amount of overlying
  beds in many cases is a bar to deep exploration.
                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  669

Of our SiifiTolk wells tliere are forty which go through 100 feet or more of

Chalk. Of these twenty go through 'iOO feet or more, half of these to 300 or

more, and again half of the ten to 400 or more, a very exact piece of geometric

progression, or more strictly, retrogression. Although two wells pass through

the great thickness of more than 800 feet of chalk, yet neither of them gives us

the full tliicliness of the formation; for the 816 feet at Landguard Fort do not

reach to the base, whilst the 843 (or 817) feet at Combs, near Stowmarket, do not

begin at the top.

As in no case yet recorded has the Chalk been pierced from top to bottom iu

Suffolk (a defect that will be supplied during this meeting by the description of

the Stutton boring), that is to sav, no boring has gone from the overlying older

Tertiar}' beds to the underlying Gault, we must now, therefore, cross the border

of the county to get full ibformation as to the thickness of the Chalk ; and we
have not far to go, for the well-known Harwich boring passes through the whole

of the Chalk, proving a thickness of 890 feet. It is almost certain, indeed, that this

should be given as a few feet more, for the 22 feet next beneath, which have been

described as Gault mixed with Greensand, is probably in part the green clayey

Weglaiiconitic base of the Chalk Marl.  may fairly add for this another 5 feet

("as also in the case of the Combs boring), and may say that, in round numbers, the

Chalk reaches a thickness of about 900 feet in the south-eastern part of Suffolk.

Toward the northern border of the county it is probably more, as the deep boring

at Norwich pa-sses through nearly 1,160 feet of Chalk, and that without beginning

at the top of the formation.

Of our recorded Suffolk wells only three reach the base of the Chalk, at

Mildenhall, Culford and Combs; consequently we have little knowledge of the

divisions of the Chalk. These divisions, indeed, are of comparatively late inven-

tion, having been evolved since the publication of many of the deep sections that

have been referred to.

If the Upper Chalk at Harwich goes as far down as tlie ilints, then we must

allow it to be 690 feet thick, leaving little more than 200 lor the Middle and
Lower C^halk together. At Landguard Fort, from the same point of view, the

Upper Chalk would certainly be 500 feet thick, and one can't say how much

more.

    At Combs, on the other hand, flints have been recorded as present only in the
top 27 feet of the Chalk ; but whilst this may have been owing in part to the

boring having passed between fairly scattered nodules, and in part perhaps to

insufficient care in observation, at Harwich it is possible that some ilints may have
been carried down in the process of boring. It should be remembered, too, that

there are flints in part of the Middle Chalk, so that their presence is not an

unfailing guide.

What evidence we have tends to .show, however, that the Upper Chalk forms

a good deal more than half, and perhaps about two-thirds, of the formation, the

Middle and Low'^r Clialli being rather thin. This agrees with what is found in
other parts where the Chalk is thick, extra thickness being chiefly due to the
highest division. The glauconitic marly bed at the base seems to be well
developed and to be underlain by the Gault clay ; so that we have no good
evidence of the occurrence of Upper Greensand. This division may be thinly

represented at Mildenhall, but it is difficult to classify some of the beds passed

through in the old boring there.

    As far as the Gault is concerned little of course is known ; but that little

pomts to this formation being unusually thin, presumably only 73 feet from top to
bottom at Culford, and probably not more than between 50 and 60 at and near
Harwich. In the north-western part of the neighbouring county of Norfolk it is

well known to be still less, the clay thinning out northward along the outcrop,

until at last there is nothing but a few feet of Red Chalk between the carstone of
the Lower Greensand and the Chalk. The Gault being of much greater thickness
around and under other parts of the London Basin, this thinning in Norfolk and
Suffolk is noteworthy. The absence of the more inconstant Upper Greensand is to
be expected in most places, and calls for no remark ; it may, however, be noted
670 REPORT-- 1895.

tliat geologists are coming to the conclusion that these two divisions are really
parts of one J'ormation, and one result of this geologic wedding is for the in-
constancy of one partner to be greatly compensated by the constancy of the

other.

     The Loiver Greensand has been found in one deep boring only, at Culford, in
the western part of the county, where it is represented by 32i feet of somewhat
exceptional beds. This slight thickness prepares us for underground thinning, and
in the far east of the county the formation is presumably absent, there being no
trace of it at Harwich or at Stutton.

    With the Cretaceous beds we pass from the regular orderly succession of geo-
logic formations ; indeed it may be said that when we reach the base of the Gault
we pass out of the region of facts into the realm of sjieculation.

   We have come then to perbap«i the most iaterestiiig problem in the geology of

the Eastern Counties, to the consideration of the question, What rocks underlie the

Cretaceous beds at great depths ? In dealing with this I must ask your patience

for frequent excursions outside our special district, and sometimes indeed far

away from it.

Beyond the outcrop of the lower beds of the Cretaceous Series in Cambridge-

shire and Norfolk, we find of course a powerful development of the great Jurassic

Series; but the only two recorded deep borings in and near Suffolk that have

pierced through the Cretaceous base, at Culford on the north-west and at Harwich

on the south-east, show not a trace of anything Jurassic: they pass suddenly from

Cretaceous into far older rocks. And here a paper that is to be brought before

you must be anticipated, to a slight extent, by adding that the trial-boring at

Stutton shows just the same thing, the Gault resting directlj' on a much older

rock, which cannot be classed as of Secondary age.

There is no need now to discuss the literature of the old rocks underground in

WeSouth-Eastern England, that has often been done.  may take the knowledge

of what has been shown by the various deep borings as common property, and may

use it freely, without troubling to state the source of each piece of information,

and I will not thei'efore burden this address with references. I had indeed thought

of supplementing a former account by noticing the later litei'ature of the subject;

but decided to spare you from the infliction, and myself from the trouble of inflict-

ing ; though it may be convenient to add, in the form of an Appendix, a list of the

chief papers on the subject that have been published since the question was dis-

cussed at length in 1889, in an official memoir on the geology of London, and to

supply some omissions in tliat work. Nor do I propose to make any special criti-

cism of papers on the subject that have appeared of late years; this is hardly the

occasion for controversy, which mav well be put oft' to a more convenient season.

Some general remarks, however, I shall have to make after putting the facts

before you.

There are 10 deep borings reaching to old rocks in the London Basin, of which

Weaccounts have been published.  find that in 4 of these (Meux's, Streatham,

Ilichmond, and Dover) Jurassic beds separate those rocks from the Cretaceous beds;

so that there are 6 in which these last rest direct on old rocks (Ware, Cheshunt,

Kentish Town, Crossness, Culford, and Harwich). Stutton of course makes a

seventh. The Jurassic rocks occur only in the southern borings, either in London

or still further southward, and in one case only (Dover) is there any considerable

thickness of these : in the other .'J they are from 2>&^ to 87^ feet thick. As far
as regards Suffolk and its borders we may therefore disregard them, except in the
far west, near their outcrop, and we may pass on to consider the older rocks that

have been found.

     So far the occurrence, next beneath the Cretaceous or Jurassic beds, of Silurian,

Devonian, and Carboniferous rocks has been proved, whilst in some cases we are

still doubtful as to the age of the old rocks found. In 5 cases distinctive fossils

have been found (Ware, Cheshunt, Meux's, Dover, and Harwich), but in 5 others
                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.          671

they have not (Kentish Town, Crossness, Richmond, Streatham, and Culford), and

it is in the latter (jroup too that the character of the beds leaves their age in doubt.

So far another must be added to these, as no fossil has yet been found in the old

rocks at Stutton.

Of the above 10 deep borings in the London Basin (usiog that term in the

widest sense, as including the Chalk tract that everywhere surrounds tlie Tertiary

beds) we owe 9 to endeavours to get water from deep-seated i-ocks, and in addition
to these D we have several other deep borings, which though not carried through

to the base of the Secondary rocks, yet c'ive us much inforuiation concerning those

beds (at Ilolkliam, Norwich, Combs, Winkfield, London, Loughton, Chatham, and

Dover). In one case only, that of Dover, lias the work been done for the purpose

of exploration, but now, after a few years' interval, a second trial has been made at

Stutton.

    Now both of these borings were started for a much more definite object than

merely to prove the depth to older rocks, or the thickness of the Cretaceous and

Jurassic Series. There is one particular division of those older rocks that has a

distinct fascination for others than geologists. We, happily, are content to find

anything and to increase our knowledge in any direction, but naturally those who
are not geologists, as well as many uho are, like to find something of immediate

practical value. As already shown, we owe much knowledge of ihe underground

extension of formations to explorations for water ; it has now become the turn of
geologists to help those who would like to find that much less general, though

nearly as needful and certainly more valuable thing, coal.

The first place to suggest itself to those geologists who had worked at this

question, as a good site for trial, was the neighbourhood of Dover, and for various

good reasons. The trial has been made, and successfully, several hundred feet

of Coal Measures having been found, without reaching their base, but with several

beds of workable coal.

Beyond that neighbourhood, however, geologists are not in such accord, and

generally speaking, fairly good re.asons can be given both for and against the

selection of many tracts for trial, except in and near London, where no geologists
would recommend it, from the evidence in our hands.

Let us then shortly review the evidence that we have on the underground

extension of the older rocks in South-Eastern PiUgland, Avith a view of considering

the question of the possibility of finding Coal Measures in any of the folds into
which those rocks have probably, nay almost certainly, been thrown.

The area within which the borings that reach older rocks in the London Basin

is enclosed is an irregular pentagon, from near Dover, on the south-east, to

Richmond on the west, thence to Ware, thence to Culford on the north, thence to

Harwich, and thence southward to Dover, the greatest distance between any

borings beimg from Dover to Culford, about eighty-six miles. It is therefore over

a large tract, extending of course beyond the boundaries sketched above, that

we have good reason to infer that older rocks are within reasonable distance

of the surface, rarely as much as 1 ,G0O feet, and mostly a good deal less.

   We must now consider some evidence outside the tract hitherto dealt with.

Southward of the central and eastern parts of the London Basin we have evidence

that the Lower Cretaceous beds thicken greatly, from what is seen over their

Webroad outcrop between the North and South Downs.          know also, from the

Dover and Chatham borings, that the Upper and Middle Jurassic beds come in to

the south-east, whilst the Sub-Wealden Exploration, near Battle, proves that those

divisions thicken greatly southward, the latter not having been bottomed at the

depth of over ] ,900 feet, at that trial-boring.

Westward, however, near Burford in Oxfordshire, and some miles northward

of the nearest part of the London Basin, Carboniferous rocks have been found at

the depth of about 1,180 feet, these being separated from tbe thick Jurassic beds

(including therein the Liassic and Rb;«tic) by perhaps 420 of Trias. They consist
of Coal Measures, which were pierced to the depth of about 2-30 feet.

In and near Northampton, north-eastward of the last site, and still further

from the northern edge of the London Basin, the like occurs ; but the beds found
                                                                                                                           :

--672 REPORT 1895,

are older than the Coal Measures, and the Trias is thin, not reaching indeed to
90 feet in thickness, and being- absent in one case. At one place, too, the
Carboniferous beds have been pierced through, with a thickness of only 222 feet,

when Old Red Sandstone was found, and in another place still older rock seems to
have been found next beneath the Trias. The depth to the rocks older than the
Trias, where they were reached, was 677, 738, and 790 feet, or respectively
39-5, 460, and 310 below sea-level. Some of these figures must be taken as

somewhat approximate, though they are near enough to the truth for practical

purposes.

   A boring at Bletchley, to the south, reached granitic rocks at the depths of

378| and 401 feet ; but these rocks seem to be only boulders in a Jurassic clay
their occurrence, however, is suggestive of the presence of older rocks at the

surface no great way off, in Middle .Jurassic times.

     Much further northward, at Scarle, south-west of Lincoln, the older rocks

have been reached at the depth of about 1,500 feet, all but 141 of which are Trias,
and they begin with the Permian (which crops out some eighteen miles west-
ward), the Carboniferous occurring after another 400 feet, and liaving been pierced

to 130.

   We have then evidence that over a large part of South-Eastern England,

reaching northward and westward of the London Basin, though the older rocks

are hidden by a thick mantle of Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary beds, yet
they seem to be rarely at a depth that would be called very great by the coal-

miner. They are distinctly within workable depths wherever they have been

reached.

There is no area of old rocks at the surface in our island, south of the Forth,

in which Coal Measures are not a constituent formation. Truly, further north, in the

great tract of  Central  and Northern Scotland there                                               are  no  Carboniferous rocks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but we can hardly say that none ever occurred, at all events in the more southern

Weparts.  know, though, that on the west and north Jurassic and Triassic beds

rest on formations older than the Carboniferous.

     It is not, however, to this more northern and distant tract that we should look
for analogy to our underground plain of old rocks ; rather should we look to more

. southern parts, to Wales and to Central and Northern England, where Coal
  Measures are of frequent occurrence. On the principle of reasoning from the

known to the unknown, I cannot see why we should expect anything but a like

occurrence of Coal Measures, in detached basins, in our vast underground tract of

old rocks.

    What, then, is the evident conclusion from what we know and from what we

may reasonably infer ? Surely that trials should be made to see if such hiddea

coal-basins can be found.

One trial has been made, and it     has  succeeded                                                 the Dover  bo"ing  has  proved
                                                                                                ;

the presence of coal underground in Eastern Kent, along the line between the

ooal-fields of South Wales and of Bristol on the west, and those of Northern

France and of Belgium on the east.

The long gap between the distant outcrops of the Coal Measures near Bristol

and Calais has been lessened very slightly by the working of coal under the

Triassic and Jurassic beds near the former place, but much more by our brethren

across the narrow sea, the extent of the Coal Measures beneath the Jurassic and

Cretaceous beds, having not only been proved by the French and the Belgians

alono- their borders, but the coal bavins: been largely worked. At last, we too

have still further decreased the gap, by the Dover boring, a work that I trust is to

be followed by other work along the same Ime.
    But is this the only line along which we are to search ? Are we to conclude

that the only coal-fields under our great tract of Cretaceous beds (where these are

either at the surface or covered by Tertiary beds) are in Kent, Surrey, and other

counties to the west ? Have we no coal-fields but those of Bristol and of South

Wales? The bounds of our midland and northern coal-fields have been extended

by exploration beneath the New Red Series ; are we to stop here and to assume

that there can be no further underground extension of the Coal Measures south-
                                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                            673

eastward? This seems hardly a wise course, and is certainly a very unenter-

prising one. It seems to me rather that the ri<rht thing to be done is to try to

find out the real state of things, by means of borings.

    There are of course objectors in this as in other matters. Some may say that

it is silly to trj' in Sutt'olk, and that Essex gives a better chance of success.

Others again may prefer Norfolk. And yet others may argue that there is no

chance of finding Coal Measures in any of those three counties. But I must

confess my inability to understand this line of reasoning ; the fact is that the data
we have are few and far between, and that we want more. It is really of little

Weuse to bandy words, and I do not now mean to take up the matter in detail.

cannot get at the truth except by actiuil work; justification by faith will not hold

in this case, still less justification by nnfaitli.
     Let us hark back a little and call to mind what has happened in the past.

I remember the time when certain geologists disbelieved in the possibility of the
occurrence of Coal Measures anywhere in South-Eastern England, it being argued
that the formation thinned out before it could get so far eastward. Then this

view was somewhat varied, and it was inferred, from certain observed facts, that

even if Coal Measures did reach underground into these benighted parts, they

would be without workable coal, and so practically useless.

    Now for some years nothing occurred to upset the prophets of evil, that is to

say, no fact came to light. There were not wanting inferences to the contrarj',
but it remained practically a matter of opinion. One day, however, the needful
fact came, and the first boring made specially to test the question (at Dover)

disproved both the above negative theories by finding Coal Measures with

workable coal. Let us hope that a like result may happen in East Anglia, and

that the pessimists may again be in the wrong.

We Weshould not, however, fall into the opposite error, that of optimism.

Wemust not expect an immediate success like that at Dover.                                                                             are here much

further from any known coal-field. Advertisements of various wares sometimes

Wetell us that ' one trial will suffice,' but it is not so in this case.                                                               should not be

content until many borings have been made, and we should not be despondent if,

after sites have been selected to the best of our judgment, we begin with a set of

borings that are unsuccessful in finding coal.

At the time of writing I cannot say that the Stutton boring is a success or a

failure as far as coal is concerned, but I am quite ready to accept the latter

without being discouraged. Whatever it is you may know during our meeting
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

it is certainly a success in the matter of reaching the old rocks at a depth of less

Wethan 1000 feet.                                                                    should remember that every boring is almost certain to give

us some knowledge that may help in future work.

AThere is a further point, however, to be taken into account.                                                                          boring that

may at first seem to be a faihire, from striking beds older than the Coal Measures,

may some day turn out otherwise. The coal-field along the borders of France

and Belgium is sometimes aflfected by powerful and peculiar disturbances, by

faults of comparatively gentle inclination (far removed from the usual more or less

vertical displacements) which have thrown Coal Measures beneath older beds in
large tracts. This is no mere theory, though advanced as such at first by some

Continental geologists, who have had the great satisfaction of seeing their theory
adopted by practical men, and proved to be true, much coal being worked below

the older beds that have been pushed above the Coal Measures by the overthrust

faults.

Our trial-work, of course, does not yet lead us to consider such disturbances as

Wethose alluded to.                                                                  have at first to assume a normal succession of formations,

and not to carry on explorations in beds that can be proved to be older than the

Coal Measures                                                                        but the time may come when it will be otherwise.
                                                                                  ;

Another matter to which attention has been drawn by our foreign friends is

an apparent general persistence of disturbances along certain lines, or in other
words, the recurrence of disturbances in newer beds in those parts where earlier
movements had afi'ected older beds ; so that, reasoning backward, where
we see marked signs of disturbance for long distances in beds at or near the

surface, there we may expect to find pre-existing disturbances of the older beds
beneath. This, however, is a somewhat controversial question, and much remains
to be done on it ; but should it be proved as a general rule it may have much effect

on our underground coal.

     Finally, the question of the possibility of finding and of working coal in

various parts of South-Eastern England is not merely of local interest ; it is of
national importance. The time must come when tlie coal-fields that we have
worked for years will be more or less exhausted, and we ou<>ht certainly to look
out ahead for others, .so as to be ready for the lessening yield of those that have

served us so well. It is on our coal that our national prosperity largely, one may
say chiefly, depends, and, as far as we can see, will depend. Let us not neglect
any of the bounteous gifts of nature, but let us show rather that we are ready to
search for the treasures that may be hidden under our feet, and the finding of

which will result in the continued welfare of our native land.

   --The following Papers were read :

1. The Southern Character of the Molluscan Fauna of the CoraUiyie Crag
    tested by an analysis of its characteristic and abundant species. By

    F. W. Haemer, F.G.S.

     Out of 436 species of Mollusca from the Coralline Crag, excluding varieties
given in Mr. Searles Wood's monograph, nearly 90 are represented by unique
specimens only, and more than 100 others are very rare. Some of these rarer
forms may be only locally so, although, with few exceptions, all the species which
are common in the Belgian Pliocene beds, of similar age to the Coralline Crag,

are common also in that deposit. An analysis of all the shells in any horizon of

the Crao- in which the same value is attached to forms which are exceedinglj' rare,
and to those which occur in countless profusion, is apt to be, to some extent, mis-
leading. The Southern character of the fauna of the Coralline Crag, and its close
resemblance to that of the Mediterranean, is much more strongly evidenced when

we confine our enquiry to the more abundant shells of this deposit.
     Omitting the rare species, we have 240 which may be I'egarded as characteristic

forms. Of these 89, or about 37 per cent., are regarded by Mr. Wood as extinct,

and eight others may be, for our present purpose, taken as such, as they have
ceased to exist in European seas, and are only found in parts of the vvorld more or
less distant. Of the 143 species remaining, there is only one, liiiccinum {Biiccin-
opsis) Dalei, which is not now found living, either in the Alediterranean or the

West European area, which Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys said cannot be regarded as zoolo-

gically distinct from it. This shell cannot, however, be looked on as a boreal
species, as it is given by M. DoUfus as occurring in the Miocene beds of Touralne.
Thirty-three of the extinct shells of the Coralline Crag are also found in the Medi-
terranean Pliocene, either at Monte Mario, or Biot, near Antibes. Altogether 170

species out of 396 found at Monte Mario are common to that deposit and to the

Coralline Crag, a larger proportion than is the case with the Diestien beds of Bel-

gium. The practical identity thus shown between the Molluscan fauna of the
Coralline Crag, and that of the Mediterranean and West European province, and
the close resemblance bytween both of them and some of tlie Italian Pliocenes,
point to a more direct and open communication between the Mediterranean and
the seas of Great Britain at .some period subsequent to the coming into existence

of the present fauna than exists at present.
      The distinctly Southern character of the Mollusca of the Coralline Crag is evi-

denced by the comparatively small proportion of the species which range north-

wards into British waters, and this also comes out more strongly when we confine
ourselves to its more abundant forms. While there is only one which is British,

and not Southern, there are 42, or 29 per cent., of the European species which
are Southern and not British. There are, however, nine shells which are charac-
teristic Mediterranean species, and are only included in lists of the British Mol-
lusca because of the occasional discover}' ot some rare specimen on our coasts. If

we regard these nine species as Mediterranean, it raises the proportion of exclu-

sively Southern forms to 36 per cent. The abundant shells are practically all
Southern, and if it were possible to count shells, and not species, we should meet

                                                                                   XX 2

with some thousands of specimens of Southern MoUusca for every boreal shell we
could discover. Among the extinct g-enera. a study of the more abundant forms
also shows an equal preponderance of Southern types. Only one specimen of a
truly Arctic shell, viz., Cerithiopais lactea, has been met with in the Coralline Crag,

but as to its correct identification Mr. Wood had considerable doubt.

     Professor Prestwich, on the contrary, believes that ice action had come into
existence even at the commencement of the Coralline Crag era, resting his opinion

on the occurrence of a block of porphyry in the basement bed at Sutton, which,
however, was neither angular nor striated, but which he thinks could only have

been transported either from Scandinavia or the Ardennes by floating ice. No

ice, however, reaches our shores at the present day either from Belgium or Norway,
and the winter climate of Northern Europe would have to fall considerably before

this could take place. At present there is a difference of not less than 10° Fabr.

between the temperature, both of the sea and the atmosphere, in the British and

Mediterranean areas.

2. On the Derivative Shells of the Bed Crag} By F. W. Harmer, F.G.S.

    It has been generally held by geologists, among whom may be mentioned

Mr. Searles V. Wood, Professor Prestwich, Sir Charles Lyell, and Mr. Charles-
worth, that a considerable number of the MoUusca found in the Red Crag are
extraneous. Mr. Wood, in the supplement to his well-known Monograph,
expresses the opinion that 118 species have been derived from older deposits,
principally from the Coralline Crag. Professor Prestwich thinks that only 46
species are derivative, but his list contains 13 which Mr. "Wood, on the contrary,
believes are Red Crag forms.

     There seems much, a priori, to support the ^derivative theory. The great
denudation to which the Coralline Crag has been exposed by the Red Crag sea;

the existence over a great part of the area of the Nodule bed, Avhich is full of

derivative   fossils                              and  the  fact                                                     that   many of                         the  shells  supposed  to  be  extraneous
                                               ;

as, for example, Cassidfiria bicatenata, Troplwn alveolatus, Cams Saburon, Tiochus

Adansoni, liinf/iculu buccinea, Cardifa chamrrformis, C. orbicularis, C. scalaris,

Astarte Bnsterotii, A. Burtinii, A. Omalii, L'yprina riistica, Gastrana laminosa,

Panopcea Faiijasii, and others, are characteristic Coralline Crag species, and either

southern or extinct fornrs, which seem out of place in a fauna as boreal as that of

the Red Crag.

On the other hand, M. E. van den Uroeck, of Brui-sels, publislied in 1893 lists of

fossils recently discovered in the Scaldisien and Poederlien beds of Antwerp

(Zones ';\ Trnplwn antiQuinn,' and 'a. Corbida striata^), from which it appears

that the species ju-t named, and a number of other forms suppo-i' I to be derivative

in the Red Crag, lived on to a period considerably later than tiinr of the Coralline

Crag, in the eiistern part of the Anglo- Belgian basin. The fauna of the Scaldisien

beds closely resembles that of the Walton Crag, while the Poederlien strata seem

to be more nearly related lo the Sutton zone of the Red Crag. Neither of ihese

Belgian horizons contains the purely Arctic shells, Cardium [jrcenlandicum, Leda

lanceolata, and Tellina lata, or the Arctic and boreal species, Hcalaria grcenlandica,

Natica granlandica,ixnA. Nntica clausa, wluch give its peculiarly iiorthern character

to the Butley Crag, so that it would seem that they are somewhat older than that

deposit. Fifty out of Mr. Wood's list of 118 species, and 23 out of 40 regarded by

Professor Prestwich as extraneous, occur in these horizons of the Belgian Crag. If

these shells were living during the deposition of the Sutton bed, it seems more

probable that a few individuals may have survived until the period of the Butley

Crag than that they are derivative at that horizon.

Some of the Red Crag shells, however, are no doubt extraneous. Five are

Eocene forms, which are not found in the Coralline Crag ; and there are 31 others

which have been discovered only at Waldringfield or in the Nodule bed at Sutton,

and neither in the Belgian nor the Coralline Crag, many of them being new to

science, and most of them repre-'ented by unique specimens only.

Although a great number of fossils, such as sharks' teeth, from Eocene strata

are found in the Red Crag, very few specimens of Eocene MoUusca occur in it

and it seems still less likely that shells from the Coralline Crag, which are very
much more fragile, could have been preserved, except as rare exceptions, during

the denudation of that deposit by the Red Crag sea.

     The characters and thickness-es of the strata representing the several zones at

these places were carefully detailed, and their most characteristic Foraminifera

were enumerated and compared. V. The ' nodule-bed' at the base of the Crag, at

Foxhall, was alluded to in its place. VI. The Lenbam Beds of Kent were noticed

as being equivnlent to the Lower Crag and of Diestian age, aa stated by Prestwich

and confirmed by C. Reid.

    Some Foraminifera found by S. V. Wood in the Coralline Crag at Sutton and

elsewhere were derived from nuieh older Tertiary beds, namely, Orbitolit.es,

Orbiculina, Alveolina, Peiieroplis, Amphistegina, Nummulites, and Orbitoides.

Tbemost characteristic Foraminiferiu the Coralline Crag is Pulymorpinnafrondi-

formu, and it seems to be limited to England. The conclusions arrived at point

to the constancy and determinability of the zones established by Prestwich. In

the author's opinion the Mollusca also confirm the same zonal arrangement. Some

remarks on the zonal and local distribution of several genera and species of Mollusca

concluded this paper.

4. Note on a section at the North Cliff, Southwold. By Horace B,
    Woodward, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of England and Wales.

     The recent damage done to the cliff at the north end of Southwold by the

' moderate gale ' of last May is described below by Mr. J. Spiller. One result of

the storm was the exposure of an interesting section along the lower portion of the
cliflf. The strata now seen comprise pebbly sands and shingle with a shell-bed,
grouped by the author with the Norwich Crag; several masses of Chalky Boulder
Clay, which formerly extended in one mass along the face of the cliff; a
Freshwater Bed, consisting of gi'eenish grey loam with freshwater shells and lawyers
of gravel cemented into ' iron-pan,' overlaid by laminated peaty earth (age at
present uncertain) ; and a liecent beach-deposit in which a human skeleton was
found this 3'ear. This beach-deposit, which now forms part of the low clifl', con-
sists of reassorted Boulder Clay, together with sand and shingle. The Fresliwater
Bed presents a synclinal structure, supported on either side b}' Boulder Clay.

              5. On Recent Coast Erosion at Southwohl and Covehithe.
                                  By John Spiller, F.C.S.

Owing to the prevalence of northerly winds, culminating in a moderate gale on

May 16 last, th^ tide rose to an unusual height all along the east coast, and attacked

the soft sandy cliff's between hunwich and Covebithe, creating a new cove at the

northern extremity of Southwold and sweeping away the roadway at the back of

the beach to the extent of half an acre at this particular spot. The cliffs at Easton

Bavent.i and Covehithe likewise suffered considerably, and this loss being reported

to Mr. W. "NVhitaker induced that gentleman to lend his maps with certain

measurements noted thereon for the purpose of exact comparison. Thus provided

the author walked over the ground and took fresh measurements at the several

points along the route, which resulted in the determination of the amount of clitl-
--waste since 1882 and 188U, and this stated briefly was as follows :
          ......Easton Bavents, loss in six years
                                                                                                                    Feet

          Easton High Cliff, loss in thirteen years                                                                 20

          ......Covehithe Cliff, loss in six _years                                                                 22
                                                                                                                    84

    The accuracy of these observations was cheeked by Mr. Horace B. Woodward,

and other indications observed conjointly proved that the general loss at Covehithe

amounted to about 60 yards since the present Ordnance map was constructed.

Ilie lines of hi.o-h and low water niarlc bad manifestly altered, so that a fresh

survey was necessary. Further details were given as to the nature of the rock

sections laid bare  and  the  transportation of the  shingle                                     and the main facts were

                     6. Observations on East Anglian Boulder Clay.

                           By Rev. E. Hill, M.A., F.G.S.

     Some personal observations are described, and inferences from them suggested.
     The present effect of frost on clay shows that the grinding- actions of laud-ice

need not be invoked.
     The comparative distributions of Kimmeridge clay and chalk, and also the

intimate mixture of chalk-fragments with clay-matrix, are opposed to laud-ice

theories.

   A partially scratched fragment from the heart of the clay suggests flotation.

     The contour line of 300 feet includes little Chalk but much lioulder Clay, which

is said to reach altitudes in the Midlands higher than any Cbalk. This points to
alteration in relative as well as absolute levels.

   A resemblance to some artificial clays suggests that the Boulder Clay may have

been deposited rather rapidly. If so, the absence of life is no difhculty ; neither is
the alleged absence of stratification.

     These inferences would all agree with deposition in water, and with a tilt of

the earth-surface.

7. Indications of Ice-raft Action through Glacial Times.

               By Rev. E. Hill, M.A., F.G.S.

Over post-Glacial gravels lie sheets of Boulder Clay. In the Boulder Clay

scratched stones, contorted sands at Sudburv, gravel and chalk at Claydon, the

Roslyn Hill chalk at Ely, are best explained by transportation and dropping. In

mid-Glacial sands, between Gorleston and Lowestoft, portions of Boulder Clay

Aoccur in the midst of the sands, as if dropped by ice-rafts.                                    majority of writers

on the Cromer cliffs attribute the chalk masses in the Contorted Drift to ice-

rafts.

     Thus through Glacial times are indications of ice-raft action.

                      8. On Traces of an Ancient Watercom-se.
                            By Rev. E. Hill, M.A., F.G.S.

   A peculiar gravel occurring along a line of seven miles indicates an ancient

brook. Though its hollow is in Boulder Clay, yet patches of like clay overlie the
gravel, and probably have been carried down on to it in a frozen state. The
nature of the gravel agrees with its having been formed on land little elevated.

     9. Further Notes on the Arctic and Pala'olithic Deposits at Iloxne.

By Clement Reid, F.L.S., F.G.S., and H. N. Ridley, JLA., F.L.S.

     The exact relations of the deposit with Arctic plants discovered in 1888 (see
British Association Report, p. G74) to the Palreolithic deposits and to the Boulder
Clay in the same pit being still uncertain, the authors returned last spring, intending
to pump out the water and examine the beds in place. This they were unable to
do owing to the water being required for the brickyard ; but by means of borings

succession was probably as follows

      The authors suggest the appointment of a committee to continue this work, as
. Hoxne is apparently the best locality in the I'^asteru Counties for ascertaining the
 relation of Palieolitliic man to the Glacial epoch. The seeming occurrence of a
 temperate flora between the morainic deposits and the clays with Arctic plants
 should also be investigated and decided beyond question.

               FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13.

The following Papers and Reports were read :

1. On Pitch Glaciers or Poissiers. By Professor W. J. SoLLAS, D.Sc, F.R.S.

Pitch and the ice of glaciers strikingly resemble each other in behaving as

solids and liquids, according to their manner of treatment. On the sudden appli-

cation of force they break like brittle material, but yield like fluids when subjected

to gradual pull or pressure. Hence it is possible to employ pitch in the construction

of working models of glaciers in order to obtain an insight into those internal

movements of actual glaciers which are beyond the reach of direct observation.
The study of glacial deposits has shown that many erratic boulders were transported

during the Glacial period upwards from lower to higher levels, and left stranded on

the flanks of mountains some hundreds of feet above their source. This standing

difficulty in the way of physical theories of glacier movement has been explained

by the study of pitch models, which show that the lower layers of material on

approaching an obstacle are carried upwards in an ascending current. The

inference, which is confirmed by other lands of observation, is that similar move-

ments take place in actual glaciers. Further, a glacier sometimes overrides its

terminal moraine without disturbing it ; and in one experiment this was exempli-

fied, for pitch flowed for several months over a ridge of loose material without

Aremoving a particle of it.  remark made by Professor Fitzgerald, to the effect

that viscosity seemed merely to retard, and not to alter, the nature of the move-

ment in the cases described led the author to experiment with less viscous material,

Asuch as Canada balsam and glycerine, and with concordant results.  trough

containing Canada balsam flowing upwards over an obstacle under its own head of

pressure was shown by the lantern projected on the screen.

   A raised model of Ireland has been constructed, and the directions of ice-

movement, as determined by the Rev. Maxwell Close, indicated upon it by
                                                                                                                                 :

arrows. On allowing water streaked with colouring matter to flow over it from
two areas, supposed to represent tlie great gathering grounds of snow of the Glacial
period, the water had taken paths, as shown by coloured streaks, corresponding to

those taken by the ice, as shown by the arrows.

2. Fotes on the Cromer Excursion. By Clement Reid, F.G.S.

3 On the Tertiary Lacustrine Formations of North America.
                           By W. B. Scott.

     The early French explorers in the western parts of North America discovered
certain large areas of e.xtraordinarily broken and difficult country which thej-^
called 'mauvaises terres a traverser'-- a term which has been translated and
shortened into the modern phrase 'bad lands.' Geological examination soon
showed that these areas were covered with fres^h-water deposits of Tertiary age, and
that they represented a .series of great lakes in which were entombed a vast

number of representatives of the vertebrate faunas which successively occupied the

country.

     I. (1) The most ancient of these formations is the Puerco, which overlies with_

apparent conformity the Cretaceous. This rather small lake occupies parts of

Southern Colorado and North-western New Mexico. (2) The Wasatch succeeds
after an interval and was much larger : it extends from New Mexico into Northern

Wyoming. At least two contemporaneous lakes represent this horizon, and at the
south its strata lie upon the Puerco. (3) The Bridger is indicated by a much

smaller series of lakes, in W^yoniing, Utah, and Colorado, which seem to have been

successive rather than contemporaneous, and has been divided into tliree stages

(a) Wind Puver, (6) Bridger, {c) Wasliakie. The Wasatch beds pass under the

Bridger at very many points. (4) Extensive orographic movements followed^ the
Bridger stage and led to the formation of a new lake basin in Northern Utah,

--overlying the Bridger the Uinta. Osborn has shown that two distinctly marlied

horizons occur within the limits of the Uinta. (5) The Uinta was the last of the

great bodies of fresh water in the region to the west of the main chain of the

Rocky Mountains. The movements now affected the Great Plains region, and an

enormous lake was developed which extended along the eastern front of the

moimtains from Nebraska into North Dakota, together with a second basin in

Canada. This is the White l\iver formation, which is plainly subdivisible into

--three horizons the I'itanotherium, Oreodon, and Protoceras beds. (G) This was

followed by the Jolm Day, which is mostly confined to Oregon, but a second

Avery smalf basin occurs also in Central Montana. (7)                                              considerable hiatus

separates the .lohn Day from the overlying Loup Fork, which is by far the niost

extensive of all the Tertiary lakes, and covers nearly all the Plains region, fiota

South Dakota far into Mexico. It is not yet certain whether this was one vast

body of water or a connected series of lakes. Independent basins occur in Montana,

Nevada, and Oregon. In these the Loup Fork overlies the John Day unconform-

ably, as farther east it overlies the White River. The Loup Fork falls naturally

into three horizons, separated both by their faunas and more or less marked uncon-

formities :  {a)  Deep  River, only in  Montana                                               {b)  Nebraska, the principal area  pf
                                                                                           ;

the Plains region (e) Palo Duro, known in Kansas, but principally developed in
                                                                                                  ;

Texas. (8) In the Indian territory and Texas, in places overlying the Palo Duro,

occurs the Blanco, the boundaries of which have not been traced as yet. (9)

Occupying the surface of most of the Great Plains region are the uncompacted and

obscurely stratified Equus beds, which re.st unconformably upon all other forma-

tions of the region, from the Cretaceous to the Pliocene.
     II. The Lacustrine beds have for the most part retained their horizontal

position, only rarely being tilted. They are composed of felspathic muds, clays,
sands, and conglomerates, generally cemented by some calcareous compound, and
682 REPORT-- 1895.

their hardness is, speaking broadly, proportionate to their antiquity. The removal
of the soluble cement by rain-water causes the rock to crumble, and the bad lands
are examples of atmospheric erosion on a very grand scale. This erosion is
extremely slow, the soil shedding the rain almost completely, but land-slips and
snow avalanches in the spring frequently expose fresh surfaces of rock. The John
Day beds are largely composed of the glassy particles of volcanic ash and the whole
is overlaid by late basaltic flows.

    In the lake basins the old shore lines and deltas may frequently be traced, and

their fossil contents sometimes afford interesting hints as to the habitat of the land
animals.

      Climatic changes are registered in the alteration of the floras, as in the gradual
disappearance of the palms from the central latitudes and in the diminution in the
abundance and variety of the reptiles. For example, large crocodiles are exceed-

ingly common in all the Eocene formations, including the Uinta, but in the
succeeding White lliver only a few dwarf forms have been found.

     III. The correlation of formations in different continents is a difficult matter,
but least so, perhaps, in the case of lacustrine beds in coiviected areas. The Old

and New Worlds were certainly so connected during much, if not all, of Tertiary

time, and there is always a certain proportion of land mammals common to the
two continents. The natural and sharply marked lines of division are, however,
not the same, and vpere the American formations arranged without reference to

those of any other continent, a system very different from the European would re-
sult. Thus the Puerco would form one group; the Wasatch a second; the
Bridger, White River, and John Day a third ; the Loup Fork and Blanco a fourth

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and the Equus beds a fifth.
     The European system is, however, the standard, and must be employed, and

even in this way some very close correspondences may be noted. Thus, the

Puerco is somewhat older than the Ceruaysian, while the Wasatch is the exact
equivalent of the Suessonian. The Bridger is Middle Eocene (Parisian or Lute-
tian), and the Uinta in a general way corresponds to the I'aris gypsum. The
White lliver is Oligocene (Ronzon), and much misunderstanding has come from
calling it Miocene. The John Day may be placed in the Lower Miocene, though it
is somewhat older than the bed's at St. t.T6raud-le-Puy, and follows the White
River epoch with hardly a break.

     None of the American lacustrines is referable to the Middle Miocene. The
Loup Fork is Upper Miocene, the Deep River division corresponding almost exactly
to the beds of Sausan and Steinheira, while the Palo Duro division is perhaps
already basal Pliocene. The fauna of the Blanco series is not yet sufficiently well
known for exact correlation, though there can be no doubt that it is Pliocene.

      The Equus beds are distinctly Pleistocene, though it still remains to trace their
 relations to the Drift and to determine whether they are pre-Glacial or Glacial.

      4. The Glacial Age in Tropical America. By R. Blake White.

      The deposits described by the author cover almost the whole of the Republic
 of Colombia, extending from 12° N. lat. nearly to tlie Equator, and from the
 summits and plateaux of the Andes at 10,000 and 12,000 feet down to the plains,
 valleys, and littorals of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Glacial age corre-

 sponded, in his opinion, with tliat of greatest volcanic activity. He speaks of

 moraines from 2,000 to 3,000 feet thick, accumulation of boulders, erratics of
 enormous size, and a peculiar loess on the high lands, the last containing bi-
 pyramidal crystals of quartz supposed to have been formed in situ. Great
 denudation followed the melting of the ice, and the auriferous deposits of the
 country belong to this or to the Glacial age. The author considers that a decrease
 in temperature enough to bring the snow line from 2,000 to .3,000 feet lower than
 it is at present would account for the phenomena which he describes. This might
 be brought about by a diminution of the amount of carbonic acid in the atmosphere,

   producing rarefaction. He concludes by urging geologists to investigate a country

   which offers such a promisin;,'' field, and does not present to the traveller any

   difficulties of importance.

   5. On pre-Glacial Valleys in Northamptonshire. By Beeby Thompson,

                                                       F.C.S., F.G.S.

        The paper refers to the pretty general belief that the larger physiographical
   features of this country were developed before the Glacial period, and that many
   of the present river valleys are of pre-Glacial age; and remariis that, if so, they
   were more or less completely choked with boulder clay during tlie Glacial

   period.

        Where a valley got completely filled up it would, perhaps, in many cases be
   easier for the ordinary drainage to cut out a new valley than to remove the in-
   filling of an old one, where the initiative for a new valley had been given by

   superficial streams due to melting ice. So at the close of the Glacial period,
   although the main drainage of a district must take approximately the same direc-
   tion that it did before it, the tributary streams would seldom accurately follow
   their old lines on having, as it were, a i'resli start under somewhat difi'erent cir-
   cumstances. Compromises would, no doubt, frequently result.

        Bearing these matters in mind, we should be prepared to find

            1. New valleys without drift, and filled-up old ones near at hand.

              '2. Valleys witli one side drift and the other the normal rocks of the

                               district.

            3. Valleys still containing much drift, with the streams running over or

                       · through it.
              4. Valleys in which only the coarser material of the drift is left in the

                       form of river gravel.

        Illustrations of each of the four cases enumerated are given, all from Northamp-

   tonshire.

        The author suggests that his explanation of some isolated patches of boulder
   clay near to Northampton may prove to be of more general application than pre-

   viously suspected.

   6. Notes on some Tarns near Snoivdon. By W. W. Watts, M.A., F.G.S.

   During a recent visit to Snowdon, the writer has taken the opportunity of

   examining a few of the tarns in its immediate vicinity. These include the two

   Cwmsmall lakes in  Glas, Glaslyn, a"nd Llyn Llydaw.

   In the hollow of Cwm Glas tbere are two tiny tarns named Ffynnon Freeh

   and Ffynnon Felen ; both lakes drain over a barrier of rock, but in a rainy season

   the upper one appears to find a second outlet over the long, low col to the East,

   so that, in this state, it has the two outlets depicted in the 6-inch map. There

   can be little doubt that this upper lake is a portion of a bending valley dammed at

   both ends by scree- and stream-debris, and thus compelled to find an escape over

   the rocky side. The lower lake is certainly contined in a rock basin, as rock occurs

   at its actual outlet and at everjj point where any former outlet might have been

   possible. The lake is, however, so shallow that its occurrence in a basin of rock is

   perhaps of little consequence.

   CwmThe neighbouring hollow of   Dyli, as is well known, contains three lakes,

   the highest being Glaslyn, the next Llyn Llydaw, and the lowest Llyn Teyrn.

   Glaslyn is bounded on all sides by live rock except at and near its outlet. This

   exit is over morauie, which, however, is evidently not very deep, for rock makes

   its appearance just below, and in such a way as to almost compel belief in a com-

   plete rock bar. Beside the present course of the effluent stream is a parallel strip

of moraine running down towards Llyn Llydaw, but living rock soon makes its
appearance in this in such a way as to show that if there is any old channel in this
direction it must be exceedingly narrow and tortuous. Thus, if this lake is not
contained in a true rock basin, it must be very shallow or else must have found
exit by a gorge quite as narrow as those found at the end of some of the Swiss

glaciers.

     Immense quantities of moraine material occur on the south-east side of Llyn
Llydaw, but a careful examination of tlie map and the ground shows that only

--two possible outlets exist that now used for this purpose, and a second which is

occupied by bog resting on moraine, and gives rise to a small stream which is joined
lower down by the outlet of Llyn Teyrn. The moraine is, however, only a thin
skin on the surface of rock. The present outlet shows live rock forty or fifty feet
below the level of the lake, and the second possible exit at a rather less distance
below the same level. If the moraine were stripped off, there is little doubt that
this lake, like Glaslyn, would show a basin of rock which would hold water, unless

it is very much shallower than is generally supposed to be the case.

           By Percy F. Kendall, F.O.S., and 3. Lomas, A.R.C.Sc.

     The authors have spent several weeks during the present summer among the
glaciers of the Nicolaithal and the Val Tournanche, and have paid especial
attention to the form and distribution of glacial strise. The present communication
deals with four principal sets of phenomena.

   --1. The Crossinrj of Two or tiiore Sets of Strice. In the discussion of the

glacial geology of Britain and other countries writers have ascribed the formation
of two superposed sets of strine on one surface either to the action of floating ice
or to a diftereut period of glaciation. The authors have found that the phenomenon
is of quite general occurrence, especially on the 'steeply inclined ' weather '-sides
of roc/tes moutonnees. They have observed an angular divergence of 89°.

  --2. The Forms of Strice as a Means of determining the Direction of Ice-

movement. It is often impossible to decide a priori whether a particular scratch
or set of scratches was produced by ice moving, say, from south to north, or from
north to south. The late Professor Carvill Lewis thought that .striae having a
broad and a narrow end would furnish reliable criteria, but the authors, after
careful examination of a large number, are unable to regard such characters as
possessing the required degree of constancy.
--

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  685

   --3. The Phenomena known to Ainen'can Glacialists as ' Semilunar Markings,^

' Pluck-marks,'' and " Chattered Strice.' The authors found many examples of these
features of glacial abrasion upon roches moutonnees. The ' pluck-uiarks ' were

found to be shallowest at their ' downstream ' ends. ' Chattered strire,' i.e., ragged
strife presenting somewhat the appearance of a succession of bruises, were very
common. They were probablj' produced by boulders that were onlj' partially
embedded in the ice, and were thus dragged along with a jerking motion.

     It is satisfactory that these minor details of the glacial phenomena of the United
States can be paralltled in the Alps.

  --4. The Occurre7ice of 'Screwed' or Curved Stride. Authors have ascribed the

formation of sharply curved or screwed striae to the swinging of floating ice when
partly aground. The present writers have observed and recorded by heel-ball
' rubbings' and by photography many e.\amples occurring on the i-oches moutonnees

of the Gorner Glacier.

               13. Notes on the Ancient Physiography of South Essex.

                                    By T. V. Holmes.

     The author refers to bis paper, read before the Geological Society last year, en-
titled, ' Further Notes on some Section'^ on the Ne.ic Railway from Romford to Up-
minster, and on the Relations of the Thames Valley Bedsto the Boulder Clay.' In
that paper he mentioned the discovery, in a railway cutting at Romford, of part of
an ancient silted- up stream course of considerable size, covered by gravel belonging
to the highest, and presumably oldest, terrace of the Thames Valley system. In
this communication he considers more fully the evidence bearing upon his view
that the course taken by this ancient stream was between the high ground of
Warley, Billericay, and Maldon, and that of Laindon, Rayleigh, and Althorne
into tlie Blackwater, the basins of the Mardyke and Crouch having originated at a

much later period. He also notes evidence tending to confirm Mr. Whitaker's view

that the gravel and loam at and near Canewdon, Southminster, and Brad well were
deposited on the western flank of the old Thames Valley when there was a con-
siderable breadth of land east of those places, which has been since removed by

marine denudation.

1. Restorations of some European Dinosaurs, icith Suggestions as to their

           Place among the Reptilia. By Professor O. C. Marsh.

     For several years I have been engaged in investigating the Dinosaurs of North
America, where these extinct reptiles were very abundant during the whole of

Mesozoic time. The results of my study have been published from time to time,

and 1 have already had the honour of presenting some of these to the British
As«ociation. In carrying out this investigation so as to include the whole group
of Dinosaurs, wherever found, and bringing all under one system of classification,

it ha? been necessary for me to study the remains di-'covered in Europe, and I
have made several visits to this country for that purpose.

     In comparing the forms known from the two continents, certain important
differences as well as some marked resemblances between the two have been

observed and placed on record. In concluding my investigations of the North
686 REPORT-- 1895.

American forms, I have fortunately been able to make restorations of the skeletons
of quite a number of very complete type specimens, and ibis has proved a most
instructive means of comparinfr those from dili'erent horizons, and of diiferent

groups, among the known Dinosauria of A merica.

     The success of this plan rendered it ver}' desirable to extend it, if possible, to
the best-known forms of European Dinosaurs. This I have been enabled to do in
a few instances, and the main object of the present paper is to lay these latest

results before you.

                              Eestoeations of Etjeopean Dinosaurs.

     The restorations of Dinosaurs which I have to present are four in number,
and represent some of the best-known European forms, types of the genera
Compsognathus, Scelidosaurus, Hypsilnphodon, and lyiumodon. These outline

restorations have been prepared by me maiuh' for comparison with the correspond-

inof American forms, but in part to insure, so far as the present opportunity will
allow, a more comprehensive review of the whole group. The specimens restored
are all of great interest in ihemselves, and of special importance when compared
with their nearest American allies.

                   Compsognathus.

The first restoration, that of Compsognathus longipes, Wagner, 1861, shown

natural size in the diagram, is believed to represent fairly well the general form

and natural position, when alive, of this diminutive carnivorous Dinosaur, that

lived during the .Jurassic period. The basis for this restoration is (1) a careful
study of the type specimen itself, made by me in Munich in 1881 (2) an accurate

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

cast of this specimen, sent to me by Prof, von Zittel ; and (.3) a careful drawing of

the original made by Krapf in 1887. The original description and figure of
Wagner (Bavarian Academy of Sciences, 1861) and those of later authors have
also been used for some of the details. No restoration of the skeleton of this

unique Dinosaur has hitherto been attempted.'

Compsognathus has been studied by so many anatomists of repute since its

discovery that any attempt to restore the skeleton to a natural position will be

Myscrutinised from various points of view.  interest in this unique specimen led

me long ago to examine it with care, and I have since made a minute study of it,

as related elsewhere, not merely to ascertain all I could about its anatomy, but

also to learn, if possible, what its relations were to another diminutive form,

Hallopus, from a lower horizon in America, which has been asserted to be a near
ally. Both are carnivorous Dinosaurs, probably, but certainly on quite different

lines of descent.

     The only previous attempt to restore this remarkable Dinosaur was by Huxley,

when in America in 1876. He made a rapid sketch from the Wagner figure, and
I had this enlarged for his New York lecture. This sketch, reproduced on the

diagram exhibited, represents the animal sitting down, a position which such

Dinosaurs occasionally assumed, as shown by the footprints in the Connecticut
Valley, which Huxley examined in place at several localities with great interest.

    The great majority of Dinosaurian footprints preserved were evidently made

during ordinary locomotion, although some series show evidence of more rapid

movement. All those referred to carnivorous Dinosaurs are bipedal, and this is

true of the footprints of many herbivorous forms.

In the present restoration of Compsognathus, I have tried to represent the

animal as walking, in a characteristic lifelike position.

     ' The remains of the embryo within the skeleton of Compsognathxos, first detected
bv me in 1881, while examining the type specimen, are not represented in the pre.sent
restoration. This unique fossil affords the only known evidence that Dinosaurs were

viviparous.

                                                            Scelidosawus.

     The second of these restorations is that of Scelidosaurus Ilarrisonii, of Owen,
shown natural .size in the diagram. This reptile was an herbivorous Dinosaur of
moderate size, related to Stegosaurus, and was its predecessor from a lower geologi-
cal horizon in England. This restoration is essentially based upon the orio-inal
description and figures of Owen (Palteontographical Society, 1861). These have
been supplemented by mj' own notes and sketches, made during examinations of
the type specimen, now in the British Museum.

     Scelidosaurus is a near relative, as it were, of one of our American forms,

Stegosnurus, now represented by so many specimens that we know the skull,
skeleton, and dermal armour, with much certaintj'. Tlie English form known as
Omosawus is still more nearly allied to Stegosaurus, perhaps identical.

   A restoration of the skeleton of Scelidosaurus, by Dr. Henry 'vVoodward, will

be found in the British Museum Guide to Geology and Palaeontology, 1890, p. 19.
The missing parts are restored from Iguanodon, and the animal is represented as

bipedal, as in that genus.

     In the present outline restoration of Scelidosaurus, I have endeavoured merely

to place on record my idea of the form and position of the skeleton, when the

animal was alive, based on tlie remains I have myself examined. In case of doubt,

as, for example, in regard to the front of the skull, which is wanting in the type
specimen, I have used a dotted outline, based on the nearest allied form. Of the

dermal armour, only the row of plates best known is indicated. The position chosen
in this figure is one that would be assumed by the animal in walking on all four
feet, and this I believe to have been its natural mode of progression.

           Hypsilopliodon.

The third of these restorations, that of Hypsilophodon Fo.vii. Huxlev, 1870

given in outline, natural size, in the diagram, has been made with much care

partly from the type specimen, and in part from other material mostly now in the

British Museum. The figures and description by the late Mr. flulke ' were of

special value, although my own conclusions as to the natural position of the animal
when alive do not coincide with those of my honoured friend, who did so much to

make tliis genus of Dinosaurs, and others, known to science. The restoration by
Mr. Ilulke is shown in another diagram.

In the case of I£gpsilopkodo>i, a number of specimens are available instead of

only one. This makes the problem of restoration in itself a simpler matter than in

Scelidosaurus. Moreover, we have in America a closely allied form, Laosaurus, of
Awhich several species are known.
                                   study of the genus Laosaurus, and the

restoration of one species given on the diagram exhibited will clear up several points
long in doubt.

     Huxley and Hulke both .shed much light on this interesting genus, Hi/psilo-
jyhodon, indeed, on many of the Dinosauria. The mystery of the Dinosaurian
pelvis, which bafiled Cuvier, Mautell, and Owen, was mainly solved by them, the
ilium and ischium by Pluxley, and the pubis by Hulke. The more perfect
American specimens have demonstrated the correctness of nearly all their ccn-

clusions.

                                   Iffuanodon.

The fourth restoration exhibited, that of Iguanodon Bernissartensis, Boulen^er,

1881, one-fifth natural size, has been made in outline for comparison with American

forms. It is based mainly on photographs of the well-known Belgian specimens

the originals of which I have studied with con.siderable care during several visits

to Brussels. The descriptions and figures of Dollo - have also been used in the
Apreparation of this restoration.
                                   few changes only have been introduced, based

mainly upon a study of the original specimens.

688 REPORT-- 1895.

     Beside the four p-enera here represented, no other European Dinosaurs at pre-
sent known are sufficiently well preserved to admit of accurate restorations of the
skeleton. This is true, moreover, of the Dinosaurian remains from other parts of
the world outside of North America.

    To present a comprehensive view of the Dinosaurs, so far as now known, I have

prepared the plate exhibited, which gives restorations of the twelve best-known
types, as I have thus far been able to reconstruct them. Of these twelve forms, eight
are from America: Ayichhaurus, a small carnivorous type from the Trias; Bronto-
saurus, Camptoscairus, Laosaurus, and Stegomurus, all herbivorous, and the carni-
vorous Ceratosaurus, from the Jurassic ; with Cktosaurus and Triceratops, her-
bivores from the Cretaceous. These American forms, with the four from Europe
already shown to you, complete the series represented on the chart exhibiU'd.
They form an instructive group of the remarkable reptiles known as Dinosauria.

     The geological positions of Compsognathu^ and of Scelidosaurus are fully deter-
mined, but that of Hi/psilophodan and Iguanodon is not so clear. The latter are
found in the so-called Wealden, but just what the Wealden is I have not been able
to determine from the authorities I have consulted. The Cretaceous age of these
deposits appears to be taken for granted here, but the evidence as it now stands
seems to me to point rather to the upper Jurassic as their true position. If I
should find the vertebrate fossils now known from your Wealden in the Rocky
Mountains, where I have collected many corresponding forms, I should certainly
call them Jurassic, and have good reason for so doing. Moreover, after visiting
typical Wealden localities here and on the Continent, I can still see no reason for
doing otherwise so far as the vertebrate fossils are concerned, and iu such fresh-
water deposits their evidence should be conclusive. I have already called attention
to this question of the age of the Wealden, and do so again, as I believe it worthy
of a careful reconsideration by English geologists.

3. Preliminary Notice of an Exposure of Rhatic Beds, near East Leake,

    Nottinghamshire. By Montagu Browne, F.G.S., F.Z.S. (Fourth

      Contribution to Rhcetic Geology.)

    On the confines of Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, near East Leake it he

latter county, the extension of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway
has lately exposed an interesting section by the tunnel, Avhich cuts through the
White Hills, under the high road, and is bounded on the west by the coppice
called the ' Devil's Garden,' ' which is near the end of a westerly extension or pro-
montory of the Liassic with Rhaetic beds.

     The ordinary appearance of Midland exposures is here exhibited, and many of

the beds are homotaxial, both by lithology and contained fossils, with those of
exposures so remote as Wigston in Leicestershire, Westbury-on-Severn, Pylle Hill

al Uristol, and Watchet in Somersetshire. As in these exposures, there is no

--actual or massive bone- bed as at Aust, &c., although, most curiously, one piece

and one only, identical with the Aust breccia was picked up at the ' tip.' The
usual minerals are present in the shales and stone, viz., .'elenite, iron pyrites,
oxides and peroxides of iron, and galena sparingly. The fossils are interesting, not
only as supplementing those previous!}' alluded to by the writer in former contri-
butions,^ but as exhibiting some rare forms not previou.sly recorded for Britain,

as given in the following list:

      ' This ancient and singular appellation is suggested by the writer as probably due
to the exposure of the black shales here in digging, the surroundings being a wide
area of Keuper red marls.

L Probable Extension of the Seas during Upper Tertiary Times
              in Western Europe. By G. F. Dollfus.

Taking into consideration the position and nature of all the outliers of

Upper Tertiary age, the author is led to the following conclusions as to the exten-
sion of the Neogenic seas in "Western Europe. During Miocene times England

was united to France, and we have pi'oof of the existence of two seas in the western

part of Europe ; one on the east extended over part of Belgium (Bolderian system),

--Holland, and north of Germany probably this sea was not very far off the eastern

coast of England ; the other sea, the Western, or old Atlantic Sea, was off Ireland,

penetrating in various gulfs into France, as in some part of Cotentin, Brittany, in
the Loire valley, in the gulf of the Gironde, but there was no way of communica-

tion with the Mediterranean basin crossing France. Li North Spain there are no

Miocene deposits, in Portugal Miocene beds are jturely littoral.

The communication with the Mediterranean Sea was certainly by the valley

of the Guadalquivir. The Gibraltar Strait had not exactly its present place.
The fauna of these Miocene coasts was warm and very similar to the existing

fauna of Senegal and Guinea.

   We can divide Pliocene time into three periods, but the situations of the seas

were not very different. England was always in direct continental communication

with France, the I'^nglish Channel was not open at all. All the Pliocene deposits of
Belgium, North France, or England, even the Lenham beds, are on the side of the

North-Eastern Sea ; we find all these patches on the northern side of the great
anticlinal line of the Artois, Boulonnais, and Weald. The fauna is different from

--the Miocene, and colder it even turns more and more cold during the progress of

Pliocene lime. On the western or Atlantic side we have little gulfs leading the

sea into the land, but not so frequently and not so far as during Miocene times.

The Cornwall deposits, Cotentin beds, and the Brittany patches are very limited
the basin of the Gironde contains no trace of Pliocene beds, and we have no trace

of recent marine beds at the foot of the Pyrenees. In the north of Spain there is

also no trace of Pliocene beds. The continent seems to have been higher, and the

Atlantic tolerably distant. All the Portuguese sands recently discovered are

littoral, and only on the Algarve coast and south of Spain do we find proof of the
probable communication with the Mediterranean. The Gibraltar Strait was not

always  in  the  same place during  Pliocene  time                          in  the  beginning  probably  the
                                                                         ;

Guadalquivir valley to Murcia continued to be the strait, but later the rock of

Gibraltar was separated from Africa and a new road was open ; this way was cer-
tainly deeper than the former one, and as deep as the existing strait. By this

depression the cold fauna of the depths of the Atlantic penetrated into the Medi-

terranean Sea as far as Sicily and Italy with Ciiprinn Islandica.

a great altitude, and a little lower a good and very long band of Pliocene teds of
marine and continental origin. Quaternary deposits, similarly continental and
littoral, occur lying along the actual coast, pointing out the south side of the

Mediterranean connection.
     In a few words, the English Channel has been opened very recently, and no sea

occupied its place before. No sea has crossed France or central Spain, and we are
obliged to seek for an outlet for the Eastern Sea during Miocene time by way of

Germany, Galicia, and South Russia, or by the north of Scotland.

     During the existence of the Pliocene seas there w.as no other communication
for the Crag seas than the northern one, for the western, the south, and eastern
sides were undoubtedly shut in by land.

                 By Frederick H. Hatch, Ph.D., F.G.S.

The general geological features of these now famous deposits are more or

less familiar to most readers.  The  beds  of  the  ' Main  Keef  Series                               have  been

closely studied from one end of the Ptand to the other, and are now being worked

in an almost continuous series of prosperous gold -mining companies, the whole

distance covered by mines in active operation amounting to forty-six miles. The

beds have the usual characteristics of conglomerates, being composed of pebbles

whicli present every sign of having been water-rolled and worn smooth by attrition.

The pebbles consist of white or smoky quartz, and lie imbedded in a sandy or

quartzitic matrix. The older rocks, from the waste of which these conglomerates

are derived, were probably members of the Primary Formation, on which the Wit-

watersrand beds lie. That these older rocks were largely veined with quartz is

evident from the nature of the pebbles, and that they were not the source of the

gold is evident from the fact that the quartz pebbles do not carry gold, the metallic

contents being confined to the matrix.

There is little doubt that the gold was introduced subsequently to the deposition

of the beds by means of mineralising solutions, which ascended the planes of dis-

ruption and fissuring which resulted from the disturbance of the beds during their

Aupheaval.  considerable amount of basic igneous matter was also introduced,

and now appears in the beds in the form of dykes and intrusive sheets.

The angle of dip of the auriferous beds at their outcrop is generally high

(50°-80°), but the lowest workings of the mines evidence a considerable flattening

of the deposits, the average dip in the lowest levels being at present not more than

30°. It is probable that the flattening will continue, and that the dip in the deep

level workings will be found to be not more than 25°. As these deep levels will

probably be worked to'a vertical depth of 4,000 to 5,000 feet, the zone of workable

auriferous deposit must be at least li mile wide.

12. On the Strata of the Shaft sunk at Stonesjield, Oxon, in 1895.
                       Jhj Edwin A. Walford, F.G.S.

     Since 1860 no continuous section of tlie upper beds of the Inferior Oolite, and
of the limestones intervening between them and the Stonesfield Slate, has been

exposed in Oxfordshire. In 1860 but brief record seems to have been made of the

character of the beds pierced.

     The lower part of the section made by the aid of the British Association in
1894-95 resolves itself readily into three divisions:

        1. Compact buff-coloured limestones.
         2. Sandstone and sandy limestones with vertical markings and borings.
        3. Rubbly coarse-grained oolitic limestone ((/lypeus Grit) zone Ammonites

                    Parkinsoni.

Series 1 extends to the north-west as far as Long Compton, in Warwickshire,

and on the north to Sibford in Oxfordshire. Around Chipping Norton it is best

developed, but its vertical boundaries are hardly determinable. I take it to repre-

sent the Fullonian clays and limestones of the South and South-west of England.

Just as at Port-en-Bessiu and Caen, in Normandy, we see at one place the argil-

laceous and argillaceo-calcareous series, and at the other the calcareous and siliceo-

calcareous series, so also from west to east in England the deposits change from

argillaceous to calcareous, and with a poorer fauna.

Series 2, generally underlying the limestones, may be traced as far as Banbury,

Aand has a wide range over Northamptonshire.       bed of Trigonia ( T. signata) marks

is found around Hook Norton, Chipping Norton, and Long Compton, the lower

part of the sandy series, with Ammonites Parkinsoni and remains of marsh plants.

The higher sandy limestones are recognised by the presence of long annulated

stems of Algae (?), extending also through the Northamptonshire deposits, and

characterising the higher beds there. The blue and white sandy limestone of

--Stonesfield is full of vertical markings of plants markings which are prominent

in every section of the ' Estuariue ' sands of Northamptonshire. The succession

of these to the bed with Trigonia signata may be seen in a quarry at Sharpshill,

between Brailes and Hook Norton, where a well-marked band of siliceous limestone

with Trit/onia signata, Ag., T. Lycetti, Waif, is covered with two feet of shattered
siliceous stone pierced with vertical markings. These are the Oxfordshire repre-
sentatives of the Northamptonshire E^tLlarine Sands.

     So far, tlien, the Stonestield section enables ns to get a better understanding of
the relationships of the Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire Inferior Oolite.

     Though the zones of the Northamptonshire Inferior Oolite appear at present to

Dbe ill-defined, we may hope in Sharpe's Series to recognise the representative of

the well-known Clypeus grit of West Oxfordshire and the Cotteswolds.

     This, the first attempt of the Eastern Counties Coal-horing Association, is in

the base of the Cretaceous beds at the depth of 994 feet, and in proving that these

are at once underlain by a much older rock. The Tertiary and Cretaceous beds

3. On the Impoi'tance of extending the Work of the Geological Survey oj

    Great Britain to the Dee2)-seated Rocks by meaiis of Boring. By F. W.

     Harmer, F.G.S.

     The systematic exploration of the subterranean geology of these islands is equally
important from a scientific and a practical point of view. At present our know-
ledge of the structure of the rocks whicli lorm tlie foundation of our island home
is due either to isolated and occasional borings, such as that of the Ipswich Syndi-
cate in search of coal, or to deep wells sunk by mercantile firms, but the latter do
not reach further than is necessary to obtain a supply of water, and the work is
generally suspended just where it becomes geologically "most interesting. But such
a Survey is important practically, because unsuspected sources of wealth may be
hidden under our very feet.

    It is a mistake to suppose that a discovery such as that of a new coal-field
would enrich only the landowners of the district, because whenever any apprecia-

tion of real property takes place, the State at once claims its share of the increased

value, botli for imperial and local purposes. The averag-e for tlie whole countrj' of
the rates raised by local taxation alone was, for 1891, 3s. 8d. in the £, to which

mnst be added imperial taxes and the tithe. It may be stated roughly, that for
every 100/. of yearly ' unearned increment ' the State is benefited in one way or
another by 25;., or one-fourth of the amount. The discovery of a new coal-field

would cause increased prosperity in the district in which it occurred, and from this
the State, through taxation, would derive great though indirect advantage.

     The growing difficulty of finding employment for the ever-increasing popula-

tion of these islands is a strong reason why this Survey' should be undertaken.

     Part of the cost might be borne by the landowners under whose property any
minerals were discovered. Certain districts should be selected with the consent of
the Local Authorities, and Parliamentary power taken to charge a royalty on any
minerals obtained below a certain depth. Landowners would probably welcome
proposals to make borings on their estates on such conditions. In the first instance,
however, the Survey should map out accurately the subterranean limits of existing
coal-fields, or mineral-bearing rocks, but trial borings sliould be put down in dif-
ferent localities, and each new boring would help to show more plainly the direc-

tion in which farther investigations should be made. Much light would be thrown

by such a Survey on the circulation of underground waters, a matter of great

practical importance.

     The expense of boring would be much reduced if undertaken on a large scale,
as machinery and apparatus would be available again and again. The Survey
would employ its own workmen, who would become increasingly efficient and

economical.

                  4. The Cladoclonts of the Uj^per Devonian of Ohio.

                 By Professor E. W. Claypole, D.Sc. (Lond.)

     Numerous specimens of the Cladodonts of the Cleveland Shale in Ohio have
been found by Dr. William Clark. They for the first time reveal to us the general
form of the fishes to which belonged the teeth that have alone so long represented
the genus Cladodus. The fossils are in very fair preservation, but their state of
pyritisation has obscured many of the details of their structure. So far as regards
their form, however, we now know that they were long, slender fishes, resembling
in their character the sharks of the present day that they possessed well-deve-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

loped and powerful pectoral and caudal, with weak ventral, fins, the dorsals being
tmknown ; that they were for the most part, or altogether, spiueless ; that at least
one species possessed cladadont teeth of more than one pattern ; and that they had
near the hind end of the body a peculiar fiat expansion or membrane of rudely
semicircular form, which gave to the caudal extremity when seen from above the

outline of a sharp-pointed shovel.

     The largest whole specimen yet found shows a fish of about G feet in length,
but detached teeth and other fragments indicate others of double this size, and
supply abundant proof that in late Devonian times, and in the North American
area, the elasmobranch fishes had attained very great proportions and a high

stage of development.
     Hitherto the Cladodonts have been regarded as, in the main, characterising the

Lower Carboniferous rocks, but we now find them abounding in the earlier Devonian

--strata, and, as shown by the contents of their stomachs, preying in some cases at
--least on the smaller placoderms of the same area.

    From the evidence of the new specimens it appears most likely that the

species already defined from single and isolated teeth can no longer be main-

tained.

           5. The Great Devonian Placoderms of Ohio, xvith Specimens.

                 By Professor E. W. Claypole, D.Sc. {Land.)

     The Upper Devonian Shales of Ohio have recently afforded a remarkable series
of fossil fishes rivalling in size and interest those found many years ago in the Old

Red Sandstoui.'s of similar age in Scotland, and described by Agassiz and Hugh

Miller. The earliest of these, DinicMhys, was closely studied, and its structure
was well explained by the late Dr. Newberr3^ It was an immense armour-clad
fish whose head measured from 2 to 3 feet in length. Titnnichtln/x, the second of
the group, though less massive, was of yet larger size. Gorgonichth/s, the third,
was described by the present writer in 1893, and, so far as is yet known, was
the most formidable of all, possessing jaws of enormous size and thickness, above
24 inches long, ending in teeth or points from 6 to 9 inches in length. The last
of the four, Brontichtkys, of which a description was also published by the writer
in the ' American Geologist' for 1894, is equally heavy and of equal size, but
differs from all the rest in possessing verj' massive symphysial portions in the
mandibles with sockets apparently for the reception of teeth, as in Titanichthys.

     Of the two last-named genera only the jaws are yet known with exactness.
Other portions have been found of Gorgoniclithys, but are still embedded in the

matrix. So far as can at present be determined, all the four are closely allied to
Coccosteiis, and belong to the same family.

     The set of casts exhibited in illustration of the fossils have been prepared by
their discoverer. Dr. "William Clark, and faithfully represent the originals, of many
of which only single specimens are yet known. The labour of extricating them
from the pyritous shale has proved very heavy, and much yet remains to be done

in this direction.

6. Notes on the PhyJogeny of the Graptolites. By Prof. H. A. Nicholson,

        M.D., D.Sc, F.G.S., and J. E. Marr, M.A., F.R.S., Sec. G.S.

     The authors note that the number of stipes possessed by graptolites has been
looked upon as a character of prime importance, many genera being based on the
possession of a certain number. Again, the ' angle of divergence ' has been looked
upon as an important factor in the diagnosis of families. They are, however, led to

believe that a character of essential importance in dealing with the classification of
the graptolites, and one which, in all probability, indicates the true line of descent,
is found in the shape and structure of tlie hydrothecse, the point of next import-
ance as indicating genetic relationship being tlie ' angle of divergence.'

     These views are illustrated by reference to forms belonging to the ' genera
Bryoyraptus, Dichograptus, Tetragraptiis, and Didymograptus, which appear in
turn in this sequence.

     Out of nine Tetragrapti (and the authors know of no other forms referred to
this genus which are represented by well-preserved examples), eight are closely
represented by I'orms of Didymograptus, which are closely comparable with them
as regards characters of hydrothecre and amount of ' angle of divergence,' whilst

the ninth is ccmiparable ^v·ith a Didymograjjtus as regards ' angle of divergence

onl}'. Moreover, four of the Tetragrapti are comparable as regards the two
above-named important characters with firms of Dichograpfii.^ and Brj/nyroptus
with eight or more branches, and the authors conlidently predict the discovery of
forms belonging to these or closely allied many-branched ' genera,' agreeing with
the remaining Tetragrapti in what they regard as essential characters.

     They give details showing the points of agreement of each group of the various
series, including a two-branched, a four-branched, and a mariy-branched lorm, and
point out hoM- difficult it is to understand how the extraordinary resemblances
between the various species of Tetragrapius and Didymograptus (to take one
example) have arisen, if, as usually supposed, all the species of the genera have
descended from a common ancestral form for each genus, in the one case four-

branched, and in the other case two-branched. On the other hand, it is compara-

tively easy to explain the more or less simultaneous existence of forms possessing
                                       --'

696 REPORT-- 1895.

tlie same number of stipes, but otherwise only distantly related, if they are
imagined to be the result of the variation of a number of different ancestral types
along similar lines. Thej' allude to similar phenomena which have been shown to
exist amongst other organisms ; thus Mojsisovics has described analogous eases
amongst the Ammonites, and Buckman (under the name of heterogenetic homoeo-
morphy) amongst the brachiopods, though in this instance the cases of ' species
and not of 'genera' are considered.

      Following the above inferences to their legitimate conclusion, the authors point

out how ' genera ' like Uiplograptus and Monogroptns may contain representatives
of more than one ' family ' of graptolites, according to the classification now in
vogue, which would account for the great diversity in the characters of the mono-

gi'aptid hydrothecse.

      In conclusion, the authors offer a few theoretical observations upon a possible
reason for the changes which they have discussed in the paper.

                     7. Zonal Divisions of the Carboniferous System.

      By E. J. Garwood, 3f.A., F.G.S., and J. E. Makr, M.A., F.RS.

     The authors call attention to previous attempts which have been made to
divide the Carboniferous rocks into zones, noting the zonal divisions of the Lower
(Carboniferous rocks of North England, established by De Koninck and Lohest, and
the view expressed by Waagen that fuller work will enable geologists to define a
series of zones in the Carboniferous as in older and newer strata.

     The detailed work of one of the authors (Mr. Garwood) leads them to suppose
that the following zones occur in the Lower ('arboniferous beds of the northern
part of the Pennine Chain and adjoining regions :

                                   Zone of Productus cf. edelburgensis,

                                               ,, P. latissimus.
                                                 ,, P. giganteus.
                                             ,, Chonetes papilionacea.
                                               ,, Spirifera octoplicata.

     Mr. Garwood has traced the zone of Productus latissimus, occupying ttie same
relative position to that of P. (jiganteus, from Settle, in Yorkshire, to the North-
umbrian coast, near Howick Burn.

     The authors believe that brachiopods and goniatites will furnish good results,
if a detailed study of their distribution is made; and they suf^gest that a Committee
be appointed to inquire into the possibility of dividing the Carboniferous rocks into

zones, to call the attention of local observers to the desirability of collecting fossils

with this view, and, if possible, to retain the services of eminent specialists, to

whom these fossils may be submitted.

           Vancouver's Island, &c. By Henry Woodward, F.R.S.

     Through the kindness of Mr. J. F. Whiteaves, F.G.S., Pab-contologist to the
Geological Survey of Canada, I have lately received a series of Crustacea from
Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Island, and as they offer a close affinity
with forms from our Gault and Greensand, they seem deserving of special notice.

TRAKSACTIOAS OF SECTION C.                                         697

     The existence of Cretaceous beds in Canada has long been known, and the
coalfields of Nanaimo and Coiuox, on Vancouver Island, have been correlated with
the Cretaceous series, as well as tbose of Queen Charlotte Island, and that of
Alberta eastward of the Hocky Mountains.

     The fossils were described by F. B. Meek in 1857, by Dr. B. F. Shumard iu
1858, by Professor II. Y. Hind iu 1859, Dr. Hector in 1861, Mr. ^\. C4abb in
1864. These are all descrijitions of characteristic Cretaceous mollusca. Only two
Crustacea are mentioned, namely, a decapod crustacean, provisionally named
Hoploparia Dulmenensis, from the jSiobara- Beaton grou]) of Manitoba, and a long-
tailed decapod from the Pierre-Fox Hills, or Montana formation. These have not

been seen by the present writer.

     The species now recorded comprise

      1. Several e.rmnples of a small burrowing form of decapod-macrouran crusta-

cean, belonging to the Callumansidce. and common in the chalk of Maastricht and

Faxoe, and the Greensaud of Colin Glen. Belfast.

     The Vancouver Island form is named C:tUianassa Whiteavesii.
     2. The second is a form of brachyuran decapod, belonging to the family
Corystida, and is represented by two imperfect carapaces, one of which shows the
frontal portion well preserved, and is evidently closely related to the genera
Eucorystes and Falceocorystes from the Greensand and Gault of England, and
especially with Falceocorystes Broderipi, from the Gault of Folkestone. I propose
to name this after the discoverer as Falceocorystes Harveyi. The specimens were
obtained from the Cretaceous beds of Comox River, Vancouver Island.
     3. This form is the most abundant of the crabs met with, and is nearly allied
to Plagiophthalmus, but its exact position is somewhat doubtful.
     Mr. Harvey writes that he has found this small crab everywhere in the district
of Vancouver's Island, where there are marine Cretaceous beds and fossils. I have
named it (provisionally) Flayiophthalmus (.«') vancouvere7isis.
     4. The fourth specimen is a crab allied to the genus Homola, and is from
Queen Charlotte Island, Skidegate Channel, west of Alliford Bay, and was
obtained by Mr. J. Richardson. It may be compared with the genus Frosopon
(von Meyer), from the Jurassic, with several forms from the Chalk of Faxoe, and
with Iloinolopsis Edwardsii, from the Gault of Folkestone. I have named it (pro-

visionally) Homolopsis (?) Richardsoni, after the discoverer.
     These crabs occur in concretionary nodules in the Cretaceous beds of Vancouver,

and in black coarse nodules on the beach at Queen Charlotte Island, but they
have not been removed far from the parent rock.

     It is interesting to notice the close approximation between these North-West
American Cretaceous forms of Crustacea and those from the same horizon in Europe,
and it seems to indicate that even so late as Cretaceous times the same marine

fauna existed over a far wider area than it at present covers. This is true, also,

of the abundant molluscan fauna occurring in the same series of beds over very
widely separated areas of the North American continent, from Manitoba in the

east to Vancouver in the west, many of the genera (and perhaps the species also)
being found in our own Cretaceous beds.

Section D.--ZOOLOGY (INCLUDING ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY).

President of the SECTioif William A. Hekbman, D.Sc, F.R.S., F.R.S.E.,

         F.L.S., Professor of Natural History in University College, Liverpool.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12.

     The President delivered the following Address:

DThis year, for the first time in the history of the British Association, Section

meets without including in the range of its subject-matter the Science of Botanj-.

--DZoology now remains as the sole occupant of Section that ' Fourth Committee

of Sciences,' as it was at first called, more than sixty years ago, when our subject
was one of that group of biological sciences, the others being Botany, I'hysiology,
and Anatomy. These allied sciences have successively left us. Like a prolific
mother our Section has given rise one after another to the now independent Sections
of Anthropology, Physiology, and Botany- Our subject-matter has been greatly

--restricted in scope, but it is still verj^ wide this year, when Section I devoted to

the more special physiology of the medical physiologist does not meet, perhaps a

little wider than it may be in other years, since we are on this occasion credited

--with the subject 'Animal Physiology ' surely ahcmjs an integral part of Zoology!

It is to be hoped that this section will always retain that general and comparative
physiology which is inseparable from the study of animal form and structure. The
late Waynflete Professor of Physiology at Oxford, in his Newcastle Address to this
 Section, said ' that every appreciable difterence in structure corresponds to a differ-

ence of function,' ' and his successor, the present Waynflete Professor, has shown
us ' how pointless is structure apart from function, and how baseless and unstable

--is function apart from structure'- the 'argument for the simultaneous exami-

 nation of both ' in that science of Zoology which we profess is, to my mind,

 irresistible.

    We include also in our subject-matter, besides the adult structure and tha

embryonic development of animals, their distribution both in space and time, the
 history and structure of extinct forms, speciography and classification, the study of
 the habits of animals and all that mass of lore and philosophy which has gathered
 around inquiries into instinct, breeding, and heredity. I trust that the discussion
 of matters connected with Evolution will always, to a large extent, remain with
 this Section D, which has witnessed iu the past the addresses, papers, discussions,
and triumphs of Darwin, Huxley, and Wallace.

     When the British Association last met in Ipswich, in 1851, Section I), under

 the Presidency of Professor Henslow, still included Zoology, Botany, and Physio-
 logy, and a glance through the volumes of reports for that and neighbouring ye ars

 recalls to us that our subject has undergone great and striking developments in the

 forty-four years that have elapsed. Zoology was still p re-Darwinian (though

--Charles Darwin was then in the thick of his epoch-making work both what he

 calls his 'plain barnacle work' and his * theoretic species work').' Although the

 cell-theory had been launched a decade before, zoologists were not yet greatly

 concerned with those minute structural details which have since built up the
 .science of Histology. The heroes of our science were then chiefly those glorious

 tield naturalists, observers, and systematists who founded and established on a firm
 basis British Marine Zoology. Edward Forbes, Joshua Alder, Albany Hancock
 were then in active work. George Johnston was at his zoopliytes, Bowerbank at

sponges, Busk at polyzoa. Forbes' short brilliant career was nearly run. He

 probably did more than any of his contemporaries to advance marine zoology. In
 the previous year, at the Edinburgh meeting of the Association, he and his friend

McAndrew, had read their classic reports,- ' On the Investigation of British
 Marine Zoology by means of the Dredge,' and ' On South European Marine Inverte-
brata,' wliich mark the high water level reached at that date, and for some time

 afterwards, in the exploration of our coasts and the explanation of the distribution

of our marine animals. At the Belfast meeting, which followed Ipswich, Forbes
exhibited his great map of the distribution of marine life in * Homoiozoic Belts.' In
November, 1854, he was dead, six months after his appointment to the goal of his

ambition, the professorship at Edinburgh, where, had he lived, there can be no
 doubt he would, with his brilliant ability and unifjue personality, have founded a

great school of Marine Zoology.

   --To return to the early fifties, Huxley whose recent loss to science, to philosophy,
--to culture, we, in common with the civilised world, now deplore at that time just

returned from the memorable voyage of the ' Rattlesnake,' was opening out his
newly acquired treasures of comparative anatomy with papers on Siphonophora

--and on Sagitta, and one on the structure of Ascidians,in which he urged fourteen
--years before Kowalevsky established it on embryological evidence in 1866 that

their relations were with Ampliioxus, as we now believe, rather than with the
Polyzoa or the Lamellibranchiata, as had formerly been supposed. Bates was then
on the -Vmazons, Wallace was just going out to the Malay Archipelago, Wyville

Thomson, Hincks, and Carpenter, the successors of Forbes, Johnston, and Alder,
were beginning their life-work. Abroad that great teacher and investigator,
Johannes Miiller, was training amongst his pupils the most eminent zoologists,
anatomists, and physiologists of the succeeding quarter century. In this country,

as we have seen, Huxley was just beginning to publish that splendid series of
reseirches into the structure of nearly all groups in the animal kingdom, to which

comparative anatomy owes so much.

      In fact, the few years before and after the last Ipswich meeting witnessed the

--activity of some of the greatest of our British zoologists the time was pregnant

with work which has since advanced, and in some respects revolutionised our
subject. It was then still usual for the naturalist to have a competent knowledge
of the whole range of the natural sciences. Edward Forbes, for example, was a

botanist and a geologist, as well as a zoologist. He occupied the chair of Botany

at King's College, London, and the presidential chair of the Geological Section of
the British Association at Liverpool in 1854:. That excessive specialisation, from
which most of us suffer in the present day, had not yet arisen ; and i7i the compre-
hensive, but perhaps not very detailed, survey of his subject taken by one of the

field naturalists of that time, we find the beginnings of different lines of work,

which have since developed into some half-dozen distinct departments of zoology,

are now often studied independently, and are in some real danger of losing touch

with one another (see diagram).
     The splendid anatomical and ·' morphological ' researches of Huxley and

Johannes Miiller have been continued by the more minute histological or cellular
work rendered possible by improvements of the microtome and the microscope,

until at last in these latter years we investigate not merely the cellular anatomy

--of the hody, but the anatomy of the cell if indeed we are permitted to talk of

* cell ' at all, and are not rather constrained to express our results in terms of
' cytomicrosomes,' ' somacules,' or ' idiosomes/ and to regard our morphological
unit, the cell, as a symbiotic community containing two colonies of totally dis-

similar organisms.' To such cytologieal investigations may well be applied Lord

AMacaulay's aphorism, ' point which yesterday was invisible is its goal to-day,

and will be its starting point to-morrow.'
     Somewhat similar advances in methods have led us from the life-histories

studied of old to the new and fascinating science of embryology. The elder Milne-
Edwards and Van Beneden knew that in their life-histories Aseldians produced

tadpole-like young. Kowalevsky (1866) showed that in their embryonic stages
these Ascidian tadpoles have the beginnings of their chief systems of organs
formed in essentially the same manner and from the same embryonic layers as in

the case of the frog's tadpole or any other typical young vertebrate ; and now we

are not content with less than tracing what is called the ' cell-lineage ' of such
Ascidian embryos, so as to show the aucestry and descendants, the traditions

--peculiarities of, and influences at work upon each of the embryonic cells or areas
--of protoplasm throughout many complicated stages. And there is now opening

may be confideutly expected to tell us much in the future in regard to the compe-

tition between species, and the useful or indifferent nature of specific characters.

     Other distinct lines of zoological investigation, upon which I shall not dwell,

comes into contact with, and may be of some service to his fellow-workers in geology.

--And there still remains the central avenue of the wide zoological domain that of

fiers and monographers from Linnaeus to Haeckel, and has culminated in our times in

the magnificent series of fifty quarto volumes, setting forth the scientific results of

the ' Challenger ' Expedition ; a voyage of discovery comparable only in its important
and wide-reaching results with the voyages of Columbus, Gama, and Magellan at

the end of the fifteenth century. It is now so long since the ' Challenger ' investi-

gations commenced that few I suppose outside the range of professional zoologists

are aware that, although the expedition took place in 1872 to 1876, the work

--resulting therefrom has been going on actively imtil now for nearly a quarter of
--a century in all and in a sense, and a very real one, will never cease, for the

* Challenger ' has left an indelible mark upon science, and will remain through the

ages exercising its powerful, guiding influence, like the work of Aristotle, Newton,

and Darwin.

Most of the authors of the special memoirs on the sea and its various kinds of

inhabitants, have interpreted in a liberal spirit the instructions they received to

examine and describe tlae collections entrusted to them, and have given us very

valuable summaries of the condition of our knowledge of the animals in question,

while some of the reports are little less than complete monographs of the groups.

myI desire to pay a tribute of respect to  former teacher and scientific chief. Sir

Wyville Thomson, to whose initiative, along with Dr. W. B. Carpenter, we owe

the first inception of our now celebrated deep-sea dredging expeditions, and to

whose scientific enthusiasm, combined with administrative skill, is due in great part

the successful accomplishment of the ' Lightning,' the ' Porcupine,' and the
* Challenger ' Expeditions. Wyville Thomson lived long enough to superintend

the first examination of the collections brought home, their division into groups,

Heand the allotment of these to specialists for description.  enlisted the services

of his many scientific friends at home and abroad, he arranged the general plan of

the work, decided upon the form of publication, and died in 1882 after seeing the

first ten or twelve zoological reports through the press.

Within the last few months have been issued the two concluding volumes of

this noble series, dealing with a summary of the results, conceived and written in

a masterly manner by the eminent editor of the reports. Dr. John Murraj\ An

event of such first-rate importance in zoology as the completion of this great work

myought not to pass unnoticed at this zoological gathering. I desire to express

appreciation and admiration of Dr. Murray's work, and I do not doubt that the

Section will permit me to convey to Dr. Murray the congratulations of the

zoologists present, and their thanks for his splendid services to science. Murray, in

these ' Summary ' volumes, has given definiteness of scope and purpose, and a

-- --tremendous impulse, to that branch of science mainly zoological which is coming

to be called

              OCE-UfOGRAPHr.

     Oceanography is the meeting ground of most of the sciences. It deals with
botany and zoology, ' including animal physiology ; chemistry, physics, mechanics,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          '

meteorology, and geology all contribute, and the subject is of course intimately

connected with geography, and has an incalculable influence upon mankind, his
distribution, characteristics, commerce, and economics. Thus oceanography, one of
the latest developments of marine zoology, extends into the domain of, and ouwht
to find a place in, every one of the sections of the British Association.

     Along with the intense specialisation of certain lines of zoology in the last
quarter of the nineteenth century, it is important to notice that there are also lines

of investigation wliicli require an extended knowledge of, or at least make use of the
results obtained from, various distinct subjects. One of tbese is oceauograpby,

another is bionomics, which I have referred to above, a third is the philosophy of
zoology, or all those studies which bear upon the theory of evolution, and a fourth

--is the investigation of practical fishery problems--which is chiefly an application

of marine zoology. Of these four subjects which while analytic enough in the
detailed investigation of any particular problem, are synthetic in drawing together
and making use of the various divergent branches of zoology and the neighbouring

--sciences oceanography, bionomics, and the fisheries' investigation, are most closely

related, and I desire to devote the remainder of this Address to the consideration

of some points in connection with their present position.
     Dr. Murray, in a few only too brief paragraphs at the end of his detailed sum-

mary of the results of the ' Challenger ' Expedition, which I have alluded to above,
states some of the views, highly suggestive and original, at which he has himself
ai'rived from his unique experience. Some of his conclusions are very valuable
contributions to knowledge, which will no doubt be adopted by marine zoologists.

Others, I venture to think, are less sound and well founded, and will scarcely stand
the test of time and further experience. But for all such statements, or even sug-

gestions, we should be thankful. They do much to stimulate further research

they serve, if they can neither be refuted nor established, as working hypotheses

and even if they have to be eventually abandoned, we should bear in mind what

Darwin has said as to the difference in their influence on science between erroneous

facts and erroneous theories. 'False facts are highly injurious to the progress of

science, for they often endure long ; but false views, if supported by some evidence,

do  little  harm, for  everyone  takes  a  salutary  pleasure                                             in  proving their falseness                                                                                                   and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

when this is done, one path towards error is closed, and the road to truth is often

at the same time opened.'

    With all respect for Murray's work, and fully conscious of my own temerity in

venturing to differ from one who has had such an extended experience of the sea

and its problems, I am constrained to express my disagreement with some of his

conclusions. And I am encouraged to do so by the belief that Murray will rightly

feel that the best compliment which zoologists can pay to his work is to give it

Hecareful, detailed consideration, and discuss it critically.                                                 will, I am sure, join

me in the hope that, whether his views or mine prove the false ones, we may be

able, by their discussion, to close a ' path towards error,' and possibly open ' the

road to truth.'

     One of the points upon which Murray lays considerable stress, and to the

elaboration of which he devotes a prominent position in his ' General Observations
on the Distribution of Marine Organisms,' is the presence of what he has called a
' mud-line ' around coasts at a depth of about one hundred fathoms. It is the
point ' at which minute particles of organic and detrital matters in the form of

mud begin to settle on the bottom of the ocean.' He regards it as the great

feeding ground, and a place where the fauna is most abundant, and from which
there have hived off, so to speak, the successive swarms or migrations which have

--peopled other regions the deep waters, the open sea, the shallow waters and the

estuaries, fresh waters, and land. Murraj' thus gives to his mud-line both a
present and an historic importance which can scarcely be surpassed in the economy

of life on this globe. I take it that the historic and the presenfimportauce stand

--or fall together that the evidence as to the origin of faunas in the past is derived

from their distribution at the present day, and lam inclined to think that Murray's

opinion as to the distribution of animals in regard to the mud-line is not entirely

-- Ain accord with the experience of specialists, and is not based upon reliable statistics.

Murray's own statement is - : ' depth is reached along the Continental shores

facing the great oceans immediately below which the conditions become nearly
uniform in all parts of the world, and where the fauna likewise presents a great
uniformity. This depth is usually not far above nor far below the 100 -fathom

   line, and is marliPil out by wliat I have elsewhere designated as the Mud-line. , . .'

   ' Here is situated the great feeding ground in the ocean . . . ' and he then goes on
   (page 1434) to enumerate the Crustaceans, such as species of Calamis, Euchceta,

   Fasiphcea, Cranf/on, Calocaris, Pandcdus, Hippolyte, many amphipods, isopods,

   and immense nuuibers of schizopods, which swarm, with fishes and cephalopods,

   immediately over this mud deposit. Now I venture to think that the experience of

   some of those who have studied the marine zoology of our own coasts does not bear out

   this statement. In the first place, our experience in the Irish Sea is that mud may

   be found at almost any depth, but is very varied in its nature and in its source.

   AThere may even be mud laid down between tide marks in an estuary where a very
   considerable current runs.  deposit of mud may be due to the presence of an eddy

   or a sheltered corner in which the finer particles suspended in the water are able to

   sink, or it may be due to the wearing away of a limestone beach, or to quantities

   of alluvium brought down by a stream from the land, or to the presence of a sub-

   merged bed of boulder clay, or even, in some places, to the sewage and refuse from

   coast towns. Finally, there is the deep water mud, a very stiff blue-grey substance

   which sets, when dried, into a firm clay, and this is, I take it, the mud of which

   Dr. Murray writes. But in none of these cases, and certainly not in the last men-
   mytioned, is there in
                           experience or in that of several other naturalists I have

   consulted, any rich fauna associated with the mud. In fact, I would regard mud

   as supporting a comparatively poor fauna as compared with other shallow water

   deposits.

   For practical purposes, round our own British coasts, it is still convenient to

   make use of the zones of depth marked out by Forbes. The first of these is the

   ' Littoral zone,' the space between tide marks, characterised by the abundance of sea-

   weeds, belonging to the genera Lichina, Fucus, Enteromorpha, Polysiphonia, and

   others, and by large numbers of individuals belonging to common species of

   Balanus, Mytiiuis, Littorinn, Turpura, and Patella amongst animals. The second

   zone is the ' Laniinarian,' which extends from low water mark to a depth of a few

   fathoms, characterised by the abundant growth of large sea-weeds belonging to

   the genera Laminarirr, Alaria, and Himanthalia, and by the presence of^'the

   beautiful red seu- weeds (Floridere). Tliere is abundance of vegetable food, and

   animals of all groups swarm in this zone, the numbers both of species and of

   individuals being very great. The genera Helcion, Trochus, and Lacuna are

   characteristic molluscan forms in our seas. Next comes Forbes' ' Coralline' zone

   badly so named, extending from about ten to forty or fifty fathoms or so. Here

   we are beyond the range of the ordinary sea- weeds, but the calcareous, coral-like

   NulUpores are present in places in such abundance as to make up deposits coverino-

   the floor of the sea for miles. Hydroid zoophytes and polyzoa are also abundauf,
   and it is in this zone that we find the shell-beds lying off our coasts, produced by

   great accumulations of species of Perf??;, Ostrea, Pectunculus, FususAud Buccinum

   and forming rich feediug grounds for many of our larger fishes. All groups of

   marine animals are well represented in this zone, and Antedon, Opliiothrix, Ophio-

   f/lypha, Fdalia, In nckus, and Eurynome, maybe mentioned as characteristic' o-enera.
   Lastly, there is what may be appropriately called the zone of deep mud (although

   Forbes did not call it so), extending from some fifty fathoms down to (in our seas)

   We' one hundred or so. The upper limit of this zone is Murray's mud-line.  come

   upon it in the deep fjord-like sea-lochs on the west of Scotland, and in the Irish

   ties have been described from it of late years, but we have no reason to^believe

   that the number of these is great compared with the number of animals obtained

   from shallower waters.

   Dr. Murray not only insists upon the abundance of arimals on the mud, and its

I

 importaBce as the great feeding ground and place of origin of life in the ocean,
 but he also (p. 1432) draws conclusions as to the relative numbers of animals taken
 by a single haul of the trawl in deep and shallow waters which can scarcely be
 received, 1 think, by marine zoologists without a protest. His statement runs
 (p. 143l*) : ' It is interesting to compare single hauls made in the deep sea and in
 shallow water with respect to the number of difierent species obtained. For in-

 stance, at station 146 in the Southern Ocean, at a depth of 1,375 fathoms the 200
 specimens captured belonged to 59 genera and 78 species.' That was with a 10-foot
 trawl dragged for at most two miles during at most two hours. Murray then goes
 on to say : ' In depths less than 50 fathoms, on the other hand, I cannot find in

all my experiments any record of such a variety of organisms in any single haul

even when using much larger trawls and dragging over much greater distances.'

 He quotes the statistics of the Scottish Fishery Board's trawliugs in the North

 Sea, with a 25 ft. trawl, to show that the average catch is 7'3 species of inverte-

 brata and 83 species of fish, tlie greatest number of both together recorded in one
baul being 29 species. Murray's own trawlings in the West of Scotland gave a
 much greater number of species, sometimes as many as 50, ' still not such a great
 variety of animals as was procured in many instances by the " Challenger's" small

 trawl in great depths.'

     Now, in the first place, it is cin-ious that Murray's own table on p. 1437, in

 which he shows that the ' terrigenous' deposits lying along the shore-lines yield

 many more animals, both specimens and species, per haul, than do the ' pelagic '

 deposits' at greater depths, such as red clays and globigerina oozes, seems directly

opposed to the conclusion quoted above. In the second place, I am afraid that Dr.
 Murray has misunderstood the statistics of tiie Scottish Fishery Board when he
quotes them as showing that only 73 or so species of invertebrates are brought
 up, on the average, in the trawl net. I happen to know from Mr. Thomas Scott,
 F.L.S., the naturalist who has compiled the statistics in question, and also from
my own observations when on board the ' Garland ' on one of her ordinary trawling
expeditions, that the invertebrata noted down on the station sheet are merely a
few of the more conspicuous or in other ways noteworthy animals. No attempt is

--made-- nor could possibly be made in the time by the one naturalist who has to

attend to tow-nets, water bottle, the kinds, condition, food, &c., of the fish caught

--and other matters to give anything like a complete or even approximate list of

the species, still less the number of individual.", brought up in the trawl. I submit,
therefore, that it is entirely misleading to compare those Scottish Fishery Board

statistics, which were not meant for such a purpose but only to give a rough idea

of the fauna associated with the fish upon certain grounds, with the carefully

elaborated results, worked out at leisure by many specialists in their laboratories,
of a haul of the ' Challenger's ' trawl. Of Dr. Murray's own trawlings in the West

of Scotland I cannot, of course, speak so positively, but I shall be surprised to
learn that the results of each haul were as carefully preserved and as fully worked

out by specialists as were the ' ('hallenger ' collections.
      Lastly, on the next L.M.B.C.- dredging expedition in the Irish Sea after the

appearance of Dr. Murray's volumes, I set. myself to determine the species taken
in a haul of the trawl for comparison with the ' Challenger ' numbers. The haul was
taken on June 23, at 7 miles west from Peel, on the north bank, bottom sand and

shells, depth 21 fathoms, with a trawl of only 4 ft. beam, less than half the size

' One of the earliest of the ' Challenger ' oceanographic results, the classification

of the submarine deposits into 'terrigenous' and 'pelagic,' seems inadequate to

represent fully the facts in regard to sea-bottoms, so I am proposing elsewhere (^Report

of IrisJt Sea Commiitee) the following amended classification :--(!) Terrigenous
(Murray), where the deposit is formed chiefly of mineral particles derived from the

waste of the land                                                                                  (2)  Neritic, where  the deposit is chiefly of organic origin, and is
                                                                                                ;

derived from the shells and other hard parts of the animals and plants living on

the bottom; (3) Planktonic (Murray's 'pelagic'), where the greater part of the
deposit is formed of the remains of free-swimming animals and plants which lived

in the sea over the deposit.

   of the ' Challenger ' one, and it was not down for more than twenty minutes I noted
   down the species observed, and I tilled two bottles with vindetermined stuff' which

   my assistant, Mr. Andrew Scott, and I examined the following day in the labora-

   tory. Our list comes to at least 112 species, belonging to at least 103 genera.* I

   counted 120 duplicate specimens which, added to 112, gives 232 individuals, but

   there may well have been 100 more. This experience, then, is very different from

   --Murray's, and gives far larger numbers in every respect specimens, species, and
   --genera than even the ' Challenger ' deep-water haul quoted. I append my list of

   species,'- and practised marine zoologists will, I think, see at a glance that it is

   nothinij- out of the way, that it is a fairly ordinary assemblage of not uncommon
   animals such as is frequently met with when dredging in the ' coralline ' zone. I
   am sure that I have taken better netfuls than this both in the Irish Sea and on the
   West of Scotland.

       In order to get another case on different ground, not of my own choosing, on

   the first occasion after the publication of Dr Murray's volumes when I was out

   witnessing the trawling observations of the Lancashire Sea Fisheries steamer ' John

   Fell,' I counted, with the help of my assistant, Mr. Andrew Scott, and the men on

   board, the restilts of the first haul of the shrimp trawl. It was taken at the
   mouth of the Mersey estuary, inside the Liverpool bar, on what the naturalist would
   consider very unfavourable ground, with a bottom of muddy sand, at a depth of
   6 fathoms. The shrimp trawl (1 i in. mesh) was down for one hour, and it brought

   up over seventeen thousand specimens referable to at least 39 species,^ belonging to

   34 genera. These numbers have been exceeded on many other hauls taken in the

   --ordinary course of work by the Fisheries steamer in Liverpool Bay for example,

   on this occasion the fish numbered 5,943, and I have records of hauls on which
   the fish numbered over 20,000, and tbe total catch of individual animals must

   have been nearly 50,000. Can any of Dr. Murray's hauls on the deep mud beat

   these figures ?

        The conclusion, then, at which I arrive in regard to the distribution of animals

   in deep water and in water shallower than 50 fathoms, from my own experience

   and an examination of the ' Challenger ' results, is in some respects the reverse of
   Murray's. I consider that there are more species and more individuals in the

   shallower waters, that the deep mud as dredged has a poor fauna, that the
   ' Coralline ' zone has a much richer one, and that the ' Laminarian zone, where

   there is vegetable as well as animal food, has probably the richest of all.
        In order to come to as correct a conclusion as possible on the matter I have

   consulted several other naturalists in regard to the smaller groups of more or less
   free-swimming Crustacea, such as Copepoda and Ostracoda, which I thought might

   --possibly be in considerable numbers over the mud. I have asked three well-known

   specialists on such Crustaceans viz.. Professor G. S. Brady, F.R.S., Mr. Thomas

        ' It is interesting, in connection with Darwin's opinion that an animal's most
   formidable competitors in the struggle for existence are those of its own kind or
   closely allied forms, to notice the Isrge proportion of genera to species in such liauls.

   I have noticed this in many lists, and it certainly suggests that closely related forms

   are comparatively rarely taken together.

--Scott, F.L.S., and Mr. I. C. Thompson, F.L.S. and tliey all agree in stating that,

 although interesting and peculiar, the Copepoda and Ostracoda from the deep mud

 are not abundant either in species or in individuals. In answer to the question
 which of the three regions (1) the littoral zone, (2) from low water to 20 fathoms,
 and (3) from 20 fathoms onwards, is richest in small free-swimming, but bottom-
 haunting, Crustacea, they all replied the middle region from to 20 fathoms, which
is the Laminarian zone and the upper edge of the Coralline. Professor Brady

assures me that nearly every other kind of bottom and locality is better than mud

for obtaining Ostracoda. Mr. T. Scott considers that Ostracoda are most abundant

in shallow water, from 5 to 20 fathoms. He tells me that as the result of his

experience in Loch Fyne, where a great part of the loch is deep, the richest fauna
is always where banks occur, coming up to about 20 I'athoms, and having the
bottom formed of sand, gravel, and shells. The fauna on and over such banks,

which are in the Coralline zone, is much richer than on the deeper mud around
them. On an ordinary shelving shore on the west coast of Scotland Mr. Scott,
who has had great experience in collecting, considers that the richest fauna is

usually at about 20 fathoms. My own experience in dredging in Norway is the

same. In the centre of the fjords in deep water on the mud there are rare forms,

but very few of thenj, while in shallower water at the sides, above the mud, on
gravel, shells, rock, and other bottoms, there is a very abundant fauna.

     Probably no gi'oup of animals in the sea is of so much importance from the
point of view of food as the Copepoda. They form a great part of the food of
whales, and of herrings and many other useful fish, both in the adult and in the

larval state, as well as of innumerable other animals, large and small. Con-
sequently, I have inquired somewhat cai'efuUy into their distribution in the sea,
with the assistance of Professor Brady, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Thompson. These
experienced collectors all agree that Copepoda are most abundant, both as to species
and individuals, close round the shore, amongst seaweeds, or in shallow water in
the Laminarian zone over a weedy bottom. Individuals are sometimes extremely
abundant on the surface of the sea amongst the plankton, or in shore pools

near high water, where, amongst Enteromorpha, the Ilarpacticidoe swarm in im-
mense profusion ; but, for a gathering rich in individuals, species, and genera, the

experienced collector goes to the shallow waters of the Laminarian zone. In

regard to the remaining, higher, groups of the Crustacea my friend, Mr. Alfred
O. Walker, tells me that he considers them most abundant at depths of to 20

fathoms.

      I hope no one will think that these are detailed matters interesting only to
the collector, and having no particular bearing upon the great problems of biology.

The sea is admittedly the starting-point of life on this earth, and the conclusions
we come to as to tlie distribution of life in the different zones must form and

--modify our views as to the origin of the faunas as to the peopling of the deep

sea, tile shallow waters, and the land. Murray supposes that life started in
Pre-Cambrian times on the mud, and from there spread upwards into shallower
waters, outwards on to the surface, and, a good deal later, downwards to the
abysses by means of the cold Polar waters. The late Professor Moseley considered
the pelagic or surface life of the ocean to be the primitive life from which all

the others have been derived. Professor W. K. Brooks ' considers that there was

a primitive pelagic fauna, consisting of the simplest microscopic plants and
animals, and ' that pelagic life was abundant for a long period during which the
bottom was uninhabited.'

      I, on the other hand, for the reasons given fully above, consider that the

Laminarian zone close to low-water mark is at present the richest in life, that it
probably has been so in the past, and that if one has to express a more definite
opinion as to where, in Pre-Cambrian times, life in its simplest forms first appeared,
I see no reason why any other zone should be considered as having a better claim
than what is now the Laminarian to this distinction. It is there, at present at
any rate, in tlie upper edge of the Laminarian zone, at the point of junction of sea,

land, and air, where there is a profusion of food, where the materials brought down
by streams or worn away from the land are first deposited, where the animals are
able to receive the greatest amount of light and heat, oxygen and food, without

being exposed periodically to the air, rain, frost, sun, and other adverse conditions

-- --of the littoral zone, it is there that life -it seems to me ismost abundant, growth

most active, competition most severe. It is there, probably, that the surrounding
conditions are most favourable to animal life ; and, therefore, it seems likely that
it is from this region that, as the result of overcrowding, migrations have taken
place downwards to the abysses, outwards on the surface, and upwards on to the
shore. Finally, it is in this Laminarian zone, probably, that under the stress of

competition between individuals and between allied species evolution of new forms
by means of natural selection has been most active. Here, at any rate, we find,

along with some of the most primitive of animals, some of the most remarkably
modified forms, and some of the most curious cases of minute adaptation to

environment. This brings us to the subject of

                                    BioNoinos,

which deals with the habits and variations of animals, their modifications, and the

relations of these modifications to the surrounding conditions of existence.

It is remarkable that the great impetus given by Darwin's work to biological

investigation has been chiefly directed to problems of structure and development,

and not so much to bionomics until lately. "Variation amongst animals in a state

of nature is, however, at last beginning to receive the attention it deserves. Bateson

has collected together, and classified in a most useful book of reference, the

numerous scattered observations on variation made by many investigators, and has

drawn from some of these cases a conclusion in regard to the discontinuity of

variation whicli many field zoologists find it hard to accept.

Weldon and Karl Pearson have recently applied the methods of statistics and

mathematics to the study of individual variation. This method of investigation,

in Professor Weldon's hands, may be expected to yield results of great interest in

regard to the influence of variations in the young animal upon the chance of sur-

vival, and so upon the adult characteristics of the species. But while acknow-

ledging the value of these methods, and admiring the skill and care with which

they have been devised and applied, I must emphatically protest against the idea

which has been suggested, that only by such mathematical and statistical methods

of study can we successfully determine the influence of the environment on species,

gauge the utility of specific characters, and throw further light upon the origin of

myspecies. For  part, I believe we shall gain a truer insight into those mysteries

which still involve variations and species by a study of the characteristic features

of individuals, varieties, and species in a living state in relation to their environ-

ment and habits. The mode of work of the old field naturalists, supplemented by

the apparatus and methods of the modern laboratory, is, I believe, not only one of

the most fascinating, hut also one of the most profitable, fields of investigation for

the philosophical zoologist. Such studies must be made in that modern outcome

of the growing needs of our science, the Zoological Station, where marine animals

can be kept in captivity under natural conditions, so that their habits may be

--closely observed, and where we can follow out the old precept first, Observation

and Reflection ; then E.xperiment.

The biological stations of the present day represent, then, a happy union of

the field work of the older naturalists with the laboratory work of the comparative

anatomist, histologist, and embryologist. They are the culmination of the

* Aquarium ' studies of Kingsley and Gosse, and of the feeling in both scientific

men and amateurs, which was expressed by Herbert Spencer when he said : ' Who-

ever at the seaside has not had a microscope and an aquarium has yet to learn what

the highest pleasures of the seaside are.' Moreover, I feel that the biological

station has come to the rescue, at a critical moment, of our laboratory worker

who, without its healthy, refreshing influence, is often in these latter days in peril

of losing his intellectual life in the weary maze of microtome methods and tran-

scendental cytology. The old Greek myth of the Libyan giant, Antreus, who

wrestled with Hercules and regained his strength each time he touched his mother

earth, is true at least of the zoologist. I am sure he derives fresh vigour from

every direct contact with living nature.

    In our tanks and artificial pools we can reproduce the Littoral and the Lami-

--narian zones ; we can see the methods of feeding and breeding the two most
Wepowerful factors in influencing an animal.
                                                                                                                                                                        can study mimicry, and test

theories of protective aud warning colouration.

The explanations given by these theories of the varied forms and colours of

animals were first applied by such leaders in our science as Bates, Wallace, and

Darwin, chiefly to insects and birds, but have lately been extended, by the investi-

gations of Giard, Garstaug, Clubb, and others, to the case of marine animals. I

may mention very briefly one or two examples. Amongst the Nudibranchiate

-- --Mollusca familiar animals around most parts of our British coasts we meet

with various forms which are edible, and, so far as we know, unprotected by any

defensive or oflenslve apparatus. Such forms are usually shaped or coloured so as

to resemble more or less their surroundings, and so become inconspicuous in their

natural haunts. Dendronotus arborescens, one of the largest and most handsome

of our British Nudibranchs, is such a case. The large, branched processes on its

back, and its rich purple-brown and yellow markings, tone in no well with the

masses of brown and yellow zoophytes and purplish-red seaweeds, amongst which

we usually find Dendronotus, that it becomes very completely protected from
observation ; and, aa I know from my own experience, the practised eye of the

naturalist may fail to detect it lying before him in the tangled forests of a shore-

pool.

      Other Nudibranchs, however, belonging to the genus Hulis, for example, are

coloured in such a brilliant and seemingly crude manner, that they do not tone in
with any natural surroundings, and so are always conspicuous. They are active in

their habits, and seem rather to court observation than to shun it. When we

remember that such species of Uolis are protected by the numerous stinging cells
in the cnidophorous sacs placed on the tips of all the dorsal processes, and that
they do not seem to be eaten by other animals, we have at once an explanation of
their fearless habits and of their conspicuous appearance. The brilliant colours are

in this case of a warning nature for the purpose of rendering the animal provided
with the stinging cells noticeable and recognisable. But it must be remembered

that in a museum jar, or in a laboratory dish, or as an illustration in a book or on

the wall, Dendronotus is quite as conspicuous and striking an animal as Eolis. In

o'-der to interpret correctly the effect of their forms and colours, we must see them
alive and at home, and we must experiment upon their edibility or otherwise in the

tanks of our biological stations.^

    Let me give you one more example of a somewhat different kind. The soft,

unprotected mollusc, Lmnellaria perspicua, is not uncommonly found associated (as
Giard first pointed out) with colonies of the compound Ascidian Leptodinum
maculatum, and in these cases the Lamellaria is found to be eating the Leptodinum,
and lies in a slight cavity which it has excavated in the Ascidian colony, so as to
be about flush with the general surface. The integument of the mollusc is,
both in general tint and also in surface markings, very like the Ascidian
colony with its scattered ascidiozooids. This is clearly a good case of pro-
tective colouring. Presumably the Lamellaria escapes the observation of its
enemies through being mistaken for a part of the Leptodinum colony ; and the
Leptodinum, being crowded like a sponge with minute sharp-pointed spicules, is, I
suppose, avoided as inedible by carnivorous animals, which might devour such
things as the soft unpi-otected mollusc. But the presence of the spicules evidently
does not protect the Leptodiimm from Lamellaria, so that we have, if the above
interpretation is correct, the curious result that the Lamellaria profits by a protec-
tive characteristic of the Le]}todi/iu7n, for which it has itself no respect, or, to put

    ' See my experiments on lishes with Nudibranchs in Trans. BioL Sue, Jjixevpool,

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  709

it another way, the Lept.oclinum is protected against enemies to some extent for Ihe
benefit of the Lamellarin which preys upon its vitals.

    It is, to my mind, no sufficient objection to theories of protective and warning
colouration that careful investigation may from time to time reveal cases where a

disguise is penetrated, a protection frustrated, an ofi'ensive device supposed to
confer inedibility apparently ignored. AVe must bear in mind that the enemies,
as well as their prey, are exposed to competition, are subject to natural selection,
are undergoing evolution ; that the pursuers and the pursued, the eaters and the

eaten, have been evolved together ; and that it may be of great advantage to be

protected from same, even if not from all enemies. Just as on land some animals

can browse upon thistles whose ' nemo me impune lacessit ' spines are supposed to

confer immunity from attack, so it is quite in accord with our ideas of evolution
by means of natural selection to suppose that some marine animals have evolved
an indifference to the noxious sponge or to the bristling Ascidian, which are able
by their defensive characteristics, like the thistle, to repel the majority of

uivaders.

    Although we can keep and study the Littoral and Laminarian animals at ease
in our zoological stations, it may perhaps be questioned how far we can reproduce

in our experimental and observational tanks the conditions of the ' Coralline ' and

--the ' Deep-mud ' zones. One might suppose that the pressure which we have no
--means as yet for snpplyirg' and which at 30 fathoms amounts to nearly 100 lbs.

on the square inch, and at 80 fathoms to about 240 lb., or over 2 cwt. on the
square inch, would be an essential factor in the life conditions of the inhabitants

of such depths, and yet we have kept half a dozen specimens of Calocaris

tnacandrea, dredged from 70 to 80 fathoms, alive at the Port Erin Biological

Station for several weeks ; we have had both the red and the yellow forms of

Sarcodictyo7i cateiuita, dredged from 30 to 40 fathoms, in a healthy condition with
the polypes freely expanded for an indefinite period; and Mr. Arnold "Watson

has kept the Polynoid worm, Panthaiis oerstedi, from the deep mud at over

50 fathoms, alive, healthy, and building its tube under observation, first for a

week at the Port Erin Station, and then for many months at Sheffield in a

comparatively small tank with no depth of water. Consequently it seems clear
that, with ordinary care, almost any marine animals from such depths as are

found within the British area may be Icept under observation and submitted to
experiment in healthy and fairly natural conditions. The Biological Station, with

its tanks, is in fact an arrangement whereby w^e bring a portion of the sea with its
rocks and bottom deposits and seaweeds, with ifs inhabitants and their associates,
their food and their enemies, and place it for continuous study on our laboratory

table. It enables us to carry on the bionomical investigations to which we look

for information as to the methods and progress of evolution; in it lie centred our

connection with our coast fisheries. This brings me to the last subject which I

shall touch upon, a subject closely related both to Oceanography and Bionomics,
and one which depends much for its future advance upon our Biological Stations--

that is the subject of

or industrial Ichthyology, the scientific treatment of fishery investigations, a
subject to which Professor M'Intosh has first in this country directed the

attention of zoologists, and in which he has been guiding us for the last decade by

his admirable researches. What chemistry is to the aniline, the alkali, and some

other manufactures, marine zoology is to our fishing industries.

     ' Following up M. Regnard's experiments, some mechanical arrangement
whereby water could be kept circulating and aerated under pressure in closed tanks
might be devised, and ouglit to be tried at some zoological station. I learn from
the Director at the Plymouth Station that some of the animals from deep water,
such as Polyzoa, do not expand in their tanks.
710 REPORT-- 1895.

     Alt.boug-h zoology has never appealed to popular estimation as a directly useful

           ^

science having industrial applications in the same way that Chemistry and Physics

have done, and consequently has never had its claims as a subject of technical

education  sufficiently recognised                                                                                                       westill, as  in  this  Section  are well aware, our
                                                                                                                                      ;

subject has many technical applications to the arts and industries. Biological

principles dominate medicine and surgery. Bacteriology, brewing, and many

allied subjects are based upon the study of microscopic organisms. Economic

entomology is making its value felt in agriculture. Along all these and other

lines there is a great future opening up before biology, a future of extended use-

--fulness, of popular appreciation, and of value to the nation and not the least

important of these technical applications will, I am convinced, be that of zoology

--to our fishing industries. When we consider their enormous annual value about

eight millions sterling at first hand to the fisherman, and a great deal more than

that by the time the products reach the British public, when we remember the

very large proportion of our population who make their living directly or

indirectly (as boatbuilders, net-makers, &c.) from the fisheries, and the still larger

proportion who depend for an important element in their food supply upon these

--industries ; when we think of what we pay other countries France, Holland,
--Norway for oysters, mussels, lobsters, &c., which we could rear in this country

if our sea-shores  and our sea-bottom were properly cultivated                                                                                                                                                                                    and when we
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

remember that fishery cultivation or aquiculture is applied zoology, we can readily

realise the enormous value to the nation which this direct application of our

--science will one day have perhaps I ought rather to say, we can scarcely realise

the extent to which zoology may be made the guiding science of a great national

industry. The flourishing shell-fisli industries of France, the oyster culture at

Arcachon and Marennes, and the mussel culture by bouchots in the Bay of

Aiguillon, show what can be done as the result of encouragement and wise assist-

ance from Government, with constant industry on the part of the people, directed

by scientific knowledge. In another direction the successful hatching of large

numbers (hundreds of millions) of cod and plaice by Captain Dannevig in Norway,

and by the Scottish Fishery Board at Dunbar, opens up possibilities of immense

--practical value iu the way of restocking our exhausted bays and fishing banks

depleted by the over-trawling of the last few decades.

The demand for the produce of our seas is very great, and would probably pay

well for an increased supply. Our choicer fish and shellfish are becoming rarer,

and the market prices are rising. The great majority of our oysters are imported

from France, Holland, and America. Even in mussels we are far from being able

to meet the demand. In Scotland alone the long line fishermen use nearly a

hundred millions of mussels to bait their hooks every time all the lines are set,

and they have to import annually many tons of these mussels at a cost of

from 2,1. to .3/. 10s. a ton. If 'squid' (cuttlefish) could be obtained in sufficient

quantity, it would probably be even more valuable than mussels as liait, but its

price is usually prohibitive. I happen to know that a fishing firm in Aberdeen

paid during this last winter over 200/. for squid bait for a single boat's lines for

the three months October to December, and there are fifty to sixty of such boats

north of the Tyne. Here is a nice little industry ready for anyone who can
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   '

capture or cultivate the common squid in quantity.

Whether the wholesale introduction of the French method of mussel culture,

by means of bouchots, on to our shores would be a financial success is doubtful.

Material and labour are dearer here, and beds, scars, or scalps seem, on the whole,

better fitted to our local  conditions                                                                                                   but as innumerable young        mussels all                                                              round
                                                                             ;

our coasts perish miserably every year for want of suitable objects to attach to,

there can be no reasonable doubt that the judicious erection of simple stakes or

plain bouchots would serve a useful purpose, at anj^ rate in the collection of seed,

even if the further rearing be carried on by means of the bed system.

All such aquicultural processes require, however, in addition to the scientific

knowledge, sufficient capital. They cannot be successfully carried out on a small

scale. When the zoologist has once shown as a laboratory experiment, in the zoo-

logical station, that a particular thing can be done--that this fish can be hatched or
     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.               711

that shellfish can he reared iiuder certain conditions which promise tohe an industrial
success, then the matter should be carried out by the Qo^·ernment ' or by capitalists
on a sufficiently lai-ge scale to remove the risk of results being vitiated by tem-
porary accident or local variation in the conditions. It is contrary, however, to
our English traditions for Government to help in such a matter, and if our local
Sea-Fisheries Committees have not the necessary powers nor the available funds,
there remains a splendid opportunity for opulent landowners to erect sea-fish hatch-
eries on the shores of their estates, and for the rich merchants of our great cities to
establish aquiculture in their neighbouring estuaries, and by so doing instruct the
fishing populations, resuscitate the declining industries, and cultivate the barren

--shores in all reasonable probability to their own ultimate profit.

     In addition to the farming of our shores there is a great deal to be done in
promoting the fishing industries on the inshore and oft'shore grounds .along our
coast, and in connection with such work the first necessity is a thorough scientific
exploration of our British seas by means of a completely equipped dredging and
trawling expedition. Such exploration can only be done in little bits, spasmodi-

cally, by private enterprise. From the time of Edward Forbes it has been the

delight of British marine zoologists to explore, by means of dredging from yachts or
hired vessels during their holidays, whatever areas of the neighbouring seas were
open to them. Some of the greatest names in the roll of our zoologists, and some
of the most creditable work in British zoology, will always be associated with

dredging expeditions. Forbes, Wyville Thomson, Carpenter, Gwyn Jefireys,

--M'Intosh, and Norman one can scarcely think of them without recalling^

' Hurrah for the dredge, with its iron edge,

And its mystical triangle,

And its hided net, with meshes set.

Odd  lishes  to  entangle  !    ^

                              '

Much good pioneer work in exploration has been done in the past by these and
other naturalists, and much is now being done locally by committees or associa-

--tions by the Dublin Royal Society on the West of Ireland, by the Marine Biolo-

gical Association at Plymouth, by the Fishery Board iu Scotland, and by the

Liverpool Marine Biology Committee in the Irish Sea ; but few zoologists or

--zoological committees have the means, the opportunity, the time to devote along
--with their professional duties to that detailed systematic survey of our whole

British sea-area which is really required. Those who have not had exjierience of
it can scarcely realise how much time, energy, and money it requires to keep up a
series of dredging expeditions, how many delays, disappointments, expt^nsive acci-
dents and real hardships there are, and how often the naturalist is tempted to leave

unprofitable ground, which ought to be carefully worked over, for some more

favoured spot where he knows he can count upon good spoil. And yet it is
very necessary that the whole ground good or bad though it may be from the

-- --zoological point of view should be thoroughly surveyed, physically aud biologi-

cally, in order that we may know the conditions of existence which en\iron our

fishes, on their feeding grounds, their spawning grounds, their ' nurseries,' or

wherever they may be.

     The British Government has done a noble piece of work which will redound to its

everlasting credit in providing for, and carrying out, the ' Challenger ' expedition.

Now that that great enterprise is completed, aud that the whole scientific world is

"united in appreciation of the results obtained, it would be a glorious consequence,

and surely a very wise action in the interests of the national fisheries, for the
Government to fit out an expedition, iu charge of two or thi'ee zoologists and fish-

   ' We require in England a Central Board or Government Department of Fisheries,

composed in part of seienlitic experts, and that not merely for the purpose of
imposing and enforcing regulations, but still more, in order that research into Fish-
eries problems maj' be instituted and aquicultural experiments carried out.

eries experts, to spend a couple of years in exploring' more systematically than Las

yet been done, or can otherwise be done, our British coasts from the Laminarian zone

down to the deep mud. No one could be better fitted to organise and direct such

an expedition than Dr. John Murray.

Such a detailed survey of the bottom and of the surface waters, of their condi-

tion and their contents, at all times of the year for a couple of years, would give

us the kind of information we requii-e for the solution of some of the more difficult

--fishery problems such as, the extent and causes of the wanderings of our fishes,

which ' nurseries ' are supplied by particular spawning grounds, the reason of the

sudden disappearance of a fish such as the haddock from a locality, and in eeneral

the history of our food fishes throughout the year. It is creditable to our Govern-

--ment to have done the pioneer work in exploring the great oceans, but surely it

would be at least equally creditable to them and perha])S more directly and im-

--mediately profitable, if they look for some such return from scientific work to

explore our own seas and our own sea-fisheries.

     There is still another subject connected wilh the fisheries which ihe biologist

--can do much to elucidate I mean the diseases of edible animals and the efi'ect

upon man of the various diseased conditions. It is well known that the consump-

tion of mussels taken from stagnant or impure water is sometimes followed by

severe symptoms of irritant poisoning which may result in rapid death. This

'musselling' is due to tlie presence of an organic alkaloid or ptomaine, in the liver

of the mollusc, formed doubtless by a micro organism in tlie impure water. It is

clearly of the greatest importance to determine accurately under what conditions

the mussel can become infected by the micro-organism, in what stage it is injurious

to man, and whether, as is supposed, steeping in pure water with or without the

addition of carbonate of soda will render poisonous mussels fit for food.

During this last year there has been an outcry, almost amounting to a scare,

and seriously affecting the mai'ket,' as to the supposed connection between oysters

taken from contaminated water and typhoid fever. This, like the musselling, is

myclearly a case for scientific investigation, and, with  colleague Professor Boyce,

I have commenced a series of experiments and observations, partly at the Port
Erin Biological Station, where we liave oysters laid down on diflerent parts of the

shore under very diftiprent conditions, as well as in dishes and tanks, and partly at

University College, Liverpool.

Our object is to determine the effect of various conditions of water and bottom

upon the life and health of the oyster, the effect of the addition of various im-

purities to the water, the conditions under which the oyster becomes infected with

the typhoid Bacillus, and the resulting effect upon the oyster, the period during

which the oyster remains infectious, and lastly, whether any simple practicable

measures can be taken (1) to determine whether an oj'ster is infected with typhoid,

and (2) to render such an oyster innocuous to man. As Professor Boyce and I

propose to lay a paper upon this subject before the Section, I sliall not occupy

further time now by a statement of our methods and results.

I have probably already sufficiently indicated to you the extent and impoi'tance

of the applications of our science to practical questions connected with our fishing

industries. But if the zoologist has great opportunities for usefulness, he ought

always to bear in mind that he has also grave responsibilities in connection with
Fisheries investigations. Much depends upon the results of his work. Private
enterprise, public opinion, local regulations, and even imperial legislation may all

be affected by his decisions. He ought not lightly to come to conclusions upon
weighty matters. I am convinced that of all the varied lines of research in modern

zoology, none contains problems more interesting and intricate than those of Bio-

nomics, Oceanography, and the Fisheries, and of these three series the problems

connected with our Fisheries are certainly not the least interesting, not the least

intricate, and not the least important in their bearing upon the welfare of man-

kind.

    ' I am told that between December and March the oyster trade decreased 75

per cent.

is considered, and, after comparison with certain other birds, some suggestions are
made as to the probable affinities of the genus. Phororhacos is regarded as a true
carinate bird, in which, as in the dodo, aphanapteryx, and many others, the wings
have undergone reduction through disuse. It seems to have been a highly
specialised form, aud probably has left no direct descendants : its nearest relatives
may perhaps be found among the Gruiformes, especially in the Psophiidje and
Dicholophi, aud it possibly represents a specialised offshoot from the generalised

stock which gave rise to these forms. No special affinities with the living Ratitte
are found, aud it appears very doubtful whether Gastornis is any way related.

    The other genera described by Ameghino are much less completely known

some of them, however, difl'er so, considerably from Phororhacos, and in several cases
from one another, that they should probably be referred to several distinct families,
as, indeed, has already been done by Moreno and Merrerat. The Stereornithes, there-
fore, appear to include a somewhat heterogeneous group of birds, whose chief points
of resemblance seem to lie in their lai'ge size and more or less reduced power
of flight. The unfortunate absence of specimens of these interesting fossils from
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  715

the European museums renders any detailed comparison with existing forms im-
possible, so tliat the opinions expressed in the present paper must he regarded as

provisional only.

10. Some Facts and Reflections draimi from a Study of Budding in

      Compound Ascidians. By Professor W. E. Hitter {University of

         California).

     Numerous recent writers have doubted the genetic unily of the compound
ascidians ; i.e., they have doubted whether tlieir property of budding, the cha-
racter which all agree to be the final test of whether an ascidian is simple or com-
pound, has not been acquired more than once. Of these authors I may mention
Lacaze-Duthiers, E. van Beneden, Herdman, 8eeliger, Lahille, and Sluitei'.

     In discussing the subject van Beneden has made the apt remark that no zoolo-
gist would think of uniting all bud-producing actinians in one group and placing
them over against all others that do not reproduce in this manner. In his weU-
known report on the compound ascidians of the ' Challenger ' Expedition, Professor
Herdman not only reached the conclusion that the group is polyphyletic in origin,
but he also marshalled his broad knowledge to show that they probably originated
at three distinct points from the simple ascidians, and to show also what genera
trace their origin back to each of these three starting-points. The author regarded
this as one of the most important generalisations reached by his study of the great

' Challenger ' collection.

     Quite recently M. Lahille has proposed an entirely new classification of the

Tunicata, in which he ignores budding as a diagnostic character of at most greater
than generic importance. That, however, this writer has treated the matter too
lightly, whether regarded from a morphological or a physiological point of view,
"will, I apprehend, be allowed by most students of the group.

    It is not my purpose to discuss here a classification of the compound ascidians

based on the hypothesis of their polyphyletic origin, but rather to show, first,
that they have had such an origin, and, secondl}', to consider certain developmental

probabilities that are involved in, or, rather, are the necessary results of, such an

hypothesis.

    In the interest of brevity and clearness my discussion will aim almost entirely

at showing that two genera of compound ascidians are, structurally considered,
considerably more unlike each other than each is unlike a genus of simple ascidians
which, in turn, are widely separated from each other.

     The genera to which I refer are rerophora and Goodsiria as representatives of
the compound ascidians, and Ascidia and Folycarpn as representing the simple

ascidians.

     Definitely stated the proposition to be established is this : Perophora and Good-
siria are less closely related to each other than on the one hand Perophora is to
Ascidia, and on the other Goodsiria is to Polycarpa.

   We will first compare the several genera anatomically, and afterwards the

budding in Perophora and Goodsiria ; and we may begin with Polycarpa and

Goodsiria. Polycarpa is closely related to Cynthia, and still more closely to
Styela. The genus is, however, distinctly separated from Cynthia, particularly by
its possessing simple tentacles and sexual organs in the form of so-called polycarps.

     Goodsiria belongs to the Polystyelidae, a small family of compound ascidians,
founded b}' Professor Herdman for the reception of several genera that are, as our
knowledge now stands, closely related to one another, and well separated from all
other compound ascidians, although they certainly have rather close affinities with

the Botryllidaj.

     The close similarity in structure between Polycarpa and the Polystyelida; has

been recognised by nearly all investigators who haA'e studied them, and my own

work has, I think, shown their kinship to be even closer than has heretofore been

supposed. In fact, the resemblance is so close between an undescribed species of
716 KEPOKT-- 1895.

Polycarpa which I have found on our Califoinian coast and Gooihiria dura from

the same locality that I am sure no zoolojrist would ever think of recognising

more than a specific diflerence between them, did not the one reproduce by budding

--while the other does not. Two points, however, must be briefly dwelt upon one

of resemblance, the other of difference.

It is well known that the hj'pophyseal duct in ascidians is usually situated on

the ventral side of the ganglion; but it is also well known that Botry llusfoims an

exception to this rule, lor in this species the duct is doisal to the (janglion. 1 find

that Goodsiria agrees with Botryllm \\\ this peculiarity. I also find that the only

species of Polycarpa which I have examined with reference to the point, viz.,

Polycarpa pomaria, possesses the same unusual character. In some cases, at least,

it is well nigh, if not wholly, impossible to ascertain the relation of the duct to

the ganglion without the aid of sections. It appears to me, consequently, that the

occurrence of this very exceptional condition in both Polycarpa and Goodsiria,

when considered together with their many other close resemblances, adds consider-

able weight to the belief in their close kinship.

The difference to which I refer is the presence usually of well-marked folds in

the branchial sac of Polycarpa and the rudimentary condition or entire absence

of these folds in Goodsiria. In the sfic of Goodsiria dura there is no trace of folds

proper, but two of the five internal longitudinal vessels on each side of the sac are

Adistinctly nearer together than are the others.   similar approximation of these

vessels where no true folds exist occurs in numerous sjiecies of ascidians, and

Herdman has given good reasons for regarding it as evidence of folds that have

been lost. The vessels are usually crowded on the folds more than elsewhere
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the folds in some cases disappear, but the crowded vessels, being a deeper

Nowmorphological character, persist though on a plain surface.  it can be shown

that in genera whore these folds are present as a rule, but where they may be

rudimentary or absent, it is, in a gener.rl way, in the larger species that they are

best developed, and in the smaller ones that they are rudimentary or absent.

From this fact and others I am di''2>osed to look upon Goodsiria as a pigmy

Polycarpa.

Next, concerning the structural likenesses between Ascidia and Perophora,

they are close in most points and not remote in any. Perhaps the most important

difference is found in the branchial sncs, but this difference is interesting. Ascidia

has internal longitudinal vessels which are papillated, while Perophora has no

internal longitudinal vessels ; but it does have long interserial papillae, each of

w^hich is provided with two processes of variable length, one directed anteriorly,

Nowthe other posteriorly.  if these processes on one series of the papillse were to

reach across and unite with the corresponding ones of an adjacent series of papillae,

internal papillated longitudinal vessels would be produced entirely similar to those

existing in Ascidia. Suggestively enough, individuals of at least two species of

Perophora have been observed in which just such a union does exist. From this

it would appear that the lateral processes of the papillae in Perophora are remnants

of internal longitudinal vessels ; and this fact, taken in connection with others,

inclines me to regard Perophora as a pigmy Ascidia, just as we have seen that

Goodsiria may be regarded as a pigmy Polycarpa.

In comparing Goodsiria and Perophora on the one hand and Polycarpa and

Ascidia on the other, we find a marked contrast in each case in nearly every organ

of the body.

Turning to reproduction by gemmation, the buds of Perojjhora are produced

by a proliferous stolon, while tho^e of Goodsiria are I'ormed directly from the body

of the parent zooids, the inner layer of the bud being an evagination of the parietal

wall of the peribrancbial sac. Are these two methods of origin of buds reducible

to a common type ? I may say at once that a conclusive answer to this query is

not yet possible, for the reason that we do not know how the first bud, i.e., the bud

from the embryozooid, arises in either genus.

I cannot leave this part of the subject without saying a single word about the

epicardium, a structure that is certainly of much importance in connection with

thft budding of many compound ascidians. The only structures in Goodsiria that
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.          717

could possibly be called by this name are two broad, shallow pouches at the

posterior end of the peribranchial sacs, one for each side. i?hey certainly

have nothing whatever to do with the budding, since the buds arise about as
far away from them as the size of the ascidiozooids will permit. Furthermore,
they do not have the same relations as tlie epicardium of Clavelina and other

ascidiaus. In Goodsiria and Botryllus, I may add, they are merely parts of
the peribranchial sacs ; while in other cases they arise in a definite way irom the

branchial sac.

     In uiy opinion it is an unjustifiable and purposeless forcing of things to attempt

to see anything in either Goodsiria or Botri/Uus that is homologous with the
epicardium of Clavelina and other budding ascidians.

     Relying chiefly on the evidence from adult structure, we are, then, as it seems
to me, obliged to conclude that the compound ascidians have arisen from the
simple ones by at least two distinct groups of these latter having independently
acquired the property of reproduction by budding. Now, since the processes of
evolution are of quite as much scientific interest to us as are its products, we can

hardly avoid an attempt to gain some insight into the developmental processes

that have been in operation in this instance.

One question we are impelled to ask is whether some cause for the origin of

buddinc in these animals may not be detected here, where it, whatever it is, has
Abeen so potent as to produce its eflect twice.
                                                 possible cause does suggest itself,

and I venture to present it to you very briefly. I confess, however, that the

venture is made not without some trepidation.

It will be remembered that we have given reasons for regarding Goodsiria and

Ferophora as simplified or pigmy Polycarpse and Ascidite respectively. It seems

to me possible that budding might have arisen in these genera of simple ascidians

as a result of the diminution in size and simplification in structure of some of the

species ; and I am disposed to regard the diminution in size as the most important

factor. It appears to me that the smallest species of Poh/cnrpa, for example, have

a much poorer chance of survival than do the larger and largest ones, owing to

the simple circumstance that they cannot produce anything like so large a number

of embryos as do the larger species. The smallest species that I know of this

genus is only 3 or 4 millimetres in length, while most of the species reach some

centimetres at least in length ; and it is a matter of common observation that in

the ascidians the size of the ovary and the number of the ova are in direct propor-

tion to the size of the parent individuals. It is certain that the total volume of

the sexual products of a large I'olycarpa would be many times greater than the

entire animal of the small species to which I have just referred ; and the ova in the

one case are not much, if at all, larger in the one than in the other. The suggestion

is that in these cases budding has in some xcay arisen as a compensation for the

diminished power of sexual reproduction.

   A developmental question of wider moment than the one just disposed of, and

one which I discuss with much gi'eater confidence, is this. If blastogenesis has

had two or more wholly independent origins among ascidians, how is the close

similarity in the development of the blastozooids of the whole group to be

explained? The interest of this question is greatly increased by the fact that not

only is the development of the blastozooids much alike in all the species, but also

that this development is quite unique as compared with the development of the

embi-yozooid.

     In contrasting the development from an embryo and from a bud it is seen that
in einhri/onic development the ectoderm produces the matrix of the test, the peri-
branchial sacs, and the central nercons si/stevi and hypophysial duct, while in the

bud we see these four parts of the animal produced by the inner or so-called endo-

dermic vesicle.

     Concerning the endodermic, or ratlier inner vesicle origin of the ganglion and

hypophysial duct, I speak with perfect confidence as regards Goodsiria and

Perophora, for this confidence rests on my own observations. The case for the

Goodsiria bud in particular is as clear as anyone could wish a developmental

fact to be.
--718 REPORT 1895.

Enough of the facts are now before us to enahle us to state the problem clearly.

If the property of budding has been independently acquired by two quite widely
separated groups of simple ascidians, how has it come about that the development

of the blastozooids agrees so closely, and in such remarkable jjeculiarities, as the

orioin of the nervous system, and the peribranchial sac from the outer layer of the

evxbryo and from the inner layer of the hud ?

    I believe the answer to be that we have before us an excellent case of develop-
mental opportunism. The inner layer of the bud gives origin to nearly all the

ort^ans of the blastozooid because physiological influences working to such a course

of development have been stronger than the hereditary influences tending to make

the development follow the embryonic method.

    The case is particularly interesting because, as I believe, we are able to put our

fino-er on the physiological cause that has been so potent in modifying the directmi,

not thejinal result of the mighty force of heredity.

You will remember that the outer layer of the embryo produces the matrix of
Kowthe test, the nervous system, and the peribranchial sacs.
                                                              observe. The pro-

duction of the two last-mentioned structures is a jmrely developmental matter. It

concerns the embryonic period only. The organs become separated, or practically

 so, from their source during this period, and the outer layer has nothing more to
' do with them, at least functionally. Not so with the production of the test. This

is not merely an embryonic matter ; it is an enduring physiological matter.

The test must be constantly renewed throughout the life of the individual. The

outer laver is consequently an active secretory organ from an early embryonal

period to the end of the animal's life ; and since the outer layer of the bud is

merely a portion of the outer layer of the parent or of the stolon, as the case may

be, it is at no time an einhryonic layer ; it is, from the very beginning, a differ-

entiated organ. It has to grow, to be sure ; but in addition it has a well-

established and important physiological function to perform. Very difl^erent is it

--with the inner layer. Its cells are strictly undifferentiated embryonic, if you

will. They do not even have to digest their own food, for they are constantly

bathed in the maternal blood. The layer does not come in contact with the

external world at any time or at any point. It has nothing to do but to develop.

Why should it not relieve the outer layer from producing some of the parts that

it produces in the embryo ? And it does.

I must hasten to say that this physiological explanation of the peculiarities of

ascidian bud development was suggested by Seeliger, though he did not make as

much of it as I believe it deserves.

There are several other instances among budding animals where I am inclined

to think that assignable functional influences have more or less radically changed

the method of development, but time prevents reference to more than one of

these. Chun has very recently shown that in liathkea octojmnctata , one of the

Medusae, the inner layer of the parent takes no part whatever in the formation of

the bud. The buds are produced on the wall of the stomach, and it appears to

me highly probable that the ectoderm alone shares in the process, because the

endoderm is so completely^ given over to the digestive function, while the ectoderm

cells have much more largely retained their undifferentiated condition owing to

their being in great measure protected from the external world by the sub-

umbrella.

                  11. Outlines of a neto Classification of the Ttmicata.

By Walter Garstang, 3f.A., F.Z.S., Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford.

     Professor Herdman's classification of the Tunicata is based very largely upon
modifications of external form connected with gemmation and the formation of
colonies. It involves, as Professor Herdman himself admits, an unnatural separa-
tion of forms admittedly allied, e.g., Fyrosoma and Doliolum, Claielina and the
Distomidse, Diazona and Ciona, as well as to an rmnatural approximation of forms
whose structure is altogether dissimilar, e.g., Fyrosoma and Ccclocorinus, Terophora
and Claoelina.

Laliille has promulg-ated a system based upon modifications of the structure of

the pharynx. His arrangement of the fixed ascidians seems to me admirable, but
his treatment of the pelagic forms is most unsatisfactory. He follows Herdmau in
placing Pyrosoma near Cwlocormm and the Didemnidfe, tliough upon different and

purely speculative grounds. 8alpa is divorced from Duliolum through an erroneous

interpretation of the ciliated pits on the gill of Salpa.

The subjoined scheme is based upon anatomical and embryological facts. The

pelagic caducichordate types possess a single row of undivided branchial slits

(protostigmata). This condition is recapitulated, as I have elsewhere shown, in

the ontogeny of various fixed ascidians, but the protostigmata of the young post-
larval form are subsequently subdivided into rows of minute secondary stigmata.
The structure of Pyrosoma and its allies is thus more primitive than that of any

of the fixed ascidians.

The two groups, Thaliacea and Ascidiacea, are distinguished in my scheme
Myupon this basis.
                         subdivision of the Thaliacea explains itself; that of the

Ascidiacea I have adopted, with some modifications, from Lahille.

    Our knowledge of this remarkable group of extinct flesh eaters has been of

give us an accurate insight into the structure and relationships of several of the
more important genera.

     The creodonta are almost exclusively Eocene forms, and especially characterise

720 REPORT-- 1895.

the Lower Eocene, the Wasatch heing probably their time of culmination, while

only one genus (JIy<e>iodoii) is known to pass into the Miocene. The appearance

of five distinctly difterentiated families in the Puerco indicates that their origin is
to be looked for in the Cretaceous formation. North America was eminently the

home of the group, having many more genera and families than Europe has yet

yielded. So far, none are known from the southern hemisphere.

Though including several divergent lines of differentiation, the group is

characterised by a fairly uniform structure. The incisors and canines are of the

carnivorous type, and rarely are reduced in number ; the sectorials are either absent

or present  in  more  than  one pair  (except  in  the  Miacidce)                                               the molars generally
                                                                                                             ;

retain the tritubercular plan more or less distinctly. The milk dentition is of the

same cliai-acter as in the true carnivora. The brain is small and the hemispheres

usually little convoluted. The skull has a very long slender cranial part, with

deep postorbital constriction, very prominent sagittal and occipital crests, and a

short facial region. The vertebne are remarkable for the complex zygapophyses

on the lumbars and posterior thoracics. The limbs are relatively short and light,

the humerus retaining the epicondylar foramen, and the femur the third trochanter.

The feet are weak and almost invariably plantigrade and pentadactyl, and with

only one known exception, the scaphoid, lunar, and central remain separate. The

ungual phalanges are very generally cleft at the tip, as in the iusectivora.

The creodonts fall quite naturally into two sections, one with more or less

blunt and tuberculated teeth, and the other with trenchant teeth. The first section,

which includes three families, the Arctocyonidse, Triisodontidae and Mesonychidse,

is most abundant in the Puerco, and has but a single representative in the Middle

and Upper Eocene. No existing forms appear to have been derived from the

creodonts with tuberculate teeth.

The second section includes five families, the Proviverridaj, Oxysenidte, liyEeno-

dontidse, Palaeonictidse, and Miacidte, the last of which is very sharply dis-

tinguished from all other creodonts, and forms the connecting link with the true

carnivora. The creodonts with trenchant teeth are most important and highly

developed in the Wasatch and Bridger, after which they decline, their place being

gradually taken by the carnivores.

Most of the fissipede carnivora would seem to be clearly derivable from the

Miacidcc, except the cats, the origin of which is still obscure, and which are

remarkable for the extremely rapid specialisation which they attain at a very early

period. The Pinnipedia, on the other hand, would seem to have been derived

from some other creodont family. Wortman has suggested, with considerable

probability, that the Oxycenida- were tlie ancestors of the Pinnipedes, but the gap

between the two is yet so great as to render this uncertain.

   1. On some Results of Scientific Investigation as applied to Fisheries.
                      By Professor W. C. JVI'Intosh, F.R.S.

    My remarks are based' on experience mainly, but not altogether, gained in

Scotland, but are applicable to the empire, or indeed to European fisheries. The
greater responsibility has been felt, since England possesses no public department
precisely corresponding to the Fishery Board for Scotland. It may be pointed

out that such investigations in i-egard to the fisheries are of so recent a date that
perhaps it is too early to estimate comprehensively the results ; but since there are

--hostile critics it may be well to take a general survey of the results often gained

under considerable difiiculty, especially in regard to sea-going ships, for only a
small steam vessel has been at the service of the Fishery Board, instead of a
powerful vessel capable of going to distant grounds in rough weather. Previous
                                             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                           721

to 1883 no statistics of a reliable kind, other than those of herrings and salted

fishes, were available to guide the Legislature as to whether marine fisheries were

diminishing, stationary, or increasing. This anomalous state of things permitted

indulgence in exaggerated statements as to the scarcity of fishes, and the decline,

or, as it was said, impending ruin of the fisheries. While thus a very great im-

provement had been made, the returns were far from being complete. They give
the greater part of the fishes caught, but left many unreported. If anything is

national property it is the saa, and it ought to be comparatively an easy task

to give an account of its stewardship.

     In the scientific report to the Royal Commission of 1884 the closing of certain

--bays against beam and otter trawling was indicated thus: 'The experiment of

allowing a bay having a definite boundary and suitable for observation to remain

unfished for several years either by line, trawl, or stake-net would perhaps be

more satisfactory' (than a close time). 'Its fish fauna would be carefully

examined at closure, and frequently during the period, and the general increase

in size, emigration, and immigration of the fishes noted. Advantage might be

taken at the same time to increase the number of its valuable food-fishes, e.g.,

turbot and soles, by artificial means. Such an experiment would give a valuable

basis for future legislation, tend to increase our knowledge of the food-fishes in a

remarkable degree, and would be worthy of the interests which this country has

in the department of sea fisheries.' It was afterwards arranged to leave out the
line fishermen, since many of the older men with small boats would have suffered

hardship                                     and, after some years' observations, the  Fishery Board decided  to  close
                                          ;

all the water within the three-mile limit, besides certain larger areas. These

closures were made, rightly or wrongly, on the faith of the scientific experiments

made by the Board. The investigations also showed from 1884 onwards that the

three-mile limit was insuflicient to protect the spawning fishes, which, as a rule,

were beyond that area. Investigation has also cleared up the migrations of fishes.

In shallow bays ripe plaice are seldom found, almost all occurring in the deeper

water beyond the three-mile limit. Yet the number of young plaice in such areas

is prodigious, the eggs and young being wafted into the shallower water. There

they grow till they reach a size of 10 to 13 inches, when they seek the outer

waters, in which to attain maturity and to grow to full size. This explains

the occurrence of the enormous number of these fishes in so limited an area, as, for
instance, in St. Andrews Bay, and their survival after the use of the most exten-

sive and persistent means of capture. Similarly, while the cod spawns are in
the off-shore waters, the very young forms, ranging from \ in. to an inch, appear
in the in-shore grounds in June, haunt the borders of the tidal rocks for some

time, and again return to breed in deep water. On the other hand, the very young

haddock is an off-shore fish ; and so is the very young ling, the latter, when

from three to seven inches, migrating shorewards and returning to deep water for

adult life. Scientific investigation has shown the enormous fecundity of food-

fishes, as well as the provision by which only a portion of the roe ripens at a

given time. With wise regulations, therefore, our waters might always be relied
Weon for supplies.
                                             have largely increased our knowledge of the sizes of" the respec-

tive sexes of marine fishes at maturity, and the development of the eggs in the

roe, and their numerical proportion to each other. In this work no one had done

more valuable service than l)r. Fulton, the Scientific Superintendent of the Fishery

Board for Scotland, and the subject has been further elucidated by Mr. J. T. Cun-

ningham, Mr. Calderwood, and Mr. Holt. Such knowledge in regard to Scotland

--made it clear that the legislative proposal of a size-limit of 10 or 12 inches below

--which fishes were to be unsaleable would be no protection, for instance, to a ripe

plaice, though it might tend to preserve the species till it reached somewhat deeper

waters. No feature, again, has been more prominently brought out by scientific

investigation than the fact that the eggs of almost all our food-fishes float, or are

pelagic. Their wide distribution is thus provided for, and they are beyond the

possibility of injury by net or trawl. In 1884 both the eggs and the young of food-

fishes were, as a rule, wrapt in mystery. Now the eggs and larval stages of most

have been described and figured, notably by Professor E. Prince, Mr. Cunningham,

1895.                                                                                                         3a

and Mr. Holt, and the growtli in many cases followed to the adult condition.

This experience, especially at St. Andrews, lias demonstrated tlie comparative

ease with which immense numbers of the eggs of valuable food-fishes can be

artificially hatched and then placed in the sea. The Fishery Board's Marine

Hatchery at Dunbar has done this on a large scale. Last J'ear it was shown at

Oxford that about twenty-seven millions of larval plaice, besides cod and flounders,

were placed in the sea. This year about 38,615,000 larval plaice, 3,800,000 larval

turbot, 2,760,000 larval end, 2,-500,000 larval lemon-dabs (often sold as soles),

besides 600,000 larval dabs and flounders, and 450,000 larval haddock and

whiting were ' planted,' making a total for the year of 48,725,000 fishes. The

total for the two years is thus 75,285,000 fry placed in the sea, wliile the

mortality was very small. Comparing this result with the totals and the expendi-

ture on the other side of the Atlantic, it has been found that in two seasons the

economically managed Scotch establishment pressed closely on the grand totals of

twelve or thirteen years' work. The Americans, moreover, chiefly deal with the

cod, a fish more easily manipulated, and which produces a far greater number of

eggs than the plaice; and the same might be said of the Norwegians. The turbot

and lemon-dab, again, are valuable tishes I'or the first time artificially hatched on

a large scale. Dr. Fulton and the staft' under him have thus made great progress.

English soles liave been successfully transferred to Scottish waters, many having

been carried long distances, as from the Lancashire coast, where they were

obtained through the courtesy of Professor Herdman. The distribution of the food-

fishes has been carefully investigated at various stages, as well as their capture by

the diSerent instruments used in fishing, especially in connection with the variously

sized meshes and hooks. Experiments on the vitality of the fishes after capture

by trawl or by hook have also been made. Our knowledge with regard to the food

of fishes has been largely increased and grouped under two heads : (1) food which

is the product of the locality, and for the most part developed on the bottom
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and (2) food which is floating or pelagic, and which might be brought consider-

able distances by currents. The food of fishes to a large extent primarily depended

on plant-life, a wonderful cycle passing from diatom or algoid through the lower

animal forms to fishes. Much information has also been ascertained on the subject

of close times, as applied both to the herring and white fishes, and is available

for legislative purposes. The majority of the mussel beds of Scotland, and some of

those in England, have been surve3'ed and reported on, and the whole question put

--on a new footing founded on an accurate knowledge of the reproductions of the

Amussel, for which we are mainly indebted to Dr. J. Hardie Wilson.  series of

observations have likewise been made on oysters with a view to resuscitate

exhausted beds, e.g., those of the Forth, where careless administration has

reduced an income of 15,000^. or more a year to 148/., and this witbin less than a

generation. Various cockle and clam beds have been similarly surveyed, and

suggestions made for their conservation and improvement. Experiments in regard

to the hatchings of lobsters have been made at Brodielc, in Arran, and at Dunbar,

and their development is being studied by Dr. Fullerton. Otlier experiments

have been made on the preservation of hair after it was placed on the hooks, and

Analso on the preservation of herrings and white fishes.  important series of

physical observations has been carried out iu the North Sea as to temperatures,

currents, and other features of the water, the relations of these to the fishing

grounds and the migrations of fishes. Lastly, a commencement has been made in

determining the proportional number of the sexes of salmon entering the rivers at,

various periods, and their external diU'erences, the determination of when and

to what extent the muscles undergo chanpes during the growth of the roe and

milt, so as to clear up the subject of the deterioration of the fish as food. The

structure of the alimentary canal of the fish in connection witli its cessation to

feed and other points ai'e also being studied. These complex investigations

are in the hands of Mr. T. Tosh at Berwick-on-Tweed, Dr. Noel Paton, and the

staff of the College of Physicians' Laboratory, Edinburgh, and in those of Dr.

Alex. Brown, Aberdeen. Some persons think that the Universities, and not

the Government, shoul dcarry out such investigations ; but it need scarcely be said

that the Universities have neither the means, the ships, nor the experienced staff

distributed along the coast line and iu constant touch with the subject, for
Aefficiently dealing with it.
                               public department alone is capable of undertaking

it with success, as the practice of other nations from America to Japan abun"-

dantly testifies.

        4. Oyster Cultural Methods, Experiments and New Proposals.
           By Bashford Dean, Assistant U.S. Fishery Commission.

      The author spoke of the difficulties in spat collecting, and of some recent sug-
gestions as to their obviation ; of the lack of delinite knowledge as to the most

favourable physical conditions of the oyster's set ; of questions of aeration, density,

temperature, and silt deposit of the water during the spawning season. He referred

to the difficulty in retaining the embryos in bcnsins and in determining the duration
of the motile stage. The suggestiveness of the mare piccolo and of the closed
lake of Brineguy .- the experiments in spat collecting of Eice, Saint-Sauveur, and
more recent culturists, and the possible defects of the cultural methods lately
patented in tlie Urdted States were also discussed.

5. On Oysters and Typhoid: an experimented Inquiry into the effect ujwn

      the Oyster of various external conditions, including Pathogenic Organ-

    isms. By RuBERT W. BoYCE, M.B., M.R.C.S., Professor of Pathology
    in University College, Liverpool ; and W. A. Herdman, D.Sc, F.R.S.,

      Professor of Zoology in University College, Liverpool.

     Our motives in undertaking this investigation liave been

      1. Purely scientific-- the elucidation of the life conditions of the oyster, both
under normal and abnormal environment.

  _ 2. Economic or technological--to trace the causes and eflTects of diseased con-
ditions, with the view of determining what basis exists for the recent 'Oyster and
typhoid ' scare, (a) in the interests of the oyster fisheries, and {h) in the interests of

the general public.

     A. The objects, in detail, we had in view in entering on the investigation were

as follows :

     1. To determine the conditions of life and health and growth of the oyster by
keeping samples in sea waters of difl'erent composition-- e.r/. it is a matter of dis-
cussion amongst 1:)ractical ostreiculturists as to what specific gravity or salinity of
water, and what amount of lime are best for the due proportionate growth of both
shell and body.

  --2. To determine the eflect of feeding oysters on various substances both

natural food such as Diatoms, and artificial food such as oatmeal. Here, again,
there is a want of agreement at present as to the benefit or otherwise of feeding

oysters in captivity.

     3 To determine the eflfect of adding various impurities to the water in which
the oysters are grown, and especially the efl'ect of sewage in various quantities. It
is notorious that oysters are sometimes grown or laid down for fattening purposes

                                                                                                           3a3

in water whicli is more or less contaminated by sewage, but it is still an open
question as to tbe resulting effect upon the oyster.

     4. To determine whether oysters not infected with a pathogenic organism, but
gi'own under insanitary conditions, have a deleterious effect when used as food by

animals.

     5. To determine the effect upon the oyster of infection with typhoid, both
naturally i.e. by feeding with sewage water containing typhoid stools, and artifi-
cially i.e. by feeding on a culture in broth of the typhoid organism.

   --6. To determine the fate of the typhoid bacillus in the oyster whether it is

confined to the alimentary canal, and whether it increases in any special part or

gives rise to any diseased conditions ; how long it remains in the alimentary canal

whether it remains and grows in the pallial cavity, on the surface of the mantle
and branchial folds; and whether it produces any altered condition of these parts
that can be recognised by the eye on opening the oyster.

     7. To determine whether an oyster can free its alimentary canal and pallial
cavity from the typhoid organism when placed in a stream of clean sea water; and,
if so, how long would be required, under average conditions^ to render infected

 oysters practically harmless.

     B. The methods which we employed in attaining these objects were as

follows :

     1. Observations upon oysters laid down in the sea, at Port Erin

              (a) Sunk in 5 fathoms in the bay, in pure water.

                (b) Deposited in shore pool, but in clean water,

             (c) Laid down in three diH'erent spots in more or less close proximity to
                      the main drain pipe, opening into the sea below low-water mark.

              These were to ascertain differences of fattening, condition, mortality, and
                      the acquisition of deleterious properties as the result of sewage con-

                         tamination.

     2. Observations upon oysters subjected to various abnormal conditions in the

laboratory.

         A(a) series of oysters placed in sea water and allowed to stagnate, in

                        order to determine effect of non-aeration.
               (b) Similar series in water kept periodically aerated.

          A(c) series placed in sea water to which a given quantity of fresh (tap)

                     water was added daily, to determine effect of reduction of salinity.

         A(d) seiies of oysters weighed approximately, and fed upon the follow-

                         ing substances, viz. :

                               (1) Oatmeal.
                                  (2) Flour.
                                 (3) Sugar.
                                 (4) Broth.
                               (5) Living Protophyta (Diatoms, Desmids, Algae).
                               (6) Living Protozoa (Infusoria, &c.).
                                (7) Earth.

              In this series of experiments the oysters were fed every morning and the
                     water aerated, but not changed (evaporation was compensated for
                    by the addition of a little tap water as required). The oysters were
                    weighed from time to time, and observations made upon the ap-
                      parently harmful or beneficial etl'ects of the above methods of

                         treatment.

     ' The oysters were kept in basins in cool rooms of constant temperature, shaded
from the sun, both at the Port Erin Biolosrical Station and also in the Pathological
and Zoological Laboratories at University College, Liverpool.

               (1) Healthy fecal matter.
              (2) Typhoid fecal matter.
              (3) Pure cultivations of the typhoid bacillus.

The oysters were carefully examined to determine their condition, with

       special reference to condition of branchite, alimentary canal, adductor

      muscle, and viscera generally. The contents of the rectum, as well as
       the water in the pallial cavity, were subjected to bacteriological
      analysis to determine the number of micro-organisms present, as well

        as the identitj- of the typhoid or other pathogenic organisms.

C. The following is a summary of the results obtained so far :

"We consider that these results are based upon tentative experiments, and serve

only to indicate further and definite lines of research. They must not be regarded

Weas conclusive.  feel strongly that all the experiments must be repeated and

e.xtended in several directions.

  --Our experiments demonstrate :

          I. The beneficial effects of aeration

                 (a) By the addition of air only
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

I (b) By change of water
                                                                                                                                                                              ;

pointing to the conclusion that the laying down of oysters in localities where there

is a good change of water, by tidal current or otherwise, should be beneficial.
     II. The diverse results obtained by feeding upon various substances, amongst

which the following may be noted. The e.xceedingly harmful action of sugar,

which caused the oysters to decrease in weight and die ; whilst the other substances
detailed above enabled them to maintain their weight or increase. The oysters
thrive best upon the living Protophyta and Protozoa. Those fed upon oatmeal and
flour after a time sickened and eventually died.

     III. The deleterious effects of stagnation, owing to the collection of excretory
products, growth of micro-organisms, and formation of scums upon the surface of

the water.

     IV. The toleration of sewage, etc. It was found that oyster* could, up to a
certain point, render clear sewage-contaminated water, and that they could live for
a prolonged period iu water rendered completely opaque by tlie addition of faecal
matter ; that the faecal matter obtained irom cases vf typhoid was more inimical
than that obtained from healthy subjects ; and that there was considerable tolera-

tion to peptonised broth.

     V. The infection of the oyster by the micro-organisms. The results of the
bacteriological examination of the water of the pallial cavity of the oyster, and of
the contents of the rectum, showed that in the cases of those laid down in the open
water of the bay the colonies present were especially small in number, whilst in
those laid down in proximity to the drain pipe the number was enormous (eff.
17,000 as ajrainst 10 in the former c.ise). It was found that more organisms were
present iu the paillal cavity than in the rectum. In the case of the oysters grown
in water infected with the Bacillus typhosus, it was found that there was no ap-

parent increase of the organisms, but that they could be identified in cultures taken
from the water of the pallial cavity and rectum fourteen days after infection.

     It is found that the typhoid bacillus will not flourish in clean sea water, and
our experiments seem to show so far that it decreases iu numbers in its passage
along the alimentary canal of the oyster. It would seem possible, therefore, that
by methods similar to those employed in the ' Bassins de disgorgement ' of the
French ostreiculturist, where the oysters are carefully subjected to a natural pro-
cess of cleaning, oysters previously contaminated with sewage could be freed of
pathogenic organisms or their products without spoiling the oyster for the

Arrangements are now almost completed for the establishment of an inter-

national bibliographical bureau for zoology. This bureau, the organisation of which

was begun some three years ago, will be located at Ziiricb, Switzerland. It will

publish a series of bibliographical journals, as                           follows:      1, a  fortnightly  bulletin
                                                                                                                                                                   :

'2, an edition of the bulletin printed on thin paper, and only on one side of the

sheet, so that it may be cut up and used for other bibliographical elaboration

and 3, a complete card-catalogue of all zoological literature published after
1895. In addition, the ' Zoologischer Jahre.ibericht ' will be federated with the

undertaking, so as to alFord an annual list of titles, arranged alphabetically by

authors.

In the pamphlet edition the titles will be classified under a series of headings,

corresponding to the systematic groups of animals. The cards will be of the

standard library size, and will be essentially ' authors' cards.' They will, how-

ever, bear a set of simple symbols, which will permit them to be classified in one

of several ditleren: ways, according to the special needs of each individual sub-

scriber, viz. ], alphabetically by authors; 2, systematically by groups of animals;
J, morphologically by organ systems; or 4, faunistically by zoogeographical
regions. The system of symbols is so simple that the cards could be arranged

by any laboratory boy or library assistant, no knowledge of the science being

involved.

All the above classifications will be based upon a study of the text itself; and

incidental observations, though not mentioned in the title, will be brought out
and used as cross-references. Each chapter will then be complete in itself, for it

will contain, as far as possible, all observations published on the subject, whether

published as whole papers, or as accessory notes in a paper, Avhose major part is of

a very different nature. In a word, the unit for the classification will be the

individual observation paragraph, not the paper as a whole.

In various parts of the world the bureau will be aided by, 1, national com-

mittees                                      2,  correspondents ; and  3,  sub-bureaux.  The national committees of
                                          ;

several countries are already organised. They are to use their inOuence in

securing for the bureau such publications as cannot be eonstilted in any library

--to which we have access the Swiss libraries, that of the Zoological Station at

Naples, and those of Leipzig. In case the journals themselves cannot be

oTitained they are to be reported by correspondents. It is, however, so mani-

festly in the interest of each author and of every publishing firm or scientific

society to make its publications known that co-operation is assured. The matter

has already been studied by the French and American committees in considerable
detail, and they have found that it is perfectly possible to obtain the journals in
the way indicated. There is no reason to suppose that England will show her-
                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.      727

   self less ready to co-operate than these two nations. It seems certain that com-
   petent correspondents can be found. Several have indeed already oflered to
   assume this burden. The sub -bureaux are being organised merely in those

   --countries where the language presents exceptional difficulties Bohemia, Hungary,

   Poland and Russia. Tiiey will be maintained at the expense of the particular
   country involved, and are in large measure already realised.

        The financial support of the bureau will come from several sources. The
   initial cost of organising the service will be borne by those who have undertaken

   this task. The current expenses must, however, be in part covered by subsidies
   from learned societies, &c. Thus the Naples Zoological Station has oliered an
   annual o-rant toward the support of the bureau. In Switzerland a considerable
   annual subsidy is also offered to the bureau. In France a subscription has been
   opened under the auspices of the Soci(5te Zoologique de France, aud has been
   subscribed to by several other societies. In the United States a simiLu- course has
   been adopted," and the full sum asked for is already assured. In Russia the
   co-operation takes the form of a national sub-bureau ; I mention it here merely
   because it was there that the first committee was nomin.ated.

        In England the following is needed: 1, a national committee to aid the
   bureau in all such emergencies as require direct local action ; 2, a service of
   correspondents ; and .3, a grant towards the support of the bureau. It is with a

   view to inducing English zoologists to meet these requirements that I take the

   liberty of bringing this matter to the attention of the British Association. It is

   reasonably certain that the enterprise will succeed, if we can only secure one

   half the support that has been secured in the United States or in Switzerland.

   9. Tlie ' Date of Publication ' of Zoological Memoirs.

           By Herbert Haviland Field, Ph.D.

        The accepted rules of zoological nomenolatuve are based upon the so-called
   ' law of priority.' It is tb?rel'oi-e of the greatest importance that what is meant
   by the 'date of publication' should be defined precisely. The rules adopted
   by the international congresses are more explicit on this point than most of the
   previous ones, and the precedent is set for adopting for convenience certain

   arbitrary rulings. Thus, neither the date at which a paper is presented before

   a learned society, nor the date of sending it to press is accepted. On the_ other

   hand, the rule does not specify whether the date of printing or that of issitc is
   to be taken. In certain legal cases (patents. Sec.') the decisioii seems to have
   been the former. This is, however, a date which it is impossible to verify in

   practice, and the latter seems, moreover, the more equitable ruling. I know cases

   in which the difference batween tlie two dates amounts to nearly one year. It is

   therefore important to regulate this point in order to avoid future contestations.

        I should like, then, to make the following propositions to the Committee

   of the Zoological Section :

        (1) That the Committee recommend the date of distribution as the proper

   criterion.

        (2) That the Committee recommend that zoological publications be recorded

   as well as published.

   If the Committee decide to take this step, the new Bibliographical Bureau

   -- --could readily undertake to record and publisli with each paper the date at which

   it was ftent not received aud thus open the way for the ideal solution. This
   would be to make recording the basis of our nomenclature, rather than the mere

   publication. Such a ruling would, however, obviously only be possible after the

   Wepractice had become general.  can to-day do nothing more than work

   towards that solution.

                       10. On Economy of Labour in Zoology.
                          By Thomas R. R. Stebbing, M.A.

     Founding his case upon the presumed admission that the knowledge of natural
history has increased, is increasing, and ought not to be diminished, the author
argues that measures are now urgently required for facilitating the survey of this

extensive and ever-extending body of information. He gives examples of the

onerous conditions of study resulting from the existing state of scientific literature.

He proposes that an effort should be made to gather into a succinct form all the

most indispensable knowledge in each branch of zoology, instead of leaving each

student to gather it as best he may from an unwieldy mass of miscellaneous

writings.

    The proposals now current for a new system of recording in zoology are
cordially endorsed. As the uniformity, simplicity, and completeness aimed at by

those proposals will, if successfully attained, give workers in general a clue through

the maze of future discoveries, it is urged that at this parting of the ways the
opportunity .should be seized for dealing with past acquisitions. They need" to be
presented with the utmost conciseness to which skill and method can reduce
materials so vast and various, and sometimes so vague and so redundant.

    The point is insisted on that, however lowly may be the place in science of

systematic zoology, it is after all a department which must exist. Although the
service indicated is needed for all the other departments, systematic zoology is the

one to which it is most necessary and can most easil_y be rendered. At tlie same

time the undertaking is not of a character to promise an immediate return of
commercial profit. But just as great public works are carried out by Government
at the expense of the nation, so this scientific work appeals to tlie fostering care of
those societies whicli are by their eminence entitled and by their financial position
enabled to act for the commonwealth of ,'^cience.

11. On tlie Septal Organs q/Owema fusiformis. By Professor G. Gilson.

     The object of this communication is to call attention to certain peculiarities
presented by the septa of Owenia fusiformis, and to obtain information from the
anatomists who may have observed similar features in other tubicolous annelids.

     These .septa, witli the exception of the first, or cephalic, and the most remote
ones in the tail, are all perforated. Each of them presents two pores, through
which the adjoining segments communicate.

      These pores are provided with a muscular apparatus, very powerful in certain
of the septa, and sometimes rather complicating their structure.

     The second septum, for instance, which is the most muscular of all, contains, on
each side of the ventral median line, an enormous ovoid mass of muscles, the fibres
of which run in various directions. Through these muscles passes a tiny canal.
This septal canal is very sinuous in its course through the muscular organ, and its
existence is far from being easily recognised, owing to the state of violent contrac-
tion in which the muscles are always ibund in sections. There is no doubt, how-
ever, that the septal canals may open widely enough to allow the eggs to pass and
to reach the fifth segment of the body, which is the only one that communicates
with tlie exterior, through the modified uephridia described in the author's paper

last year at Oxford.
      Besides the canals and their muscles, the fifth septum contains a semicircular

rnuscle which seems to be intended to constrict tlie intestine, which, ju.st where it
pierces tlie septum, becomes suddenly very narrow and acquires a very thick
muscular coat.

      All the septa present .similar structures, more or less complicated, until in the
posterior ones the septal pores are reduced to a short perforation, surrounded by a
thin muscular ring.

     But in the fifth and sixth septa a new feature appears : the muscular, sphincter-
like mass on each side is joined by a tubular ingrowth of the epiderm. This tube
                            --

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.      729

protrudes into the septal tissue until it meets a cavity which communicates with

the septal canal and with the anterior segment.

    Up to the present the author has not heen ahle to detect any aperture at the

extremity of this epidermic tube ; but he is almost certain that such an aperture

really exists, and may open under the action of certain muscular fibres.
    The septal canals, as stated above, are the way through which the eggs

reach the fifth segment ; but the fact that they exist in the second septum, whilst
the segment in front of this has no gonad, shows obviously enough that they must

have another function.
     The author ventures to offer the following e.xplanation as to the function of all

these well-guarded septal pores, and of the epidermic tubes of the fifth and sixth

septa.

    It is a fact easily observed that the worm swells or dilates its body when it
wants to adhere to the sheath in which it lives. And in this way it opposes such

a powerful resistance, that it is quite impossible to pull it out of its tube without

breaking its body in pieces ; and when a part of the body has heen cut off, the
remaining segments do not relax at all, hut remain as turgid and resisting as
before. This shows that the various segments of the body may swell or relax

quite separately.

     The septal organs are the valves which allow the coelomic fluid to flow in or
out when they are open, but impose an insuperable resistance to its exit when the

worm wants to dilate one or two segments separately.

     The paired tubes of the fifth and sixth septa are very likely intended to take in
a small quantity of water from the outside, to be mixed with the coelomic fluid,
when a larger quantity of it happens to be required.

    To sum up, although these researches and experiments are not finished, we have

sufficient reason to consider the curious septal organs of Ozvenia as valves intended
to regulate the pressure in the separate chambers of the perivisceral cavity, and to

eventually divide entirely from one another those which at a given moment the

animal desires to dilate under the contraction of the muscular coat of the skin.

    If this view is correct, we must regard the body of Oicenia as a very elaborate

hydraulic mechanism.

12. On a simple and efficient Collecting Reservoir for the Surface Tow-net.
                                  By W. Garstang.

      13. On the Statistics of Wasps. By Professor F. Y. Edgeworth.

    The number of wasps in a nest may be inferred from the number issuing per
minute : if (I) we know the average time occupied by a wasp in the cycle of
operations between two successive exits, (2) we assume that the whole population

is occupied in keeping up the traffic.
     (1) The author has collected some statistics bearing on the first datum. The

average time occupied by the wasps which he has observed in loading is six

--minutes varying from two minutes, when the load consists of liquid sweets (of

Sir J. Lubbock's observations), to ten minutes, when dried marmalade has to be
hewed. The average interval between the departure of a laden wasp and the

-- --return of the same wasp for another load is with much less variation nine

minutes. Accordingly tlie mean periodic time for a wasp employed in collecting
sweets may be assumed to be about fifteen minutes. This result is verified and
corrected by other methods applicable to all kinds of employment e.(/., stopping the
entrance of a small nest and noting the times of arrivals. The corrected figure is 20.

     If the number of wasps issuing per minute is X, the total number would be
20 X X, if .assumption (2) held. But how inadequate it is is shown from the fact
that the same nest within a short period shows very different rates of traffic.
Thus a nest which at the beginning of a week had a traffic (entrances + exits) of
twenty per minute, had, after three days, a traffic of sixty per minute ; and, after
two more days, a trartic of only twelve per minute, we can at best infer that the
                       --

730 REPORT-- 1895.

maximum observed rate of exit per minute, multiplied by 20, gives a minimum

lower than the total number iu the nest.

In some cases examined by the author the minimum was found to be very

much below the actual number. Thus a nest for which the observed maximum
--average rate of issue was eleven per minute, was found when the whole popula-
-- Ation was killed and counted to have contained, iu round numbers, 600.
                                                                           nest

of which the maximum observed rate of issue was thirty per minute, was found to

have contained 1,600.

     1. On Insect Transformations. By Professor L. C. Miall, F.R.S.

     2. On Mounting Marine Animals as Transparent Lantern Slides.
                            By H. C. SoRBY, LL.D., F.R.S.

     For some years past the author has devoted much time to this subject, when
on board the yacht Glimpse. The methods which give good results vary much in
the case of diii'erent animals. Some must be arranged on the glass and dried

quickly soon after having been caught, whereas others ^like Meduste) must be
treated over and over agaiu with moderately strong alcohol to dissolve out all the
salts. In some cases various staining materials must be used to briug out the
structure, and some should be decalcified.

     Usually the animal.« are killed by keeping them for a short time in diluted
alcohol, and are then arranged on the glass ; and, after as much of the alcohol as
will drain out is lost, they are dried in a current of air. The edges dry first, and
so adhere to the glass that, on further drying, the animals become thin without
any material change in form. In some cases they must be thoroughly soaked with

clear gum before becoming quite dry. Finally, when quite dry, they are mounted

in Canada balsam, and the edges of the cover glass very completely bound round
so as to prevent the balsam running out when heated in the lantern.

3. Descri])tion of Methods for Collecting and Estimating the number of

       Small Aniinals in Sea Water. By H. C. Soeby, LL.D., F.R.S.

     The author described the methods he employs to collect moderately small
animals by means of a brown holland bag, at the bottom of which is an arrange-
ment so that brass wire sieves with meshes of various sizes can be fixed by a sort
of bayonet joint. Through these the water flows readily, and the animals are

easily waslied off into a small bulk of water.
     Another method is to collect water in a special bottle at various depths from

the surface to bottom, and to pour 2-k gallons through a sieve having openings

about ^^-ij of an inch in diameter From this the animals are washed off into a
few ounces of water. The numbers of the various kinds are afterwards counted in

a small deep narrow trough filled over and over agaiu until the whole quantity
has been examined. The number oi each kind per gallon can then be easily

calculated.

4. On the Conditions affecting Bacterial Life in River Water.
                 By E. Frankland, JD.C.L., F.E.S.

lu a series of monthly observations, the author found that the microbes in the

water of the Thames and Lea are, as a rule, much more numerous in winter than

in summer. Tliere are three conditions, to any one of which this difterence might

be attributed, namely, temperature, sunshine, and rainfall. By a series of graphic

representations these thi'ee conditions are disentangled from each other by placing

the results of the microbe determinations in juxtaposition with (1) the temperature

of the water at the time  the samples were taken                                                                                                             (2)  the number of hours of sun-
                                                                                                                                                          ;

shine on the day and up to the hour when the sample was drawn, and on the two

preceding days ; and (3) the flow of the Thames over Teddington Weir on the
same day expressed in millions of gallons per twenty-four hours. Altbough the

graphic representations were confined to the Thames, the conditions affecting bac-

terial life in this river are doubtless equally potent in other rivers and streams.

These graphic representations afford definite evidence as to which of the thi'ee

conditions just named has the predominant influence upon bacterial life in river

water. They show that whilst coincidences between a high number of microbes

and a low temperature and absence of sunshine are not wanting, some other condi-

tion entirely masks tl;e effect, if any, of temperature and sunshine. This condition

is the amount of rainfall higher up the river, or, in other words, the volume of

water flowing along the river-bed.

The interesting observations of Dr. Marshall Ward leave no doubt that sun-

light is a powerful germicide ; but it is obvious that its potency in this respect

must be greatly diminished, if not entirely annulled, when the solar rays have

passed through a stratum of water of even comparatively small thickness before

tliey reach the living organisms                                                                                                                       and the author shows, by a series of experiments
                                                                                                                                                    ;

upon the efl'ect of sunlight upon the river water at various depths from the surface,

that the germicidal effect of sunlight on Thames microbes is nil at depths of one

foot and upwards from the surface of the water, even when the river is in a com-

paratively clear condition. It cannot, therefore, excite surprise that the efl'ect of

sunshine upon bacterial life in the great mass of Thames water should be nearly,

if not quite, imperceptible.

The author also calls attention to the powerful effect of storage reservoirs in

the diminution of the number of microbes in river water, and to the very important

bearing which this fact has upon the storage of flood water in the Thames Valley,

for it leaves no doubt that storage for a month or two of the flood waters would

efl'ect such a bacterial improvement as would render the water of good quality

for domestic use. By the construction of such storage works, the capacity of

the Thames basin for the supply of good potable water to London would be enor-

mously increased.

     Since the publication of bis papers on Lecanium viride and C/nonaspis biclacis,
the author has devoted three years to continuous work upon the (Joccidse of Ceylon.

He has recorded 150 species, of which fully two-thirds were new, and found it

necessary to create two or three new genera for the rece])tion of strikingly aberrant

forms. He referred to newly discovered organs in the encapsulated male, and

remarked that he had in preparation a monograph, to be illustrated by 120 or more

plates, giving figures of adults and larv;e drawn i'rom life. On his return to

Ceylon he contemplates continuing the investigation in both its scieutiBc and
economic aspects.

8. Observations on the Marine Fauna of Hotitman's Ahrolhos Islands,

          Western Australia. By W. Saville-Kent, F.L.S., F.Z.S.

     Mr. Saville-Kent's investigations of tlie marine fauna of Houtman's Abrolhos
Islands were associated with a visit he paid tbeiu in his capacity of Commissioner
of Fisheries to the Western Australian Government, and were conducted with the
particular object of advising that Government as to the conditions and prospects
the adjacent waters presented for the establishment therein of profitable oyster

or mother-of-pearl shell fisheries.

     Houtman's Rocks, or Houtman's Abrolhos, as they are variously charted, are
so named alter one of the early Dutch explorers in contradistinction to a coral
group, also known as the Abrolhos, lying off the coast of Brazil. The island
group discussed in this paper is a small archipelago, chiefly of coral origin,
situated between the latitudes of 29° and 30° S., about thirty miles west of Cham-

pion Bay and the important Western Australian port of Geraldton.
     As a result of his investigations Mr. Saville-Kent found that the ordinary

Australian rock oyster, OstrcBa glomerata, occurred there in tolerable abundance and
under conditions that would justify its being made the subject of systematic cultiva-
tion. The smaller West Australian variety mother-of-pearl shell allied to or identical
with Meleagrina ijnbricnta occurs very sparingly on the Abrolhos Reefs, but in the
Commissioner of Fisheries' opinion was not worthy of serious attention in face of
the unexpectedly favourable conditions he discovered to obtain there for the
introduction and acclimatisation of the larger and more valuable species, Meleagrina
margaritifera. This decision was arrived at as the outcome of an investigation of
the associated marine fauna, and which was found to present features of high
interest from both a utilitarian and a biological standpoint.

     The existing pearl and mother-of-pearl shell fisheries of Western Australia, as
associated with the larger species, have not hitherto extended further south than
Exmouth Gulf, in about lat. 22° S., and are consequently limited to the Tropics.
The fishery for the smaller species, Meleagrina hnbricatn, is confined chiefly to
Shark's Bay, three to four degrees south of Exmouth Gulf, and has in consequence
of the wasteful depletion of the banks in former years been reduced to a compara-

tively low state of productiveness. Among other operations initiated by Mr.

Saville-Kent, with the object of resuscitating the Shark's Bay fishery, has been the
experimental transportation to it and cultivation of the large tropical pearl shell
Meleagrina margaritifera. These acclimatisation experiments, althougli initiated
only on a small scale, have been attended with complete success. The large
mother-of-pearl shell has not only shown its capability of thriving in the colder
waters of Shark's Bay, but has within a year of its transportation to this exLra-
tropieal area commenced to freely propagate.

     The site selected for the foregoing experiments in Shark's Bay was the neigh-

bourhood of extensive banks of coral growths pertaining to the genus Turbinaria.
and from which reefs Mr. Saville-Kent obtained the remarkably large specimens of

this Madrepore that are now on view in the e.xhibition galleries of the Natural
History Museum, South Kensington. It has been determined by Mr. Saville-Kent

in the course of his Australian explorations that the genus Turbinaria represents
the group of Madrepores which in Australian waters enters most extensively into
the composition of coral reefs in the colder or extra-tropical limit of their distribu-
tion. This predominance of Turbinarians had been found by him to obtain at

Wide Bay, on the southern outskirts of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland; in

the colder though more northern waters at the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria;
and, finally, in the Shark's Bay district of Western Australia.

     The conditions which permitted the successful acclimatisation of Meleagrina
margaritifera in Shark's Bay were found by Mr. Saville-Kent to be still more
favourably fulfilled around Houtman's Abrolhos. In and among this island group,

notwithstanding; tlie fact that it lay some two degrees south of Shark's Bay, the
character and composition of the coral reefs proved to be entirely distinct. In
place of the extra-tropical Turbinarife the corals of the Abrolhos Reefs comprise,
as in essentially tropical districts, numerous varieties of branching Madreporae,
or so-called Stag's-horn corals, commingled with many species of Porites, Monti-
pora, Pocillopora, Seriatopora, Coeloria, Mussa, and other intra-tropical reef-build-

ing species.

   A yet more remarkable phenomenon, however, is recorded by Mr. Saville-Kent

in connection with the marine fauna of Houtman's Abrolhos. This is the circum-
stance that he discovered on its reefs three of the most valuable economic species
of Holothuridre or Beche-de-mer, identical with types that are systematically
collected in Torres Straits, and throughout the northern moiety of the Queensland
Great Barrier Reef, but which are unknown to the coastal reefs of Western

Australia further north, and where their place is taken by a distinct and much less

valuable commercial species.

     The fish fauna of Houtman's Abrolhos, while corresponding to a large extent
with that of the temperate Australian seaboard, as instanced by such genera as
Pagrus, Aulopus, and Seriola, is also associated with many essentially tropical

species, including, notably, a large assemblage of brilliantly coloured Labridae, or
Parrot-fishes. Certain of these Labridre, while not obtained by Mr. Saville-Kent

in collections made among the mainland reefs of Western Australia, were familiar
to him, as in the case of the Holotlinridre, as denizens of Torres Straits and the

northern region of the Great Barrier Reef.

     The anomalous character of the marine fauna of Houtman's Abrolhos as
herein deBned can only be accounted for by the assumption that an ocean
current setting in from the equatorial area of the Indian Ocean penetrates as far
south as this island group, and has borne with it the floating embryos of the

AHolothuvidfe and Ccelenterates, &c., that so characteristically distinguish it.

reference to the Admiralty charts, dealing with the ocean currents of this region,

 supports this interpretation to a considerable extent ; indicating, as a matter of

 fact, a prevailing northerly set along the western coast of Australia, but at the
same time a distinct southerly intrusion of the waters of th? Indian Ocean at some

distance off shore down towards and closely approaching Houtman's Abrolhos.
 In further support of this interpretation Mr. Saville-Kent also determined by

 synchronous readings of the thei-mometer at the coldest season of the year, July,
 that as great a diiference as from ten to fourteen degrees Fahrenheit distinguished

 the surface temperature of the sea at respectively the Abrolhos Islands and in

 Champion Bay. Mr. Saville-Kent remarks, in conclusion, that much scope is yet

 left for further investigation in this direction ; while with respect to the anomalous
 character of the marine fauna it would be greatly to the advantage of marine

 biological science if a thoroughly exhaustive investigation thereof could be

 carried out.

(swimming, di^dug, running, flying), in feeding, bathing, &c., are instinctive or

congenital in their definiteness ; and hnw far the definiteness of these and other
activities is a matter of individual acquisition. Observations were also made on
congenital and acquired timidity. While the perforuiance of these activities has a

congenital basis they are perfected by individual acquisition. There is no instinc-
tive and congenitalavoidance of insects with warning colours ; that appears to be
entirely the result of individual experience. There seems to be little or nothing in
the observations to afford any material support to the view that the instinctive
activities result from the inheritance of what is individually acquired.

3. On some questions relating to the Morphology and Distribution
                     of Medusa'. By Dr. Otto Maas.

    Dr. Otto Maas exhibited some plates from his monograph of the 'Albatross
Medusffi. and discussed some questions arising from the study of these Pacific forms.

     The collection, though not very rich, is of interest in various points :

1. Morphological.  2. Zoogeographical.  3. Bionomical.

    L Amongst 18 species 9 are new, several of them peculiar forms, for

Instance, a representative of the aberrant genus Homotoneme, established 1892 for

some forms of the ' Plankton ' Expedition. Amongst the Acraspeda we find the

wenera Feriphylla, Atolla, and others which are of importance for the morphology
of the whole group, and which have induced Clans and Vanlioffeu to a reformation
of Hiickd's system. The previous authors could not study the genital and sense

organs ; a detailed study of these shows that we can trace a line of relationship

from the primitive Lucernaridoe through forms like PeriphyUa and Naiiphanta to
the higher Discophora, forms like Atolla lying a little to the side of the line, whilst

Charybdea is totally away from it. The study of the canal system of the Peri-
phyllidse and their relations shows some primitive features in correspondence with

the embryology of the higher forms, i.e., the interruption of the continuous ento-
dermic cavity at four interradial points by the invagination of the ' Trichterhohlen.'

     2. The Medusae have been caught in an oceanic basin hitherto scarcely ex-
plored. In a map of the distribution of the Cathammata given by Vanholfen the
part of the Pacific navigated by the ' Albatross ' is an empty gap which is now

tilled up.

     The list of Acraspeda species shows a striking resemblance to that of the
' Challenger ' Expedition. The so-called ' deep sea Medusas ' seem to have a very

wide g-eographical distribution ; thej'have been brought home by the 'Challenger,'
the ' Vettor Pisani,' the * National,' and the ' Albatrosp,' but it is to be noticed

that they have been caught only in those really oceanic exphn-ations, so, if they are,

not deep-sea Medusje, they are certainly not forms of the shiillow water.

    Amongst the Polypomedusje we iind a -very close relatioi'sbip between Atlantic
and Pacific species. The different species of one genus are in general much more
difficult to distinguish than amongst the Trachomedusse. This perhaps may be

explained by the eflective power of passive dispersal.
     3. For the first time a great number of sketches of living material of the

Periphyllidfe, &c., had been obtained on board. All these show the dark purple
colour, generally attributed to deep sea animals. The explanation for other forms

is, that in the green phosphorescent light of the abysses, purple is the comple-
mentary colour, which makes the animal invisible, and acts as a protective colour.
It would be dangerous to conclude from this that Periphylla, &c., are deep-sea
forms. They have been brought up in an open trawl from a great depth, but the
closed part of the net contained no Medusae. If a haul from a great depth con-
tains forms which did not occur in surface hauls, these forms do not necessarily

come from the abyss, for they might have been caught on the way to the sur-
face. Our knowledge of the pelagic life of the surface is still so incomj^lete
that every expedition brings us new species, as has been shown in the Copepoda,

MedusEB, and other groups of the 'Albatross ' Expedition.

         4. On the Sjoermatogenesis in Birds. By J. E. S. Mooee.

     The observations were made to ascertain whether the course of the spermatogenesis
in birds was essentially similar to that of other vertebrates recently examined.
It was found that in two points of chief importance, namely, the manner of nu-
merical reduction of the chromosomes and the alternation of the homo- and hetero-

type divisions, the spermatogenesis of birds is closely similar to that of the remaining
vertebrate forms.

     During the first heterotype division, which corresponds to the division of the
growing cells in Mammals and of the great spermatocytes in Elasmobranchs and
Amphibia, the spermatic elements of pigeons show a marked tendency towards
the formation of multinucleate masses. One of the most interesting features apper-
taining to these bodies is that the spindle-figure during the division of their nuclei
appears to originate entirely within the nucleus, since the nuclear wall can be
distinctly seen after the spindle-figure has been fully formed. The stages in the

division may be diagrammatically represented thus :

Multinucleate Spermatocyte of Pigeon,

(a) Nucleus in synaptic phase.  (6 and c) SpintUe-figurcs.  (im) Nuclear waU.

     The advent of the great heterotype mitosis is always preceded during the
spermatogenesis by the peculiar convoluted and lop-sided figure {a> which is
                                           --

here, as elsewhere, characteristic of what I have previously termed the ' synaptic

phase.'

     The whole course of the spermatogenesis appears to correspond more closely
with that of Elasmobranchs than of Mammals, since there appear to be two
generations and one division after the synapsis before the spermatozoa are

complete.

     As in Elasmobranchs and Mammals, the number of the chromosomes appears to

be reduced during the synapsis, and to be then determined for succeeding divi-

sions, just as in the case of plants.

    The spermatogenesis of birds supports in every way the conclusion first put

forward by 8trasaburger, which is at present gaining ground, namely, that the
process of numerical reduction in the chromosomes is not brought about by any
division at all, and is similar for both animals and plants.

           5. On the Development of the Teeth in Certain Inseetirora.
       By M. F. Woodward, Demonstrator of Zoology, R.C.Sci. Lond.

      In the hedgehog the author describes vestigial calcified milk predecessors to
the third upper incisor, the lower canine, and the first pre-molar of both upper
and lower jaws, and an uncalcified vestige of the milk predecessor of the second
lower incisor, thus extending Leche's observations and confirming his later con-
clusion that the adult incisors, canines, and pre-molars all belong to the third or
replacing tooth series. In addition, a vestigial anterior lower incisor and a third
lower pre-molar were observed. Indications of three dentitions are described for
the molar series, the molars being referred to the third or replacing dentition.

     The teeth of Gymnura, Sore.r, Talpa, Centetes, and JEricultis are also dealt
with, and the following points more especially noted :

     1. The presence in Gytmiura of five pre-molara in both upper and lower jaws,

represented in both dentitions.
      2. Tlie absence of the alleged milk predecessor to the tirst pre-molar of Talpa

described by Spence Bate, that tooth being shown to be itself a milk tooth.
     3. The development, in all cases, of the successor to the fourth pre-molar

between the ' deciduous pre-molars 3 and 4.' The facts associated with this
appear to indicate that the so-called ' deciduous pre-molar 4 ' is a precociously
developed molar, and that the tooth which replaces it is a much retarded pre-
molar of the milk series.

    Two sets of calcified teeth are shown to be for the greater part developed

among Insectivores, and it is characteristic of them that there is a tendency

towards reduction of the milk set with early development of the replacing denti-

tion,

6. On the Mammalian Hyoid} By Professor G. B. Howes.

The author proved from the study of Nasua that the small bone attached to

the paroccipital process in Lepus and Trocaria {Hyrax), independently described

by Krause and Brandt, is in reality the styloid, and showed that the discovery

enables us to recognise two distinct culminating types of modification of the hyoid

of mammals, viz. (i.), the protero-stylic, known only in man and the marmosets,

and (ii.) the opistho-stylic, known only in the rodents mentioned. Reviewing the

subject more generally, he called attention to the presence of a considerable tym-

pano-hyal, occupying a novel position, in Choloapus, and he exhibited the hyoid

of a young rabbit, the body of which was subdivided by a transverse suture,

probably indicative of the original demarcation-line between its two component

A* copulae.'  classification of the types of mammalian hyoid was submitted.

                  7. On the Poison Apparatus of Certain Snakes.
                        By G. S. West, A.R.C.Sci. Lond.

     The author describes, in thirteen genera of Opisthoglypha, a gland, which, there
is every reason to believe, is homologous with the poison glaud of the Viperine
and Proteroglyphous types. The course of the poison duct and its detailed
relationships to the teeth are dealt with, the latter being established through the
mediation of a cavity enclosed within muscular folds, and so effected that loss of

the tooth does not in any way result in iojury to the duct. The distal portion of
the duct is shown to be secretory and mucus-forming.

     In the marine snakes (Hydrophiinre) the poison gland is shown to be more or
less free from the supra-labial, and to consist of longitudinally disposed tubules
converging anteriorly towards a central duct. The latter is shown to become
enlarged anteriorly, enclosing a cavity in front of the bases of the grooved teeth
having muscular walls and specialised for purpose of communication with the

grooves.

     Certain vascular folds of the buccal mucous membrane are described, which
occupy the interstices between the teeth, and are probably analogous to the
villous processes occurring in the mouths of certain soft-shelled Chelonians.

8. On the Value of Myology as an Aid in the Classification of Animals.
    By F. G. Parsons, F.R.C.S., Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at

     St. Thomas's Hospital.

     The paper contains a short notice of the reasons which induce Systematists to
place little reliance on the study of muscles. It then reviews some of the muscles
in the great order of Rodents, and points out how closely they correspond in
animals which are nearly related, and how little the different modes of life of their
possessors aft'ect them. The ease with which different sub-orders and families of
Rodents can be distinguished by a study of their muscles is next noticed, and
finally the test of myology is applied to the family of Dipodidae, the position of
which is still unsettled.

--Pkesident of the Section II. J. Mackinder, M.A., F.R.G.S.

            THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12.

The President delivered the following Address :

WeThis is a memorable year for English students of geography.  have enter-

tained in London for the first time a great gathering of our foreign colleagues, and

have presented to the British public the unfamiliar spectacle of a geographical

meeting, in which scholars and professors were as prominent as explorers. As a
nation we may justly claim that for several generations we have been fore-
most in the work of the pioneer ; nor need we view with dissatisfaction our contri-

butions to precise survey, to hydrography, to climatology, and to biogeographj-.

It is rather on the synthetic and philosopbical, and therefoi'e on the educational,

side of our subject that we fall so markedly below the foreign and especially the
German standard, and it is for this reason that we may regard the Sixth Inter-

national Congress as a noteworthy object lesson for English geographers and

teachers. The time seems, moreover, to have been ripe for some such stimulating

influence. To indicate a few signs only of rising courage among our geographers,

and of sympathy on the part ot the public, I would draw your attention to the

Rowinstitution of afternoon meetings in Savile  for the discussion of technical

questions, to the success of the new Geographical Journal, notwithstanding its

geographical as opposed to merely ' adventuring ' flavour, to the recent formation

of a geographical association of Public Schoolmasters, and to the demand for

addresses on the teaching of geography on the part of the local branches of the

Teachers" Guild. Facts are reminding us once more that the lapse of a certain

time is essential to the rooting of a new idea, and we may thank the geographical

veterans of 1869 for sowing seed the fruit of which we are now harvesting. That

I am not alone in ray interpretation of present tendencies is clear from the

emphatic opinion of the President of the Royal Geographical Society expressed

in his last annual address, that 'the time is approaching for a reconsideration

of the educational policy of the Society.' It would almost seem that we are

nearmg a development of geographical education not unhke that which nine years

ago followed on the publication of Mr. Keltic's valuable Report. At that time

two of my predecessors in this chair, Sir Frederick Goldsmid and Sir Charles

Warren, thought it not unfit to make education the chief theme of their addresses,

and encouraged by their example I venture, under present circumstances, to call

your attention once more to that subject. Since 1886 and 1887, however, much

has happened, and we no longer need to discuss the more elementary teaching

of geography. I propose, therefore, to treat of comparative and philosophical

geography in relation especially to secondary and university education, and it

seems to me that an historical rather than an a priori discussion gives best promise

of result.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  739

     The middle of the 18th century marks an important epoch in the history of
geography. In ancient times Ptolemy and Strabo grasped the system and
possibilities of our science, but they failed to build high from lack of a broad
foundation of precisely recorded facts. Subsequently, geography had its Dark

Ages and its Renascence in harmony with the general trend of human affairs. By

the end of the 16th century Mercator and Ortelius had somewhat more than
recovered the Greek position, but still, for another century and a half, geographers
wrestled with essentially the same problems as had presented themselves to the
ancients. The observers ascertained latitudes and longitudes with ever-increasing

precision, the cartographers projected the observed positions on their maps with,
growing happiness of compromise, and the scholars sought, with the prodigious
industry characteristic of the age, to identify the sites mentioned by the ancient

-- --authorities. Three names Harrison, D'Anville, and Vareuiiis in the several

fields of observation, cartography, and scholarship, may be taken as completing
this stage of development, although, as is always the case, the new and the old
overlapped. In 1761 the chronometer was added by Harrison to the magnetic

compass, the log-line, the sextant, and the theodolite, and thus was completed the
observer's equipment. In the same year D'Anville published his Atlas Modernp,
in which (besides a fidelity of outline greater than that of his predecessors Delisle
and Homann) he brought to bear a mechanical tinish and a criticism of data that
were new to cartography. Only a few years earlier, in 1755, there appeared in
Paris a French translation of the Geographia Generalis of Varenius, first published
at Amsterdam in 1650, edited for Cambridge in 1681 by Sir Isaac Newton, and
reprinted again and again for three generations as the masterpiece of the ' scholarly
geographers. Thus when George III. was still young, the Jwrizojital outlines of

the map of the world had taken their now familiar form, and school geography

consisted of ' the use of the globes ' with some small attention to classical topo-

graphy.

     What made the 18th century a transition age of such importance to geography
was the realisation of new problems, which both Antiquity and the Renascence had

either neglected or utterly failed to solve. These problems allow of most general
expression by the use of three convenient terms, two of them lately imported from

-- --Germany lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere the first implying the rock

globe whose surface is both land and sea-bed, the other two denoting the external
envelopes. The geographer is concerned with the atmosphere, the hydrosphere
and the surface of the lithospbere. His first business is to define the form, or relief,
of the surface of the solid sphere, and the movements, or circulation, within the two
fuid spheres. The land-relief conditions the circulation, and this in turn gradually
changes the land-relief. The circulation modifies climates, and these, together
with the relief, constitute the environments of plants, animals, and men, Shorn of
complexities, this is the main line of the geographical argument. In the language

of Richthofen, the earth's surface and man are the terminal links. It is clear

--that all depends on the accuracy of the first premises the form of the lithosphere

and the movements within the hydrosphere and atmosphere. Before last century

geographers ascertained the horizontal elements in form, but neglected the vertical.

In the matter of outline, the maps of D'Anville are an immense improvement on
those of Ortelius, but they exhibit essentially the same almost child-like methods for
the depiction of relief which had been employed by Buckinck in the 1478 edition
of Ptolemy. Until this was remedied the whole superstructure of comparative
and philosophical geography lacked any real basis.

     Like the letters of the alphabet, conventional hill-shading was evolved from
pictures rather than invented. The great atlas of Germany, published at Nurem-
berg in 1753 by the successors of Homann, consisting as it does of maps engraved
in various years extending from 1718 to 1753, shows admirably almost every stage

in the evolution. Other striking evidence may be seen in the chart of New

Zealand drawn from Captain Cook's surveys, and reproduced by Admiral Wharton
in his edition of Cook's Journal. Side by side on the same chart, we have
the ' ant-hills' of Buckinck and Ortelius, and the ' caterpillars ' of modern maps; but

the latter, like degenerate animals with rudimentary organs, still retain clear marks

                                                                                3B2

of their origin. The ' ant-hills,' elsewhere sown evenly over the land-surface, ar3
in certain parts drawn into chains and foreshortened, or in modern railway parlance

' telescoped.' One step more--the confusion of the lines of slope-shading with those

of hill-outline-- and the pictures would he conventionalised, all signs of origin
would he lost, and students who had never seen a great mountain-range would be
led to think of it as a wall-like ridge. Even ' ant-hills ' are preferable to the

' caterpillar' in its crudest form.

    An indication of the importance attached to the new problem of relief is to be

seen in the fact that, before the metliod of hill-shading or hatching had been perfected,

the method of horizontal contouring had already been invented. In 17;:i7 Philip
Buache, a French geographer of remarkably original mind, produced a contoured
chart of the English Cbannel. Contour lines represent what would be coast lines
were the sea to rise or fall to the level indicated, and it was natural that this device
should first be applied to the mapping of the sea-bed rather than the land. In
1791 Diipain Triel drew a contoured map of France. But already in 1783, as Mr.
Ilavenstein pointed out in his address at the Carditi' meeting, Lehmann had com-
bined the two systems, and, by superimposing hachures upon contours, and making
the depth of shading proportional to the closeness of the contours, had produced
a map which, while yielding to the popular requirements, rested on a scientific
basis. Contoured maps, in which names are few or absent, can now, however, be
made to rival in pictorial suggestiveness those which are shaded, and such maps
are the more valuable in that they are not only structurally correct, but that they
can be read also with accuracy and ease. Some of the sheets (if the American

Geoo-raphical Survey may be cited as e.vcelleut examples of graphic effect produced

by contours only.

     Ptolemy's knowledge of the theory and methods of cartography far outran the

positive materials at his command for the mapping of the known world. In the

same way the methods of depicting relief, though so recently developed, already at

the end of last century more than sufficed for the presentment of the recorded data.

As was seen in the case of Ptolemy, there are peculiar dangers in the possession of

an engine more powerful than is needed for the work in hand. In 1788 Frnace

was the only country in the world with a completed map based on systematic and
Adetailed surveys.
                    relief-map like that of Dupain Triel was possible only in

such a country. But in 175G Philip Buache had already launched a general theory

of relief resting on the conception of river basins, and had enriched geography

with the terms ' water-parting ' and ' plateau.' In the absence of positive know-

ledge, what more natural than that cartographers should make illegitimate use

of the theory of Buache, and should assume that in the coherent system of water-

partings they had the orographical skeleton of the world ? Having drawn the

courses of the rivers, they had only to run caterpillar-shading along the water-

partings to produce a map, in parts accidentally true, which represented the land

as uniformly composed of a series of flat pans. Such a method of map-drawing

was advocated by Friedrich Schultz, in a paper published at Weimar as late as

1803, and is not rare in popular maps of much later date.

It is to Ale.'cander von Humboldt that we owe the method still in use for giving

a general, yet real, idea of the relief of a little known country. Following, as he

himself tells us, the precedent of the canal engineers, he constructed vertical sec-

tions along his routes through Spain and Mexico. It is worth noting in this

--connection that our knowledge of the relief of the sea-bed is mainly due to the

requirements of another set of engineers those engaged in laying telegraphic

cables. Humboldt's sections were rendered possible by the daily use of the baro-

meter and chronometer, and by Ramond's improvement of the formula for the

reduction of barometric data. Before Humboldt, the barometer had been used

for the determination of isolated heights, but not for the traversing of a whole

country.

point to no such crucial utterance in the i-ister field of oceanography, tliough it is

said that, about the time of the American lievolutiou, Benjamin Franklin suggested

that wind-pressure was the cause of the surface-currents of the sea. His idea was

contained in a memoir on the Gulf Stream, which was suppressed by him lest it

should fall into the hands of the English, and be of use to tlieir ships in crossing

the Atlantic. Major Rennell also, who, by his map of India and his Herodoteau

identifications, presents a likeness to the bfst of the old school of geographers,

showed his participation in the new by compiling an Atlantic current-chart. But

Humboldt's invention of isotherms in 1817 first gave to climatology cartographic

resources, and rendered easy and precise the correlation of climate with relief.

of atmospheric pressure, of the temperature of the sea-s.' face, of density of

population, and indeed to any similar marses of data, capaLiC, so far as time is

concerned, of reduction to averages, but varying locally. The last edition of

Berghaus's Physical Atlas is, in this matter, a monument to the memory of

Humboldt; j-et it is strange that a method first suggested, in the seventeenth

century, by the magnetic lines of the Englishman Flalley, should have been left to
fructify in tlie mind of a German of the nineteenth century-

The facts of geography are obviously capable of two kinds of treatment. The

chapter-headings may be such as ' Rivers,' ' Mountains,' ' Cities,' or such as
·' Ireland,' ' Italy,' ' Australia.' In other words, we may consider the phenomena

of a given type in all parts of the globe, or we may discuss in a given part of the

globe the phenomena of all types. In the former case, our book should as a whole

observe the order of what has been called the geographical argument ; in the

latter case each chapter, the discussion of each country, should exhibit that order

comjjlete. For historical reasons, which will be referred to later, we English have

fallen into a bad habit of describing the former treatment as ' physical geography,'

and the latter as 'geography.' The Germans are more reasonable when they con-

trast AUfjemeine Erdkimde with Landerkunde, but Chorography, our nearest English

equivalent to Liinderlumde, is a clumsy expression. An alternative would be to

speak of ' special geography,' thereby implying a correlative to ' general geography,'

which is a })reci»e rendering of Allyemeine Erdkunde. By whatever name we call it,

however, it is clear that the treatment by regions is a more thorough test of the

logic of the geographical argument than is the treatment by types of phenomena.

Hence Humboldt's Essai politique sur la Nouvelle-Espctfjne, published in 1809,

must take high rank among' the efforts of the new geography as the first complete

descriptioQ of a laiid with the aid of the modern methods. Here, for the first time,
we have an exhaustive attempt to relate causally relief, climate, vegetation, fauna,

and the various human activities.

The services of Humboldt to our science were so great that he almost merits

the title of a new founder, and yet, of late, it has been the custom to decry him.

It is probable that his memory has suffered a little from the less original work of
his old ago, for the Humboldt who devised cross-sections and isotherms, and wrote

the Essai politique, was divided by the distance of a whole generation from him

who was responsible for the Adeyi and the Kosmos.

   We come now to the central event in the history of modern geography. It

was in 1 he year 18:10 that Karl Ritter was called to Berlin to act in the double

capacity of Professor in the Military School and Professor Extraordinary in the

University. Born in 1779, ten years after Humboldt, Ritter's early training

and circumstances were such as admirably to fit him for the great position

he was to occupy during the last thirty-nine years of his life. Ilis schooling

was at Schnepfenthal, under Salzmann, a well-known educational experimenter

of the following of Rousseau. Later in life Ritter learnt to know and to love the

classics, but Salzmaun's hostility to them as an educational implement secured for

his pupil freedom from the current intellectual moulding. The peculiar opportuni-

ties of his subsequent position as tutor in the Hollweg family almost amounted to
--742 REPORT 1895.

an endowment for research, and it was then that he accumulated that vast miscel-
laneous Imowledge so valuable to the intellectual pioneer. It is not unimportant in
connection with Eitter's later theories to observe that, at this time, Cuvier and Franz
Bopp were applying the comparative method to anatomy and philology. Nor did

he fail to cultivate that hah-artistic perception of land-forms, the early exercise

of which seems to be to the geographer what youthful training in pronunciation is
to the linguist. While travelling with the young Hollwegs, he caused astonish-

ment in Switzerland by the accuracy of his delineation of a mountain range. Add
that fortuue brought Humboldt and Pestalozzl across his path, and we understand

the influences which shaped Karl Ritter into the greatest modern professor of geo-
graphy.

    Ritter produced both books and men. He had the personal charm of the born

teacher, and the Prussian officers of 186(5 and 1870 were as truly his intellectual
offspring as was the Erdkunde, of which Schlegel said that it was the Bible of
Geography. Nor did his classes fail to bring ibrth professed geographers, such as
Guthe, and historians with the geographical eye, such as Curtius. But Ritter did

not stand alone. Pie was one of a group of four men, who together made the
geography of the nineteenth century as distinctively a German science as that of
the eighteenth century had been French. One is almost tempted to draw a com-
parison, man for man, between Humboldt, Ritter, Bergliaus, and Perthes, and tbat

--great group of later Germans Bismarck. Moltke, von Roon, and AVilliam I. The

coincidence is not quite so fortuitous as might at first sight appear; for Berghaus,
the cartographer, and Perthes, the capitalist employer of cartographers, were as
necessary to the earlier combination as, to the later, were von Roon, the organiser,
and William, the kingly employer of statesmen and generals.

     In 1827 Humboldt, who, on his mother's side, was French by descent, left Paris,
which had been his home for nearly twenty years, to join the Prussian Court at
Berlin. In the winter of 1827-28 he gave a course of brilliant lectures before the
University, in which was contained the nucleus of the subsequent Kosmos. In 1829,
at the invitation of the Russian Government, he spent twenty-five weeks on a rapid
journey to the mines of the Ural and Altai, and received the impressions which
led to the Asien. TLieuce onward Humboldt and Ritter lived at Berlin, mutually
appreciative, and complementing each other in mental characteristics. They died
in the same year, 18.59, just before those great political events which changed the
whole aspect of German life.

     The influence of the new school was early felt beyond Germany. Petermann,
the pupil of Berghaus, came to our islands to help Keith Johnston with the

English edition of Berghaus's great Physical Atlas, whilst Arnold Guyot, the Swiss

disciple of Ritter, after teaching for a time at Neuchatel, crossed the Atlantic to
lecture at Harvard, and afterwards to accept a chair at Princeton.

    No sooner, however, were the two great masters at Berlin dead, than German
geography passed into a new phase, a phase of wliicli the ty|iical representative was

Oscar Peschel, tlie critic of both Humboldt and Ritter. The facts of Peschel's life

are soon told. He began as a journalist, he became a geographical writer, and
died a professor of geography. From 1849 to 1854 he was assistant editor of the

Augsburg Allffemeine Zeitting. Then until 1870 he was solo editor of the weekly
Ausland. From 1871 until his death in 1875 he occupied a chair in Leipzig
University. The titles of his books may serve as an index to his mind. The
* Age of the Discoveries' appeared in 1858, and the 'History of Geography '

in 1865. Be then turned his attention to physical questions, and produced in 1870
his striking ' New Problems for Comparative Geography.' Finally, in 1874, came

the Volkei-lamde, a title not easily translatable into English. After his death

his pupils, acting apparently under the inspiration of Professor Kirchhoff' of Halle,
collected his essays and lectures, which were published in a series of volumes edited
with varying degrees of merit.

     Peschel's criticism of Humboldt was of the rarest kind. He appreciated the

good, detected the errors, and, above all, suggested the remedies. Humboldt's
later works, the Asien and the Kosmos, both exhibit striking excellences, and
for a time enjoyed great vogue, yet both, like Newton's Optics, helped to delay the

Howadvauce of science.  this happened will he manifest if we reflect that general

or physical geography is the basis, not only of special geography, but also of geology
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and that just when Humboldt was vitiating his description of Asia with Elie de

Beaumont's speculations on the origin of mountains, and was conveying the

impression that general geography was equivalent to the entirety of natural science,

Lyell was shaping physical geography to the ends of the geologist, and making it a

key to unlock the past. The result, so far as geography is concerned, may be seen

at the present day in the time-table of many an English girls' school. Separate

hours are set apart for ' physical geography ' and for ' geography.' The one is studied

with a text-book written from the geological standpoint, the other in a manual

of mere names lit up occasionally with a few ideas drawn from Ritter or Strabo.

Thus it was that geography was divorced from physical geography to be unequally

yoked with history. Peschel restored physical geography to the geographer, and

made it the implement of analj-sis in the held of Liinderkunde.

But while the geographers had gone astray in the wake of Humboldt, the

geologists neglected that great chapter of their subject which they hold to-day

in common with the geographers. Stratigraphy, palaeontology, and mineralogy

claimed their first attention, and it was only after a time that Ramsay and Geikie

among the English geologists, and Dana among the Americans, began to study

--what we now call geomorphology the causal description of the earth's present

relief. It was Peschel who asserted the claim of geography to include geomorpho-

logy, and so rendered possible a genetic, as opposed to a merely conventional classi-

fication of the features of relief. Though common to both studies, it plays a

different part in each. The geologist looks at the present that he may interpret

the past ; the geographer looks at the past that he may interpret the present. The

geographer's argument begins, as we have said, with the surface of the earth, but

to his almost artistic perception of land-forms he must add a causal analysis pre-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

cisely as the artist learns anatomy the better to grasp the human outlines.

    Peschel's criticism of Ritter is less happy than that which he gave to Hum-

boldt. He complains of Ritter's use of the expression ' Comparative Geography,' and

substitutes another of his own. As a matter of fact, all geography which is not

merely descriptive must be comparative, and the various uses of the term made by

different writers are but particular cases of one of the most general ideas in scien-

tific method. Vareuius called all geography comparative that was not mathe-

matical or astronomical. Ritter compared peoples with the lands they inhabited,

in order to establish the influence of environment. Peschel compared one physical

feature with another, with the object of discovering their origin. Markham uses

comparative geography to imply a comparison of historical records, with a view

to showing the changing aspects of the same locality at different times. Peschel's

difference with Ritter is, in this matter, a merely verbal quibble. Nor can we say

much more with reference to his obvious dislike of Ritter's teleological views,

which, though they colour every statement he makes, yet do not affect the essence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

it is easy to re-state each proposition in the most modern evolutionary terms.

Where, however, Peschel questions the adequacy of particular correlations of peoples

and environments, it must be admitted that he usually strikes between the joints,

and this is still more evident when he has to deal with Ritter's daring follower,

Buckle. The truth of the matter is that Ritter and Buckle had taken for their

field the highest and most difficult chapter in geography, and that they underrated
Wethe complexity of the problems with which they had to deal.
                                                                 are all familiar

with the saying that it required the Greeks in Greece to develop the Athenian

civilisation, and that neither the Greeks elsewhere, nor any other race in Greece,

would have been equal to the achievement. It would be easy for a Peschel to

demonstrate the falsity of an assertion that the Greeks owed all to Greece, but,

on the other hand, the Ritters and Buckles were in error in attempting so simple

an explanation. What seems to have been constantly omitted from these specu-

lations is the fact that communities can move from one environment to another
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

that even a given environment alters from generation to generation ; and that an

existing community is often the product of two or more communities in past

generations, each of them subject to a different environment. Now, the influences
--744 REPORT 1895.

affecting a community at a given time may be resolved into dynamic and genetic.

Among the dynamic influences, geograpbical environment is admittedly important.
But the genetic influences are the momentum from the past, and the genetic in-
fluences acting on this generation may be resolved into the dynamic and genetic of
the last. If this process be repeated through many generations, it is clear that the

sum total of geographical influence is always accumulating. The Normans, for
instance, were exposed to successive environments in Norway and in Normandy,

and much that was out of place in Normandy was due to the earlier action of Norway.

The American, again, has characteristics and institutions which could hardly have

been cradled in the Mississippi plain, but are explainable by a reference to the

Apeninsulas and islands of Europe.                                                                       very striking instance of the errors involved

both in Ritter's methods and Peschel's criticismis to be found in the case of China.

Peschel assumes that the Chinese civilisation grew up in China, and asserts that a

land of so massive an outline was not fitted to stimulate such a growth. But the

most modern research tends to show that the Chinese were not thtis isolated in

early times, and that Chinese civilisation was of Western, not home origin. Ritter

erred in thinking the action simple and uniform, Peschel in underestimating its

cumulative infltieuce.

Since the war of 1870, geographical chairs have been multiplied through-

out Europe, and especially in Germany, and at the present time German-

speaking geographers form a little public of themselves. Some of the Professors,

as Ton Richthofen of Berlin and Peuck of Vienna, have worked mainly at

geomorphology                                                                           others, such as  Kriimmel of Kiel, at oceanography ;  others,  again,
                                                                                     ;

such as Ratzel of Leipzig, at anthropogeography ; wliile Wagner of Gottingen

has been conspicuous in cartography, and Kirchhott' of Halle and Lehmann

of Miinster in questions of method. Davis of flarvard and Woeikof of St. Peters-

burg may count as foreign adherents of the German school. There can be no doubt

that it is especially in geomorphology that the advance has been most rapid, and

here we may trace Peschel's impulse still nnexhatisted. In 1887 Gerland of

Strasburg went so far as wholly to exclude the human element from geography,
and to make it a purely physical science. He probably represents the extreme

swing of the pendulum. There is evidence now of a reaction towards Ritter, and

as Wagner has pointed out, we owe to Gerland himself the admirable series of

maps in the new edition of Berghaus's Atlas, which deals with man, and brings

out with startling clearness the interdependence of relief, climate, and population.

    Let us now sum up the problems and methods of modern geography as they

have resulted from the last five generations of work and criticism. Merely verbal

definitions may be left to the dialectician, but there are two diflerent modes of

giving practical definition to a department of knowledge. It may be considered

either as a discipline, or as a field of research. As a discipline, a subject

requires rough definition for the purposes of organisation. It should exhibit a

central idea or a consistent chain of argument. On the other hand, no theo-

retical considerations can hold the investigator within set bounds, though he is

none the less practically limited by the nature of the arts of investigation to

which he has served bis apprenticeship. The chemist should manipulate the blow-

pipe, the physicist should be an expert mathematician, the historian should

be skilful as a paleographer, and familiar with mediisval Latin. That subject

is most legitimate which admits of either definition, which exhibits both a con-

sistent argument and also characteristic arts. The researcher will then be the

writer of the text-book, and while research is fertilised by suggestions born of

teaching, teaching will be illuminated by the certainty within uncertainty which

comes of first hand touch with facts. Geography satisfies both requirements ; it

has arts and an argument.

    There are three correlated arts (all concerned chiefly with maps) which may be

--said to characterise geography observation, cartography, and teaching. The observer

obtains the material tor the maps, which are constructed by the cartographer

and interpreted by the teacher. It is almost needless to say that the map is here
thought of as a subtle instrument of expression applicable to many orders of facts,

and not the mere depository of names which still does duty in some of the most costly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            a

English atlases. Speaking generally, and apart from exceptions, we have had in

England good observers, poor cartographers, and teachers perhaps a shade worse

than cartographers. As a result, no small part of the raw material of geography is

English, while the expression and interpretation are German.

     The geographical argument has already been sketched. The first chapter deals

--with geomorphology the half artistic, half genetic consideration of the form of

the lithosphere. The second chapter might be entitled geophysiology ; it postu-

--lates a knowledge of geomorphology, and may be divided into two sections oceano-

graphy and climatology. At the head of the third and last chapter, is the word

* biogeography,' the geography of organic communities and their environments.

This chapter postulates all that has preceded, and within the chapter itself each

later section presupposes whatever has gone before. To each later section and

chapter there is an appendix, dealing with the reaction of the newly-introduced

element on the elements which have been considered earlier. Finally, there is a

supplement to the whole volume, devoted to the history of geography, or the develop-

ment of geographical concepts and nomenclature.

The anthropogeographer is in some sense the most typical and complete of

geographers. His special department requires a knowledge of all the other

departments. He must study geomorphology without becoming a geologist,

geophysiology without becoming a physicist, biogeography without becoming a

biologist. It has been recognised ever since the time of Strabo that geography cul-

minates in the human element, but the difficulties in the way of precise thought in

this branch of the subject are such that, while its claims have been constantly

reasserted, the other branches have hitherto made greater progress. At all times

each race exhibits a great variety of initiative, the product, in the main, of its

past history. In each age certain elements of this initiative are selected for

success, chiefly by geographical conditions. Sometimes human genius seems to

set geographical limitations at defiance, and to introduce an incalculable element

into every problem of anthropogeography. Yet, as we extend our survey over

wider periods, the significance even of the most vigorous initiative is seen to

diminish. Temporary effects contrary to Nature may be within human possi-

bilities, but in the long run Nature reasserts her supremacy. Celt, Roman, and

Teuton successively neglected the Alpine and the Pyrenean frontiers, but modern

history has vindicated their power. Probably, when it is fully recognised that

the methods of anthropogeography are essentially the same as those of physical

geography, advance will become more rapid. The facts of human geography, like

those of all other geography, are the resultant for the moment of the conflict of
two elements, the dynamic and the genetic. Geographical advantages of past times

permitted a distribution and a movement of men which, by inertia, still tend to
maintain themselves even in the face of new geographical disadvantages. Economic

or commercial geography should probably be regarded as the basal division of the

treatment. The streams of commodities over the face of the earth, considered as
an element in human environments, present many analogies to the currents of the

ocean or the winds of the air. Strategical opportunities, also, have a constant action

on communities, in the shape of tempting or threatening possibilities. Political

geography becomes reasonable when the facts are regarded as the resultant in large

measure, of genetic or historical elements, and of such dynauiic elements as the

economic and strategic.

     This being our conception of geography, it seems not without interest to sketch

our ideal geographer. He is a man of trained imagination, more especially with

--the power of visualising forms and movements in space of three dimensions

power difficult of attainment, if we are to judge by the frequent use of telluria and
models. He has an artistic appreciation of land forms, obtained, most probably, by

pencil study in the field ; he is able to depict such forms on the map, and to read
them when depicted by others, as a musician can hear music when his eyes read

a silent score; he can visualise the play and the conflict of the fluids over and

around the solid forms ; he can analyse an environment, the local resultant of
                                                                         ;

world-wide systems ; he can picture the movements of communities driven hy

their past history, stopped and diverted by the solid forms, conditioied in a thousand

vpays by the fluid circulations, acting and reacting on the communities around he
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

can even visualise the movement of ideas and of words as they are carried along-

the lines of least resistance. In his cartographic art he possesses an instrument of

thought of no mean power. It may or may not be that we can think without words,

Abut certain it is that maps can save the mind an infinitude of words.   map

may convey at one glance a whole series of generalisations, and the comparison

of two or more maps of the same region, showing severally rainfall, soil, relief,

density of population, and other such data, will not only bring out causal relation.'^,

but also reveal errors of record; for maps may be both suggestive and critical.

"With his visualising imagination and his facile hand, our ideal geographer is well

equipped, whether he devote himself to a branch of geography or to other fields of

energy. As a cartographer he would produce scholarl)' and trraphic maps ; as
a teacher he would make maps speak ; as an historian or biologist he would insist

on the independent study of environment instead of accepting the mere obiter dicta

of the introductory chapters of histories and text-books ; and as a merchant, soldier,

or politician he would exhibit trained grasp and initiative when dealing with

practical space-problems on the earth's surface. There are many Englislunen who

possess naturalh' these or compensating powers, but England would be richer if

more of such men, and others besides, had a real geographical training.

Let us consider for a moment the methods of organisation b}- which the German

results have been produced. There are two systems of examination important to

--geography the philosophical doctorate of the Universities, and the facultas docendi

of the State. Candidates for the doctorate present three subjects, one major and

two minor, selected according to the taste or requirements of the student. Young

geographers usually present themselves in geography as major, and in history and

geology as minor subjects. The State examination for the fdcultas docendi is of

greater severity and of more general efi'ect, in that every secondary teacher must

hold the Government quaUfication in the subjects he teaches. As long ago as the

time of Mr. Keltie's report, a single professor, Wagner of Gottingen, had

examined in geography 200 candidates for the facultas docendi. It is a conse-

quence of this system that at the last meeting of the Deutsche Geographentag

there was an attendance of oOO members, mosUi/ specialist teachers of geography ;
and, as a farther consequence, there is a market for good maps in the German-

speaking lands, whereas in England, reformers are constantly daunted by the fact

that the public actually 2)rcfers the bad to the good. English specialists are almost

invariably compelled to use German maps.

In most German Universities there is now a Geographical Institute, possessed

of lecture-rooms and work-rooms, with appliances and collections ; and the
teaching combines lecture, seminar, cartographical exercise, written thesis, and

field practice. At Vienna, for instance, there are two professors of geography

in joint charge of an institute founded in 1885. The institute has a j-early sub-

vention from the State, and in 1801 had a library of 2,400 volumes, the necessary

globes and telluria, and an equipment of instruments for observation and carto-

graphy, besides 131 wall maps, 27 relief models, 135 diagrams, 370 typical views

{Characterbilder) , 1,200 photographs, 148 bound atlases, and about 5,000 separate

maps. There were also a collection of rock-specimens, used more especially to

convey the necessary geological ideas to the Jlistoriker (who form a majority of

the students), and a series of typical school-books and school atlases for the

benefit of teachers. Professor Penck remarks that the neighbourhood of Vienna

is in itself an admirable laboratory for every department of geography. It should

be carefully noted that the University Institutes compete neither with geographical

societies nor with public libraries, in that books and specimens of rare or unique

character are excluded from the collections, which are solely for the use of the

students of the institute.

In England geography has no appreciable position in degree-examinations

there are no examinations at all for the post of secondary teacher, nor

is there anywhere in the land anything really comparable to the German
                                                                 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.              747

Geographical Institute. Since 1869 the Royal Geographical Society has made

repeated efforts to alter the situation, and it would be an error not to recognise that

we are on the upward gradient. The Society's policy has been embodied chiefly in

--four measures the offer of medals to the great public schools ; the ajjpointment of

an inspector to report on foreign geographical teaching : the foundation of lecturer-

ships in the universities, and the institution of a system of training for explorers.

After sixteen years of trial the medals were discontinued on the ground that they

affected only a few schools, and even in those schools only a few pupils. Out of a

total of 62 medals awarded, no iewer than 30 fell to two schools ; a noteworthy fact,
as indicating at once the power and the rarity of skilled and enthusiastic geo-

graphical teaching. The most significant result of Mr. Keltie's report, and of the
exhibition of specimens collected by him and now deposited with the Teachers"
Guild in Gower Street, has been a general improvement in school text-books and

maps, as seen particularly in some of the better elementary schools and training
colleges. The university lecturerships have been effective only at Oxford for a suf-

ficient time to judge of results. There, a considerable class of historical students

attend lectures in geography twice a week, but are not likely to give the time

necessary for more thorough study without the stimulus of examination. None
the less, students who have heard lectures are gradually spreading geographical

ideas, and the mere existence of the lecturerships is a valuable admission that the

study is one of University rank. The classes for explorers have been conspicuously
successful, and are probably the best of their kind in the world. But here we are

dealing with those arts of observation in which, as already remarked. Englishmen

excel.

    With the example of Germany before us, with partial success to encourage

us, with the interest aroused by the recent Geographical Congress to aid us, and

with the reorganisation of secondary teaching impending, is not this the ripe oppor-

tunity for another, and it may be final effort, to make geography effective in
English education? I do not deny that there maybe several good roads to success,

but I cannot help feeling that our most immediate need is a certain amount of

centralisation. This is so for two reasons. First, because we English geographers

Werequire, above all things, a tradition.                                               varj' so widely in our views, and our

examiners examine so differentlj-, that teachers are at a loss whether to keep to

the old methods or venture on the new. The old classical education still main-

tains its supremacy, mainly because through strong tradition it is workable without

artificial  syllabus                                         it  is an organism rather  than a machine.  German geography,
                                                          ;

despite its modern growth, has a tradition, for Germans are all sons in geography

--of the ancestral group Humboldt, Ritter, Berhaus, and Perthes. Secondly, we

need a worthy object lesson, which is attainable under existing circumstances only

by the concentration of funds, and by the co-operation of several leaders.

For no single lecturer, such as the Universities at present maintain, can deal

Anadequately with all aspects of geography.                                             historical or classical student listens

to a dozen different teachers at Oxford or Cambridge. Berlin and Vienna have
each of them two professors of geography, besides Docenten. Moreover, a German

student may pass from university to university, and thus correct the limitations
of his teachers. Yet nothing short of a con.siderable object lesson in England

will bring general conviction as to the value and possibilities of geography. Nor
need we (ear that when centralisation has done its work, independent and local

initiative will not vary the general tradition. Furthermore, the centralisation should

not be complete. The work in progress at the Universities must not be abandoned.

It will :steadily gain importance in proportion as the central body does the work
for which it is designed.

     Clearly, if the policy of centralisation be agreed to, there is only one site for the
central school. It must be in London, under the immediate inspiration of that
Royal Geographical Society, whose past services to the cause would be a guarantee

of support during the early effTorts. But geographers must associate with

themselves experts in education, if they are to avoid certain rocks which have
knocked many a hole into the geographical projects of the past, and if public

bodies and private individuals are to be moved to financial generosity. The beginning
--748 REPORT 1895.

miglit be on a relatively small scale, but must not be too small for completeness.

Tbeory, both on the scientific and historical sides, must be represented, and each of

the three geographical arts. As regards observation nothing better could be asked

than association with the admirable classes already existing. Cartography would

be needed not only to supply the English map trade with an occasional Petermaun,

but especially that all serious students of the school might learn the ways of

the geographical workshop. Teaching would naturally be associated with the various
Asecondary and elementary training colleges.
                                              certain number of university men

might be tempted by the offer of a diploma to interpose a geographical year between

the university and the master's desk ; for head masters would probably be only

too glad to give the teaching of geography into the hands of specialists, provided

these were men of university culture, able to be of general service in school-work,

and provided also there was adequate guarantee that they were experts. There

would, in addition, be a system of eveuing classes for teachers and clerks, and thus,

while the school would render obvious and direct service to six millions of people,

the staff would gain strength from the sense of a generally difi'used trust in them.
The school would in no way duplicate the Geographical Society, while its staff
would contribute an element of tiained experts to the newly established afternoon

meetings.

     I launch this scheme, not with any fixed idea on the subject, for I would willingly

abandon it in favour of another shown to be better, but because I am convinced
that now is a great opportunity, and that a definite plan, even if it should prove

unworkable, is more likely to provoke discussion and to produce result than mere
negative criticism, which has often been anticipated. As effects of any adequate
scheme, I should hope that, in a few years" time, geographical examinations would
consistently test not merely' memory for small detail, but clearness of apprehension,
breadth of view, and power of statement, whether in word or map; that teachers
would have the knowledge needed for Socratic rather than dogmatic teaching, and

that students of geography would exercise the powers of analysis and composition,
and not merely observe and remember. Geography would then be a subject rather

for the higher than the lower parts of schools, and with the aid of a shelf of the
classics of travel, sixth-form boys would write geographical essays with rapid but
accurate mnp illustration. Then, the Universities would receive freshmen who,

whether candidates for historical or scientific honours, could express themselves

resourcefully in map and diagram, as well as in language and writing. I speak
from experience when I say that not one undergraduate in thirty has the necessary

equipment for accurate appreciation of space-relations in history, as well as time-

relations. In an age of inevitable but unfortunate specialisation the organising

of another correlating study should not be unwelcome.

Once more, let us emphasise the fact that geography is not the science of all

things. It has been the aim of this address to bring out the specific character of
geography and of the geographer. Nor is it the only important subject in educa-
tion. Its devotees frequently do it harm by excessive claims. Moreover, let us

admit that as geography is now too often taught, and even as it is conceived of in

some circles wliich pass for geographical, it merits no greater mercy than it re-
ceives at the hands of educationalists. Nor let it be denied that some facts that we
would see taught as geographical are already dealt with in other, and as we think,
less advantageous connections. Lastly, let us beware of extolling the German

example, which happens to be good in geography, to the degree of imputing in-

feriority to the whole system of English education. Let us do full justice to the
position of our opponents, let us humbly benefit by their criticism, and then claim

soberly, but with persistence, that a worthy geography is no pariah among intellec-
tual disciplines. Amid the changes of organisation which are imminent, let us
steadily maintain that the geographical is a distinct standpoint from which to

view, to analyse, and to group the facts of existence, and as such entitled to rank

with the theological or philosophical, the linguistic, the mathematical, the physical,

and the historical standpoints. No intellectual education is complete which does

not offer some real insight from each of these positions.

1. On a Journey in Tarhuna and Gharian in Tripoli.
             By H. SwAiNSON CowPER, F.S.A.

This short excursion was made with the express purpose of investigating a series

of megalithic ruins, which were known to exist, But of which nothing has been

hitherto known, except brief notices on one or two sites mentioned in the writings

of the travellers Earth and Von Bary. The author travelled first south-west, and

entered the Tarhuna district by the Wadl Doga, which appears never to have been

entered previously by an English traveller. The Wadi Doga is a fine valley about

800 feet above sea-level, surrounded by hills about 800 feet higher, and contains

numerous ancient sites of megalithic temples, some in a fair state of preservation.

Thence the author passed by Kasr Doga, a magnificent Roman monument described

by Barth, on to the Tarhuna plateau, a grassy and partly cultivated plain, twenty-

five miles from east to west and of unascertained width. Here the remains were

even more numerous than in Wadi Doga, there being hardly a hillock on the sum-

mit of which the remains of one of these megalithic temples could not be found.

Mr. Cowper camped on this plain with the family of his guide, and was throughout

treated with hospitality by the Tarhuni Arabs. These people are pastoral Arabs

of pure race, rigid Mussulmans, but apparently not fanatically inclined towards

Christians. They live in rows of tents during the winter, and in wattle huts

among their crops during summer. Some of them inhabit underground chambers

dug in the soil below the level of the ground.

     Leaving the Tarhuna plateau, the author rode north-east, and crossing the

Wadi Daun (which with two smaller Wadis which join it are full of Roman ruins

and crossed at frequent intervals by Roman dams) he reached the foot of Jebel

Msid, lying at the east end of a wide and beautiful valley called Kseia. Having

examined the ancient sites here, he retraced his steps to the Tarhuna plateau, which

he crossed to the south-west, and entered a country of more mountainous character.

These hills are partly in Tarhuna and partly in Gharian, and his route was crossed

at frequent intervals by important watercourses running north towards the coast.

The country, like the Tarhuna plateau, is nearly treeless, and in March very

Apoorly supplied with water.  few crumbling ruins, probably of Roman date, cap

the hills, but the megalithic sites are comparatively rare. Plouses in Gharian are,

as in Tarhuna, unknown, except at the Kasr, where there are Turkish troops.

Throughout the district game of any sort is most rare, nothing being seen

except quails, partridges, a few hares, and a wild cat. After crossing the Wadis

Bir el War and Gethathet Dum, the author arrived at Wadi el Ghan, a southern

prolongation of the important Wadi Haera, which leads straight to Tripoli. The

scenery down this Wadi is very fine, as it runs between grand clitfs of limestone

and sandstone, and at one place there is a fine hill of ferruginous clay.

Emerging from the mountains, the author passed a curious isolated group ot

hills lying on the plain like islands, and from this point a two days' journey across

the plain brought him to Tripoli.

     The following Papers were read :

        A1. Voyage to the Antarctic Sea. By C. E. Borchgrevink.

     More than half a century ago Sir James Clark Ross discovered the South

Victoria Continent.

     Nobody had visited those southern shores until last year, yvhen the whaler
' Antarctic ' forced her way through the ice-fields and ran into that large ice-free
bay which stretches from Cape Adare down to the volcanoes Erebus and Terror.
It seems strange that fifty-four years should have elapsed without any attempt
having been made to finish tbat work which was so bravely commenced by an
illustrious Briton. The more strange does this fact seem as the journals of the
Erebus and the Terror tell about vast new and promising fields for science and
commerce.

     The recent antarctic expedition was a commercial one, and it was com-
mercially a failure because we did not find the black or ' right ' whale, so valuable

for its whalebone.

     The ' Antarctic ' was fitted out for the hunt of that particular kind of whale,
but I have nevertheless no doubt that the commercial result of the recent expedi-

tion would have been much better had we worked under more favourable

auspices.

     I by no means consider the fact of our not having met with ' right ' whales in
those seas as a proof of their not existing in the bay at South Victoria Land. It
would seem to be incredible that Sir .Tames Clark Ross made a mistake as to the
existence of this valuable whale in southern latitudes.

    Of great commercial importance are the guano beds which we discovered, and
which ought to be well worth the attention of enterprising men of business.

     From the analysis of specimens of rocks which I brought back from the main-

laud, the presence of valuable minerals on the continent is proved, although the
lava flows and volcanic aspect of the coast-line do not speak favourably for the
presence of heavy metals near the surface. The discovery of a brownish grey
mica schist, evidently a very ancient sedimentary rock converted by heat and
pressure operating through a long period of time into its present schistose and
crystalline condition, together with the presence of ' granoUte,' indicates the possi-
bility of finding ore deposits, and is strongly in favour of a probable continuity

of land from Victoria Land across the south pole to Graham Land. Somewhat
similar schistose rocks are known to occur in the South Shetlands, south-east

from Cape Horn.
     The specimens from Possession Island are entirely composed of volcanic rocks.

They are chiefly fragments of what seems to be a basaltic rock apparently
belonging to flows of two diff'erent ages. The fragments belonging to the older
flow show evidence of the lava having been much frothed up by steam escaping
from its pores. It is of a reddish to pinkish brown tint. The newer lava is more
dense and is of a blackish grey colour. It is, however, impossible to describe
these rocks in detail until microscopic sections of them are completed.

    An investigation of the origin and consequences of the north-east current
which we experienced in the Victoria Bay is of great interest. When we look

upon the phenomena which cause and accompany the great currents of the ocean
in the northern hemisphere, we are justified in anticipating that also in the
southern hemisphere similar phenomena occur.

     The meteorology of the antarctic circle might throw a valuable light on the
origin of oceanic currents ; and it is not improbable that the warm current in the
bay at Victoria Land plays a similar, if even an inferior, part in the southern
hemisphere to that of the Gulf Stream in the northern.

     The constant light pressure of the air within both the arctic and the antarctic
circles seems remarkable. There is probably a similar movement from and towards
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                                     751

the pole in the air as there is in the water, so that there is constantly a rush of

cold air from the pole towards the equator, and this, combined with the slow

movements of the globe, with its air so near the axis of rotation, would form the

chief cause of this low pressure.

All through our voyage the westevly winds were predominant, but gradually

decreased in strength as we drew south of the Roaring Forties. In noting the

strength of winds. Sir James Ross's scale to 12 was used. The strongest winds

were noticed before we entered the antarctic circle, and not before we returned to
Wethe Forties again was wind of force 12 observed.
                                                    experienced then a very

furious gale of distinctly cyclonic character, turning spirally from north-west to

Wesouth, and reaching its maximum strength from the south.  had to use oil to

protect the ship from the furious breakers. All the time spent in the bay at

Victoria Land we experienced light southerly to south-easterly winds, and not once
a wind of strength above 5. From the formation of the snow peaks I should

think that the westerly winds prevail on the plateaux, and, should this be the case,

a land expedition would be greatly assisted in returning from the south magnetic

pole towards the bay by the use of sails on the sledges. Our heaviest snowfall

was experienced just before we entered the icefields on our return. On the night

of January 25, in latitude 69°, when the air was one dense white mass of snow,

the wiud being once up to 10 in strength, and surrounded by icebergs, our position

was far from safe. Although the thermometer did not fall below 30° F., it was a

cold and anxious watch in the crow's nest.

    We always observed the reflection of the icefields in the air, and we were thus

warned from far oS", even of the presence of a narrow stream of ice or of an ice-

berg; this ice blink and the presence of the Procellaria nivea never deceived us.

When the swell is heavy in the icepack, it is often very difficult to ascertain

from which side the swell comes, and as difficult as this is, so is it important, for

the safety of the ship depends upon a right judgment in these emergencies. When

the huge ice masses begin to move and screw and press on the sides of the vessel,

--which rises and falls in the heavy swell, there is but one escape namely, to work

the vessel into the fields away from the side from which the gale blows.

Birds of the snipe family were discovered at the Campbell Island. Nests of

the black-bellied storm-petrel were found on the rocks of Victoria Land, which is,
therefore, the home of this hardy petrel. The white petrel, the Procellaria nivea,

seemed also to nest at Oape Adare, where it lived in peace with the penguins.

The penguins on Possession Island, and on the mainland, were all distinctly dif-

ferent from those seen at the Campbell Island.

The northern penguins, rock-hopper penguin {Eudyptes saltator), were all

crested, that is to say, they had over each eye a tuft of long yellow feathers, which

gives them an appearance of Mephistopheles in miniature, and their hoarse scream

just suits their peculiar look.

The penguins which we met in the pack on Possession Island, and on the

mainland, were the short-bellied penguin {Eudyptes adelice). Four specimens of

Aptenodytes Forsteri, the large, lonely penguin, were secured. They had several

pounds of pebbles in their stomachs.

     It was noticed that the plumage of birds gradually changed into lighter colours

as we drew southwards.

   --Four kinds of seals were seen the white seal ; the sea-leopard ; the earless

seal ; and the common grey seal.

     The difference in the formation of arctic and antarctic ice is known to be very
gi'eat. While the northern bergs mostly consist of a large ice mass running up in

numberless towers and arches resembling the very mountain peaks which sur-

rounded the glaciers which gave rise to them, the antarctic bergs are solid masses

of floating ice with perpendicular walls, and an unbroken plateau on the top.

All the bergs showed distinctly whether they were broken from the large

southerly barrier, or were discharged from the glaciers of South Victoria Continent.

All the barrier bergs had very distinct blue lines across their walls, indicating

former. The peaks and towers of the arctic icebergs are supposed to have been
formed by the influence of ocean-currents wearing away the softer part of the ice
mass under water until the natural action of gravitation causes them to upset. But

why have the antarctic icebergs a different form, for there are great currents in
the antarctic waters ? And icebergs which have reached as far north as the south
of New Zealand maintain this antarctic character. I can see no other reason for

this dissimilarity between the bergs of the north and those of the south, but that
the arctic icebergs as a rule must pass through climates which in temperature

rapidly change from one extreme to another, and that they take much longer time

in floating southwards than the antarctic icebergs do in moving northwards.

  2. The Oceanography of the North Sea. By H. N. Dickson, F.R.S.JE.

     This paper gives some accoimt of recent physical work in the North Atlantic,
the North 8ea and the Baltic, in which the Swedish, German, Danish, Norwegian
and British Governments have co-operated. The surface phenomena at different
seasons are discussed, a special report on that section of the joint work having been
drawn up by the author.

     The importance of further research, especially in the interests of our fishing
industries, is pointed out, and an international scheme, due to Professor Pettersson

of Stockholm, described.

             4. The Maps used by Herodotus. By J, L. Myres, M.A.

The geographical digressions in the History of Herodotus are intended to

supply the place of an atlas, and can be partially reinterpreted into pictorial form.

That such pictorial maps were used, even before Herodotus's time, is clear from

V. 49. Herodotus's descriptions are intentionally diagrammatic, and only give

skeleton-outlines, on which the details are understood to be tilled in. The general

proportions are indicated, not by formal latitude and longitude (ascribed to

Eratosthenes), but (1) by lists of places which are in the same straight line (ii. 34,

iv. 181 ff.), and by columns of names which run up and down or across the map

(iv. 37, V. 49), which is thus subdivided into rectangular areas (iv. 37, 99), or parallel

strips (iv.                                   181)                     (2)  by the presumption that a general symmetry is maintained   in
                                                                    ;

the distribution of land and water N. and S. of a natural ' equator ' (ii. 26, 33
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

iii. 115; iv. 36, 37).

This 'equator' is indicated in two different real-latitudes in the different

digressions, and these two 'equators' are associated with different principal

N. and S. meridians.

Hence we may infer that Herodotus used two distinct maps based upon inde-

--pendent traditions and explorations, each best adapted to illustrate a different

section namely, the Greek and the Persian 'halves' of the known world^but

not consistent with one another in the parts where they overlap.

representing the meridian either of Susa or of Ecbatana. From this project west-

-- --ward two promontories Asia Minor and Arabia washed respectively on their

outward sides by the Euxine and the ' Eed Sea.' Arabia ' in theoretical geography
leaves off' at the Isthmus of Suez, as Asia Minor does at the Dardanelles, but is
* practically found to be continuous ' with Libya (iv. 39). Between the Peninsulre

lies the ' Mediterranean ' Sea, with Cyprus in its axis (cf. v. 49) ; the Equator
bisects the Mediterranean from the Pillars of Herakles, through Cyprus, to the

Phojnician coast ; thence (probably through Ecbatana) down the Pactyas river
(perhaps the Ganges) into the Eastern Ocean. The southern coast line of Asia is

determined by the voyage of Skylax (iv. 44) ; the northern is inferred thence by
symmetrv, and accommodated to the known Caspian (iv. 40).

     The current controversy as to the frontiers of the continents refers also to these
same maps (iv. 36, 39, 41,45, 197), and to the map of Hecataeus (iv. 4.5), and is
explained, together with the distortion of the eastern half of the known world, by
the dithculty of apportioning a circular world among three traditionally equal

continents, one of which, Libya, has since been determined to occupy only one

quadrant of the circle, and to be bounded by the S. half meridian and the W.

half equator, while the opposite quadrant remains still practically unknown.

T). On the Sixth International Geographical Congress, London, 1895.
                By Major Leonard Darwin, Sec. R.G.S.

   A short historical account of the (Congress may be usefully included in the

proceedings of the Section, so as to make them a complete record of the scientific

year.

     Five international geographical congresses have been held in various European

centres during the last twenty-five years, but this is the first time that this inter-

national gathering has assembled in England. The Royal Geographical Society
took the initiative in the matter of organisation, and the President of the Royal
Geographical Society, Mr. Clements Markham, was, according to precedent,
nominated President of the Congress, Mr. J. S. Keltie and Dr. H. R. Mill being

appointed Secretaries. An exliibition was arranged in connection with the Con-

gress which, whilst it entailed much labour on Mr. Ravenstein, Mr. Coles, and
Mr. Thomson, who organised it, proved an attractive feature of the meeting.

     The Congress was formally opened on the evening of Friday, July 26, by H.R.H.
the Duke of York, one of the honorary presidents. On the following day the
President delivered his opening address, in which he reviewed the present position
of geographical science. In the afternoon two sections met. The question of

surveying by photography was dealt with in one section, whilst in the other a

very interesting discussion on education took place. Professor E. Levasseur dis-
cussed the French educational system, and pointed out the desirability of making
geography less a matter of memory, which could only be done by making it em-

brace a wider area of thought. Dr. Lehmann and Mr. Herbertson advocated higher

training for geographical teachers, the latter pointing out that instruction in

geogi-aphy in England in secondary schools was even in a worse position than in

primary schools. Mr. H. J. Mackinder, in opening the discussion, showed that in

England we are far behind both France and Germany in University and in secon-

dary geograj)hical training, and suggested the establishment of a geographical

institute in London. Mr. H. Yule Oldham spoke in favour of the development of

Ageography at Oxford and Cambridge.  small committee drafted the following

resolution, which was afterwards adopted by the Congress : 'The attention of this

International Congress having been drawn by the British members to the educa-

tional efforts being made by the British Geographical Societies, the Congress de-

sires to express its hearty sympathy with such efforts, and to place on record its

opinion that in every country provision should be made for higher education in

geography, either in the Universities or otherwi.se.'

Monday, July 30, was devoted in great part to the polar regions. Dr. G.

Neumayer dwelt on the great scientific advantages of antarctic researcli, especi-
ally with regard to terrestrial magnetism. He urged international co-operation as

the only means for securing adequate results. In the discussion which followed,

he was supported by the great v/eight of the authority of Sir Joseph Hooker and

Dr. John Murraj', and a resolution advocating the necessity of antarctic explora-

tion by an expedition before the close of the present century was unanimously

passed by the Congress. Arctic travel was discussed, the first two papers being by
Admiral A. H. Markham and General Greely. Herr S. A. Andr6e's bold pro-

posal to reach the north pole by means of a balloon attracted most attention. His

scheme consists in filling a balloon at some convenient spot within the arctic circle,

and then waiting for a favourable wind before setting forth. Experiments made by

him have proved that, by the aid of drag ropes and sails, balloons can be made tO'

deviate from the direction of the wind as much as 27° on an average, and he

pointed out that the arctic regions were especially favourable for such operations

because of the equable temperature, the absence of gales, and the nature of the

surface of the ground.

The sections which met in the afternoon were concerned with physical geo-

graphy and geodesy-. Papers were read on the Jlodification of the Normandy

Coasts, by M. S. Lennier, and on the Periodic Variations of French Glaciers, by

Prince Roland Bonaparte. In the geodesy section, M. Charles Lallemand gave some

account of the work of the French surveys, and papers were read by General J. T.

Walker, Colonel Holdich, Mr. de Smidt, and Dr. Gill, on the geodetic work of the

Indian and Cape of Good Hope Survey Departments.

On Tuesday the general meeting of the Congress was devoted to receiving

reports on matters referred from the last Congress. The most important subject

Avas Profes.sor Penck's proposed map of the world. The report of the Commission

was unanimously adopted by the Congress. It stated that the production of a map

of the  earth  is  exceedingly desirable                                                                                                                                            that  a  scale  of 1 : 1,000,000  is  especially

suited  for that   purpose                                        and                                                                                                    that  the  meridian  of Greenwich  and the metre be

accepted for this map. Tlie last statement is of peculiar importance in having the

warm support of the French members of the Commission.

Professor Rriickner presented a Report on a Scheme for an International Bibli-

ography of Geography, and a resolution was passed, remitting to the Bureau of

the Congress the study of this question. Mi-. Frank Campbell read a paper, in

which he proposed that each Government should annually issue a proper register

of the literature of that country issued during the year in a form suitable to the

--requirements of bibliography                                                                                                                                           and a resolution dealing with this subject was
                                                                                                                                                                      ;
passed ' That this Congress expresses its approval of the principle of State Printed

Registration of Literature as the true foundation of National and International

Bibliography, and approves the appointment of an International Committee to

further the said object ; the constitution of the committee to rest with the Bureau

of the International Geographical Congress.'

     The sectional meetings were devoted to oceanography and geographical ortho-

--graphy and definitions ; and a resolution was passed ' That an International Com-

mittee be appointed to determine how far agreement can be arrived at as to the
mode of writing foreign names.'

HowOn Wednesday the question as to '                                                                                                                                                      far is tropical Africa suitable for de-

velopment by white races ? ' was raised and produced a most interesting debate.

Sir John Kirk commenced by reading a paper in which he distinguished between

areas where true colonisation might be possible, and areas where white men might

reside temporarily to superintend the labour of natives. After discussing fully the

conditions necessary to render colonisation possible, he expressed the belief that

there existed in tropical Africa considerable areas where the climate was such as to

enable Europeans to become indigenous, and where the conditions as to health were

Heprobably not prohibitive, though on this latter point information was scanty.

Dr. Sambon, Dr. JMurie and Mr. Louis took part. Slatin Pasha also gave an
interesting account of his escape from the Sudan. Later in the day General Chap-

man read a paper on the Mapping; of Africa, and a committee having been ap-

pointed to consider the question, the follo%ving resolutions were carried unanimously
by the Congress at a later meeting :

     ' That it is desirable to bring to the notice of the Geographical Societies
interested in Afirica the advantages to be gained :

    (1) By the execution of accurate topographical surveys based on a sufficient

                triangulation of the districts in Africa suitable for colonisation by

                   European.s.

    (2) By encouraging travellers to sketch areas rather than mere routes.
    (3) By the formation and publication of a list of all the places in unsurveyed

               Africa, which have been accurately determiued by astronomical obser-
                vations, with explanations of the methods employed.

    (4) By the accurate determination of the position of many of the most important

                places in unsurveyed Africa, for which operation the lines of telegraph

                  already erected, or in course of erection, afford great facilities.'

Only one section met in the afternoon, at which Professor Pettersson's scheme

Afor further international work in the North Sea was considered.  resolution to

the following effect was passed by the Congress on its last day of meeting:

' That the Congress recognises the scientific and economic importance of the

results of recent research in the Baltic, the North Sea, and the North Atlantic,

especially with regard to fishing interests, and records its opinion that the survey

of these areas should be continued and extended by the co-operation of the different

nationalities concerned, on the lines of the scheme presented to the Congress by

Professor Pettersson.'

    On Thursday, Mr. 0. E. Borchgrevink read an interesting paper, in which be

described liis antarctic voyage. Professor Kan then read a paper on New Guinea,

and Mr. Lindsay discussed future exploration in Australia. One of the sectional

meetings was devoted to cartography ; Professor Elisee lieclus reading a paper on

a proposed terrestrial globe on the scale of 1 : 100,000. In the other section, Dr.

Naumann compared the fundamental lines of Anatolia and Central Asia, and Mr.

Henry G. Bryant gave an account of observations on the most northern Eskimo,

chiefly made during the Peary Relief Expedition.

Friday's papers were of interest mainly to specialists. The general session dealt

chiefly with ancient maps, a paper by Baron Nordenskiold being presented bj' the

President, and a very valuable discussion of the origin of the sea-mile, given by

Professor H. Wagner. The sections had papers on spelseology and mountain

structure, and on the geographical nomenclature and the morphology of the earth,

by Professor Penck.

On Saturday only one paper was read, by General Annenkoff, on the importance

Aof geography in the present agricultural and economical crisis.  series of resolu-

tions, drawn up by the various committees or submitted by private individuals,

were put to the meeting. The President then delivered a short concluding address,

and dissolved the Congress.

Experience had shown that if the Congress were divided into a large number of

sections, papers would be brought forward dealing with points of detail, and larger

questions, which alone ought to be considered on such an occasion, would not

receive a proper amount of attention. The plan was therefore adopted of having

a morning meeting of the whole Congress, and in the afternoon having only two

sectional meetings. During the time when the Congress was being organised a

limited number of subjects were especially selected as being suitable for treatment

at great international gatherings, and a number of gentlemen were approached to

ascertain whether they would be willing to read papers thereon. These special

papers formed the basis of the work of the meeting.

   A consultative body was appointed at the Congress consisting of all the

acting Vice-Presidents, gentlemen nominated as representing all countries and as

especially qualified to consider every geographical subject. This consultative

                                                                  3c2
                                       ----

--756 REPORT 1895.

 body reported to the Congress its opinion with regard to every question about to

 be submitted to it, and this opinion carried so much weight that the views of the
 Vice-Presidents were in every case accepted by the Congress as a whole.

       Another useful innovation is the resolution that the officers of each Inter-
 national Geographical Congress are to retain their duties until the meeting of the
 next Congress. The Congress only meets once in three or four years, and in the
 interval there has been no authority charged with the duty of seeing that the

 resolutions passed are cai-ried out. Continuity of action is now secured.

     The total number attending the Congress was about 1,500, of whom about 600

 wei-e foreigners, including most of the professors of geography in the world. The
 bringing together of so many workers in one science was, in all probability, one of
 the most beneficial effects of the Congress, and plenty of independent evidence
 could be brought forward to show how much our foreign guests appreciated our

  efforts to entertain them.

      The Congress has never met in Germany, and it was decided that the next

 meeting should be held in Berlin in the year 1899.

6. On the Cosmosphere : an instrument combining the Terrestrial and

       Celestial Globes for the purpose of demonstrating Astronomical-Geogra-

    2)hical Phenomena and Navigational Problems. By W. B. Blaikie.

     The cosmosphere is a form of globe in which the celestial sphere is a trans-
parent film mounted with an independent motion outside the terrestrial sphere and
concentric with it. The two spheres are connected with a tinatiug horizon auto-
matically adjusting itself to auy latitude to be examined, thereby showing the
student the actual apparent motions of the heavenly bodies from the standpoint of
the observer; it also enables him, by measuring from the zenith and the horizon,
to see and practise the problems in geodesy and navigation which have to be
solved by travellers and navigators.

     1. An Expedition to Ruioenzori. By G. F. Scott Elliot, M.A.

     The journey of which this is an account was undertahen with funds partly sup-
plied by the Government Grant Committee of the Koyal Society, and partly by

myself.

     The general route which I adopted was as follows:
     I left Mombasa in November 1893, and travelled up to Kampala, Uganda, by
the ordinary route. I was unable to visit Elgon, and obliged to remain a month
in Kampala on account of the war with Kabbarega which was then in progress.

During this time Captain Gibb, Acting Administrator, entertained me with the

very greatest kindness. After a month's delay, there seemed to be no chance of

definite news from Unyoro, so I passed down through Buddu to the Kagera, which
I was anxious to visit. I crossed this river at Kitangule and followed its course

for six or seven days westwards. I then struck across Ankole to Ruwenzori.
     After four mouths spent on the mountain, I turned southwards again, reaching

the Kagera river at Latoma. I followed it as nearly as I could manage across
Karagwe and then turned across Uruudi and Bugufu towards Tanganyika, which
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  757

I reached in September. I came down Tanganyika in an Arab dhow, and after-

wards crossed the Stevenson Iload and arrived in the Shir(5 Highlands, eventually
emerging from the continent at Chiude, the mouth of the Zambesi.

     The earlier part of the journey was over very well known ground, and I shall
therefore begin by trying to point out the relative position of Ruwenzori, which
was the objective point of the expedition.

     It rises in a very isolated fashion out of an area which is depressed relatively
to the Victoria region plateau. The levels of the Albert Edward Nyanza and
Semiliki Valley are both lower than that of the Victoria Nyanza, which is the
lowest portion of the granite plateau usually called Uganda.

     Ruwenzori is 16,500 feet in height. Dr. Gregory, in a paper to be published
in the Journal of the Geological Society, has pointed out grounds for supposing
that it is a ' schoU ' mountain. The central core, of which I brought home a speci-
men, has been, in a sense, forced through the schists, Avhich I found to dip away
from it in all directions.

      It is allowable to suppose that this process resulted in lines of crack or weakness.

I found along what may be supposed to be lines of weakness of this kind a series
of relatively recent volcanic craters and crater lakes. The most important is that
which has produced the division of the Albert Edward into the Nyanza proper and
Lake Ruisamba. The Salt Lake and four other craters belong to this line, which

is approximately south-east. There is another running south-west, and along the
eastern side one finds at least two others ; one, at Vijongo, is in a north-easterly

direction, whilst the other is nearly due east from Kyatwa and Butanuka.

     These have all had the most important effect on the geography of the country
round the mountain, but this cannot be clearly shown without a large-scale map.

The recent volcanic area also extends across the Albert Edward and occupies a

stretch of its eastern shore.

     It seems strange that the mountain escaped notice so long, but it is obviously
the ' Blue Mountains ' of Sir S. Baker and the ' mountains of Usongora ' which recur

frequently in Emin Pasha's letters.
     The reason is probably the way in which it is frequently covered with clouds.

At about 10 A.M. thick clouds usually hang at an average level of 7,000 feet to
11 ,000 feet, though they are much lower in the narrower valleys. As the morning
advances, they gradually ascend, and may vanish altogether at about 5.30 p.m. In

fact, before r).30 p.m., or occasionally just about sunrise, it is most unusual to see
the summit except from a very great distance.

     The vegetation follows the average movement of this cloud belt. From 5,000
to 7,000 feet the surface is covered by shrubs and cultivation. The true mountain
forest begins at 7,000 feet, and extends to 8,600 feet. From 8,600 to 10,000 or
11,000 feet is a bamboo jungle; and from the latter level to 15,000 feet is a

heather zone.

     The forest is very dense, full of creepers, and with occasionally very fine timber.
Sometimes it contains tree ferns, and is extremely similar to the wet forests of

the Congo.

    Mammal and birds are scarce. Bush buck may be seen occasionally, and there
are Cercopit/ipcus n. sp., Colobus, probably a new species, various squirrels, Galago,

etc., but all are unusual. Butterflies also are particularly scarce.

     The bamboo region is always extremely cold and wet, and climbing is exces-
sively difficult and uncomfortable.

     The ground in the heather region is mainly a wet and soft peat moss. Amongst
this are mas.ses of Viola Abyssinica (which I saw visited by a new species of Ar-
gynnis, A. Elliotii Butler), Cerastiiim Africanum, Epilohium sp., Cardamine sp.,
and Hypericum. There are extremely large-fruited kinds of Rubus, and, in the
more sheltered ravines, enormous trees of Ericinella Johnstonei, as well as arbores-
cent Senecios, Hypcricacece, and the extraordinary tree Lobelia.

     The mountain is in reality a meeting-place of fioras.
     The higher altitude plants are probably of Abyssinian origin, and have a very
strong Mediterranean affinity. Those in many of the more humid and wet valleys
at from 6,600 to 7,600 feet are of a distinctly Western type, while in the drier
--758 REPORT 1895.

valleys below 5,000 feet one finds species of the Victoria regions, and above that
level plants of Abyssinian affinit_y or belonging to the Ankole-Karagwe hills.

     Besides all these sources, there are on this mountain many endemic forms.
     The different races of mankind show a curious analogy to the flora.
     Tlie Wahima, which form the nobility of all the eastern side, are a very late

immigration from Abyssinia.

    On the western side the Wawamba are certainly very closely related to the
Wanyuema tribes of the Upper Congo ; while the Wakondja, in the centre of the
mountain, which are part of the Bantu group (at least, so far as I could tell ; I am

not at all sure that they are not diflereut), correspond to the plants of the Ankole
and Karagwe hills.

    The Wahima {e.g. such high cliiefs as Kasagama and Makwenda, and the much

less mixed villages at Kakaruka and Buhimba) are very distinct from the others.
They have broad, prominent foreheads, small lips, and quite small and occasionally

retreating chins. They are tall and slender in build, and amongst them may be
seen occasionally individuals who have a very Semitic appearance. This race,
coming from Abyssinia, seems to have overcome, and now furnishes the nobility of,
all those tribes which border the Victoria. In the course of my journey 1 first

met them in Kavirondo, and reached their westward limit on the borders of the

Wawamba. Makowalli's people and all the tribes south of Latoma on the western

side of the Kagera are not, I think, Wahima, and I do not fancy they ever crossed
the Kagera below that point. In a southward direction I think they stop at
Buhimba and Kakaruka ; but beyond these places I did not go and cannot speak
from personal experience. They are easily distinguished from the Bantu races by
their extreme intelligence and dispositio]]. They are treacherous, rather sulky,
and also extremel)' licentious.

    The "N^'akondja, who have been conquered by them, are greatly oppressed. I
found them a simple, good-natured and industrious people of tlie regular negro

type.

    The Wawamba in manner, language, and custom, show distinct Wanyuema

affinities. They are different physically i'rom both the preceding races, but I found
them so timid and suspicious that I was quite unable to obtain any exact measure-
ments or learn the language. Unless the Wakondja contain amongst themselves
remnants of a far more primitive race (and I should not be surprised to learn that
this was the case), I do not believe there is an aboriginal people on Ruwenzori.
The distinction I have drawn of three races on the mountain will, however, be
found very marked.

     During the four months which I .spent on Ruwenzori I suffered greatly from
fever ; but I was able nevertheless to visit pretty thoroughly the Msonje, Yeria,

Wimi, Mubuku, Sebwe and Nyamwamba valleys on the east, and the Butagu on

the we.st. There are two important rivers on the south whose valleys I had not

time to visit, and on the east the Muhokia and Hima were not investigated. I

constantly attempted to reach the snow, but I never ascended higher than over

13,000 feet, which was in the Nyamwamba. I also nearly reached 13,000 feet on the

Butagu. I did reach the summit of the range near the sources of the Yeria river
on two occasions, but it was only about 11,000 feet at these places.

    On my return journey I crossed to Kwa Kaihura and thence through Mpororo,

Karagwe, Bugufu, Urundi to Tanganyilca.

                               By Captain S. L. Hinde,

     In 1891 Captain S. L. Hinde landed at Boma, and went up the caravan road to

Stanley Pool. After four months' residence in the neighbourhood of the Pool, part

of ·which was spent in exploring, he went up to the district of the Lualaba, and
                                                                                                                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                                                                                   759

arriving there was immediately ordered to join an exploring expedition to Katanga.
The force consisted of o")0 regular soldiers, a Krupp gun, and porters. While ou
the road to Katanga they were attacked by Tippo Tib's slave raiders, under the
command of his son Sefu. Alter the defeat of Sefu, a general rising of the
Mahometans and the federation of all the branches of Arab slave traders of the
Upper (jongo and its tributaries occurred. The war which ensued resulted in

the complete overthrow of the .Irab slave trade in equatorial Africa west of Tan-
ganyika. After the war Captain Hinde surveyed the unexplored parts of the
Lualaba and Lukunga, between Kasongo and JM'BuUi, connecting the surveys of
Joseph Thomson with those of Stanley and his successors. In these regions the

extreme fertility of the soil is noticeable. Owing to the intense heat, great
moisture, and alluvial sail, all forms of vegetable life grow with an incredible
rapidity. This vast tract of country is intersected by water ways navigable by
steamers for some thousands of miles, and, as can be realised, might easily be
exploited by Europeans.

     As a result of the Arab overthrow, the traffic which formerly went down to
Zanzibar from Nyangue and the Lualaba now follows the Congo to Stanley Pool
and the Atlantic. The whole Congo basin must be special!}- adapted for cofl'ee

4. The Progress of the Jachson-Harmsworth North Polar Expeditio7i.

                By Arthur Montefiore, F.G.S., F.R.G.S.

After dealing with the objects and methods of the expedition, Mr. Montefiore

flummarised the advantages of Franz Josef Land as the selected base under the

--following heads:                                   (1) Accessibility in any ordinary year                                                                                                                                             (2) northward prolonga-

depots until the 83rd parallel, at least, had been reached.

The second portion of the paper dealt with the progress of the expedition.

Sailing from London on July 11, 189-1, on board the ' Windward,' which had been

purchased by Mr. Harmsworth for arctic work, the expedition arrived at Arkhangel,

where it took on board extra supplies in the way of furs, provender, and Russian

ponies, and whence it sailed on August 5. The ship next called at Habnrova, on

Yugorski Schar, for the Siberian dogs to be employed in sledging. Jiom this

point all definite information had, until a few days previously, ceased. But well

credited tidings came from the walrus hunters in Barents Sea, stating that the
' Windward ' had been sighted in the ice about the middle of August, and again

towards the end of that month, steaming up an open lead.

The third portion of the paper described the events of the year which had come

and gone since any news had been received. The arrival of the steam yacht
' Windward ' at Vardo on September 10, 1895, had enabled the author to give the
members of the British Association a short resume of the doings of the expedition.

It appeared, then, that the ' Windward ' safely made the south coast of Franz

Josef Land on September 7 ; that on the 10th the heavy labour of discharging the

cargo  was     begun                                                                                         and  tliat  on  the  \'2x\\  the  ship                was frozen in for the winter.
                                                  ;

This, however, did not prevent the successful landing of the immense quantity of

stores and general equijiment, nor the erection of Russian loghouses, folding sheds,

observatory, stables, kennels, &c.

During the winter, throughout which scientific observations were regularly

made, Mr. Jackson and his colleagues shot no fewer than sixty polar bears for the

sustenai3ce of the part}% Fresh meat was considered essential to their well-being

and as a preventive of scurvy.

The sun returned February 23, 1895, and on March 10 Mr. Jackson began his
760 REPORT--1895.

northward journey. He made two double marches with sledges well laden and

established a depot 81° 20' N. Returning to his base for more provisions, he found

that the crew, who had wintered on the ship, had been attacked with scurvy. He

did everything that could be done and got the ship under weigh on her homeward

journey by July 3. When the ship left, Mr. Jackson was about to make a third

march inland, and on this occasion he intended to utilise his boats.

The return journey of the 'Windward' was a marvellous instance of arctic

navigation. For sixty-five days she battled with the heavy floe-ice, and, having

consumed nearly all her coals, anything combustible on board was resorted to. The

constant labour and exposure told heavily on the crew, whose behaviour was

-- --above praise. At last with the loss of three men she broke out of the ice on

September 6, and safely made the port of Vardo on the 10th.

Thus it will be seen that all the expectations aroused on behalf of the expedi-

tion had, up to date, been fulfilled.  Franz Josef Laud had been successfully made
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

fresh food had been plentiful ;  the base was secure                                                                                              advance northward had been

easy and depots were already in existence as far as 81° 20' ; and, finally, the ex-

ploring party, with Mr. Jackson at their head, were in sound health and the best

spirits.

   6. The Port of the Upper Nile in relation to the Highways of Foreign

              Trade. By James Turnbull Playfair Heatley.

    To introduce his paper and indicate its aim, Mr. Heatley cites the views of
Sir Charles Wilson from his address at Bath in IStSB on the higher aims of the

Science of Commercial Geography.

    He proposes the introduction of the term ' nodality ' for a commercial centre

on a through line of trade, in accordance with a suggestion of Mr. Maekinder's in

1889.

    He then discusses the relative merits of Alexandria, Sawfikin (with Sheikh

Barud), Massawa, Mombasa, Tanga, and Cliinde, as ports with their respective
trade routes, and states the case for Akik.

    He shows that the Port of Akik is on the best bay of the Red Sea, and
that a line of railway from Akik to Khartum by way of Goz Rejeb is the best

route to bring Khartum and the Upper Kile into commercial relations with
the maritime highways of trade. As the merits of difl'erent routes are decided
by the importance of the nodalities whicli feed the highway of trade, he
points out that the trade of the Ilabab and the Hagar districts will come to
Akik. The important district of Tokar has been described as the granary of the
Eastern Sudan, and is recognised as its key strategically. Here will also come

the trade of the Beni Amr tribes from the valleys of the Anseba and the Baraka.

At Filik there is the fertile district of the Gash. From Filik a line of some 50

miles to Kasala will tap the provinces of Taka, Gadarif, Galabat, and Senaar.

    He points out that as soon as the line is made to Goz Rejeb, the Port of Akik

is in direct communication with the Upper Nile from June to September, during
which time the Atbara and the Nile at the Sixth Cataract are navigable.

     From Akik to Goz Rejeb the distance is from 260 to 280 miles ; the highest
part of it is l,Go0 feet, with easy grading and no diihculties. To Goz Rejeb as a
nodality, where routes meet from all parts, the trade of the Upper Nile, of
Darfur and Dongola, can come by ship and caravan. But the importance com-
mercially and strategically of Khartum demands the line from Goz Rejeb, a
distance of some 180 miles.

     From Khartum the Nile, with some of its tributaries, is navigable for some
1,500 to 1,700 miles. The Blue Nile is navigable for 350 miles; the Sobat for
150 to 300 miles ; the Bahr el Ghazal for 400 miles ; the Bahr el Arab for 500

-- --miles. The Nile itself the Bahi- el Abyad and the Bahr el Jebel is navigable

from Khartum to Kiri, a distance of 1,068 miles.
     From Kiri, which is a tine district, aud its Nile port, an important nodality, a

line of some 50 miles to the mouth of the I'nyama will bring the trade by ship
from the lands in the basin of the Bahr el Jebel, the Victoria Nile, the Albert

Lake, and the Albert Nile.

    From the mouth of the Unyama a line will be made up tlie valley for some

50 miles to Fatiko, which is a fine district, and from Fatiko to Fauvera, some 70
to 80 miles, whence the Victoria Nile is navigable to Urondogani, some 160 to 180

miles.

     Thus there is a feasible highway of trade from Usoga, Unyoro, and Uganda,

--and most of Kitara to Akik, as the Port of the Upper Nile.

7. Exploration in the Jajoanese Alps, 1891-94. By the Rev. Waltkr

                                     Weston, M.A., F.R.G.S.

The two chief mountain systems of Japan, running nortb-east and south-west

respectiveh', meet in the centre of Hondo (the main island). Here, where the

country attains its greatest width, the peaks rise to the loftiest heights, and
exhibit the grandest characteristics in the range of the ' Japanese Alps.' The
distant view resembles that of the Sierra Nevada of Spain, to which these
mountains correspond in latitude and elevation. The range rises from the Sea

of Japan, about .37° N. latitude, and extends nearly 100 miles southwards,

throwing oil' spurs east and west. Some of the highest peaks are volcanic,

others  are  granite                                     or, as  in  the  case  of Yarigatake, the  highest  (10,500 feet),
                                                      ;

hard brecciated porphyry.

Owing to its position, the chain forms a barrier to the Siberian winds after

their passage over the moist atmosphere of the Japan Sea, aud causes an extra-

ordinary snowfall in the winter, sometimes capable of burying whole villages, on

the west side, whilst the east at the same time is comparatively free from snow.

    No traces of glacial action have been found, but snow lies in summer as low

as 7,000 feet in various places.

Remarkable solfataras are found on some of the volcanic peaks, notably on

Tateyama, in the north.

At the foot of other mountains mineral springs (usually sulphur or chalybeate)

attract the peasantry by their medicinal properties. In some of these baths people

are said to stay for a month at a time, sitting with a heavy stone on the lap to

prevent them from floating in their sleep.

Several remarkable silver and copper mines have been found on the west side

of the range. Near Hirayu, at a height of 7,000 feet, work is carried on all the

year round, the annual output of copper being said to reach 140,000 lb., and that

of .silver 2,-500 lb.

     Hhejlora is remarkable both for variety and extent.

    Alpine plants K,re found near the summits, whilst lower down the flanks of
the chain show many English wild flowers side by side with our favourite orna-

mental plants, in addition to others which are quite strangers to us.
     Magnificent lilies {auratu7n, tigrinum, &c.). Lychnis grandiflora. Hydrangeas,

Iris, &c., give gorgeous colouring to the lower slopes. Stately cypress forests

abound, and on the west side the Japanese yew, celebrated for the beauty of its
red-grained timber, is found, usually, however, as a scattered shrilb. The
mulberry tree is extensively grown on the east and west sides, the silkworm

culture being a very widespread industry.

The /«!ma includes black bears, boars, chamois, badgers, hares (which turn white

in winter), flying squirrels, &c.

The writer has also met with the golden eagle, ptarmigan, black-and-white

crow, and a nightingale with a very sweet full note.

The giant salamander has occasionally been found, especially in the south-

west of the range.

The clear mountain streams abound in trout.

      Altlioiigh travel in these wild regions is vei-y rough, still the people dAvelliug
on the outskirts of the main chain are kind, polite, and hospitable to a degree.

Many of their customs and superstitions are very curious. They hold a strong
iDelief in the power of foxes, loadgers, wasps, &c., to ' possess' human beings, of

which the writer has had odd personal experiences.
     In times of drought strange ceremonies, sometimes accompanied by sacrifices,

are performed on some of the mountain tops with the object of obtaining rain.
    Ontake, an extinct volcano to the south of the range, 10,000 feet high, is. next

to Fujisan, the loftiest sacred mountain in Japan. Pilgrims visit it every summer
to practise a sort of hypnotic trance called hami-orosJn, or · bringing down the
gods.' Through the intervention of a skilled ' medium ' communication is said to

be held with the .spirits of departed heroes, &c. Oracular replies are given to
questions dealing with the prospects of future health, business, weather, \-c. It is
a fast dying-out survival of a curious l"\ar P^astern presentment of the Delphic

Oracle.

     The following Report and Papers were read :

     1. Report on Explorations in South Arabia. See Reports, p. 491.

                            2. Formosa. By John Dodd.

     This paper gives an account of observations and explorations in the island of
Formosa made by the author during his residence there from 1864 to 1890. After
referring to the work of British naval officers, consular officers, commissioners of
Chinese customs, and others, and giving a general geographical description of the
island and its commerce, the paper goes on to discuss the probable origin of the
aboriginal tril)es occupying the highest mountain districts. The mode of life of

--the savage inhabitants is described their dress, weapons, methods of hunting, mar-
--riage customs, &c. and special reference is made to the practice of head-hunting,

whether indulged in from motives of revenge or as a pastime merely. The paper
next deals with the Pepawbano, or descendants of the savages of the plains, their
spoliation by Chinese immigrants, and the work of the Dutch missionaries amongst
them. In the concluding section the author refers to the colonisation of parts of
Formosa by immigrants from Fokien, and to the Ilakka invasion of the hill dis-
tricts. Some account is given of the opening up of foreign trade, especially in
camphor, coal, and tea, and an estimate is formed of the commercial resources of
Formosa and of the prospects of their development.

3. Russian Possessions in Central Asia. Bij Dr. A. Markoff.

A comprehensive survey of Russia's Central Asian possessions is a task of great

difficulty for anyone who is not a Russian, on account of the Russian language.

An attempt is here made to give reliable data for a geographical description of this

part of the world, where the three largest empires meet.

acquired by tlie State, all freights and traffic rates generally reduced. Means of

communication are increased and improved. Prospects for English trade in Central
Asia and Russia were discussed. English-made goods enjoy a reputation in Russia

of heing superior to those of French and German manufacturers. English commerce
has not hitherto had a fair share of the plums in Russia's commercial pie. No
reason to be seen why English houses sliould not share in the markets where
French and German commerce finds such ready outlets.

    4. The Towns of Northern Mongolia. By Dr. A. Maekoff.

Mongolia, and especially its inner life, have hitherto not been properly studied.

Travellers mostly confine themselves to noting only that which strikes the eye.

I.  Urga and its monasteries, divided  into three parts, are described                                                                                                                          (1)  the

monastery, (2) Gandan (temples and residence of Buddhist students), and (3)

Maimachen (merchants town). Bogdo Ula, the ' holy mountain,' stands to the

south of Urga. The author described the Mongol veneration for the ' holy moun-

tain ' ; no capital punishment is allowed to take place within sight of it ; it is the

reputed birthplace of Chinghiz Khan, to whom yearly sacrifice is made at the foot

of the mountain. The author mentioned the piety of the Mongols and their belief

that gifts to monasteries secure reward in after life. Richness of monasteries is a

consequence of this belief. Description of temples: (1) The Duchin golobyin
Sume ; its gold cupola hung witli innumerable silver bells, which are always ring-

ing. It is inaccessible to non-Buddhists. (2) The Barun orgo (chapel of Abalai
Khan), less a temple than a museum, with its ancient relics, including an old throne

with figures thereon representing former Mongol heroes, (u) The Maidari temple,

largest of all, which, besides its great idol, contains idols of 10,000 Buddhas made

in 1799. Description of Urga market-place and its trade the insanitary condition

watering the streets; the Chinese quarters, their house*, occupations, and the

immorality of the inhabitants.

II. Ulejasiitai, second largest town in North Mongolia and seat of Government-

General. Soldiers main population ; tradesmen all Chinese. Labourer's hire 71.
per annum, including food but not clothing. Very picturesque neighbourhood.

III. Kohdo. Descriptio!! of prison ; cruel treatment of prisoners ; minor

offenders allowed to walk into town occasionally, when they have a board affixed

to them to show they are prisoners. Town remarkable for cleanliness. Trade is

in the hands of Chinese.

5. Notes on the Topography of Caria. By W. R. Patok and J. L. Myres.

    A series of short journeys in the neighbourhood of Mylasa, Keramos and

Halikarnassos result in a number of corrections of the physical features : especially
a considerable extension N. W. of the basin of the Kartal ddre, which issues at
Keramos ; it has a common watershed with the China Chai, which joins the
 Mseander near Aidin.

     The geology of the district determines its physical feature ; the limestone
plateau is drained partly by swallow-holes from enclosed basins, partly by deep
ravines ; beneath the limestone crystalline rocks are upheaved in two parallel
N.W.-S.E. anticliuals, one forming the range of Latmos, the other exteudiug from
the root of the peninsula of Knidos, through that of Myndos, and as far as Patmos.
About Myndos and in Kos was a volcanic area, active both before and after the

deposition of the cretaceous limestones.

     Remains of ancient Carian and Lelegian civilisation have been examined, and

--the following ancient sites have been identified and verified : Pedasa, one at

Karajahissar, one near Bites (Ghiuk Chalar) ; Kindya at Utch-bounar ; Telmessos,
two towns and the oracular temple on the Kara Dagh Karyanda at Ghiol

--764 REPORT 1895.

      Section F.--ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

                  President of the Section--L. L. Price, M.A., F.S.S.

                           THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12.

     The President delivered the foUowing Address :

At the Oxford meeting of the British Association a report was presented on the

' Methods of Economic Training in this and otlier Countries,' ' the general coonmclu-
sion of which pointed to a deficiency in this country in the organisation of
instruction and the recognition given by the examinations of the Universities,
of the public service, and the legal profession. In the spring of the present
year Mr. Goschen, presiding at a dinner of the Economic Association, commented -

on the inopportune contempt of the practical man for economic reasoning at a time
when many of the questions engaging public attention were economic in character.
The phenomena thus noted may be connected, and a disregard of economic
reasoning explained by a lack of systematic economic instruction. At any rate,

the rnembers of this Section will scarcely feel more certain of the fact that the
questions of the day are largely economic in character than of the illumination

obtained by an acquaintance with Economic Science and Statistics. They mav not

succeed in winning the attention of the practical man, but they are not unl'ikely
to find solace in the flattering conviction that the loss is on his side, and not on
their own. The proceedings of the Section in this and in previous years will

prove beyond dispute that, whether or not the practical man troubles himself to

ascertain or to follow the opinion of the professors, the professors are not seldom
busy in the consideration of the practical questions of the day.

     I make this assertion with the more boldness because "it requires no extra-
ordinary keenness of vision to detect signs in the practical man of a disposition

hardly consistent with the scorn he is prone to bestow. I believe that, in spite of

what we may regard as his worse impulses, he manifests a growing inclination to

seek counsel-- and even imperatively to demand guidance--on social and political
problems from economic professors. I do not know how otherwise to explain
the fact that a well-known firm of London publishers has issued, and, I imagine,
found it profitable to issue, a series of books on social subjects which now numbers

upwards of eighty volumes. Many of these books may not be scientific in

character, but so large an issue, taken in conjunction with other significant cir-
cumstances, such as the recent revival of a desire for economic lectures on the
part of the clients of University Extension, does afford some presumption in
favour of a fresh growth of popular interest. Indeed, I have heard more than

one practical man complain, not that it was unreasonable to look for guidance in

economic matters from economic experts, but that, with every disposition to
hear the advice of professors, it was impossible to obtain it. This complaint

may or may not be founded on reality; but the professors may be pardoned

                      TRAXSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                               7G5

if tliey regard it as a sign of a more wliolesome condition of mind. The com-

plaint may be due to the fact that the guidance sought is not such as the

professors can offer, and that the advice, whicli they are able and ready to give, is

considered inadequate or supertluous.

I am going to address myself to the audacious task of endeavouring to indicate

by actual example the guidance which the economic professor may furnish to the

practical man on the  questions of  the  day                      and I have  prefaced my attempt with
                                                               ;

these observations to show that I am aware of the hazard and difficulty attendant.

Were I to seek for an appropriate metaphor to describe my venture, t might find

it by saying that I was about to disturb a hornets' nest ; and, if I am fortunate

enough to escape with the scornful neglect of the practical man, I am afraid that

the professor may be less compassionate, and that his sting may prove as venomous.

I may, perhaps, plead in excuse that it is at once the traditional privilege and the

inherited duty of occujiants of presidential chairs to devote their observations

especially to that part of their science with which they have been most closely

connected. I have certainly endeavoured on the one hand to bestow a consider-

iible portion of my time on the scientific study of economics as expounded in
systematic treatises, and, on the other, my occupation as College Treasurer has
forced me into intimate contact with the hard facts of at least one department of

practical life, I would not for one moment claim that this dual experience gives
me any title to speak with authority on the relations of economic science to

practical affairs ; but it has determined the grooves in which my tboughts have

mainly run, and, so far as I may presume to a special acquaintance with any

department of economic speculation, it is with that whicli concerns the bearing of

theory on practice. Without unbecoming arrogance, I may, perhaps, think that I

possess in not very disproportionate measure the failings of the practical man and

the academic professor ; and in this capacity I undertake the task before me.

Before considering some particular questions of the day we may determine the

general character of the guidance offered by economics in matters of practice. I

believe that in this connection economists must disclaim a pretension to strict

neutrality. Much, no doubt, may be urged in support of the claim, and consider-

able advantages might follow from its successful establishment. The cool

examination of heated questions in the dry light of science might seem the

appropriate occupation of the academic professor. From the serene heights of

tranquil speculation he might complacently look down on the heat and turmoil of

affairs, and, standing apart from the conflict himself, refuse to assist any combatant.

But the strict maintenance of this attitude is a * counsel of perfection ' and a

practical impossibility. The student must be more or less than human who,

dealing with a department of knowledge so intimately related to the welfare of

humiinity, can avoid, as the result of his scientiiic inquiry, forming a favourable

view of one coui-se of conduct and an adverse opinion of another, and endeavouring

to promote the former, and to hinder the latter, both by advice and by act. He

cannot be content to observe the connection of cause and effect without trying to

set in motion the cause or to restrain its action. He cannot acquiesce* in the

speculative solution of a problem without being impelled to embody his theory in

practice. He cannot contemplate the misery due to bad economic arrangements

without seeking to devise and apply a remedy ; and, viewing the matter histori-

cally, the practical object of benefiting their fellow-creatures has been at least as

powerful a motive with great economic thinkers as the speculative aim of

enlarging the boundaries of knowledge. They have been reproached for hardness

of heart and dulness of imagination, and the popular account is prone to regard
them as dry and unfeeling ; but the description is a travesty of the facts, and their

errors have probably been due as often to excess as to lack of enthusiasm. The

recurring contrast of wealth and poverty, of careless ease and careworn want, of

lavish indulgence and narrow penury, has awakened as responsive a chord in their

hearts as in that of the most .ardent and generous socialist ; and it is impossible to

run over the conspicuous names on the roll of economic worthies without being

impressed by the warmth of their zeal for social reform, and the intensity and

persistence of their anxiety to remove or mitigate human suffering. The 'economic

766 REPORT--1895.

man' of popular description, whether or not he occupy a place in economic theory,

is no portrait of the economist of actual historical fact. The name of ' dismal
science,' so often misapplied, was suggested not so much by the suppression of

human interest as by the apparent destruction of cherished hopes. The science

was ' dismal,' not, as popular usage interprets the phrase, because it was dry and

uninteresting, but because it seemed to counsel despair ; and even then the title

partook of caricature.

Nor do I think that in this connection an attitude of strict neutrality is desirable,

if it be possible. The besetting sin of the academic temper is indecision, and

Anfew errors are more mischievous in practical affairs.   obstinate regard for

neutrality may easily beget indecision, and from that moment the economist

becomes ineffectual for practice. I must confess to the belief tliat the practical

man has a right to demand an opinion on economic points from the academic

professor, and that the professor has a claim to take part in the guidance of

economic affairs which is derived from his scientific study. Pie is an expert, and

Heit is no less his duty than his privilege to discharge an expert's functions.
cannot, as it seems to me, properlj- evade the one or abnegate the other. He may
be careful in forming his judgment. He may conscientiously endeavour to assign
its due weight to every circumstance. He may remember and insist that in many

practical problems other aspects besides the economic must be considered. But the

economic is often of great, and sometimes of par:imount, importance ; and on this

he cannot disown the responsibility of making up his mind without, as it seems to
me, forfeiting his own self-respect and his nsefulness to others. From that

moment his neutrality vanishes. He may, and probably will, incur an opprobrium

which he might have avoided by a refusal to adopt a decisive opinion. He may

sacrifice a quiet and ease wJiich he might have retained. But, whether our aim be

the correct conduct of affairs or the due recognition of economic science, I cannot

doubt that he has chosen the better part. To insist on a strict neutrality for

economists in matters of practice seems to me idle and misleading. It is idle,

because the economist is human, and economics is concerned with some of the

most important interests of human welfare. It is misleading, because it is the duty

of the economic expert to offer guidance on economic points, and there are at all

times few practical questions which do not present an economic side. Certainly

at the present juncture, when the pressing problems of the hour are in many cases

distinctly and admittedly economic in character, to attempt a divorce between

theory and practice is especially inopportune. It is an impossible endeavour to

saw a man into separate quantities ; and I would claim for the appropriate

description of every great economist the epitaph on the tomb of the German

Wesocialist, ' Ferdinand Lassalle, thinker and fighter.'  need not abandon the

thought, but it should stimulate, and not paralyse, the action; for the one is not

fully complete until it is realised in the other. Economics is indeed a science, and

on that ground claims a recognised place in the programme of this Association

but it is essentially, as I think, an applied, and not a pure, science, and the
economist has only fulfilled part of his mission when he has solved a speculative

problem. I am aware that this contention may not be admitted by many academic

professors and practical men, but I believe that it is in accord with historical

tradition, and admits of logical justification.

Yet, if an attitude of strict neutrality be impossible and ineffective, the opposite

extreme of dogmatic assertion is as undesirable as it is dangerous. The older

economists have been often charged with an error of this nature ; and it cannot be
denied that the accusation rests on a basis of truth, though it has sometimes been

couched in exaggerated form. Certainly the modern economist is inclined to state

his opinion with less assurance ; and for that very reason he has lost some of his

iniluence on practical affairs. For the practical man has a sneaking affection, and

even respect, for dogmatic assertion. At any rate, he desires a plain, direct, and

concise answer to his questions, and it is not easy to distinguish between an avoid-

ance of dogmatism and an appearance of indecision. Nor can it be denied that, as

a discipline of the mind, a study of the more abstract reasonings of some of the

older writers, which generally presented the semblance, and sometimes offered the
                                                                                                                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                                                                                                           767

reality, of a precise, defined, consistent whole, is botli wholesome and stimulating.

Legal authorities now pronounce inadequate Austin's ' Lectures on Jurisprudence,'

but I must confess that 1 look back to in}' first acquaintance with them as an epoch

iu my mental history. I believe that they acted as a tonic and purgative, clearing

away obscurity and stimulating intellectual eil'ort. If T may say so, the effect of
reading such an author as James Mill is not unlikely to be similar in the case of

the young economic student ; and for that reason, were there no other, I should

personally regret the exclusion from a systematic economic course of the study of

some of the more rigidly abstract reasonings of some of the more strict of the older

economists. Such study may be regarded as a propngdeutic, through which the

student should pass                                                                                             and he will lose, and not gain, by its omission.                                                                                               The regimen

may be somewhat severe, and the diet, so {av as the moment is concerned, not very

nutritious                                                but the system                                        is braced and the digestion strengthened.
                                                       ;

The fact, however, is that the more famous of the older economists were them-

selves less abstract and precise than they are represented in common opinion.

They took a keen and constant interest in the practical questions of their time.

Their speculative opinions were largely influenced by the prominent facts of their

day. The acumen of later, and even contemporary, criticism has discovered gaps in

-- --some of their reasonings and inconsistencies which perhaps do them honour iu

some of their arguments. Ilecent economic analysis certainly endeavours to bring
within its range a larger number of facts, to be more explicit iu stating and repeat-

ing the assumptions on which it proceeds, and to be more cautious iu establishing

conclusions and definite in limiting their application. But the change is largely

due to the increasing complexity of tlie facts ; and the difference in the mode of

approaching and method of handling a question is one of degree rather than kind.

The particular problems which confronted the older writers admitted more often

of a plain dogmatic answer ; and, if the deliberations of the later economist be

more comprehensive and protracted, his conclusions need not on that account be

indecisive. Indeed, with the lapse of time, the necessity and advantage of expert
advice have grown more obvious and urgent.

    "VYhat, then, is the general character of that advice ? The answer may seem a
truism, but it is smvly this. As in other departments of study, the mission of the

scientific economist is to discern, and to assist others to recognise, the unseen.

He is not content with a superficial view. He endeavours to penetrate below the

surface of aUairs and discover the invisible forces. He employs telescope and

microscope to bring within the range of vision what is distant or unnoticed. He

ofecouomicsaspart of a scheme of general education seems to consist in inducing a

habit of mind which will not be satisfied with superficial explanation. And it

induces this habit in matters with which men and women are brought into close and

necessary contact in the ordinary routine of everyday life. They may flatter them-

selves that common-sense alone is needed to deal with such matters, and that no

scientific training or aid is required. Economics dispels this subtle and danger-

ous illusion, and furnishes an instrument which at once controls and strengthens
common-sense. Nor is this claim for economics as a discipline of the mind and as

a guide in matters of practical conduct by any means novel. It was put forward

with prominence by Bastiat, whose writing is sometimes regarded as an illustrative

example of the application of orthodox economics to the treatmentof an important

practical question. It has been recently adduced by the Duke of Argyll, who,

dissatisfied with what he considers orthodox economics, attempts to supply its

defects by disclosing the 'Unseen Foundations of Society.' The arguments" and

conclusions of Bastiat may not be accepted, the criticisms of the JDuke may be

refuted, by contemporary economists, who may claim the title of orthodox, if

they desire an epithet which seems to bring as much                                                             opprobrium                                                                                                                                 as  honour                                but

they would certainly agree with the earlier exponent and the later critic, who,

curiously enough, have not a little else in common, in regarding the mission

of economics as an endeavour to see, and to reveal to others, the unseen.

may shed illumination on dark or obscured problems, that it may prove, in Bacon's

language, not merely ludfei-a, hut a]sofn'cfifera, may, I think, be shown by a brief

consideration of some typical questions of the day.

WeI. Few are more prominent than that of industi'ial strife.         deplore its occur-

rence, and are read}^ to welcome any promising means su<fgested for mitigation or

prevention. Nor does popular opinion refuse to economics a voice in the matter

but, on the contrary, its authority is continually invoked. AVhat, then, in accord-

ance with the principles we have sought to establish, is the guidance which it can
ofter ? Are there any common beliefs which it may show to be superficially
founded? Few assertions certainly are more frequent than that the interests of

employers and employed are harmonious, and that disputes involve a disturbance

of this fundamental harmony. On the other hand, few facts are more obvious than

that employer and employed i-egard their interests as essentially antagonistic, and
from this antagonism the disputes have arisen. Economics is able to show that

either view  expresses  a  portion,  and  only  a  portion,  of the  truth                             and, by the
                                                                                                    ;

systematic mould in which its reasoning is cast, it brings into clear relief the rela-

tion of the complementary truths.

In the production of wealth the interests of the parties harmonise, for, with

the modern organisation of industry they require the services of one another,

and, the more efficient they respectively are, the larger is likely to be the wealth
produced. It is the interest of the employer that the wages earned by the men

should be adequate to maintain, and, if possible, to increase, their efficiency ; and it

is the interest of the employed that the profits of the entrepreneur should eucour-

--age enterprise and induce a sufficient supply of capital. For production and this

--is a point which economics, and economics alone, can duly emphasise is the ulti-

mate source of the wealth distributed. The larger the amount produced, the larger,

C(eterk paribus, is likely to be the share of either party in distribution ; and in any
event it is certain that a decreased production must issue in effects on distribution,
the burden of which will fall, though in varying measure, on either party. The

influence thus exerted on distribution by production is one which workmen seem
especially likely to forget, and many of the common arofuments in favour of ' making

work,' or providing ' employment for the unemployed,' proceed from ignorance or

neglect of this consideration.

    On the other hand, it may be urged that employers are not very keen to recog-

nise the influence, whether for advantage or drawback, of distribution on pro-

duction. No doubt the division of economics into separate departments tends to

Wemake even the student forget their mutual connection.              do not remember

constantly that production and distribution are simultaneous, and are only dis-

tinguished for purposes of convenient analysis. Yet one of the most important

advances of recent economics consists in the emphasis given to the influence of

distribution on production; and we see more clearly than our predecessors how
the poverty of the poor, by begetting inefficiency, may cause their poverty, and
high wages may imply, not a high, but a low, cost of production. Either of these

truths may be puslied to excess ; but they are certainly fraught with important

consequences, and have an intimate bearing on the question before us. But, like

the influence of production on distribution, the telescope of the economist is needed

to bring and retain tliem within tlie range of ordinary vision.

The full and constant recognition of these truths conduces to a more compre-

Wehensive conception of the possible results of industrial disputes.                                   can see, on

the one hand, that a victory for the moment may not prevent defeat in the long
run, and that loss, which is obvious at tlie time, may issue in ultimate gain. When

we remember that to discern these distant results the naked eve of the plain ob-

server seems incompetent without the aid of the economic organon, we are as ready

to recognise the likelihood of industrial conflict as we are anxious to devise the

means of preventing it. For in the distribution of wealth the apparent interests of
the two parties are antagonistic, and, given the amount produced, the larger
the share of the one, tlie less will be that of the other. The frank recognition of

this possible antagonism is the first step towards the prevention of its natural

consequences. The imminence of the possibility supplies the strongest motive for
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                             769

removiDg unnecessary hindrance, ani furnisliinof likely assistance, to a pacific
flg-reement. And, whatever the final consequences of a dispute to the interests oi
eitlier party, the existence of friction and irritation is beyond question an injury
and hindrance to production. The loss thus occasioned is immediate as well as

distant, and may be considerable; but, if the telescope of the economist is gene-

rally needed to bring sulhciently close the ultimate effects of industrial disputes,
his microscope is sometimes required to magnify the results of friction to dimen-

sions which will attract and retain tlie attention of the oidinary observer. By

discovering these deeper considerations beneath the superficial appearance of

affairs economics may furnish useful guidance iu tlie prevention and adjustment

of industrial disputes.

For to what conclusion do these considerations lead ? To the discovery of

some machinery which may prove not unacceptable, and yet, by imposing delay on

the outbreak of strife, may allow the two parties to hear what either has to urge,

and t3 consider the possible consequences of the action they are proposing to take.

Such a machinery may be discovered in boards of conciliation and courts of arbi-

tration. The fact that both sides should be organised on a sufficiently responsible

basis to send accredited representatives: the fact that, thus meeting one another,

they are compelled to seek and adduce reasons for their own position and to

listen to the arguments in support of their opponents ; the fact that delay and

--deliberation ai"e recognised preliminaries to the commencement of war these facts

may not appear important in themselves, but they oftt;r a chance of pacific adjust-

ment, and afford opportunity for the consideration of ulterior issues. They prevent

the apparent interests of the moment from winning an undisputed victory over the

less obvious interests of the future ; and they do not allow an advantage in distri-

bution to be secured without thought of the efi'ects on production. On the other

hand, the antagonism of interests incident to the distribution of wealth, when the

production is regarded as a given quantity, suggests that the raachineiy may on

occasions break down, and that the arrangements should properly consist of different

stages  and  provide  supplementary  resources                                              for  arbitration  may  succeed  in  ad-
                                                                                         ;

justing a dispute to which conciliation has proved incompetent, and conciliation

may conceivably be useful where arbitration lias been ineffectually tried. Such

antagonism also suggests that voluntary adhesion is likely to be more abiding than

compulsion, and more conducive to the permanent interests of peace, and that to

prevent the occurrence, or reduce the lilielihood, of industrial conflict a traditional

standard of settlement, changed in grave emergencies or serious vicissitudes alone,,

should be established in the trade and recognised as fair.
     For economics, as it seems to me, can do little more than point out those

ultimate and obscure consequences which are concealed by immediate superficial
appearances ; and it is not in possession of a precise principle or rule, which can be-
definitely applied to the determination of industrial disputes. Could it, indeed,
furnish such a rule, the argument in favour of the legal bestowal of compulsory
powers on courts of arbitration and boards of conciliation would gain considerable
strength ; for it must be remembered that the questions before them are not the
interpretation of past contracts, stich as are habitually submitted to the Continental
Conseils de Prud'hommes, but the establishment of agreements for the future, and
it is difficult to force parties to agree when you do not supply a principle of agree-

ment, nor does it on the whole seem likely to conduce to conciliatory relations to

declare that, while you will not compel ma.sters and men to agree, you will
compel them to abide at all hazards by the agreement to which they may come.

For these reasons, tempting as it undoubtedly is to invoke legal compulsion, I believe
that the State can do little more than supply facilities for voluntary agreement

and, exercising, perhaps, some gentle persuasion, leave the pressure of public opinioa
to induce recourse to machinery thus provided. Such I take to be the drift of
competent experienced opinion and the probable scope of effective legislation ; and
such, as it seems to me, is the kind of guidance which economics can offer on this

practical question.

missioners to the Royal Commission it would appear that the county of Suffolk

shares with its neighbour, Essex, an unenvied pre-eminence among districts which

have suffered, and that the present condition of this important industry borders

here on despair. In the actual words of Mr. Wilson Fox, the Assistant-Com-
missioner, agriculture in Suffolk ' is well-nigh strangled.' ' Can economics throw

any light on this lamentable situation? If there is one theory which is sup-

posed to be more remote from fact than another, it is the theory of rent. It

is the fashion, even with professed economists, to regard it as unduly abstract

and, in a recent address - to a learned society connected with this Section by no

distant ties, the President selected the theory as a conspicuous example of older

formulae laid aside. The account of the theory given in that address is open to

question, but the ground of rejection is worthy of note. Lord Farrer, it would

.seem, condemns the theorj- because it is a ' formula useless for practical purposes.'

This criticism raises the question we are now considering; for we are trying to

ascertain the guidance which economic science can furnish in practical affairs.

That it has an important, and, indeed, a necessary, relation to practice we have
asserted in positive terms ; but the relation is not, as we think, that which Lord

Farrer apparently assumes. For economics does not furnish precepts or formulse

immediately applicable to practice ; but it supplies systematised knowledge, the

possession and employment of which will afford assistance in the direction of

practical affairs. The theory of rent is not, then, a maxim of conduct but a

rational explanation of fact. Conceived thus, in my own experience as College

Treasurer, I have been struck by its pertinence, not its inadequacy. It has

certainly seemed to me that, on a broad view, the tenant considers the rent to be

properly that which is left when, on an average of years, he has reaped a fair profit

and paid his labourers the wages they command. The landlord, so far as I have

--been able to discover, occupies in his eyes the position to use language differently
--applied ^ by General Walker of a ' residual claimant' ; and such, also, as I read

the theory, is the place which he fills therein.

Nor is it difficult to interpret part of the present depression in conformity with

the theory of rent. I must take leave to dissent from Lord Farrer when he asserts

that the formula, even in its older shape, paid no regard to situation or to means

of transuort ; and I am disposed to affirm that the emended statement of recent

text-hooks, in which these considerations, with others mentioned by Lord Farrer,

receive explicit recognition, is not so mucli a departure from the older form as a

development and extension of it. But, taking the two points of fertility and

situation alone, it is the agreement, and not the conflict, of what has happened with

what the theory might have led us to expect that is likely to impress. It can

hardly be doubted that one of the most remarkable changes of recent years has

been the development of the means and reduction of the cost of transportation.

This change implies a loss of the advantage derived from proximity to the market in

the case of commodities which admit of conveyance from a distance. Interpreted in

the language of the theory of rent, English land, as respects certain products, has

forfeited part of the natural protection afforded by its situation near to the market.

With the partial loss of this advantage has also disappeared part of another, for

the diminution in the cost of transportation has opened European markets to the

virgin  soils of  America  and other countries                                                                                            and, with regard  to  products  which
                                                                                                                                       ;

admit of convej-ance from a distance, the fertility of English land, whether it be

due to the skill of generations of comparatively high farming or to natural qualities

of soil, has lost part of its advantage. In the language of the theory of rent, the

forfeiture of these two advantages involves depression in the sense of a decrease

of rental ; and, as it seems to me, the adequacy rather than deficiency of the

theory is evident as a rational explanation of fact.

Nor is it useless for practical guidance. The fact which it establishes is a

connection between cause and effect, and not a maxim of conduct ; for the laws of

 economics, like the laws of every science, are, as it has been aptly expressed,

 statements in the indicative and not the imperative mood. But the possession
of the scientific knowledge of the causal connection is more likely than its absence

 to conduce to prudent practice. In the instance before us the conclusion seems
 inevitable that, so far as the depression is due to foreign competition, and the
 vii-ginity of competing soils, and facility of transportation, continued .attention to
products, which must be conveyed to their market quickly, is likely to be more

profitable in an old country like England than the continued production of commo-
dities, which can be raised to greater advantage on newer soils, and be easily

transported from considerable distances. I am aware that this is a hard saying,

 that necessary conditions of cultivation, sometimes neglected, must be taken into

account, and that such a change as is often contemplated in such discussions may
mean a painful and difficult departure from traditional habit, and an apparent

sacrifice of inherited or acquired skill. It is easy to talk glibly of the English
farmer abandoning the cultivation of cereals, at any rate as a staple product, and
turning his attention to vegetable and dairy produce, to fruit-raising and poultry-
rearing and bee-keeping, and the various other modes of making a fortune which

are put forward for his edification. But the lesson of economic theory is plfiin so
far as the depression is due to foreign competition and the maintenance of a Free

Trade policy is assumed,
      I do not discuss the latter question, because it is far too large to be adequately

treated in a paragraph or two, and is excluded from practical politics by the leaders

of political parties ; but it is certainly a que.stion on which economics may reveal the
unseen. Among those invisible facts may perhaps be placed a circumstance often
neglected in popular discussion. In many arguments on agricultural depression

the landed interest is treated as strictly separable from the rest of the community,
and a fall in rent is regarded as the loss to a particular class of an advantage

enjoyed apart from exertion.

     If I may say so in passing, some of the abundant popular use made in recent
years of the conception of rent as an unearned increment seems to me to afford

an example of the misapplication of theory to practice. For in not a few instances

Awhat has happened is this : theory resting on nice distinctions has been crudely

applied to practice, and the distinctions employed to prescribe a definite policy

without regard to their nicety. In other words, the theory has been used as a
precise maxim, which could be straightway embodied in practice, and not as a

scientific conception, the knowledge of which might protect the practical man from

hidden pitfalls.

      In England, at least so far as agricultural land is concerned, the landlord is

usually a partner with the tenant, and, whether or not the system be better than

that of occupying-ownership, it is certain that part of the rent is a return for ex-

penditure, and not a payment for natural qualities of soil or situation ; and to this

extent a fall in rent is likely to operate as a discouragement or preventive of the
fresh and continuous expenditure needed to maintain the land and the buildings in
a state of efficiency. I cannot doubt, in view of evidence given before the Commis-
sion on Agriculture, and of other signs, that the depression must have already
produced deterioration in this I'espect, and thus have injuriously aflected the
economic position of the general community.

     Nor is the landed interest strictly and entirely distinct. In an old country
different classes are connected with one another by ties hard to disentangle, and
impossible to sever without injury or danger. The educational endowments of the

country, as a melancholy personal experience has taught me,' cannot regard agri-
cultural depression with the complacency of disinterested observers. The effect on
certain public institutions, like some of the London hospitals, is notorious ; and it
can scarcely be doubted that, though the prudent management by which they are

characterised may have led many of the great insurance companies to write down

ruary, 1892, and January, 1895.

their landed investments and withdraw from them as they are able, yet they have

been, and are, largely interested in the fortunes of landed property, and perhaps

especially in the rentals of landlords, on tbe security of which they have made

advances. With the stability of the insurance companies is linked tbe preserva-

tion of perhaps the bulk of the savings of the professional classes. In short, in an

old country a strict separation between the interests of different classes is only true

with large deductions.

III. But economics also raises and solves the doubt whether depression in agri-

culture can be attributed to foreign competition alone. It is a significant fact that,

according to authoritative accounts, many of the competitors of the English farmer

have not escaped the distress from which he has suffered ; and in England the

depression, in spite of constant reductions and abatements, has exerted an influence

on profits scarcely less grievous than that on rents. These circumstances certainly

lend weight to the contention that the fall of prices, which is not peculiar, though

perhaps especially discouraging, to agriculture, is parth^ due, to state the matter

in the least controversial shape, to a change in the general relation between the

supplies of gold and the monetary work that it is required to perform. To the

discovery of a cause like this, hidden from superficial view, and to the indication

of the manner in which it may affect the position of agriculture and other indus-

tries, economics, by virtue of its mission to discern the unseen, is peculiarly com-

petent. I do not propose to enter now at any length on the vexed question of the

currency, but it is certainly a prominent practical question of tlie day. It is a

question on which the economist may claim to speak with authority^, and the

practical man may demand, as he maj' be expected to follow, the definitive guidance

of expert opinion. On this question, perhaps, in particular, the unassisted vision of
the naked eye may form erroneous conclusions, and derive no little profit from the

use of the optical instruments provided by the economist.

     I cannot prelaee what I propose to say more appropriately than by a quotation

Afrom Jevons. In that pamphlet on ' Serious Fall in the Value of (iold ' ' Avhich

has attained the rare dignity of an economic classic, commenting on the alarmist

anticipations of Chevalier and Cobden, he remarks that the alteration in the value

of gold consequent on the discoveries in California and Australia would probably

be ' most gradual and gentle.' ' Far from taking place with sudden and painful

starts, flinging the rich headlong to a lower station, and shaking the groundwork

of society, nothing is more insidious, slow, and imperceptible. It is insidious

because we are accustomed to use the standard as invariable, and to measure the

changes of other things by it ; and a rise in the price of any article, when observed,

is naturally attributed to a hundred other causes than the true one. It is slow

because the total accumulations of gold in use are but little increased by the

additions of any one or of several years. It is imperceptible because the slow rise

of prices due to gold depreciation is disturbed by much more sudden and con-

siderable, but temporary, fluctuations which are due to commercial causes, and are

by no means a novelty.' I propose to apply briefly these remarks of Jevons to

some aspects of the controversy which has arisen on the cause of the fall of prices

of the last twenty years.

It is, for example, sometimes asserted that the influence of credit on prices is so

considerable as to reduce to unimportance a decrease in the available supplies of

gold. It may at once be admitted that the modern extensive development of

credit obscures the relation between  the  metal and prices                                                                               but it does not destroy
                                                                                                                                       ;

it, and, according to the view we have been trying to emphasise, the mission of

economics is to remove this veil of obscurity. In this instance it may show that

the relation is not unreal because it is indirect ; that credit, expanding and con-

tracting of itself owing to increasing or diminishing speculative activitj', is yet

limited and controlled in its movements by the changing dimensions in the basis

of cash on which it rests ; and that, through the bank reserves meeting or restricting

the demands for petty cash and permitting an expansion or causing a curtailment

of credit, the supplies of the standard metal exert an important influence on prices.^

Economics may thus furnish a rational account of the modus operandi, and statis-
tics supply corroborative evidence. This evidence, indeed, may be said to amount
to ocular demonstration, for no one who has studied with moderate attention the

course of a curve of general prices over a period of time, drawn io accordance with
the graphic method of statistics, can have failed to distinguish the different

--character of the fluctuations thereby shown to have separated the more obvious

and pronounced fluctuations of credit, marking the flow and ebb of confidence,
from the minor passing changes due to some temporary accident of demand and
supply on the one hand, and, on the other, from the general trend of the curve
indicating a growing abundance or scarcity in the available supplies of the standard
metal. This is a broad influence, the operation of which is only discernible on a
comprehensive view ; but the graphic method of statistics brings it within the

range of ordinary vision, and the reasoning of economics di.scloses the connection
of the phenomena. The influence of credit is apparent on the surface, but the

deeper influence can be detected beneath ; and, if the general level of one credit
cycle be higher or lower than another, the change points to the presence and action
of .some less obvious cause. In a modern commercial society, with its development

of banking and credit, we are able to ob.serve and to measure cause and efl'ect. At
the one end of the ])rocess we possess statistics of the production of gold, and can
frame estiuiates of the amount and character of extraordinary demands.^ At the
other end we can employ, in the form of index-numbers, as they are called,- a

means of measuring changes in general prices, which is certainly adequate to show

the direction of the change, if it is not competent to indicate its precise amount.

For the connection between cause and efl'ect we look to economic reasoning, wliich

here, as elsewhere, enables us to discern the unseen.

   A simihir test may be applied to the adequacy of some other causes. It is

sometimes said that a complete explanation of changes in general prices can be

discovered in the particular circumstances ot individual commodities, witliout any

reference to a common cause. The answer is evident on the principles we have been

endeavouring to establish. Those particular circumstances lie on the surface, and

the common cause is only apparent if we penetrate beneath. Here, again, econo-

mics is aided by statistics. Economics can recognise and explain the operation of

a common cause in enhancing or diminishing the efl'ect of particular circumstances,

and statistics can oft'er corroborative evidence of the presence of such a cause.
For the very meaning and intention of a statistical average is to eliminate the
influence of particular causes, and therefore the testimony of those index-numbers,
in which an attempt is made to exhibit the average change in prices, is adequate to

establish the influence of some common cause, if the basis on which thev^ are con-

structed be sufficiently comprehensive and typical. It can scarcely be doubted tbat
this criterion is satisfied in the case of some of tlie best-known varieties. The

presence of that common cause, it must be reuiembered, does not imply the absence

of other contributory or counteracting causes ; and the inquirer in the region of the
moral and political sciences is always beset by difliculties arising from the plurality

of causes. But, if he can establi-sh the presence of a common cause competent to

produce the efl'ect, and can point to the efl'ect which has been produced, the argu-
ment for the connection between the two attains that higli degree of probability

which is all that we can expect to reach. In the instance before us statistics may
show the presence of this common cause and the occurrence of the efl'ect, and

Weeconomics may indicate the competence of the cause to produce the efl'ect.

in the middle of the century, and we are aware that a series of extraordinary

demaiids ^ had coincided, while various index-numbers are in general agreement in

the stress of the argument may be laid on the extraordinary demands.

--774 REPORT 1895,

exhibitinrc a fall in prices, though the degree of the fall showu in each case may

Tary.^ The economic theory of supply and demand may, then, be used to establish

the connection between cause and etiect ; for, if the supply of a commodity declines

while the demand for it increases, a rise in its value, and a fall in the value of

articles compared with it, become inevitable. Such has been the position of gold

during the last twenty years.

It may be noticed that the possibility of a plurality of causes increases the

likelihood of the action of some common cause ; for, under the conditions, we can-
not expect the apparent effects of this cause to be immediate or universal. The

presence of countei-acting or modifying circumstance, of opposing or contributory

causes, will delay in some cases a process accelerated in others, will minimise here

an effect which is accentuated there. The apparent change due to the cause is

only likely to be general and not universal, to be gradual and not immediate. The

assertion that a fall in prices, if due to an alteration in the available supplies of

the standard metal, should be immediate and universal cannot be sustained when

economics, penetrating beneath superficial appearance, reveals the interaction of

different causes ; and, if the testimony of index-numbers points to a general change,

it is no sufficient answer to affirm that it is not universal. On grounds of eco-

nomic reasoning we should expect a slower movement of retail than of wholesale

prices, of the prices of articles of minor than of those of more general consumption,

of wages than of prices generally.

The mention of wages suggests another point neglected in some current discus-

sions, but brought by economic reasoning from obscurity into prominence. It is

sometimes asserted that the fact that wages have not fallen is a proof that mone-

tary causes have not produced the fall of prices. But, apart from the known tend-

ency of wages to move more slowly than prices, such an assertion oveidooks the

possibility of a simultaneous change in distribution. Economic reasoning points

to the probability of such a change in favour of the wage-earner, and to the effect

that  it would  produce                                         and statistical  evidence  corroborates  that reasoning."  If
                                                             ;

such a change be proceeding, we should expect wages to rise, and the fact that they

are stationary tends to prove, not to disprove, the existence of a monetary cause of

Athe fall of prices.  failure to give explicit recognition to this possibility is due

to neglect of the plurality of causes, and is akin to another argument sometimes

advanced. This maintains that, if it can be shown that the country has pro-

gressed, or not receded, in wealth, in the development of trade and manufacture,

in the prosperity of the mass of the community, it is thereby proved that the fall

of pi'ices has wrougbr no iujurv. But it may be answered that the progress might
have been greater in the absence of the fall, and other forces may have prevented

the cause in question from producing its full effect. Here, again, economic reason

ing may aid in discerning what is invisible to the unassisted eye.
    Few truths, indeed, are slower to receive, and more likely to lose, popular

recognition than those which lay stress on the mutual action of diff"erent causes.

We are told, for instance, that the fall of prices is due to circumstances connected

with improvements in the production and transportation of commodities ; and it

must be admitted that such a common cause is not, like particular causes affecting

individual commodities, eliminated in tlie general average of the index-numbers.

-- --But the one common cause that of improvements in production does not exclude
--the operation of the other that of a change in the available supplies of gold.

Taking a broad view of the whole century, it would certainly seem that the move-

ment of improvement has set steadily in one direction, but that the movement of

prices has first declined, and then advanced, and then declined again. It is pos-

sible that the movement of improvement may have been accelerated and retarded

at different times ; but the change in the movement of prices, which requires ex-

    ' An index-number maj^ be briefi.y described as a mode of showing the average

change in prices by comprising in one grand total the percentages of rise or fall
shown in the recorded prices of certain selected typical commodities.

planation, is not a variation of degree, but a reversal of direction. And this re-

versal coincides with similar changes in the available supplies of the standard
metal. If the disturbances in America at the beginning of the century, with

the known diminution in production, were followed by a fall, if the Califor-

nian and Australian discoveries of the middle of the century were accompanied by
a rise, and if the notorious extraordinary demands since 1873, statistically com-
puted by Sir Robert Giffen,' coming on u supply which until the past few years was
 diminishing, coincided with a fall again, it seems impossible to doubt that, although

 improvements in production and transportation may have been contributory causes,
 an important influence has been exerted by the monetary supplies. With the aid

 of the economic telescope and microscope forces too remote or obscure to be de-
 tected by the naked eye are thus brought within the range of ordinary vision ; and
 the action of the standard metal on prices is one of those forces, for, in Jevons's
 language, it is ' insidious, slow and imperceptible.'

      Such is the guidance which, as it seems to me, economics is able to offer ; and

 in this question of the currency, as in the others of which we have treatsd, it is

 surely not destitute of practical import, for the detection of a monetary cause of
 the fall in prices is so far an argument for the adoption of a monetary remedy.

 Such guidance also, I believe, economics can furnish on many other questions

 coming to the front ; and, in offering this, it cannot be accused of an excessive or

 defective estimate of its claims to popular recognition. I am convinced that, as

 the years elapse, its aid will be sought with increasing urgency, and that it will
 discharge, with a fuller consciousness of its high prerogative, its important but
 difficult mission of seeing for itself, and disclosing to others, the unseen.

The following Papers were read :--

1. Comparison of the Rate of Increase of Wages in the United States and

          in Great Britain, 1860-1891. By A. L. Bowley, M.A.

The basis of the calculation is the vSenate Report on Wholesale Prices, Wages,

and Transportation, 1893, with which is compared the author's estimate of the

change of average wages in the United Kingdom, published in the Journal of the

Royal Statistical Society, June 1895.

On examination it is found that the final wage tables of the Senate Report do

not rest on sufficient data, that no account is taken of the relative importance of

different occupations or of the different levels of wages, and that the figures for

many of the industries included are based on very slender information. The

industries for which the data appear on analysis to be sufficient are selected, and

the average wages in these industries reworked for certain years directly from the

original table of wages. By this means the relative wages for these selected

trades are found, on a method more correct than in the Report, for the years 1860,

1871-3, 1879-80, 1883, 1886, and 1891.

These relative wages are compared individually and collectively with the

corresponding figures already found for the United Kingdom                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        and  it  is  seen that

money wages have followed very much the same course in both countries, rising

to a maximum in 1873, falling till 1880, and then rising till in 1891 the level of

1873 is again reached. Wages in the wool-trade follow a different course, and

do not make much progress in England, whereas in the States they increase

rapidly after 1873.

To estimate the relative change in real wages, it is necessary to find index-

numbers formed on the same plan for both countries. This is done in three ways

Sauerbeck's numbers are first compared with similar numbers for the States;

secondly, they are grouped and weighted, and compared with weighted numbers

given in the Senate Report ; while a third series is found from certain wholesale

prices compiled and grouped in the same Report. After discussion, the second of

bafore the Commission on Agriculture.

these series is chosen ; the relative money wages are corrected by these index-
numbers, and results are deduced from the relative real wages so computed. It
is now found that, in the limited area of industry considered, real wages have
increased continuously in the United Kingdom, till they stand more than seventy
per cent, higher in 1891 than they did in 1860 ; while in the IStates real wages
rose with the same rapidity till 1873, were checked, and finally fell in 1880, and
then rose rapidly till in 1891 they were nearly sixty per cent, higher than in 1860.

     These conclusions must not be taken to represent industry in the States or
in England as a whole, since it has not been possible to include agricultural
wages.

   2. Bimetallism with a Climbing Ratio. By Hexry HiGGS, LL.B.

       FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13.

The following Papers were read :

1. The Normal Course of Prices. By William Smart, M.A., LL.B.

"W hat course may prices be expected to take in a period of normal industrial

activity ? Practical men, seeing that, in one or two well-known trades, reduced

material and freights, improved machinery, centralisation, and gigantic production

sum up a lower cost of production, generalise this, and assume that a steadily

falling level of price is inevitable as the expression of reduced cost.

But, on looking through money price to exchange values, it becomes obvious

that reduced cost takes effect in increase of supply, and that prices come down
only in default of corresponding increase of demand. What is usually forgotten

is that every change in supply means a change in demand, the two being different

aspects and names for the same goods.

(1) Every increase of supply (reduction of price) of any article calls out a

new demand for it, and prevents the fall in price being proportional to the fall in

cost.  The present congestion of capital  and labour conceals this                                                                                                                  because manu-
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

facturers can just now get both at low rates, we unconsciously assume that there

could be indefinite production of any article without increase of cost, (i') Every

increase in the total product of industry is a new demand for goods generally, just

as truly as would be a chance discovery of sovereigns in an old drawer.

   ASuppose Bproducts and products represented the national output. So long as
A Band increased simultaneously and harmoniously, there would be indefinite

increase of both supplies without fall of exchange values. If now the same capital

Aand labour doubled product, while B product remained constant, the exchange
A Bvalue of every would, in terms of B, fall to one half. If subsequently pro-
Aducts experienced the same increase, every would again rise iu terms of B.

Recognising that no two articles have equal elasticity of demand, and that this

subsequent rise of price and its extent cannot be foreseen, the essential fact remains

that every particular increase of supply is increase of general demand. This being

so, reduction of cost, which is the real characteristic of prosperity, will find expres-

sion now in falling price, now in rising price ; the falling price being due to in-

creased supply of the particular article, the rising price being expression of the

increased supply of other articles.

Conclusion : that, so far as the late fall in prices is general, it cannot be due to

causes inside the production process ; and this seems to point to a contraction of

the universal commodity in which all goods (and all costs) are named.

   -- --Corollary : that if manufacture that is, the employment of the masses is to

remain subject to steadily falling prices, the manufacturer will require to find some

new means of paying himself for his work. Otherwise he will find it in specula-

tion or in combination to sustain price artificially.

3. The Gold Standard. By Hon. George Peel.

4 The Menace to EngJhh Industry from the Competition of Silver-using
                             Countries. By R. S. Gundry.

      Although Englaud has had a single gold standard since 181G, all other countries

 continued to use either silver alone or both metals linked together, as full legal tender

money, till 1873. Down to that year, therefore, gold and silver served equally as

 international money. The demonetisation of silver, v^^hich began with Germany's

 adoption of a gold standard, has entailed a gradually increasing divergence in the

relative value of the two metah. The value of gold necessarily rose in response to
increased demand, and the price of all commodities (as measured in gold) fell.
The price of silver fell with the rest, and is now 30f/. an ounce, instead of 60ri., at
which it stood so long as the French mints were open to coin it at the ratio of

 15^ to 1.

     But though silver may appear in Europe to have shared the general fall, the
position is different if we turn to the East. The standard there is silver, and its

purchasing power over commodities has remained approximately stable. To au
Indian, or a Chinaman, or a Japanese, his silver money represents the same value
that it did twenty years ago. The English farmer who wants a sovereign has to

give two sacks of wheat where one used to suffice ; but the Indian ryot who w^auts

a rupee has to give no more of his produce than before, and his rupee will buy in

turn as many of the necessaries of life as it would a generation ago.
     The effect has been to encourage the importation of foreign produce into

England, and to render increasingly difficult the exportation of P^nglish industrial

products to the East.

      It is an error to suppose that the great fall in wheat, for instance, has been

caused by competition in the United States. The American farmer, on the con-
trary, is suffering nearly as we do ourselves. The root of the evil lies in differ-
ences of currency. As a sovereign, which used to be worth only ten rupees, will
now buy eighteen, and each rupee retains its purchasing power, it follows that a
sovereign will buy nearly twice as much Indian wheat, and the price of English
corn had to fall accordingly. The close of the Indian mints disadvantaged India
in turn by lifting her currency above the silver level, and she is being undersold
by Russia.

     The Lancashire manufacturer who wishes to sell his goods in Asia is confronted
by the coiiverse difficulty. As the Chinaman's dollar represents, to him, unchanged

value, he is not disposed to give more silver for his yarn or cloth than before.

But whereas the dollar used to be worth 4s., it is now worth only 2«. Id.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

so that the English manufacturer who used to get, say, {2^ = ) 10s., now
gets 5s. 3f?. The effect has naturally been to check trade. The pro-

portion of total exports of British and Irish produce taken by silver-using

--countries since 1876 when the currency changes had had tiuie to take effect

has been stationary. It was 20-67 per cent, in 1877 and ^OHo per cent, in 1894,
having never been above 2T90 in the interval. The export of cotton yarn from
England to China and Japan is less now than it was in 1876, while the export

from India has enormously increased ; though there has been a falling oft' in her

--case also since the close of her mints (in. 1893) disturbed by imparting a fictitious
--value to the rupee the silver level on which the trade had grown up. The addi-

tional blows dealt to silver and the increasing strain thrown on gold bj' that
measure and the repeal of the Sherman Act disabled the English manufacturer still

further. The gold price of silver fell another \()d. He was obliged to raise the

price of his goods in order to ensure an adequate gold return, and the Chinaman
restricted his demand. The import of cotton goods into China in 1894 was less by

4,000,000 pieces than in 1892.
--778
BEPORT 1895.

     Nor does the harm end here. The conditions which handicap English labour
advantage the Asiatic and encourage him to manufacture for himself.

    As the local value of the Japanese yen, for instance, has not changed, whereas
it has come to represent 2s. only, instead of 4s., to the English manufacturer, the
latter is obviously at an enormous disadvantage in the competition. The result
is that not only is Japan now manufacturing many things which it used to buy from
us but, having satisfied its own requirements, is beginning to export. It is begin-
ning to export cotton goods to China and the Straits at prices with which we can-

not compete. It already supplies Singapore with half the coal used at its wharves,
to the detriment of Wales and Australia. It supplies, not only to China, but to

the Straits, and even to India, numerous minor articles which we used to send when
the dollar represented 4s.. but which we cannot supply for 2s. And what has

been going on in Japan is beginning in China, where cotton mills are being erected

in turn. This competition is only in its infancy ; and we have here the obverse of

the picture of cheap prices upon which advocates of the gold standard love to

dwell. They may be pleasant for the consumer, but how about the producer ?
They may be good for the creditor, but how about the debtor who has to produce
two hundred sacks of wheat to repay the 100/. which he borrowed when it repre-
sented one hundred sacks ? The advantage, to the hypothetical labourer, of being

able to buy a loaf for ^\d. instead of 4^. is obvious, if he retains his former wage;

but how about the man whose wages have been reduced, or wliose occupation has

been lost through the change of arable land to pasture or by the close of a Lan-
cashire mill or a Cornish mine ? If low prices be a supreme good, to be pursued

at the cost of transferring English industries to the East, we have only to per-

severe in the boycott of silver which is ruining agriculture and saddling Lancashire
with a handicap too heavy to be borne. But it is well to realise that all this means

loss of work ; and to the workman who has less wages or no work cheap prices may
seem a questionable boon. The close of the mints against silver has practically

--divided the world into two halves one of which is prospering on a stable and

abundant silver currency, while the West is sufl'ering from financial stress and

fi-om hindrance to its commerce with the East. An agreement to join other

nations in resuming the free coinage of both metals at a fixed ratio would relieve

us from these disabilities by re-establishing parity of exchange, and replace our
farmers and manufacturers on even terms with the rest of the world.

         5. On the Preservation of the National Parochial Registers.
                                  By H. Paton, M.A.

     The early parochial registers of births, marriages and deaths in England and
Wales and in Ireland are still located in the several parishes to which they relate.
This exposes them to the many risks contingent to the numerous and varied
forms and places in which they are kept ; often to the mercy of careless or in-
competent custodians ; and, on account of their being so widely scattered, renders
them practically inaccessible for either statistical or general or special historical
purposes. The valuable information they contain is accordingly almost entirely lost
to the country. This could easily be remedied by the adoption of the method which
has been followed in Scotland. There, by an Act of Parliament, in 1854, the cus-
todians of such parish registers were required to send them to the General Register
House at Edinburgh, where, under the care of the Registrar-General, they have
been carefully gone over, strongly bound, and are now preserved in uniform order
in fire-proof and damp-proof chambers. They are open daily for inspection to

        3. Co-operative liural Banks. By Harold E. Moore, F.S.I.

    At the present time much attention is rightly given to the extension of allot-
ments and small holdings, either as a useful auxiliary, or as a sole means of
livelihood. It is too often forgotten, however, that both skill and the assistance
of adequate capital are necessary if such areas of land are to be made as useful as
possible. Thus, a man may want additional funds before he can purchase a cow,
or other live stock, or plant fruit trees. Even if an individual possesses half the
amount necessary for these purposes, without co-operation he has no means of
obtaining the other half. This difficulty can now be overcome by adopting the
principle of co-operation in any parish in which this additional capital for pro-

ductive purposes is wanted. This co-operation should be applied by the founda-
tion of a society or co-operative bank which would lend to the individual
members, under proper conditions, the sums they require. These conditions would
provide that no loan should be lent except to members of the society, and that in
each case it must be for some specified productive purpose approved by the com-
mittee, and for which securities or sureties approved by them are obtainable.
The funds required by the co-operative bank would be provided from an ordinary
tank, the latter holding the charges given by the individual borrowers, and
having an additional security in the unlimited liability of the members of the
     --

society. Such banlcs had been most successful on the Continent, as would be
shown in the succeeding paper by Mr. Wolff, but in consequence of legislative
difficulties, had only lately been introduced into England. These, however, had
been removed by the action of the Agricultural Banks Association, founded in

1893. Any interested in starting a co-operative bank in the district with which

they are concerned should apply to the Secretary of that Association, Palace
Chambers, Westminster, S.W., for a copy of the rules as approved by the
Registrar appointed under the Friendly Societies Act, 1875.

    4. Co-operation in the Service of Agriculture. By H. W. Wolff.

     Co-operation seems marked out as one of the methods by which help may be

brought to agriculture. The method proposed is not what is usually understood as
* Co-operative Agriculture,' that is, the joint tenure and exploitation of a holding
by a number of men, which does not generally seem to answer, and which promises
no relief to farmers in the ordinary sense of the term ; but co-operation in the

--purchase of farmers' requisites ; in turning farm produce to better account for

instance, milk by means of co-operative dairies ; in practising combined selling,

insurance, the disposal of meat in co-operative butcheries, in common work of
certain kinds, and in the securing of credit by means of co-operative banks.
Instances quoted from home and foreign experience. It was really we who began

co-operative agricultural supply. It did not spread as it should have done,

apparently from want of money. Now the foreigners have outstripped us. The

French agricultural syndicates, started in 1883, have now increased to about 1,500.
They have ' democratised ' the use of feeding stutl's and artificial manures. They
have achieved success on other ground. The Italian syndicates and co-operation
in Germany and Switzerland were then described. The most effective co-
operative method thus far applied has been co-operative credit, which is now
placiug millions at the command of cultivators, large and small, in Germany,
Austria, and in Italy, which is spreading and generally answering very well. The

problem to be solved stated. Credit must be granted for long terms and on security,

which is not now recognised. It must also be nuide available alike for large

farmers and for small cultivators. The credit must be personal. Examples quoted
from abroad. Different systems. That of Schulze Delitzsch, of Luzzatti, of
Eaiffeisen, and their further adaptations. Applicability of the same principle to

England. Village banks for small cultivators, allotment holders, &c. Agricul-
tural banks of a different type for larger farmers. Our difficulties and our

advantages. On the whole there seems room for this form of co-operation, as there
certainly is for the other forms touched upon. There is a want of money among
farmers. The new allotment holders certainly will want such help if they are to
prosper. The legal difficulties have practically been overcome. Our beginnings

seem to warrant expectations of further success.

    The Prohability of a Cessation of tlie Growth of Population in Eng-

                land and Wales before 1951. By Edwin Cannan.

     Everyone knows that the population of a country increases when births and
immigrants exceed deaths and emigrants, and decreases when deaths and emi-
grants exceed births and immigrants, and most people kuow that though emigra-

tion and immigration fluctuate greatly, the effects of migration on the population
of England, as a whole, are small compared with the effects of births and deaths.
But the ordinary citizen does not usually realise the extent to which the deaths of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  781

each decade are dependent on the variations of the number of births in the preced-
ing half-century. Yet this dependence is so well understood that in the Census
Report of 1861 it was predicted that the population over twenty years of age in
1S81 would be 14,167,745, and the Census of 1881 enumerated 13,958,616, so that
the error was onlj' 15 per thousand. Again, in the Census Iteport of 1871 it was pre-
dicted that the population over ten years of age in 1881 would be 19,365,188, and
when the time came 19,306,179 were enumerated. If the same method had been
used in 1881, the population over ten iu 1891 would have been estimated at
22,129,736, and the number enuuun-ated was 22,053,857. In both these last cases
the error is between 3 and 3k per thousand.

     The diagram exhibited shows the basis of these estimates and continues the
series to 1951. The population at each age living at every moment between 1851
and 1891 is indicated by lines sloping downwards, and the gradual progress of
each generation from the birth of its tirst member on the Census morning to its
final extinction by the death of its last survivor more than a hundred years after-
wards, is shown by lines sloping upwards from left to right. From the form of
the figure it will be seen at once that while an immediate cessation of the growth
of population is, in the absence of some great convulsion, altogether out of the
question, a gradual diminution and eventual cessation before the middle of next
century is quite compatible with all reasonable continuitv.

2. Oil the Correlation of the Rate of General Fauperism with the Projwr-

                    tion of Out- Relief given. By G. U. Yule.

     The author had formed two correlation tables for the years 1871-1891, showing
the number of unions in each year, combining given rates of pauperism with given
proportions of out-relief. The result showed that the rate of pauperism was
indubitably correlated with the proportion of out-relief given, high values in the
former corresponding to high values iu the latter (on the average). As this was
in flat contradiction to a conclusion of Mr. Charles Booth's,^ an investigation and
critique of his methods were also given.

                Section G.--MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

      --President of the Section Professor L. F. VERNOif Haecotjet,

                                                  M.A., M.Inst.C.E.

                           THUJISBAY, SEPTEMBER 12.

     The President delivered the following Address :

                            The Relation of Engineering to Science.

The selection of a subject for an inaiifrural address, necessitated by the honour
conferred upon me of presiding over this Section, has been rendered peculiarly-

difficult, both on account of the numerous able addresses delivered in past years by

my eminent predecessors in this ottice, and also by the circumstance that the
branches of engineering to which most of my professional life has been devoted

have not as intimate a connection with mechanical science as some others.

GMoreover, whilst former Presidents of Section have frequently dealt, in their

addresses, with the progress of those special branches of engineering in which
they have had most practical experience, such a course, in the present instance,

would have exposed mo to the danger of merely repeating information and

reiterating opinions already recorded in the ' Pi-oceedings of the Institution of Civil
Engineers,' and in other publications, with reference to maritime and hydraulic

engineering. It has, accordingly, appeared to me that the exceptional occasion of
addressing a gathering of scientific persons, and of engineers who testify their

interest in science by attending these meetings, would l)e best utilised by con-
sidering the relation that engineering in general, and maritime and hydraulic
engineering in particular, bear to pure science, and the means by which pi-ogress
in engineering science might be best promoted, and its scope and utility in-

creased.
      In addition to the oft-quoted definition of civil engineering as 'the art of

directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man,'
Thomas Tredgold also defined it, in 1828, as ' that practical application of the
most important principles of natural philosophy which has, in a considerable
degree, realised the anticipations of Bacon and changed the aspect and state of
affairs in the whole world.' If the influence of engineering could be thus de-
scribed in 1828, when railways and steamships were in their infancy, and the
electric telegraph and the various modern applications of electricity and magnetism

had not come into existence, how far more true is it at the present day, when the

various branches of engineering have attained such a marvellous development
Tredgold also realised, at that early date, that the resources of the engineer must
be further directed so as to cope with the injurious forces of nature, such as floods,

storms, and unsanitary conditions, and thus protect men from harm as well as

promote their well-being. Moreover, he foresaw the great capabilities of develop-
ment possessed by engineering, and its dependence on science ; for he stated that

* the real extent to which civil engineering may be applied, is limited only by the

progress of science ; its scope and utility will be increased with every discovery in
philosophy, and its resources with every invention in mechanical or chemical art,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     '

                                                                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   783

since its bounds are unlimited, and equally so must be the researclies of its prO'

feasors.' If the fall sig-nificaiice of these statements maj' be accepted as correct,

engineers mi<rht fairly claim to have a right to say, ' As engineers we are neces-
sarily men of science, and no branch of science is outside our province.' It might,

however, be said that no engineer, with his absorbing professional avocations, would

have the time to acquire even the rudiments of the principal branches of science

with their ever-increasing developments, to the study of each of which the life-

work of many earnest searchers into the secrets of nature is wholly devoted.

Nevertheless, a few branches of science, such as physiology, biology, aiid botany,

appear to be beyond the scope of practical engineering; whilst a moderate

acquaintance with some others might suffice for the needs of the engineer, except

in certain special branches, supplemented as it can readily be by the advice of a

specialist in complicated case.-'.

     Among the branches of science necessary for the engineer, two may be regarded

as of the highest importance, namely, mathematics and physics, upon which the

science   of engineeriiio-                                              mainly depends                                                                                              and  without  an                                                                                                                        adequate  knowledo-e                                                     of
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

these no person should be able at the present day to enter the profession of a^civil

engineer. Other sciences of considerable, though of comparatively minor, import-

ance  to  engineers                                               in    general, are  chemistry, geology, and                                                                                                                                                                                                               meteorology                                                              but each

of these assumes an enhanced value in special branches of engineerino-.

   --Mathematics in Itdat.ion to Enejineering. The pre-eminent importance of

mathematics in relation to engineering may be accepted as fully established ; and a

President of the Institution of Civil Engineers would not now tell a pupil, at their

first interview, that he had done very well without mathematics, a remark made
to me by a justly celebrated engineer over thirty years ago.

     Surveying, which is the handmaid of civil engineering, depends upon the

principles of geometry for its accuracy ; and ordinary triangulation, geodesy, and

the rapid method of surveying and taking levels in rough country, known as

tacheometry, are based on trigonometry and aided by logarithms. Tacheometry,

indeed, though carried out by means of a specially constructed theodolite, may be

regarded as the practical application of the familiar problem in trigonometry of
Afinding the height and distance of an inaccessible tower.

jectile, the forces of impact, and the stoppage of a railway train are dynamical

problems. Hydrostatics and hydrodynamics provide the foundation of hydraulic

engineering ; though, owing to the complicated nature of the flow of water, obser-

vations and experiments have been necessary for obtaining correct formulte of

discharge. Geometrical optics has been employed for determining the forms of

the lenses for giving a parallel direction to the rays proceeding from the lamps of

a lighthouse, in accordance with the principles laid down by Fresnel. The theory

of the tides, the tide tables giving tlie predicted tidal rise at the principal ports,

rolling of ships, the lines for a vessel of least resistance in passing through water,
and the dimensions and form of screw-propellers, to obtain the greatest speed with

a given expenditure of power, have been determined by mathematical considera-

tions aided by experiment. Electrical engineering depends very largely upon

mathematical and physical problems, guided by the results of practical experience

supersede analytical methods for the calculation of stresses, as more rapid in

operation, and less subject to errors, which are also more easily detected in graphic

diagrams. Pure mathematics, in its higher branches, appears to have a less direct

connection with engineering ; but applied mathematics is so largely dependent

upon pure mathematics, that the latter, including the calculus and ditferential

equations, cannot be safely neglected by the engineer, though certain branches, as,

physics, with its very wide scope in its relation to the various properties of matter,

physical instrument adapted by the surveyor for leyelling across land. Evapora-

tion, condensation, and latent heat are of great importance in regard to the

efficiency of steam-engines: and the expansive force of the gases generated or

exploded, the diminution of friction, and the retention of the heat developed are

essential elements in the economical working of heat-engines. Allowance for
expansion by heat and contraction by cold has to be made in all large structures

and detiections due to changes in temperature have to be taken into account. The

temperature, also, which decreases with the elevation above the sea-level, and the

distance from the equator, limits the height to which railways can be carried

without danger of blocking by snow ; whilst the temperature, by increasing about

1° Fahr. with every sixty feet below the surface of the earth, limits the depth at

Avhich tunnels can be driven under high mountain ranges. Congelation of the soil

is employed, as will be explained by Monsieur Gobert, in excavations through

watei-bearing strata.

Compressed air is used by engineers for excluding the water from sub-

aqueous foundations, so that excavations can be made and foundations laid, at

considerable depths below the water-level, with the same certainty as on dry land.

The compression of air, and its subsequent absorption of heat on being liberated

and expanding in a chamber, are employed for refrigerating the chambers in which

meat and other perishable supplies are preserved. Compressed air is employed for

working the boring machinery in driving long tunnels through rock, and provides,

at the same time, means of ventilation ; and it also serves to convey parcels along-
pneumatic underground tubes. Moreover, the compressed-air and vacuum brakes

are the most efficient .systems fif automatic continuous brakes, which have done so

much to promote safety in railway travelling, and in reducing the loss of time in

the pulling up of frequently stopping trains. The production of a more perfect

vacuum than can be produced by the ordinary air-pump, might have been

supposed to be merely an interesting physical result ; ' but, in fact, the preservation

of the heated filament of carbon in the incandescent electric light has been

rendered possible only by the far more perfect vacuum obtained by the Sprengel
vacuum-pump, by which the air is exhausted down to so low a pressure as one-

two hundred milliontli of an atmosphere.

colourinj^ of lifjhts on their visibility is of interest in determining the shades of
colour to be uspd for sijrnals and sbip-ligbts, and also the relative power of the

lights required for didereiit colours to secure equal illuminating power. Distinc-

tions of colour nro essential in these cases; but for distinguishing lighthouses the

use of coloured glasses has been abandoned, on account of their impairing the light
emitted ; and the desired indication has been effected by varying the number and
duration of the tlaslies and eclipses in each lighthouse. The detection of colour-

blindness is of interest to engineers, as this physical inhrmity incapacitates men
from acting as engine-drivers, signalmen, or navigating seamen. The use of com-

pressed (lil-gas enables buoys and beacons to give a warning or guiding light for

about three months without requiring attention ; and the electric light has
accelerated the passage through the Suez Canal from ',]0^ hours to 20 hours, and

has greatly increased the capacity of the Canal for traffic by enabling navigation to

be carried on at night. The electric light also affords an excellent, safe, and cool

light in the confined cabins on board ship, in the headings of long tunnels, and in

the working-chambers filled with compressed air used for sinking subaqueous

foundations.

     Acoustics might se?m to have little relation to engineering ; but the soundness
of the wheels of a train are tested by the noise they give when struck with a

liammer; warning notes are emitted by railway and steamship whistles^ the fog-

horn on board ship, and the whistling and bell buoys employed for marking shoals

or the navigable channel ; whilst the striking of bells, the blast of steam sirens,

and the explosion of compressed gun-cutton cartridges and rockets indicate the

position of lighthouses in foggy weather. The most powerful sounds that can be

produced by the help of steam appear to have a very limited range as compared

with light; for, under ordinary conditions, the most powerful siren ceases to be

audible at a distance of six or seven miles; whilst the transmission of sound is

very much afiected by the wind and the condition of the atmosphere. It seems
possible that loud detonations at short intervals may be more readily heard than

the continuous blast of a steam trumpet.

Electrical engineering is very intimately connected with physics, for it really

is the application of electiicity to industrial purposes. The very close relation

between electricity and magnetism, discovered by Oersted in 1820, and further

established by the remarkable researches of Faraday, has led to the present system

of generating electricity by the relative movement of coiled conductors and

electro-magnets, in dynamo-electric machines worked by a steam-engine or other

motive power. The electrical current thus generated can be transmitted to a

distance with little loss of energy                                                                                                                                                          and  it  can  either be used directly for lighting

intervention of another dynamo. Electricity is also employed for the simultaneous

firing of a series of mines, at a safe distance from the site of the explosion.
    The convertibility of heat and energy, indicated by Mayer, forms the basis of

thermodynamics ; and the mechanical equivalent of heat, a physical problem of the
highest interest, determined by Joule in 1843, furnishes a measure of the amount
of work that can be possibly obtained by a given expenditure of heat in heat-

engines.

    The above summary indicates how the discoveries of physics are applied to
many branches of engineering ; and a knowledge of the laws of physics, and of the

results of physical researches, appears, therefore, essential for the successful prose-

cation of engineering works. The very intimate relation of mechanical science to

mathematics and physics, and the indebtedness of engineers to men of science

outside the ranks of their profession, are, indeed, evidenced by the roll of the

Presidents of Section G, containing the names of Dr. Robinson, Mr. Babbage, Pro-

     The manufacture of iron, steel, and other metals, and the formation of alloys,
are essentially chemical operations ; and the Bessemer and Gilchrist processes, by
which steel is produced in large quantities directly from cast iron, by eliminating
a portion of the carbon contained in it, and also the injurious impurities, silicon
and phosphorus, in place of the former costly and circuitous method of removing
the carbon from cast iron to form wrought iron, and then combining a smaller
proportion of carbon with the wrought iron to form steel, are based on definite
chemical changes, and necessitated chemical knowledge for their development.

      Chemical analysis is needed for determining the purity of a supply of water, or
the nature and extent of its contamination ; and Dr. Clarke's process for softening
hard water, by the addition of lime water, depends upon a chemical reaction. The
methods also of purifying water by filtration, shaliing up with scrap iron, and
aeration, are chemical operations on an extensive scale ; and their efficiency has to
be ascertained by chemical tests.

     Cements and mortars depend for their strength and tenacity, when mixed with
water, upon their chemical composition and the chemical changes which occur.
The value of Portland cement requires to be tested quite as much by a chemical

analysis of its component parts, as by tlie direct tensile strength of its briquettes

for an apparently strong cement may contain the elements of its own disruption, in

a moderate proportion of magnesia or in an excess of lime. The chemical change
which has been found to occur in the Portland cement of very porous concrete
exposed to the percolation of sea-water under considerable pressure, by the substi-
tution of the magnesia in sea-water for the lime in the cement, if proved to
take place even slowly under ordinary circumstances, would render the duration
of the numerous sea works constructed with Portland cement very precarious,
and necessitate the abandonment of this very convenient material by the maritime

engineer.

     Explosives, which have rendered such important services to engineers in the
construction of works through rock and the blasting of reefs under water, as well
as for purposes of attack and defence, form an important branch of chemical
research. The uses of gun-cotton as an explosive agent, though not for guns, have
been greatly extended by the investigations of Sir Frederick Abel, and by the
discovery that it can be detonated, when wet and unconfined, by fulminate of
mercury ; whilst smokeless powder, a more recent chemical discovery, seems
likely, by its application to firearms, to produce important modifications in the
conditions of warfare. The progress achieved by chemists in other forms of
explosives has been marked by their successive introduction for blasting in large
engineering works. Thus the removal of the rock in driving the Mont Cenis
tunnel, in 1857-71, was effected by ordinary blasting powder whilst the excava-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

tion of the longer St. Gothard tunnel, in 1872-82, was accomplished by the more
efficient explosive dynamite.^ Moreover, the first great blast for removing the

portion of Hallett's Reef which obstructed the approach to New York Harbour,

was effected mainly by dynamite, together with vulcan powder and rendrock, in
1876 ; whereas the far larger Flood Rock, in mid-channel, was shattered in 1885

by rackarock, a mixture of potassium chlorate and nitrobenzol, and a much

cheaper and a more efficient explosive under water than dynamite.' Rackarock is
one of the series of safety explosives first investigated by Dr. Sprengel in 1870,
which, consisting of a solid and a liquid, is safely and easily mixed for use ; and
these materials, being harmless previously to their admixture, can be stored in large
quantities without risk.^ The cost also of this large blast was greatly reduced by
the sympathetic explosion of the bulk of the cartridges by the detonation of a
series of primary exploders, placed at intervals along the galleries and fired simul-
taneously by electricity from the shore.

     The utilisation of sewage belongs to agricultural chemistry ; and the deodorisa-

The disposal of sewage by irrigation is a branch of agriculture ; and the innocuous

character of the eflluent tiuid, discharged into the nearest stream or river, has to be
ascertained by chemical analysis. Chemists have the opportunity of benefiting
the community, and at the same time acquiring a fortune, by discovering an
economical and efficient process for converting sewage on a large scale into a

profitable saleable manure, so that inland towns may not have to dispose of their
sewage at a loss, and that towns situated on tidal estuaries or the sea-coast may

no longer discharge their sewage into the sea, but distribute it productively on the

land.

The purifying of the atmosphere from smoke, rendered increasingly expedient

by the growth of population, and the prevention of the dense fogs caused by it, by

some practical method for more thoroughly consuming the solid particles of the

fuel, still await the combined efforts of chemists and engineers.
--AGeology in Relation to Emjineeriwj.
                                         knowledge of the superficial strata of

the earth is important for all underground works, and essential for the success of

mining operations. Geology is indispensable in directing the search for coal, iron

ore, and the various metals ; and the existence of faults or other disturbances may
greatly modify the conditions. The value of geology to the engineer is not, how-

ever, confined to the extraction of minerals, for it extends, more or less, to all

works going below the surface.

The water-supply of a district, in the absence of a suitable river or stream, is

dependent on the configuration and geology of the district ; and the spread of

London before the extension of waterworks, as pointed out by Professor I'restwich,

had to be confined to the limits of the gravel subsoil, in which shallow wells gave

access to the water arrested by the stratum of underlying London clay. The

sinking also of deep wells for a supply of water, and the depth to which they

should be carried, are determined by the nature of the formation, the position of
Afaults, and the situation of the outcrop of the water-bearing stratum.
                                                                         geological

examination, moreover, of a site proposed for a reservoir, to be formed by a

reservoir dam across a vallej-, has to be made to ascertain the absence of fissures

and the soundness of the foundation for the dam.

In the driving of long tunnels, the nature and hardness of the strata and their

dip, the prospects of slips, and the possibility of the influx of large volumes of

water, are geological considerations which affect the designs and the estimates of

cost. The excavations also of large railway cuttings and ship-canals are con-

siderably afiected, both as regards their side slopes and cost, by the nature and

condition of the strata traversed.

  --Meteorology in Relation to Engineering. The maximum pressure that may be

exerted by the wind has to be allowed for in calculating the strains which roofs,

bridges, and other structures are liable to have to bear in exposed situations ; and

continuous records of anenometers for long periods are required for determining

this pressure. The force of the wind also, and the direction, duration, and period

of occurrence of severe gales, are important to the maritime engineer for estimating

the effects of the waves in any special locality, for determining the quarter from

which shelter is needed, and for ascertaining the seasons most suitable for the execU'

tion of harbour works, the repair of damages, and the carrying out of foundations of

lighthouses and beacons on exposed rocks. The harbour engineer must, indeed, of

necessity be somewhat of a meteorologist, for the changes in the wind and weather,

the oscillations of the barometer, and the signs of an approaching storm are indi-

cations to him of approaching danger to his works, which he has to guard against
for the sea is an insidious enemy which soon discovers any weak spot, and may in

a few hours destroy the work of months.

Continuous records of rainfall, as collected regularly by Mr. Symons from nume-

rous stations in the United Kingdom, are extremely valuable to engineers for calcu-

lating the probable average yield of water from a given catchment area, the greatest

and least discharges of a river or stream, the size of drainage channel needed to

secure a low-lying area from floods, and the amount of water available for storage

or irrigation in a hot, arid district. The loss of water by evaporation at different

formation as to the force and extent of these visitations of nature is of value in

enabling engineers to provide more eft'ectually against their ravages.

  --Benefits conferred by Engineering vpo7i Pure Science. Engineering is generally

concerned in the application of the researches of science for the benefit of mankind,

and not in the extension of the domain of pure science, which necessitates greater

concentration of attention and study than the engineer in practice is able to devote

to it. Engineers, however, though never able to repay the ever-increasbg debt of

gratitude which they owe to past and present investigators of science, except in

rendering these abstract researches of practical utility, have, nevertheless, been

able incidentally to promote the progress of science. Thus mechanical science, by

the construction of calculating machines, the planimeter, integrating machines, the

tide-predictor and tidal harmonic analyser of Lord Kelvin, the self-registering tide-

gauge, and various other instruments, has lightened the labours of mathematicians
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

whilst excavations for works, and borings have assisted the investigations of geo-

logists. The mechanical genius of Lord Rosse led mainly to the success of his
gigantic telescope, which has revealed so many secrets of the heavens ; and the

rapidity of locomotion, due to the labours of engineers, has greatly facilitated

astronomical observations and physical discoveries, besides promoting the concourse-

of scientific men and the diffusion of knowledge. Electrical engineering, more-

over, is so closely allied to electrical physics that the development of the one

necessarily promotes the progress of the other. The observations also conducted

by hydraulic and maritime engineers in the course of their practice aid in extend-

--ing the statistics upon which the science of meteorology is based.
     Engineering as an Experimental Science. Engineering, so far as it is based on

mathematics, is an exact science, and the strains due to given loads on a structure

can be accurately determined                                                                                                                                       but the strength of the materials employed                                                                        has  to
                                                                                                                                                                ;

be ascertained before any structure can be properly designed. Accordingly, the

resistance of materials to tension, compression, and flexure, has to be tested, and

their limit of elasticity and breaking weight determined. Thus, pi'eviously to the

construction, by Robert Stephenson, of the Britannia Tubular Bridge, the first

wrought-iron girder bridge of large span erected, numerous experiments on various

forms of wrought iron were carried out by that eminent mathematician and

mechanician Eaton Ilodgkinson, who had previously indicated the proper theore-
tical form for cast-iron girders, and to whom the success of the bridge across the

Menai Straits was in great measure due.' Besides the numerous tests always now
made of the materials employed during the progress of any large engineering work,

railway bridges are also subjected to severe test loads before being opened for public

traffic, by which the safety of the structures and their rigidity, as measured by

the amount of deflection, are ascertained, serving as a guide for subsequent

designs.

Numberless experiments have been made on the flow of water in open channels,

over weirs, through oritices, and along pipes ; and the influences of the nature of
the bed, the slope, depth, and size of channel, have been investigated by various

hydraulicians. Mr. Thomas Stevenson measured the force of waves at some places

on the Scotch coast;- Professor Osborne Reynolds has examined the laws of tidal

flow in a model of the inner estuary of the Mersey, and in specially shaped experi-

mental models ; ^ and I have found it possible, in small working models of the

Mersey and Seine, not merely to reproduce the configuration of the bed of the

estuary out to sea, but also to observe the efl'ects of difterent forms of training

"works in modifying sandy estuaries.'' Mr. "William Froude, after his retirement

ance of ships in water, which have proved of inestimable value to the naval
architect, and which formed the subject of his presidential address to this Section

in 1875.

     Electrical engineering' is specially adapted for experimental investigation and,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

in this branch, theory and practice are so closely allied that some of the irost eminent

exponents of the theory of the subject, such as Lord Kelvin and Dr. Ilopkinson,

have developed their theories into practical results. In most other branches, the

investigator is generally distinct from the engineer in large practice ; but it may

be safely said that an able iniestigator and geueraliser in engineering science, as,

for instance, the late Professor liankine, accomplishes work of more value to the

profession at large than the practical engineer, who, in the world's estimation,

appears the more successful man.

    Every branch of engineering science is more or less capable of being advanced by

experimental investigations ·, and when it is borne in mind that the force of waves,

the ebb and flow of tides in rivers, the influences of training works in estuaries^
and the motion of ships at sea have been subjected to experimental research, it ap-

pears impossible to assign a limit to the range of experiments as a means of extending

engineering knowledge. Problems of considerable interest, which can only be
solved by experiments or by comprehensive generalisations from a number of
examples, must frequently present themselves to engineers in the course of their

practice, as they have to myself; and engineers would render a great service to

the profession if they would follow up the lines of investigation thus suggested to
them, in the true spirit of scientific inquiry.

     Failures of Works due to Neglect of Scientific Considerations.--Before the
amount and distribution of the stresses in structures were thoroughly understood,

a disposition was naturally evinced to err on the side of excessive strength and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

the materials in the various parts of the structure were not suitably proportioned

to the load to be borne, resulting in a waste of materials and too great an expen-

diture ou the works. Thus some of the early high masonry reservoir dams in

Spain exhibit an excessive thickness towards the top, imposing an unnecessary load

on the foundations                                                                          and in many of                                          the earlier iron                                  girder  bridges more                   material

was employed than was required for stability, and it was not properly distributed.

Boldness engendered by increased experience, and dictated by motives of economy,
has tended to make the engineers of the present day pursue an opposite course

and, under these circumstances, the correct calculation of the strains, the exact
strength of the materials, and a strict appreciation of the physical laws affecting the
designs become of the utmost importance.

    The failures of many bridges may be explained by errors in design, defects in

construction, or by economy carried beyond the limits" of safety in pushing forward

railways in undeveloped                                                                     countries                                               but  other  failures                              are     attributable "to               a      dis-
                                                                                                                                                 ;

regard or undejestimation of the influence of physical causes. Thus the Tay Bridge

mdisaster, 1S79, was due to underestimating the amount and effect of the wind-

pressure in an exposed situation, where it acted with a considerable leverage, owing

to the height of the bridge, and was inadequatelyprovidedagainst by the small trans-

Terse width of the piers in proportion to their height, which were further weakened
by bad workmanship in the bracing of their columns. The bursting of the Bouzy

masonry dam in France this year must be attributed to an inadequate thickness

at part of the cross-section, producing a tensional strain on the inner face with the

reservoir full, aided by the instability resulting from a fissured foundation. The

overthrow of the outer arms of the Madras breakwaters, during a cyclone in 1881,

may be traced to an inadequate estimate of the force of the waves in a storm, in deep

water, and with a great fetch across the Indian Ocean, beating against the portions

of the breakwaters directly facing their                                                                                                                 course                                  for  these   outer  portions, running

placed at right angles to the shore and the direction of the waves, and situated for

the most part in shallower water. The erosion of the bed of the Ganges Canal on

the first admission of the water, necessitating the erection of weirs at intervals to

check the current, resulted from an error in the calculated discharge of the channel

with the given inclination, and the consequent undue velocity of the stream, pro-

ducing scour. The failure of the jetty works at the outlet of the Rhone to effect any

permanent deepening of the channel over the bar, was due to the unsuitable direc-

tion given to the outlet channel in view of the physical conditions of the site, and

the concentration of all the discharge, and consequently all the alluvium carried

down, into a single mouth, whereby the rate of deposit in front of this outlet has

been considerably increased. The excessive cost, and consequent stoppage, of the
Panama Canal works, though due to a variety of causes, must be partly attributed

to want of due consideration of the strata to be excavated ; for a cutting of 300
feet in depth, which may be possible in rock, becomes impracticable when a con-

siderable portion has to be executed in very treacherous clay.

Occasionally failures of works may be attributed to exceptional causes or pecu-

liarly unfavourable  conditions                                                             but in most cases, as in the instances                                         given  above,
                                                                                         ;

they are the result of errors or deficiencies in design, which might have been

--avoided by a more correct appreciation of the physical conditions involved.
     Scientific Training of Engineers. In most professions, preliminary training in

those branches of knowledge calculated to fit a student for the exercise of his pro-

fession is considered indispensably necessary ; and examinations to test the pro-

· ficiency of candidates have to be passed as a necessary qualification for admission

into the Army, Navy, Church, Civil Service, and both branches of the law. Special

care is taken in securing an adequate preliminary training in the case of persons to

whom the health of individuals is to be entrusted, not merely by experience in

hospitals, but also by examinations in those branches of science and practice relating

to medicine and surgery, before the medical student can become a qualified practi-

tioner. If so much caution is exercised in protecting individuals from being

attended by doctors possessing insufticient knowledge of the rudiments of their
profession, how much more necessary should it be to ensure that engineers are

similarly qualified, to whom the safety and well-being of the commimity, as well

as large responsibilities in regard to expenditure, are liable to be entrusted ! The
duty of the engineer is to apply the resources of nature and science to the material

henefit and progress of mankind ; and it, therefore, seems irrational that no

guarantee should be provided that persons, before becoming engineers, should acquire
some knowledge of natural laws, and of the principles of those sciences which form

the basis of engineering. The Institution of Civil Engineers has, indeed, of recent

years required some evidence of young men having received a good education before

their admission into the student class ; but some of the examinations accepted as suifi-

cient for studentship, such as a degree in any British university, afibrd no certainty

in themselves that the persons who have passed them possess any of the qualifications

requisite for an engineer : and it is quite unnecessary to become a student of the

Institution in order to become an engineer. The Council of the Institution has no
doubt been hitherto deterred from proposing the estabhshment of an examination

m mathematics and natural science, as a necessary preliminary to becoming an

engineer, by the remembrance that some of the most distinguished engineers of early

days in this country were  self-taught                                                                                              men                               but  since those days engineering  and
                                                                                                                                                                   ;

the sciences upon which it is based have made marvellous advances ; and in view

of these developments, and the excellent theoretical training given to foreign

engineers, it is essential that British engineers, if they desire to retain their present

position in the world, should arrange that the recruits to their profession may be

amply qualified at their entrance in theoretical knowledge, in order to preserve the

standard attained, and to be in a position to achieve further progress. No amount

of preliminary training will, indeed , necessarily secure the success of an engineer^

anymore than the greatest proficiency would be certain to lead the medical student

to renown as  a  physician or surgeon                                                                                               but other conditions being equal, it will greatly

colleagues and the public. The engineers of the past achieved great results in the

then early dawn of engineering knowledge, by sound common sense, a ready grasp

of first principles and of the essential points of a question, capacity for acquiring
knowledge, power of managing men and impressing them witli confidence, and

shrewdness in selecting competent assistants. These same qualities are still needed
                                                                                                                                         them

but far more knowledge of mathematics and other sciences is required now, owing

to the enormous advances effected, if the progress of engineering science is to be

maintained. Even though in some branches engineers in large practice may not

have the time, or retain the requisite facility, for solving intricate mathematical

problems, they should be able readily to comprehend the full bearing of the prin-

ciples presented, and to understand the nature of the solutions put before them,

which nothing but the scientific faculty implanted by early training in mathema-

tics and physics can adequately secure.

   A qualifying examination for engineers would usefully stop persons at the out-

set from entering the profession, who failed to evince the possession of the requisite

preliminary knowledge: it would indicate, by the subjects selected, the kind of
training best calculated to fit a person to become a useful engineer ; and it would
protect^'the public, as far as practicable, from the injuries or waste of money that

might result from the mistakes of ill-qualified engineers.
     Specialising in Engineering.-- Qome branches of engineering have for a long

time been kept distinct from others, such as the construction of steam-engines,
locomotives, and marine engines, ship-building, heavy ordnance, hydraulic
machinery, and other purely mechanical works, one or more of which have been
treated as specialities by certain firms, and also gas lighting, and, more recently,
electric lighting. In the department, however, of civil engineering in its narrower

signification, as distinguished from mechanical engineering, engiueers of former

times were regarded as equally qualified to undertake any of the branches of public

works ; and the same engineer might be entrusted with the execution of roads,

railways, canals,     harbours,     docks,  sewerage  works,   and  waterworks                                                           while  even
                                                                                                                                      ;

steamships were not excluded from the category in Brunei's practice. The engineer
of to-day, indeed, would be lacking that important factor for success, common

sense, if he declined to execute any class of works which he might be asked to

undertake ; and a variety of works is very useful to the engineer in enlarging his
views and experience, as well as in extending the range of his practice. The

tendency, however, now in engineering, as in medicine, is for the engineer's practice

to  be  confined  to  the  special  branch  in which  he  bad  had  most  experience                                                     a      resiilt
                                                                                                                                     ;

which cannot fail to be beneficial to the public, and calculated to promote the

progress of each branch. The powers of the human mind are too limited, and life

is too short, for engineers to be able to acquire, in the present day, equal proficiency
in the theory and practice of the several branches of engineering science, with their
ever-widening scope and development ; and, as in the domain of abstract science,

general progress will be best achieved in engineering science by the concentration

of the energies of engineers in the advancement of their special fine of practice.

   --Value of Co??g7-esses on Special Branches of Engineering. The scope of engi-

neeriug science is extending so fast that it is impossible for the Institution of Civil
Engineers, which, as the parent society, embraces every branch within its range of

subjects, to give more than a very limited time for the consideration and discussion

of papers relating to the non-mechanical branches of the profession comprised in

public works. Mechanical, electrical, and gas engineers have special societies of their

own for advancing their knowledge and publishing their views and experience,

while sharing equally with the other branches in the benefits of the older Institu-

tion. Congresses accordingly afford a valuable opportunity for railway, hydraulic,

and sanitary engineers of expressing their views, and enlarging their experience by
Myconsultation and discussion with engineers of various countries.
                                                                          experience of

the six maritime, inland navigation, and waterworks international congresses I have

attended in England and abroad, has convinced me of the very great value of such

meetings in collecting information, comparing views, and obtaining some knowledge

of foreign works and methods ; whilst the acquaintances formed with some of the

·most celebrated foreign engineers, afford opportunities of gaining further infor-

mation about works abroad, and deriving experience from their progress and

results.

  --Engineering Literature. Lawyers have been defined as persons who do not

possess a knowledge of law, but who know where to find the law which they may
require. It may be hoped that a similar definition is not applicable to engineers ; but

with the rapid increase of engineering literature, it is most desirable that engineers

should be able readily to refer to the information on any special subject, or descrip-

tions of any executed works, which may have been published. Much valuable

miitter, however, is buried in the proceedings of engineering and scientific societies,
and in various publications ; and often a considerable amount of time is expended in

fruitless search. This great waste of time and energy, and the loss of available

information involved, led me a few years ago to suggest that a catalogue of engi-

neering literature ought to be made, arranging the lists of publications relating to

the several branches under separate headings. There is a possibility that this

arduous and costly task may be       partially accomplished                                                                                  in separate volumes                                                                              and,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

at any rate, the first step has been effected by the publication, under the auspices

of the Paris Inland Navigation Congress of 1892, of a catalogue of the publications
Aon inland navigation.
                        start has also been made in France, Italy, and England,

towards the prepai'ation of a similar catalogue on maritime works, which it may

be hoped means will one day be found to publish on the meeting of some future
congress. Engineers who have searched, even in the best libraries, for the pub-

lished information on any special subject, will appreciate what a great boon an

engineering subject catalogue would be to the profession, and indirectly to the

public at large.

The occasional publication of comprehensive books on special branches of engi-

neering, and concise papers on special subjects, by competent authorities, are
extremely valuable in advancing and systematising engineering knowledge ; but
the lime and trouble involved in the preparation of such publications must, like

the organising of congresses, be regarded as a duty performed in the interests of

the profession and science, and not as affording a prospect of any pecuniary

benefit.

   --Concluding Remarks. In this address, I have endeavoured, though very imper-

fectly, to indicate how engineering consists in the application of natural laws and

the researches of science for the benefit and advancement of mankind, and to point
out that increased knowledge will be constantly needed to keep pace with, and to
carry on, the progress that has been made. The great advantages provided by

engineering works in facilitating communications and intercourse, and consequently

the diflfusion of knowledge, in increasing trade, in extending civilisation to remote

regions, in multiplying the comforts of life, and aflfording enlarged possibilities of

enjoyment and change of scene, may be regarded as amply acknowledged ; but the
more gradual and less obvious, though not less important, benefits effected by

engineering works are not so fully realised.

   A comparison of engineering with the other chief branch of applied science,

medicine, exhibits .some similarities and differences. In both professions, the dis-

coveries of science are utilised on  behalf of mankind                                                                                       but whilst physicians devote
                                                                                                                                          ;

themselves mainly to individuals, engineers are concerned in promoting the well-

being of the community at large. Persons reluctantly consult doctors when they

are atf;acked by disease, or incapacitated by an accident ; but they eagerly resort
for enjoyment to railways, steamships, mountain tramways, piers, great wheels,
and Eiftel towers ; and they frequently avail themselves of the means of cheap and

easy locomotion to complete their restoration to health by change of air and climate.

Physicians try to cure people when they are ill ; whereas engineers endeavour, by
good water-supply and efficient drainage, to maintain them in health ; and in this

respect, the evident results of medical skill are far more readily realised than the

invisible, though more widespread, preventive benefits of engineering works.

Statistics alone can reveal the silent operations of sanitary works ; and probably no

better evidence could be given of the inestimable value of good water and proper

drainage on the health of the population of large towns, when aided by the progress

of medical science, than the case of London, where, towards the close of the last

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1

century, the dealli-rato exceeded the birth-rate, and the numbers were only kept

up by constant immigrations ; whereas now, in spite of the vast increase of the

population and the progressive absorption of the adjacent country into the ever-

widening circle of houses, the number of births exceed the deaths by nearly nine

hundred a week.

In engineering, as in pure science, it is impossible to stand still ; and engineers

require to be ever learning, ever seeking, to appreciate more fully the laws of nature

and the revelations of science, ever endeavouring to perfect their methods by the

light of fresh discoverirs, and ever striving to make past experience and a wider

knowledge stepping-stones to greater achievements. Engineers have a noble

vocation, and should aim at attaining a lofty ideal ; and, in the spirit of the cele-

brated scientific discoverers of the past, such as Galileo, Newton, La Place,

Cavendish, Lyell, and Faraday, should regard their profession, not so much as an

opportunity of gaining a pecuniary reward, as a means of advancing knowledge,

health, and prosperity.

The remarkable triumphs of engineering have been due to the patient and long-

continued researches of successive generations of mathematicians, physicists, and

other scientific investigators ; and it is by the utilisation of these stores of know-

Aledge and experience that engineers have acquired renown.  higher tribute of

gratitude should perhaps be paid to the noble band of scientific investigators who,

in pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, have rendered possible the achievements
of engineering, than to those who have made use of their discoveries for the

attainment of practical benefits ; but they must both be regarded as co-workers in

the promotion of the welfare of mankind. The advancement of science develops

the intellectual faculties of nations, and enlarges their range ; whilst the resulting

progress in engineering increases their material comforts and prosperity. If men

of science, by closer intercourse with engineers, could realise more fully the

practical capabilities of their researches, and engineers, by a more complete scientific

training, could gain a clearer insight into the scientific aspect of their profession,

both might be able to co-operate more thoroughly in developing the resources of

nature, and in furthering the intellectual and material progress of the human race.

     The following Papers were read :

               1. Light Raihcays as an Assistance to Agriculture.

           By Major-Genekal Webber, C.B., K.E., M.Inst.C.E.

     The great impetus given to a possible extension of light railways in the United
Kingdom through the assembly of representatives of various interests connected
with the subject by the Board of Trade in December last has not borne any

fruit.

     To this committee Lieut.-Colonel Addison, R.E., and Mr. Stovin Warburton,
our Consul at Rochelle, both made admirable reports on the subject of light rail-
ways, the one dealing with Belgium, the other with Western France.

     The so-called li(/ht raihcays of Ireland, constructed under Government and
baronial guarantees, have no analogy either in their engineering or working with
the lines with which the author seeks to familiarise the Section.

     One of the most useful lessons to be learnt from the examples described, both
home and foreign, is the ease and safety with which light railways can be worked
alongside and on public roads, both in the country and through the towns, even
when they are crowded as Ipswich is on a busy day.

     The author's object in bringing the question before what it is hoped may be a
Suffolk audience fully acquainted with agriculture is to get up discussion on how
far what is practicable will really be remunerative on the capital to be expended,

and will lessen the cost of transport between producer and consumer.
      It has been assumed that in a county such as Suffolk there is use for 200 miles

of such light railway, with the suggestion that this length Avould be distributed in
twenty directions, each line having an average length of 10 miles.

     The gauge throughout to be 24 inches, and the lines to be provided with a
turnout alongside of each holding of a certain size, and at each place where an
agricultural industry such as dairying is established. Stations, means of ware-
housing, and workshops to be provided only in the proportion of one to each line,

all stopping places to require but trifling expenditure.

     The rolling stock in proportion to each line to be

                                  2 steam locomotives
                                   2 composite carriages
                                   2 break vans
                                2 timber waggons
                                5 covered waggons
                               20 goods waggons, of sorts.

     The total capital cost, if undertaken on such a moderate scale, would be

287,105Z., or 1,436/. per mile.

The estimate of total takings, allowing one mixed train each

way per diem only, or one all-round journey, and also allow-

ing that one-fourth the capacity for goods is only used, is .     i'10,300
                                                                      8,214
For passengers, one-fourth the capacity of the first-class, and

one-half of the third-class accommodation being used .         .

With 247,200 train lines per annum this gives Is. Qd. a mile.

There are many examples to show that the running cost, pro-

viding for upkeep and renewals, can be kept within Is. a

mile, leaving a nett profit of                                    £6,180

            or about 21. 18s. per cent.

     Extra nett revenue would be derived with extra mileage run, and it might be
expected that two all-round journeys would before long be necessary on several

lines.

     The author omits the question of the purchase of land. Parliament proposes

that the public inquiries preliminary to these light railways shall be essentially
local. Tlie views as regards compensation and the necessity of buying land will
be governed by considerations wliich will be local in every respect ; and if it
is in the interests of the locality generally that their expenditure be kept at a mini-

mum, they need not at most exceed 100/. a mile, or 20,000/. altogether.
     The burthen of the guarantee of this fund I propose shall be the only one to

be taken by the County Council, and when that is realised, I think individual
interests will receive no unfair sliare of consideration.

    At 4 percent., including a sinking fund, this may at first throw 800/. a year on

the rates, but it will soon be earned. In return, the local authority to have a
deferred charge on the earnings, and powers to become sole proprietors at the end
of a term of years, and in the meantime to be represented on the board of direc-

tion.

 2. The Gohert Freezing Process for Shaft-sinking and Tunnelling under

             Rivers. By A. Gobert, Ingenieur Civil of Brussels.

     The process consists in freezing water-bearing strata and running sands by
means of liquid ammonia poured straight into the freezing-pipes, which are sunk
vertically into the ground which is to be frozen. The liquid ammonia, in passing
into gas in the freezing-pipes, produces a more intense cold than that obtained by
unfreezable liquids, which are themselves rendered cold by the evaporation of
                          TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                        795

                                                                   .

ammonia. By adopting direct evaporatiou, the danger is avoided of rendering the

ground unfreezable in the event of the escape of the iinfreezable liquid ; the cost of
the installation is reduced by dispensing with the unfreezable liquid, and with the
apparatus used for rendering it cold ; and the power of the refrigeratiog machine

is much better utilised. The process possesses the advantage of being able to freeze
the bottom without freezing the upper layers. Thus, when it is necessary to

deepen the lined shaft of a mine which has been flooded, the freezing-pipes can be
placed inside the lining, without any risk of bursting the lining by the freezing of
the water which is inside it. In the case of tunnelling under a river, as the evapora-
tion of the ammonia takes place below the water-level, hardly any of the cold is
lost in the contact of the pipes with the water ; whereas a great quantity would be

lost in employing an unfreezable liquid.

4. The Effect of Wind, and Atmospheric Pressure on the Tides.

                 By W. H. Wheeler, M.Inst.C.E.

In this paper it is shown that while a general rule, founded on observations made

hy Sir J. W. Lubbock, as to the effect of atmospheric pressure in raising or depress-

ing the height of the tides has been formulated, no attempt has yet been made to

deduce any law as to the more important eifect of gales of wind ; and shows that
the subject is one of considerable iaiportance to navigation, especially to pilots and

captains of coasting vessels, who frequently have to cross over bars and shoals in

navigable channels with a very narrow margin of water under the keel, while tides

are frequently raised or depressed to the extent of several feet by gales.
     In the author's opinion the use of the barometer cannot be made of service in

predicting the condition of the tide, as the pressure varies on different parts of the

coast, and in order to calculate its eflect on the tide the direction of the gradient

of pressure and the locality of high and low pressure must first be known. This

can only be ascertained by consulting the weather chai'ts issued from the meteoro-

logical office. This source of information is not available on board ship or at many

Aof the smaller ports.    rapid alteration in the pressure of the atmosphere is

almost always accompanied by wind, which affords a more readj' and reliable

guide for the immediate purposes of navigation.

From an analysis of two years' tides at the Port of Boston, and excluding

occasions when the element of wind would affect the case, the author found that

out of 152 observations, 61 gave an opposite result to that which would have been

expected ; a high barometer frequently being accompanied by a high tide, and a

low barometer by a low tide.

    On the other hand, with few exceptions, it is found by experience that when

the wind blows with any force along a coast in the same direction as the main

stream of the flood tide, the tides at all the ports along that coast will be higher

than the calculated height given in the tide tables ; and when the wind blows

against the flood tide, high water will be lower than calculated.

The author gives numerous instances of the effect of gales in raising and lower-

ing the natural height of the tides, and tables showing the effect of the gales of

November 1893 and 1804 on the tides at the principal ports round the coast of

Great Britain. These figures show that the variation is on some occasions as

much as from 5 to 6 feet, and the difference in the height between two succeeding

tides as much as 8 feet.

From an analysis of the register of tides at Boston Dock on the East coast

over two years, the author found that 24 per cent, of the whole tides recorded

were sufficiently affected by the wind as to vary 6 inches from the calculated

height ; thirty varied by 2 feet, seven by 3 feet, six by 3i feet, three by 4 feet, two

by 4i feet, one by over 5 feet, and one by 6 feet 3 inches.

796 REPORT-- 1895.

From these tides, checked by comparison with those at other parts of the

coast, the author has formulated a table showing the amount to be added to or

deducted from the height ot' tiie tide of the day as given in tlie tide tables, accord-

ing to the strength and direction of the wind :

Approximately it may be taken that with a given force of wind of 3 on the

Beaufort scale a tide will be raised or depressed by half an inch for every foot of

range                               with  a force  of from  4  to  6  the variation               may be  expected to  be       1 inch

port to be IG feet above low water, and the wind to be blowing with a force of 5,
then 16 multiplied by one inch would make that tide 16 inches higher, or 17 feet
4 inches.

     It is not intended that any absolute reliance can be placed on the formula, but

that it may be taken as a sufficiently approximate guide by which pilots or cap-
tains of coastiug vessels may be able to form some estimate as to the extent to

which the tide will be atfected, and consequently the depth of water available

over bars or shoals.

                     By W. Anderson, C.B., D.C.L., F.R.S.

    An organ of sixty-one stops and four manuals at the Goldsmiths' Technical
and Recreation Institute, New Cross, London, was found defective in its blowing

apparatus. Sir Frederick Bramwell, Bart., LL.D., F.R.S., and the author, governors
·of the Institute, were requested to look into the matter, and finding that the

maximum pressure required was only 10 inches of water, determined to adopt an
ordinary smiths' fan, driven by an electric motor specially wound and coupled
direct to the fan spindle. Some preliminary experiments showed that a fan with

a 10-inch outlet and a six bladed 25-incli impeller, driven at about 1,900 revolu-
tions per minute, was amply competent to give the pressure and volume of wind

required. Some apprehension was felt lest the pulses due to the fan might
interfere with the lower notes of the organ, but exhaustive trials have shown that

no such interference takes place.

     Imj)rovement of the Scheur Branch up to Rotterdani. By L. F. Vernon

     The gradual shoaling of the mouths of the Maas, coupled with the increasing
draught given to sea-going vessels, rendered the access to Rotterdam inadequate in

the first half of this century. An attempt was made to obtain a deeper entrance
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  797

tban existed at the mouth of the new Maas by the constructiou of the Vonne
Canal in 1827-21), eiiabliiip: vessels to enter by a somewhat deeper mouth to the
south ; but the available depth over the bar of this mouth was often only 12 feet,
and under the most favourable conditions vessels diawing more than 17j feet
could not go up to Rotterdam, and even then the route was very circuitous, and the

journey occupied at least eighteen hours. In 18o8 Mr. Caland proposed cuttings

new direct outlet for the Scheur branch of the Maas across the Hook of Holland,

continued across the foreshore into deep water by fascine-work jetties, and this
scheme was approved and commenced in 1863. The north jetty was carried out
in 1863-74 to a length of 2,187 yards, and the south jetty in 1864-70 for 2,515

yards ; the channel across the Hook was excavated, 1(54 feet wide and 10 feet deep,
in 1868-71 ; and the old outlet to the south of the Hook was closed by a dam in
1872. The new channel was first used by fishing vessels in 1871 and by steamers
in 1872. The jiver was also regulated by training works, in a gradually widening
channel, from Ilotterdam to the Hook. The scour, which had been relied upon for

widening the cut and deepening the channel across the foreshore between the
jetties, proved inadequate to accomplish this, and accordingly in 1882 the widen-
ing of the narrow cut by excavation and the deepening of the jetty channel by
dredging, and its narrowing 656 feet by a low training bend to the south, were
commenced. The river above has also been further regulated and deepened by
training and dredging, and the escape of the ebb tide into the old Maas has been

prevented by the contraction of the entrance to the junction channel. By these
works the river has been made to widen out uniformly from 330 yards at Rotter-
dam to 765 yards at the ends of the jetties; and not only has the navigable
channel been widened and deepened, but the flow has been rendered uniform and

the tidal scour has been increased.

     The minimum depth at low tide between the jetties and in front has gradually

been increased from 10 feet in 1882 up to 26 j feet in 1893, and the rise of tide

adds about 5^ feet. The maximum draught of the vessels navigating the new

channel has increased from 19|- feet in 1882 up to 25 feet in 1893 ; and the
number of vessels drawing 23 feet and over has risen from 16 in 1886 up to 150 in

1893. Vessels can now reach Rotterdam from the sea in two hours ; and the total
number of vessels using this new channel has increased from 6,946 in 1879, with a

capacity of 8,314,000 cubic metres, up to 9,628 in 1893, with a capacity of

20,432,000 cubic metres.

     Before the construction of the Moerdyk bridge, about twenty years ago, and
the extension of the railway to Rotterdam, passengers from England to Rotterdam
and Amsterdam had to go hy Ostend and Antwerp, and by steamer from Moerdyk
to Rotterdam ; and even after the completion of the railway the journey was a
long and circuitous one. Rotterdam also, thirty years ago, was a small town and
a somewhat insignificant port. The new deepened outlet and the extension of the
railway from Schiedam to the Hook, together with the improved accommodation
provided at Harwich, has opened a short cheap route to North Holland, and also
to the Continent beyond. The improvement, moreover, of the river has trans-

formed Rotterdam into a large port ; large basins surrounded by quays have been
found opening into the river, in addition to quays along the river ; and consider-
able extension works are in progress for providing further accommodation fov
vessels and the rapidly growing trade of the port. Having travelled to Rotterdam

in 1865 and 1867 by the old route, by railway from Antwerp in 1880, and down
the river from Rotterdam to the outlet, and last j'ear from Harwich to the Hook,
and also both up and down the river and through the port, I have myself had an
opportunity of witnessing the marvellous development of Rotterdam and the-
changes which the works since 1882 have made in the river between Rotterdam

and the sea.
     The total cost of the river works, up to tlieir completion this year, has

amounted to about 2,950,000/.

                          6. The Snoicdon Mountain Tramroad.

                          By F. OswELL, Assoc. M.Inst.C.E.

     The idea of a railway up Snowdon was first suggested as long ago as 1871
-ft' lien the late Sir Richard Mood, at the opening of the Llanberis-Carnarvon Rail-
way, referred to the possibility of such an undertaking. Several attempts made
jsince that time to set it on foot have failed, but in November last year the neces-
sary arrangements were made with the landowner, and the works were begun in

the middle of December.
     The line is set out with a special regard to the tenants' interests, at the same

time to secure, wherever possible, the finest views for the passengers consistent
with easy gradients and light earthworks.

     Leaving the Llanberis Station, which stands on the main road, midway between

the L. & N.W. Station and the Victoria Hotel, the line follows the stream as far

<as Cae Esgob, where it crosses it in front of the old King's House, passes near the
Methodist Chapel (Hebron) on the left, and at two miles reaches and crosses the
bridle path by a bridge. The first half-way house is passed CO feet, and the second
180 feet below, the tramroad at this point arriving on the watershed which it
follows for half a mile, and crossing the bridle path again at 3| miles, 2,550 feet above
the sea, remains below it (at one point as much as L'OO feet below) until 4^ miles,

when path and tramroad run nearly side by side to the summit, terminating at the

site of the hotel that is to be built here, 3,500 feet above the sea, and 50 feet below
the plateau where the present huts stand. Here a fine view is obtained over the
Bwlch Main Watershed towards Beddgelert, as well as in other directions.

     The length of the line is 4| miles, the total rise 3,140 feet, the steepest gradient

1 : 5'5; the averasfe gradient 1 : 7"83. Two miles of the entire length are incurves, of

which there are thirty-four iu all, with radii of 4, 5, 10, 12, and 20 chains. There
are to be terminal stations at the top and bottom, three intermediate equidistant
passing places, and an additional station at the waterfall (Cenwant Mawv).

     The works consist chiefly of a viaduct 500 feet long, near the beginning of the
line, composed of fourteen brick arches 30 feet span carried on masonry pier a
second viaduct of four similar arches crossing the side of the Avaterfall ravine, an
arched bridge of 50 feet span over the stream, and five smaller bridges.

     The permanent way is all of steel, the rails being of the Indian State Railways

pattern, 415- lb. to the yard, 9 metres long, carried on rolled steel sleepers, to
which they are attached by clips and bolts. The sleepers are spaced throughout
0'90 metre apart, and the fish plates are 3 ft. 6 in. long, wi;h .slots in the ends
to admit the clip of adjacent sleepers, each pair carrying six fish bolts.

     The rack is of the ' Abt ' pattern and laid double throughout, the bars being
1-80 metre long, spanning two sleepers and breaking joint with each other. They

are f inch thick on grades of 1 : 10 or flatter, and 1 inch thick on all steeper
grades. They are carried on rolled and milled steel chairs, which are attached by

heavy bolts to the sleepers.
     The locomotives have been built at "Winterthur iu Switzerland with the object

of saving delay, and they contain all the latest improvements known for this class
of engine. They carry two double differentiating pinion wheels on the axles of

the ' driving ' wheels, which latter run free on the axles, so that the engine cannot
travel on adhesion rails alone.

     There are two cylinders 12 in. diameter by 24 in. stroke ; the rigid wheel
hase is 4 ft. 5 in. There is a third axle carrying trailing wheels under

the cab.

    There are eight break blocks, four to each pinion. These breaks may be

worked bv band, but are applied automatically by steam power if a certain fixed

rate of speed is exceeded.
     There is also an air-break, worked in conjunction with the hand-break in

descending, which retards or arrests the motion by forcing air into the backs of the
cylinders after steam has been cut off.

     All the permanent way material has been made by English firms. The

                      3. Dredyhuj Operations on the Mersey Bur.

                   By Anthony George Lyster, 2I.Inst.G.E.

     The paper commences with a short account of the physical and geographical
features of the river Mersey, tracing its course from the junction of the Goyt with
the Etherow, near Stockport, to the mouth of the river.

   A more detailed description is given of the course of the river where it enters

Liverpool Baj^, and the form and character of the main channel are explained.
     The bar is next considered, its former condition described, and tlie positions of

the main channel and of the bar at the outlet of the main channel are shown to be
by no means permanent, but to have both altered considerably within quite recent

times.

     The great inconvenience of the bar as a cause of delay to modern navigation is
discussed and the urgent necessity for amelioration is shown.

    Dredgings operations which have been undertaken at New York and at the

mouth of the Mississippi are then touched upon, and a comparison is made between
the work done at these places and that in progress at the Mersey Bar.

     After describing the position of the dredged cut, which is also shown by
diagrams, an account is given of two steam hopper barges which were first fitted
up with sand pumps and used for the purpose of dredging a deep cut across the
Mersey Bar, their capacities, rates of loading, suction tubes, hoppers, and general

characteristics are fully_ described, as is also the variable nature of the material
which they are engaged in removing.

    An account of the quantity of material removed by these dredgers is then

given and a description of the new and more powerful dredger, the ' Brancker,'
which was built in consequence of the successful results achieved by the smaller

ones, is entered upon,

     "\yith regard to the 'Brancker' the form and dimensions, fittings, contract
conditions, work done, and the proportion of the whole time available for working

are fully dealt with.

     The fitting up of the steam tender the 'Alarm' as an 'eroder,' with the object

of dealing exclusively with the fine mud on the outer face of the bar on ebb tides,

is next described.

     The material found on the bar is then analysed. Sections taken across the bar
in 1890, 189.3, and 1895 are compared, and an account ia given of observations of
the rate of flow of neap and spring tides both previous to and during the present
·operations, while the paper closes with an expression of the author's views on the
general theory of the formation of river bars, and the advisability of further

increase of the dredging plant.

         5. On the Deodorising of Sewage hy the ITennite Process.
      By J. Napier, F.C.S., Public Analyst for County of Suffolk.

    This process consists of passing an electric current obtained from a dynamo
throujrli sea water or a solution containing magnesium and sodium chlorides,
whereby a portion of the chlorides is converted into hypochlorite, a substance
which disinfects, deodorises, and bleaches similarly to the active ingredient of

bleaching powder, viz., calcium hypochlorite. This solution is called the

electrolised or 'hermlte' solution, and may contain from half to one gramme of

active chlorine per litre.

     The author gives a brief liistory of the sewering of Ipswich during the last
twenty years, showing the present system, particularly the position of the main
sewer as it passes through the town to the outfall.

     The deodorising ell'ects of the electrolised (hermite) solution on sewage, espe-
cially upon that in the main sewer of Ipswich, are dealt with, and the results of
trials made in August and September 1894 and in June, July, and August of this

year are given.

     The installation was at full work during the meeting of the Association. Those
interested in the ele.^trolysis of sea water and its effects on sewage were invited to

visit the works.

                      2. An Improved Portable Photometer.^
By W. H. Preece, C.B., F.R.S., and A. P. Trotter, B.A., A.M.I.C.E.

    The authors begin by defining what is meant by illumination. When light

falls upon a surface that surface is said to be illuminated. The illumination
depends simply upon the light falling on the surface, and has nothing to do with

the reflecting power of the surface, just as rainfall is independent of the nature of
the soil. It depends also on the cosine of the angle of incidence. The lio-htino- of

streets and of buildings may be specified by the maximum and minimum illu^mi-

nation. The primary purpose of an illumination photometer is to measure the
resulting illumination produced by any arrangements of lamps irrespective of their
number, their height, or their candle-power.

     The authors allude to the illumination photometers of Weber- and Mascart,^

Preece's first photometer,^ the authors' modification,^ and Trotter's further modi-
fication,« which was used for measurements and photometrical surveys of streets

and public buildings in London, ] 892. The new instrument (see figure above) is

a box, on the upper surface of which is a diaphragm of white card painted with a
whitewash of magnesia and isinglass. It has one or more star-shaped perforations.

connected to the screen with a system of levers, and the inclination is so adjusted

that the illumination of the screen is equal to that of the perforated diaphragm,
the perforations seeming to disappear when this balance is affected. The illumi-
nation can then be read off on the scale in units of the illumination due to one

standard candle at one foot distance. The object of the levers 13 to give an open

and convenient scale. The scale is graduated by experiment, and does not depend

upon the cosine law. The colour difHculty, where arc light or daylight is to be
measured, is reduced by the use of a yellow-tinted diaphragm and a blue-tinted
screen, the tints being "selected so that the readings are the same as the mean of a

large number of measurements made with white screens. By means of a

graduated quadrant and a gnomon the angle and the cosine of the angle of

incidence of the light from a lamp may be measured, and rules are given for

deducing the height of the lamp and the slant height, and hence the candle-power

of the lamp.

                   3. On Storage Batteries. By H. A. Earle.

    The author traced the history of storage batteries from the time when Gautherot,
in 1801, obtained secondary currents from silver and platinum plates which had
been used in a voltameter to decompose a saline solution. Hitter, in 1808, was the
first to make a secondary battery, in which he employed plates of gold separated
by cloth or paper, moistened with a saline solution; and though he employed

various metals, including lead, the secondary currents he obtauied were only of
short duration, and the batteries of only scientific interest. It would naturally be

presumed that he would have noticed' increased effects when using lead, but we

find that lie used salt water and not an acid solution, and on this account chloride

of lead was formed, which is scarcely soluble and is a bad conductor.

     De la Rive in 18:30 obtained secondary currents from platinum plates in a

voltameter filled with water, and he closely 'approached the elements of our present

storage cells when, among his many experiments, he used in a primary battery a

platinum plate covered with a film of peroxide of lead, and a zinc plate immersed

in an acid solution.
     The first powerful storage battery was introduced by Plante in 1800, but the

method employed for its formation was too long and costly for practical purposes.
Faure, in 1881, reduced this long process of formation by applying lead oxide in
the form of a paste to the surfaces of the plates, but the adhesion was msufScient,
and the life of the cells was too short to give them commercial value. Swan
realised that the active material required a better mechanical support, and introduced
a plate of grid form, the interstices serving to retain the material ; and thisirame,
combined with the Faure pasting, was the origin of the plates largely used in this

country and elsewhere.
     The monopoly that existed for the manufacture of this plate caused other

makers to turn their thoughts to the plain lead plates, and such great advances
have been made both in their manufacture and method of formation, that it is

rapidly replacing the pasted form.

    A type that differs greatlv from the solid lead plate, but which is not pasted,

is the chloride plate, in which the material to become active is a mixture of
chloride of lead and chloride of zinc cast into small tablets, which are fraff ^d by
casting antimonious lead around them under high pressure. The sulbequent
elimination of the chloride and zinc leaves a porous structure of pure lead of a
crystalline nature, of good conductivity, and with a large surface exposed to the
electrolyte, the result being a large capacity for a given weight, and for the space

occupied.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  803

      Omitting the question of cost, tbe cbief points to be considered in connection

with accumulators are-- the chemical action, the mechanical construction, and the
proper treatment of the cells when made.

     The theoretical value of lead peroxide is ·4'44 grammes per ampere hour, or,
roun:hly, one pound is the equivaleut of 100 ampere hours. Presumiupr that the
positive and negative plates were identical, the value would be approximately 50
ampere hours for one pound of peroxide and spougj- lead. As a matter of iact, the
highest capacity plates yield only about seven ampere hours per pound of positive
and negative plates, or sixteen ampere hours per pound of peroxide and spongy
lead, due to the f\icts that a conducting frame of considerable weight has to be
employed, and to the impossibility in practical working of reducing the whole of
the peroxide. To obtain the best results for a given weight the frame mu.st be
reduced to a minimum consistent with the necessary strength and conductivity,
and the distribution of the jieroxide must be such as to admit of the perfect cu-cu-
lation of the electrolyte, and its penetration throughout the mass.

     The behaviour of cells under various conditions is most interesting, and from
the curves that can be plotted we can readily study the effects due to different
rates of charge and discharge, to the penetration and strength of the electrolyte,
and to the ratio of the weights of the positive and negative plates.

      There is a given rate of charge which is most suitable to each type of cell,
mainly due to the disposition of the active material, to its thickness, "and to the
method of its production, namely, whether it has been mechanically applied or
electrolytically produced. Most of the effects of varying rates of charge can be
ascertained from the resultant discharges, but discharge curves have nevertheless
characteristics of their own, which are to a great extent unconnected with the

 conditions of charges.

    A series of curves was exhibited to the Section which gave the capacities of

.seven types of plates at present in use ; the yield was given in ampere hours per
pound of positive and negative plates, the weight of one positive and one iiegative
being taken in each instance ; the variation in capacity for high and low rates of
discharge was also shown.

     The striking point in these curves is the great variation existing in the various
types of plates now in use, but this can be explained to a great extent, for the
heavy solid plates, the active material of which is formed out of the plates them-
selves, must have a large reserve of weight to give them life, while pasted plates,
or plates with a large area, fall higher on the curve. One plate greatly exceeds all
the others in capacity, and this is due to the nature of the active material, which

permits the penetration of the electrolyte throughout the mass.
      Regarding the voltage of a discharging cell, this varies greatly, and is dependent

upon the rate of discharge, the strength of the electrolyte, and other causes. In
considering this question, it will not be out of place to draw attention to conditions
frequently met with in specifications for storage batteries.

     In some instances a given percentage in fall of voltage is allowed ; in others
the voltage per cell is fixed to a hundredth of a volt, above which limit it must
give the specified capacity. This type of specification is, as a rule, most unsatis-

factory, for at what point does our initial voltage start ? On open circuit ?
Immediately on closing the circuit, or five minutes afterwards ? Further, may
the cells stand for half a day after charging before the discharge is laken ? The
best way to meet this latter case is to take the first reading of voltage after the cell
has commenced discharging, and when 3 per cent, of the specified discharge

period has elapsed.

     The most satisfactory specification to all concerned is for the amperes to be
specified, and the time for which the discbarge is to be maintained, the voltage of
the complete battery at the end of tbe discharge being also given, the number
of cells being omitted ; this would require for a low voltage discharge per cell an
increased number of cells, but a decreased number of plates, or nice versa and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

the author finds that this would not admit of the individual cells being worked to
too low a voltage, and that the purchaser would obtain exactly what he requires

at the lowest price,

    When tests are made to check the efficiency and capacity of a battery, we can

place no reliance  on the figures obtained from a single charge and discharge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           as  a

rule no two consecutive discharges are identical, even when discharged with the

same current and down to the same voltage. In tables given in the paper the

first ten charges and discliai-ges from a new cell are recorded. These give a good

idea of the very various nature of results obtainable with slight differences of

charge. The figures show that the higher the voltage to which the cell is raised

on cliarge, the lower the etKciency, and also that a change of condition of charge

may increase or decrease the efficiencj^ and output to an extraordinary extent.

    The strength of the acid solution used has a great effect upon the behaviour of

a cell, also upon its life and voltage ; moreover, a weali solution has a high
resistance, which diminishes as acid is added, till a specific gravity of about 1-250

is  reached, when any   addition of  acid rapidly  increases  the resistance                                                      the resist-
                                                                                                                               ;

ance also rapidly increases as the temperature falls. Each type of cell works best

with a given strength of acid, but there are other most important points to be

considered, namely, that different strengths of the electrolyte have great efl'ect

both on the capacity of the cell and upon its voltage.

    Acid soluti(jns of specific gravity from Tl to 1-3 will vary the voltage as much
aslO per cent., and the highest capacities for various types of plates are obtained

with acid from specific gravity 1-2 to 1-3, and beyond these limits only a small

percentage of the maximum capacity can be obtained, and the curves of mean

voltage for diflei'ent strengths of acid bear a most interesting relation to the

various curves of capacity under the same conditions.

    The action upon plates when first erected and immersed in the electrolyte can,

to a great extent, be investigated by the fall and rise of its specific gravity,

various results being obtained from ijlates in diiierent states, and according to

whether they are left standing or immediately charged. The conclusions drawn
from many tests of this nature is, that fully formed positives with clean nejratives

are but little affected by standing, while partially formed positives and oxidised

negatives sulphate rapidly.

    Regarding the treatment of cells and their life the chief causes of destruction

are impure acid solution, too prolonged or excessive rates of discharge, insufficient

charging, overcharging, long periods of rest on open circuit without charging, and

allowing cells to remain a''ter complete discharge for many hours before recharging.

   We find, therefore, that many causes influence the working and life of storage

batteries, and that many nf these can be varied at will ; the problem, therefore, is

to so combine all upeful effects, that the best possible article is produced with due

consideration to cost.

    In a secondary battery we have lead, sulphuric acid solution, and the resultant

compounds, and nothing else. The ideal cell is one that is indestructible, and this

being given, the first cost and weight, if kept within reasonable limits, are of
little moment.

    At the present moment the life of a cell is its value, and its death is brought

Nowabout by the disintegration of the active material.        this disintegration is

what we have to stop, the material is as good as ever, for nothing is wasted, and

provided it were held in perpetual, firm, and good electrical contact with the

frame in such a manner that the free circulation and penetration of the acid were

not hindered, and the internal resistance not unduly increased, we should have

produced an ideal and indestructible cell.

    The_ author has discussed only a few of the many interesting features in

connection with secondary batteries, being results obtained iu practice.

   4. The Development of the Telephone Service in Agricultural Districts.

             By Major-General Webber, C.B., R.E., M.Inst.C.E.

    On April 20, 1895, the ' Times ' published a letter from the author on the
subject iu which public attention was drawn to the probability that the telephone,

as well as light railways, might be beneficial to rural districts".

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  805

     On May 14, 1895, in examination before the parliamentary committee which

inc^uired into the development of the telephone service in tlie United Kingdom,
 the author also gave evidence on this subject.

     He brings the subject before this Section in hopes that it may elicit discussion

 by practical telephone engiueers. It need hardly be said that his selection of the
county of Suffolk as an example of what can be done is especially appropriate to
 this meeting of the Association.

     The map shown to illustrate the paper was the Ordnance survey, on a scale of

 1 inch to 1 mile. Every town, village, or hamlet where a post ofJice is situated
is marked with a blue disc, and at each of these a telephone call-office would be
 established. \Mien this is also a telegraph office a red flag is added, and at the
 twenty-nine towns where it is proposed that telephone exchanges should be esta-
 blished the blue disc is surrounded by a ring in red.

      The total number of call- offices is 29.
      The lines of railway on which tliere are postal telegraph wires are shown in
red, those on the roads in blue, and the proposed extensions for telephones to tlie

proposed call-ofHces in green.

      Probable connections to private subscribers arc not shown. These will be, in
most cases, by means of twin wires on the same poles. In the case of all the 351
call-offices the communication will be by single conductors and earth-returns, the
connections between the exchanges themselves being by twin wires.

      It is thought probable that, whether the Post Office erects such a system
in the country or not, there will be no difficulty in using the spare space on
the existing Post Office poles, for which, if the work is not undertaken by the

Post Office, a way leave to that department would be earned for the public

revenue.

     In most ca.ses the railways have been avoided owing to the excessive charges
for way leave and maintenance.

      It is not proposed that these lines should be constructed with so costly mate-
rial as that u.sed by the Post Office.

     If carried out by the County Council the whole of the work could be ten-
dered for, and the poles supplied locally, and very little special labour would be

required.

     The poles, insulators, brackets, and wire will be of the same size as is used
everywhere for light, permanent, military telegraph lines, and quite as efficient
and lasting as the heavier material. The conditions are : 25 poles to the mile
small single shed porcelain insulators ; screw brackets having a bent shank ; the
conductors to be of No. 18 bron/e. and to be stretched within inches vertically

of one another.

     The exchange offices will be placed either in county buildings or in private
houses; the call-offices in private houses, where a small payment of 9/. per annum,
with a percentage on the receipts above an average of 2s. a day gross, will suffice
for rent, and for attendance, which could be given by a child over ten or twelve.

   A revenue from the subscriptions of private subscribers may be anticipated,

the subscriptions to vary between 6/. and 10^. a year, according to circumstances,
situation, and services given.

     The official use of the system by the county authorities is a value which the

           _

chief constables, surveyors, and clerks to the councils could probably estimate better
than the author can.

     The being able to converse with salesmen, markets, other farms, outlying
bailiffs, and workmen is an assistance to agriculture which is apparently obvious.

     Small tradesmen will be able by it to keep trade in local hands.

     Regulations of transport and carriage of all kinds will be assisted.
     Economies will be effected in distribution of perishable agricultural produce of

all kinds.

    Farm labour, male and female, would have improved means of obtaining
information as to demand and supply.

     The proposed charge for a ' talk ' would be 2d. within one exchange area. 3rf.
beyond and inside the county.

806 REPORT--1895.

    How far this would affect the I'ost Office revenue in its various branches

--telegraph, postal, and parcels it is not easy to estimate. The author believes that

compensation for losses in one direction will always be found in another.

5. Some Lessons in TeUiohony. By A. E.. Bennett, M.Inst. E.E.

It has recently been demonstrated that the development of telephonic com-

munication in the United Kingdom is ini'erior to that whicli has been attained in

many foreign countries.

   Why this is so may best be discovered by ascertaining by what means,

technical or economical, those nations which have most conspicuously outstripped

us have acquired their superiority. For the purposes of this paper the countries of

Europe have been divided into three groups: (1) well telephoned; (2) indifferently

telephoned (3) badly telephoned.
                                                             ;
   A country may most properly be said to be well telephoned when its smaller

towns and villages enjoy facilities ; for the existence of a few large exchanges in

the capital and chief towns does not entitle it to that distinction. France, Russia

and Portugal all possess good exchanges in their capitals, but are nevertheless

badly telephoned, since their smaller towns and villages are excluded from partici-

pating in the service. On the other hand we find that Norway, Sweden, Switzer-

land, Luxemburg, Denmark and Finland are in the first rank as well-telephoned

countries, since not only their capitals and chief towns, but their villages and even

hamlets, are provided with communication. With them the telephone is no longer

a luxury, but an adjunct of everyday life, within reach of even the poorest.

     Of these six countries, which compose Group I., four owe their development

--to companies and co-operative societies, and two Switzerland and Luxemburg

to their Governments.

   A considerable gap exists between the worst country of Group I. and the best

of Group II. This is the German Empire, exclusive of Bavaria and Wiirtemberg,

which possess their own systems independently. Thereafter the countries follow in

the order indicated in the Table, which shows that Norway is the best and Russia

the worst telephoned country of Europe.

The questions naturally arise, ' To what causes are such vast differences in
Whydevelopment to be ascribed ? ' and '
                                                                                    is the United Kingdom, with its prepon-

derating commercial importance and unparalleled spirit of enterprise, only tenth on

the list, instead of first ? '

   A study of the table supplies the answer. It shows that telephonic develop-

ment is proportional to the prevalence of the following features :

(1)  Low rates;                                                       (2) Local     management  of exchanges                                                                                     (3)  Facilities  for rural
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

intercourse                                                      (4)  Competition.
                                                              ;

At least three of these are characteristic of each of the six countries which

compose Group I.

On the other hand, they are almost completely absent from Groups II. and III.,

the leading characteristics of which are :

(1)  High rates                                                       (2)  Centralised management                                                                                                (3) Neglect of small towns and
                                                         ;                                                                                                                                    ;

rural districts (4) Absence of competition.
                                                                             ;

On inquiring in what manner circumstances differ so greatly in the United

Kingdom as to preclude the possibility of small towns and rural communities

sharing in telephonic communication, it appears that the inelasticity of the

prevalent system of tariffs, which was originally invented for towns, is chiefly to

blame. In towns distances are short, and subscribers, if the switch-rooms are

properly distributed, have seldom to pay more than the unit charge ; but in

country districts distances of several miles must often intervene between the sub-

scriber and switch-room, and as the annual rental exacted increases rapidly with

the distance, the charges become piled up by the extra mileage entirely beyond the

means of the vast majority of the people. What is wanted is the application of

the Austrian (which, with some modifications, has also been adopted in Luxem-

burg) system of tariffs, and under which all subecribers, whatever their distance

808 REPORT-- 1895.

may he from the switch-room, aie put on an equality as regards annual subscrip-

tion, the only difference being in the first payment made, which varies with the
length of line required, the object being to reimburse the owners of the exchange
system once for all for the additional cost of the extra mileage. In Austria the
annual subscription is the same for any distance up to 15 Inlometres (9^^ miles),
the difference being paid b)^ the subscriber on joining the exchange. In Luxem-
burg the same system prevails, provided a subscriber is located not more than
1| kilometres from an existing route. The annual subscription is only 31. 4*.,
including all charges, and the right to communicate at will over the whole of the
Grand Duchy, which measures about 44 x SO miles. Compensation for increased
distance is made in the form of a first payment (which may, if desired, be spread
over five years) at the rate of 4:1. per kilometre of the" line which intervenes
between the free radius which surrounds every switch-room and the subscriber's
place. The effect of this tariff has been to cover the Grand Duchy with telephone
lines. At the end of 1894 there were 59 switch-rooms (all in communication
with each other by trunk lines) and 1,315 exchange hnes. Dorsetshire has exactly
the area (998 square miles) of Luxemburg, and practically the same population

--(211,000), yet it contains only three exchanges--Weymouth, Dorchester, and Poole
   and about 70 subscribers. In Luxemburg there is an exchange telephone to every

160 inhabitants ; in Dorsetshire one to 2,779. And many counties are worse off

than Dorset. Such is the consequence of the different modes of management.
     It cannot be said that such rates as are applied in Luxemburg do not pay.

Accounts and balance-sheets have recently been published which prove that even
lower charges are made remunerative by local companies and municipalities in
Holland, Denmark, and Norway.

     The islands of Jersey and Guernsey are instanced as localities in which tele-
phonic communication would be of great value could it be had on the Luxemburg
plan. At present they are entirely deprived of its benefits owing to the inadapt-

--ability of the Britisli system of tariffs to their local requirements that is, to the

needs of a scattered community. Particulars are furnished also of the Drammens
Upland Telephone Company, which supplies a large and thinly populated district
of Norway with an extensive telephonic exchange system at very low, but still
remxmerative, rates. As a contrast to the Channel Islands, the Aland Islands in
the Baltic, belonging to the Grand Duchy of Finland, wheie there is an exchange

telephone to every thirteen inhabitants, are mentioned.

     The technical features of the Continental systems are, as a rule, best where the
tariffs are lowest and the extension of communication greatest. The conditions
laid down by the author in his paper on ' The Telephoning of Great Cities,'
read at the Cardiff meeting of the Association in 1891, as being necessary to a
well-ordered exchange, are fulfilled more nearly in Sweden than elsewhere,
especially by the General Telephone Company of Stockholm. Metallic circuits
are universal; special attention is given to prompt switching, and Stockholm is
 divided into eight nearly equal divisions, each containing a switch-room, whereby
the prompt and economical addition of new subscribers is rendered easy. The
speed attained in switching is tbat stated in the paper to be practicable and proper
in a_ good exchange, viz., 10 seconds when two switch-rooms are brought into
requisition, and 5 seconds when only one is required to complete a connecfion. The
countries of Groups II. and III. are, with some exceptions, technically behind
those of Group I.

The following Papers were read :

           1 . Tlie Field Telegra'ph in the Chitrcd Campaign.

By P. V. Luke, Deptity Director-General of Indian Telegraphs.

The field telegraph required for the army in India, for the many small expedi-

tions in which it is so often engaged, is furnished by the Civil Telegraph Depart-

ment. The department must be ready therefore at all times to meet any demands

Amade upon it.  suitable equipment has been designed, and a stock is kept at

convenient depots at various points on the frontier; this enables an immediate

start to be made with the construction of the field telegraph in any operations,

while for prolonged operations the whole resource of the Civil Telegraph Depart-

ment can be made available.

    All the equipment is arranged for ' pack ' carriage ; the maximum weight of

any one package is fixed at 80 lbs. (one half the load a mule will carry). After

every campaign a full report is sent in of the workiog, and any defects brought to

light are dealt with at once.

The receiving instrument used is a sounder similar to the one used throughout

India, only reduced iu size. It is fitted on a base-boii.rd with a small Siemens relay

and a key, with connections so arranged that it can either be worked ' direct' or as

Aa ' local.'  perfect portable battery has still to be designed ; at present the so-

called ' dry ' pattern is used.

The unit of olfice equipment, or total needed for one field office, which includes

tents, &c., comprises seven mule loads, but it can be compressed to four loads if

necessary for an emergency and for temporary work. Telephone apparatus is

always included. The line wire employed is iron wire weighing 300 and 150 lbs.

per mile, and stranded hard copper wire weighing 80 lbs. per mile ; light field

cable is used for certain purposes. For poles, where possible, the resources of the

country passed through are utilised ; but for bare country, iron poles are carried.

They are tubular sheet iron in three pieces, fitting telescopically ; the total height
is 18 feet, and weight 40 lbs., the packages being 5 feet long. At twenty to the

mile they will carry three wires, one in a cap, the other two on insulators.

The rate of construction depends on the transport, labour, and character of

country. In the Waziristan campaign a single wire line was put up at rate of

nine miles a day for five consecutive days.

Special arrangements for rapid repair are always made ; for this purpose it is

Information of the siege of Chitral came from Gilgit over the line which was

only completed in 1894. This line is carried over two passes, one 11,600 feet, the

other 13,.500 feet above sea level, where the snow lies from 10 to 18 feet, yet it

worked well all through the winter. The staff at the observation stations close

to these passes are entirely cut off from the rest of the world except by wire for

seven months in the year. The place selected as the base of operations was Holi

Mardan ; best material for a two-wire 200-mile line with twenty offices was at
once collected, together with the necessary staff" for constructing and working.

From this point the wire was pushed on as fast as possible, and a field office was

opened on the Malakand Pass a few hours after the battle. At first it was a

single-wire line, but it was afterwards made a three-wire line as far as the Swafe

Valley, then a two-wire to Dir, and finally one-wire to Chitral Fort.

not being passable for camels ; but for this the wire would have been into Chitral

--by May 12 as it was it did not reach there till midnight of the 17th.

     On account of the scarcity of timber it was necessary to use iron poles very
extensively ; at the Lowari Pass, however, there is a fine pine forest ; wooden poles

were afterwards used.
     After May, cutting the wood became very frequent, and even very difficult

to stop.

     After the start the traffic, which was exceedingly heavy, was dealt with, with

but little delay ; in April 24,370 aud in May 58,935 messages were dealt with,
and their length was much above the average. Shortly after the Malakand fight,

by clearing the line right through to Simla, the Commander-in-Chief was enabled
to talk direct to General Low, and in spite of heavy rains at the time the com-
munication was excellent.

     To give some notion of what was accomplished, it may be stated that a telegram
dated Chitral Fort, May 19, was published in the London papers of the same date.

     The Telegraph Department al.'^o assists in defending camps by running wires
round the camp, so arranged that an alarm is at once given by the ringing of a
bell in the Quarter Guard should a night surprise be attempted, and in many other
ways much aids and assists the military authorities.

4. On the Production of Letterpress Printing Surfaces ivithout the use
                          of Types. By John Southward.

    The author describes a recent invention, known as the ' Linotype ' Composing

--Machine, which enables certain kinds of letterpress printing namely, the plaintext
--of books and newspapers to be done without the use of types. The invention

constitutes a remarkable improvement upon the present methods of typography,

which, in all essential particulars, have remained unchanged during the last four

and a half centuries.

Hitherto, letterpress printing surfaces of the kind referred to, or those repre-

-- --senting alphabetical characters, have been formed by combining together, or

'composing' to use the technical term movable interchangeable types, having

cast upon them in relief the characters they are to represent. In the Linotype

system, instead of such types being composed, matrices, corresponding to them to

the extent of having characters engraved upon them, but in intaglio, are set up.

When a sufficient number of matrices to form a line of given length are assembled,

they are cast from, and a bar of metal formed, which has a surface in relief,

Aprecisely equivalent, for printing purposes, to one consisting of separate types.

large number of newspapers in this cotfntry, and especially in the United States,

have within the last year or two adopted this .system, aud entirely dispensed with

types for the whole of their contents, with the exception of what are called ' dis-

played ' or ornamental advertisements. Many books have lately been printed in

the same manner.

   --The Linotype machine comprises mechanism for first, composing the matrices;

second, casting from them when they complete a line of reading matter ; thu'd,
distributing them back again to their proper magazines in order that they may

again and again be used to form succeeding lines. These three operations are

carried  on concurrently                                                                that is to  say, while  the  matrices  for  one line are being
                                                                                     ;

composed, those of the previous line are being cast from, and at the same time the

matrices for the line before that again are beinsr distributed. The result is that
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  811

lines of, as it were, stereotyped matter are produced much more rapidly than the

most expert compositor could put tog;ether the types or letters of which they

consist.

     The matrices are stored in the upper part of the machine in an inclined
magazine with compartments in which the matrices are assorted in a somewhat
similar manner to that in which the types are contained in the boxes of an ordinary
' compositor's case.' The matrices tend to slide downward hy gravity out of this

magazine.
     In the lower part of the machine there is a keyboard and connected mechanism,

whereby, each time a key is depressed by the finger of the operator, a single
matrix, bearing the character corresponding to the key, is permitted to fall out of
the mouth of the magazine through vertical channels. The matrix then comes
in contact with an inclined travelling belt, which carries it and succeeding
matrices downward, one after another, into the ' assembling block,' where they are
composed, or set up side by side in a row.

     After the line is thus composed it is transferred to the casting mechanism, by
which the metal is injected into the incised lines or letters of the matrices. The
casting box or mould provides for a bar being cast similar in height and body to a
line of types. It is finished by kn ives, which shave off the feet and trim or plane
the sides. One after another the line bars are sent into a receiver or gallej', where
they are made up like lines of ty^pe matter ; but, of course, with much greater
facility than types, being all in one piece.

      Before referring to the third operation, distributing, it is necessary to describe

the matrix. This is a piece of brass I^ inch long, by f inch wide. Its thickness is
that of the letter or point to which it corresponds. The character it is to produce
is punched on to the side, where there is a cavity, in which the letter is engraved

--in intaglio, so that the casting made from it will be in cameo that is, in relief.

At the upper end of each matrix are teeth, arranged in a peculiar order or number,

according to the character. That is, a matrix bearing any particular letter difters
as to the arrangement of its teeth from a matrix of any other letter.

     These teeth are relied on as the means for effecting the distribution or re-
assembling of the matrices. Above the open upper ends of the magazine channels
is fixed a bar which has longitudinal ribs on its lower edge. These ribs are adapted
to engage the teeth of the matrices, and to hold them in- suspension. The ribs of

the distributing bar var}- in conformation at different points in its length, there

being a special arrangement over the mouth of each channel of the magazine.
     The matrices to be distributed are simply pushed forward horizontally upon the

bar, so as to hang from it. Each matrix is thus suspended until it arrives over its
proper channel, and on reaching this point the arrangement of the bar and the
teeth pei'mit the matrix to become disengaged, when it falls directly into the
channel. Other matrices are meanwhile continuing their course along the bar to
their proper points of disengagement. Thus the distribution is done entirely
mechanically and automatically.

     One of the advantages of thus using matrices instead of tj-pe can, perhaps, only
be fully appreciated by those who are practically acquainted with the operation of
type-setting. The lines of a column or a j)age must all, except those which begin

--and end paragraphs, be of a uniform length not of irregular lengths like the lines

of a page of type-writing. When the compositor finds that a line is short, and he

cannot break a word because the recognised rules bearing on the division of words
do not permit it, he has to insert extra or additional space between the words, in

order to spread out the matter to the prescribed length. It is impossible before-

hand to calculate the space that will be occupied in any line by a certain number
of words, because the letters of which they are formed vary so much in width.
Spacing out the matter to form a full line is called justifying, and the necessity for
doing it greatly retards the hand compositor. In the Linotype machine 'space
bars ' are used, which consist of two steel wedges, wluch slide upon each other, the
planes of the outer edges being always parallel. These are inserted between the
matrices of each word as set up, and when pushed up spread out the words, making

the line of the required measure.

--812 REPORT 1895.

    The Linotype machine produces letterpress printing surfaces much moi-e expedi-
tiously and economically than they can he produced by hand composition, or even

by type-setting machines. Ordinary operators attain a speed of 8,000 to 10,000
letters per hour, whereas the hand compositor averages about 1,500 per hour.
This increased product is attributable, first, to the greater speed at which matrices,
as compared with types, can be operated on ; and, secondly, to the possibility of
performing automatically in one machine the two subsidiary operations of justify-
ing and distributing which together amount to at least 33 per cent, of the work of
the compositor. The machine also effects a great saving upon the cost of a printing
office, as type, cases, and other appurtenances are unnecessary.

5. Memorandum on the British Association Screw Gauge for small Screivs.
                By R. E. Crompton, M.Inst.C.E., Pres.Inst.E.E.

As ii result of the two reports presented by the committee appointed by the

British Association to design a standard screw gauge for small screws, a large

number of users, including II. M. Post Office, have adopted them. In 1890 the

London Chamber of Commerce appointed a committee to forward the question of
making the British Association screw gauge universal among electrical manufac-

turers, and a circular was sent round to the entire electrical manufacturing trade,

with the result that with hardly any exceptions the whole trade promised to adopt

the screws, and thus ensure the extremely desirable result of making all the small
screws used in electrical apparatus interchangeable. It is, however, much to be
regretted that a considerable number of users of small screws (the principal

offenders having their works in Birmino-ham) are still using other gauges, and thus

complete uniformity has not been obtained up to the present time. One great

difficulty in this c:;atter has been that of obtaining standard gauges which could be

referred to in specifications or orders for such screws. Wherever it is desired that

the screws should be thoroughly interchangeable it is necessary in such specifica-

tions to have a paragraph somewhat as follows :

A' Testing. Each box of screws will be tested as follows :  handful of one

dozen screws will be selected at random from each box ; these will be tested both

as to the screw portion and the plain portion of the shank by being respectively

screwed or pressed through the corresponding maximum and minimum gauge holes

in the standard plates supplied on loan with the order, and which must be returned

with the finished screws. Any screw which cannot be screwed or pressed by hand
into the maximum female gauge, or which can be screwed or pressed by band
without forcing into the minimum gauge, will be rejected. If more than one screw

in each dozen thus tested is so rejected the whole box will be returned to the

contractors.'

Four years ago I found it necessary to have standard plates made for tlie

purpose of ordering screws to the above specification. I had a number of such
plates prepared, but found the very greatest difficulty in getting them made so that

they would fulfil their required duty, the maliers giving as an excuse that
there was no standard B..\. gauge then existing to which they could refer.

This difficulty can only be removed by a complete set of standards being
made and deposited either with the Board of Trade or at the Society of Arts,

or with a similar central institution; and it is highly desirable that the British

Association should either call together the surviving members of the original
committee or form a new committee to consider the question of making up these

standard gauges and deciding on the place where they are to be deposited.
     One question for the committee would be the requisite allowance of clearance

between the absolute diameters of the various sizes as laid down in the report of

COthe committee and the sizes of the maximum and minimum sfaug'e holes in the

gauge plates.

Another point of importance in order to make this standard screw gauge

universal would be the issue of a short descriptive report, with illustrations, giving

 6. A Uniform Factor of Safety for Boilers and Machinery of Steamships
                                      By JoHX Key.

     The subject of this paper has arisen out of the fact that no uniform code of
international regulations has yet been adopted by the various maritime countries
and States for the general safety of machinery on board steamships, especially
regai'ding the construction and strength of marine boilers and their connections.

   A uniform factor or margin of safety might be devised on broad and intelli-

gible grounds, without making any violent change, on the basis, not of the breaking

--strength, but of the elastic limit of the material ascertained carefully by a

--uniform method of conducting tests that would be accepted by all civilised

countries, in order that any steamship passed at one port for a properly certified

working pressure might not, when new, be altered or reduced at another, similar

in principle to the British system of measurements for ascertaining gross tonnage,
and the regulations for preventing collisions at sea.

     The following tabulated statement shows at a glance the working pressures for
cylindrical shells of steel boilers allowed by the rules of the various authorities :

7. Exjyeriments on the Transfer of Heat through Plates with Variously

      Arranged Surfaces. By William George Walker, M.Inst.M.E.,

        A.M.Inst.C.E.

     The ohject of these experiments is to compare the effects on the transfer of heat
of variousl}' arranged surfaces projecting from the primary surface of a plate in
contact with steam, air or water.

    Two cylindrical smooth vessels were constructed of exactly similar dimensions,

cut from the same brass tube, 6J inches in length and 2Y"'ij inches in diameter, fitted

with water-tight lids, through which thermometers were inserted. When filled

with water no difference was found to exist between their respective powers to
absorb or discharge heat. One of the cylindrical vessels was then fitted with
copper ribs 6j inches long, ^ inch wide, -01;^ inch thick, soldered on longitudinally.
The ribs were spaced equally round the cylinder and tried as follows:

      1. Eight external ribs.
     2. Sixteen ribs, eight external and eight internal.
      3. Eight internal ribs.

     The heating of the two cylinders was performed by suspending them in steam
from boiling water. The two cylinders to be compared were filled with water, and
placed in steam when their temperatures were 65° Fahr.

     The reading of the thermometers, together with the time, was noted simul-
taneously at every 10 degrees. The time was taken in seconds by a ship's chrono-

meter. When the thermometers became stationary at 210° Fahr. the cylinders

were suspended either in air or water and allowed to cool down, the temperatures
being noted every 10° Fahr. and the time in seconds.

     The difference between the temperatures of the corresponding plain and ribbed
cylinders increased from zero and reached a maximum, after a certain time after
which they again closed to equal degrees.

     The ribbed surfaces increased to a considerable extent the rapidity of transfer
of heat either when absorbing heat from steam or discharging it into the air. The
effect was not so great when cooled in water. In the externally ribbed cylinder
the greatest advance in temperature over the corresponding plain one was 18° Fahr.,
33° Fahr., 8° Fahr., when in contact with steam, air, and water respectively. The
addition of the internal ribs to the external ones did not produce much effect.
With the internal ribs alone, the rapidity of transfer of heat was increased when
cooled in water, but practically no effect was perceived when in steam or air.

     The external ribs were more effectual in discharging heat to the atmosphere

than in absorbing it from steam. This difference may be due to the condensed

layer of water which was deposited on the surf^ice.
     Coiling wire round was also tried. The temperature of the coiled cylinder fell

--faster than the corresponding plain one in air, but rose slower in steam due

probably to the condensed layer of water deposited between the wire coils. No

difference was noticed when cooled in water. The comparison of rough and
smooth surfaces when absorbing heat from steam or discharging it into air or water
was also tried.

8. A New Princijile of Aerial Navigatio7i. By Lieut. B. Baden-Powell.

    It has been the constant desire of inventors to devise some means by which we
may be able to navigate the atmosphere. Wings, vertical screws, aeroplanes,
have all had their advocates, and great hopes were aroused in the balloon. Many

proposals were made for steering this aerial buoy, and sails and rudders were ap-
plied to the apparatus, until scientists pointed out that these could be of no avail
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                   81 b

on any apparatus which floated in, and with, one medium. Yet it is thisvery
principle which I wish to advocate, and to state broadly a method by which I

believe we might sail through the air, which depends upon threewell-established
facts. First, a Inte retained by a string will ascend when a wind is pressmg on its

under surface, and will raise a considerable weight. Secondly, in the absence of

wind, the same eiiect may be produced by drawing along the kite through still

air. I have myself been lifted by a large kite under such circumstances. Thirdly,

by balloon ascents, observations on clouds, mountain records, and especially obser-
vations on high places as the Eiftel Tower, it has been found that the wind almost

invariably increases in velocity the higher we get, so that the currents of air 1,000
feet up move about three times as fast as those below. It follows from these prin-

ciples, that if two kites connected by a long string, so arranged that one floats in a
current of air blowing at a diflereut rate (or different direction) from that in which
the other floats, there will be a reciprocal action, the kite in the lower medium
being supported by being drawn along by the kite in the higher stratum, which in

its turn is kept aloft by being retarded by the other.

   A kite of 1,000 square feet area is capable of supporting a man in a breeze of 10

miles an hour, or when being towed at that rate through calm air. If the wind

near the surface of the earth be blowing at this rate (rather below the average), it

will usually be travelling at 30 miles per hour at an elevation of 1,000 feet.

      With two such kites connected together by a long rope, with a car attached to
the rope near the lower kite, if the lower one be drawn along 10 miles an hour
faster than the wind, it will support a man, and travel at a rate of 20 miles an

hour. But if the upper kite travel at this rate it will be retarded to an extent of
 10 miles an hour, and hence the whole apparatus will float along with the wind.
 In this way we might make a light apparatus for navigating the air. The extent
to which it might be steered out of the wind's course, practice alone can determine,
 but even if this be not much, we still should have an air-ship possessing very many
 advantages over a balloon, and to which propelling agents could be much more

 easily applied.

                       THURSDA Y, SEPTEMBER 12.

The Pkesibent delivered the followhig Address :

In a suhject as yet so unmapped as anthropology there is more room for

considerino; different points of view than in a thoroughly organised and limited

science. The future structure of this science depends largely on the apprehension

of the many different modes of treating it. The time has not yet come when it
can be handled as a whole, and therefore at present we may frankly consider

various questions from an individual staodpoint, without in the least implying that

other considerations should not be taken into account. It is only by the free

statement, however onesided, of the various separate views of the many subjects

involved in such a science, that any comprehensive scheme of its organisation can
ever be built up. In remarking, tlierefore, on some branches at present I shall

not attempt a judicial impersonality, but rather try to express some views which

have not yet been brought into ordinary currency.

Elaborate definitions of anthropology have been formulated, but such are only

too liable to require constant revision as fresh fields of research are added to the

domain. In any new country it is far safer to define its limits than to describe all

that it includes ; and all that can yet be safely done in anthropology is to lay

down the ' sphere of influence,' and having secured the boundaries, then develop
the resources at leisure. The principal bordering subjects are zoology, meta-

physics, economics, literature, and history. So far as these refer to other species,

as well as to man, or to individuals rather than to the whole race, they stand

apart as subjects; but their relation to the human species as such is essentially a
Wepart of anthropology.
                         must be prepared, therefore, to take anthropology

more as the stud}' of man in relation to various and often independent subjects,
than as an organic and self-contained science. Human nature is greater than all

formulae ; and we may as soon hope to compact its study into a logical structure,

as to construct an algebraical equation for predicting its course of thought.

   --Two of the commonest and most delightfully elastic words in the subject mav

be looked at once more ' race ' and ' civilisation.' The definition of the nature of
race is the most requisite element for any clear ideas about man. Our present
conception of the word has been modified recently more than may be supposed by

our realising the antiquity of the species. "When onlj' a few thousand years had

to be dealt with nothing seemed easier or more satisfactory than to map out races
on the assumption that so many million people were descended fi"om one ancestor

and 80 many I'rom another. Mixed races were glibly separated from pure races,
                                                                                 '

                   TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.      817

and all humanity was partitioned oif into well-defined divisions. But when the

long ages of man's history and the incessant mixtures that have taken place during

the brief end of it that is recorded come to be realised, the meaning of ' race

must be wholly revised. And this revision has not yet taken effect on the modes

of thought, though it may have demanded the assent of the judgment. The only

meaning tJiat a ' race ' can have is a group of persons whose type has become

unified by their rate of assimilation and affection by their conditions exceeding

the rate of change produced by foreign elements. If the rate of mixture exceeds

that of assimilation, then the people are a mixed race, or a mere agglomeration,

like the population of the United States. The greatest problems awaiting

--solution are the conditions and rate of assimilation of races namely, what period

and kind of life is needed for climatic and other causes to have effect on the

constitution and structure, what are the causes of permanence of type, and what

relative powers of absorption one race has over another. Until these problems are

reduced to something that can be reasonably estimated we shall only grope in the

dark as to all racial questions.

How, then, can these essential problems be attacked ? Not by any study of

the lower races, but rather by means of those whose history is best recorded. The

great mode of isolation on which we can work is religious difference, and

oppressed religious minorities are the finest anthropological material. The first

--question is given a mixture of various races in approximately known pro-
portions, isolated, and kept under uniform conditions, how soon does uniformity of

type prevail ? or what proportions of diversity will be found after a given number

Aof generations ?  perfect case of this awaits study in the Copts, who have by

monogamy and the fanaticism of a hostile majority been rigorously isolated during

1,200 years from any appreciable admixture, and who before this settling time

were compounded of eight or ten different races, whose nature and extent of

Acombination can be tolerably appraised.  thorough study of the present people

and their forefathers, whose tombs of every age provide abundant material for

--examination, promises to clear up one of the greatest questions the effect of

climate and conditions on assimilating mixed peoples. The other great probleok

Howis, far can a type resist changes of conditions provided it be not mixed in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

blood, so as to disturb its equilibrium of constitution? This is to be answered by

the Jews and the Parsis. As with the Copts, an oppressed religious minority has

no chance of mixture, as all mixed marriages are abhorrent to its exclusiveness,

and are at once swept into the hostile majority. The study is, however, far more

difiicult owing to the absence of such good conditions of the preservation of

material. But nothing could throw so much light on this as an excavation of

some Jew'ish cemeteries of a thousand years or so ago in various European-

countries, and comparison of the skeletons with the proportions of the Jews now

living. The countries least afl'ected by the various proscriptions and emigrations

of the race would be the proper ground for inquiry. When these studies have
been made we shall begin to understand what the constants of a race really are.

  We --will now look at another word which is incessantly used ' civilisation.'

Many definitions of this have been made, from that of the Turk drinking
champagne, who remarked about it that ' after all, civilisation is very nice,' up to

the most elaborate combinations of art and science. It is no doubt very comfort-

able to have a word which only implies a tendency, and to which everyone can
assign his own value ; but the day of reckoning comes, when it is brought into

arguments as a term. Civilisation really means simply the art of living in a
community, or the checks and counterchecks, the division of labour, and the

conveniences that arise from common action when a group of men live in close

--relation to each other. This will perhaps be objected to as including all-- or

nearly all mankind in its scope. Quite true ; all "civilisation is relative and not

absolute.

   We shall avoid much confusion if we distinguish high and low types of civili-

sation, and also perfect and imperfect civilisation. Like organisms we may have

a low type of civilisation very perfect in its structure, capable of endless continu-

of the African races who have great orderliness and cleanliness of arrangrements,

and are capable of active recuperation after warfare, without any internal elements
of instability. Again, some low types are very imperfect, and can exist only by
destruction of others, while any severe shock destroys their polity ; the R-overnments
which only exist by raids and plunder, such as that of the Zulus, illustrate this.

Turning to high types of civilisation we may see them perfect or imperfect.

Countries of financial stability, not undero'oing any rapid organic changes, are the
more perfect in type; while those deeply in debt and in continual revolution have

but imperfect civilisation, of however high a type it may be. With these

-- --distinctions before us, that all civilisation is a question of degree, -that there are

types of all variety, from the highest complexity to the lowest simplicity, and of

--all degrees of perfection, or stability and completion, in any given level of

complexity with these distinctions some of the vagueness of verbal usage may

perhaps be avoided.

    Turning now from words to things, we may perhaps see some ground for

further consideration in even one of the best elaborated departments.
      In the much-vexed question of skull measurements, the paucity of clearly

defined racial characteristics may make us look more closely as to whether we are

working on an analytic or an empirical method. In any physical problem the first

consideration is the disentangling of variables, and isolation of each factor for
jeparate study. In skulls, however, the main measures are the length, which is
compounded of half a dozen elements of growth, and the breadth and height, each

the resultant of at least three elements. Two skulls may differ altogether in their

proportions and forms, and yet yield identical measures in length, breadth, and

height. How can any but empirical results be evolved from such a system of

measurement alone ?

   A departure from this mechanical method has appeared in Italy last year by

--Professor Sergi. He proposes to classify skulls by their forms, ellipsoid, penta-

gonoid, rhomboid, ovoid, &c. This, at least, takes account of the obvious differences

which the numerous measurements wholly ignore. And if skulls were crystals,

divisible into homogeneous classes, such a system would work ; only, like all
organic objects, they vary by infinite gradation.

     What then lies behind this variety of form ? The variety of action in the

separate elements of growth. Sergi's ellipsoid type means slight curvatures, with
plenty of frontal growth. His pentagonoid means sharper curvatures. His

rhomboid means sharp curvatures with .small frontal growth. And so in each
class, we have not to deal with a geometrical figure, but with varying curvatures

 of the centre of each plate of the skull, and varying extent of growth from the

centres.

      The organic definition of a skull must depend on the statement of the energy
 and direction of each of the separate elements out of which it is built. The
protuberances or eminences are the first point to notice. They record in their
 curves the size of the head when it attained rigidity in the centres of growth.
 Every person bears the fixed outline of parts of his infant skull. Little, if any,
 modification is made in the sharpness of the curves between infancy and full
 growth ; perhaps the only change is made in course of the thickening of the skull.
 Hence the minimum radius of curvature of each plate of the skull is a most radical
 measurement, as implying early or late final ossification. In higher races
 finely roundfd skulls with slight curvatures are more often found ; and this agrees
 with the deferred fixation of the skull pointed out by the greater frequency of
 visible sutures remaining, both efi^cts being probably due to the need of accommo-
 dating a more continued growth of the brain. The length of growth of each plate
 from its centre in diiferent directions regulates the entire form of the skull. The

 maximum breadth being far back implies that the parietals grow mostly toward

 the frontal or vice versa. The top being ridged means that the parietals grow
 conical and not splierically curved, and hence meet at an angle.

     It seems, therefore, that looking at the question as a physical problem, we are
 far more likely to detect racial peculiarities in the separate data of the period

 of fixation of the skull, and of the amount of growth in different directions, than
                                                                                     '

by any treatment of gross quantities which are compounded out of a number of
variables. The practical development of such a view is the worlc of the embryolo-
gist : here we only notice a principle of treatment of n. most complex question,

which seems to have too often been dealt with as if it were as simple as the

·definition of a crystal.

When we next turn to look at the works of man, it seems that the artistic side

of anthropolog-y has hardly been enough appreciated. In the first place, the theory

of art has been grounded more assuredly by anthropological research than bv all

the speculations that have been spun. The ever-recurring question ' What is art ?

whether in form or in literature, has been answered clearly and decidedly. When
we contrast a row of uninteresting individualities with the ideal beauty and expres-

sion of a composite jiortrait compounded from these very elements, we are on the
surest ground for knowing how such a beautiful result is obtained. In place of
the photographic verity of the person we have the artistic expression of a character.

Whatever is essential remains, and is strengthened ; whatever is transient and

unimportant has faded away. No one can look, for instance, at the composite

heads of Jewish boys and their individual components, published some years a"o

in the ' Anthropological Journal,' without feeling the artistic beauty of the com-

posite and the unbalanced characters of the individuals. What the camera does

mechanically by mere superposition, the artist does intelligently by selection. The

unimportant, unmeaning phases of the person, the vacuities of expression, the less
worthy turns of the mind are eliminated, whether in form or in words, and the

essence of the character is brought out and expressed. Such is the theory of

artistic expression which anthropology has established on a sure basis of experi-

ment, and which is thus proved to be neither fanciful nor arbitrary, but to be a truly

scientific process.

And as anthropology has thus aided art, the converse is also true-- art is one

of the most important records of a race. Each group of mankind has its own

Astyle and favourite manner, more particularly in the decorative arts.  stray

fragment of carving without date or locality can be surely fixed in its place

if there is any sufficient knowledge of the art from which it springs. This study

of the art of a people is one of the highest branches of anthropology and one

of the most important, owing to its persistent connection with each race. No

physical characteristics have been more persistent than the style of decoration.

"When we see on the Celtic work of the period of La Tene, or on Irish carvings,

the same forms as on medireval ironwork, and on the flamboyant architecture "of

France, we realise how innate is the love of style, and how similar expressions will

blossom out again from the same people. Even later we see the hideous C-curves,

which are neither foliage nor geometry, to be identical on late Celtic bronze, on
Louis XV. carvings, and even descending by imitation into modern furniture.

Such long descent of one style through great changes of history is not only charac-

teristic of Celtic art, but is seen equally in Italy. The heavy, stiff, straight-haired,

staring faces of the Constantiue age are generally looked on as being a mere degra-

dation of the imported Greek art; but they are really a native revival, returning

to old Italian ideals, so soon as Greek influence waned. In the Vatican is an infant

Hercules of thorough Constantinian type, yet bearing an Etruscan inscription, proving

the early date of such work. Further east the long-persistent styles of Egypt, of

Babylonia, of India, of China, which outlived all changes of government and
Wehistory, show the same vitality of art.
                                           must recognise, therefore, a principle

of ' racial taste,' which belongs to each people as much as their language, which
may be borrowed like language from one race by another, but which survives

changes and long eclipses even more than language. Such a means of research

deserves more systematic study than it has yet received.

    But if we are to make any wide comparisons and generalisations a free studj'
of material is essential, and the means of amassing and comparing work of every

age is the first requisite. This first requisite is unhappily not to be found in
England. The conception of collecting material for the study of man's history has
as yet little root, and struggles to find a footing between the rival conceptions of

the history of art and the life of modern man. The primary difficulty is the

character of the museum accommodation at present provided. This is all of an.

elaborate and expensive nature, in palatial buildings and on highly valuable sites^

To house the great mass of objects of either ancient or modern peoples in such a

costly manner is impracticable, and hence at present nothing is preserved but vrhat

is beautiful, strange, or rare. In short, our only subjects of study are the excep-

tional and not the usual products of races. The evil traditions of a ' collection

of curiosities ' still brood over our materials ; and until we face the fact that for
study the common things are generally more important than the rare ones, anthro-

pology must remain much as chemistry would if it were restricted to the study of"

pretty colours and sweet scents.

    Until we have an anthropological storehouse on a great scale we cannot hope-

to preserve the materials which are now continually being lost to study for lack of

reasonable accommodation. Such a storehouse should be on the cheapest ground

near London, built in the simplest weather-tight fashion, and capable of indefinite

expansion, without rearrangement or alteration of existing parts. It should con-

tain no baits for burglars, all valuable objects being locked up in the security of

the British Museum, to which such a storehouse would form a succursal, greatly
relieving the present overcrowded state of many departments. To such a store-

house for students all that does not serve for public education, or that is not port-

able or of much saleable value, should be consigned. There the piles of archi-

tectural fragments which are essential for study, but are useless to show the public,

should be all stacked in classified order. There the heaps of pottery of ancient

and modern races should all be arranged to illustrate everj^ variety of form and

style. There the series of entire tombs of other races and of our own should be-

set out in their original arrangement, as in the Bologna Museum. There whole

huts, boats, &c., could be placed in their proper order and sequence, while photo-

graphs of the showy educational specimens and valuables in the public museums

could fill their places in the arrangement. That such a storehouse is needed may

be illustrated by a collection gleaned in a few months' work this year. It repre-
sents the small products of a little village and a cemetery of a new race in Egypt.

But there is no possibility of keeping such a collection together in any Londoa

museum                                             and but for the new  Ashmolean  Museum at Oxford  having  been lately
                                                ;

built with a wide view to its increase, it is doubtful if in any place in England suchi

a collection could be kept together. What happens to one excavator this year may

happen to a dozen excavators per annum in a generation or two hence ; and so long
as space is not available to preserve such collections when they are obtained,.

Invaluable material is being irrevocably wasted and destroyed.

Besides the theoretical and scientific side of anthropology there is also a very

practical side to it which has not received any sufficient development as yet.

Anthropology should in our nation be studied first and foremost as the art of deal-

ing with other races. I cannot do better than quote a remark from the address of

our previous President, General Pitt Rivers, a remark which has been waiting

twenty-three years for further notice. He said, ' Nor is it unimportant to re-

member that anthropology has its practical and humanitarian aspect ; and that as

our race is more often brought into contact with savages than any other, a know-
ledge of their habits and modes of thought may be of the utmost value to us in-

utilising their labour, as well as in checking those inhuman practices from which

they have but too often sufiered at our hands.'

The foremost principle which should be always in view is that the civilisation

of any race is not a system which can be changed at will. Every civilisation is the-

growing product of a very complex set of conditions, depending on race and char-

acter, on climate, on trade, and every minutia of the circumstances. To attempt
to alter such a system apart from its conditions is impossible. For instance, when-

ever a total change is made in government, it breaks down altogether, and a resort

to the despotism of one man is the result. When the English Constitution was

swept away, Cromwell or anarchy was the alternative : when the French Consti-
tution was swept away, Napoleon was the only salvation from anarchy. And if
this is the case when the externals of government alone are altered, how much

more is it the case if we attempt to uproot the whole of a civilisation and social
                                                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                         821

Welife?  may despotically force a bald and senseless imitation of our ways on

another people, but we shall only destroy their life without implanting any vitality

in its place. No change is legitimate or beneficial to the real character of a people

except what flows from conviction and the natural growth of the mind. And if
the imposition of a foreign system is injurious, how miserable is the forcing of a

system such as ours, which is the most complex, unnatural, and artificial that has

been  known                                      a  system developed in a cold country,  amid one  of  the hardest, least
                                              ;

sympathetic, and most self-denying and calculating of all peoples of the world.

Such a system, the product of such extreme conditions, we attempt to force on the

least developed races, and expect from them an implicit subservience to our illogical

law and our inconsistent morality. The result is death; we make a dead-house

and call it civilisation. Scarcely a single race can bear the contact and the burden.

And then we talk complacently about the mysterious decay of savages before white

men.

Yet some people believe that a handful of men who have been mutilated into

-conformity with civilised ideals are better worth having than a race of sturdy inde-

pendent beings. Let us hear what becomes of the unhappy products of our notions.
On the Andaman Islands an orphanage, or training school, was started and more

than forty children were reclaimed from savagery, or torn from a healthy and

vigorous life. These were the results. ' Of all the girls two only have continued

in the Settlement, the other survivors having long since resumed, the customs of

their jungle homes. . . . Physically speaking, training has a deteriorating eifect,

for of all the children who have passed through the orphanage, probably not more

"than ten are alive at the present time, while of those that have been married, two

or three only have become parents, and of their children not one has been reared,' ^

Such is the result of our attempts on a race of low but perfect civilisation, whom

"we eradicate in trying to improve them.

Let us turn now to our attempts on a higher race, the degenerated and Arabised

·descendants of a great people, the Egyptians. Here there is much ability to work

on, and also a good standard of comfort and morality, conformable to our notions.

Tet the planting of another civilisation is scarcely to be borne by them. The

Europeanised Egyptian is in most cases the mere blotting paper of civilisation,

iibsorbing what is most superficial and undesirable. The overlaying of a French

or English layer on a native mind produces only a hybrid intellect, from which

Tio natural growth or fertility can be expected. Far the more promising intellects

are those trained by intelligent native teachers, where as much as can be safely

tissimilated has grown naturally as a development of the native mind.

    Yet some will say why not plant all we can ? what can be the harm of raising

the intellect in some cases if we cannot do it in all ? The harm is that you manu-

facture idiots. Some of the peasantry are taught to read and write, and the result
of this burden which their 5'athers bore not is that they become fools. I cannot
say this too plainly : an Egyptian who has had reading and writing thrust on him

is, in every case that I have met with, half-witted, silly, or incapable of taking care

·of himself. His intellect and his health have been undermined and crippled by the
forcing of education. With the Copt this is quite different : his fathers have been

.scribes for thousands of years, and his capacity is far greater, so that he can receive

much more without deterioration. Observation of these people leads to the view that
the average man cannot receive much more knowledge than his immediate ancestors.

.'Perhaps a quarter or a tenth more of ideas can be safely put into each generation

-without deterioration of mind or body ; but, at the best, growth of the mind can in
the average man be but by fractional increments in each generation, and any large

increase will surely be deleterious to the average mind, always remembering that

there are exceptions both higher and lower. Such a result is only what is to be
expected when we consider that the brain is the part of man which develops and

·changes as races reach a higher level, while the body remains practically constant

through ages. To expect the brain to make sudden changes of ability would be aa

reasonable as to expect a cart-horse to breed racers, or a greyhound to tend sheep.

Man mainly develops by internal differences in his brain structure, as other animals

develop by external differences in bones and muscles.

HowWhat, then, it may be asked, can be done to elevate other races ?                                               can we-

benefit them ? Most certainly not by Europeanising them. By real education,,

hy enforcing a mass of accomplishments and artificialities of life. The general

impression in England is that reading, writing, and arithmetic are the elements of

education. They might be so to us, ' in the foremost files of time,' but they

assuredly are not so to other races. The complex ideas of connectiDg forms and

sounds is far too great a step for many brains ; and when we succeed, to our

delight, in turning out finished readers. Nature comes in with the stern reply, ' Of

their children not one has been reared.' Our bigoted belief in reading and

writing is not in the least justified when we look at the mass of mankind. The

exquisite art and noble architecture of Mykeure, the undying song of Homer,

the extensive trade of the Bronze Age, all belonged to people who never read or

-- --wrote. At this day some of my best friends in Egypt are happily ignorant of

such accomplishments, and assuredly I never encourage them to any such useless-

--waste of their brains. The great essentials of a valuable character moderation,

ju.etice, sympathy, politeness and consideration, quick observation, shrewdness,

ability to plan and pre-arrange, a keen sense of the uses and properties of things

myall these are the qualities on which I value    Egyptian friends, and such qualities

are what should be evolved by any education worth the name. No brain, however

humble,  will be the worse for such   education which is hourly in  use                 while in the-
                                                                                     ;

practical life of a simple community the accomplishments of reading and writing

are not needed for perhaps a week or a month at a time. The keenest interest is-

taken by some races, and probably by all, in geograpliy, modes of government, and

social systems ; and in most countries elements of hj-giene and improvements in

the dwellings and arts of life may be taught with the best results. There is there-

fore a very wide field for the education of even the lowest races, without throwing

any great strain on the mental powers. And it must always be remembered that

memory is far more perfect where a less burden of learning is thrown on the mind,,

and ideas and facts can be remembered and brought into use more readily by

minds unstrained by artificial instruction.

     The greatest educational influence, however, is example. This is obvious when
we see how rapidly the curses of our civilisation spread among those unhappily

subjected to it. The contact of Europeans with lower races is almost always a

detriment, and it is the severest reflection on ourselves that such should be the

case. It is a subject which has given much room for thought in my own dealings-

with the Egyptian peasant to consider how this deleterious effect is produced, and
tow it is to be avoided. Firstly, it is due to carelessness in leaving temptations

open to natives, which may be no temptations to ourselves. To be careless about

sixpences is as demoralising to them as a man who tossed sovereigns about the

street would be to us. Examples of carelessness in this point are among the worst

of influences. Another injury is the inducement to natives to imitate the ways

and customs of Europeans without reason. Every imitation, as mere imitation, is

a direct injury to cliaracter; it teaches a man to trust to some one else instead of

thinking for himself; it induces a belief in externals constituting our superiority,

while foresight and self-restraint are the real roots of it ; and it destroys all chance

Aof any real and solid growth of character which can flourish independently.

native should always be discouraged from any imitation, unless he attempts it as

an intelligent improvement on his own habits. Another sadly common evil is the

abuse of power, which lowers that sense of self-respect, of honour, and of honesty

which can be found in most races. If a man or a government defrauds, it is but

natural to the sufferer to try to recompense himself by any means available ; and

thus an interminable system of reprisals is set up. Such is the chronic state of the

East at present among the more civilised races. The Egyptians are notorious for

their avarice, and are usually credited with being inveterate money-grabbers yet
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

has once been gained it is almost as common to find a man dispute an account
against liis own interest as for himself, and scarcely ever is any attempt made at

false statements or impositions. Such is the healthy response to straightforward

dealing with them.
     It is therefore in encouraging a healthy growth of all that is worthy and good

in the existing systems of lower civilisation, in repressing all mere imitations and

senseless copying, and in proceeding on a rigorously just yet genial course of con-
duct, that the safe and true line lies for intercourse with inferior or different

civilisations.

    And, lastly, the question comes home to ns, In what way is this practical

anthropology to he fostered ? It is so essentially important to us as a race that

we should take good care that it is understood. Whether it be a question of

interference with the customs of higher races, as the Hindu, or of lower savages,

as the Australian, momentous questions may often depend on public opinion
amongst a mass of people in England who have no conception at present of the
race with whom they are dealing. And still more needful is it for those who take

part abroad in the governing of otber races to have a wide view of the character
of various civilisations. Until the present generation there have been two great

educative influences on the view of life taken by Englishmen, the Old Testament
and the Classics. So long as a boy had his ideas formed in contact with Oriental
polygamy and Greek polytheism, he was not in danger of undue narrowness in
dealing with the Muslim or the Hindu ; but with the pressure of modern require-
ments both of these e.xcellent views of other civilisations are being crowded out,

and we meet men now to whom the Avorld's history began when they were born.

There is great danger in such ignorance. All the painful and laborious experi-
ments in social and political problems during past ages are ignored, rash trials are

made on lines which have been repeatedly proved to be impossible, and real

advance in any direction is thwarted by useless repetitions of the well-known

failures of the past.

     It is the business of anthropology to step in, and make a knowledge of other

civilisations a part of all decent education. In this direction our science has a

most important held before it, at least as valuable as geography or history, and

far more practical in developing ideas than many of the smatterings now taught.

To present a view of another civilisation, we require to give an insight into the

way of looking at the world, the modes of thought, the aims in life, the checks

and counter-checks on the weaknesses of man, and the construction of society and

of government, in each case. The origin and utility of the various customs and

habits need to be pointed out, and in what way they are reasonable and needful

to the well-being of the community. And above all, we ought to impress on every

solutions of the problems of community and culture which are as good as our own,

and that no one solution will fit a difl'erent race, climate, or set of conditions.

    How such a sense of proportion in the world is to be attained, and what course

of instruction will eradicate political fanaticism, and plant a reasonable tolerance

of other forms of civilisation, is the problem before us as practical anthropologists.

The highest form of this perception of other existence is reached in the best history

writing or fiction, which enables the reader to strip himself for the time of his

prejudices and views of life, and reclothe the naked soul with an entirely different

personality and environment. Very few writers, and those only in rare instances,

can reach this level ; it needs consummate knowledge, skill, sympathy, and abandon

in the writer, and if without these, it is neither accurate nor inspiring. The safer

course is to carefully select from the best literature of a civilisation, and explain

and illustrate this so as to leave no feature of it outside of the reason and feelings

of the reader. Here we run against the special bigotry of the purely classical

scholar, who looks on ancient literature as a peculiar preserve solely belonging to

those who will labour to read it in its original dress. No one limits an acquaint-

ance with Hebrew, Egyptian, or Arabic authors to those who can deal with those

tongues ; and Greek and Latin autliors ought to be as familiar to the English

reader as Milton or Macaulay. To say that because it is impossible in a business

education to give several years to a working knowledge of ancient languages, that

therefore all thought written in those languages shall be a sealed book, is pedantry
Arun mad.
           few months, or even weeks, on translations will at least open the

mind, and give an intelligent sense of the variet}' and the standpoint of the intel-

lect of the past. And such a course is certainly better than the total ignorance
which now prevails on such lines where the classics are not taught.

What seems to be the most practical course would be the recognition of civili-

sation or social life as a branch of general reading to be stimulated in schools, and

encouraged by subsequent inquiry as to the extent to which it is followed and

understood, without making it an additional fang of the examination demon.

The books required for such reading should cover the life of Greece, Rome,

Babylon, Egypt, and Mexico in ancient times ; and China, India, Persia, Russia,

Spain, and one or two low civilisations, such as the Andamans and the Zulus, in

modern times. Neither histories nor travels are wanted for this purpose ; but a

selection of the literature which shall most illustrate the social life and frame of

Wethe community, with full explanation and illustrations.  need not to excite

wonder, astonishment, or disgust ; but rather to enable the reader to realise the

daily life, and to live in the very minds of the people. Where no literature is

available, a vivid study of the nature of the practical working of their civilisation

should take its place.

Such is the practical scope of anthropology in our daily life, where it needs

as much consideration and will exercise as great an influence as any of the other

subjects dealt with by this Association.

       1. Stone Imjdements in Somaliland. By H. W. Seton-Karb,

    My first discovery of flint chipped spear-heads, knives, and scrapers was in the

Awinter of 1893-4, on my return to the coast from lion-hunting in the interior.

few of those I then picked up are now in the British Museum ; a fevf I gave to the

Earl of Ducie's collection, and the remainder I retained for myself. This winter,

1894-5, on my return from lion-hunting I again traversed, without halting, the

district to which they appear to me to be confined, and obtained several thousands

by diligently searching for them in those places where my previous experience sug-

gested to me that they would probably be found. Of this large number, however,

only about one hundred are really symmetrically chipped as spear-heads. 1 also

gathered a number of cores, chips and flakes, knives, and scrapers. The places
where they abound in the district alluded to were invariably of one character. In
the first place the district was distinguished by the presence of flint nodules upon

the surface, so that these ancient peoples, with whom this place was apparently a

manufactory, had the materials ready to their bandS.
     I observed next that they were more numerous as one approached a well or

the river beds in wliich the wells are dug.

     Also I inferred that the people who made them seemed to be timid, or in a state

of constant warfare with the surrounding tribes (as the Somalis are to this day),
because the spots which seem to have been chosen as factories for the noisy opera-
tion of breaking up the flint nodules and shaping them, were usually retired places
surrounded by low hills, which would prevent the sound from travelling far.
There was also generally a watercourse v^ith steep sides, along which persons
could escape unseen if surprised by people coming suddenly over the surrounding

ridges.

     The implements were most numerous in the vicinity of this central watercourse.
The ground had always a very gentle fall, so that the heavy showers which con-
stitute the rainfall in Somaliland would wash away the sandy soil, and yet keep
the stones lying free and clean upon the surface, in which position they wer«
always foimd.

     Also there were generally no other stones upon the surface besides these worked

 flints.

     There is another point which I cannot explain, though the reason may be

simple ; it is that there was never any vegetation upon the spot upon which I found
these implements scattered, excepting a few scraggy mimosa bushes.

    This was not owing to my not having searched the surface where it was partly

covered with plants, for I was always on the alert to detect the presence of worked

flints while in pursuit of game. I trained some of my men to discover these spots,

which were not hard to iind, being, as I said, bare of vegetation, and the shining
surfaces of these flints reflecting the sunlight and covering the ground, sometimes

for the space of half an acre. I also trained them to pick up and bring me worked

 flints. Still, I often found fine specimens on ground which they had already

searched.

     It is my intention to return once more to this district this winter, which will
 make my seventh expedition into equatorial oriental Africa.

     Finally, out of all my specimens, I think there is not one absolutely perfect

 all seem either damaged or unfinished.
      Sometimes I found an unfinished spear-head on the ground, surrounded by a

 mass of flakes and chips, as though the people had dropped their work, and, carry-
 ing with them all their perfect weapons and belongings, had fled, never to return.

3. On Flint Inbjilements loith Glacial Markings from the North of Ireland.
                        By W. J. Knowles, M.R.I. A.

     The author referred to his having exhibited and described a large pear-shaped
flint implement with glacial markings at the Southport meeting in 1883. The
flake-marks did not show evidence of bulbs, and the artificial character of the
implement was questioned. The author believed that the bulb- marks may have
been removed by dressing, but he now produced specimens which were similarly
scratched, and showed iindoubted marks of bulbs and other evidence of being
artificial productions. They were found at Kilroot, Larne, and Island Magee, on
the shores of Antrim, and though probably lastly derived from the raised-beach
gravels found at those places, he believed they had originally come from a glacial
formation which had been removed by denudation.

5. On Graving Tools from the Terrace-Gravels of the Thames Valley.
                                   By H. Stopes.

     The author exhibited and described sixty-four stones worked and used by-
Palaeolithic man. These were selected from many more of similar types. They
have all been found in the gravels resting on the Chalk, on the Kentish side of tlie
Thames, at levels ranging from 70 feet to 105 feet above O.D. from the various
pits occurring between Higham and Dartford.

     The series consists of seven distinct forms or groups:

     1. Ordinary flakes with used and worked ends ranging from ^ inch to 8 inches

long.

     2. Fragments or large flakes worked all round but brought to a spur or point,
chiefly left-handed, and varying much in shape and size. The points are straight
or curved, pointed and duck-billed.

    3. Cores similar to 2, but with carefully-formed points, indicating much wear
and use, chiefly left-handed.

     4. Split flints or wide flakes made nearly square, with one, two, or more points

at the corners. Wear on sides indicates use as spokeshaves.

5. Ovate, well-formed tools, or large flakes with strong sharp spur or point at

sides or end. These run in size up to 5 inches in width by 7 inches in length.

  6.                       Well-worked tools of the  ordinary axe  (or hache)   shape, with      well-defined

_

point at sharp or thin edge. In many this point could not be accidental. In

others a broken axe has had a point rechipped in such a position that it would not

be able to be readily or conveniently used as an axe.

     7. Nodules of flint very slightly worked at one end, chiefly with broad points
of the duck-bill type. These stones suggest extensive use of ivory, bone, wood,
shell, leather, and all such materials, together with a higher degree'of civilisation
and refinement than is commonly accorded as yet to Palaeolithic men.

                           On6. Paloiolithic Projectiles. Bij H. Stopes.

Ninety specimens were exhibited of stones, chiefly flint, found in the recognised

Palaeolithic gravels in Kent, Bedford, and Suffolk. These ranged from 8 in. in

diameter to less than 1 in., and from S in. in thickness to f in., and in weight from
over 3 lbs. to half an ounce.

The suggested use was throwing by band, from a cleft-stick, or witli a

sling                      preferably the latter, as some could not be held in  a cleft  stick.  Many are
                        ;

very rough stones resembling cores, but are carefully fashioned to shape, and some

Lave obviously been used. The author compared them with some found in the

vicinity of Neolithic settlements, chiefly at a distance of from 70 to 150 yards out-

side the camp.

The majority of the stones are circular and flat, the thickness equalling from

one-third to one-half the diameter. Some are carefully worked all over.
     One series, called gyrators, are very carefully shaped to a thin oval form that

possesses a half-spiral twist. The author suggested that they may have been slung,
and in flight they might describe an ellipse, after the fashion of a boomerang. Some

of these were too thick at the edges to permit of use as flaying-knives.

     Over 20 per cent, of the projectiles yet found by the author consist of broken
tools. The larger stones are frequently the butt-ends of axes, and the smaller have

often apparently been tips. Three shown were broken eoliths from the upper

plateau-gravels in Kent, that had been reworked and chipped by men prior to

deposition at 105 feet above O.D. in the Swanscombe gravels. One of these is

heavily patiuated and waterworn on its older faces. When being struck into its

present form a fine bulb of percussion was made, which is not waterworn.

             7. The Senams, or Megcdithic TeTnples of Tarhuna, Tripoli.

                          By H. SwAiNSON CowPEB, F.S.A.

      This remarkable series of sites, which hitherto has been practically unknown,
 formed the sole object of the author's short journey in March. In all, nearly sixty
 sites were visited, and photographs of them taken. The largest number were
 found on a green plateau in the Tarhuna hills, but others exist in the surrounding-
 wadis. In some places, indeed, they are so numerous that there are few hill-tops
 which do not bear traces of one of these temples, so that the author had to content
 himself with an examination of those which seemed most important. In most
 cases were found large rectangular enclosures of excellent masonry, though
 generally very ruinous, and often subdivided by lines of short square columns,
 occasionally surmounted by rudely designed but excellently worked capitals.
 "Within the enclosure walls, or in line with them, were always to be found lar^e
Megalithic structures resembling the Stonehenge trilithons, but the jambs of which
are often formed of two or three stones instead of one. These (the Senams proper)
are carefully dressed on the side facing the enclosure, and in the jambs are singular
square perforations and angle-cut holes, which appear to have been formed to sup-
port wooden structures.

      The Senams rest on footing stones, and vary in height from G to 15 feet ; but
the average width between the jambs is only IQh inches. In front of some

Awere found massive stone altars, carefully grooved, and flush with the ground.

few sculptures, the subjects of which are Phallic and show Roman influence, were
also noticed, in one case a Senam itself being thus ornamented. There is, indeed,
much evidence to show that the Ilomans occupied and utilised these sites without
knocking down the Senams or destroying the form of worship. Roman work is
mixed up in nearly every case with the work of the Senam builders.

    A feature worth notice is the existence of carpentry forms, which would point

to the district having at one time been densely timbered ; and to the destruction
of these woods (probably by the Arabs) is no doubt due the waterless and poverty-

stricken condition of the country at this day. It is to be noticed, that if we

except the Stonehenge trilithons, there appear to be no other Megalithic remains,

even in Mediterranean countries, with which we can compare the Tripoli series or

which show an equal mastery in the art of masonry.

     In most cases the Senams appear to have stood free in their enclosures, and
were no doubt symbolical and connected with rites of some sort. It is remarkable
that many Babylonian seals show a figure exactly like a Senam placed in the rear
of an altar before which stands an adoring priest. It seems possible indeed that in

the Senams we have symbolic efiigies akin to the ' Asherah ' so often alluded to in

the Old Testament, and which was worshipped in connection with Molech and

Baal.

      Asherah, the symbol of the goddess of fertility, would probably take some
such form, and from such a worship sprang no doubt the widely spread customs of
squeezing between columns and stones to cure diseases. Further evidence in

favour of these being temples of a form of Baal worship may be found in their

situations, always on hill-tops, essentially ' high places,' and possibly also in the
character of the carvings.

                               By Abthuk Montefiore, F.G.S., F.R.G.S.

    --Distiibution of the Samoyads. This primitive group of the Ural-Altaic family

may be found within an area of <rreat extent and very various nature. Samoyads

may still be observed on the northern slopes of                                                                                                                                                       the Altai              range                                they still  dwell

in the afforested valleys of the Yenisei and the Ob, and they continue to thrive on

the frozen treeless plains of Siberia and Arctic Russia. From the ultimate sources

of the Yenisei in the heart of Asia, they spread northward until their advance is

stayed by the waters of the Arctic Ocean. From the Khatanga river in the far

east they reach westward into Europe, even to the shores of the White Sea. And

-we have the authority of Mr. F. G. Jackson {The Great Frozen Land, cap. vi.)

--for saying that they are still migrating westward a small group having recently

settled in Russian Lapland, and already contributed to the modification of Lapp

iiabits and fashions.

   --The Arctic Samoyad. The Samoyad of the Arctic Tundras is the least changed,

.and perhaps the most interesting of the whole family. Until recently less has
ibeen known of his ways and means, of liis ideas and morality, of the country in

which he lives, and the adaptation of himself to his environment, than of the other

·branches of the same group. The very impoverishment of his resources has calcu-
lated to make him more characteristic and distinct.

   --Ethnology. Undoubtedly the term Ural-Altaic is conveniently applied to the
--four great Mongoloid groups the Tungus, the true Mongols, the Turks, and the

Finns ; and the Finnic group may also be properly regarded as made up of

the Ugrian races, the Permian, the Bulgarian, the true Finns, and the Samoyads.

From another point of view, however, it would be well to include the Samoyads in

the Finnic subdivision. For the Samoyads are more nearly allied to tlie Finns than

Ugrians, Permians, and Bulgarians                                                                                                                                                                     their speech  is Finn, their                                customs related :
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

«,nd the true Finns, as well as the quasi-Finns, possess in numerous instances

survivals and traces of what is to this date in full development among the

Samoyads.

   --Name of Samoyad. This can be shown to be not of Russian but of Permian

And even Finnic origin, and to mean not ' eaters of themselves,' or ' cannibals,' but

' swamp-dwellers.' The old Russian word for them, then, does not suggest canni-
balistic custom, but may be translated ' eaters of raw flesh,' which they are to this

---day.
     Language. Closely allied to the Finnic tongue, the Samoyad speech shows,

of all the Ural-Altaic languages, the highest development in agglutination. This

is carried so far that it almost reaches inflection. ' Samoyad, indeed, may be

a-egarded as a nexus between the inflexional Indo-Germanic and the agglutinative

--Mongolian.
     Religious Ideas. Although professing Christianity and the Greek Church

[owing to the zeal with which every Russian promotes the cause of his Church], the
Samoyads have not relinquished faith in their old gods, and still cherish a crypto-

paganism. The impersonal Niim, creator of the universe, dwells in the heavens
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

rial, however, is the idea that the coloured bands of the rainbow form the border

of his robe.^ Veneration of the supernatural is also shown in the cult of the

natural: curiously shaped trees, large stones, somewhat resembling the human

form, and even roughly shaped stakes of wood, are locally revered. This venera-

tion is also extended to rude models of these stakes, which are made sufficiently

small to carry about, and are called Chaddi.

    Morality.--As a rule, and, of course, wherever they are professed Christians,

two wives are not imcommou. The offence of adultery is rare, and fornication is

not approved. The temperament of the Samoyad is amiable ; lie is hospitable,
cheery, and even-tempered. Sentiment is hardly known to him, and he has no-

good reason, or hope of future reward for the honest or benevolent act.s he performs.

Idleness is often necessitated by circumstances, but the naturally active man is dis-

cernible even then. The Samoyad is capable of politeness and of sobriety, though

the Russian traders do their best to destroy the latter virtue. The Samoyad is-

neighbourly ; the youug are obedient and respectful ; and the old are tenderly cared
for. Inexpressibly filthy in their customs, the Samoyads exhibit as a race social

--virtues of a high order.

The highest English authority on the Samoyads is Mr. F, G. Jackson, and in

his work on the subject {The Great Frozen Land) he tells us that the physique of

the Samoyad is sturdy : the shoulders being broad, the legs stout, though short, and

the arms highly developed. The head is out of proportion to tbe body in its large^

ness, and the neck is short and thick. The sense of hearing is extremely acute, and

the sight remarkably keen                                                                                                                             the power of grasp is considerable.                                                              The Samoyads run

   --Occupations. These are chiefly hunting and fishing. To enable them to do the

former, they break and train the reindeer until these animals have reached a high

stage of excellence as draught beasts. The sledge, too, is perfectly adapted to the

physical difficulties presented by the Tundra. The reindeer is the ' staff of life on

the Tundra. Its skin makes the tent or ' choom ' which fends the wild weather

from his master ; it also forms the chief fabric of his clothing. Its body constitutes

the main food of the' Samoyad, and its hide and sinews his harness, cordage, and

thread. It is the only animal which is fitted to draw burdens across the Tundra, a

quaking bog in summer, a howling frozen plain in winter. In the latter season,

the Samoyad hunts, attacks, and snares the white bear, brown bear, sable, fox,

lynx, and other fur-bearing animals                                                                                                                                                                     in summer, he                             catches enormous                                    numbers of

ing of the snow makes it impossible for him to take heavy loads across the Tundra;

but a contingent is usually left behind to complete the season's harvest. These the

Samoyad rejoins before the rivers burst free from the ice, and the whole country

becomes an impassable swamp.

               3. On Cayinihalism. By Captain S. L. Hinde.

Captain Hinde, who has been travelling and fighting for some years in the Congo

basin, and has therefore had many almost unprecedented opportunities of observ-

ing the natives, gave the following information witb regard to cannibalism :

Almost all the races in the Congo basin practise cannibalism, and though in

some parts it is prevented by the presence of white civilisation, in others it seems

Anto be on the increase.                                                                                                                              extensive traffic in human flesh prevails in many dis-

tricts, slaves being kept and sold as an article of food.

The different tribes have various and horrible methods of preparing the flesh

for eating ; in some instances, before the death of the victim, certain tribes of the

Bangala race themselves acknowledge that they break the arms and legs of the

victim, and place the body, thus mutilated and still living, in water for two or
three days, ou the supposition that this pre-mortem treatment renders the ilesh
more palatable. There are also distinct tribal preferences for various parts of the
body, and it is remarkable that, contrary to an ig-norant yet very generally
accepted theory, the negro man-eater never eats flesh raw, and certainly takes
human flesh as food purely and simply, and not from any religious or superstitious

reasons.

      2. On the Origin of the Dance. By Mrs. Lilly Grove, F.R.G.S.

       The study of the history of the dance throws a light on manners and customs
of various races, on connection between nations geographicallj' remote, and especi-

ally on primitive religion.
      After a long study of the subject, the conclusion arrived at is that most dances

were once a form of worship, or at least a form of magic. Many myths relate that

the deities not only delighted in seeing the dance, but also enjoyed performing in

it. Promises of a beaven in which there will be much dancing and many dancers

are held out by several religions, even by monotheist ones, and even by some
Christian Fathers. All ritual dances are grave, reverent, and symbolical of joy,
or gratitude, or sorrow. The object of this Paper is to point out that most dances

have a sacred origin, and to show what survivals we have of these dances. Three

--forms are chosen in support of the theory the weapon dances, the ritual dances,

and the funeral and death dances.
      Weapons were once worshipped and held sacred, hence numerous sword dances

--in all parts of the globe in the Himalayas, in the Andes of Bolivia, in Scotland,

in Spain, in Scandinavia, generally in mountain districts.
      Ititual dances are so numerous that a choice has to be made, and only those of

Christian worship will be considered ; among those the Los Seises dance of the
Seville Cathedral and the dancing procession of Echternach, which latter probably
arose from a penitential vow. Medicine dances belong generally to the ritual, for
the mystery or medicine man is usually also the priest.

     Funeral dances are world-wide among pagans and Christians; they origi-
nate in what the author of ' The Golden Bough ' calls sympathetic magic, they are
often a form of exorcism, or of propitiation of death, or arise from fear of the soul
of the departed. The dance being a form of worship of the Deity, eventually also

becomes a form of reverence towards the departed.
      Pagans mostly honour aged men, chiefs, and priests by such a funeral dance,

 while Christians perform funeral dances to rejoice over the death and consequent

delivery from evil of a young person who has died in a state of innocence. Parallels
 have been made between the ' Lemuric ' dances of the Roman Empire and the
dance macatre, but the parallel is not complete ; in England the latter was called

 the ' Doleful Dance,' also the ' Shaking of the Sheets.' Churchyards used to be the

most favourite places for the dance, and the Welsh danced in their graveyards
after the conclusion of the sermon until quite recently. At one time of the world's
history the dance must have been exclusively an act of homage towards the Deity,
or the ministers and earthly representatives of the Deity.

    As nations gi'ow out of infancy and become more artificial and afl'ected, the

dance loses in siarnificance.

       4. On EthnograpJiical Observations in Bast Aberdeenshire.^

                                     JBij J. Gray, B.Sg.

In August last, observations were made by the Buchan Field Club on the

people at the Mintlaw Gathering, in the centre of north-east Aberdeenshire. At

the entrance, the colour of hair and eyes, and shape of nose of 2,309 males and

649 females were noted. In a tent in the grounds measurements were made of the

height (standing and sitting), and length and breadth of head, of 169 adult native

males. The people belonged to the agricultural class. The gate observations gave

the following gross percentages:--//a!>-- fair 9-7, red 5-7, brown 64-4, dark 20-2
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

^yes--dark 26-2, medium 49-0, light 24-8 ; wows--straight 56-4, concave 19-9, high
bridge or Eoman 14-8, sinuous or wavy 67, and aquiline or Jew 2-2.

In the gate observations, it was found that in the majority of cases light eyes

were associated with fair hair, and dark eyes with dark hair. The ratio'^of light

to dark eyes changed gradually from fair hair, through red and brown hair, to dark
hair. On analysing the combinations of hair colour with the dili'erent types of

noses, it was found that the sum of the fair and red hair associated with each type

of nose was, in each case, almost the same, but the number of cases with dark hair

was least with concave noses and greatest with aquiline noses. This appears to

indicate that one of the primitive race-types had fair hair, light eyes, and a con-

cave nose. This agrees with the Germanic or Oanstadt type. The extreme

cephalic indexes obtained in the tent measurements were 86 and 70 ; but the most
usual indexes were 77 and 79. The diagrams of head breadths and lengths,

heights, and cephalic indexes all show two principal maxima near the centre, with

at least two smaller maxima at the sides. The prevailing type in the district has

brown  hah-, medium  eyes, and a  straight  nose                         but  this  appears to be a mixed
                                                                      ;

type, sprung from the mixture of a dolichocephalic fair race with two dark races,

one dolichocephalic and tall, and the other brachycephalic and short.

   A Discussion on interference with the civilisation of other races was opened by

the reading of the following Paper : '

  1. Protest against the Unnecessary Uprooting oj" Ancient Civilization in

                 Asia and Africa. By Robert N. Oust, LL.D.

The tendency on the part of Europeans, and English and French especially,

to denationalise the customs of populations which come under their influence, is

to be deplored, so long as those customs are not contrary to the moral laws of

the human race. It is not in any way evident that the customs of European

nations are  in  themselves better than those of  the Asiatic and North African                                                                                                                                              as

reo-ards the barbarous races of Africa south of the Sahara, Oceania, and North

America the argument is not pressed, but is restricted to those regions where the

inhabitants have an ancient civilization of their own, such as Persia, India, China,,

and Japan.

Any forcible change of dress, language, social practice, and municipal law,

is to be deplored : the progress of education, civilization, and contact with nations

in a superior state of culture will do its own work insensibly without wound-

ing the self-respect of ancient nations : the argument applies particularly to

British India. Nothing can be more prudent and rational than the action of the

British Government, but associations of irresponsible persons are found in Great

Britain interfering with the prejudices of a great nation of nearly three hundred

millions, which may eventuate in very serious consequences. The study of the-

gradual development of an Asiatic society by voluntary adoption of European

influence will be most interesting to the student of anthropologj\

2. The Light thrown on Primitive Warfare by the Languages and Usages-

          of Historic Times. By Rev. G. Hartwell Jones, M.A.

    The institution of war dates from the highest antiquity; nor was it an unmiti-
gated evil. It deeply influenced civilisation. Early Greece and Italy may be
taken as types of other ' Aryan ' countries, and the evidence they afibrd can be

supplemented by evidence from other quarters.

    The sources of evidence are (1) the dead languages, especially Greek and Latin
(2) survivals among civilised races and the customs of backward savages to-day ; all
of which point to the evolution of civilisation in Greece and Italy from a primitive-

barbarism.

The influence of war was far-reaching. It left a deep impression upon (1)

language, as is seen  in  the  words  common  to  diS'erent  branches  of  the                                             '"

                                                                                * Aryan

stock; (2) society: for example, marriage and social distinctions; (3) religion.

Religious feuds were often the occasion of war; the gods intervened in these

struggles, as is seen from the prominent place occupied by war-gods in the-

mythologies of ' Aryan ' races.

     The history of primitive warfare exhibits three stages of growth. It is impos-

sible to differentiate them clearly, but we may distinguish w^ar (1) in the hunting

--stage. Here the methods would be of the crudest kind stones, charred stakes,

horns, and a rude bow and arrows were employed ; battles were marked by cruelty

and treachery. (2) The ;jrt«forffZ stage. Here the ox figured frequently; it was-
often the cause of hostilities, as witness some names for battle. (3) With the rise

of agriculture war assumed a fiercer aspect, greater issues being at stake.

     Within the limits of one country there was sometimes a variety of usage,
according to the different influences, mainly geographical and racial, to which its

parts were subjected. Language reflects this diversity. Primitive warfare was

religious in its character, war-gods interposing, each with champions and totems.

The early Latin god Janus is a good instance of the survival of animism down to
a late time.

     The cames of primitive warfare were diverse. At first it was carried on chiefly

for (1) self-defence, for protection of food supplies, shelter, and wives. Animals
and pastures were frequently grounds of contention. In this respect Sanskrit is

very instructive. (2) Wars of aggression do not fall much within the scope of our

inquiry.

The earliest wars were characterised by cruelty. Those who were incapacitated

from fighting by age were put to death, sometimes voluntarily.

Even as late as the time of Jlomer physical force, rather than shill, distinguished

the warrior and decided battles. Bodily strength, therefore, marked out men for

leadership, and a nobility gradually grew up from the warrior class.

     Battles were preceded by saa-tjices, and it is significant that these were per-

formed by the chieftain, who combined in his person functions afterwards separated.

The nature of the country dictated the tactics, according as the ground was

swampy, rocky, or wild. At first only foot-soldiers were employed; chariot-

driving followed                                                                                 horse-soldiers were a more recent development.  Although there
                                                                                              ;

are indications even in the Vedic hymns of riding being known, yet as^late as
Homer's dme it was rather a special art than a common practice.

Relationship was the basis of arrangement on the battle-field.

     The usages after the conclusion of hostilities are instructive. (1.) Reverence
ioivards the gods. They were invited to desert, and their attendants were pro-

tected from violence.                                                                            (2.)  Males  were  ruthlessly put to  the  sword                                  women  and
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

children were treated barbarously. Indignities were heaped upon the conquered,

and bodies were sometimes mutilated. It is impossible to resist the conclusion

that human sacrifice was practised.

An examination of the material on this subject establishes several interesting

points--the religious character of early civilisation, the divergence of the branches
of the ' Aryan ' family of races, and their development in different directions.

cation. It is situated in the plain of Ilidze, some eight miles to the west of Sara-

i'evo, the capital of Bosnia. This plain, which extends for about seven miles in

 ength and four or five in breadth, is composed of alluvial materials brought down

from the surrounding mountains by rain and a number of streams which here

meet, and it is tlierefore highly probable that in former times it was partially a

lake-basin. In 1893, while workmen were engaged in excavating the foundations

of a farm dairy in a cultivated field, it was observed that the soil turned up con-

tained fragments of pottery, flint implements, stone axes, and other remains of a

primitive people. These discoveries led to an investigation of the locality by the

Government, under the supervision of the celebrated archseologist, Mr. Eadimsky.

A perpendicular section, 6 to 8 feet in depth, showed first a superficial layer

of ordinary soil, 12 to 15 inches thick, then a series of thin beds, more or less

stratified, of clay, charcoal, ashes, mould, &c., containing the above-named relics

of human industry. This relic-bed, which attained a thickness of 4 or 5 feet, and

--a superficial area of about 5 acres, lay immediately above a bed of fine adhesive

clay in situ i.e. deposited by natural causes prior to the founding of the prehistoric

settlement. By observing that on the surface of this clay there were, occasionally,

irregularly shaped hollows of variable extent, Mr. Radimsky was led to formulate

--the opinion that they were the foundations of the huts of the first inhabitants an

opinion which gave rise to an animated controversy among the members of Con-

gress. The deposits containing the relics formed a low mound, rising in the middle

to about a couple of yards above the surrounding laud. Near their surface, but

below the superficial layer of soil, some burnt clay-castings of the timbers of which
the huts were constructed were met with in several localities. The relics con-

sisted, chiefly, of stone implements and fragments of pottery, all of which were

interspersed uniformly throughout the debris.

These remains were so abundant as to suggest the idea that the inhabitants of

Butmir carried on special industries for their manufacture. Stone implements

knives, arrow>-heads, scrapers, polished axes (with the exception of perforated ones),

--and tools were in all stages of manufacture. In regard to the perforated axe-

heads, it was curiously noted that, out of twenty-five collected, only two were

"whole, and not a single core had hitherto been found. The material out of which
they were made was not found in the neighbourhood, and hence it was supposed

that the perforated axes had been imported, thus indicating a knowledge of the

division of labour among these early settlers. The pottery had been ornamented

with a great variety of designs, among which a few specimens with a spiral orna-

Amentation excited much interest among the members of Congress.  special

feature of this discovery is the existence of a number of small clay images, or

figurines, rudely representing the human form--among them being one, a head of

terra-cotta, disclosing art of a superior kind. In conclusion he observed that those

who had not the opportunity of studying the original report would find a notice of

the settlement and of the controversies to which it has given rise in his forthcom-

ing work, ' Rambles and Studies in Bosnia-Herzegovina.'

    2. On Primitive European ^ Idols ' in the Light of New Discoveries.
                        By Arthur J. Evans, M.A., F.S.A.

     Schliemann's discoveries at Troy first called general attention to a class of
primitive images of clay, marble, and other materials. Others, of which some new

and remarkable examples were exhibited, had since been found in the ^gean

Islands and the mainland of Greece. In their more developed forms they appeared
as nude female figures, more rarely male. Lenormant and others had sought their
prototype in a nude female figure seen on some Chaldtean cylinders which, as

Nikolsky has now shown, represented the Underworld Goddess Sala, an equivalent
of Istar. More recently M. Salomon Reinach has boldly attempted to turn the
tables and derive the Eastern type from the European side. Mr. Evans combated

both these theories. That the tstar type had influenced some of the later ^Egean
figures was probable. But the two classes were originally independent. The Greek
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.       835

and Trojan figures fitted on to a primitive European family, the evolution of which
could be traced from the rudest beginnings. Thraeian and Danubian examples
carried this diffusion to the Carpathians. Beyond this, again, a curiously parallel

-- --group of amber, bone and stone characterised a vast northern Neolithic province

including the Polish caves and the Baltic amber coast and extending to the shores

of Lake Ladoga. Attention was next called to certain recent and partly unpub-

lished discoveries of primitive painted images in Sicily and the Ligurian caves, and
after bringing them into relation -with others from Bosnia and Carniola, the author

showed that they had here the nearest prototypes to the Mycenajan. He exhibited

--a curiously rude squatting figure of Pentelic marble found near Athens the
--earliest example of Attic art and after adducing parallel examples from Thrace

and the Peloponnese, claimed a cousinship for them in the so-called ' Cabiri ' of

what had been hitherto known as the ' Phoenician Temple ' of Hagiar Kim in

Malta. This primitive building was really a West Mediterranean example of a
class illustrated by the primitive architecture of Sardinia, the Balearic Islands, and
even our own chambered barrows. Its Libyan afiinities had been noticed by
Fergusson, and the so-called Cabiri, with Aegean connections on the one hand,

seemed to stand in a direct relationship with the rude squatting figures of Mr,

Petrie's ' New Race.' Turning to Spain, Mr. Evans called attention to a class of

stone figures singularly resembling the Trojan discovered in Neolithic and early

Bronze Age deposits by the brothers Su'et, and to which their most recent excava-

tions had added rich materials. Finally, as the north-westernmost example of this
whole primitive class, he referred to the discovery of a whalebone ' idol ' amongst
Neolithic relics at Skara, in Orkney. The sepulchral relation in which these so-
called ' idols ' were usually discovered pointed to the conclusion that they had here
an illustration of the widespread practice among primitive peoples of placing small

figures in the grave as substitutes for human victims.

         5. The People of Southern Arabia. By J. Theodore Bent.

     The two classes of natives discussed in this paper are resident in the Hadramut
and Dhofar districts of South-eastern Arabia. First, those of the Hadramut are
described. Their fanaticism and complex tribal system present great difiiculties

--to the anthropologist. Descriptions are given of the three divisions of the inhabit-

ants namely, the Bedouins, the Arabs proper, and the Sayyids, or hierarchical
nobility. But the Bedouins and their manners and customs, as being a distinctly
aboriginal race, are described with greater minuteness. Their religion is discussed,
and the secret manner in which they maintain their cult is suggested as a parallel

to other secret cults in other parts of the Mohammedan world.

     Secondly, the district of Dhofar, the country from which the ancients obtained
frankincense, is next described, and the Bedouins of the Gara tribe compared with
those of the Hadramut : their manners and customs, and the general conditions
under which they live, are described.

                          Section K.--BOTANY.

--Pbesident of the Sectioit. W. T. Thiselton-Dter, M.A., F.R.S., O.M.G.,

                         C.I.E., Director of the Royal Gardens, Kew.

                     THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12.

The President delivered the following Address :

The estahlishment of a new Section of the British Association, devoted to Botany,

cannot hut be regarded hy the botanists of this country as an event of the greatest

importance. For it is practically the first time that they have possessed an inde-

pendent organisation of their own. It is true that for some years past we have

generally been strong enough to form a separate department of the old Biological

Section D, on the platform of which so many of us in the past have acted in some

capacity or other, and on which indeed many of us may be said to have made our
Wefirst appearance.
                     shall not start then on our new career without the remem-

brance of filial affection for our parent, and the earnest liope that our work may

be worthy of its great traditions.

     The first meeting of the Section, or, as it was then called, Committee, at Oxford

was held in 1832. And though there has been from time to time some difference

in the grouping of the several biological sciences, the two great branches of biology
have only now for the first time formally severed the partnership into which they

entered on that occasion. That this severance, if inevitable from force of circum-

stances, is in some respects a matter of regret, I do not deny. Specialisation is

inseparable from scientific progress ; but it will defeat its own end in biology if the

specialist does not constantly keep in touch with those fundamental principles which

Weare common to all organic nature.  shall have to take care that we do not

Ddrift into a position of isolation. Section undoubtedly afforded a convenient

opportunity for discussing many questions on which it was of great advantage that

workers in the two different fields should compare their results and views. But

I hope that by means of occasional conferences we shall still, in some measure, be

able to preserve this advantage.

                                                       Retrospect.

     I confess I found it a great temptation to review, however imperfectly, the
history and fortunes of our subject while it belonged to Section D. But to have
done so would have been practically to have written the history of botany in this
country since the first third of the century. Yet I cannot pass over some few

striking events.

     I think that the earliest of these must undoubtedly be regarded as the most
epoch-making. I mean the formal publication by the Linnean Society, in 1833,
of the first description of 'the nucleus of the cell,' by Robert Brown.' It seems

                     ' Msc. Bot. Works, i. 512.
               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                   837

difficult to realise that this may he within the recollection of some who are now

living amongst us. It is, however, of peculiar interest to me that the first person

who actually distinguished this all-important body, and indicated it in a figure,

was Francis Bauer, thirty years earlier, in 1802. This remarkahle man, whose

skill in applying the resources of art to the illustration of plant anatomy has never,

I suppose, been surpassed, was ' resident draughtsman for fifty years to the Royal

Botanic Garden at Kew.' And it was at Kew, and in a tropical orchid, Phaius

grandifolius, no doubt grown there, that the discovery was made.

It was, [ confess, with no little admiration that, on refreshing my memory by a

reference to Robert Brown's paper, I read again the vivid account which he gives

in a footnote of the phenomena, so painfully familiar to many of us who have been

teachers, exhibited in the staminal hair of Tradescantia. Sir Joseph Hooker > has

well remarked that ' the supreme importance of this observation, . . . leading to

undreamt-of conceptions of the fundamental phenomena of organic life, is acknow-

ledged by all investigators.' It is singular that so profound an observer as Robert

Brown should have himself missed the significance of what he saw. The world

had to wait for the discovery of protoplasm by Von Mohl till 1846, and till 1850

for its identification with the sarcode of zoologists by Cohn, who is still, I am
happy to say, living and at work, and to whom last year the Linnean Society did

itself the honour of presenting its medal.

The Edinburgh meeting of the Association, in 1834, was the occasion of the

announcement of another memorable discovery of Robert Brown's. I will content

myself with quoting Hofmeister's ^ account of it. ' Robert Brown was the dis-

coverer of the polyembrony of the Coniferce. In a later treatise he pointed out the

origin of the pro-embryo in large cells of the endosperm, to which he gave the

name ofcorpuscula.' The period of the forties, just half a century ago, looks in the

retrospect as one of almost dazzling discovery. To say nothing of the formal ap-

pearance of protoplasm on the scene, the foundations were being laid in all direc-

tions of our modern botanical morphology. Yet its contemporaries viewed it with
a very philosophical calm. Thwaites, who regarded Carpenter as his master,

described at the Oxford meeting in 1847 the conjugation of the Diatomace(B, and

' distinctly indicated,' as Carpenter^ says, ' that conjugation is the primitive phase

of sexual reproduction.' Berkeley informed me that the announcement fell per-
Afectly flat.
               year or two later Suminski came to London with his splendid

discovery (1848) of the archegonia of the fern, the antheridia having been

first seen by Niigeli in 1844. Carpenter * gave me, many years after, a curious

account of its reception. ' At the Council of the Ray Society, at which,'

he said, 'I advocated the reproduction of Suminski's book on the "Ferns," I
was assured that the close resemblance of the antherozoids to spermatozoa

was quite sufiicient proof that they could have nothing to do with vegetable

-- --reproduction. ' I do not think,' he added and the complaint is pathetic ' that

the men of the present generation, who have been brought up in the light, quite

apprehend (in this as in other matters) the utter darkness in which we were then

groping, or fully recognise the deserts of those who helped them to what they now

enjoy.' This was in 1875, and I suppose is not likely to be less true now.

The Oxford Meeting in 1860 was the scene of the memorable debate on the

origin of species, at which it is interesting to remember that Henslow presided.

DOn that occasion Section reached its meridian. The battle was Homeric. How-

ever little to the taste of its author, the launching of his great theory was, at any

rate, dignified with a not inconsiderable explosion. It may be that it is not given
to the men of our day to ruffle the dull level of public placidity with disturbing

and far-reaching ideas. But if it were, I doubt whether we have, or need now,

the tierce energy which inspired then either the attack or the defence. When we

met again in Oxford last year the champion of the old conflict stood in the place of

Wehonour, acclaimed of all men, a beautiful and venerable figure.  did not know

then that that was to be his farewell.

The battle was not in vain. Six years afterwards, at Nottingham, Sir Joseph

Hooker delivered his classical lecture on Insular Floras. It implicitly accepted
the new doctrine, and applied it with admirable effect to a field which had long
waited for an illuminating principle. The lecture itself has since remained one of

the corner-stones of that rational theory of the geographical distribution of plants

which may, I think, be claimed fairly as of purely English origin.

                                                    Henslow.

    Addressing you as I do at Ipswich, there is one name written in the annals of

--our old Section which I cannot pass over that of Ilenslow. He was the Secretary

of the Biological Section at its tirst meeting in 1832, and its President at Bristol in

1836. I suppose there are few men of this century who have indirectly more
influenced the current of human thought. For in great measure I think it will not
be contested that we owe Darwin to him. As Romanes has told us : ' ' His letters

written to Professor Ilenslow during his voyage round the world overflow with
feelings of affection, veneration, and obligation to his accomplished master and

--dearest friend feelings which throughout his life he retained with no diminished

intensity. As he used himself to say, before he knew Professor Henslow the only

objects he cared for were foxes and partridges.' I do not wish to overstate the
facts. The possession of 'the collector's instinct, strong in Darwin from his

childhood, as is usually the case in great naturalists,' to use Huxley's'- words,
would have borne its usual fruit in after life, in some shape or other, even if

Darwin had not fallen into Henslow's hands. But then the particular train of
events wliich culminated in the great work of his life would never have been
started. It appeared to me, then, that it would not be an altogether uninteresting
investigation to ascertain something about Henslow himself. The result has been

to provide me with several texts, which I think it may be not unprofitable to

dwell upon on the present occasion.

    In the first place, what was the secret of his influence over Darwin ? 'My

dear old master in Natural History ' (' Life,' ii. 317) he calls him ; and to have stood
in this relation to Darwin ^ is no small matter. Again, he speaks of his friendship

with him as ' a circumstance which influenced my whole career more than any

other ' (i. 52). The singular beauty of Henslow's character, to which Darwin
himself bore noble testimony, would count for something, but it would not in
itself be a sufficient explanation. Nor was it that intellectual fascination which
often binds pupils to the master's feet ; for, as Darwin tells us, ' I do not suppose
that anyone would say that he possessed much original genius ' (i. 52). The real

attraction seems to me to be found in Henslow's possession, in an extraordinary
degree, of what may be called the Natural History spirit. This resolves itself

into keen observation and a lively interest in the facts observed. ' His strongest

taste was to draw conclusions from long-continued minute observations ' (i. 52).
The old Natural History method, of which it seems to me that Henslow was
so striking an embodiment, is now, and I think unhappily, almost a thing of the
past. The modern university student of botany puts his elders to blush by his
minute knowdedge of some small point in vegetable histology. But he can tell
you little of the contents of a country hedgerow ; and if you put an unfamiliar
plant in his hands he is pretty much at a loss how to set about recognising its
affinities. Disdaining the field of nature spread at his feet in his own country, he

either seeks salvation in a German laboratory or hurries oft" to the Tropics, con-
vinced that he will at once immortalise himself. But ' cwlinn non anhnwm mvtat ;
he puts into ' pickle ' the same objects as his predecessors, never to be looked at
again ; or perhaps writes a paper on some obvious phenomena which he could
have studied with less fatigue in the Palm House at Kew.

     The secret of the right use of travel is the possession of the Natural History
instinct, and to those who contemplate it I can only recommend a careful study of

Darwin's ' Naturalist's Voyage.' Nothing that came in his way seems to have

' Memorial Notices, 13.      " Proc. R.S., xliv. vi.

the references in the text.

evaded him or to have seemed too inconsiderable for attention. No douht some

respectable travellers have lost themselves in a maze of observations that have led
to nothing. But the example of Darwin, and I might add of Wallace, of Huxley,

and of Moseley, show that that result is the fault of the man and not of the
method. The right moment comes when the fruitful opportunity arrives to him
who can seize it. The first strain of the prelude -with which the ' Origin ' com-
mences are these words: ' When on board H.M.S. " Beagle " as naturalist, I was
much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting
South America.' But this sort of vein is not struck at hazard or by him who has

not served a tolerably long apprenticeship to the work.

    When one reads and re-reads the ' Voyage,' it is simply amazing to see how much

could be achieved with a previous training which we now should think ludicrously

inadequate. Before Henslow's time the state of the natural sciences at Cambridge

was incredible. In fact, Leonard Jenyns,^ his biographer, speaks of the ' utter

disregard paid to Natural History in the University previous to his taking up his
residence there.' The Professor of Botany had delivered no lectures for thirty
3'ears, and though Sir James Smith, the founder of the Linnean Society, had

offered his services, tliey were declined on the ground of his being a Noncon-

formist.^

     As to Henslow's own scientific work, I can but rely on the judgment of those
who could appreciate it in relation to its time. According to Berkeley,^ ' he was

certainly one of the first, if not the very first, to see that two forms of fruit might

exist in the same fungus.' And this, as we now know, was a fundamental
advance in this branch of morphology. Sir Joseph Hooker tells me that bis papers

were all distinctly in advance of his day. Before occupying the chair of botany,
he held for some years that of mineralogy. Probably he owed this to his paper
on the Isle of Anglesey, published when he was only twenty-six. I learn from
the same authority that this to some extent anticipated, but at any rate strongly
influenced, Sedgwick's subsequent work in the same region.

                BOTANIC.\.L TeACHIITG.

Henslow's method of teaching deserves study. Darwin says of his lectures

' that he liked them much for their extreme clearness.' ' But,' he adds, * I did

not study botany ' (i. 48). Yet we must not take this too seriously. Darwin,*

when at the Galapagos, ' indiscriminately collected everything in flower on the

myditi^ereut islands, and fortunately kept  collections separate.' Fortunately

indeed ; for it was the results extracted from these collections, when worked up

subsequently by Sir Joseph Hooker, which determined the main work of his life.

' It was .such cases as that of the Galapagos Archipelago which chiefly led me to

study the origin of species ' (iii. 169).

Henslow's actual method of teaching went some way to anticipate the practical

methods of which we are all so proud. ' He was the first to introduce into the

botanical examination for degrees in London the system of practical examination.' *

But there was a direct simplicity about his class arrangements characteristic of the

Aman. ' large number of specimens . . . were placed in baskets on a side-table

in the lecture-room, with a number of wooden plates and other requisites for

dissecting them after a rough fashion, each student providing himself with what

he wanted before taking his seat.'" I do not doubt that the results were, in their

way, as efficient as we obtain now in more stately laboratories.

The most interesting feature about his teaching wos not, however, its academic

aspect, but the use he made of botany as a general educational instrument. ' He
always held that a man of no powers of observation was quite an exception.' ' He

thought (and I think he proved) that botany might be used ' for strengthening the

observant faculties and expanding the reasoning powers of children in all classes

of society.' *" The difficulty with which those who undertake now to teach our

subject have to deal is that most people ask the question, What is the use of

learning botany unless one means to be a botanist ? It might indeed be replied
that as the vast majority of people never learn anything efl'ectively, they might as-
well try botany as anything else. But Henslow looked only to the mental disci-

pline ; and it was characteristic of the man and of his belief in his methods that
when he was summoned to Court to lecture to the Royal family, his lectures.
' were, in all respects, identical with those he was in the habit of giving to hi»
little Hitcbam scholars ';^ and it must be added that they were not less successful.

     This success naturally attracted attention. Botanical teaching in schools was
taken up by the Government, and continues to receive support to the present day.

But the primitive spirit has, I am afraid, evaporated. Tlie measurement of results-

by means of examination has been fatal to its survival. The teacher has to keep
steadily before his eyes the necessity of earning his grant. The educational pro-
blem retires into the background. ' The strengthening of the observant faculties,'
and the rest of the Ilenslowian programme must give way to the imperious neces-
sity of presenting to the examiner candidates equipped with at least the minimum
of text-book formulas reproducible on paper. I do not speak in this matter with-
out painful experience. The most astute examiner is defeated by the still more
astute crammer. The objective basis of the study on which its whole usefulness
is built up is promptly thrown aside. If you supply the apple blossom for actual
description, you are as likely as not to be furnished with a detailed account of a
buttercup. The training of observation has gone by the board, and the exercise of
mere memory has taken its place. But a table of logarithms or a Hebrew gram-
mar would serve this purpose equally well. Yet I do not despair of Henslow's
work still bearing fruit. The examination system will collapse from the sheer im-
possibility of carrying it on beyond a certain point. Freed from its trammels, the
teacher will have greater scope for individuality, and the result of his labours will

be rewarded after some intelligent system of inspection. And here I may claim

--support from an unexpected quarter. Mr. Gladstone has recently written to a

correspondent : ' I think that the neglect of natural history, in all its multitude
of branches, was the grossest defect of our old system of training for the young

and, further, that little or nothing has been done by way of remedy for that
defect in the attempts made to alter or reform that system.' I am sure that the

importance and weight of this testimony, coming as it does from one whose training-
and sympathies have always been literary, cannot be denied. That there is already-
some revival of Henslow's methods, I judge from the fact that I have received ap-
plications from Board schools, amounting to some hundreds, for sui-plus specimens

from the Kew museums. "Without a special machinery for the purpose I cannot do'
much, and perhaps it is well. But my staff have willingly done what was possible,,

and from the letters I have received I gather that the labour has not been wholly

misspent.

                                    Museum Aebangement.

    This leads me to the last branch of Henslow's scientific work on which I anj

able to touch, that of the arrangement of museums, especially those which
being local have little meaning unless their purpose is strictly educational. I
think it is now generallj^ admitted that, both iu the larger and narrower aspects of
the question, his ideas, which were shared in some measure by Edward Forbes,

were not merely far in advance of his time, but were essentially sound. And here

I cannot help remarking that the zoologists have perhaps profited more by his

teaching than the botanists. I do not know how far Sir William Flower and Pro-

myfessor Lankester would admit the influence of Henslow's ideas. But, so far as
knowledge goes, I am not aware that, at any rate in Europe, there is anything to-

be seen in public museums comparable to the educational work accomplished by
the one at the College of Surgeons and the Natural History Museum, and by the

other at Oxford.

    I have often thought it singular that in botany we have not kept pace in this

matter with our brother naturalists. I do not doubt that vegetable morphology-

carefully arranged museum. The most successful and, indeed, almost the only

attempt which has been made in this direction is that at Cambridge, which, I

believe, is due to Mr. Gardiner. But our technical methods for preserving speci-

mens still leave much to desire. Something more satisfactory will, it may be

hoped, some day be devised, and the whole subject is one which is well worth the

careful consideration of our Section. Henslow at least effected a vast improve-

ment in the mode of displaying botanical objects                                                                                                                                                                                          and  a collection prepared by his-

admiration of the French botanists, who always appreciate the clear illustration of

morphological facts.

                      Old School of Natubal Histoet,

     If the old school of natural history of which Henslow in his day was a living

spirit is at present, as seems to be the case, continually losing its hold upon us,,

this has certainly not been due to its want of value as an educational discipline, or
to its sterility in contributing new ideas to human knowledge. Darwin's ' Origin

of Species ' may certainly be regarded as its offspring, and of this Huxley ' says

with justice : ' It is doubtful if any single book, except the " Principia," ever

worked so great and rapid a revolution in science, or made so deep an impression

on the general mind.' Yet Darwin's biographer, in that admirable Life which ranks

with the few really great biographies in our language, remarks (i. 165) : * In reading

his books one is reminded of the older naturalists rather than of the modern school

of writers. He was a naturalist in the old sense of the word, that is, a man who-
works at many branches of science, not merely a specialist in one.' This is no

doubt true, but does not exactly hit off the distinction between the kind of study
which has gone out of fashion and that which has come in. The older workers
in biology were occupied mainly with the external or, at any rate, grosser features

of organisms and their relation to surrounding conditions ; the modern, on the-

other hand, are engaged on the study of internal and intimate structure. Work in

the laboratory, with its necessary limitations, takes the place of research in the-

field. One may almost, in fact, say that the use of the compound microscope divides-
the two classes. Asa Gray has compared Robert Brown with Darwin as the * two
British naturaUsts ' who have, ' more than any others, impressed their influence-

upon science in the nineteenth century.' - Now it is noteworthy that Robert
Brown did all his work with a simple microscope. And Francis Darwin writes of

his father : ' It strikes us nowadays as extraordinary that he should have had no-
compound microscope when he went his "Beagle " voyage ; but in this he followed.

the advice of Robert Brown, who was an authority on such matters ' (i. 145). One-
often meets with persons, and sometimes of no small eminence, who speak as if there-
were some necessary antagonism between the old and the new studies. Thus I

have heard a distinguished systematist describe the microscope as a curse, and a
no less distinguished morphologist speak of a herbarium having its proper place on a

bonfire. To me I confess this anathematisation of the instruments of research proper
to any branch of our subject is not easily intelligible. Yet in the case of Darwin
himself it is certain that if his earlier work may be said to rest solely on the older-

methods, his later researches take their place with the work of the new schooL
At our last meeting Pfeft'er vindicated one of his latest and most important

observations.

    The case of Robert Brown is even more striking. He is equally great whether
we class him with the older or the modern school. In fact, so far as botany in
this country is concerned, he may be regarded as the founder of the latter. It is-
to him that we owe the establishment of the structure of the ovule and its develop-

ment into the seed. Even more important were the discoveries to which I have-
already referred, which ultimately led to the establishment of the group of Gymno-
sperms. 'No more important discovery,' says Sachs,^ 'was ever made in the
domain of comparative morphology and systematic botany. The first steps towards-
this result, which was clearly brought out by Hofmeister twenty-five years later^

were secured by Robert Brown's researcbes, and he was incidentally led to these
researches by some difficulties in the construction of the seed of an Australian genus.'

Yet it may be remembered that he began his career as naturalist to Flinders's
expedition for the exploration of Australia. He returned to England with 4,000
' for the most part new species of plants.' And these have formed the foundation

of our knowledge of the flora of that continent. Brown's chief work was done
between 1820 and 1840, and, as Sachs ' tells us, ' was better appreciated during
that time in Germany than in any other country.'

                          MoDERy SCHOOI.

The real founder of the modern teaching in this country in both branches of

biology I cannot doubt was Carpenter. The first edition of his admirable ' Prin-

ciples of Comparative Physiology ' was published in 1838, the last in 1854. All

who owe, as I do, a deep debt of gratitude to that book will agree with Huxley "

in regarding it as 'by far the best general survey of the whole field of life and of

the broad principles of biology which had been produced up to the time of its pub-

lication. Indeed,' he adds, ' although the fourth edition is now in many respects

out of date, I do not know its equal for breadth of view, sobriety of speculation,

and accuracy of detail.'

The charm of a wide and philosophic survej' of the different forms under which

life presents itself could not but attract the attention of teachers. Kolleston elabo-

rated a course of instruction in zoology at Oxford in which the structures described in

the lecture-room were subsequently worked out in the laboratory. In 1872 Huxley

organised the memorable course in elementary biology at South Kensington which

has since, in its essential features, been adopted throughout the country. In the

following year, during Huxley's absence abroad through ill-health, I arranged, at

his request, a course of instruction on the same lines for the Vegetable Kingdom.

That the development of the new teaching was inevitable can hardly be doubted,

myand I for  part am not disposed to regret the share I took in it.  But it was

not obvious, and certainly it was not expected, that it would to so lai'ge an extent-

cut the ground from under the feet of the old Natural History studies. The conse-

quences are rather serious, and I think it is worth while pointing them out.

    In a vast empire )ike our own there is a good deal of work to be done and a
good many posts to be filled, for which the old Natural History training was not

merely a useful but even a necessary preparation. But at the present time the univer-

sities almost entirely fail to supply men suited to the work. They neither care to

collect, nor have they the skilled aptitude for observation. Then, though this

country is possessed at home of incomparable stores of accumulated material, the

class of competent amateurs who were mostly trained at our universities and
who did such good service in working that material out is fast disappearing. It
may not be easy indeed in the future to fill important posts even in this country with
men possessing the necessary qualifications. But there was still another source of

naturalists, even more useful, which has practically dried up. It is an interesting

fact that the large majority of men of the last generation who have won dis-

tinction in this field have begun their career with the study of medicine. That the

kind of training that Natural History studies give is of advantage to students of

medicine which, rightly regarded, is itself a Natural History study, can hardly

be denied. But the exigencies of the medical curriculum have crowded them out,

and this, I am afraid, must be accepted as irremediable. I cannot refrain from

reading you, on this point, an extract from a letter which I have received from a

distinguished official lately entrusted with an important foreign mission. I should

add that he had himself been trained in the old way.

    ' I have had my time, and must leave to younger men the delight of working

these interesting fields. Such chances never will occur again, for roads are now

being made and ways cut in the jungle and forest, and you have at hand all sorts of

trees level on the ground ready for study. These bring down with them orchids, ferns,

and climbers of many kinds, including rattan palms, &c. But, excellent as are the
officers who devote their energy to thus opening up this country, there is not one

doctor nowadays cares for no living thing larger or more complicated than a

bacteriuvi or a bacillus.^

     But there are other and even more serious grounds why the present dominance

of one aspect of our subject is a matter for regret. In the concluding chapter of

--the ' Origin,' Darwin wrote : ' I look with confidence to the future to young and

rising naturalists.' But I observe that most of the new writers on the Darwinian
theory, and, oddly enough, especially when they have been trained at Cambridge,
generally begin by more or less rejecting it as a theory of the origin of species,
and then proceed unhesitatingly to reconstruct it. The attempt rarely seems to
me successful, perhaps because the limits of the laboratory are unfavourable to

the accumulation of the class of observations which are suitable for the

purpose. The laboratory, in fact, has not contributed much to the Darwinian

theory, except the ' Law of Recapitulation,' and that, I am told, is going out of

fashion.

     The Darwinian theory, being, as I have attempted to show, the outcome of the
Natural History method, rested at every point on a copious basis of fact and
observation. This more modern speculation lacks. The result is a revival of
transcendentalism. Of this we have had a copious crop in this country, but it is
quite put in the shade by that with which we have been supplied from America.
Perhaps the most remarkable feature is the persistent vitality of Lamarckism. As
Darwin remarks : ' Lamarck's one suggestion as to the cause of the gradual modifica-

-- --tion of species effort excited by change of conditions was, on the face of it,

inapplicable to the whole vegetable world ' (ii. 189). And if we fall back on

the inherited direct effect of change of conditions, though Darwin admits that

' physical conditions have a more direct effect on plants than on animals ' (ii. 319),

I have never been able to convince myself that that effect is inherited. I will
give one illustration. The difference in habit of even the same species of plant

when grown under mountain and lowland conditions is a matter of general obser-
vation. It would be difficult to imagine a case of ' acquired characters ' more
likely to be ' inherited.' But this does not seem to be the case. The recent careful
research of Gaston Bonnier only confirms the experience of cultivators. ' The
modifications acquired by the plant when transported for a definite time from the
plains to the Alps, or rice versa, disappear at the end of the same period when the

 plant is restored to its original conditions.'

      Darwin, in an eloquent passage, which is too long forme to quote,' has shown
how enormously the interest of Natural History is enhanced ' when we regard

every production of Nature as one which has had a long history,' and ' when we
contemplate every complex structure ... as the summing up of many con-

trivances.' But this can only be done, or at any rate begun, in the field and not in

the laboratory.

    A more serious peril is the dying out amongst us of two branches of botanical

study in which we have hitherto occupied a position of no small distinction.
Apart from the staffs of our official institutions, there seems to be no one who

either takes any interest in, or appreciates in the smallest degree, the importance of

.systematic and descriptive botany. And geographical distribution is almost in a

w^orse plight, yet Darwin calls it, ' that grand subject, that almost keystone of the

laws of creation ' (i. 356).

     I am aware that it is far easier to point out an evil than to remedy it. The

te.iching of botany at the present day has reached a pitch of excellence and
earnestness which it has never reached before. That it is somewhat one-sided

cannot probably be remedied without a subdivision of the subject and an increase
in the number of teachers. If it has a positive fault, it is that it is sometimes
inclined to be too dogmatic and deductive. Like Darwin, at any rate in a

biological matter, 'I never feel convinced by deduction, even in the case of

instead of making them tell their own stoiy,

I am afraid I have detained you too long over these matters, on which I must

admit I have spoken with some frankness. But I take it that one of the objects

all felt the advantage of these annual meetings, of the profitable discussion for-

mal and informal, and of the privilege of meeting so many of our foreign brethren

who have so generously supported us by their presence and sympathy.

    I am anxious, then, to suggest that we should conduct our proceedings on as
broad lines as possible. I do not think we should be too ready to encourage papers

which may well be communicated to societies, either local or central.

myThere Is one subject upon which, from       official position elsewhere, I desire

to take the opportunity of saying a few words. It is that of Nomenclature. It

myamis not on its technical side, I
                                 afraid, of sufficient general interest to justify

devoting to it the space which its importance would otherwise deserve. But I

hope to be able to enlist your support for the broad common- sense principles on

which our practice should rest.

    As I suppose, everyone knows we owe our present method of nomenclature in
natural history to Linnseus. He devised the binominal, or, as it is often absurdly

called, the binomial system. That we must have a technical system of nomencla-

ture I suppose no one here will dispute. It is not, however, always admitted by

popular writers who have not appreciated the difficulty of the matter, and who-

think all names should be in the vernacular. There is the obvious difficulty that

the vast majority of plants do not possess any names at all, and the attempts to

manufacture them in a popular shape have met with but little success. Then,

from lack of discriminating power on the part of those who use them, vernacular

names are often ambiguous ; thus Bullrush is applied equally to Typha and to

Scirpus, plants extremely dilferent. Vernacular names, again, are only of local

utility, while the Linneau system is Intelligible throughout the world.

   A technical name, then, for a plant or animal is wea necessltj', as without it

cannot fix the object of our investigations into its affinity, structure, or properties."^

' Nomina si nescis perit et cognitlo rerum.'

In order to get clear ideas on the matter let us look at the logical principles on

which such names are based. It is fortunate for us that these are stated by Mill,

who, besides being an authority on logic, was also an accomplished botanist. He

'Atells us : ^  naturalist, for purposes connected with his particular science, sees

reason to distribute the animal or vegetable creation into certain groups rather

than into any others, and he requires a name to bind, as it were, each of his groups

together.' He further explains that such names, whether of species, genera, or

orders, are what logicians call connotative : they denote the members of each group,

Aand comiote the distinctive characters by which it is defined.  species, then, con-

notes the common characters of the individuals belonging to it ; a genus, those of

the species ; an order, those of the genera.

' Linn. Phil., 210.                           ^ Si/stem of Logic, i. 132.

     But these are the logical principles, -which are applicable to names generally.

A name such as Ranunculus repem does not diHer in any particular from a name

such as John Smith, except that one denotes a species, the other an individual.
     This being the case, and technical names being a necessity, they continually

pass into general use in connection with horticulture, commerce, medicine, and the

arts. It seems obvious that, if science is to keep in touch with human affairs,
stability in nomenclature is a thing not merely to aim at but to respect. Changes

become necessary, but should never be insisted on without grave and solid reason.

In some cases they are inevitable unless the taxonomic side of botany is to remain at a
standstill. From'time to time the revision of a large group has to be undertaken from
a uniform and comparative point of view. It then often occurs that new genera
are seen to have been too hastily founded on insufficient grounds, and must therefore

be merged in others. This may involve the creation of a large number of new

names, the old ones becoming henceforth a burden to literature as synonyms. It

is usual in such cases to retain the specific portion of the original name, if possible.

If it is, however, already preoccupied in the genus to which the transference is

made, a new one must be devised. Many modern systematists have, however, set

up the doctrine that a specific epithet once given is indelible, and whatever the

taxonomic wanderings of the organism to which it was once assigned, it must

always accompany it. This, however, would not have met with much sympathy
                                                                                              ' Nomen

specificum sine generico est quasi pistillum sine campana.' ' Linnfeus always had a

solid reason for everything he did or said, and it is worth while considering in this

case what it was.
     Before his time the practice of associating plants in genera had made some

progress in the hands of Tournefort and others, but specific names were still cum-
brous and practically unusable. Genera were often distinguished by a single word ;

and it was the great reform accomplished by Linnaeus to adopt the binominal principle
for species. But there is this difference. Generic names are unique, and must not

be applied to more than one distinct group. Specific names migtit have been con-

stituted on the same basis ; the specific name in that case would then have never

been used to designate more than one plant, and would have been sufficient to

Weindicate it.  should have lost, it is true, the useful information which we get

     It constantly happens that the same species is named and described by more
than one writer, or different views are taken of specific differences by various
writers ; the species of one are therefore ' lumped ' by another. In such cases,
where there is a choice of names, it is customary to select the earliest published.
I agree, however, with the late Sereno Watson * that ' there is nothing whatever
of an ethical character inherent in a name, through any priority of publication or
position, which should render it morally obligatory upon anyone to accept one name
rather than another.' And in point of fact Linnseus and the early systematists

attached little importance to priority. The rigid application of the principle
involves the assumption that all persons who describe or attempt to describe plants

in the combination, not in the specific epithet, which is a mere fragment of the name,

are equally competent to the task. But this is so far from beingf the case that it is

sometimes all but impossible even to guess -what could possibly have been meant.^

     In 1872 Sir Joseph Hooker ^ wrote : ' The number of species described by authors

who cannot determine their affinities increases annually, and I regard the naturalist
who puts a described plant into its proper position in regard to its allies as render-

ing a greater service to science than its describer when he either puts it into

a wrong place or throws it into any of those chaotic heaps, miscalled genera, with

which systematic works still abound.' This has always seemed to me not merely
sound sense, but a scientific way of treating the matter. What we want in
nomenclature is the maximum amount of stability and the minimum amount of

change compatible with progress in perfecting our taxonomic system. Nomencla-

ture is a means, not an end. There are perhaps 150,000 species of flowering plants

in existence. What we want to do is to push on the task of getting them named

and described in an intelligible manner, and their affinities determined as correctly

Weas possible.  shall then have material for dealing with the larger problems

which the vegetation of our globe will present when treated as a whole. To me

the botanists who waste their time over priority are like boys who, when sent on
an errand, spend their time in playing by the roadside. By such men even

Linnteus is not to be allowed to decide his own names. To one of the most

· splendid ornaments of our gardens he gave the name of Magnolia grandijlora :
  this is now to be known as Magnolia foefida. The reformer himself is constrained

to admit, ' The change is a most unfortunate one in every way.' ^ It is diffi-

cult to see what is gained by making it, except to render systematic botany

ridiculous. The genus Aspidium, known to every fern-cultivator, was founded by

Swartz. It now contains some 400 species, of which the vast majority were of

course unknown to him at the time yet the names of all these are to be changed
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

because Adanson founded a genus, Drgopteris, which seems to be the same thing

as Aspidium. What, it may be asked, is gained by the change ? To science

it is certainly nothing. On the other hand, we lumber our books with a mass

of synonyms, and perplex everyone who takes an interest in ferns. It appears that

the name of the well-known Australian genus Banksia really belongs to Pimelea ;

the species are therefore to be renamed, and Banksia is to be rechristened

Sirmuellera, after Sir Ferdinand von Mueller ; a proposal which, I need hardly say,

did not emanate from an Englishman.

I will not multiply instances. But the worst of it is that those who have

carefully studied the subject know that, from various causes which I cannot

afford the time to discuss, when once it is attempted to disturb accepted nomen-

clature, it is almost impossible to reach finality. Many genera only exist by virtue

of their redefinition in modern times ; in the form in which they were originally
promulgated they have hardly any intelligible meaning at all.

It can hardly be doubted that one cause of the want of attention which

systematic botany now receives is the repulsive labour of the bibliographical work

with which it has been overlaid. What an enormous bulk nomenclature has

already attained may be judged from the Index Ketvensis, which was prepared at

Kew, and which we owe to the munificence of Mr. Darwin. In his own studies he

constantly came on the track of names which he was unable to run down to their

source. This the Index enables to be done. It is based, in fact, on a manuscript

index which we compiled for our own use at Kew. But it is a mistake to suppose

that it is anything more than the name signifies, or that it expresses any opinion

as to the validity of the names themselves. That those who use the book must

to the burden by making any new ones for species already described.
    What synonymy has now come to may be judged by an example supplied me

published names under six genera. If we go on in this way we shall have to
invent a new Linnaeus, wipe out the past, and begin all over again.

     Although I have brought the matter before the Section, it is not one in which
this, or indeed any collective assembly of botanists, can do very much. While I
hope I shall carry your assent with the general principles I have laid down, it must
be admitted that the technical details can only be appreciated by experienced
specialists. All that can be hoped is a general agreement amongst the staffs of the
principal institutions in different countries where systematic botany is worked at
the free-lances must be left to do as they like.

                                                           Ptjblications.

    I have dwelt at such length on certain aspects of my subject that perhaps,
without great injustice, you may retort on me the complaint of one-sidedness.

But when I survey the larger field of botany in this country, the prospect

seems to me so vast that I should despair even if I had my whole address
myat disposal of doing it justice. I think that its extent is measured by the way in

which the publications belonging to our subject are maintained. First of all,

we have access to the Royal Society, a privilege of which I hope we shall

always continue to take advantage for communications which either treat of

fundamental subjects, or at least are of general interest to biologists. Ne.xt to

this we have our ancient Linnean Society, with a branch of its publications hand-
somely and efficiently devoted to systematic work. Then we have the ' Annals of
Botany,' which has now, I think, established its position, and which brings together
the chief morphological and physiological work accomplished in the country. Lastly,
we have the ' Journal of Botany,' a less ambitious but useful periodical, which is

mainly devoted to the labours of British botanists. I remember there was a time
when I thought that this, at any rate, was an exhausted field. But it is not so

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

knowledge in its most limited aspects is inexhaustible if the labourer have the
necessary insight. The discoveries of Mr. Arthur Bennett amongst the potamogetons

of the Eastern Counties is a striking and brilliant instance.

    Besides the publication of the ' Annals ' we owe to the Oxford Press a splendid
aeries of the best foreign text-books issued in our own language. If the thouo-ht
has sometimes occurred to one's mind that we were borrowers too freely from our

indefatigable neighbours, I, at least, remember that the late Professor Eichler
paid us the compliment of saying that he preferred to read one of these monumental
books in the Enghsh translation rather than in the original. I believe it is no
secret that botany owes the aid that Oxford has rendered it in these and

other matters in great measure to my old friend the Master of Pembroke College,
than whom I believe science has no more devoted supporter.

                                                Paleobotany.

    I have said much of recent botany ; I must not pass over that of past ages.

Two notable workers in this field have passed away since our last meetmg.
Saporta was with us at Manchester, and we shall not. readily forget his personal

charm. If some of his work has about it a too imaginative character, the
patience and entire sincerity with which he traced the origin of the existing forms
of vegetation in Southern Europe to their ancestors in the not distant geological
past willalways deserve attentive study. But in the venerable, yet always youth-

ful, Wilhamaon we lose a figure whose memory we shall long preserve. With

rare instinct he accumulated a wealth of material illustrative of the vegetation of

the Carboniferous epoch, which, I suppose, is unique in the world. And this was
prepared for examination with incomparable patience either by his own hands or
under his own eyes. He illustrated it with absolute fidelity. And if he did not
in describing it always use language with which we could agree, nothing could

ruffle either his imperturbable good nature or the noble simplicity of his character.

Truth to tell, we were often in friendly warfare with him. But I rejoice to think
that before his peaceful end came he had patiently reconsidered and' abandoned aU
that we regarded as his heresies, but which were, in truth, only the old manner of
        !

looking at things. And I think that if anything could have contributed to make his

departure happy, it was the conviction that the completion of his work and his
·scientific reputation would remain perfectly secure in the hands of Dr. Scott.

                                Vegetable Phtsiologt.

Turning again to the present, the difficulty is to limit the choice of topics

on which I would willingly dwell. In an address which 1 delivered at the Bath

meeting in 1888 I ventured to point out the important part which the action of

enzymes would be found to play in plant metabolism. My expectations have

been more than realised by the admirable work of Professor Green on the one

hand, and of Mr. Horace Brown on the other. The wildest imagination could not

have foreseen the developments which in the hands of animal physiologists would

spring from the study of the fermentative changes produced by yeast and bacteria.

These, it seems to me, bid fair to revolutionise our whole conceptions of disease.

The reciprocal action of ferments, developed in so admirable a manner by Marshall
Ward in the case of the ginger-beer plant, is destined, I am convinced, to an expan-

.sion scarcely less important.

     But, perhaps, the most noteworthy feature in recent work is the disposition to

reopen in every direction fundamental questions. And here, I think, we may take

-a useful lesson from the practice of the older Sections, and adopt the plan of entrust-

ing the investigation of special problems to small committees, or to individuals who

are willing to undertake the labour of reporting upon special questions which they

have made peculiarly their own. These reports would be printed in extenso, and

are capable of rendering invaluable service by making accessible acquired know-

ledge which could not be got at in any other way.

    We owe to Mr. Blackman a masterly demonstration of the fact, long believed,

l3ut never, perhaps, properly proved, that the surface of plants is ordinarily imper-

meable to gases. Mr. Dixon has brought forward some new views about water-

movement in plants, which I confess I found less instructive than many of my

brother botanists. They are expressed in language of extreme technicality; but,

as far as I understand them, they amount to this. The water moving in the plant

is contained in capillary channels ; as it evaporates at the surface of the leaves a

tensile strain is setup, as long as the columns are not broken, to restore the original

level. I can understand that in this way the ' transpiration current ' may be
maintained. But what I want to know is how this explains the phenomena in the

sugar maple, a single tree of which will yield, I believe, 20-30 gallons of fluid

before a single leaf is expanded.

   We owe to Messrs. Darwin and Acton the supply of a 'Manual of Practical

Vegetable Physiology,' the want of which has long been keenly felt. Like the

father of one of the authors, ' I love to exalt plants ' (i. 98). 1 have long been

satisfied that the facts of vegetable physiology are capable of being widely taught,

and are not less significant and infinitely more convenient than most of those

Howwhich can be easily demonstrated on the animal side.           little any accurate

knowledge of the subject has extended was conspicuously demonstrated in a recent

discussion at the Royal Society, when two of our foremost chemists roundly denied

the existence of a function of respiration in plants, because it was unknown to

Liebig

                                Assimilation.

The greatest and most fundamental problem of all is that of assimilation. The

made some remarkable researches, which were communicated to the Royal Society

in 1 889, on the extent to which plants could take advantage of organic compounds

made, so to speak, ready to their hand. Loew, in a remarkable paper, which wUl

perhaps attract less attention than it deserves from being published in Japan,' has,

            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                                                                                                                               849

from the study of the nutrition of bacteria, arrived at some general conclusions in

the same direction. Bokorny appears recently to have similarly experimented on

algae. Neither writer, however, seems to have been acquainted with Acton's work.

The general conclusion which I draw from Loew is to strengthen the belief that

form-aldehyde is actually one of the first steps of organic synthesis, as long ago

suggested by Adolph Baeyer. Plants, then, will avail themselves of ready-made

organic compounds which will yield them this body. That a sugar can be con-

structed from it has long been known, and Bokorny has shown that this can be

utilised by plants in the production of starch.

The precise mode of the formation of form-aldehyde in the process of assimi-

lation is a matter of dispute. But it is quite clear that either the carbon dioxide

or the water, which are the materials from which it is formed, must suffer dissocia-

tion. And this requires a supply of energy to accomplish it. Warington has

drawn attention to the striking fact that in the case of the nitrifying bacterium,
assimilation may go on witliout the intervention of chlorophyll, the energy being

supplied by the oxidation of ammonia. This brings us down to the fact, which has

long been suspected, that protoplasm is at the bottom of the whole business, and

that chlorophyll only plays some subsidiary and indirect part, perhaps, as Adolph

Baeyer long ago suggested, of temporarily fixing carbon o.xide like haemoglobin, and

so facilitating the dissociation.

Chlorophyll itself is still the subject of the careful study by Dr. Schunck,

originally commenced by him some years ago at Kew. This will, I hope, give us

eventually an accurate insight into the chemical constitution of this important

substance.

The steps in plant metabolism which follow the synthesis of the proto-carbo-

hydrate are still obscure. Brown and Morris have arrived at the unexpected con-

clusion that ' cane-sugar is the first sugar to be synthesised by the assimilatory

processes.' I made some remarks upon this at the time,^ which I may be

permitted to reproduce here.

' The point of view arrived at by botanists was briefly stated by Sachs in the

case of the sugar-beet, starch in the leaf, glucose in the petiole, cane-sugar in the

root. The facts in the sugar-cane seem to be strictly comparable." Cane-sugar

Wethe botanist looks on, therefore, as a " reserve material."                                                                       may call " glucose ''

the sugar " currency " of the plant, cane-sugar its " banking reserve."

     ' The immediate result of the diastatic transformation of starch is not glucose,
but maltose. But Mr. Horace Brown has shown in his remarkable experiments

on ftjeding barley embryos that, while they can readily convert maltose into cane-

Wesugar, they altogether fail to do this with glucose.                                                                              may conclude, therefore,

that glucose is, from the point of view of vegetable nutrition, a somewhat inert
body. On the other hand, evidence is apparently wanting that maltose plays the

part in vegetable metabolism that might be expected of it. Its conversion into

glucose may be perhaps accounted for by the constant presence in plant tissues of

vegetable acids. But, so far, the change would seem to be positively disadvan-

tageous. Perhaps glucose, in the botanical sense, will prove to have a not very

exact chemical connotation.

     'That the connection between cane-sugar and starch is intimate is a conclusion

to which both the chemical and the botanical evidence seems to point. And on

botanical grounds this would seem to be equally true of its connection with

cellulose.

     ' It must be confessed that the conclusion that " cane-sugar " is the first sugar to
be synthesised by the assimilatory processes seems hard to reconcile with its

probable high chemical complexity, and with the fact that, botanically, it seems

to stand at the end and not at the beginning of the series of metabolic change.'

     The synthesis of proteids is the problem which is second only in importance to
that of carbohydrates. Loew's views of this deserve attentive study. Asparagin,
as has long been suspected, plays an important part. It lias, he says, two sources

in the plant. ' It may either be formed directly from glucose, ammonia (or nitrates)
and sulphates, or it may be a transitory product between protein-decomposition and

reconstructioQ from the fragments.'

    In the remarks I made to the Chemical Society I ventured to express my con-

viction that the chemical processes which took place under the influence of proto-

plasm were probably of a ditierent kind from those with which the chemist is ordinarily

occupied. The plant produces a profusion of substances, apparently with great

facility, which the chemist can only build up in the most circuitous way. As
Victor Meyer - has remarked : ' In order to isolate an organic substance we are

generally confined to the purely accidental properties of crystallisation and volatili-

sation.' In other words, the chemist only deals with bodies of great molecular

stability; while it cannot be doubted that those which play a part in the processes

of life are the very opposite in every respect. I am convinced that if the chemist

is to help in the field of protoplasmic activity, he will have to transcend his

present limitations, and be prepared to admit that as there may be more than one

algebra, there may be more than one chemistry. I am glad to see that a somewhat

similar idea has been suggested by other fields of inquiry. Professor Meldol a ^

thinks that the investigation of photochemical processes ' may lead to the recog-

nition of a new order of chemical attraction, or of the old chemical attraction in

a different degree.' I am delighted to see that the ideas which were floating,
I confess, in a very nebulous form in my brain are being clothed with greater

precision by Loew.

In the  paper which  I  have      already  quoted, he  says  of  proteids    *  ' They  are

                                                                           :

exceedingly lahil compounds that can be easily converted into relatively stable ones.

A great lability is the indispensable and necessary foundation for the production

·of the various actions of the living protoplasm, for the mode of motions that move

the life-machinery. There is a source of motioti in the labil position of atoms in

molecules, a source that has hitherto not been taken into consideration either by

chemists or by physicists.'
     But I must say no more. The problems to which I might invite attention on

an occasion like this are endless. I have not even attempted to do justice to the
work that has been accomplished amongst ourselves, full of interest and novelty
as it is. But I will venture to say this, that if capacity and earnestness afford an
augury of success, the prospects of the future of our Section possess every element

of promise.

1. On a False Bacterium. By Professor Marshall Ward, F.B.S.

     The author has isolated from the Thames a form which gives all the ordinary
reactions of a bacterium in plate-cultures and tube-cultures in gelatine, agar, potato,

broth, milk, &c.

     It is a rod-like form, 1 ft thick, and up to 2-4 fi long, stains like a bacillus,

and cannot be distinguished from a true Schizomycete by the methods in common

--use.
    On cultivating it under high powers one-twelfth and one-twentieth oil im-

--mersions from the single cell, however, it is found to form small, shortly branched

mycelia the growth and segmentation of which are acropetal. This turns out to be
a minute oidial form of a true fungus.

     Its true nature can only be ascertained by the isolation and culture through all
stages from the single cell, according to the original methods of gelatine cultures

of Klebs, Brefeld, and De Bary which preceded and suggested the methods em-

ployed by bacteriologists; and the facts discovered raise interesting questions as to
the character of alleged ' branching ' bacteria on the one hand, and the multiple
derivation of the heterogeneous group of micro-organisms, termed bacteria in general

on the other.

        2. On the Archesporium. By Professor F. O. Bower, F.R.S.

     Professor Bower pointed out that the recognition of the archesporium as con-

·sistently of hypoderiual origin cannot be upheld, and quoted as exceptions
Efjiiisetum, Isoetcg, Ophiof/lossum, and especially the leptosporangiate ferns. lie

ilaid down the general principle that the sporangia, as regards their development,

should be studied in the light of a knowledge of the apical meristems of the plants

in question. Where the apical meristems are stratified, the archesporium is hypo-

dermal in the usual sense ; where initial cells occur, the archesporium is derived by
periclinal divisions of superficial cells. Intermediate types of meristem show an

intermediate type of origin of the archesporium. He cited as an illustrative case

that of Ophioglossum, admitting that the hypodermal hand of potential arche-
sporium, which he had previously described, does not occur always or in all
species. But so far from thus giving up the case for a comparison with Lyco-
podium, he holds that as Ophiofflossum has a single initial cell in stem and root it
would be contrary to experience to expect or demand a hypodermal archesporium.

3. Rote on the Occurrence in Neio Zealand of two forms ofPeJtoid Trente-

Apohliacea;, and their relation to the Lichen Strigula. £y                                                                           Vaughan

Jennings, F.L.S., F.G.S.

     The Trentepohliacea3 which form epiphyllous cell-plates are at present known
only from the tropics (with the exception of two imperfectly developed forms in

the northern temperate zone). They have been recorded from S. America (Bornet),

India and Oeylon (the Mijcoidea parasitica of Cunningham and Marshall

Ward), and the East Indies (Karsten), bat not up to the present time from New

Zealand.

     The present paper gives a summary of previous literature, and describes two

forms found by the writer in New Zealand.

(1) Phycopeltis expansa (new species).--This species forms wide-spreading

yellow cell-plates on the leaves of Nesodaphne in the North Island (Rotorua), and
in the South Island (near Picton). Sporangia of two kinds : («) enlarcred cells of

the disc                                   {h) borne  singly  on                              a  hooked pedicel   supported  on  a single°basal    cell.
                                        ;

The plant is often associated with brown fungus byphse growino- between the cell-

rows, but not afl'ecting the growth of the alga. On the other hand, when attacked

by difi^rent hyphse, the result is the formation of the lichen Strigula, which in

Ceylon was shown by Ward to have for its algal element the Mycoidea parasitica,
Cunn.

(2) Phycopeltis nigra (new species).--The second form is found also on leaves
of Nesodaphne with the Phycopeltis above described, and alone on fronds of
Aspleniumfalcatum. Sporangia in the disc are present, but no trace of sporancna
on pedicels is observed.                                                                                                                           "^

The plant always forms narrow, radiating, and branching bands, never circular

discs : the margins often irregular and tending to break into filaments.

There are two distinct varieties : (a) a comparatively large-celled form with

barren hairs well                          developed                                          (6) a small-celled  type  entirely devoid of hairs.
                                                                                           ;

The most remarkable feature, however, is the colour. On the leaf the plant

appears perfectly black, and by transmitted light has the olive-green colour cha-
racteristic of many fungi, quite different from any of the ordinary Trentepohlias.
The plant is never attacked by fungus hyphre, and never takes any part in lichen
formation, even when on the same leaf with PhycojJeltis edpansa and the

associated Strigula.

                            FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13.

     The following Papers were read :

               1. Experimental Studies in the Variation of Yeast Cells.

                     By Dr. Emil Chr. Hanskn, Copenhagen.

     The author gave an account of his earlier and more recent investigations.

Among the latter he especially dwelt on those in which, by one treatment, varieties-

were produced that gave more, and by another treatment less, alcohol than their

parent cells. He pointed out that the observed variations could be grouped under
certain rules. From his researches on the agencies and causes to which variatiork

is due he found that temperature was the most influential external factor.'

2. On a New Form of Fructification in Sphenophyllum.
            By Graf Solms-Laubach, Strasshurg.

     Graf Solms gave a brief sketch of the history of our knowledge of the fructifi-

cation of the Carboniferous genus Sphenophyllum. He described the type of

strobilus orio-inally named by Williamson Volkmannia Dmcsoni, and subsequently

placed by Weiss in the genus Bowmanites ; this fructification has recently been
shown by Williamson and Zeiller to belong to Sphenophyllum. The author pro-

ceeded to give an account of a new form of strobilus recently obtained from rocks

of Culm ao'e in Silesia ; this shows certain important deviations from the fructifi-

cations previously examined. In the Sphenophyllum strobili from the Coal-

measures the axis bears successive verticils of coherent bracts, the sporangia are

borne singly at the end of long pedicils twice as numerous as the bracts, and

arising from the upper surface of the coherent disc near the axil. In the Culm

species, Sphenophyllum Romeri, sp. nov., the bracts of successive whorls are super-

posed and not alternate, as described by other writers, in the Coal-measure species j
a more important feature of the new form is the occurrence of two sporangia

instead of one in each sporangiophore or pedicil.

Graf Solms referred to the unique collection of microscopic preparations of

fossil plants left by Professor  Williamson                                                 he  emphasised  in  the  strongest  terma
                                                                                         ;

the immense importance of the collection, and pointed out how every worker in

the field of Palseozoic botany must constantly consult the invaluable type specimens

in the Williamson cabinets.

 3 The Chief Eesults of Williamson^s Work on the Carloniferous Plants.

                             By Dr. D. H. Scott, F.R.S.

     The origin and history of the late Professor Williamson's researches on the
Carboniferous flora were briefly traced. His great work, chiefly, though not
entirely, contained in his long series of memoirs in the 'Philosophical Transactions'
of the Royal Society, consisted in thoroughly elucidating the structure of British
fossil plants of the coal period, and thus determining, on a sound basis, the main

lines of their aflinities.

     Four of the principal types investigated by Williamson were selected for illus-

--tration the Calamariece, the Sphenophyllece, the Lyginodendrecs, and the Lycopo-

--diacece.
     (1) The Calamnrieo!. Williamson's great aim, which he kept in view all
through, was to demonstrate the essential unity of type of the British Calamites,
i.e. that they are all Cryptogams, of equisetaceous affinities (though sometimes
heterosporous), both possessing precisely the same mode of growth in thickness by
means of a cambium, which is now characteristic of Dicotyledons and Gymnosperms.

      ' For a fuller account of Dr. Hansen's work, sec the Annals of Botany, 1895.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  853

 His researches have given us a fairly complete knowledge of the organisation of

these arborescent Horse-tails.

      (2) The Sphenophylle(P, a remarkahle group of vascular Cryptogams, unrepre-
sented among living plants, but having certain characters in common both with
Lycopodiacece and Equisetacem, are now very thoroughly known, owing, in a great
degree, to Williamson's investigations. The discovery of the structure of the
fructification, absolutely unique among Cryptogams, was in the first instance

·entirely his own.

   --(3) The Lyginodendrea. The existence of this family, which consists of plants

with the foliage of ferns, but with stems and roots which recall those of Cycads,
was revealed by Williamson. This appears to be the most striking case of an
intermediate group yet found among fossil plants.

   --(4) The Lycopocliacea'. Williamson added enormously to our knowledge of

this great family, and proved conclusively that Sigillaria and Lepidodendron are

·essentially similar in structure, both genera, as well as their allies, being true

Lycopodiaceous Cryptogams, but with secondary growth in almost all cases. He

·demonstrated the relation between the vegetative organs and the fructification in

many of these plants, and by his researches on Stigmaria, made known the
structure of their subterranean parts. The different types of Lepidodendron, of

which he investigated the structure, were so numerous as to place our knowledge
of these plants on a broad and secure foundation. The paper was illustrated by
lantern-slides, partly from Williamson's figures, and partly original.

     4. The Localisation, the Transport, and Role of Hydrocyanic Acid in

       Pangium edule, Reinw. By Dr. T. M. Treub, Buitenzorg, Java.

      Five years ago Dr. Greshoff made the remarkable discovery that the poisonous
 substance contained in great quantities in all the parts of Pangium edule, was
 nothing else than hydrocyanic acid. This interesting chemical discovery was the

 starting-point of Dr. Treub's physiological investigations. In microchemical re-
 searches hydrocyanic acid presents a great advantage, as compared with the gi'eat
 majority of substances to be detected in tissues by reagents ; namely, that the
 Prussian blue reaction, easily applicable in microchemical research, gives completely

 trustworthy results. The appearance of Prussian blue in a cell may be accepted as

certain proof of the previous occurrence in the cell of hydrocyanic acid, no other
 substance producing the same reaction. The leaves prove to be the chief factories

·of hydrocyanic acid in Pangium, though there are other much smaller local factories
of this substance in the tissues of other organs. The hydrocyanic acid formed in
the leaves is conducted through the leaf-stalks to the stem, and distributed to the
spots where plastic material is wanted. The acid travels in the phloem of the
tibro-vascular bundles. Dr. Treub regards the hydrocyanic acid in Pangium edule

as one of the first plastic materials for building up proteids ; he thinks it is, in this
plant, the first detectable, and perhaps the first formed product of the assimilation
·of inorganic nitrogen. In accordance with this hypothesis, the formation of hydro-
cyanic acid in Pangium depends, on the one hand, on the presence of carbo-hydrates
or analogous products of the carbon-assimilation, and, on the other hand, on the
presence of nitrates. These two points were proved, or at least rendered probable,
by a great number of experiments made by Dr. Treub in the Buitenzorg Gardens.
(The details of this investigation will be found in a paper published in the ' Annales
·de jardin botanique de Buitenzorg ').

                     6. Exhibition of Models illustrating KaryoMnesis.

                       By Professor J . Bretland Farmer.

    Professor Farmer described a set of wax models illustrating the typical forms

passed through, and the chief variations exhibited by, the chromosomes d^riug the
          --

made of a mixture of one part of white wax, with five parts of paratiin, the melt-
ing point of which is about 60° C.

             The Section did not meet.

                            MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 16.

   A joint discussion with Section B was held on the Relation of Agriculture to

Science. See p. 660.

    The following Papers were read :

        1. Oil the Destruction of a Cedar Tree at Kew by Lightning.
                       By W. T. "Thiselton-Dyer, F.R.S.

     The President of the Section exhibited photographs and specimens of a large
cedar Cedrus Deodara, Loud.) from Kew, which had been struck and completely

                    (

shattered by lightning on August 10. It was pointed out that the main stem had
been in part blown into matchwood by the violence of the shock, and branches
were torn off with large portions of the trunk adhering to their base. The explo-
sion seemed to have been centrifugal, the stem having been disrupted from the
centre, and not merely stripped superficially. .

          2. On the Formation of Bacterial Colonies.
            By Professor Marshall Ward, F.R.S.

The author has examined the details of development of the colony in numerous

species from a single spore by employing microscopic plate-cultures, which can be

kept under observation with a one-twelfth and even a one-twentieth oil-immer-

sion lens, or by making pure Klatschpraparate on cover-slips covered with a thin

film of gelatine.

    He finds many factors of importance affecting the form, extent, rapidity of

growth, and other characters of colonies                                                                                                                                                                                     the elasticity of the gelatine, the presence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

of moist films on the surface of the gelatine, the rate of (slight) liquefaction, &c.,

--all being of importance in explaining the shapes, &c., of submerged colonies ' whet-
--stone shaped,' moruloid, spherical, or lobed colonies the mode of emergence and

spreading over the surface of the gelatine, the formation of radiating fringes, irides-

cent plates, &c.

     Exposure to light during the development of liquefying colonies may pro-

foundly affect their shape and other properties, a phenomenon closely connected

with the retardation of liquefaction and growth. Pigment bacteria may give rise
to perfectly colourless races when cidtivated under certain conditions, and the colour

restored by again changing the conditions ; a fact which the author has not only
confirmed with red forms, but which he shows to be true of a violet bacillus.
Species commonly described as non-motile show active movements under certain

conditions, and the sizes of bacteria are not constant in different regions of one

and the same colony. Details have been worked out for series of types the ex-

tremes of which differ considerably in liquefying power, and essential difference

in the appearance of a colony may depend on the amount of liquefying power

e\inced.

Some curious cases of travelling films, the lobes and contorted tresses of which

move like amoebae over the surface of the gelatine, were also examined.
    The facts point to (1) differences in colonies even of one species may depend on

much more subtle differences                           in cultures  than are usually recognised                                                                                                          (2) varietal

                                               ;

bacteria with the aid of works of known authority are partly due to varieties of

the same species being recorded by different observers under different names, and

the author thinks some more consistent prearranged plan of working out the

characters of such forms should be developed by bacteriologists than at present

exists.

             3. On a Supposed Case of Symbiosis in Tetraplodon.
                            £y Professor F. E. Weiss.

The author exhibited specimens of Tetraplodon from the CachuUin Hills in

Skye, where it was found plentifully on animal excreta. In September he found

many of the patches mixed with an orange-coloured Peziza, which did not appear

to have in any way injured the moss plants. The rhizoids of the moss, however,

contained in many cases fungal hyphse closely resembling those of the Peziza, and

though present in the cells of the moss these latter did not seem to be injured by

them.    Pie suggested that this might be                           a    case  of  symbiosis                                        the moss, as in the
                                                                                                                                 ;

case of other green plants, making use of the fungal hyphse to obtain its nutriment

from the organic material. The ultimate proof of such a case of symbiosis would,

however, necessarily depend upon culture experiments, which he xmderstood were

now being made by another observer.

     The following Papers were read :

                    1. On Amber. By Dr. Conwentz, Danzig.

     The author of this paper gave an account of the Baltic and English amber, and

their vegetable contents. After describing the different forms of Tertiary amber,
be referred to the occurrence of succinite on the coasts of Essex, Suffolk, and Nor-
folk ; the specimens are usually found with seaweed, thrown up by the tides.
Occasionally pieces have been met with weighing over two pounds. Dr. Conwentz
described the method of examining the plant fragments enclosed in amber, and
compared the manner of preservation witli that of recent plant sections mounted in
Canada balsam. The amber was originally poured out from the roots, stems, and
branches of injured or broken trees, in the form of resin, which on evaporation be-
came thickened, and finally assumed the form of succinite or some similar sub-
stance. For the most part the fossil resin was derived from the stems and roots of
coniferous trees of the genus Pinus. In addition to the exceptionally well-preserved
tissues of coniferous trees, the Baltic amber has yielded remarkable specimens of

monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous flowers. Some of the most striking examples
were illustrated by means of the excellent coloured plates from Dr. Conwentz's
monograph on the Baltic amber.'

     Mr. A. 0. Seward, after referring to the various species described by Mantell,
Carruthers, Starkie Gardner, and others, from the Wealden strata of England,

briefly described a large number of plants from the British Museum collection.

During the last few years Mr. Eufford, of Hastings, has obtained an extremely
valuable and rich collection of plants from Ecclesbourne, Fairlight, and other

localities; and these have now become the property of the nation. The following
species are at present known from the Wealden of England ; some of these have
already been figured in the first volume of the catalogue of the Wealden flora, and

the remainder are dealt with in the forthcoming second volume: Algites valdeiixis,

    3. On the Diurnal Variation in the Amo2int oj" Diastase in Foliage
              Leaves. By Professor J. Reynolds Green, F.H.S.

     The diastase which is present in foliage leaves varies in amount during the day,
being greatest in the early morning, and least after sunset. The variation has
been ascertained to be chiefly, if not entirely, due to the action of the sunlight.
The author showed last year, at the Oxford meeting, that diastatic extracts exposed
to sunlight or electric light, without the interposition of any form of screen, had
their activity largely impaired, the damage amounting sometimes to 70 per cent.
Experiments made upon the living leaf of a scarlet-runner showed a similar
destructive action of the light, the amount of destruction only amounting, how-
ever, to about 10 to 20 per cent. The author attributes the difl'erence to the

screening action of the proteids in the cells of the leaf.

         4. On the Strucitire of Bacterial Cells. By Harold Wager.

     In this paper an account was given of the present state of our knowledge of the
cells of bacteria. Reference was made to the observations of Schottelius, Migula,
De Bary, Biitschli, and others. The author showed that it is possible to demon-
 strate in the majority of bacterial cells the presence of two substances, one of which
may be regarded as protoplasmic in nature, and a second which stains deeply
when acted upon by fuchsin and kindred stainina: substances, and which may be
regarded as nuclear. It was pointed out that this nuclear substance does not

 possess the structure of nuclei in the cells of higher plants.

       5. On the ProthaUus and Embryo of Dansea. By G. Brebner.

      Mr. Bretner gave an account of the prothallus and sexual organs of Dansea
simplicifolia, Rudge, as the result of investigations made on some material fiom

the Botanic Gardens in British Guiana. He pointed out that there is a close

similarity between DoncBa and the ether two genera of the Marattiacece, An-
giopteris and Marattia, of which the prothallus has been previously described.

An interesting fact was noted as regards the prothallus rhizoids, which possess a

distinctly septate structure, and so far resemble a moss protonema. Possibly

 'imilar septate rhizoids may be found in the other marattiaceous genera. The
development of the antheridia oi Danaa agrees in the main with that in Marattia

and Angiopteris : the material did not allow of any developmental study of the
archegonia. The concentric bundle of the primary embryonic stem shows an
endodermal layer. On the whole the author found in Dancea a complete agree-

         6. On Cross and Self Fertilisation, with sjjecial reference to
                       Pollen Prepotency. By J. C. Willis.

     The time has passed for regarding self-fertilisation as being always necessarily
harmful in itself, and it is now recognised as a regular feature in the life-history of
many plants. There exist many cases of plants in which both self and cross polli-
nation occur nearly, or quite, simultaneously, and it is very desirable to know what

happens in these cases. Darwin's experiments render it probable that prepotency
of foreign pollen is usual. The author's experiments have been devoted to a study

of the relative chemical attraction of ' own ' and ' foreign ' pollen by the same

stigma (chiefly in gelatine and agar cultures), and have given negative results. It
seems probable, putting together all the various known facts, that prepotency,
where it occurs, is due to actions set up after the pollen tubes have entered the
stig-ma, these actions tending to favour the growth of the ' foreign ' pollen-tubes,

and to check that of the ' own ' pollen.
