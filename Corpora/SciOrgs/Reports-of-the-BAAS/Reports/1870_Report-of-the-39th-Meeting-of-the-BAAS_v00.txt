Report of the Council of the British Association for the year 1868-69,
   presented to the General Committee at Exeter on Wednesday,
    August 18, 1869.

   The Reports of the General Treasurer and of the Kew Committee for the

past year have been received, and will be laid before the General Committee.
   At the Meeting of the Association at Norwich, the General Committee

referred two Resolutions to the Council for consideration and action, if it
should be deemed desirable.

   The first Resolution was :
       That the Council be instructed to prepare and cause to be presented to

   the Houses of Lords aud Commons petitions on behalf of the Association,
   prajdng them without loss of time to pass such measures as wiU remedy

    the existing defects in Secondary Education in Schools, aud that the

   Council be empowered to take such other steps as in their j udgment may

    be best calculated to promote the object of these petitions.

   The Council, after receiving the report of a Committee specially appointed
by them to consider the question, resolved to act in accordance with this
Resolution. They consequently prepared the following Petition, which was
presented by the Right Hon. Lord Lyttelton to the House of Lords, by Sir

W. Tite to the House of Commons.

     The Humble Petition of the British Association for the Advancement

                                                            of Science

  --Sheweth, That one of the ends for which the Association was established

was to " obtain a more general attention to the objects of Science, and a re-
moval of any disadvantages of a pubhc kind which impede its progress."

    That some of the chief impediments to the progress of Science in the
United Kingdom are to be found in the limited aud defective state of Se-

condary Education, and in the condition of the Endowed Grammar Schools,

which, having been founded in past times, represent for the most part the
knowledge and wants of the past, rather than of the present.

   That, not-withstanding the defects of the Endowed Grammar Schools, they

are enabled, by their number, antiquity, and endowments, to maintain a
prescriptive rank and influence, and seriously to impede the adoption of im-
proved systems of education.

   That the necessity for inquiry into the state of the Endowed Grammar

Schools, and into the education given in schools generally, above the Ele-
mentary, has already been recognized in the appointment by Her Majesty of
three Commissions to report on this Class of Schools in England and

Scotland.

   That in the year 1866 the Council of the Association appointed a Com-
Mttee to consider the best means of promoting Scientific Education in Schools,
.and that thi§ Committee drew up a Report on the subject, which is printed
          ----

                       REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                 xliii

in the " Report of the Schools-Inquiry Commission," presented to Her Ma-

jesty, and laid before your Honoiirable House.

That the recommendations of the Schools-Inquiry Commission, in regard

to the introduction of the study of Natural Science into all Secondary Schools,

are in general accordance with the views of the Association.

That, in the opinion of the Association, the study of Natural Science,

whether as a means of disciplining the mind, or for providing knowledge

useful for the purposes of life, is of essential importance to the youth of this

country; and that it ought to form a part of education in all Secondary

Schools.

That the Association consider the Secondary Education of the United

Kingdom, both in regard to the quality and the range of the subjects of

study, to be incommensurate with the needs of a well-organized state ; they

therefore request your Honourable House to enact such laws as shall make

Natural Science an essential part of the course of education, and to put it on
a footing of equality with the most favoured subjects of study.

   The Second Ilesolutiou referred to the Council by the General Committee
at Norwich was :

   That the Council of the British Association be requested to urge upon
Government and through the British Government upon the Governments of

Foreign Nations, the importance of fixing, by permanent bench-marks, cer-
tain points of level, and also of position in reference to secular changes (1st)
in the elevation of the land as referred to the sea-level, and (2nd) in relation
to changes of coast-line, and to the position of ice-masses.

That the CouncU of this Association be requested to ask the support and

cooperation in this of the Council of the Iloyal Society ; and that the fol-

lowing be a Committee to assist the Council and that of the Eoyal Society

--in the definition of the works proposted to be executed : W. Sartorius von
HemyWaltershausen, Lieut. -Colonel Sir
                                        James, E.E., F.E.S., Ilobert A. C.

Godwin-Austen, F.E.S.

   The Council appointed a Committee, consisting of Sir Henry James, Sir
C. Whcatstone, Mr. Godwin-Austen, Professor Tyudall, Professor Ilamsay,
the President, General Secretaries, and Treasurer, to consider this resolution
and to report thereon.

   This Eeport being favourable, your Council applied to the Council of the

Eoyal Society, who at once promised their support in any application to
Government, but deemed it unnecessary to augment the Committee already

elected by your Council for the purpose of defining the works proposed to
be executed. This Committee has not yet concluded its labours.

   The following foreign men of Science, who were present at the Norwich
Meetiag, have been elected Corresponding Members :

Baron von Miidler, Dorpat.            Professor L. Eadlkofer, Munich.
Padre Secchi, Director of the Obser-  Professor Karl Koch.

   The Council are able to report that the Annual Yolume was this year
again issiicd in June ; a stiU earlier publication being desirable, however, it
is proposed to publish the next volume at Christmas : but in order to do so
it win be necessary to defer until the foUowirg year the publication of

reports which arc not ready for the press immediately after the close of this
present Meeting of the Association.

   The Coimcil have been informed that Invitations for 1870 will be pre-
sented to the General Committee by Deputations from Liverpool, Edinbiu'gh,
Brighton, and Bradford.

  Report of the Keiv Committee of the British Association for the Ad-

                              vancement of Science for 1868-69.

  The Committee of the Kcw Observatory submit to the Council of the British

Association the following statement of their proceedings during the past
year :

   The nature and amount of assistance to be rendered by this Committee to
the Meteorological Committee of the lloyal Society have now been clearly de-

fined, and the duties undertaken at Kew Observatory may, as in the last

Beport, for clearness" sake be again considered under the two following
heads :

       (A) The work done under the direction of the British Association.

      (B) That done at Kew as the Central Observatory of the Meteorological

                    Committee,

   This system of division will be adopted in this Eeport, and it has been
thought desirable, for the information of the Association, in the financial
statement hereto appended, to include the sums received from the Meteoro-
logical Committee as well as those received from the British Association. It

will thus be clearly seen that the woi'k done at Kew for the Meteorological

Committee has been paid for from funds suj^plied by that Committee, and not

in any way from money subscribed by the British Association.

  --1. Mac/netic ivorl: The Self-recording Magnetographs ordered by the

Mauritius Government for Mr. Meldrum, after having been verified at Kew,

have been forwarded to their destination.

  A Unifilar and Dip-circle for Mr. Meldrum have likewise been verified.
  A Unifilar and Dip-circle have been repaired and verified for the Rev. M.

Colombel, who has gone to Nankin, where he intends making magnctical

observations.

   M. Colombel as well as M. Berg, of the Wilna Observatory, have received
magnetical instruction at Kew.

  A Dip-circle is in the course of being verified for Lieut. Elagin, of the

Bussian Navy.
   The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-

tinue to be made by Mr. "Whipple, Magnetic Assistant. During the last year
it has been found necessary to replace the wooden pillars of the magnetic
house with pillars of Portland stone, which had been previously ascertained
to be non-magnetic. It has also been found necessary slightly to repair the
Unifilar and Dip-circle hitherto used in these monthly determinations.

   The Self-recording Magnetographs are in constant operation as heretofore,
also under the charge of Mr. Whipple, and the photographic department
connected with these instruments remains under the charge of Mr. Page.

  The task of tabulating and reducing the magnetic curves produced at Kew
         --

         REPORT Ot TflE KEW COMMITTEE.                 xlv

subsequent to January 1865 is in progress under the direction of Mr.
Stewart. Considerable advance has been made in these reductions during
the present year, and it is hoped that during the next session of the lioyal

Society a paper may be commviuicated to that body b}- Mr. Stewart, giving

certain results of these reductions, as well as results of the absolute magnetic

observations made eveiy month.

    Lieut. Elagin has communicated through Mr. Stewart to the Eoyal Society
an account of observations made at the various European observatories, bj'

means of a Dip-circle which had been lent to him from the Kew Observatory.

    Mr. Stewart has likewise communicated to the Eoyal Society a short paper

by Senhor Capello " On the reappearance of certain periods of Declination-

disturbance during two, three, or several days;" also a joint paper by the

Eev. W. Sidgreaves and himself, embodying the results of a preliminary
comparison of the Kew and Stonyhurst declination-curves ; also a paper em-

bodying the magnetical results obtained by Lieut. Kokeb}' at the island of
Ascension, reduced by Mr. Whipple, Magnetical Assistant at Kew. Finally,
Mr. Stewart has communicated to the Eoyal Society a paper containing a

preliminaiy discussion of the peaks and hollows of the Kew magnetic curves

--for the first two years during which the Magnetographs were in operation.
    2. Meteorolor/ical ivorh. The meteorological work of the Observatory
continues in the charge of Mr. Baker.

    Since the ISTorwich Meeting, 157 Barometers have been verified, and 27
have been rejected; 1153 thermometers have been verified, and 24 have

been rejected. Two Standard Thermometers have been constructed for the

Standards' Commission*, one for Stonyhiirst College, and nine for Professor
Tait. 38 Hydrometers have likewise been verified.

   The progressive nature of this department of the Kew work will be seen

by the following statement of the numbers of Barometers and Thermometers
verified during the last few years :

  The self-recording meteorological instruments now at work at Kew will

be again mentioned in the second division of this Eeport. These are in the
charge of Mr. Baker, the photography being superintended by Mr. Page.

  A Self-recording Barograph verified at Kew for Messrs. E. & J. Beck has

been disposed of by these opticians to Mr. Meldrum, of the Mauritius Obser-

vatory. A Barograph and Thermograph have been verified at Kew and dis-

patched to Mr. Ellery, at Melbourne, and a Barograph has recently been veri-
fied for Mr. Smallcy, of Sydney.

   At the request of Mr. O. J. Symons, the old Kew Thermometer frame has

been lent to him for certain experiments, which are being carried on by him

in conjunction M'ith the Ecv. C. IT. Griffith, at Strathficld Turgis.

   The attention of meteorologists is directed towards an instrument devised
by Mr. Beckley, mechanical assistant at Kew, for the piu-pose of registering

to the Association at Exeter.

   Attention is likewise directed to a paper to be communicated by Mr.
Balfour Stewart to the Association at the Exeter Meeting, entitled " Eemarks
on Meteorological Eeductions, with especial reference to the Element of Va-
pour ; " separate copies of which will be at the disposal of Members.

   The following revised fees are charged for tho verification of meteorological

instruments at Kew :

 --3. Photoheliograph. The Kew Heliograph, in charge of Mr. De La Rue,

continues to be worked in a satisfactory manner. During the past year 274

negatives have been taken on 168 days : 40 pictures of the Pagoda in Kew

Gardens, as a fixed terrestrial object at a known distance, have likewise

been taken, with the object of determining, by measurements of these

pictures, M'hich are taken in difi'erent parts of the field of the telescope,

both the optical distortion of the sun -pictures and the angular diameter of

the Sun.

  A paper communicated to the Eoyal Society by Messrs. Warren De La Rue,

--Stewart, and Loewy, entitled " Researches on Solar Physics. Heliographieal

Positions and Areas of Sun-spots observed with the Kew Photoheliograph

during the years 1862 and 1863," is the first of the series of reductions of

the photographic solar records ; it is in the course of publication in the

' Transactions ' and will shortly be distributed.

    It is hoped that, during next winter, a paper containing the heliographieal

positions and areas of the spots observed at Kew during the years 1864,
1865, and 1866 may be communicated to the Royal Society, as well as a

paper representing, both numerically and graphically, the spotted area of the

sun during three complete solar periods, the results being partly derived

from Schwabe's and partly from Carrington's observations, in addition to those

made with the Kew photoheliograijh.

    Another paper by the above authors, entitled "Account of some Recent

Observations on Sun-spots made at the Kew Observatory," has Hkewise been

ordered to be published in the ' Philosophical Transactions.'

    M. Berg, of the Wilna Observatory, has during the past year received

instruction at Kew in the method of taking Solar Photographs and in that of

measuring the positions and areas of sun-spots, the Du-ector of the Obser-
vatory with which he is connected being dcsiro\is of working along with
Kew, and of following out the same methods of observation as well as the

same researches.
    The number of sun-spots recorded after the manner of Hofrath Schwabe,

together with a Table exhibiting the monthly groups observed at Dessau and

at Kew for the year 1868, have been communicated to the Astronomical

 Society, and published in their ' Monthly Notices.'

   We regret to mention that Hofrath Schwabe, owing to his great age, has

 found it necessary to discontinue his observations ; but the Committee have
 satisfaction in stating that arrangements have been made for continuing, at
 Kew, the grouping of sun-observations which has been carried on for some
                                                                    ;

time according to Hofrath Scliwabe's plan, and for publishing the results

annually.

  A minute comparison of the records of Hofrath Schwabe with the simul-

taneous photographic records at Kew has revealed the great trustworthiness
of his drawings, which are at present in the possession of Kew Observatory.

The proposed communication ah-eady alluded to as representing the spotted
area of the sun during three complete solar periods is thus rendered possible
and whUe it is imagined that by this means a valuable record of the past will

be obtained, it is hoped that the interest now displayed in solar research will

--secure the uninterrupted continuance of such a record for the future.
   4. Miscellaneous work. The Superintendent has recently received a grant
of £60 from the Government-Grant Committee of the Eoyal Society for the
purpose of continuing certain experiments by Prof. Tait and himself on the
rotation of a disk {)i vacuo ; and means are iu progress for obtaining a nearly
perfect vacuum, Mr. Beckley, Mechanical Assistant at Kew, having devised
an apparatus for this purpose.

   An account of preliminary observations made with Eater's pendulum by

the Superintendent, in conjimction with Mr. B. Loewy, has been communi-
cated to the Eoyal Society.

    The instrument devised by Mr. Broun for the purpose of estimating the
magnetic dip by means of soft iron, constructed at the expense of the British
Association, remains at present at the Observatory awaiting Mr. Broun's
return to England.

   The Observatory was honoured on June 25th by a visit from the eminent
French chemist, M. Dumas, permanent Secretary of the Imperial Academy
of Sciences, Paris, accompanied by M. Herve-Mangon.

      (B) Work done at Kew as the Central Observatory op the

                                 Meteorological Committee.

 The  relation  between  the  two  Committees,  the Kew and the Meteorolo-

_

gical, has during the last year been definitely settled.

The Kew Committee have undertaken to maintain the self-recording in-

struments belonging to the Meteorological Committee in regular operation at

Kew, to tabulate from the traces, and to forward the traces and tabulations

once a month to the central office of the Meteorological Committee in London,

where they will be finally reduced, under the supervision of the Director of

that office. They have also sanctioned the employment of such assistance

by Mr, Stewart as may be necessary to enable him to examine the records

which arrive from the various outlying observatories of the Meteorological

Committee iu accordance with a plan which has been approved by that body.

Once a week, therefore, documents from these various observatories arrive at

Kew, and about the middle of each month the documents for all the obser-

vatories (including Kew) for the previous month, after having been well

examined, are forwarded to the Meteorological Office with a few remarks,

which are printed in the Minutes of tlie Meteorological Committee.

Besides these duties which they have undertaken, the Kew Committee are

glad to render the Meteorological Committee any occasional assistance which

it may be in their power to bestow.

 --1. Work done at Kew as one of the Observatories of the Meteorological Com-

mittee. This consists in keeping in constant operation the Barograph, Ther-

mograph, and Anemograph furnished by the Meteorological Committee. Mr,

Baker is in charge of these instruments. From the fii'st two of these instru-
               --

xlviii             --REPORT 18G9.

mcnts traces ia duplicate are obtained, one set being sent to the Meteoro-

logical Office and one retained at Kew ; as regards the Anemograph, the

original records are sent, while a copy by hand of these on tracing-paper is

retained. The tabulations from the curves of the Kew instruments are made

by Messrs. Baker, Page, and Foster,

 --2. Verification of liecords. In order to maintain uniformity in the system

of observation at the \-arious meteorological observatories, it is arranged by

the Meteorological Committee that Mr. Stewart shall personally visit all the

observatories once every year, in addition to which, when necessary, some

Kewone of the  assistants will occasionally visit particular stations with a

specific object in view. At the request of the Meteorological Committee,

a system of checks has been devised by the Kew Committee for testing the

accuracy of the observations made at the different Observatories. This system,

with slight modifications, is now in operation*. As this revision takes place

at Kew, it has been found necessary to engage an additional assistant for the

--purjjose of undertaking it. Mr. Rigby has been engaged for this duty Mr.

Baker, Meteorological Assistant, having the general superintendence of this

--dei)artment.
    3. Occasional Assistance. In addition to devising the system of checks

mentioned above, the Kew Committee have also, at the request of the

Meteorological Committee, examined the subject of instrumental verifica-

tions, and it has been found that, owing to improved construction, a higher

standard of excellence in meteorological instruments may be insisted upon

without rejecting more than a very small percentage of those furnished by

good makers.

It has therefore been resolved by the Meteorological Committee that in

future the following limits of error shall be allowed in the construction of

their instruments :

  --Marine Barometers of the pattern adopted hy the Meteorological Office.

Reject all for which the index-error at the ordinary pressure is greater

than '015 inch, or the capacity-error greater than -OO-i inch, or for which

the mercury does not fall from 1| inch to | inch above the present pressure
in a time between 3 and 6 minutes. But for barometers imrportinc/ to he

standards, reject all for which the index-error at the ordinary pressure is
greater than -010 inch.

  --Thermometers {graduated on the stem) of the pattern adopted by the Meteo-

rological Office. Reject all in which the largest error at any point is greater
than 0°-3, or in which any space of 10° is more than 0°"3 wrong.

 --Hydrometers of the pattern adopted by the Meteorological Office. Reject all

in which the largest error at any point is greater than 1 division of the scale

(equal to -001 sp. gr.), or in which any space of 10 divisions is more than
0-6 division wrong.

   Models of Pantagraphic Apparatus, designed by Mr. Galton, have been
made and experimentally used at Kew, at the desire of the Meteorological
Committee, to reduce the tracings of the self-registering instruments in any

desired proportions, either in length or in breadtli, with a view to the ulti-
mate publication by that Committee of all the tracings supplied by the seven
Observatories in a compact volume.

   It may also be mentioned, under tlie head of Occasional Assistance, that

at the reqiiest of the Meteorological Committee, Mr. Beckley, Mechanical

wick-mause, Orkney, to superintend the erection of an anemometer. The

expenses have, on both these occasions, been repaid by the Meteorological

Committee.

   In conclusion, the Kew Committee desire to bring under the notice of the

British Association, that the system of automatic records established and in

actual n'ork at the Kew Observatory, comprehends magnetic, barometric, and

thermometric observations, as well as those of the direction and velocity of
the wind, to which an electric self-recording instmment will soon be added.
They think that it would be very advantageous to magnetical and meteo-
rological science if a fully illustrated work were published descriptive of these
instruments, and of the method of working them, together with the method

of reductions actually employed.

15th July, 1869.

                  APPENDIX.

A Description of the Means adopted by the Meteorological Com-

      mittee for ensixriug Accuracy in the Numerical Values

       obtained from their Self-recording Instruments.

(Extracted, with permission, from the Eeport of the Meteorological Committee.)

In the first Eeport of this Committee the principles of construction of their
self-recording instraments were fully described, and enough was said to ren-
der it probable that good results would be obtained ; but the final method
of tabulating from the traces of these instruments was not then decided on,
nor had any scheme been devised for ensuring accuracy in the tabulated

numerical values.

   The labours of the Committee in this department have been materially
aided by suggestions from the superintending Committee of the Central (Kew)
Observatory, and also from the Directors of the various outlying observatories,
and as a result the Committee are now satisfied that the process of examina-
tion to which the tabulated values are subjected before reaching the central

office is such as to afford a satisfactory guarantee of accuracy.

   It may be a fitting sequel to the description of these instruments (already

given), to give here an account of the method adopted for ensuring accuracy

in the results which they afford.
    In the first place, the nature of the various instrumental errors and the

best method of avoiding these may with propriety be described, and in the
next place it may be desirable to give in detaU the code of regulations

adopted by the Committee for the guidance of their various observatories.

                                  BAEOGRAPn.

   The values of atmospheric pressure derived from this instrument are
liable to have their accuracy affected by tliree causes :

(1) By an imperfect temperature compensation.                                   are

(2) By a sluggish action of the mercury in the Barograph tube.

(3) By imperfection in the system of recording and tabulating.

--Temperatuye compensation. The method by which the Barographs

compensated for temperature has been described in the Report of the

Meteorological Committee for the year 1867. The precise position of the

fulcrum of the glass rod was determined by means of some preliminary expe-
       REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                                 H

riments made at Kew upon the first Barograph. These experiments consisted

in subjecting the instrument to a very considerable range of temperature
artificially produced, while frequent comparisons of its indications with those
of a Standard Barometer gave the means of determining approximately

what ought to be the position of the fulcrum. It may be presumed that the

determination thus arrived at cannot be wrong more than one-tenth of the
whole, and assuming this to be the case, the next point is to find what is the

actual daily temperature range at the various observatories.

   The following Table exhibits both the mean and the maximum daily range

for each mouth for each of the seven observatories up to the end of 1868. In
all these, with the exception of tStonyhurst, a night observation is made of
the temperature of the Barograph at 10 o'clock, but the result will show that
in Stouyhurst such an observation is unnecessary. It ought here to be borne
in mind that from the system adopted in these instruments, namely, constant
reference each day to a standard, it is only the daily range of temperature
that we have to consider.

                                            observation hours.

repose, and the adliesion of the inercuiy to the glass is not counteracted by

tapping or moving the tube, it is desirable to test the results obtained in order

to see if the influence of adhesion causes a perceptible sluggishness of the

mercury. The Standard Barometers, to which in aU cases the Barographs

are referred, are, on the other hand, subject to motion, and are probably

sufficiently moved in the operation of reading to counteract any sluggishness

of the mercury.

Now, four or five times each day, while the light is cut off from the re-

cording cylinder of the Barograph by the clock an-augment, the Standard

WeBarometer is read.  can thus compare these standard readings with the

simultaneous measurements of the Barograms, these latter being of course

properly tabulated, converted into true inches, and the residual correction

applied as described in the Eeport of the Meteorological Committee for 1867.

   Should there be any sluggishness in the mercury of the Barograph we

might expect to discover it by means of this comparison, for in such a case

the Barograph would lag behind, and thus read too low with a rising and too

high with a falling barometer.

If therefore we presume that the Standard Barometer is free from slug-

gishness, and denote its readings by S, and those of the Barograph by B,

--theu S B ought in the case of sluggishness of the Barograph to be positive

for a risincf and negative for a falling barometer.

Several months' observations have been discussed in this manner for each

of the observatories, and the result is exhibited in the following Table :

 besides giving a bad result, it might come into contact with the end of the

of a low barometer ; and finally, great precaution should be taken to avoid

                     (B) Errors of Time and Date.

Suppose that the sheet has been placed in an unexceptionable manner

upon the Barograph cylinder, the next point is for the operator to set the

instrumental clock before starting to correct Greenwich mean time, as given by

his chronometer. Now the instrumental clock has an arrangement for cutting

oif the light for four minutes every two hours, beginning to do so two minutes

before an even hour and ending two minutes after it, and the practice is for

the observer to read the Standard Barometer about five times every day at

periods two minutes after even hours, as ascertained by his chronometer, or

when the light should be about to be restored after having been cut off by the

clock-stop. If therefore the instrumental clock keeps good time and its stop

acts, and if the observer reads the Standard Barometer correctly and at the

proper moment as ascertained by his chronometer, and if he finally reduces

his curves properly, the near coincidence between the corresponding curve

and Standard readings will be a good practical test, not only that all these

operations have been properly performed, but also that throughout the curve

Athe instrumental clock keeps good time with the chronometer.            further

check with regard to time is afforded by the comparison made between the

chronometer and the instrumental clock at the moment when the curve is

taken off the cylinder, the results of which are recorded on the curve.

The clock may sometimes possibly stop, or the clock-stop may go wrong.

Without discussing minutely these possibilities, it may be sufficient to state

that when any such misadventure occurs the curve ought to be inspected by

the Director of the Central Observatory.

There still remains the question of date. The security that a curve is

rightly dated depends ultimately on the strong improbability that an obser-

ver at any of the observatories should make a mistake with regard to the

first day of the week. When therefore he returns the Barograph journal

filled up, we may be quite certain that the observations entered on the line

with Sunday were really made on that day, although he may possibly put

the wrong day of the month on the form beside it.

Again, the photographic operator when he takes off a curve, should mark

on the back in pencil the day of the week and month when the curve was

taken off, and should also, after drj^ing, write upon its face the hour and day

of piittiug on and taking off as recorded by the joiirnal. If, therefore, the

accuracy of the observer in assigning the proper day of the month to Sunday

be checked at Kew as each week's journals are transmitted to that establish-

ment, and if it also be seen that the date written in pencil on the back of the

curve corresponds to that written on its face, and if the times of starting and

ending of the curve as described in front are found to agree with the curve

itself as measured by a simple time-scale, there can hardly be any doubt that

the curve has been properly dated ; if there still remain any doubt it wiU be

dispelled when the tabulations from that curve are examined and it is found

that the tabulated readings agree well with the simultaneous readings of the

Standard Barometer.

                            (C) Errors in tabulating from the traces.

     It will, in the first place, be necessary to discuss some arrangement for en-
 suring the entry under the projyer date into the tabulation forms of the mea-

surements from each curve ; for even supposing that by the method now de-
scribed we can ensure the proper dating of the curve, yet the tabulations from
this curve may be entered under the wrong date in the tabulation form.

    The appropriate cheek would seem to be the independent entry from the
journal of the Standard readings reduced. For if either of these two inde-
pendent entries be wrongly made, this will be seen by a non-coincidence
of the reduced readings when compared with the simultaneous Standard
readings. Oiu' security becomes, therefore, the security which we have that
these two independent readings cannot both be erroneously entered, and this

may be converted into a certainty if the assistant at the Central Observatory

sees that the journal readings are entered under their proper dates into the
Barograph tabulation forms.

    Having thus ascertained the entry into the tabulation forms imder their

proper dates of the tabulations and of the reduced standard readings, we come
next to inquire what check there is for accuracy of tabulations ; and here we
may consider separately the cases of large and small errors.

    But before proceeding to this part of the subject it may be desirable to say

a few words regarding the system of Barograph tabulation
    The progress made in tabulating the Barograms up to the date of publica-

tion of the last Report of the Committee has been described in that Eeport.
The first operation is to measui-e by the aid of a simple tabulating instru-
ment, carrying a scale with a vernier attached to it, and capable of being
read to the thousandth of an inch, the whole depth of the Barogram for every

hoiu'.

    This system is nevertheless laborioiis, implying two measurements and one
subtraction for each hour, besides the application of tables of conversion,
and the consequence is the liability to make an occasional mistake. But
although at first it is absolutely necessary to have in the ease of the
Barograph a tabulating instrument measuring inches, in order by its means

to determine the constants of each instrument, yet when once these instru-

mental constants have been accurately determined, it has been foimd ser-
\dceable to replace the tabulating instrument by another which gives the true
pressure in one measurement, instead of requiring two measurements, one
subtraction and one conversion. Instruments of this nature have been ob-
tained by this Committee for their various observatories, by which the labour

of tabulation has been greatly reduced and acciu'aoy of result much in-

creased.

   Nevertheless there is still the liability to make an occasional blunder, and
as this may take the shape of a large error, it is necessary to devise some
means for detecting and obviating all such mistakes.

   The best remedy appears to be the use of a simple kind of subsidiary tabu-
lating instrument, consisting of an ivory scale having a breadth equal to one
hour of the time-scale, by means of Avhich the hoarly depth of the Barogram

may be read to the hundredth of an inch. If these readings be compared

with the readings taken independently by the tabulating instrument, any
error in the latter will be at once discovered ; for the errors to which the

--tabulated measurements are liable are such as five hunclrcclths of an inch, or

one-tenth of an inch, errors of a large size, which may easily be detected by

the system of sudsidiary measurement.
               --

               KEPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.  Iv

   The following is an example of a day's comparison after this method, ex-
hibiting an error which has thus been brought to light :

August 2Dtli,
Ivi REPORT 1869.

Standard readings have been reduced to 32° ought in this case to be ex-

amined. When a Standard reading is evidently wrong it ought to be noted

as such on the curve, and should not be made use of either in calculating the
residual correction or the monthly mean difFerence between the Standard
and Barograph readings. By applying both the above tests any error in the
calculation of the residual correction will be detected, and ought to be remedied
at once. Having by this means obtained an accurately calculated residual

correction, the accuracy with which this is applied to the various hours oiight

to be tested by the Kew assistant, who, obscuring fi'om his view the coliamn

which embodies the values after the residual correction has been applied,

should independently apply it on a separate piece of paper, thus producing

a new column of corrected pressure, which ought to be compared with the old

one ; any error discovered by this comparison should be corrected at once.
Before leaving this subject, it ought to be stated that the tabulating instru-
ment as well as the subsidiary ivory scale are so arranged as always to ensure
reading the proper point of the curve for every odd hour.

    Should anjr portion of the curve be too faint for measurement with the
ordinary tabulating instrument, but not too faint for measurement with the
ivory scale, it ought to be measured with this scale, applying to the mea-

surements so obtained their own appropi-iate residual correction. Such read-

ings ought to be specially noted in the tabulation forms.
    Should any part of tlie curve be deficient from ivant of light or any other

cause, it ought not to be inked in. If the deficiency be in the border of the
temperature curve, it will be possible to correct it, but if it be in the baro-
metric curve, this cannot be done.

   All curves in which the clock has stopped or the cJoclc-stop has been out of
action, should be personally inspected by the Director of the Central Obser-

vatory, in order that he may ascertain if the tabulations have been properly

made.

    Finally, it is right to state that the accitracy of the method of checking
the tabulated values now described, has been practically confirmed by the
month of October at Ivew being independently measured by two observers.
The results of the two sets, when compared together, are found to differ very

slightly from one another, the greatest difference being -008 in., which may

be supposed to denote a difference in each of -004 on either side of the truth.
This extreme difference only occurs three times in the course of the month,
that is to say, in 744 observations.

   The method of subsidiary tabulations now described is thus proved to be
effective in discovering the larger errors that the observer is liable to make
when he measures the curve. But to ensure an efficient standard of correct-

ness, it is not only necessary that the larger errors should be altogether

eliminated, but smaller ei-rors should be reduced to a minimum. Thus an
observer might be sufficiently cautious in reading his scale to make no large
error, yet sufficiently incautious to read erroneously when he came to the
third figure of decimals. For rough results such an observer might bo
reckoned a good one, but for the more delicate class of investigations his
figures would be of less value.

   The only way of perfectly eliminating this class of errors is for two inde-
pendent observers to make separate measurements, each with a tabulating
instrument, a course involving much additional labour and expense. But it

is obvious that the Standard Barometer affords a ready approximate means
of estimating the coircctuess of an observer's results. For should he be an
incautious observer, the mean difference between the simultaneous readings

   The accuracy of the Thermograph results is liable to be deranged by three

causes :

   (1) By a cause depending on the situation and exposure of the instru-

                ment.

   (2) By instrumental deficiencies, and especially the arrangements con-

              nected with the wet bulb.

   (3) By a deficient system of tabulation.

                                             Sihuition of Instruments.

    The situation of their various Thermographs was a point carefully con-
sidered by the Meteorological Committee, and there is no reason to think
that the effect of local peculiarity is considerable in the case of any of their

instruments.

    In the Report for 1867 this subject was alluded to, and the restdt of

simultaneous comparisons made at Kew between the readings of two sets of

dry and wet bulbs was given for the month of Februaiy, one of these sets
being placed in a frame detached from the main building of the observatory,

and the thermometers having very small bulbs, the other set being the wet-
and dry-bulb Standard Thermometers of the Thermograph frame.

    The result seemed to indicate that the local peculiarity of either frame
was comparatively small ; indeed, taking the average of the month, there
was no residual difference between the dry bulbs, while, on the whole, the
Thermograph wet bulb stood 0°*12 higher than the other.

  A similar comparison made for the month of July gave no residual differ-

ence either for the dry or wet bulbs.
   Dr. Robinson, of Armagh, has hkewise made a similar comparison between

his Thermograph dry bulb and another Thermometer placed at a higher
elevation, and has obtained as the result of 150 observations made during
the months of April and May, a mean difference indicating that the Thermo-
graph Thermometer read on the whole 0°-27 less than the other, "While
this difference is not large. Dr. Robinson is of opinion that the upper ther-
mometer is more liable to be affected by the sun, and that the Thermograph

Thermometer is in consequence the most correct. No other observations
have been made on the subject,

                                           Instrumen tal JDe/iciencies.

   The u'ct-hulb arrangements are peculiarly liable to go wrong, and the fol-
lowing course of action is suggested in order to reduce this source of error to
a minimum.

   The Standard Thermometers should be read at least five times a day at
those moments when the light is cvit off by the clock arrangement. The
light remains cut off by this arrangement for four minutes, and it is neces-
sarj^ to read the Standard Thermometers at the le(jinnimi of this interval;
the exact points in the curves corresponding to certain known readings of
the Standards may thvis be determined. "When the Standards are read, the
observer ought to notice if both wet bulbs are acting properly. If both are
right, the sign y' should be made after the recorded temperature of the wet
Standard. If the Thermograph wet bulb is wrong, the sign t should be
made, and if the Standard wet bulb is wrong, the sign s. Either wet bulb,
if found wrong, ought to be put right at once. Should it happen that the
wet bulbs are frozen at the moment of obsciTatiou, the present temperature

being also below 32°, cold water should be poured over the wet bulbs and
the connecting strings. In a few minutes the wet bulbs will by this means

be covered with a fresh coating of ice ; this should be repeated if necessary.
If this operation is performed two or three times a day during very cold

weather, there is reason to believe that the Avet bulb will always be covered

with a sufiScient coating of ice. But if the wet bulb and the water of the

water-vessel be frozen from previous cold, the present temperature being

above 32°, the ice of the water- vessel may be thawed by warm water, using

no more than is necessary for the purpose.

    If these regulations be followed during the cold months of the year, it is

believed that there are comparatively few instances where we may not know

the temperature of evaporation during frost.

    During diy weather the wet-bulb arrangement is again liable to go wrong,
although from a different cause. Tlie thread, which in the arrangement

adopted lies along a copper groove, gets dry in its passage from the water-

vessel to the bulb, the capUlary action ceasing. Sometimes it apparently

rights itself without aid, but sometimes it continues wrong until it is put
right at the next observation hour. The commencement and termination of
Buch a wrong state of the wet bulb are generally so clearly indicated by the

curve itself, that there appears to be little or no uncertainty in ascertaining
what observations ought to be rejected. This action would best appear to be
prevented by the use of an india-rubber tube lying along the metallic groove,
and having one end dipping into the water of the water-vessel ; and through
this tube the thread ought to be carried in its passage from the water-vessel

to the thermometer. Evaporation is thus avoided, and the arrangement

will probably answer in winter. When the supply of water is too rapid, it

may be easily and safely altered by turning up the tube.
   Even when the action of the wet bulb is unexceptionable, water must fre-

quently be added to the water- vessel. It is usual for this water to have the
temperature of the air ; but in cases of a great difference between the two

bidbs, this will be much above the temperature of evaporation; the con-

sequence is found to be, that in such cases there is a rise in the wet-bulb

curve which, in extreme cases, may not completely right itself until a quarter

of an hour has elapsed. This can only be remedied by each observatory
doing all in its power to ensure that under such circumstances the water
supplied to the water-vessel shall represent as nearly as possible the tem-
perature of the wet bulb at that moment, and also that the supply of water
from the water-vessel · to the wet bulb shall be no greater than is necessary
to keep the bulb thoroughly damp without dripping.

   With regard to other deficiencies, it will only be necessary to remark here
such as are peculiar to the Thermograph, since all those common to this in-
strument and the Barograph have already been stated under the head of the

latter.

   In the first place, it should be noticed that there is sufficient light to illu-
minate the whole range of the curve in a proper manner. In order to ensure
this, and at the same time procure the best possible definition, the heights of
the thermometers may, as occasion requires, aud without detriment to the
instrument, be altered so as to bring the mean temperature of the time into
a central position with respect to the lens and light. This change ouoht,
however, to be made as seldom as possible (perhaps twice or thrice in a year),
and when made great care ought to be taken that there is no strain upon the
wet-bidb Thermometer through tightness of the thread, whether arising
from frost or any other cause.

--Ix REPORT 1869.

                                 Errors in Trace and TahvJation.

   The arrangement proposed for ensuring the entry under the proper da*e
into the tabulation forms of the measuremeuts of the Thermograph curv/s,
and of the Standard readings corrected, is almost precisely the same as f.iat

stated in the case of the Barograph.

    Having ascertained the entry into the tabulation forms under their propt"
dates of the tabulations, and of the Standard readings corrected, -we come in
the next place to consider the check upon accuracy of tabulation, and here,

as in the case of the Barograph, it will be necessary to consider separately
large and small errors.

    In the first place, with respect to large errors, in order to prevent entirely
their occurrence, it is necessary to resort to the system of subsidiary tabula-

tions. An instrument for this purpose has been devised at Kew. It is un-

necessary here to state its principle of construction ; suffice it to say, that

the results furnished by it arc used in the same manner as in the case of the

Barograph ivory scale already mentioned. By this means correct columns
of tabulated readings may be obtained. Again, Avith regard to the Standard

readings, all that appears to be necessary is to examine both the accuracy of
entry of the Standard reading coi-rectcd, and the accuracy of tabulation for
aU those cases in which the recorded Thermograph temperature is more than
half a degree diiferent from the corresponding Standard reading, and to make

any correction that may be found to be necessary. When a Standard read-

ing is evidently wrong, it ought to be noted as such on the curve, and should
not be made iise of in calculating the monthly mean difference between
Standard and Thermograph readings. Before leaving this subject, it ought
to be stated that the tabulating instrument as well as the subsidiary scale,
are both so arranged as to ensure reading the proper point of the curve for
every odd hour.

    It ought to be noted that, in tabulating from the Thermograph curves, the
tabulating instrument should be set from those observation hours where

there is little thermoraetric fluctuation.

   AU the dry-hidb readings ought to he compared with the corresponding ivet-

hulb ones, and should the latter ever appear higher than the former, the case
ought to be marked.

   The maximum and minimum temperatures furnished by the outlying ob-

servatories ought to be checked.

   All Ia)-ge errors may, it is hoped, be completely obviated by the means now

 described.

  --With regard to small errors, the plan adopted is the same as that for the

Barograph, viz. :

    (1) To record the monthly mean difference between the sinraltancous
                Standard and Thermograph readings.

    (2) To make forty remeasurements from each month's curves at Kew.

    The following Table exhibits the results of the method employed for test-
 ing the accuracy of the Thermograph tabulations as regards small errors :

--Ixii REPORT 1869.

It is believed tliat tlie results of this Table afford satisfactory evidence not

only of the accuracy vrith which the Standard Thermometers are read,

Abut also of the accuracy of tabulation from the traces.                    tendency in the

monthly mean differences to decrease from their first values at starting wiU

be noticed in the case of all the observatories.

                                                Anemogeaph.

   The accuracy of the Anemograi^h is, like that of the Thermograph, liable
to be deranged by three causes :

   (1) By a cause depending on the situation and exposure of the instru-

                ment.

   (2) By instrumental deficiency, such as fi'iction.
   (3) By deficient traces and tabulations.

                     Situation of Instruments.

   These instruments are placed on the highest points of the various obser-
vatories, and as far as possible out of the reach of local influences. The

exposure may therefore be considered good in the case of all the obser-

vatories.

                     Instrumental Deficiencies,

   Priction is the most important of these, and may be supposed to affect to

a small extent both the records of direction and velocit)*. The axle of the
direction-vane moves in a wooden bearing, which is saturated with oU. It
is believed that when the instrument is regularly attended to, the friction
consequent upon this arrangement can be kept very small.

   As regards the influence of friction upon the velocity-records, this has

been determined in the case of the Kew instrument, and also by Dr. Robin-

son for his Anemograph, which has been for many years in operation. The

following friction coefficient has been adopted, with the concurrence of Dr.
Bobinson, as applicable to the records of all the Anemographs belonging to
tlie Meteorological Committee :

                     Errors of Trace and Tabulation.

It ought to be noticed that hotJi the direction- and the velociiy-pencils are

working well and freely on the j^aper.

It is also to bo noticed that, for all the observatories except Falmouth,

the needle on the cylinder goes through the centre of the crosses marked on

the metallic paper.

In Palmouth the velocity-pencil is slightly out in position, and in con-

seqiience that observatory has been directed to set to a point which is not

quite in the centre of the crosses. The Ealmouth instrument has also been

Aoriented for this position of setting.                   note of the proper position of setting

for Falmouth is preserved at Kew, and the assistant there ought to inspect

each Falmouth Anemogram to see that it has been properly set.
                   REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                            Ixiii'

   With, regard to date, each curve when taken off the cylinder should have
both the day of the week and of the month written upon it, and when it

reaches Kew it ought to be inspected by the assistant there in order to see

that the observer has attached the proper day of the month alongside the
day of the week.

   He should also see that the week's curves sent are dated consecutively.

   With regard to time, a prick made in the small time-scale of the metallic

sheet denotes in terms of the hour-lines ruled on this sheet, the moment of

starting, and a similar prick that of taking off. These pricks ought to denote
the true chronometer times of starting and taking off very nearly, if the in-
strumental clock has been properly regulated. All stoppac/es of the instru-
mental doclx: ought to be marked.

It ought also to bo noticed that the cylinder is well clamped, otherwise the

friction of the pencil upon the cylinder may occasionally overcome that of

the clamp, in which case the cylinder will slip.

KewWith regard to errors of tabulation, the assistant at     ought in the first

place to ascertain that the curve is tabulated under its proper date. Probably

an intelligent inspection of the direction- and velocity-records in connexion

with the tabulated results wiU be sufficient to determine this point.

  A simple system of subsidiary tahidations has been adopted in order to

check the dii-ection-results. The observer at the outlying observatory is

requested to write down on a separate sheet in numbers the direction of the
wind at each hour as read from the curve by his eye, and compare it, as in

the case of the Barograph and Thermograph, with the tabulated results. The
A --differences between the two columns or
                                                  B ought to be inspected at Kcav

and when they are greater than tivo points the ease ought to be examined'

and any error detected ought to be corrected at once. With respect to direc-

tion, fractional parts of a point ought not to be recorded.

 With  regard  to  velocity-traces,  the  action  of  the  instrument  is  sucli as  to

_

give by a glance at a curve the whole space travelled over by the wind for

that day. Perhaps, therefore, it will be a sufficient check upon the velocity-

records if, in addition to an intelligent comparison of the traces and tabula-

tions, each day's results are added up and the sum total compared with that

derived by glancing at the curve. When the difference between these two

daily sum totals is greater than one-twentieth of the whole, the tabulated velo-

cities for that day ought to be gone over again, and if any error is detected
it ought to be put right at once.

    It is probably unnecessaiy to check the recorded oscillations, as these are

of inferior scientific value, and additional labour bestowed upon them would
appear to be superfluous.

   Finally, in order to keep a check upon small errors, the system of making

at Kew forty remeasurements for each month, both for direction and velocity,

has been adopted.

   The following Table exhibits the results of the method employed for testing

the accuracy of the Anemograph tabulations as regards small errors.

   It will be seen from this Table that the standard of accuracy as repre-

sented by the smallness of the mean monthly differences has gradually in-
creased np to the end of the year.

Code of Regulations adopted by the Meteorological Committee
       for ensuring Accuracy iiin: the Results derived from their Self-
       RECORDING INSTRUMENTS

   la the first place a set of rules have been framed for the guidance of the
various observatories, inchiding the Central Observatory at Kew. Secondly,
a set of forms have been constructed on which to register the deficiencies and

mistakes in the returns from the various observatories, copies of which when

filled up are forwarded to the Directors of these observatories on the one
hand, and to the Meteorological Office on the other. Thirdly, a diary of

operations has been constructed, from which each observatory may know the
times at which the various documents ought to be sent to Kew. Fourthly,

each month's results are laid before the Meteorological Committee, accom-
panied with the remarks of the Director of the Central Observatory, which are
then printed in the minutes of that body*.

                                            Outlying Observatory.

(1.) The curves, journals, and tabulation forms to be written upon accord-

            ing to the pattern furnished.

(2.) Always begin a new month with new forms. The curves and forms

           are to be numbered consecutively from the beginning of the year,
           as will be seen from the diary.
(3.) Clock to be set to Greenwich mean time at starting, and its error
           not to exceed two minutes in two days.
(4.) The Barograph Thermometer and the Standard Barometer, and its
           attached Thermometer, ought to be read five times a day if pos-
          sible while the light is cut off by the clock- arrangement. The
           light remains cut off by this arrangement for four minutes, and it
           is necessary to read the Standard Barometer at the end of this

     --interval the exact points in the curve corresponding to certain

         known readings of the Standard may thus be determined. It ought
          to be noticed when the Standard is heaving or oscillating.

(5.) The instrument should always be started between 10 and 11 a.m.
          Greenwich mean time on those days mentioned in the diarJ^

(6.) Every change made in the instrument, every stoppage of clock, &c.,
           and all peculiarities in the curve, noticed by the observer, should
           be inserted in the journal under the head of " Remarks," with the

           exact time attached thereto. Should the height of the Barometer-

          cistern be altered, or any change made which will affect the curve,

            this ought, as already mentioned, to be noticed ; it is, however,

            considered that all such changes ought to be avoided.

(7.) The previous week's curves, journals, and tabulations should be sent

        to Kew every Thursday, as mentioned in the diary.

   * In these remarks there is recorded, amongst other things, each blank in the traces

during the montli. The following were the blanks for February 1809 :^

once. These corrections ought to be made before the next step in

the process is commenced.

been found according to the method described, and whenever it

has been found necessary to alter the residual correction, a cor-

(21.) Then check after the manner described the accuracy with which the
          residual correction has been applied, producing a new column of
           corrected pressure, which he shall compare with the old one, and
           any error discovered by this comparison shall be corrected at once.

printed in extenso in the Proceedings,

Resolutions referred to Council by the General Committee at Exeter.

   That the following Eesolntions be referred to the Conncil for consideration
and action if it seem desirable :

   (1) That the Conncil be reqnested to take into their consideration the ex-

isting relations between the Kew Committee and the British Association.

   That the full influence of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science should at once be exerted to obtain the appointment of a Eoyal Com-

mission to consider

       1. The character and value of existing institiitions and faciUties for
              scientific investigation, and the amount of time and money devoted

                to such purposes.

      2. What modifications or augmentations of the means and facilities that

               are at present available for the maintenance and extension of

                  science are requisite ; and,

       3. In what manner these can be best sujjplied.

    (2) That Professor E. B. Clifton, Mr. Glaisher, the Master of the Mint, Mr.

Huggins, Dr. Matthiessen, Professor W. Hallows Miller, Dr. Balfour Stewart,

Lieut. -Col. Strange, and Sir J. Whitworth, be a Committee for the purpose
of reporting on Metric Standards, in reference to the communication from
Professor Jacobi, appended hereto ; and that the Council be empowered to

petition the British Government in the name of the Association if they judge

it expedient to do so.

   " The Academy of Sciences of St. Petersbiirgh, observing that the Standard
Metric Weights and Measures of the various countries of Eurox)e and of the
United States diff'er by sensible, though small, quantities from one another,
express the opinion that the continuance of these errors would be highly
prejudicial to science. They believe that the injurious effects could not
be guarded against by private labours, however meritorious, and they have
therefore recommended that an International Commission be appointed by the
countries interested, to deal with this matter. They have decided to bring
the subject before the Eussian Government, and have appointed a Committee
of their own Body, who have drawn up a careful Eeport containing valuable
suggestions ; and they have deputed Professor Jacobi to lay this Eeport be-
fore the British Association, and to request the Association to take action in

reference to it."

   (3) That the Council be requested to ascertain whether the action of Go-
vernment in relation to the higher scientific education has been in accordance
with the principles of impartiality which were understood to guide them in
this matter ; and to consider whether that action has been well calculated to
utilize and develope the resources of the country for this end, and to favour
the free development of the higher scientific education. That the Council

be requested to take such measures as may appear to them best calculated to
carry out the conclusions to which they may be led by these inqiiiries and

deliberations.

   (4) That the rules under which Members are admitted to the General Com-

mittee be reconsidered.

     Mr Lords, Ladies, akd Gentlemen,

As this is the lirst time that the British Association for the Advancement
of Science has met in the City of Exeter, and it is probable that many now
present have never attended a former Meeting, I hope the okler members of
the Association will bear Avitli me if I say a few words in explanation of the
objects for which the Association was instituted. In the first place, then,
it aims at fulfilling an office which is quite distinct from that of the various
scientific societies which are established in different parts of the coimtry.
These, for the most part, have for their leading object to make the volun-

tary labours of isolated workers in science available to the scientific Avorld

generally by receiving, discussing, and publishing the results which they may

have obtained. The British Association, on the other hand, aims at giving
a more systematic direction to scientific inquiry, and that in various ways.

   In a rapidly progressing branch of science it is by no means easy to become
acquainted with its actual state. The workers in it are scattered throughout
the civilized world, and their results are published in a variety of Transac-
tions and scientific periodicals, mixed with other scientific matter. To make
oneself, without assistance, well acquainted with what has been done, it is
requisite to have access to an extensive library, to be able to read with faci-
lity several modern languages, and to have leisure to hunt through the tables
of contents, or at least the indices, of a number of serial works. Without

such knowledge, there is always the risk that a scientific man may spend his
strength in doing over again what has been done already ; whereas with

better direction the same expenditure of time and labour might have resulted
in some substantial addition to our knowledge. With a view to meet this

difficulty, the British Association has requested individuals who were more
specially conversant with particular departments of science, to draw up re-

ports on the present state of our knowledge in, or on the recent progress of, spe-
cial branches ; and the influence of the Association as a public body has been

found sufficient to induce a number of scientific men to undertake the great

labour of preparing such reports.

    By thus ascertaining thoroughly what we already had, what we still
wanted was made more clear ; and, indeed, it was one special object of the
reports I have mentioned to point out what were the more prominent desi-
XC REPORT 18G9.

derata in the various subjects to which they related. The Association Avas

thus the better enabled to fulfil another of its functions, that of organizing

means for the prosceiition of researches -which require cooperation. When

the want is within the compass of what can be accomplished by individuals,

the demand may be left to create the supply ; but it often happens that a

research can hardly be carried out without cooperation. It may, for instance,
require a combination of the most profound theoretical knowledge with the
greatest experimental skill, or an extensive knowledge of very dissimilar
branches of science ; or, again, the work to be done, though all of one kind,

may be of such an extent as to be beyond the power of any one man. In

such cases the limited power of the individual can only be supplemented by
the principle of cooperation ; and accordingly it becomes an important part
of the business of the Association to organize committees for the prosecution
of special researches. The researches thus undertaken at the request of the
Association are published at length, along with the reports on the progress
of science, in the first part of the annual volume.

    In close connexion with the last must be mentioned another mode in which

the Association contributes to the progress of science. Many researches re-

quire not only time and thought, but pecuniary outlay ; and it would seem

hard that scientific men who give their time and labour gratuitously to car-

rying out such researches should be further obliged to incur an expenditure
which they often can ill afford. The Association accordingly makes grants
of money to individuals or Committees for defraying the expenses of such
researches. It appears from the I'cport which has just been published that,
reckoning up to the year 1867 inclusi\e, the sum of i'29,312 -is. Id, has been
voted by the Association for various scientific olijccts. Deducting from tliis

the sum of =£23 IGs. 0(/. for the balances of grants not wholly expended,
which were returned to the Association, we may say that =£29,288 8s. Id.

has been expended in the manner indicated. When we remember that these

grants were mostly of small amount, and do not include personal expenses,

and that verj'' many of the researches undertaken at the request of the Asso-
ciation do not involve money grants at all, we may form some idea of the
amount of scientific activitj^ which has been evoked under the auspices of the

Association.

    In the address with which the business of the Meeting is opened, it is
usual for your President to give some account of the most recent progress of

science. The task is by no means an easy one. Pew indeed are familiar
with science in all its branches ; and even to one who was, the selection of

topics and the mode of treating them would still present difficulties. I shall

not attempt to give an account of the recent progress of science in general,

but shall select from those branches witli Avhich I am more familiar some

examples of recent progress which may, I hope, prove to be of pretty general

interest. And even in this I feel that I shall have to crave your indulgence,

for it is hard to be intelligible to some Avithout being wearisome to others.

   Among the various branches of physical science, astronomy occupies in many

respects a foremost rank. The movements of the heavenly bodies must have
 occupied the attention and excited the interest of mankind from the earliest
 ages, and accordingly the first rudiments of the science are lost in the depths
of antiquity. The grandeur of the subjects of contemplation Avhich it pre-
sents to us have won for it especial favour, and its importance in relation to
navigation has caused it to be supported by national resources. Newton's
great discovery of universal gravitation raised it from the rank of a science
X)f observation to that of ocie 3.diniJ;fing of the most exact mathematical de-
                                                                          ;

duction ; and llic investigation of the consequences of this law, and the
explanation thereby of the lunar and planetary disturbances, have afforded

a iield for the exercise of the highest mathematical powers on the part of

Newton and bis successors. Gradually the apparent anomalies, as they

might have been deemed, in the motions of the heavenly bodies were shown

to be necessary consequences of the one fundamental law ; and at last, as the

result of calculations of enormous labour, tables were constructed enabling

the places of those bodies at any given time to be determined years before-

Ahand with astonishing precision.  still more striking step was taken.

AYhen it had been shown by careful calculation that the apparent motion of

the remotest of the planets then known to belong to our system could not

be wholly explained on the theory of gravitation, by taking account of the
disturbing powers of the other known planets, Adams in our own country,

and Le Verrier in France, boldly reversed the problem, and instead of

determining the disturbing effect of a known planet, set themselves to inquire

what miist be the mass and orbit of an unknown planet which shall be capa-

ble of producing by its disturbing force the unexplained deviations in the

position of Uranus from its calculated place. The result of this inquiry is

too well known to reqiiire notice.
   After these brilliant achievements, some may perhaps have been tempted

to imagine that the field of astronomical research must have been well-nigh

exhausted. Small perturbations, hitherto overlooked, might be determined,

and astronomical tables thereby rendered still more exact. New asteroids

might be discovered by the telescope. More accurate values of the con-

stants with which we have to deal might be obtained. But no essential

novelty of principle was to be looked for in the department of astronomy

for such we must go to younger and less mature branches of science.

Eesearches which have been carried on within the last few years, even

the pi'ogress which has been made within the last twelve months, shows

how short-sighted such an anticipation would have been ; what an unex-

pected flood of light may sometimes be thrown over one science by its union

with another ; how conducive accordingly to the advancement of science

may be an Association like the present, in which not only are the workers

at special sciences brought together in the Sectional Meetings, but in the

General Meetings of the Association, and in the social intercourse, which,

though of an informal character, is no unimportant part of our procedings
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

the cultivators of different branches of science are brought together, and

have an opportunity of enlarging their minds by contact with the minds of

others, who have been used to trains of thought of a very different character

from their own.

The science of astronomy is indebted to that of optics for the principles

whch regulate the construction of those optical instruments which are so

essential to the astronomer. It repaid its debt by furnishing to optics a

result which it is important we should keep in view in considering the
nature of light. It is to astronomy that we are indebted for the first proof

we obtained of the finite velocity of light, and for the first numerical deter-

mination of that enormous velocity. Astronomy, again, led, forty-four years

later, to a second determination of that velocity in the remarkable pheno-
menon of aberration discovered by Bradley, a phenomenon presenting spe-

cial points of interest in relation to the nature of light, and which has given

rise to some discussion, extending even to the present day, so that the Astro-

nomer Eoyal has not deemed it unworthy of investigation, laborious as he

foresees the trial is likely to prove, to determine the constant of aberration

by means of a telescope having its tube fiUed with water.

                         REPORT 1869.

If in respect of these phenomena optics received much aid from astro-

nomy, the latter science has been indebted to the former for information

which could not otherwise have been obtained. The motions and the masses

of the heavenly bodies are revealed to us more or less fully by astronomical

observations; but we could not thus become acquainted with the chemical

nature of these distant objects. Yet, by the api^lication of the spectroscope

to the scrutiny of the heavenly bodies, evidence has been obtained of the

existence therein of various elements known to us by the chemical examina-

tion  of the  materials  of which  our  own  earth is  composed                                      and  not  only
                                                                                                  ;

so, but light is thrown on the state in which matter is there existing, which,

in the case of nebuloe especially, led to the formation of new ideas respecting

their constitution, and the rectification of astronomical speculations pre-

viously entertained. I shall not, however, dwell further on this part of the

subject, which is now of some years' standing, and has been mentioned by

more than one of j'our former Presidents, but will pass on to newer re-

searches in the same direction.
   "We are accustomed to apply to the stars the e]}ithei fixed. Night after

night they are seen to have the same relative arrangement ; and when their

places are determined by careful measurement, and certain small correc-

tions due to known causes are applied to the immediate results of observa-
tion, they are found to have the same relative distances. But when instead

of days the observations extend over months or years, it is found that the

fixity is not quite absolute. Defining as fixity invariabihty of position as
estimated with reference to the stars as a whole, and comparing the posi-

tion of any individual star with those of the stars in its neighbourhood, we

find that some of the stars exhibit " proper motions," show, that is, a pro-
gressive change of angular position as seen from the earth, or rather as they

would be seen from the sun, which we may take for the mean annual place

of the earth. This indicates linear motion in a direction transverse to the
line joining the sun with the star. IJiit since our sun is merely a star, a

line drawn from the star exhibiting proper motion to our sun is, as regards

the former, merely a line drawn to a star taken at random, and therefore

there is no reason why the star's motion should be, except accidentally, in a

Wedirection perpendicular to the line joining the star witli our sun.                                          must

conclude that the stars, inchiding our own sun, or some of them at least,

are moving in various directions in space, and that it is merely the trans-
versal component of the whole motion, or rather of the motion relatively
to our sun, that is revealed to us by a change in the star's apparent place.

  How then shall we determine Avhether any particular star is approaching

to or receding from our sun ? It is clear that astronomy alone is powerless
to aid us here, since such a motion would be unaccompanied by change of
angular position. Here the science of optics comes to our aid in a remark-

able manner.

   The pitch of a musical note depends, as we know, on the number of

vibrations which reach the ear in a given time, such as a second. Sup-

pose, now, that a body, such as a bell, which is vibrating a given num-

ber of times per second, is at the same time moving from the observer, the
air being calm. Since the successive pulses of sound travel all with the

velocity of sound, but diverge from different centres, namely, the successive

points in the bell's path at which the bell was when those pulses were first
excited, it is evident that the sound-waves will be somewhat more spread

out on the side from which the bell is moving, and more crowded together

on the side towards which it is moving, than if the IjcU had been at rest.
ADDRESS.  XCm

Consequently the number of vibrations per second which reach the ear of an
observer situated in the former of these directions will be somewhat smaller,
and the number which reach an observer situated in the opposite direction
somewhat greater, than if the bell had been at rest. Hence to the former
the pitch will be somewhat lower, and to the latter somewhat higher, than
the natural pitch of the bell. And the same thing will happen it the ob-

server be in motion instead of the bell, or if both be in motion ; in fact, the
effect depends only on the relative motion of the observer and the bell in

--the direction of ^ line joining the two, in other words, on the velocity of

recession or approach of the observer and the bell. Tlie effect may be per-
ceived in standing by a railway when a train in which the steam-whistle is

sounding passes by at full speed, or better still, if the observer be seated in
a train which is simidtaneously moving in the opposite direction.

   The present state of optical science is such as to furnish us with evidence,
of a force which is perfectly overwhelming, that light consists of a tremor or
vibratory movement propagated in an elastic medium filling the planetary
and stellar spaces, a medium which thus fulfils for light an office similar to
that of air for sound. In this theory, to difference of periodic time corresponds
difference of refrangibility. Suppose that we were in possession of a source

of light capable, like the bell in the analogous case of sound, of exciting in
the [Ether supposed at rest vibrations of a definite period, corresponding,
therefore, to light of a definite refrangibility. Then, just as in the ease of
sound, if the source of light and the observer were receding from or approach-

ing to each other with a velocity which was not insensibly small compared
with the velocity of light, an appreciable lowering or elevation of refrangibi-
lity would be produced, which would be cajiable of detection by means of a
spectroscope of high dispersive power.

    The velocity of light is so enormous, about 185,000 miles per second, that
it can readily be imagined that any motion wliich we can experimentally
produce in a source of light is as rest in comparison. But the earth in its
orbit round the sun moves at the rate of about IS miles per second ; and in
the motions of stars approaching to or receding from our sun we might expect
to meet with velocities comparable with this. The orbital velocity of the

earth is, it is true, onlj^ about the one ten-thousandth part of the velocity of
light. Still the effect of such a velocity on the refrangibility of light, which

 admits of being easily calculated, jiroves not to be so insensibly small as to

 elude all chance of detection, provided only the observations are conducted
with extreme delicacy.

    Eut how shall we find in such distant objects as the stars an analogue of
the bell which we have assumed in the illustration drawn from sound?
AVhat evidence can we ever obtain, even if an examination of their light

 should present us with rays of definite refrangibility, of tlie existence in those

remote bodies of ponderable matter vibrating in known periods not identical
with those corresponding to the refrangibilities of the definite rays which we
 observe? The answer to this question will involve a reference, which I will
 cndeavo\ir to make as brief as I can, to the splendid researches of Professor
 Xirchhoff. The exact coincidence of certain dark lines in the solar spectrum
 with bright lines in certain artificial sources of light had previously been in
 one or two instances observed ; but it is to Kirchhoff we owe the inference
 from an extension of Prcvost's theory of exchanges, that a glowing medium

 which emits bi'ight light of any particular refraugibility necessarily (at that
 temperature at least) acts as an absorbing medium, exting-uishing light of the
 same refrangibility. In saying this it is but just to mention that in relation
       !

Xciv                          --REPORT 1869.

to radiant heat (from whence the transition to light is easy), Kirchhoff was

jjreceded, though unconsciously, by our own countryman Mr. Balfour Stewart.

The inference which Kirchhoff drew from Provost's theorj^ thus extended led

him to make a careful comparison of the places of the dark lines of the solar

spectrum with those of bright lines produced by the incandescent gas or

vapour of known elements ; and the coincidences were in many cases so re-

markable as to eataljlish almost to a certaintj' the existence of several of the

known elements in the solar atmosphere, producing by their absorbing action

the dark lines coinciding with the bright lines observed. Among other

elements may be mentioned in particular hydrogen, the spectrum of which,

when the gas is traversed by an electric discharge, shows a bright line or band

exactly coinciding with the dark line C, and another with the line F.

  Now Mr. Huggins found that several of the stars show in their spectra

dark lines coinciding in position with C and F ; and what strengthens the

belief that this coincidence, or apparent coincidence, is not merely fortui-

tous, but is due to a common cause, is that the two lines are found asso-
ciated together, both present or both absent. And Kirchhoff's theory suggests

that the common cause is the existence of hydrogen in the atmospheres of

the sun and certain stars, and its exercise of an absorbing action on the light

emitted from beneath.

  Now by careful and repeated observations with a telescope furnished with

a spectroscope of high dispersive power, Mr. Huggins found that the F line,

the one selected for observation, in the spectrum of Sirius did not exactly

coincide with the corresponding bright line of a hydrogen spark, which latter

agrees in position with the solar F, but was a little less refrangible, while

preserving the same general appearance. AVhat conclusion, then, are we

to draw from the result? Surely it would be most unreasonable to attri-

bute the dark lines in the spectra of the sun and of Sirius to distinct causes,

and to regard their almost exact coincidence as purely fortuitous, when we

have in proper motion a vera causa to account for a minute difference. And

if, as Kirchhoff's labours render almost certain, the dark solar lino depends

on the existence of hydrogen in the atmosphere of our sun, we are led to

infer that that element, with which the chemist working in his laboratory is

so familiar, exists and is siibject to the same physical laws in that distant

star, so distant, that, judging by the most probable value of its annual paral-

lax, light which would go seven times round our earth in one second would

take fourteen years to travel from the star. What a grand conception of the

unity of plan pervading the universe do such conclusions present to our

minds

   Assuming, then, that the small difference of refrangibility observed be-

tween the solar F and that of Sirius is duo to proper motion, Mr. Huggins

concludes from his measures of the minute difference of position that at the

time of the observation Sirius was receding from the earth at the rate of 41*4

Amiles per second.  part of this was due to the motion of the earth in its

orbit ; and on deducting the orbital velocity of the earth, resolved in the direc-

tion of a lino drawn from the star, there remained 29'4 miles per second as

the velocity with which Sirius and our sun are mutually receding from each

other. Considering the minuteness of the quantity on which the result de-

pends, it is satisfactory to find that Mr. Huggins's results as to the motion of

Sirius have been confirmed by the observations of Father Secchi made at Rome

with a different instrument.

The determination of radial proper motion in this way is still in its infancy.

It is worthy of note that, unlike the detection of transversal proper motion.
ADDRESS.  XCV

by change of angular position, it is equally applicable to stars at all distances,
provided they arc bright enough to render the obsei'vations possible. It is

conceivable that the results of these observations may one day lead to a de-

termination of the motion of the solar system in space, which is more trust-
worthy than that which has been deduced from changes of position, as being
founded on a broader induction, and not confined to conclusions derived fi-om

the stars in our neighbourhood. Should even the solar system and the nearer
stars be drifting along, as Sir John Herschel suggests, with an approximately

common motion, like motes in a sunbeam, it is conceivable that the circum-
stance might thus be capable of detection. To what wide speculations are we
led as to the possible i^rogress of our knowledge when we put together what

has been accomplished in difterent branches of science !

   I turn now to another recent application of spectral analysis. The pheno-
menon of a total solar eclipse is described by those who have seen it as one of
the most imposing that can be witnessed. The rarity of its occurrence and

the shortness of its duration afford, however, opportunity for only a hasty

study of the phenomena which may then present themselves. Among these,

one of the most remarkable, seen indeed before, but first brought prominently

into notice by the observers who watched the eclipse of July 7, 1842, consists

in a series of mountain-like or cloud-like luminous objects seen outside the
dark disk of the moon. These have been seen in subsequent total eclipses,

and more specially studied, by means of photogi-aphy, by Mr. Warren De La

Tluc in the eclipse of June 18, 1860. The result of the various observations,
and especially the study, which could be made at leisure, of the photographs
obtained by Mr. De La Eue, proved conclusively that these appendages belong
to the sun, not to the moon. The photographs proved further their light to
be remarkable for actinic power. Since that time the method of spectral
analysis has been elaborated ; and it seemed likely that additional informa-
tion bearing on the nature of these objects might be obtained by the applica-
tion of the sjjectroscope. Accordingly various expeditions were equipped for
the pitrpose of obsemug the total solar ecHpse which was to happen on

August 17, 1868. In o\ir own country an equatorially mounted telescope

provided witli a spectroscope was procured for the purpose by the Eoyal
Society, which was entrusted to Lieut, (now Captain) Herschel, who was going
out to India, one of the countries crossed by the line of tlie central sha-
dow. Another expedition was organized by the Royal Astronomical Society,

under the auspices of Major Teunant, who was foremost in pressing on the
attention of scientific men the importance of avaihug themselves of the

opportunity.

    Shortly before the conclusion of the Meeting of the Association at Norwich
last year, the first results of the observations were made knov\ni to the Meet-
ing through the agency of the electric telegraph. In a telegram sent by
M. Jansseu to the President of the Eoyal Society, it was announced that the
spectrum of the prominences was very remarkable, showing bright lines,
while that of the corona showed none. Brief as the message necessarily was,
one point was settled. The prominences could not be clouds in the strict

sense of the term, shining either by virtue of their own heat, or by light
reflected from below. They must consist of incandescent matter in the
gaseous form. It appeared from the more detailed accounts received by

post from the various observers, and put together at leisure, that except in
the immediate neighbourhood of the sun the light of the prominences con-
sisted mainly of three bright lines, of which two coincided, or nearly so,
with C and P, and the intermediate one nearly, but, as subsequent researches
      -- ;:

XCvi  REPORT 1869.

showed, not exactly, with D. The bright linos coinciding with C and F

indicate the presence of glowing hydrogen.
    This is precious information to have gathered during the brief interval of

the total phase, and required on the part of the observers self-denial in with-
drawing the eye from the imposing spectacle of the surrounding scenery, and
coolness in proceeding steadily with some definite part of the inquiry,

when so many questions crowded for solution, and the fruits of months of

preparation were to be reaped in three or four minutes or lost altogether
especially when, as too often happened, the observations were provokingly

interrupted by flying clouds.

   But valuable as these observations were, it is obvious that we should have
had long to wait before we could have became acquainted with the .usual
behaviour of these objects, and tlieir possible relation to changes which may be
going on at the surface of the sun, if we had been dependent on the rare and
brief phenomenon of a total solar ecHpse for gathering information respecting
them. But how, the (juestion might be asked, shall we ever be able so to

subdue the overpowering glare of our great luminary, and the dazzling

illumination which it produces in our atmosphere when we look nearly in its

direction, as to perceive objects which are comparatively so faint ? Here

again the science of optics comes in aid of astronomy.

   When a line of light, such as a narrow slit held in front of a luminous ob-

ject, is viewed through a prism, the light is ordinarily spread out into a

coloured band, the length of which may be increased at pleasure by substitu-

ting two or more prisms for the single prism. As the total quantity of light is
not thereby increased, it is obvious that the intensity of the hght of the
coloured band will go on decreasing as the Iwigth increases. Such is the case

with ordinary sources of light, like the flame of a caudle or the sky, wliich
give a continuous spectrum, or one generally continuous, though interrupted
by dark bands. But if the light from the source be homogeneous, consisting,
that is, of light of one degree of refrangibility only, the image of the slit

win be merely deviated by the prisms, not widened out into a band, and not
consequently reduced in intensity by the dispersion. And if the source of

light emit light of both kinds, it will be easily understood that the images of
the sht corresponding to light of any definite refrangibiUties which the mix-

ture may contain wiU stand out, by their superior intensity, on the weaker

ground of the continuous spectrum.
    Preparations for observations of the kind had long been in progress in the

hands of our countryman Mr. Lockycr. His first attempts were unsuccessful

but undismayed by failure, he ordered the coiistruction of a new spectroscope
of superior power, in wliich he was aided by a grant from the sum placed annu-

ally by Parliament at the disposal of the lloyal Society for scientific purposes.
The execution of this instrument was delayed by Avhat proved to be the last
illness of tbe eminent optician to -nhom it had been in the first instance en-

trusted, the late Mr. Cooke ; but when at last the instrument was placed in his
hands, Mr. Lockyer was not long in discovering the object of his two years'
search. On the 20th of October last year, in examining the space immediately
surrounding the edge of the solar disk, he obtained evidence, by the occiirrence
of a bright line in the spectrum, that his slit was on the image of one of

those prominences, the nature of which had so long been an enigma. It
further appeared from an observation made on November 5 (as indeed might

be expected from the photographs of Mr. De La Eue, and the descriptions of
those who had observed total solar eclipses) that the prominences were merely

 elevated portions of an extensive luminous stratum of the same general cha-
                        ADDRESS.                                      XCVll

racter, wliicli, noAV that the necessity of tlie interposition of the moon -was

dispensed with, coiild be traced complctclj^ round the sun. Notices of this

discovery were received from the author by the lioyal Societ}'- on October 21

and November 3, and the former was ahnost immediately published in No. 105
of the Proceedings. These were shortly afterwards followed by a fuller paper

on the same subject.

Meanwhile the same thing had been independently observed in another

part of the world. After having observed the remarkable spectrum of the

prominences during the total eclipse, it occurred to IT. Jaussen that the same

method might allow the prominences to be detected at any time ; and on trial
he succeeded in detecting them the very day after the ecHpse. The results of

liis observations were sent by post, and were received shortly after the
account of ilr. Lockyer's discovery had been communicated by Mr. De La Hue

to the French Academy.

In the way hitherto described a prominence is not seen as a whole, but

the observer knows when its image is intercepted by the slit ; and by vary-

ing a little the position of the slit a series of sections of the prominence are

obtained, by putting which together the form of the prominence is deduced.

Shortly after Mr. Lockyer's communication of his discovery, Mr. Huggins,

who had been independently engaged in the attempt to render the promi-

nences visible by the aid of the spectroscope, siicceeded in seeing a pro-

minence as a whole by somewhat ·svidening the slit, and using a red glass to

diminish the glare of the light admitted by the slit, the prominence being

seen by means of the C line in the red. Mr. Lockyer had a design for see-

ing the prominences as a whole by giving the slit a rapid motion of small

extent, but this proved to be superfluous, and they are now habitually seen
with their actual forms. Nor is our power of observing them restricted to

those which are so situated that they are seen by projection outside the sun's

limb ; such is the j^ower of the spectroscopic method of observation that it has
enabled Mr. Lockj-er and others to observe them right on the disk of the sun,

an important step for connecting them with other solar phenomena.

One of the most striking results of the habitual study of these prominences

is the evidence they afford of the stupendous changes which are going on in

the centi'al body of our system. Prominences the heights of which are to be

measiired by thousands and tens of thousands of mUes, ajipear and disappear

in the course of some minutes. And a study of certain minute changes of

position in the bright line F, which receive a simple and natural explanation

by referring them to proper motion in the glowing gas by which that line is

produced, and which we see no other way of accounting for, have led Mr,

Lockyer to conclude that the gas in question is sometimes travelling with

velocities comparable with that of the earth in its orbit. Moreover these ex-

hibitions of intense action are frequently found to be intimately connected

with the spots, and can hardly fail to throw light on the disputed question
of their formation. Nor are chemical composition and proper motion the only

physical conditions of the gas which are accessible to spectral analysis. Ey

comparing the breadth of the bright bands (for though narrow they are not

mere lines) seen in the prominences with those observed in the spectrum of

hydrogen rendered incandescent under different phj'sical conchtions. Dr.

Fraukland and Mr. Lockyer have deduced conchisions respecting the pressure

to which tlie gas is subject in the neighbourhood of the sun. I am happy to

say that Mr. Lockyer has consented to deliver a discourse during our Meeting,

in which the whole subject will doubtless be fully explained.

I have dwelt perhaps too long on this topic, and I cannot help fearing that

I may have been tcdioiis to the many scientific men to whom the subject is

already perfectly familiar. Yet the contemplations which it opens out to us

are so exalted, and the proof which it affords of what can be accomplished

by the union of diiferent branches of science is so striking, that I hope I

may be pardoned for occupying yoiir time. I cannot, however, leave the

subject of Astronomy without congratulating the Association on the accom-

plishment of an object which originated with it, and in the promotion of

which it formerly took an active part. It was at the Meeting of the Asso-

ciation at Birmingham in 1849, under the presidency of the Eev. Dr. Robinson,

that a resoliition was passed for making an application to Her Majesty's

Government to estabhsh a reflector of not less than three feet aperture at the

Cape of Good Hope, and to make such additions to the staff of that obser-

vatory as might be necessary for its effectual working. This resolution met

with the hearty concurrence of the President of the Council of the Royal

Society, who suggested that the precise locaHty in tlie Southern hemisphere

where the telescope should be erected had best be left an open question.

This modification having been adopted by your Council, the application was

presented to Earl RusseU, then First Lord of the Treasury, by representatives

Aof both bodies early in 1850.  reply was received from Government to

the effect that though they agreed mth the Association as to the interest

which attached itself to the inquiry, yet there was so much difficulty attend-

ing the arrangements that they were not prepared to take any steps without

much further enquiry. This reply was considered so far favourable as not to

forbid the hope of success if the apphcation were renewed on a suitable

opportunity. The subject was again brought before the Association by

Colonel (now General Sir Edward) Sabine, in his opening address as Presi-

dent at the Belfast Meeting in 1852. The result was that the matter was

again brought before Government by a Committee of the British Association

acting in conjunction with a Committee of the Royal Society, by means of an

application made to the Earl of Aberdeen. By this time the country was

engaged in the Russian war, in consequence of which, it was replied, no

funds could then be spared ; but a promise was given that when the crisis

then impending was past, the matter should be taken up, a promise which

the retirement from office and subsequent death of Lord Aberdeen rendered

of no avail.

But though failing in its immediate object, the action of the British Asso-

Aciation in this matter has not remained fruitless.  few years later the

subject was warmly taken up at Melbourne, and after preliminary corre-

spondence between the Board of Visitors of the Melbourne Observatory and

the President and Council of the B-oyal Society, and the appointment by the

latter body of a Committee to consider and report on the subject, in April

1864 a proposition was made to the Colonial Legislature for a grant of

£5000 for the construction of a telescope, and was acceded to. Not to

weary you with details, I wiU merely say that the telescope has been con-

structed by Mr. Grubb, of Dublin, and is now erected at Melbourne, and in the

hands of Mr. Le Sueur, who has been appointed to use it. It is a reflector

of four feet aperture, of the Cassegrain construction, equatorially mounted,

and provided with a clock-movement. Before its shipment, it was inspected

in Dublin by the Committee appointed by the Royal Society to consider the

best mode of carrying out the object for which the vote was made by the

Melbourne Legislatnre ; and the Committee speak in the highest terms of its

contrivance and execution. "We may expect before long to get a first instal-

ment of the results obtained by a scrutiny of the southern heavens with an

--instrument far more powerful than any that has hitherto been applied to

them results -which will at the same time add to our existing knowledge
and redound to the honour of tho Colony, by whose liberality this long-

cherished object has at last been effected.
   As I have mentioned an application to the Government on the part of

the Association which was not successful, it is but right to say that such is
not generally the result ; I wiU refer to one instance. At the Cambridge
Meeting of the Association in 1862, a Committee, consisting of representa-
tives of the Mechanical and Chemical Sections, was appointed for the pur-
pose of investigating the application of gun-cotton to warlike purposes. At
the Newcastle Meeting, in the following year, this Committee presented
their Report. It was felt that a complete study of the subject demanded
appliances which could be obtained only from our military resources, and
at the Newcastle Meeting a resolution was passed recommending the ap-
pointment of a Royal Commission. This recommendation was adopted, and
in 186-1 a Commision was appointed, which was requested to report on the
application of gun-cotton to Civil as well as to Naval and Military purposes.
The Committee gave in their report last year, and that report, together with
a more recent return relative to the application of gun-cotton to mining and
quarrying operations, has just been printed for the House of Commons.

  A substance of such comparatively recent introduction cannot be fairly

compared with an explosive in the use of which we have the experience

of centuries. Yet, even with oiu* present experience, there are some pur-
poses for which gun-cotton can advantageously replace gunpowder, while
its manufacture and storage can be effected with comparative safety, since it
is in a wet state diiring the process of manufacture, and is not at all injured
by being kept permanently in water, but merely reqxiires to be dried for use.
Even shoidd it be required to store it in the dry state, it is doubtfid. whether,
with the precautions indicated by the chemical investigations of Mr. Abel,
any greater risk is incurred than in the case of gunpowder. In the blasting
of hard rocks it is found to be" highly efficient, while the remarkable results

recently obtained by Mr. Abel leave no doubt of its value for explosions such

as are frequently required in warfare. General Hay speaks highly of the
promise of its value for smaU arms ; but many more experiments are re-
quired, especially as a change in the arm and mode of ignition require a

change in the construction of the cartridge. In heavy ordnance, the due

control of the rapidity of combustion of the substance is a matter of greater

difficulty ; and, though considerable progress has been made, much remains

to be done before the three conditions of safety to the gun, high velocity of

projection, and uniformity of result, are satisfactorily combined.

   By the kindness of Dr. Carpenter, I am enabled to mention to you the

latest results obtained in an expedition which coiild not have been under-
taken without the aid of Government, an aid which was freely given. Last
year Dr. Carpenter and Professor Wyville Thomson represented to the Pre-
 sident and Council of the Royal Society the great importance to Zoology
 and Palaeontology of obtaining soundings from great depths in the ocean,
 and suggested to them to use their influence with the Admiralty to induce
them to place a gun-boat, or other suitable vessel, at the disposal of those
gentlemen and any other naturalists who might be willing to accompany
them for the purpose of carrying on a systematic course of deep-sea dredg-
ing for a month or six weeks. This application was forwarded to the Ad-

miralty with the warm support of the President and Council, and was readily

 acceded to. The operations were a good deal impeded by roiagh weather,

                                                                           9^

but nevertheless important results were obtained. Dredging was successfully

accomplished at a depth of 650 fathoms ; and the existence was established

of a varied and abundant submarine Fauna, at depths which had generally-

been supposed to be either azoic, or occupied by animals of a very low type

and the character of the Fauna and of the mud brought up was such as to

point to a chalk formation actually going on.

It seemed desirable to carry the soundings to still greater depths, and to

examine more fully the changes of temperature which had been met with in

the descent. Another application was accordingly made to the Admiralty in

the present year, and was no less readily acceded to than the former ; and a

lar"-er vessel than that used last year is now on her cruize. I am informed

by Dr. Carpenter that dredging has been successfully carried down to more

than 2400 fathoms (nearly the height of Mont Blanc), and that animal Ufe

has been found even at that depth in considerable varieti/, though its amount

and hind are obviously influenced by the reduction of temperature to Arctic

Acoldness.  very careful series of temperature soundings has been taken,

showing, on the same spot, a continuous descent of temperature with the

depth, at first more rapid, afterwards pretty uniform. Thermometers pro-

tected from pressure by a plan devised by Dr. Miller were found to main-

tain their character at the great depths reached, the difference between them

and the best ordinary thermometers used in the same sounding being exactly

conformable to the pressure corresponding with each depth, as determined by
the experiments previously made in smaller depths. All the observations

hitherto made go to confirm the idea of a general interchange of polar and

equatorial water, the former occupying the lowest depths, the latter forming
a superficial stratum of 700 or 800 fathoms. The analyses of the water

brought up indicate a large proportion of carbonic acid in the gases of the

deep waters, and a general diffusion of organic matter.
   I must turn for a few moments to another application recently made to

Government, which has not been successful. The application I have iu_

view was made, not by the British Association or other Scientific Societies

in their corporate capacity, but by a body composed of the Presidents of the

British Association  and  of  the  Royal and  other leading  Scientific Societies
                                                                                                                              ;

and its object was, not the promotion of Science directly, but the recognition,

of preeminent scientific merit. In the history of science few names, indeed,
hold so prominent a place as that of Faraday. The perfect novelty of prin-

ciple and recondite nature of many of his great discoveries are such as to

bear the impress of genius of the highest order, and to form an epoch in the

advance of science; and while his scientific labours excited tlie admiration,

of men of science throughout the world, his singularl}- genial disposition,
and modest imassuming character, won for him the love of those who had
the happiness of numbering him among their personal friends. At a

meeting of the Presidents of the Scientific Societies [to which I have al-

luded, it was resolved to erect a statue in memory of Faraday. He
was a man of whom England may well be proud, and it was thought

that it would be a graceful recognition of his merits if the monument

were erected at the public expense. The present Chancellor of the Ex-

chequer, however, did not think it right tliat the recognition of scien-

tific merit, however eminent, should fall on the taxation of the country,

though even in a pecuniary point of view the country has received so much

benefit from the labours of scientific men. The carrying oiit of the resolu-

tion being thus left to private exertion, a public meeting, pi'csided over by

H.R.H. the Prince of Walesj was held in the Koyal Institution, an establishment

which has the honoui' of beiug identified with Faraday's scientific career.

At this Meeting a Committee was formed to carry out the object, and a sub-
scription list commenced. By permission of the Secretaries of this Asso-

ciation, an office has been opened in the reception-room, where those Mem-
bers of the Association who may be desirous of taking part in the movement

^Yill have every facility afforded them.

   In chemistry, I do not believe that any great step has been made within

the last year ; but perhaps there is no science in which an earnest worker
is so sure of being rewarded by making some substantial acquisition to

our knowledge, though it may not be of the nature of one of those grand

discoveries which from time to time stamp their- impress on difi'erent branches

of science. I may be permitted to refer to one or two discoveries which are
exceedingly curious, and some of which may prove of considerable practical

importance.

The Turaco or Plantain-eater of the Cape of Good Hope is celebrated for

Aits beautiful plumage.  portion of the wings is of a fine red colour. This

red colouring-matter has been investigated by Professor Church, who finds it

to contain nearlj- six per cent, of copper, which cannot be distinguished by

the ordinary tests, nor removed from the colouring-matter without destroying
it. The colouring-matter is in fact a natural organic compound of which
copper is one of the essential constituents. Traces of this metal had pre-

viously been found in animals, for example, in oysters, to the cost of those

who partook of them. But in these cases the pi'csence of the copper was

merely accidental ; thus oysters that lived near the mouths of streams which
came down from copper-mines assimilated a portion of the copper salt, with-

out apparently its doing them either good or harm. But in the Turaco the

existence of the red colouring-matter which belongs to their normal plumage

is dejiendent uj^on copper, which, obtained in minute quantities with the food,

is stored up in this strange manner in the sj^stem of the animal. Thus in

the very same feather, partly red and partly black, copper was- found in

abundance in the red parts, but none or only the merest trace in the black.

This example warns us against taking too utilitarian a view of the plan

of creation. Here we have a chemical substance elaborated which is per-

fectly unique in its nature, and contains a metal the salts of which are ordi-

narily regarded as poisonous to animals ; and the sole purpose to which, so

far as we know, it is subservient in the animal economy is one of pure deco-

ration. Thus a pair of the birds which were kept in captivity lost their fine

red colour in the course of a few days, in consequence of washing in the

water which was left them to drink, the red colouring-matter, which is

soluble in water, being thus washed out ; but except as to the loss of their

beauty it does not appear that the birds were the worse for it.

  A large part of tlie calicos which are produced in this country in such enor-

mous quantities are sent out into the market in the printed form. Although
other substances are employed, the place which madder occupies among dye-

stuifs with the eaUco-printer is compared by Mr. Schunck to that which iron

occupies among metals with the engineer. It appears from the public returns

that upwards of 1(J,000 tons of madder are imported annually into tlie

United Kingdom. The colours which madder yields to mordanted cloth

are due to two substances, alizarine and purparine, derived from the

root. Of these, alizarine is deemed the more important, as producing faster

coloui's, and yielding finer violets. In studying the transformations of aliza-

rine under the action of chemical reagents, MM. Graebe and Liebermaun

were led to connect it with anthracene, one of the coal-tar series of bodies.
--cii REPORT 1869.

and to devise a mode of formiug it artificially. The discovery is still

too recent to allow us to judge of the cost with which it can be ob-

tained by artificial formation, which must decide the question of its com-

mercial employment. But assuming it to be thus obtained at a suffi-

ciently cheap rate, what a remarkable example does the discovery afford
of the way in which the philosopher quietly working in his laboratory

may obtain results which revohitionize the industry of nations ! To the
calico-printer indeed it may make no very important difference whether he

continues to use madder, or replaces it by the artificial substance ; but what

a sweeping change is made in the madder-growing interest ! What himdreds

of acres hitherto employed in madder- cultivation are set free for the produc-

tion of human food, or of some other substance useful to man ! Such changes
can hardly be made without temporary inconvenience to those who are in-

terested in the branches of industry aifected; but we mi;st not on that

account attempt to stay the progress of discovery, which is conducive to the

general weal.

   Another example of the way in which practical api)lications unexpectedly
turn up when science is pursued for its own sake is afl:brded by a result

recently obtained by Dr. Matthiessen, in his investigation of the constitution

of the opium bases. He found that by the action of hydrochloric acid on mor-
phia a new base was produced, which as to composition differed from the for-

mer merely by the removal of one equivalent of water. But the physiologi-
cal action of the new base was utterly diflPcrent from that of the original one.
While morphia is a powerful narcotic, the use of which is apt to be followed
by subsequent depression, the new base was found to be free from narcotic

properties, but to be a powerful emetic, the action of which was unattended

by injurious after-effects. It seems likely to become a valuable remedial

agent.

In relation to mechanism, this year is remarkable as being the centenary of

the great invention of our countryman James Watt. It was in the year 1769

that he took out his patent involving the invention of separate condensation,

which is justly regarded as forming the birth of the steam-engine. Little
could even his inventive mind have foreseen the magnitude of the gift he was

conferring on mankind in general, and on his own country more pai-ticularly.

In these days of steamers, power-looms, and railways, it reqiiircs no small

effort to place ourselves in imagination in the condition we should bo in with-

out the steam-engine. It needs no formal celebration to remind Britons of

what they owe to Watt. Of him truly it may be said " si monumentum

re<i uints circumspice."

   With reference to those branches of science in which we are more or less
concerned with the phenomena of life, my own studies give me no right to
address you. I regret this the less because my predecessor and my probable

successor in the Presidential Chair are both of well-known eminence in this

department. But I hope I may be permitted as a physicist, and viewing the

question from the physical side, to express to you my views as to the rela-

tion which the physical bear to the biological sciences.

 No other physical science has been brought to such perfection as mecha-

_

nics                  and  in  mechanics  we  have  long  been  familiar  with  the  idea  of the  per-
                   ;

fect generality of its laws, of their applicability to bodies organic as well as

inorganic, living as well as dead. Thus in a railway collision when a train is
suddenly arrested the passengers are thrown forward, by virtue of the inertia

of their bodies, precisely according to the laws which regulate the motion of

dead matter. So trite has the idea become that the reference to it may seem
ADDRESS.                                                       cm

childish ; hut from mechanics let us pass on to chemistry, and the case will bo

found by no means so clear. When chemists ceased to be content ^vith the

mere ultimate analysis of organic substances, and set themselves to study

their proximate constituents, a great number of definite chemical compoiinds

·were obtained which could not be formed artificially. I do not know what
may have been the usual opinion at that time among chemists as to their
mode of formation. Probably it may have been imagined that chemical

affinities were indeed concerned in their formation, but controlled and modi-

fied by an assumed vital force. But as the science progressed many of these

organic substances were formed artificially, in some cases from other and

perfectly distinct organic substances, in other cases actually from their ele-

ments. This statement must indeed be accepted with one qualification. It
was stated several years ago by M. Pasteur, and I believe the statement

still remains true, that no substance the solution of which possesses the pro-

perty of rotating the plane of polarization of polarized light had been formed

Nowartificially from substances not possessing that property.  several of the

natural substances which are deemed to have been produced artificially are

active, in the sense of rotating the plane of polarization ; and therefore in

these cases the inactive, artificial substances cannot be absolutely identical

with the natural ones. But the inactivity of the artificial substance is

readily explained on the supposition that the artificial substance bears to the

--natural, the same relation as racemic acid bears to tartaric, that it is, so to

speak, a mixture of the natural substance with its image in a mirror. And
when we remember by what a peculiar and troublesome process M. Pasteur

succeeded in separating racemic acid into the right-handed and left-handed

tartaric acids, it will be at once understood how easily the fact, if it be a

fact, of the existence in the natural substance of a mixture of two substances,

one right-handed and the other left-handed, but otherwise identical, may

have escaped detection. This is a curious point, to the clearing up of which

it is desirable that chemists should direct their attention. Waiving then tho

difference of activity or inactivity, which, as we have seen, admits of a simple

physical explanation, though the correctness of that explanation remains to

be investigated, we may say that at the present time a considerable number

of what used to be regarded as essentially natural organic substances have
been formed in the laboratory. That being the case, it seems most reason-

able to suppose that in the plant or animal from which those organic sub-
stances were obtained they were formed by the play of ordinary chemical

affinity, not necessarily nor probably by the same series of reactions by
which they were formed in the laboratory, where a high temperatm-e is com-
monly employed, but still by chemical reactions of some kind, under the agency
in many cases of light, an agency sometimes employed by the chemist in his

laboratory. And since the boundary line between the natural substances

which have and those which have not been formed artificially is one which,

so far as we know, simply depends upon the amount of our knowledge, and
is continually changing as new processes are discovered, we are led to extend

the same reasoning to the various chemical substances of which organic
structures are made up.

   But do the laws of chemical affinity, to which, as T have endeavoured to infer,
living beings, whether vegetable or animal, are in absolute subjection, together
with those of capillary attraction, of diffusion,and so forth, account for the for-
mation of an organic structure, as distinguished from the elaboration of the che-

mical substances of which it is composed ? No more, it seems to me, than the

laws of motion account for the union of oxygen and hydrogen to form water
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           :

  though the poiidcrahle matter so uniting is subject to the laws of motion
  during the act of union, just as well as before and after. In the various pro-

 cesses of crj'stallization of precipitation, and so forth, which we witness in

  dead matter, I cannot see the faintest shadow of au approach to the forma-
  tion of an organic structure, still less to the wonderful series of changes
 which are concerned iu the growth and perpetuation of even the lowliest
 plant. Admitting to the full as highly probable, though not completely de-
  monstrated, the applicability to living beings of the laws which have been
 ascertained with reference to dead matter, I feel constrained at the same time

--to admit the existence of a mysterious something lying beyond, a something

 sui generis, which I regard, not as balancing and suspending the ordinary
 physical laws, but as working with them and through them to the attainment

 of a designed end.

    What this something, which we call life, may be, is a profound mystery.

 We know not how many links iu the chain of secondary causation may j'^et

 remain behind ; we know not how few. It would be presumptuous indeed to
 assume in any case that we had already reached the last link, and to charge
 with irreverence a fellow-worker who attempted to push his investigations
 yet one step further back. On the other hand, if a thick darkness enshrouds
 all beyond, we have no right to assume it to be impossible that we should have

 reached even the last link of the chain ; a stage where further progress is unat-

 tainable, and we can only refer the highest law at which we stopped to the fiat
 of an Almighty Power. To assume the contrary as a matter of necessity, is prac-
 tically to remove the First Cause of all to an infinite distance from us. The boun-
 dary, however, between what is clearly known and what is veiled in impene-

 trable darkness is not ordinarily thus sharjjly defined. Between the two there
 lies a misty region, in which loom the ill-discerned forms of links of the chain
 which are yet beyond us. But the general principle is not afi'ected thereby.

Let us fearlessly trace the dependence of link on link as far as it may be

given us to trace it, but let us take heed that iu thus studying second causes

we forget not the First Cause, nor shut our eyes to the wonderful proofs of

design which, in the study of organized beings especially, meet us at evcrj'-

turn.

   Truth we know must be self-consistent, nor can one truth contradict
another, even though the two may have been arrived at b}' totally different

processes, in the one case, suppose, obtained by sound scientific investigation,
in the other case taken on trust from duly authenticated witnesses. Misin-

terpretations of course there may be on the one side or on the other, causing
apparent contradictions. Every mathematician knows that in his private
work he will occasionally by two different trains of reasoning arrive at dis-
cordant conclusions. He is at once aware that there must be a slip somewhere,

and sets himself to detect and correct it. AVhen conclusions rest on proba-
ble evidence, the reconciling of apparent contradictions is not so simple and
certain. It requires the exercise of a calm, unbiassed judgment, capable of

looking at both sides of the question ; and oftentimes we have long to sus-

pend our decision, and seek for further evidence. JS'onc need fear the efiect
of scientific inquiry carried on in an honest, truth-loving, humble spirit,

which makes us no less ready frankly to avow our ignorance of what we can-
not explain than to accept conclusions based on sound evidence. The slow but
sure path of induction is open to us. Let us frame hypotheses if we will
most useful are they when kept in their proper place, as stimulating inquiry.

Let us seek to confront them with observation and experiment, thereby con-

firming or upsetting them as the result may prove ; but let us beware of pla-
                         ADDRESS.             CV

cing tlicin prematurely in the rank of ascertained truths, and buikling further

conclusions on them as if they were.

When from the phenomena of life we pass on to those of mind, we enter

Wea region still more profoundly mysterious.  can readily imagine that we

may here be dealing with phenomena altogether transcendiug those of mere

life, in some such way as those of life transcend, as I have endeavoured to

infer, those of chemistry and molecular attractions, or as the laws of chemi-

cal affinity in their turn transcend those of mere mechanics. Science can be

expected to do but little to aid us here, since the instrument of research is

itself the object of investigation. It can but enlighten us as to the depth of

our ignorance, and lead us to look to a higher aid for that which most nearly

concerns our wellbeing.

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

Rejwrt of a Committee appointed at the Nottingham Meeting, 1866,
   for the purpose of Exploring the Plant-beds of North Greenland,
    consisting of Mr. Robert H. Scott, Dr. Hooker, Mr. E. H.

    Whymper, Dr. E. P. Wright, and Sir AV. C. Trevelyan, Bart.*

In their preliminary Report, which was presented to the Association at the
last Meeting, the Committee stated that the sum voted by the Association

had been handed over to Mr. Edward "Whymper, one of their members, who
was in Greenland at the time of the Meeting.

    In the course of the autumn he returned to England, bringing his collection

of fossil plants with him.
   The Committee then resolved to forward the entire collection to Prof. Heer, at

Zurich, for the purposes of identification and description, and they accordingly
made application to the Government-Grant Committee of the Eoyal Society
for a grant of money to pay for the carriage of the specimens to and from

Zurich.

   The Government-Grant Committee, who had formerly assisted the expe-

dition to Greenland by a most liberal grant of money, at once acceded to the
second application, and the fossils were sent to Switzei-land in the course of

last spring (1868).

   As soon as they are sent back, a complete series of the specimens will be
forwarded to the British Museum, in accordance with the conditions laid
down by the Association at the time the money was voted.

   The Committee append hereto Mr. Whymper's Report of his journey,
and a notice forwarded by Prof. Heer, giving an account of the most impor-
tant results obtained by this expedition.

  -- July 1868.

Sir, I arrived at the Colony of Jakobshavn, North Greenland, on the 16th
of June, 1867, but was unable to start for Atanekerdluk, distant northwards
about sixty English miles, before August the 19th. In the meantime I

purchased the only boat that coiild be spared, and obtained as much infor-

mation as possible from the Danes and from the natives respecting the loca-
lities we -were about to visit. From the information so obtained, it was
evident that the fossil stores on the hill of Atanekerdliik had akeady been

well ransacked, and that we could not hope to meet with any great novelties

in that direction. I obtained, however, some amber, through the natives,
from a locality on Disco Island, which had not been examined, and heard of
two other places where fossil wood had been discovered. These places,

Ujarasuksumitok and Kudliset, are described at length further on. I also

secured by purchase several specimens from Atanekerdluk, and a few fossil

shells from Paitorfik in the district of Umenak *.

  We were ready to start by the middle of August, but the natives on whom

we had relied for a crew preferred to go south, to a dance at Claushavn ; and

it was owing to the kindness of the trader at Jakobshavn, who gave us a

passage in a blubber-boat returning to Eitenbenk, that we were at length

Weenabled to start on our journey.  got to Eitenbenk at 1.30 a.m. on the

20th of August, and in spite of the inconvenient hour at which we arrived,

were received with the greatest warmth and hospitality by Mr. Anderson.

On the evening of the same day we again started ; this time with a strong
force, by the advice of Mr. Anderson, the trader. There were now with me

two boats, one hired at Eitenbenk, eleven native men and women, and Messrs.

Brown and Tegner (naturalist and interpreter). I tried hard to engage the

natives to go as far as Umenak, but failed to get them to promise to go

further than Atanekerdluk.

  We started at 10.30 p.m., and our coiu'se soon took us into the midst of

the Tossukatek ice-stream, a great assemblage of icebergs largo and small,

which were given off from a glacier whose summit we could jiist see on the
horizon. This ice-stream was remarkable for the enormoiis number of ice-

bergs it contained, and was also notable for the small amount of moraine

matter upon them. Eeally large blocks of rock we did not see, and those of

a yard in diameter were rare ; but there was abundance of small stones, of
grit, and of sand upon the bergs. There is no doubt that beneath the course

of the Tossukatek ice-stream, as below all others t, there are conglomerate

strata in course of formation, which cannot now be seen, but which may

possibly be presented to the view of future travellers.

Shortly after passing through this ice-stream we arrived at the small

settlement of Sakkak J. This place stands by the water's edge at the entrance
Aof a great valley running into the heart of the Noursoak peninsula.
                                                                                   con-

siderable river that flows down this valley falls into the sea a little to the

north of the settlement, and appears to form the boundary line of the granite

districts which we were just quitting, and the trap formation upon which we

were just entei'ing.

f On the voyage up Davis Straits we wero becalmed off Eifkol, a noted landmark, and

ancliored on some banks in eigliteen fathoms. These banks have certainly been greatly in-

creased, if not originated, by the deposition of matter from the icebergs of tlie Jakobshavn

ice-stream. At the time vre were anchored a large number of small bergs were aground

Weupon them, breaking up and reTolving all around.  took the opportiuiity to put down

the dredge, and although we only worked irom the ship side, and consequently over a very

limited amount of bottom, we brought up in two or three hauls fragments of granite,

gneiss (some vnth garnets), syenite, quartz, hornblende, greenstone, and mica-slate. The

four years. He says that the glaciers which can be seen from his honse,

both on the Noursoak peninsula and upon Disco Island, are steadily increas-
ing ; so much so that their progress can bo noted every year. This state-
ment coincides with the observation of >Sir C. Gicscckc nearly sixty years ago.
The latter says*, speaking of the route to Umenak, "formerly they drove

generally over Gamle Ritcubenkt, but for several years the road has become

impassable in consequence of the 'iceblink' by which the whole continent

there is covered. The same will take place with the new road at present in
use." The glaciers to the south were, however, as far as I observed them,

decidedly shrinking.

At Sakkak we were joined by a native guide for Atanekerdluk, named

WeGudemann, and also by two others who volunteered their services.  con-

tinued our journey after a brief halt, and arrived at our destination shortly

after 1 a.m. on August the 22nd.

The name Atanekerdluk is applied by the natives to a basaltic peninsula,

about half a mile in length, connected with the mainland by a sandy neck,

Awhich is apparently covered by the sea at spring-tides.  bay with a sandy

beach stretches about two miles to the south, and at its further extremity

there is another promontory, of columnar basalt, named Imnarsoit. Between

these two promontories, and indeed along the whole of the shore from the
above-mentioned valley at Sakkak to the most northern point of the Noursoak

peninsula, mountains rise from the water's edge and attain in some places a
height of 5000 to 6000 feet. Behind the peninsula of Atanekerdluk they

do not, however, attain a height greater than 3600 or 3800 feet. They are
cut up by numerous small valleys and ravines.

The position of Atanekerdluk is indicated at a great distance by means of

three mountain-peaks of symmetrical form. The fossil bed is one-third way

up the most northern of these, and between it and the central one. Under
the guidance of Gudemann we started for it at midday on the 22nd. The

sides of the hill on which it is situate (an outlying buttress of the -mountain

already mentioned) were of considerable steepness, and channelled in many

places by small streams. It was mainly composed of sand and of shales,

and was strewn with disintegrated fragments of hardened clays, sandstones,

and basalt. The most prominent features were the dykes of trap which

appeared in numerous places J, sometimes as regular in form as built walls,
and in others picturesque as Rhine castles. Five, if not six, of these dykea

appeared at different places in the section of the coast between the headlands

of Atanekerdluk and Imnarsoit.

It has been already mentioned that this locality had been freqiiently

visited § before 1867 for the sake of its fossil deposit. This was evident by
numerous fragments that we found in the conrse of our ascent, which had

been dropped by others in descending, and it seemed at first as if the deposit

was very extensive. \Ve found it in fact to be confined M'ithin narrow

limits. It did not appear to extend a greater length than 400 feet, with a

maximum depth of 150 feet. In most places the portion exposed was

nothing more than a seam a few feet in depth. It was on a shelf of the hiU.

deposit, that is to say the face of the hill on which it was found, fronted the

   I took from England, besides hammers, picks, and shovels, all the neces-

saries for blasting; but these latter were unnecessary. The seam was for

--the most part enclosed by sand, and specimens were obtained with ease. The

division of labour was as follows : The natives (fourteen) collected, Mr.
Tegner interpreted, and I selected. I directed Mr. Brown to collect speci-

--mens of the different strata in order that sections might be prepared*. The

specimens are before me, and comprise : basalt ; sandstone containing nodules
of basalt rather smaller than an ordinary walnut ; indurated black mud, pro-
bably derived from decomposed basaltic rock ; limestone ; calcareous mud,

containing lime and alumina ; calcareous mud with layers of vegetable matter ;

sandstones of different degrees of fineness ; sandstone containing a large

amount of alumina ; coarse sandstone, about equivalent to the millstone grit
of Derbyshire and Yorkshire ; coarse conglomerate sandstone, with fragments
of silica about the size of common horse-beans ; calcareous sandstones of
different degrees of fineness (effervescing readily when hydrochloric acid is
applied) ; fine-gTaincd calcareous sandstone, in which the lime effervesces
when hydrochloric acid is appKed, and containing mica distributed in patches

with silica ; calcareous sandstone, with layers of vegetable matter ; ferrugi-

nous conglomerate (grains of quartz, cemented togetlier by oxide of iron)

hard clay of black colour ; fine hardened mud containing vegetable impres-

sions ;  streaks of  clay, with  layers                                                                                                of  coal one-sixteenth of an  inch  thick

bitiyniuous shale ; and lignite f. After a hard day's work we returned to our

camp, in a ruined native house by the shore. It froze sharply during the

night.

On the 23rd we resumed work, and by the close of the day had made a

mylarge collection of good specimens. It was                                                                                                            endeavour to select, as far as

possible, perfect specimens of individual species, rather than fine slabs con-

taining numerous species. Unfortunately a large number of the finest

specimens were irremediably smashed in transit down the hill ; this was

due much more to the brittleness of the specimens and the steepness of the

descent than to carelessness. The natives indeed worked admirably.

AOn the 24th we finished our work at this localitj'.                                                                                                    trench had been

The impressions of leaves were found for the most part in stratum No. 1,

or ripon the surface; they were also obtained from Nos. 2, 3, 4, but I

believe not lower. Those found in the uppermost and upon the surface were

ordinarily in hard clay, red in colour, due to oxide of iron. These did not

suffer much by transportation                                                                                                          but the surface  had apparently undergone  a

The impressions in the softer and more brittle shales were obtained some

depth below the surface ; these yielded the best specimens, but they suffered
greatly in transit. Those found at the greatest depth were almost invariably

in lumps of hard clay that fractured irregularly ; these diifered from the
others in being of an iron-grey colour. They have reddened since they have

been exposed to the atmosphere. The trench was dug about midway be-
tween the extremes of the deposit, and examination at other points showed
a similar arrangement. The hill at this part was mainly composed of sand,

enclosing numerous thin seams of brittle indurated clay, red in colour, con-

taining a good deal of iron and of moderately fine-grained sandstones.

  We were unable to find the " perfect stem, standing four feet out of the

side of the hill," spoken of by Capt. Inglefield *, and it was unknown to the

natives. It was said to have stood on the edge of a precipice, in the ravine

on the south of the hill, and it has probably been buried in a fall that

appears to have taken place not very long ago. In the sides of this ravine,
both above and below the leaf-deposit, numerous beds of lignite are exposed,

at least one being of considerable thickness. I brought home from this bed
a block 1 foot 9 inches in thickness, a portion of which has been analyzed in

the laboratory of Mr. T. W. Keates of Chatham Place, with the following

result :

The lignite contains a trace of bitumen ; the coke is non-caking, and of little

use."

In this lignite we found small pieces of amber, the largest being about the

Wesize of a common pea.       also found amber, but in stUl smaller fi-agments,

in the leaf-deposit itself. It was nowhere abundant.

The scantiness of the living vegetation at Atanekerdluk offered a marked

contrast to the luxuriance displayed in the leaf-deposit. Although this was

the sumiy side of the Waigat Strait and the hills were completely free

from snow, vegetation was as meagre as upon Disco Island itself. The

drifting of the sand accounts for this doubtless to some extent. The largest

dead wood measured less than an inch and a half in diameter, and the largest

growing wood less than an inch.

The most remarkable natural object at Atanekerdluk is a trap pinnacle f.

The surrounding soil has been removed, leaving this portion of a former dyke

standing perfectly isolated. Its height is about eighty feet.

On the evening of August the 24th we rowed across the Waigat to a little

settlement on Disco Island, named Unartuvarsok, immediately opposite to

Atanekerdluk. At this part the Waigat is nearly twelve miles across, and

its passage took us more than four hours.

6 REPORT 1869.

   Unartuvarsok is now the only inhabited place on the Mhole of the "Waigat

side of Disco Island, and the sole inducement to visit it lay in the expecta-

tion that Ave should be able to find a native who knew the localities of Uja-
rasuksumitok and Kudlisct. In this we were not disappointed; the native

catechist (teacher) oifered to act as guide, and moreover invited us to pass
the night in his house. AYo did so, and found the atmosphere most filthy.

   Early on the following morning we again started, passing at a short

distance from the settlement some remarkable peaks that stood in advance
of the great basaltic clifts which arc the chief features of Disco Island.
These cliffs are everywhere crowned by glaciers, which occasionally, but
rarely on the Waigat side of the island, pour over and advance towards
the shore. Near the settlement of Unartuvarsok there are two or three

points, at least, at which this glacier-plateau could be reached without much

difiiculty *.

   Coal-seams are exposed at a number of points both along the Waigat and
on the coast between Flakkerhuk and Godhavn. Dr. Eink mentions f five
places at which it is found along those shores ; there are at least three others,

--- one spoken of by Giesecke ; another near to Issungoak IS'ess, from which I

obtained amber through the natives ; and a third nearer to Godhavn. At

--the time of our visit fossil wood had been found: 1st, at Iglutsiak, near

Godhavn ; 2nd, at Signifik, between the last-named place and Flakkerhuk
3rd, at Ujarasusuk (Ujarasuksumitok) ; and 4th, at Kulfelden (Kudliset).

Specimens from these places are in the University Museum at Copenhagen,
and on my return I obtained, through the courtesy of Professor Johnstrup,

duplicate specimens from the first two named. Until the time of our visit
leaves had not, however, been found, with the exception of a few specimens

by Dr. LyaU. Amber had, however, been found at several places ; and from

this fact, and from the statement by Giesecke that he had himself observed
impressions of leaves (apparently Anr/elica A)xhan(/elica), there was little
doubt but that a more careful search would yield results. It was most im-

portant to find the place spoken of by Giesecke as liitenbenk's Kulbrund.
There was difficulty in doing so : the natives differed among themselves ; but

we now know that this name is applied equally to aU the places along the
Waigat coast of Disco from which coal lias been taken for Piitenbenk, At

the present time coal for that colony is only taken from one place on Disco,

namely, Ujarasuksumitok ; but it has been taken from several others, and

hence we were much puzzled to determine the precise point to which Giesecke

referred.

   On arrival at Ujarasuksumitok it was found that the coal was exposed in

the cliff by the shore, at a height of about fifty feet above the sea. It had
been worked a length of fifty feet to a depth of four and a half: one could
not say what was the entire depth of the seam, as the lower part was covered

up by debris. jUI the natives were put to work, but for some hours we failed
to find anything more than wood (up to five inches diameter), charred stems,

* The coast -line of the ^yaigat strait is laid down very inexactly in existing maps. Tlio

chart of Dr. Eink, which is probably the best, makes the Disco coast very nearly a straight

for a considerable distance from the shore they were extremely shallow. At a distance of

a half English mile, or even more, there were places with a depth of only eight or nine

feet. The whole of the Waigat, indeed, appeared to be shallow. Small icebergs were

aground in numerous places in the very centre of it.

doubtful impressions, and a few grains of amber. I then went along the

coast towards the north, and was at length rewarded by finding a fair speci-

men, containing leaves, in the bed of a small stream. It was in hardened,

warm-coloured clay, similar to that obtained at Atanekerdluk. I followed

the stream to its source, a height of about 1000 feet, without finding

anything more. Then returning, I went to the south, and in another and

larger torrent-bed foimd several others. The natives, now put on the right

track, soon brought in a fair collection. Gudemanu was the fortunate dis-

coverer of the Magnolia cone, to which Prof. Heer refers, and he was greatly

surprised at the reward it produced him.

AU the specimens collected at this place were obtained from these two

torrent-beds : Mr. Erown, who followed the fossUs up to their soiurce, reported
that they came from a thin seam difficult to get at. As it was becoming a
question whether the boats would carry aU the specimens we had ah'cady

collected, I decided to push onwards the same night to Kudhset, which, from

reports received, seemed a more promising place for investigation.

  We arrived there about midnight, and camped very smartly. The weather

had already become sufliciently cold to freeze the salt water in the bays at

night, and during the whole day fresh water remained frozen in the little

pools on the land. The whole of this part of Disco Island was very dismal.

Its aspect allows the sun to shine upon it for but a small portion of the day*,

Aand all animal life seemed to shun it.   few ptarmigan were the only

lining creatures we saw on the land during the days we passed on these

shores. There was little wonder that the natives Averc akeady wishing to

return. They wore ill-protected from the weather ; for, from reasons which

need not be mentioned, it was impossible to allow them to enter the tents,

and they had only such shelter as they could obtain by piling up turf and

stones, and covering themselves with a few small blankets and spare skins

which we had brought with us.

At this place (Kudliset) coal (lignite) was exposed in a cHft' on the south

side of the bed of a small stream in two seams, 4 feet apart, for a length of about

30 feet, difficult to get at. They were 105 feet (by aneroid) above the sea,
and distant from it about 300 yards. The lowest seam, 2 feet thick, was
resting on a bed of indurated clay, and between the seams was a coarse and
very loose, crumbly sandstone. The uppermost seam, one foot thick, was
capped by a finer and harder sandstone which I could not measure. The

whole, above and below, was enclosed by sand.

   In the torrent-bed we quickly found some considerable masses of fossilized
wood, and I followed the stream upwards in hopes of finding leaves. At a

height of about 800 feet I obtained agates in basalt, and following the stream

to its source (about 1000 feet above the sea), came nearly to the foot of the

great basaltic chifs. The specimens collected here include hardened clays

which have taken form in cavities in the basalt. Returning to my party I

found that they had in the meantime obtained some indifferent and fair

specimens from the torrent-bed, and from the sandstone above the coal.

We afterwards added to their number, but the coarseness of the stone pre-
Wevented any very good specimens from being obtained.
                                                       also secured some

during the summer time, but that at a depth of 12 feet it remained frozen throughout the

to thaw, before continuing to work it.
8 REPORT 1869.

laceous oxide of iron, having usually in the centre kernels of the same, were

abundant in the stream and in the soil at its sides.

After a half-day's work we had apparently exhausted this locality. The

specimens obtained were again chiefly taken from the torrent-bed. It was

a matter of difficulty, if not of danger, to get any from the sandstone above

the coal; and as the natives were murmui-ing frequently at being taken

away further than they had agreed, I sent Mr. Erown to the south with one

boat, to examine the coast, and then proceed to Eitenbenk, a'/a Atanekerdluk,

while I went with the other boat as far north along the Disco shore as the

Anatives would go.        little further along the coast I found some doubtful

impressions of leaves in a great wilderness of stones brought down by a

glacier-torrent, and about three miles still further north came to the magni-

ficent gorge in the sandstone chfi's by the shore, to which I have vainly

endeavoured to do justice in the view exhibited*. One mile after this the

cliffs by the shore came to an end, and the coast apparently continued quite

flat until opposite Hare Island. The natives agreed that no coal was visible

along the whole of this shore, and we crossed to Mannik, on the opposite

side of the "Waigat. Here there was a small thin seam of coal, exposed in a
clifi' not far from the shore ; but I obtained nothing from it, and we continued
our course to Atanekerdluk, arriving shortly after midnight; here we passed

the night of the 27th August. The next day was occupied in loading the

boat with the specimens we had left there, in sketching, and in completing

the examination of the locality. At 4 p.m. we started for Sakkak, and left

it at 8.30, arriving at Eitenbcnk on the morning of the 29th August. Mr.

Brown had arrived about twelve hours before, but, hke ourselves, had failed

to make any fresh discoveries.

At Ritenbenk we remained three days, with foul weather. During this

time the collections, including many hundred specimens, amounting to con-

Wesiderably more than half a ton in weight, were repacked.  were then

favoured, by the kindness of Mr. Anderson, with a passage in a blubber-boat

to Godhavn, at which place we arrived on September the 4th, after a most
disagreeable voyage. On the 10th we sailed on board the brig ' Hoalfisken,'

and arrived at Copenhagen on October the 22nd.

In conclusion it is right to observe that these collections could not have

been made excepting by means of the facilities afforded by the Danish

Weauthorities.  may feel a natural satisfaction that so many as eighty

species should have been discovered by the labours of Professor Heer ; but

it shoidd be remembered that they are primarily due to the invaluable in-
formation given by Herr C. S. M. Olrik, the Director of the Greenland Trade.
Scarcely less are our thanks due to Herr K. Smith, the present Inspector of
North Greenland, and to Herr Anderson, of Kitenbenk; both of these
gentlemen gave much assistance, at considerable personal trouble, which was

of the greatest service.

Preliminary Report on the Fossil Plants collected by Mr. Whymper in North
                   Greenland, in 1867. By Prof. Oswald Heek.

   The fossil plants which have been sent to me by Mr. Whymper have come

partly from Disco Island and partly from Atanekerdlidi.

   * At this part some boulders of granite, probably transported by sea-ioe, were lying on

the shore.

ON THE PLANT-BEDS OF NORTH GREENLAND.  9

   The specimens from Disco occur in a coarse-grained sandstone which is at
times yellowish, and at times reddish-grey. They were collected at two

localities on the eastern side of the island, on the shore of the Waigat, in

lat. 70°, or thereabouts. One of these is named Kiidlisot (Kudliset), the

other is Ujararsusuk (Ujarasuksumitok), and lies some miles to the south of

Kudlisot. This place is also called Eitenbenk's coal-mine, because of a

considerable seam of brown coal which occurs in the sandstone, and is some-

times wrought by the colonists of Eitenbenk.

   The collection contains thirteen species from these two localities, viz. eleven
from Kudlisot, and six from Ujararsusiik ; four species are common to both.

Two of these may be described as the commonest trees of the district. One

is a conifer (Sequoia Couttsice), the other a plane. The collection contains

splendid specimens of the Sequoia; and with one t^ig from Ujararsusuk we
find the scales of the cone in good preservation, while among the delicate

twigs from Kudlisot there is an entire cone. The twigs and cones are
precisely similar to those which are so common at Bovey Tracey in Devon-
shire, and which have also been found in the Hempstead beds in the Isle of
Wight. This remarkable tree, which I have described as Sequoia Couttsice,

and which is closely allied to Sequoia f/ir/antea WeUingtonia gir/antea, Liudl.),
                                                                                                                                     (

extends accordingly from the south of England to North Greenland, and has

ripened its fruit in the latter region. Not less remarkable is the plane, of
which the collection contains very fine leaves ; it resembles the American
plane, from which it is not easily distinguishable.

   Among the other plants from this localitj^ we may name a fern (Asj)i-

dium Meyeri), which is covered with fruit, a reed, the amber-tree of
Europe {Liquidamhar Europaum, Braun), a Christ-thorn (Paliurus Colomhi),
and a Dryandra (D. acutiloha), which was only known to occur in the Wetterau
and at Bilin, in Bohemia.

   The most remarkable discovery, without doubt, is that of two cones of

Maynolia. In my ' Elora Arctica ' I have already identified the leaves of a

Magnolia (M. Inglejieldi), and have shown that in respect of their size and

leathery texture they approach those of M. grandijiora, L. Now we find

these cones coming to light and confirming the identification of the leaves.
In addition to a cone of the same size as that of M. grandijiora, there is a
spray with a large bud, very similar to those of Magnolia. At Kudlisot
several fragments of leaves were collected.

    Of the thirteen species from Disco three are entirely new, and besides
seven had not previously been recognized as Greenland species.

    Atanekerdluk lies on the opposite side of the Waigat, on the peninsula of
Noursoak, and in the same latitude as Kudlisot. This locality has already
afforded the abundant collections which have been brought to Dublin and

London, and to Copenhagen and Stockholm, and which are described in my

' Flora EossUis Arctica.' At this place Mr. Whymper has collected a great

number of plants, in fact the greater portion of his collection. The majority
of the species contained in the slabs were already known, as might have been
expected. The Poplars and Sequoias (S. Langsdorffi, Brgn.) are very abun-
dant, and the twigs and leaves at times cover the entire surface of the stone.

We can recognize the male and female flowers in addition to the cones. The

M'Clintockias, which are in themselves so remarkable, and the leaves of
oaks and hazelnuts are not rare, and are sometimes very well preserved.

   I have hitherto recognized sixty species ; but as many of the slabs have
not yet been worked out, it is probable that this number wiU be increased.
One-fourth of these, i. e. fifteen species, are new, or at least new to Green-

land, and of these the following deserve special notice ;
--10 KEroRT 1869.

A1. Sassafras (Sassafras Ferretianum), closely allied to the North-American

species. This species I had obtained from Mcnat in Prance, and it also

occurs at Sonegaglia.

2. The fruit of a Ni/ssa, like a species from Bovej and from Salzhausen.

A3. Ycrjr perfect leaf of a Snowball (Viburnum Whyniperi, Hr.).

4. Leatherj'^ leaves of a plant which probably belongs to the AraUas (Aralia

Broivniana, Hr.).

  A5. new species of Cornns and a new Crattecius.

   Important though the discovery of these new species is as extending our

knowledge of the Miocene Flora, it is not more so than the additional

information as to known Arctic forms Avhich has been afforded by tliis expe-

dition, as tending to correct, or rather to confirm their identifications.

   Among these wo should name a very beautiful Fern (Hcmitellites ToreJlii),

which  differs widely from all  those of  the  temperate  zone                        the leaf-part of
                                                                                   ;

a Salisburia, wliieh in its form approaches very closely to the Japanese

species ; a perfect leaf of Quercus LjieUii, Hr. ; the loaf of a Vine ( Vitis
arctiea, Hr.) ; several fragments of leaves of nut-trees, and of Magnolia

Inrflefieldi ; and the fruit of Menijantlies, which species I have already

identified by means of the leaves.

On the whole the collection contains sixty-seven species, of which twenty-

two are new to Greenland, and are accordingly additions to our knowledge

of the Ibssil flora of the Arctic Zone.

To these maj' be added three specimens of the fauna, two insects and a

bivalve. One of the insects exhibits elytra in very good preservation, and

belongs to the Colcoptera, the other to the Heraiptera. The bivalve is a

freshwater species (Oydas), and confirms the view that the deposit of Ata-

nekerdluk, which contains so many plants, is a freshwater formation.

   application which it may be desirable to make to Her Majesty's

    Government on these subjects. Prepared for the Committee by C.

   W. Merrifield, F.R.S.

The subject referred to us is a very large one, and having regard both to

the space which a complete report on such a matter would require and to

the time at our disposal for making it, we have thought it best to lay before
the present Meeting a First lleport, in which we confine ourselves to the

resistance luhich ships offer to propulsion, and to their behaviour in 7'espect of
rolling. These are, in their several directions, the preliminary subjects neces-
sary to the inquiry committed to us ; and they are also the parts of naval
science on which exact experiment appears to be most urgently needed, both
for the direct knowledge of these branches, and also as a foundation for ex-
periments on propulsion and the other applications which depend upon them.
Knowledge of the work to be done should precede the selection of the tool
with which it is to be performed.

                                                      Total Resistance.

 --The question of resistance may be treated in two ways, either in gross,

as regarding the power required to drive a vessel of certain form and dimen-
sions at a specified rate ; or in detail, as regarding the exact way in which
the vessel and the propeller act and react upon the water which they disturb.
Hitherto there has been but little connexion established between the pheno-
mena of detail and the general result, the former not being understood with
any reasonable degree of certainty, and the latter also being far from settled
with precision.

   The variable elements which go to make resistance what it is are chiefly
velocity, form, condition of surface, and absolute dimension. The effect of
form is as varied as the number of forms which can be given to a floating
body. As regards dimension, assuming the forms te be geometrically the

same, it has been found that vessels of different absolute size do not corre-
spond in the degree of resistance which they encounter, whether in smooth
water or in waves. It will also be seen that the absolute length of a ship,
considered irrespectively of breadth or depth, has a direct influence on the

resistance.

   As regards velocity, it is usual to assume, in books on hydrodynamics, that
the resistance of water varies as the square of the speed. For the purposes
of naval architecture, this can only be taken to be roughly true under certain
limiting conditions, beyond which the law of the squares deviates widely
from the observed facts. It appears to be probable that this increase, as the
square of the speed, is rather a minimum than a general rule of increase,
and that such a minimum is only attained by ships of good form, and of a
length which is a certain function of the speed. The vague words good form

are used designedly, it being still i;ncertain what the best form may be, and
what extent of deviation from it takes the vessel out of its operation-. When

the vessel is shorter than a certain limit of length depending on the velocity,
the resistance seems to increase more rapidly than the square, and the power
needed to drive the ship Consequently increases faster than the cube of the

velocity.

   It may save confusion to remark that the measure of resistance is referred

to a unit of distance, yvhilc j^oiver is referred to a unit of time. For any law
of resistance, therefore, the power varies as the product of the resistance and

speed, and where the velocity varies we have simplj- to use the corresponding

integral formula.

   As already remarked, the leading formuhe of the resistance of water are

                      RaV^HPaEVaV',

the latter being the strictly necessary consequence of the former. There is

but little disagreement among- writers up to this point. But the moment we

attempt either to assign values to the constants of the equations which they
imply, or to introduce the corrections depending on the complex phenomena,

which always, more or less, mask the mere question of fluid resistance, we

find vei-y little agreement.

   The chief elements of the resistance of water to a body moving through it

are:

    (1 ) The direct head-resistance due to the work of thrusting the water to
the right and left, with or without vertical motion, in order to make way
for the body to pass.
----

12 REPORT 1869.

    (2) The sl-in-resistance, or friction, of the water on the surface of the mo-
ving body, combined -with the effect of surface eddies and other minute phe-

nomena.
    (3) The bach pressure, due to the diminished pressure in rear of the moving

body and in wake of any comers or unfairness of surface which may cause

 eddies.

    (4) In addition to those, there are the phenomena of capillarity and of the
viscosity of water. These are of importance as regards minute bodies,
including even small models ; but for large ships they are sufficiently ac-
counted for in the arbitrary constant of skin-resistance. This fourth head

may therefore be neglected, except when we wish to pass from ships to

models.

    For extreme shapes it does not appear that the three leading elements of
resistance can be grouped under one term ; but there is reason to believe
that, for vessels of a certain form, they all involve, with a respectable degree
of approximation, the square of the velocity, and also that the forms for
which this is true are among those which offer, cceteris 2^«>'ibus, the least re-
sistance. Under these circumstances, the formulte depenchng on skin-resis-

tance may be made to include the other two by merely altering the constants.

We conjecture that, when authors state that certain elements of resistance

may practically be neglected, they usually mean that they can be accounted

for in assigning the values to the arbitrary constants, which, in any case,

must be determined from experiment. We have named vessels of a certain

form ; this form must be regarded as still unknown, except with reference
to some limitations of a negative character, even these being rather indefinite.
They include a fine entrance, and a fine run, and an absolute length of not
less than the length of the trochoidal wave moving with the same velocity.
The actual determination of the form of least resistance is not only unsolved,
but the data of the problem are yet unknown.

    The first formulae that occur are the well-known coeflBcients of steam-ship

performance

                                    (Speed)' X (displacement)*

               ,

(Speed)' X area of midship section

      Indicated horse-power

As affording a rough measure of comparison, the tabulation of these for-

mulae for different ships is extremely convenient. But they are of very little
assistance in setthng a theory. Even for the same vessel, tried under appa-

rently similar conditions, these coefficients do not appear to be constant

quantities. Moreover, the varying efficiency of the steam-engine and of the
propeller, considered as machines for the transmission of poAver, are inse-

parably grouped with the work of overcoming resistance. When the con-

sumption of coal is substituted for the I.H.P., the efiiciency of the furnace

and boiler also comes in. Some of these remarks apply to Mr. Hawksley's

approximate formula,

      \wetted surface               /

but this was only intended for rough purposes.

  We may here mention a formula given by Mr, Greene, in a paper read at

the Franklin Institute of New York, and reprinted in the ' Mechanics' Maga-

zine ' for 8th July, 1864. It proceeds on the assumption that the power

   Most modern formula) for resistance take account of the form of the vessel,
in such a manner as to require the use of the drawings of the exterior sur-
face of the ship. The Swede, Chapman, in his well-known treatise on ship-

building, assumes that the surface of the vessel may be divided into small

portions, the resistance of each of which will be proportional to the projection
of its area, to the sine squared of the inclination, and to the square of the
velocitj^ ; with a certain small correction on account of the currents which

are set up bj' the ship's own motion, and which modify the pressures. But
he himself saw reason from subsequent experiments to doubt whether the
law of the sine squared, or even that of the velocity squared, was applicable

to the forms which he used.
    Euler* and most of the older writers use the sine squared of the incli-

nation as the factor representing the effect of obliquity ; and this theory has
been revived by Mr. Hawksley in a discussion at the Institution of Civil En-

gineers, reported in their ' Proceedings ' for 1856, vol. xvi. p. 356. But we
think that there is now ample experimental ground for believing that, whether

or not this law be true with respect to an infinitesimal portion of a plane re-
ceiving the impact of a thin jet of water, it is not true either of plane sur-
faces of considerable extent, or, as a differential formula, of curved surfaces.
It evidently fails to take account of the effect of the stream which is set up along
the surface in deflecting the impact of water on the part of the surface further
back from the entrance. The assumption that this has no effect is not one
which can be admitted without proof ; and the experimental evidence tends
the other way. Chapman's later experiments, the experiments of the French
Academy, and those of Col. Beaufoyf are all against the hypothesis of the
sine squared of the inclination. The supposition that the sine squared of the

inclination represents the effect of the obliquity of the afterbody is still

more open to doubt than when it is applied to the forebody.
    As a contribution to the history of the subject, the following translation

from a tract of M. Dupuy de Lome will be interesting :
    " Romme, in his Memoir for the Academy of Sciences, in 1784, while

giving an account of the experiments made by him at Rochefort on models
of ships, one of which represented a 74, and, again, in his work on the ' Art
de la Marine,' had very succinctly laid down that this resistance was inde-
pendent of form. ' Provided,' he went on to say, ' the water-lines have a
regular, fair curvature, as is the case in modern vessels, the greater or less
fullness of the bow or stern neither increases nor diminishes the resistance

of the water to their progress.'

    " In direct contradiction to this too summary rule, which has long ob-

structed the progress of naval architecture, my experience leads to five prin-

ciples, which I state as follows :

   " 1°. Among vessels of similar geometrical form, of different size, but all

having their immersed surface exceedingly smooth, and driven at the same

speed, the jiressure needed to attain this speed increases more slowly than

the sui'face of the greatest transverse section. It is near the truth to say

that, for similar forms, the resistance per square metre of midship section, at

the same speed, decreases as the vessel increases, in the ratio of the square

roots of the radii of curvature of its lines, these radii being themselves pro-

portional to the linear dimensions of the ships ; it is therefore wrong to
compare the resistance of different ships by means of experiments made on

models to reduced scales*.
   " 2°. If the same vessel be driven at different speeds, the force needed to

obtain these velocities increases less rapidly than the square of the speed,

while that is small. The force increases as the square for ordinary rates of

3 to 5 metres per second, according to the condition of the surface in respect

of smoothness. Beyond that speed it increases faster than the square f.
   " 3°. The diminution of the angle of entrance, and the lengthening of the

radius of curvature of the lines wliich the water has to follow, especiallj' in

the replacement in wake of the stern bj^ the water coming up from below, are

the principal means of diminishing the resistance. This has the greater in-

fluence the greater the driving-power. For very slow motion, the influence

of form is less than that of surface friction.
   " 4". The sharpness of the bow, both above and below the water-line,

which has in calm water the effect just mentioned, has more marked advan-

tages in a heavy sea-way.
   " 5°. The smoothness of the wetted surface plays a considerable part in

the resistance ; and this part, due to friction, varies but little with the speed.
   " I add that the resistance of the hull increases markedly in narrow chan-

nels, and still moi-c where the depth of water does not much exceed the

draught of the sliip ; so that experiments ought to be made in deep water.

   " Finally, my numerous observations on the resistance of ships, in calm

weather and open sea, agree, with a close approach to exactness, with the

following formula, which I have since adopted as the measure of the resis-

tance :  W.E=KS(V^ + 0-145V')-FK'S^

    " In this formula, I call
            S, the area of midship section in square inches.

           K, a coefficient varying with the form, diminishing inversely as the
       square root of the radii of the curvature of the longitudinal sections, and

       also diminishing with the mean angle of entrance. This second reduc-
      tion amounts to about 15 per cent., as the mean angle of entrance comes

        clown from 45° to 15°. It is therefore about g per cent, for each degree
       between those limits.

   " The power needed to obtain this speed is obtained from this calculation
by mviltiplying the resistance, so calculated, by the velocity."

   The above remarks are translated from a memoir published by M. Dupuy
de Lome on the occasion of his candidature for the French Academy in
1865-66. It is reprinted in M. Flachat's ' Navigation a Vapeur Trans-

oceanienne,' vol. i. p. 206.

   It may not be out of place to mention, in explanation of M. Dupuy de
Lome's remarks about the angle of entrance, that the ai'chitects of the Im-
perial Navy avoid the use of the hollow bow. There is at most a slight

concavity at the fore -foot. Hence the angle of entrance has a meaning
which is sometimes lost in modern English practice.

   M. Bourgois, in his memoir * on the resistance of water, gives formulae
which may be grouped under the general form of

                       r=b^v^[k,+k,5+K3^],

B^ being the area of midship section, S the wet surface, and I the breadth

extreme. K^, K.,, and K^ are constants which vary with different classes of

vessels.

The dependence of the resistance of ships upon the theory of waves ap-

pears to have been first insisted upon by Mr. Scott Russell. That gentle-

man seems to have been the first to discover that there was a relation

between the length of the ship and the velocity of advantageous propulsion,

b being the half breadth of the ship at any level, and 1 the length of the
forebody, which must not be less than the length of the " solitary wave,"

for its level lines, their equation being

tions, the resistance of the ship will be expressed by

K and K^ are coeiRcients, the former of which may be roughly stated at j'^j

of that due to a flat plate drawn flatwise through the water, and the latter

depending upon the condition of the surface. For a pure wedge bow, whose

angle is e, Mr. Scott Eussell considers that the resistance varies as I s      |,

e Ij'ing between the limits of 12° and 144° ; and where the bow is compounded
of this and of the wave form, he gives, as a rough measure of the resistance,
a formula obtained by compounding this, in such proportion as may properly

represent the geometrical combination of form, with the resistance due to the
wave form.

   As far as can be judged by Mr. Scott Russell's published writings, there
appears to be some unsettled ground in his theory relatively to the shape of
the afterbody. The form of the bow is simply that of one-half the profile
of a solitary wave of translation, laid horizontallj- instead of vertically. The
form of the stern is also taken from the form of the wave, which is set up
when a hollow in the surface of water has to be filled up ; but it is nowhere
made clear whether this form ought to be given to the level sections, or to
the vertical longitudinal sections, or whether some compromise should be made
between the two ; and it seems probable that the author himself was doubt-
ful on the subject. The experiments recently made under the direction of the
Committee of the British Association appointed to make experiments on the
difference between the resistance of water to floating and immersed bodies
(Report for 18G6, p. 148) seem to indicate that that doubt is still unsettled.

    Without hazarding an opinion as to whether this form is really that of
least resistaiice, it appears certain that the cui-ves used are among those
along which fluid particles can glide smoothly, without causing supernume-
rary diverging waves in the liquid.

   The general formiila for the length of a ship given by this theory is :

--Forebody in feet= V^ in feet per second;

Afterbody=-- V- in feet per second.

   Professor Eankine states, as the result of his own observation, that it is
possible to shorten the bow to two-thirds of the length given by this formula,

without materially increasing the resistance, but that it is very disadvanta-

geous to shorten the afterbody.
    In the ' Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers,' vol. xxiii. (for

1864), p. 321, is a paper by Mr. G. II. Phipps, on the " Resistance of Bodies
passing through the Water." Mr. Phipps considers that the total resistance

may be subdivided as follows, into additive parts :

   --Head-resistance varying directly as the midship section, and inversely

            as the square of the projection ratio of the bow.

   --Stern-resistance a similar function for the stern.
   --Friction-resistance varying directly as the surface immersed.
   --Adchtional Head-resistance an empirical correction assumed to be a

            function of the draught of water.

   The sum of these resistances is then multiplied by the square of the velo-

city.

   The paper was followed by a discussion in which most of the leading
English writers on fluid resistance took part. The paper and discussion
thus constitute a very fair resume of the opinions then held on the subject in

this country.

    Mr. Phipps considers that the coefficient of friction of water on the outer
surface of a vessel is less than on the inner surface of a pipe ; and this is, to
a certain extent, in accordance with the experiments of Darcy on the friction

--of water in pipes, which led to the conclusion that the coefficient of friction

consists of two terms one constant, and the other varying inversely as the
diameter of the pipe.

   Mr. John I. Thornycroft, C.E., in a paper read before the Institution of
Naval Architects this year, and which wiU appear in their forthcoming volume
of ' Transactions,' gives the following formula, the form of which is derived
from experiments on the flow of water in pipes :

18 REPORT 1869.

Naval Architects ' for 1864 (the substance of which is repeated in a treatise
on ' Shipbuilding : Theoretical and Practical '), states that the processes
amongst the particles of water through -which resistance to the ship's motion

may be caused indirectly may bo thus enumerated :

               1. The distortion of the particles of water.
               2. The production of currents.
               3. The production of waves.
               4. The production of frictional eddies.

   The first cause he regards as having no appreciable effect on actual ships,
although possibly sensible in small models. Of the second cause (the pro-
duction of currents), Professor llankine remarks that it " never acts upon a
weU-designed ship ; for such a ship is so formed that the particles of water
glide over her surface throughout its whole length, and are left behind her
with no more motion than such as is unavoidably impressed upon them

through adhesion and stiffness ; and hence the failure of the earlier theories
of the resistance of ships, which were founded on experiments made with

flat plates, wedges, and blocks of unfair shapes."

Mr. llankine then gives a detailed account of the waves which accompany

a vessel driven at a speed greater than the limit to which she is properly

adapted, showing that they diverge from the course of the vessel at an angle

depending on the proportion in which their speed of advance is less than her

speed, and thus carry off energy, which is lost ; and he proceeds to state :

" The conclusion to be drawn from these principles is, that for each vessel

there is a certain limit of speed, below which the resistance due to the pro-

duction of waves is insensible ; and that as soon as that limit is exceeded,

that resistance begins to act, and increases at a veiy rapid rate with the ex-

cess of speed  Through the discoveries of Mr. Scott EusseU, a vessel can

be designed in which this kind of resistance shall be insensible up to a given

limit of speed; and therefore the resistance due to waves has no sensible

action on a well-formed ship." These remarks of course apply only to

waves formed by the ship, and not to sea-waves which she may have to

encounter.

   " The resistance due to frictional eddies thus remains alone to be considered.

That resistance is a combination of the direct and indirect effects of the ad-
hesion between the skin of the ship and the particles of water which glide

over it ; which adhesion, together with the stiffness of the water, occasions
the production of a Vast niimbcr of small whirls or eddies in the layer of

water immediately adjoining the ship's surface." Instead of assuming that

the frictional resistance is simply proportional to the actual immersed surface,
Mr. llankine uses what he calls the avgmented surface, which is obtained by

multiplying each infinitesimal element of the surface bj" the cube of the ratio

which the velocity of gliding of the water over that portion bears to the speed
of the ship, and summing them. Let s be the actiial surface, and q the velo-

city-ratio of gliding ; then the augmented surface is^^^ (7s ; and if, further,

V /be the speed, g gravity, iv the heaviness of -^-ater, and the coefficient of

friction, then

                                         w

Taking the cubic foot as the unit, ;j- does not differ much from unity for

ffsea-water, and the formula thus reduces to ^^ q^ ds.

   It is, of course, impossible to ealculatey^'^ ds in detail for every sliip; and

   STABILITY; PROPULSION, AND SEA-GOING QUALITIES OF SHIPS. 19

it therefore becomes necessary to find some auxiliary formula. In the
' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1863, pp 134-37, Mr. Rankine has shown that
the augmented surface of a trochoidal ribbon on a given base and of given

breadth may be found by multiplying their product by the following coefii-

cient of augmentation :

                                     l+4(sin0)H(sin0)\

in which is the angle which the inflexional tangent makes with the base.
For a ship in which the stream-lines or tracks of the particles of water are
trochoids, it would be a sufficient approximation to integrate,

   ++4length X I breadth x {1
                                                 (sin ^)^ (sin ^y}

with regard to the draught of water, considering both the angle (p and the
half-breadths as variable elements to be determined from the drawings.

AVhere the stream-lines are not trochoids, f may be taken as the angle of

greatest obliquity. But the theory has been only partially extended to three
dimensions ; and indeed if it were possible to do so, the mere introduction
of a third variable would not meet the case, unless account were taken of
the vertical displacement of the surface of the water consequent upon the

uniformity of pressure at that surface.

   The resistance determined by the calculation of the augmented surface
includes in one quantity both the direct adhesive action of the water on the
ship's skin, and the indirect action through increase of the pressure at the
bow and diminution of the pressure at the stern.

   For the coefficient of friction, Professor Eankine takes /=0-0036 for sur-

faces of clean painted iron. This is the constant part of the expression
deduced by Professor Weisbach from experiments on the flow of water in pipes.

The corresponding coefficient deduced from Darcy's experiments is 0-004.
   The augmented surface in square feet, multiplied by the cube of the speed

in knots, and divided by the I. H. P., gives Hanline's coefficient ofpropulsion*
In good clean iron vessels this ranges about 20,000 ; while in H.M. Yacht
'Victoria and Albert' (copper sheathed) it reached 21,800. Its falling
much below 20,000 is considered to indicate that there is some fault cither

in the ship or in her engines or propeller, or else that the vessel is driven
at a speed for which she is not adapted.

    Professor Eankine adds that " as for misshapen and Hi-proportioned ves-
sels, there does not exist any theory capable of giving their resistance by

previous computation."

   This, again, raises the question. What are good forms ? According to Pro-

fessor Eankine's theory, they are forms along which a particle of water can

ghde smoothly. Among these, as a particular case, Mr. Scott EusseU's wave-

lines appear to be included. But these are by no means the only ones which
satisfy the problem of smooth gliding, or of stream-lines. Another method
of constructing curves fulfilling this condition has been given by Mr. Raukine
in a series of papers published respectively in the ' Philosophical Transac-
tions ' for 1863, p. 369, and in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for October
1864, and January 1865. Elementary descriptions of this method are given
in the 'Engineer' of the 16th of October 1868, and in a treatise on ' Ship-
building : Theoretical and Practical.' Their theory has not yet been carried

very far; and when we have reference to three dimensions, it does not appear

that any specific mathematical form is to be preferred in respect of its total
resistance to a long, fine, fair ship, either drawn or modelled by eye by a

practised draughtsman or modeller.

  A possible connexion between the resistance of ships and their depths of

immersion has been pointed out by ilr. Eankine in some papers published in

the ' Proceedings of the Eoyal Society' for 1868, p. 3-1-4, in the ' Reports of

the British Association ' for 1868, in the ' Transactions of the Institution of
ISTaval Architects ' for 1868, and in the ' Engineer' of the 28th August and

30th October, 1868. He shows from theory, corroborated by his own obser-

vations, and by those of ilr. John Inglis, junior, that every ship is accompa-

Vnied by waves, whose velocity of advance is ^ k, g being gravity, and h

the mean depth of immersion, found by dividing the displacement by the area

of water-section. So long as the speed does not exceed V gk, these waves

cannot produce any additional resistance ; but when the speed exceeds
that limit, the waves are made to diverge from the ship at the angle whose

cosine is ^ , and thus to carry away energy, like the other diverging

                speed

waves previously mentioned.

The form of the midship section does not appear to exercise any influence

on the resistance to propulsion in still water, except so far as it affects the

extent of wetted surface exposed to the action of the water. If the wet

girth and the breadth at the water-line be given, the form of greatest area

will be a segment of a circle ; but this will not be the solution of the ques-

tion which usually presents itself, namely, given the breadth and the draught

required, the form for which the ratio of area to surface shall be the greatest

possible. In the particidar case in which the di-aught is half the breadth, it

is easily seen that the ratio of area to girth is the same for a semicircular as

for a rectangular section, and therefore that the solution lies between these

extreme cases. It does not appear that the general problem has yet been

solved, and perhaps, as the really practical problem relates to the ship and

Anot to the midship section, it is of secondary interest.  restricted solution

has been given by Mr. James Robert Napier in a paper read before the Glas-

gow Philosophical Society, and reprinted in the ' ilechanics' Magazine ' for

24th April, 1863, vol. ix. p. 311, and in the ' Engineer ' for 1st May, 1863,

vol. XV. p. 24.5.

   The best ratio for good propulsion of length to breadth and draught, even

when it is assumed that the length exceeds Scott Russell's limit, is not yet

known. This is not perhaps of practical importance, inasmuch as considera-

tions of economy, capacity, and handiness generally settle these proportions,

without much reference to a theoretical maximum of efficient propulsion.

But the extent to which an increase of breadth or depth, lea\'ing other things

unaltered, affects the propulsion itself can hardly be regarded as within oiir

settled knowledge.

The resistance of the air to a ship's hull is not a point to be neglected in

practice or in experiment; but it is not one which we propose to discuss

here.

The above contains an abstract of nearly all that is known concerning the

WeTOTAL RESISTANCE of a ship in smooth and deep water.     do not consider

it necessary in this Report to enter into the question of the increased resist-

ances due to shallow water, narrow channels, or a rough sea. We may sum

up the result in the broad statement that there exists no generally recognized

theory or rule for calculating the resistance of a ship. Many such rules

have been put forth ; but they do not agree in their form or in their result,
and the credit of each consequently rests, as a practical matter, on the repu-

tation of its author.

                                                           Resistance considered in Detail.

It cannot be said that our knowledge of the detailed phenomena which

accompany the motion of a floating body through the water extends far

below the surface of the liquid. Meanwhile the following things appear to

be known.

Por any vessel driven through the water by any power which does not re-

act on the fluid there must be a certain movement of the surrounding Liquid,

chiefly in the direction of the vessel's motion, which shall be suflicicnt to

absorb the work done by the propelling force ; for this is really nothing else

than the work done by the power in overcoming the resistance. Much of
this is masked by oscillatory movement. Now the setting up of an oscillation

involves an expenditure of work; but the maintenance of the oscillation,

once established, is independent of the force which caused it, to just the

same extent that it takes work to set a pendulum swinging, but once set

going, the continuance does not dejiend on the starting force. It follows

that making a wave takes up propelling work ; but that a wave once started

maintains itself, or dies out, as the case may be, independently of the pro-

peller, which it can only affect by getting in its wa3\

In a vessel of good form thrust through a fluid, we first meet with a head-

pressure wliich relieves itself by the formation of a head sAvell, which dis-

perses itself all round if time be allowed for it, either by the sharpness of

the vessel's entrance, or by a slow rate of advance. This fixes a limit of

--speed, which cannot be advantageously exceeded, dependent on the length of

entrance as well as on its form, on the length alone if the form fulfil cer-

tain conditions. If the vessel be pushed beyond the speed of dispersion of

this wave, it has to be pushed up hiU at a loss of useful work.

The frictional resistance of the surface of the ship also canies a stream of

water in the direction of the ship's motion. In fact, nearly the whole work

of friction is expended on producing this stream, which forms a part of the

ship's wake.

The necesssity of filling up the vacuum which would otherwise be left in

rear of the ship also produces a following stream, accompanied with waves.

In vessels driven at a speed beyond what is suited to their form and dimen-

sions, there are also supernumerary waves, an accoirnt of which will be found

in Professor Hankine's writings already referred to.

In vessels of unfair form there will further be violent eddies or whii'lpools,

as well as extra waves. Seeing that it takes an expenditure of work to make

these, it is clear that least resistance means least disturbance. In reality

very little is known about these eddies. Their surface-action has been

observed, and may easily be seen in dirty water, with froth esj^ecially ; but

their extent in depth, and their amplitude as the depth increases, are utterly

unknown                                                    and the other  phenomena  arc  not  sufficiently wcU understood  to

admit of the eff'ect of these being got at by exhaustion, that is to say, by

being equated to the unexjjlained residue from the effects of the other known

causes. Very little, again, is known about the direction in which the replace-

ment aft takes place. The water may of covu'se pour in eit'ner laterally or

from behind, or it may well up from underneath as a wave. More or less,

it probably does all three, and the projiortion in which it does each is among-

the things which neither experiment nor theory has as yet revealed.

22 REPORT--1869.

   Theoretically it is of no importance whether we consider the ship in mo-

tion and the water at rest, or the ship at rest and the water in motion in an
opposite direction. Practically the conditions are modified by the consider-
ation that a stream of water almost always has a sloping surface, in which
case a resolved part of gravity is one of the active forces*. Besides this,
streams useful for experiment are restricted in depth and width, and the
conditions of narrow and shallow channels introduce foreign considerations
of a very complicated character.

                                                            Propulsion.

   We do not consider it advisable in the present Report to enter into the

question of propellers, except so far as may be necessary to the choice of ex-

periments.

    All propellers, except sails, tow-ropes, and punt-poles, do their work by
 the reaction arising from their driving a stream of water in the opposite

 direction to the ship's motion, or to their stopping or reversing streams already
flowing in that direction. This is the case with oars, paddle-wheels, screws,
 and water-jets alike. But while they thi;s have one principal action in com-

mon, they are wholly different in their detailed effect upon the currents and

waves which accompany the ship, and in the way in which these currents

 and waves react upon them. Thus the oars of a row-boat send two streams
 aft, at such a distance from the sides of the boat as to interfere very little
with, and to be very little interfered with by, the waves and eddies due to
 the boat's motion. In the screw-propeller, on the other hand, a large pro-
portion of the wake current is either stopped or reversed by the action of the
 screw, which also interferes with, and is it itself reacted upon by, the wave
 of replacement. These interferences are so large in amount as not unfre-
 qiiently to mask the whole of the slip, from the reaction of which the pro-
 pulsion is obtained, giving rise to the phenomenon of apparent negative slip.
 For a theoretical account of what is supposed to take place under these cir-

cumstances, we refer to the following Papers in the ' Transactions of the In-

 stitution of Naval Architects,' and the discussions wliich took place upon
them :

                                 Former Experiments on Resistance.

    The first important experiments were those made by Bossut, Condorcet,
 and D'Alembert, by direction of Turgot. The results were published as a
 separate work in 1777, and a very full abstract of them is given by Bossut

--in his ' Hydrodynamique.' The chief results are summarized by Bossut as

 follows :

            That the resistance of the same body at different speeds, whatever be
         its shape, varies very nearly as the square of the speed.

            That the direct head-resistance of a plane surface is sensibly propor-
        tional, at the same speed, to the area of the surface.

            That the measure of the direct resistance of a plane surface is the
        weight of a fluid column which has that surface for its base, and whose
        height is that due to the velocity.

            That the resistance to oblique motion, other things being alike, does
        not diminish by a law at all approaching that of the squares of the sines
         of angles of incidence ; so that for sharp entrances, at least, the former
        theory must be completely abandoned.
    Mr. Scott Russell has remarked that between certain limits the observed
resistances of wedge-bows could be represented with a close degree of ap-
proximation by a formula of the form

                           ^-^G-^^y

Kwhere is a constant, tt stands for 180°, and e is the angle of the wedge,

which is supposed to be of not less than 12°, and not more than 144°. See
his ' Naval Architecture,' p. 168, and ' Transactions of Civil Engineers,' vol.

xxiii. p. 346.

   The next experiments of importance are those of De Chapman, published
in his ' Architectura Navalis Mercatoria.' The result of these has already
been mentioned. He performed some fresh experiments at Carlscrona, in
1795, wliich seemed to lead to somewhat different conclusions. See Inman's
translation of De Chapman, pp. 41 and 257.

   We then come to Beaufoy's experiments in the Greenland Dock from

1794-98. This enormous series of experiments can only be regarded as

establishing very few facts, among which we may mention :

            That the resistance to oblique surfaces does not vary as the sine
        squared of the angle of incidence.

           That for unfair bodies, such as he experimented upon, the resistance
        increases faster than the square of the velocity.

           That increase of length, within certain limits, has a tendency to de-

         crease resistance.

           That friction of the wetted surface enters largely into the resistance.
           That friction of the wetted surface appeared to increase in a ratio

   --somewhat less than that of the velocity squared, between v^'' and v^'^.

   He also arrives at the conclusion that bodies immersed to a depth of

6 feet experience less resistance than at the surface ; but in the case of an
iron plane towed flatwise, he found that resistance increased with the

depression.

   The whole of these experiments lose much of their value from having

been tried on small models, and on bodies which are not ship-shape.
   The ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1828 contain an account of experi-

ments performed by Mr. James "Walker in the East-India Import Dock. A

bluff-bowed boat was towed across the dock by a rope and winch, worked

by labourers, the rope being fast to a spring weighing-machine on board the
boat. The boats tried were of somewhat bluff form, and it was found that

the resistance varied only roughly as the velocity squared, increasing faster

than that at high speeds. The drawings of the boats are not given with all

the detail that could be desired, nor is the condition of their surface minutely

described ; but the experiment was in the right direction, being upon
actual boats meant for use, and of a size far exceeding the models of pre-

vious experimenters.

Some experiments by Mr. Colthurst, both on the forms of floating bodies

as affecting their resistance to motion, and on the friction of wetted sur-

faces, are given at p. 339 of vol. xxiii. of the ' Civil Engineers' Trans-

actions.'

  We also refer to the Eeport of the Committee appointed by the British

Association upon the comparative resistance of bodies wholly and partially

immersed (B. A. Reports, vol. for 1866, p. 148). The Committee decided to

print the observed facts without any deductions. It is not necessary to the

Wepurposes of this Report that we should discuss them.  have already

alluded to the difficulty which they indicate as being felt with respect to

the way in which the water of replacement flows in at the stern.

  We wHl next refer to the experiments of Captain Bourgois, which were

begun at Indret, in 1844. He first had several boats from 22 to 2-5 feet

long towed by the 'Pelican' steamer, then under his orders, and later a

small merchant schooner of a little over 60 feet long, and afterguards the

' Fabert,' a brig 98 feet long. These vessels were simply towed, and their

actual resistances measured with a traction-dynamometer. Similar experi-

ments have also been tried in France with the screw-steamer ' Sphinx,' 109

feet long ; with the screw despatch-boat ' Marceau,' 131 feet long (with its
screw upon deck), and with the 74-gun ship ' Duperre,' 180 feet long, buUt

by Sane. Probably nothing could be better than the experiments thus made,

and it is from these that M. Bourgois has derived the coefficients of the

formulte which he has given. But, unfortunately, the particulars of the

ships experimented upon are not given in great detail, nor are theii" draw-

ings published. The only particulars given are the length and breadth on

the water-line, the di'aught, and the area of midship-section immersed, but

without wet surface, or even displacement.

M. Bourgois's memoir has no date ; but it is evidently later than 1853,

since he mentions that as the date of the experiment. It also contains some

results of trials of propoilers set to work against a dynamometer with the

vessel made fast, and some trials depending upon the measurement of the
power exerted by the engine. But we do not proj^ose to discuss the trials on

steam-ship performance. Not only is this the work of another Committee,

but, inasmuch as they introduce the uncertain effects of the engine and

propeller, they fail to give any accurate account of the resistance of the

water.

In the earlier history of the subject, it was supposed that models would

most aptly represent ships at the same speed both for the ship and the
model. The exi^eriments at the East-India Import Dock in 1827 and 1828
seem to show a dissatisfaction with the results of small models ; and some time

later, M. Rcech, the Director of the Ecole d' Application du Genie Maritime

in France, pointed out that models of different sizes intended for comparison

should be made to move at velocities varying as the square roots of their

lineal dimensions. In this case the actual resistances would vary as the
           --

       STABILITY^ PROPULSION, AND SEA-GOING QUALITIES OF SHIPS. 25

cube of the lineal dimeusions. This would foUow from the theory of the
resistance of submerged bodies, on the supposition that the resistance varies
as the square of the speed. If, again, we consider Mr. Scott llussell's theory
of the length of ships (that their extreme speed should not exceed that of
an oscillating wave, bearing a definite ratio of length to that of the ship), we
arrive at the same conclusion, the length of the wave varying as the velocity

squared.

                                            Proposed Experiments.

   The experiments upon resistance which we consider most important to be
made are these :

    That a ship of considerable size and fine form should be carefully selected
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

a screw steam-sliip, with a screw capable of being lifted, with a clear deck,
offering no unnecessary resistance to the air, and with little or no rigging.

    That her form should be carefully measured in dock (her lines taken off,
as it is technically called), and sight-marks carefully laid down, so as to

ascertain whether she deforms in any way when afloat.

    That she should be towed at various speeds, from the slowest that can be
rated to the fastest that can be obtained ; and that the resistance should be
ascertained by a traction-dynamometer, self-recording.

    That the place selected for the experiments should be a deep inland water,
free from ground-swell, and such that the speed of the ship can be observed
from the land as well as from the vessel. The water also should be clear
enough to admit of being seen through to a considerable depth. The place,
if tidal at aU, should be free from cross tides or irregular currents. These

conditions, it is believed, may be found both in Norway and on the west

coast of Scotland.

   Careful observations should also be made with a view to ascertain the
direction and velocity of the local currents caused by the ship's motion.
"WTiat these should be will demand careful consideration, having regard both
to the ship and to the place selected, and to the personnel of the observers.

   The same remarks will apply to the precautions necessary to i)revent
interference by the currents thrown back by the towing-vessel or vessels,
and to eliminate other sources of error. It is of especial importance that the
ship which is being towed should be kept clear of the wake of the towing-
vessel or vessels. It might be necessary for this purpose to have two tug-
boats with hawsers meeting at an angle in the form of the letter Y.

    It is desirable that these experiments should be performed with at least
two vessels considerably differing both in size and proportions, and, for each
of them, with different condition as regards smoothness of surface.

  A third class of experiments should also be made to determine the rate of

retardation of a vessel which has been made to attain a certain velocity, and
then (the propelling-power suddenly ceasing to act upon her) is allowed to
come gradually to rest through the resistance of the water.

   It would be desirable that the same vessels (and as nearly as possible
under similar conditions of draught and trim) should be made use of for
trials of propulsion, and that in these, again, a dynamometer should be
interposed between the engine and the propeller ; and in this case also the
local currents and waves due to the joint disturbance of ship and propeller
shoidd be observed.

  We consider that experiments of the kinds which we have proposed have

now become necessary, not only to the theory of resistance, but also to the

practical calculations of the effect of steering- and propelling-aijparatus, and

incidentally to the design of these and to the apportionment of engine-

power and driving-speed.

   Such experiments are quite heyond the means of any body but the Govern-

ment of a naval power in time of peace, possessing ships which must be

exercised with their crews and staff of officers. There would of course be

extra expense attending such trials ; but this expense is in no way commensu-

rate with that of building experimental vessels, or arriving tentatively at

the suitable forms and positions for propellers.

  We therefore recommend that the Council of the British Association

should authorize a deputation to apply to the Admiralty to provide for such

a  set of  experiments  in  the  course of  the  summer of  1870                                also, that the
                                                                                             ;

Council should appoint a Committee, consisting of three Members of the

mthAssociation, to confer   officers of the Admiralty respecting the detail of

the experiments, and that the Admu'alty should be requested to give an

opportunity to the Members of that Committee of taking a share in the

observations, in order that they may be enabled to make an independent

report upon the results.

                            EOLLING OF SHIPS.

                          Stability and Free Oscillation.

   The statical stability of a ship in still water depends upon two equations

and an inequality.

   Its weight must equal that of the fluid it displaces, or it will adjust itself

by changing its water-line. This involves a first equation.

   The centre of gravity of the displaced water must be in the same vertical

line with the centre of weights, or there will be a couple which will produce

rotation ; after which the ship will take up a fresh position. This involves

a second equation.

   In case of a small angular displacement, the centre of gravity of the

displaced water (or cextre of BroTAXcv) must move out faster than the

centre of weights ; otherwise, on the slightest derangement, there will be

an upsetting couple, that is to say, the equilibrium is unstable. This in-

volves an inequality.

   The arm of the couple is the horizontal distance between the centres of

weight and buoyancy. The moment of the couple is the product of this

into the weight, or, what is the same thing, the displacement of the ship.

If the centre of buoyancj' moves out faster than the centre of weight as the

ship heels, there is a righting couple ; if not, there is an upsetting couple,

which tends to bring the ship to some new position of equilibrium.

   If we consider a vessel having a plane of sjTumetry like that in which

the masts, stern, stern-post, and keel of ordinary ships lie, and rolling trans-

versety, we gain much in geometrical simplicitj% and also in simplicity of

Welanguage.  arc enabled to deal with the mechanical questions by means

of plane geometry, and we are stOl able to extend them, when necessary, by

the ordinary rules of the composition of motion. For this purpose we have

only to consider the axis of motion as parallel to the plane of sj-mmetry and

to the water-section. The starical stability, as already remarked, is measured

by the weight, and by the horizontal distance between the centres of weight
and buoyancy. But when these coincide in horizontal position, as they do
when there is equilibrium, we are driven to some other measure in order to
avoid indeterminateness at the limit. For this purpose we avail ourselves

of the point at which the vertical line through the centre of buoyancy strikes
STABILITY^ PROPULSION, AND SEA-GOING QUALITIES OF SHIPS. 27

the plane of symmetry, or middle-line plane, as it is teclinically called. The
limiting position of this intersection, when the angular deviation is indefi-

nitely small, is called the metacentee. This metacentre is the critical
point below which, if the centre of weight be kept, there will be stable

equilibrium.

   It is shown in books on hydrostatics that if a floating body receive a small
inclination, the two water-sections intersect in a line passing through the
centre of gravity of each, and also that the Kne passing through two suc-
cessive centres of buoyancy tends to parallelism with the water-section. It
follows that the stability of a ship, statically considered, may be measured
by the statical stability of a solid, whose centre of gravity coincides with
that of the ship, but whose surface, instead of floating in water, rests on a
horizontal table. This representative surface is the surface formed by the
centres of buoyancy of the ship at different inclinations. The metacentre

of the ship is then the centre of greatest or of least curvature of this repre-

sentative surface, called the surface of buoyancy, according to whether we

 consider transverse rolling or longitudinal pitching.

   When we pass from statics to dynamics, the righting or upsetting force

simply represents an acceleration. But if the ship be considered as concen-

 trated at its centre of gravity (in disregard of the actual distribution of

weights in respect of inertia), the same geometrical considerations hold, and
the space through which the centre of gravity rises or falls as the surface of
buoyancy rolls is called the measure of dynamical stability*. It is simply
 proportional to the integral of the statical stability taken with reference to
the angle of inclination. Its product into the displacement gives the mecha-

 nical ivorl- required to heel the ship, considered as concentrated at its centre

of gravity, to a given angle. An example of its use is in the solution of the
problem of finding how much a ship would lie over to a sudden gust, strong

enough, if it came on gradually, to heel the ship to a given angle. The
 rough solution is that she woiild lie over to double the angle of the statical
 stability ; and this remark is of importance in judging of the safe limits of a
 ship's stability. This solution, it is to be observed, takes no account of the
moment of inertia of the ship about its centre of gravity, and very little

 account of external form.
    Experiment and theory both go to prove that the time in which a ship per-

forms a complete double oscillation varies but very little, whether the am-
 plitude of the oscillation be small or large. Hence every ship has its equi-
 valent pendulum. If k be the radius of gyration of the ship, /x the distance
 between the metacentre and the centre of gravity, the length of the equiva-

--lent pendulum is , the periodic timet is 2  , and the greatest angular

for the time.

ence to the disturbance or resistance of the water, is analogous to the free
rolling and sliding, on a smooth plane, of the surface which is the envelope

of its i^lanes of flotation, the centre of gravity, the upward pressure of the
fluid, and the moment of inertia being supposed to remain unaltered. But

although this statement reads simply enough, the expressions for the time

and the period, which result from it, are exceedingly complex. An inves-

tigation of it, subject to the sole restriction that the transverse section of
the surface enveloping the planes of flotation shall be circular, has been

given by Canon Moscley in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1850,
p. 626, and is reprinted in his ' Engineering and Architecture.' The result-

ing expression depends upon a hyperelliptic integral. But we are without
evidence as to how far the restriction is fulfilled by ordinary ships ; and we

do not find reason for supposing that the variation of the radius of curvature,
which is thus taken as constant, has ever been practically investigated. There
is, however, no difiiculty in extending the formula to the general case ; but
it does not appear that the integration can be effected without introducing

restrictions. At any rate the value of the integral has not yet been traced,
except for small oscillations, when it reduces to the one previously given.
There is a reduction in some particular cases*, and notably in the case of
isochronous ships. Professor Eankinef has shown that the condition of
isochronism is that the curve of buoyancy should be the second involute of a

circle described about the centre of gravity.
    It does not appear that the arithmetical consequences of the variation of

the law connecting time and angular velocity in unresisted free rolling have

ever been worked out. It would be a very laborious business ; and we shall

see by-and-by that it is not the chief problem.

we see that the periodic time of the oscillation varies directly as the radius

of gyration, and inversely as the square root of the metacentric height. This

teaches us how to regulate the periodic time of a ship, either in settling her

Wedesign, or in the distribution of her weights.                                                                                     see, for instance, that a

vessel with a rising floor and flaring sides tends to quick rolling, by having a

high metacentre ; that a cargo of railway-bars has the same efl^ect, by bring-
ing down the centre of gravity ; and that running-in the guns and sending

down the masts has a similar tendency, by decreasing the radius of gyration.

The expression for the greatest angular velocity has been sometimes inter-

preted as indicating that quick rollers roll through large angles. The fact

appears to be experimentally true, but its inference from this formula involves

reasoning in a circle. The formula only shows that for the same amplitude

the greatest angular velocity varies inversely as the time ; but this tells us

nothing about the amplitude, while the formula itself is obtained on the sup-

position that the amplitude is small.

The position of the ship's centre of gravity and the length of the radius

of gyration cannot, practically, be obtained by calculation. The centre of

gravity is generally found by shifting some known weights through known

distances, and observing the angular motion. The displacement and meta-

centre are of course known by calculation, and the problem is then the same

as if the ship were suspended from her metacentre*. The radius of gyration

is found by observing the time of a small oscillation in stiU water, and

then eliminating the effect of resistance f.

   As the metacentre depends upon the moment of inertia of the plane of

flotation, it is different for pitching from what it is for rolling, and so for

any intermediate position                                                                                               Practically, the metacentre for rolling varies
                                                                                                                  :J:.

from to 20 feet (as an extreme limit) above the water-line, while that for

pitching is from 70 to 400 or more feet high. The moment of inertia of the

ship also varies greatly with the direction of the axis about which it is

taken.

   The experiments of Messrs. Fincham and Rawson, undertaken at the sug-
gestion of Canon Moseley§, led to the conclusion that for vessels of semi-
circular section in which the disturbance of the water is the least possible,

   \ See Dupin, ' Applications de Geometric.' He shows that the metacentric heights for

rolling and pitching are, in fact, only the two principal radii of curvature of the surface

of centres of buoyancy; and hence the metacentres for intermediate positions may be found

by the help of the ellipse of curvature.

the dynamical stability found by experiment differed very little from that
derived from the rise and faU of the centre of gravity ; but in the case of
a model of txiaugular section, the stability found by experiment was in
defect. In the semicircular model the extreme inclination produced by the
sudden application of the force was, with a fair degree of approximation,
double that due to its statical effect. "With the triangular model the extreme
was less than double the statical inclination. This is nothing more than
might be expected from the disturbance of tlie water which would be set up
by the angular model, and which would, of course, take up part of the work.
But this experimental confirmation of theory is highly satisfactory ; and,
however we may now look back upon the matter, it is really upon these ex-

periments that the confirmation of oiir theories rests.
   In a resisting medium, the amplitude of the oscillations is very quickly

affected, but the periodic time undergoes very slight change. But the period

is altered to a slight extent. On this subject we refer, first, to the account

of ships.

                                    Of Easy and Uneasy SJiips.

   There is much vagueness in the use of these terms. They are generally
applied promiscuously to the practical hindrance caused by motion to the

persons engaged in working or manoeuvring the ship, to the inconvenience
felt b}'^ passengers, to the straining of a ship's structure, or the tendency to
shift her cargo, or to break away half-fastened weights, like boats or guns.

    These all appear to depend in varying proportions on the following exact

data:

    The extent or amplitude of angular motion.
    The rapidity of angular motion.
    The acceleration of linear motion.
    Eut the rapidity of linear motion and the angular acceleration (except so

far as this affects bending stress, or as it involves linear acceleration at a

distance from the instantaneous axis) do not ax^x^car to have much practical

influence.

    In still water the only motion v\'hich is sufficiently great to cause incon-
venience is that of rolling. EoUing sometimes produces as secondary pheno-

mena both pitching and dipping ; but neither of these are sufficient in extent,
in stm water, to produce inconvenience. The roIHng, however, may be con-

siderable, especially in the case of a ship going vmsteadily before the wind.
But if the water itself be oscillating, even moderately, or if there be a gusty

--wind, then a synchronism between any two of the five movements the wind,
--the waves, the rolhng, the pitching, or the dipping* or even (to a lesser ex-

tent) their concord at regular intervals may cause them to enhance the effects

one of another to such an extent as to become inconvenient, and in certain
cases dangerous. In the case of a thoroughly uneasy ship in the most un-

favourable circumstances, the axis of angular motion may assume any and
every position, and the linear acceleration may take all conceivable directions;
but although any particular point may describe the most irregular curves,

both in form and speed, relatively to the vessel's course, yet the chief source
of practical danger in open water depends upon the accumulation of motion
arising from synchronism.

    It appears to have been generally observed that vessels which have a short

period of rolling, also roll through large angles. In this way the uneasiness

of the rolling undergoes a double increase as the period diminishes. Further

and more exact experiment is required before we can say how far it is con-

nected by synchronism with wave-motion, or whether it is an independent
phenomenon. Our present theories do not show it to be a necessary conse-
quence of rolling in smooth water.

                                                         Waves.

  We do not consider it necessary to go into a formal discussion of this sub-

ject. As regards the behaviour of ships, it is quite sufficient to assume that

   * Dipping is the name given to the vertical oscillation of the ship as a whole relatiTely

to the surface of the water.

the profile of a simple wave is trochoidal, and that the particles of water

move in circles in a vertical plane, at right angles to the ridges and valleys

of the waves. The consequences of this motion are briefly as follows, on the

assumption that the depth of water is unlimited.

The diameter of the circle in which a surface-particle moves is the height

of the wave from hollow to crest. Particles which in still water would be at

Aa lower level, describe smaller circles in the same period.                       horizontal plane

(in the still water) is thus converted into a wave-surface of the same period,

but of reduced amplitude of oscillation*. The velocity of the particles (and

on this depends the impact of a wave) is simply the circumference of one of

these circles divided by the periodic time.

If we consider a column of particles which is vertical in still water, that

column oscillates in wave-water like corn-stalks in a gust of wind, and it

also oscillates vertically. But it always slopes towards the crest of the wave,

and the obliquity thus induced goes to enhance that due to the wave-slope

so that if we regard the profile of a wave, a small portion of water, rectan-

gular when still, undergoes a double deformation, the horizontal surfaces

following the wave-slope, and the vertical surfaces being deflected towards

the crest, both causes tending to increase the angular deformation instead

of to preserve rectaugularity.

   The crest of the wave being sharper than the hollow, and the quantity of
water invariable, the horizontal plane which lies halfway between valley and
crest is higher than the mean, or still- water, level ; and its elevation has
been shown to be equal to the height due to the velocity of revolution of Ihe

particles.

   Considered as trochoids, the wave-profiles are traced by a point within a
cii'cle rolling under a horizontal line. The line midway between valley and

crest is the line of centres.

   The particles of water above the line of centres are moving forwards, as
regards the direction of advance of the wave; those below that line back-
wards. The particles in the front face of the wave are rising, and those in

the rear-face falling.

of the wave-crest varies as the periodic time, and the length of the wave

varies as their product, or as the square of either.

   'No wave can be sharper thau a cycloidal wave ; for if the trochoid were

looped, the particles in the loop would be unsupported. When the wave

form tends to pass the cycloid, it must break.
   The extreme obsei'ved height of ocean-waves appears to be about 40 feet,

and the greatest observed length 600 feet ; these would have a periodic time
of 11 seconds (roughly); their crest would advance at a rate of 33 knots an
hour, and the velocity of the siirface -particles would be about 11"4 feet per
second. In short waves of the same height the particles of water move
faster, in the inverse ratio of the period ; but the mass of moving water at
the crest of the longer wave is the greater in the ratio of

where X and X' are tlie lengths, and h the height. If, therefore, the above-
mentioned wave were shortened to 200 feet, the surface-particles would be
moving at a note of 20 feet a second, while the mass of water in the crest
would be about one-sixth. From such data it is easy to infer both the de-
structive eft'ect of impact from the top of a wave, and the relative quantity
of water which a ship would take on board in shipping a sea.

   The front and rear of a trochoidal wave are exactly similar. Observation,
as well as theory, shows that this is true to an extent not commonly believed
for ordinary waves. The exceptions are, when the wind is sufficient to push
the tops of the waves at extra speed, and when the water shoals rapidly.
But oven here the relative steepness of the advancing face is exaggerated by
most observers. Until a wave is about to break, the actual difference of slope

remains very small.

   It should be borne in mind that circular orbits and trochoidal wave-
surfaces are only approximations, although near enough to the truth for
Ijurposes connected with the rolling of ships. In particular, it appears both
from theory and obsei'vatiou that there is almost always some progressive
motion combined with the orbital motion ; and also that waves begin to break
long before their crests attain a form so sharp as that of the cusped cycloid,
the two slopes at the crest of a breaking wave cutting each other at right

angles, or nearly so*.

   The ordinary wave of a rough sea is usually an aggregate of waves of
different period, and not unfrequently of different direction. For rough
purposes, it is sufficient to draw each system of waves separately and add

their corresponding ordinates, to get the resulting surface. This can hardly
be reUed i;pon in extreme cases ; and, in any case, the motion of each par-
ticle is not according to any one or more wave-systems separately, but it is a

motion compounded of what would bo due to each separately if the otlacrs
were not.

and direction of motion relatively both to wind and waves, is far too com-
plicated even for statement in an exact mathematical form.

    If a ship floating passively in the water, and without any progressive
motion, were wholly without stability, her centre of gravity, centre of buoy-
ancy, and metacentre coinciding in one point, the motion assumed by that
point would be exactly that of the centre of gravity of the mass of water
displaced by the ship--that is to say, it would revolve once_ in each wave-
period in a vertical circle of the same diameter, with the orbits of the par-
ticles of water situated in the same layer.

   This motion of the ship has received the name of passive heavhig, that
term being understood to comprehend the swaying from side to side, as well
as the rising and sinking, of which the orbital motion is compounded.

    Half the difference between the extent of heaving of the ship and the
height of the waves is the extent to which, during the passage of the waves,
her depth of immersion amidships is liable to be alternately increased above
and diminished below her deptli of immersion in smooth water. It appears
that deep immersion and large horizontal dimensions, but especially deep im-
mersion, tend to diminish the extent of the heaving motion of the ship as
compared with that of the waves, and that the effect of those causes in pro-
ducing this diminution is greatest among comparatively short waves.

   The weight of the ship, being combined with the centrifugal force due to

her heaving motion, gives a resultant reaction through her centre of gravity
inchned to the vertical in a dii-cction which, for passive heaving, is perpen-
dicular to the wave-surface traversing the ship's centre of buoyancy (a sur-

face which may be called the effective ivave-surface) ; and that direction is

the apparent direction of gravity on board the ship, as indicated by plumb-
lines, pendulums, suspended barometers and lamps, spirit-levels, and the
positions assumed by persons walking or standing on deck. The equal and
opposite resulting pressure of the water, acting through the centre of buoyancy,
is in like manner compounded of actions due to weight and centrifugal force
and it acts in a line normal to the efi^ectivc wave-surface, that is to say,
parallel to the resultant reaction of the ship. Those tAvo forces balance each
other, not when the ship's upright axis is vertical, but when it is normal to

the effective wave-surface ; and when she deviates from that position, they

form a righting couple tending to restore her to it. Thus the stability of a
ship among wa\'es, instead of tending to keep her steady, as in smooth water,
tends to keep her upright to the effective wave-sia-face ; and such is the motion
of any vessel or other floating body having great stability and small inertia,

such as a light raft. This may be called passive roUinrj, or rolling luith the

waves.

    Passive rolling is modified by the inertia of the ship, which makes her
tend to perform oscillations in the same periodic time as in still water, by
 the impulse and resistance of the particles of water against her keel and the
 sharp parts of her hull, which tend, under certain circumstances, to make

 her roll against the waves, that is, inclining towards the nearest wave-crest,

 and by other circumstances.

    The tendency to keep upright to the effective wave-surface may be distin-

guished from the tendency to keep truly upright, by calling the former stiff-
 ness and the latter steadiness. In smooth water stiffness and steadiness are
the same thing ; amongst waves they arc different, and to a certain extent

 opposed ; that is to say, the means used for obtaining one of those qualities
 are sometimes prejudicial to the other. Stiffness is favourable to the dry-

 ness of the ship, and to the power of carrying sail ; steadiness is favourable

to her strength and durability, and the safety of her lading, and, in ships of

war, to the power of working giins in rough weather.

  A ship whose course is either oblique or transverse to the wave-crests is

made by the waves to perform a series of longitudinal oscillations, which
may be c&RcA passive 2)itchi7ig and scending.

   In all the oscillatory movements which a ship performs among waves, two

--series of oscillations are combined those in which the ship keeps time with

the waves, being her i}assive or forced oscillations, and those which she per-

forms in periods depending on her own mass and figure, as in smooth water,
being what may be called her free oscillations. The tendency and ultimate

effect of the resistance of the water is to destroy the free oscillations after a

certain time, so that the forced oscillations alone are permanent.

Passive heaving, or the motion of a ship when each of her particles per-

forms an orbital motion, similar and equal to that of a certain particle of the

water in which she floats, takes place when the ship floats amongst waves

without having progressive motion.

The progression of the ship, when under way, alters the action of the

waves upon her in various ways, which depend mainly upon the apparent

period of the waves relatively to the ship (that is, the interval of time between

the arrival of two successive crests at the ship) , and upon the apparent slope

of the effective wave-surface in a direction athwart the ship, the latter

circumstance being connected mainly with forced rolling oscillations.

   When the apparent periodic time of the waves is modified by the pro-

gressive motion of the ship, the time during which the forces act which

produce the heaving motion of the ship is altered in the ratio of the appa-

rent period to the true period ; and the extent of the heaving motion is also

altered in a proportion which, for moderate deviations of the apparent from

the true period, varies nearly as the square of that ratio. This law, how-

ever, does not continue to hold for a very great increase of the apparent

period, the extent of heaving being loss than the ratio first mentioned.

Hence the heaving motion of a ship is more extensive than that of the

effective wave- surface, when the angle made by her course with the direc-

tion of advance of the waves is acute, and less extensive when that angle is

obtuse.

   Yawing, or swerving of the vessel from side to side by oscillation about an
upright axis, is, when produced by the waves, the effect of the lateral sway-

ing, which forms the horizontal component of the heaving motion, taking

place with different velocities, or in opposite directions at the bow and stern
of the vessel. The forces producing it are greatest when her course lies

diagonally with respect to the direction of advance of the waves.

   Tor reasons already stated, a very light and stiff ship tends to float like a
raft roHiug luith the waves, and assuming at every instant the same slope

with the effective wave-surface.

Let a board, having very little inertia, and no stability, be placed so as

to float upright in smooth  water                             then,  when  the water is  agitated  by
                                                           ;

waves, that board wiU accompany the motions of the originally iipright

--columns of water that is to say, it will roll against the ivaves, inchning at

every instant in a direction contrary to the slope of the effective wave-

surface.

analogous to that of a raft ; while the condition of the keel, the sharp part

of the floor, and the gripe and dead wood (or fine parts of the ends) is analo-

gous to that of the hoard floating edgewise, so that the ship is iinder the

--action of two conflicting sets of forces gravity, centrifugal force, and

pressure (constituting what id ay he called stiffness), tending to make her

roll with the waves, like the raft ; and tlie action of the water on the keel

and sharp parts of the hull, which may be called Jceel-resistaiice, tending to
make her roll against the waves, like the hoard, and hence that she will take

some kind of intermediate motion.
    It has been pointed out, however, by Mr. Proude and Professor Eankine *

that there is an essential distinction between the two sets of forces before

--mentioned, in consequence of which, though conflicting, they are not directly

o]3posod namely, that the stiftness is an active force, which tends not only
to prevent the ship from deviating from a position upright to the effective

wave-surface, but to restore her to that position after she has left it, with a force
increasing with the deviation ; while the keel-resistance is merely a passive
force, opposing the deviation of the ship from the position of the originally
vertical columns of water, with a force depending, not on that deviation, but
on the velocity of the relative motion of the ship aiul the particles of water,
and not tending to restore the ship to any defluite position. Hence those
two kinds of force cannot directly counteract, but only modify one another.

    For the mathematical investigation of the action of those forces reference
must be made to the original papers in the ' Transactions of the Institution
of Naval Architects.' The following ai-e the general conclusions :

    The permanent rolling of a ship of very great stabihty, and without any
sensible keel-resistance, is governed by the motion of the effective wave-
surface, so that she rolls vitJi the luaves or Kke a raft.

    "When the period of unresisted roUing of the vessel is to the wave-period
as a/2 : 1, the permanent rolling is wholly governed by the motion of the
originally vertical columns of water ; so that she rolls against the ivaves, like
a board of no stability floating edgewise.

    In both of the preceding cases the vessel is upright when the trough or
crest of a wave passes her, and her angle of heel is equal to the steepest slope

of the eflective wave-surface.

   When the period of unresisted roUing of the vessel is less than the above

value, her upright positions occur hefore the arrival of the troughs and crests
of the waves, and her angle of heel is greater than the steepest slope of the
effective wave-surface.

    The greatest angle of heel in permanent rolling occurs when the period of

unresisted rolling of the ship is equal to that of the waves, and it exceeds the
slope of the waves in a proportion which is " the greater the less the keel-

resistance, and becomes infinite when the keel-resistance vanishes. Thus

isochronism with the waves is the worst quality that a ship can have as
regards steadiness and safety.

    When the period of unresisted rolling of the vessel exceeds that of the

waves in a greater ratio than that of /^2 : 1, her upright positions occur
after the arrival of the troughs and crests of the waves, and her angle of
heel is less than the steepest slope of the waves.

    The forced or passive oscillations of ships arc those which produce the
most severe strains, because of their continual recurrence, the free oscilla-
tions being gradually extinguished by the resistance of the water. It

                                                * Trans. I. N. A. for 18G3-G4,
STABILITY^ PROPULSION^ AND SEA-GOING QUALITIES OF SHIPS. 37

appears, howeTcr, that the periodic time of the free oscillations has an im-

portant influence on the extent of the forced oscillations, especially in roll-

ing, the most unfavourable proportions for the periodic time of free rolling

to that of passive rolling being those which lie near equality, and between

equality and 2y' : 1 ; for the equality of these periods tends to produce an
excess of rolling to which it would be difficult to fix a limit, and the ratio

V2of : 1, and those near it, make the shij) roll against the waves, thus

throwing her into positions in which there is a risk of the wave-crests

breaking into her.

  A period of free rolling much less than that of passive rolling gives great

stiffiiess, and makes the ship accompany the motions of the effective wave-

Asurface.       period of free roUing exceeding s/ 2 times that of passive rolling

is favourable to steadiness, provided that this lengthened period be produced

by the inertia of the ship, and not by insufficient statical stability.

The action of the water on a deep keel, on a sharp floor, or on fine ends

below water tends to moderate the extent of rolling produced by coinci-

dence, whether exact or approximate, of the periods of tree and passive roll-

ing ; but at the same time it lessens the effect of a long period of free roUing
in producing the same result.

   A deep draught of water is favourable, on the whole, to steadiness, but not

to stifliiess.

Should the centre of gravity rise and fall relatively to the water in roUing,

and the periodic time of the dipping motion so generated happen to be either

exactly or nearly one half of that of the passive rolling, the result will be
uneasy motion.

   The steady pressure of the wind on the sails promotes steadiness, at a
certain angle of heel depending on the moment of that pressure; the sudden
gusts of the wind produce lurching.

As to intchinci, scending, and yawing, it is chiefly important that, for the

Bake of dryness and safety, those oscillations should be performed in a lively

manner  among waves                                                   and  that  object  is  best  promoted  by  keeping  the
                                                                   ;

--longitudinal radius of gyration short, as compared with the length of the

ship that is, by taking care not to place heavy weights in her ends.
   The true principles of a ship's rolhng among waves and their leading

consequences were first set forth by Mr. Proude, in a series of papers in the

' Transactions of the Institution of Naval Architects,' in 1861, 1862, and
1 863. Mr. Froude appears to have been the first to state the proposition

that the tendency of the ship to roU among waves is primarily due to her

tendency to keep upright to the effective wave-surface, and that the force
which induces this tendency is very approximately the same as her stiff-
ness or resistance to heeling in still water. The disposition of a ship' to

follow the average motion of the portion of the wave which she displaces is,

however, controlled (as has been pointed out by Mr. Crosslaud) by the

circumstances that the wave-water is continually undergoing a deformation

of which the ship's huU is not susceptible. Mr. Froude has also shown *

that if two plates be hinged together, so that, when in still water, they
would float at an inclination of 45° to the vertical, and if the hinge be pa-

rallel to the wave-crest, the effect of the wave-motion is simply to open or
close the angle between them, and not to alter (sensibly) the horizontal and

vertical lines which bisect the angle externally and internally.

As there is nothing to show that the rigidity of the angle between the

                * See Trans. I. N. A. vol. vi. for 1865, p. 181.
38 REPORT--1869.

plates would tend to make any marked alteration in the invariability of

direction of the bisectors, the theoretical establishment of this fact is of

great importance. Its meaning is that the effect of bilge-keels is to increase
the time, and, in a greater degree still, to diminish the amplitude of the
oscillation, and that the use of bilge-keels is the direct mode of effecting

this object.

The problem of safe rolling is not quite the same with that of easy

Arolling.     roll towards the wave- crest is well known as one of the most

dangerous things that can happen to a ship in a high-crested sea-way, for

the whole crest of the wave may then break inboard. Even when the ship

follows the oscillations of the vertical lines, the wave-particles come flat on

the ship's bulwarks and side. If she floats quite vertically she is still in the

position of a cliff resisting a wave of the same period, whose height is the

difterence of heights of the surface-wave and of the m^can effective wave

acting upon her.
   As regards the impact of a wave, the most violent blow that a wave can

give is against a surface parallel to the inflexional tangent and to the wave-
crest, and at a level with the line of inflexion. The motion of the particles

is then normal to the wave-surface. This remark, of course, does not apply

to shore-waves.

   Throughout the discussion of the ship's oscillation among waves, it has
been tacitly assumed that the wave-period itself might be regarded as con-

stant. This is very far from either representing the facts or the practical

problem of the shipbuilder. The wave which a vessel has to encounter may

be anything, from the 11-seconds wave, 600 feet long, to a mere ripple.
Practically, a vessel will not roll to waves whose length is much less than
her breadth, nor will she pitch much among short waves. But, dismissing

these from consideration, it may still be impossible to avoid some contin-
gency in which a ship's period of free rolling may be equal to the wave-

period. Obviously, the remedy in this case is for her commander not to
keep her hroadskle-on. As a rule, no commander ever would do so in a
dangerous sea-way ; and even where comfort only is concerned, it is usually

open to him either to shorten the effective (that is to say, the apparent
wave-period) by putting her head a little to the swell, or to lengthen the

apparent wave-period by putting her head a little ofi'. He must do one of

these things if he meets with actual and exact synchronism in anything like

heavy weather.
   As a practical matter. Professor Rankine remarks : " It would appear

that a very close approximation to the form and proportions which are
most favourable to steadiness has, in some cases, been realized by practical

trials alone, and that independently of the steadying action of sails ; for

there are vessels which, when under steam alone, in any moderate swell

keep their decks very nearly parallel to the horizon. It is of great im-

portance that the lines and dimensions, and distribution of the weights of
ships, which have been found by experience to possess tliis excellent quality,

should be carefully recorded for the information of naval architects.

   " On the other hand, there are vessels (especially screw- steamers) whose
ordinary extent of rolling each way is from three to four times the slope of

the waves."

    This is a thing which has seldom been done with any degree of accuracy.
Not only is the vessel moving, but the apparent direction of gravity is not
the true one. The result is, that the difference of direction between the
tangents to two waves from a point a little behind the spectator is generaUj-

taken for the apparent angular height. This may evidently be far in excess

of the true apparent height *.

--40 REPORT 1869.

Admiral Paris has invented a self-recording instrument for the purjiosc

Aof measuring- both the height and form of waves.  description of this will

he found in the Trans. I. N. A. vol. viii. 1867, p. 279. It is unfor-

tunately a differential instrument, Avithout any means of getting a good

datum line. It appears to he much better adapted for getting approximate

profiles of complex waves than for obtaining accurate measurements of

simple ones.

   Observations on the lengths of waves present much less diiRculty: a
float, sunk so as not to catch the wind (such as a bottle), and observed from
a considerable height, wiU give the periodic time with a fair degree of ac-
curacy, and the length may be inferred from the period.

   General observations upon waves* are not in point. The object in the-

present case is to ascertain what the particular waves are in which the

ship's rolling is being observed.

                       Measurement of Boiling.

It is very well known that a pendulum at sea docs not give a vertical

line, but a direction due to the joint cfiect of gravity, of its own free oscil-

lation, and of the forced oscillation due to the motion of its point of sus-

Apension.  suspended clinometer is thus perfectly useless for this purpose.

Uaromctcrs, cuddy-lamps, and chandeliers generally oscillate through larger

angles than the ship.

   Mr. Froude (Trans. I. N. A. for 1SG2, p. 41) suggests watching the

rattlins of the rigging come down to the horizon, as a ready and fairly
correct way of measuiing the roll. The motion of the mast-heads rcla-
livcly to the stars may be used in the same waj'.

M. Normand, jun., of Havre, has invented a very ingenious clinometer

suspended on gymbals, like a chronometer, in such a way as to be as little

Weas possible influenced bj' the ship's motion f.  do not consider that any

instrument depencUng upon gravitation is to be relied upon at sea, and

we have been informed that M. Normand himself is not quite satisfied with

his instrument.
    Apart from observations depending on the stars, or actual sea-horizon,

the only instrument that can be relied ujion as giving an invariable plane is

Aof the gyroscope class.  modification of Foucault's gyroscope was tried in

the North Sea in 1859, by Professor C. Piazzi Smyth, who gave an account

of the instrument and its performance in the Trans. I. N. A. for 1863,

p. 118.

   An instrument upon the same rotatory principle, but self-recording, has

been invented by Admiral Paris, Hydrographer of the French Imperial

Navy. It consists of a spinning top, with its point of support above its

centre of gravity. It spins in an agate cup, and the top of the spindle

carries a camel's-hair pencil which marks a paper band, driven by clock-

work, and passing through bent guides so as to keep close to the pencil.

It is described, and some of its curves copied, in the Trans. I. N. A.

vol. viii. for 1867.

   What these instruments really give is the deviation from an undeter-

mined direction. They therefore give the time of rolling or pitching, and of

any intermediate oscillation of a periodic character, and the amplitude of

                       * Although very desirable for other reasons.

deviation from the mean line ; but they evidently would not disclose any

steady inclination to which the rolling might be superadded.

   The gyroscope or top will, of course, have its own proper oscillatory revo-

lution, which, however, soon spins out, on the same principle that a peg-top
" sleeps."

   On the whole, there does not seem to be much room for improvement in

Admiral Paris's instrument, unless, perhaps, in diminishing the atmospheric
resistance. Possibly also provision might be made for adjusting the point of

support to the centre of gravity.

The mathematical theory of rolling is very far from easy, and leads to equa-

tions of which there is no known solution. The time of a common pendulum,

for instance, depends upon an elliptic integral, and, beyond the degree of

complexity involved in such a function, mathematics are in the condition of

uncleared ground. Accordingly, while it is possible to give a rational

account of the immediate gross results of a compound oscillation, these

results cannot be expressed or measured with the requisite combination of

generality and accurac3^ In order to treat them, we are obliged to intro-

--duce simplifying suppositions, which do not necessarily belong to our pro-

blem as, for instance, isochronism, or the neglect of certain elements of

resistance, or the grouping of others.

Now, Avhen this occurs with any branch of practical knowledge, the proper

mode of applying mathematical investigation is to start, not from the known

principles of general mechanics, but from an advanced base of observations

peculiar to the science itself. In hydrodj-namics, between minuteness and

number, the ultimate molecular unit escapes our notice, and we are only

able to observe effects in the gross ; being thereby driven to a certain want
of detail, both of observation and of reasoning, which allows us to trust our
conclusions only when they have been made to rest on a broad experimental
foundation. Whether we regard the theory of the propulsion of ships, or

that of their rolling, our analysis has assuredly been pushed quite to the
extreme verge to which general reasoning can be trusted ; and a largely in-

creased extent of exact observation ought to precede further attempts at

Weinductive reasoning on these subjects.   have many exact experiments on

propulsion, although, from the complicated character of the phenomena in-

volved, it is difficult to separate the issues ; and this wiU probably not be set

right without further special investigation. With regard to rolling, how-
ever, we have much vague observation, and but little exact knowledge de-

rived from experiment.

  We are not aware of any one published experiment on the rolling of ships

in waves in which the details necessary to make any mathematical use of
the results are supplied. The data required are, as a minimum for each

case,

  A1. draught of the ship, and her calculated elements.

2. The position of her centre of gravity.

3. Her periodic time in still water.

4. The condition of her wet surface.

5. The extent and period of her roll.

6. Was the rolling simple, or mixed with pitching ?

7. The height, length, and period of the waves in which she was rolHng.
8. Were these waves simple ?

9. What alterations have been made in her displacement, her trim, and
42 REPORT--1869.

the position of her -weights, as regards both centre of gravity and moment of

inertia, previously to the trial ?

10. Force and direction of wind, and condition of ship as regards re-

sistance to it.

   11. FuU details as to manner in which, and the iastruments or calcida-

tions by which, these data have been ascertained.
   There is no doubt that for a comprehensive view of the subject, it would

be necessary that these things should be ascertained with care for a large

number of ships, of various classes, and under very varied conditions. Eut
this is too much to expect to get done, although we think it would be a
good thing for the Government, and other large shipowners, to keep in view
as an ultimate object. McauwhUe we think it would be a very great expe-

rimental aid to science if these things could be accurately settled for even

two or three ships, under different circumstances of weather and different

arrangements of weight, both in amount and distribution.

Similar experiments should also be made with reference to pitching.

The trials should be made with sails furled, and as little disturbance from

Weheadway as possible.  have every wish to have parallel experiments

tried under any possible conditions of sail and propulsion, and, if it may be

done, on the same ships, consecutively with the simpler experiments ; but it

will be seen that the data are already sufficiently complex at the best, and

that they must be used clear of headway and leeway before they can be

discussed with reference to these.

   No experiments are of use for the purpose of inductive reasoning in which

any one of the data mentioned above are wanting.

We think that the Government might fairly be asked to institute such a

Weset of calculations and experiments.  cannot find that the exact infor-

Wemation which we have suggested is in existence anywhere.  are certain

that it has not been published in any available form ; and we have reason to

believe that the knowledge is quite as much needed and desired by the

gentlemen responsible for the construction of the navj^ as by merchant

builders or by students of theorj'.

  We therefore recommend that the deputation previously mentioned with

reference to the experiments on resistance be also instructed to urge upon
the Admiralty the importance, both practical and theoretical, of instituting

such a set of experiments, of providing suitable instruments for recording

Weexact observations, and of publishing the results.  also recommend the

appointment by the Council of the Association of a committee of three mem-

bers to confer with the officers of the Admiralty as to the drawing up of
detailed instructions for conducting these experiments; and that the Lords

of the Admiralty, in the event of their assenting to the proposals, be

requested to nominate a committee to confer with the committee named by

the Association.

   In conclusion, we beg leave to recommend that this Report be officially

communicated to the Councils of the Institution of jS^aval Architects, the

Institution of Civil Engineers, and the Institution of Engineers in Scotland,

and the cooperation of those bodies sought, both in applying to the Govern-

ment and in making known among shijibuilders, and other persons con-

nected Avith Naval Architecture, as weU what is the state of our existing

knowledge as what are the immediate desiderata for its extension.

                                      Mr. Fronde's Exj^Ianations.

    The subject of a ship's resistance is one -which I have for many years been

 independently investigating, both theoretically and experimentally; and I
 have been thus led to conclusions which are in very material respects at

 variance with those -which Mr. Merrifield has placed on record for the Com-

 mittee as representing the existing state of knowledge respecting it, and
 specially at variance with the consequent recommendations which he has
 drawn up, as indicating the experiments for the performance of which the
 assistance of Her Majesty's Government is to be sought : I thus find myself
 somewhat abruptly placed in a position in which I must ask permission to
 present, as part of our proceedings, a supplementary report explaining the

reasons which oblige me to dissent from the recommendations to which I
refer. Until the Draft Eeport was in my hands, I was unaware that Ke-'·'

 sistance" was regarded as included in the list of subjects submitted to the
 Committee; for I understood the terms "Stability" and "Sea-going quali-
 ties" as having reference to the theory of " EoUing motion," and " Propul-
sion" to the theory of the Action of Propellers. The subject of Resistance
 appeared to belong already to the " Steamship Performance Committee."

    Let me say at the outset that Mr. Merrifield's very full discussion of this
subject appears to me to set forth most lucidly what must be called " the
existing state of knowledge" respecting it; it has evidently involved much

laborious research and deep consideration.

   And, on the other hand, the results at which I have arrived are in many

respects so far from complete that I have hitherto hesitated to bring them
before the public. But I believe I have so fully established those conclusions,
to which I shall now refer, and the difference in the Hne of action to which
they point is so serious that, under the present circumstances, I feel bound
to press them on the notice of the Committee.

    The Eeport specially recommends, as the experiment which it is important
to try, the dynamometric determination of the scale of resistances for a

full-sized ship.

   Now, -without impugning, or rather, while fully asserting that any scale of

resistance, in terms of velocity, accurately determined for a full-sized ship,
would be of real value and of great interest, I shall nevertheless contend (1)

that experiments on the resistances of models of rational size, when ration-
ally dealt -with, by no means deserve the mistrust -with wliich they are usually

regarded, but, on the contrarj', can be relied on as truly representing the
resistances of the ships of which they are the models ; and (2) that in order
properly to open up the question, so great a variety of forms ought to be
tried that it would be impossible, alike on the score of time and expenditure,
to perform the experiments with fuU-sized ships. Both these propositions
require to be drawn out at some length. The kindred proposition, that as
accurate results can be obtained far more easily and rapidly in experimenting
with a model than -with a ship, though of great importance, is so obviously
true as to require no elucidation.

   The natural expectation that the ascertained resistance of a model will
furnish a measure of the resistance of a ship similar to the model, depends
on the prima facie probability that the resistance for a given body wiU vary
as the square of its velocity ; and that in comparing similar bodies of different
dimension at a given velocity, the resistance will be as the square of the

dimension, since that function expresses alike the proportion of the respec-

tive midship sections and of the respective £riction-.bearing surfapes. Were
--44 REPORT 1869.

these propositions true, the ascertained resistance of a model, at given velo-

city, would supply a complete scale of resistance for all velocities, both for
the model and for any ship similar to the model.

    Since, however, the resistance of a model or ship deviates from the law of

the square of the velocity, as under certain cuxumstances it is known to
do, in a manner dependent on its actual dimensions, it is obvious that
the simple scale of comparison, which seemed prima facie probable, can he no

longer accepted, and it has hence been hastily concluded that no assignable

scale of comparison can be found instead.

   Now it appears to me to be pretty well established, and it is scarcely

questioned, that, for deeply submerged bodies of tolerable size and fair shape,
the resistance does foUow the law of the squares with a high degree of
approximation. Such deviations from this law as appear in Beaufoy's expe-
riments are, I think, explicable by the angularity of the shapes tried and by
the mode of trying the experiments, under which the considerable distance
between the bodies tried and the conducting float by which they were carried
involved some deviation of the body from true axial motion, when the velocity
and the consequent resistance became considerable.

    That surface-friction, in particular, follows the law of the squares of the
velocity very closely, is well established by the experience of the flow of

water through pipes, in reference to which, I may observe, I have myself

experimentally verified on a five-mile length of 9 -inch pipe, the law that the
deiiveiy is almost exactly as the square root of the steepness of the hydravdic
gradient. The experiments were tried with very great variations in the steep-
 ness*. N'ow Professor Rankine's admirable stream-hue investigations have
 definitely established the conclusion that for symmetrically shaped bodies of
 "fair" lines, not excluding by that description certain very blunt-ended

ovals, when wholly submerged, the entire resistance depends on the conditions

of imperfect fluidity, of which surface-friction is the only one so considerable

that we need take account of if we deal with bodies of rational dimen-

 sions ; and this, as I have pointed out, does follow the law of the squares.
 I set aside the condition of "viscosity"; for though this defect, even as it

 exists in water, is certainly sufficient to afl'ect difl'erently the resistances of
 bodies of different dimensions, this is not sensibly the case unless the bodies

 are very minute ; and havrag regard to the great vitality of such small sur-
 face-waves as (say) one foot in length, and to the fact that discharge of water

 through pipes and orifices exhibits no results indicative of this special action,
 unless the diameters are very small indeed, it seems extremely improbable
 that the resistances of bodies five or six feet in length will be afl'ected by it.

 If, therefore, we were deahng with submerged bodies, we shoidd have no
 reason to mistrust the primd facie deductions founded on experiments with

 models.

    "When, however, we deal with a body moving at the sui-face, we at once

 meet with a vera causa, which alters those simple relations that exist be-
 tween the resistances of differently dimensioned submerged bodies. This
 vera causa is the generation of surface-waves, which accompanies the transit
 of the body along the surface ; and it is, I believe, not merely the only

 known cause, but a suificient one.
    What absolute conformation and magnitude of waves a given vessel moving

 with a given velocity may create, and what excess of resistance may thus bo

     * Though I regard these experiments as sufficiently conclusive in reference to the point

 to which they were directed, I am inclined to think tliat the theory of surface-friction in

  its application to a ship's resistance requires considerable reyision.
       STABILITY, PROPULSION, AND SEA-GOING QUALITIES OF SHIPS. 45

developed in any individual instance, it is not necessary for the present pur-

pose to determine ; for it will appear that, whatever the excess may be, how-
ever abnormally, in virtue of it, the law of resistance for any given ship may
vary in terms of her velocity, a very simple scale of comparison wiU express

the relation between the excess as developed in a model and as developed in

a ship similar to the model when moving at a corresponding velocity. I

shall show, in fact, that if the velocities of the ship and the model are as the
square roots, these excesses of resistance thus arising wiU be as the cubes of
their respective dimensions, a law which, as is easUy seen, expresses also the
relation founded on those elements of resistance which vary as the square of
the velocity and as the squares of the respective dimensions.

   The principles on which Professor Eankine's stream-line investigations are
founded establish generally, in relation to all wholly submerged symmetrical
bodies moving in a fluid infinitely extended on all sides, that the stream-line
displacements which the motion of the body imposes on the surrounding
volumes of fluid are, for a given body, identical in configuration for aU velo-
cities (an identity which assigns to them always a velocity proportional to
that of the body itself), and that the configuration is similar for all similar

bodies.

   If we now suppose that the body is moving along the surface of the fluid,
and if we imagine the surface to be not under the influence of gravity or any

such force, it is obvious that here also the configurations of the stream-line
displacements wiU be identical at all velocities for the same body, and will be
similar for similar bodies, including those displacements which consist of
upward disturbances of the surface.

   When we impose the further condition appropriate to an existing water-sur-
face, that the replacements of the surface, when disturbed, are governed jointly

by gravity and by the volumes and velocities of the original impiilses of dis-

turbance, it follows that those impulses of disturbance, being similar for all

similar bodies at aU velocities, will retain their similarity wherever and in

the manner which the operation of gi'avity permits : and this will be when
the similar bodies are moved with velocities proportioned to the square roots

of their respective dimensions ; in these a similar wave-configuration will,
in each case, similarly dispose of the originally similar volume of displace-
ment, since similar-waves have their velocities so related.

    These waves (as is explained by Professor Eankine), when the velocity
proper to their length along the line of motion is exceeded by that of the

 ship, so that they cannot squarely travel with her, satisfy the conditions of
their motion by travelling obliquely, and diverging into the surrounding

fluid, the angle of divergence and their size forming a measure of the work
constantly running away from the ship, and consequently of the resistance
 caused by theii' generation.

   Xow the similarity of the configuration which has been asserted involves

the condition that when the velocities of similar ships are as the square roots

 of their respective dimensions, the angles of divergence will be equal, and
 therefore equal lengths of similar wave-crest will be " run ofi' " for equal
 distances travelled by the respective ships ; and hence the energy abstracted
 in each case by',thesc equal lengths of similar wave-crest is clearly as the cube
 of the dimension (since the mass elevated is as the sectional area, and the
 elevation is simply as the dimension) ; and since the forces which supply
 proportionate amounts of energy while travelling a given distance must
 be as the energy, it follows that the excesses of resistance thus called into
 existence are also as the cube of the dimension, agreeing in this respect, as
--46 REPORT 1869.

has already been pointed out, with the resistances derived from the surface-
friction. In fact, vre are thus brought to the scale of comparison which was

just now enunciated, that the entire resistances of a ship, and similar model,

are as the cubes of their respective dimensions, if their velocities are as the
square roots of their dimensions.

    In verification and illustration of the foregoing views, I tried, in the
autumn of 18G7, a large number of resistance-experiments with a pair of
models of contrasted forms, six feet long, by towh:g them simultaneously
from the ends of a pair of ten-foot scale-beams connected with self-recording
dynamometric apparatus, and mounted on booms projecting sideways from the

nose of a steam-launch, lent me for the purpose by Mr. Bidder. The water-

lines of the models arc shown in Plate I. fig. 1. One was of the wave-line
type, the other, having the same length, form of midship -section, and dis-
placement, had large rounded ends. I also tried similar experiments with a
pair of very nearly similar models of twice the dimensions and eiglit times the
displacement. I had already obtained a series of experimental results of the
same kind, but with less successful apparatus, from a similar pair of models,

three feet long. These data enabled me to compile for each model a dia-

gram of resistance iu terms of velocity.
    The three pairs of such diagrams, proper to the three pairs of models, were

laid down to scales corresponding to the dimensions of the models, according

to the system of comparison I have enunciated ; thus the velocity-scale for

the six-foot models is \/2 times, and that for the three-foot models twice
as open as that for the twelve-foot models ; and the resistance-scales for the
six-foot and three-foot are respectively 8 and 04 times as open as that for

the twelve-foot. According to my proposition, were the three sets of models

exactly similar the three sets of diagrams should be identical.

   Ileduced copies of these diagrams are shown in Plato I. figs. 2, 3, 4.

Their general agreement, especially as to the position occupied in the velo-
city-scale by the several saHent features of the curves and as to the relative

resistances of the contrasted forms, is very striking. It is true that on com-

paring the absolute resistances, the correspondence is not so close as it at

first sight appears. Thus the three-foot models exhibit throughout a
decided excess of resistance as compared with the six-foot ; but I think this
is probably attributable to their being small enough to be within the range

of viscosity. On comparing the diagrams of the twelve-foot and six-foot
models, however, we find that it is the larger model that has an excess of
resistance. This excess, which is slight, may be partly due to certain

minor differences of form which had been introduced iu the larger models.

It may also have partly arisen from the fact that the twelve-foot models,
owing to their greater dimensions, swam relatively nearer to the towing-
boat, a circumstance which may naturally have tended to enhance their

resistances.

   On the whole, I think that scries of diagrams supplies a very fair veri-

fication of the alleged scale of comparison.
    Besides thus throwing light on the question of comparison of the per-

formance of similar vessels of different dimensions, these experiments show

very clearly that strange forms may possess merits that are entirely un-
known and unexpected before experiment is made upon them ; for here we

find that an abnormal form (suggested simply by the appearance of water-
birds when swimming), if moving with a high though not excessive ve-
locity, experiences considerably less resistance than the wave-line form, the
accredited representative of the form of least resistance, particularly at high

speeds. This proves that we can have no ground for certainty that wo have
found even an approximation to the hest form, unless we have gone experi-

mentally over almost the whole ground and tested a very wide variety of
shape. But, independently of this aspect of the question, it is, I think, cer-

tain that on very many important questions, such as, for instance, the proper

ratio of length to breadth, there is no really established principle of judg-
ment on which reliance can be placed. Yet most weighty considerations
affecting economy and efficiency are involved in the settlement of even that

single question. Eut unless we build mere experimental ship-sized models,
there seems no possibility of detennining the question by full-scale expe-

riments.

   It is true that the circumstances under whicli my experiments were

tried did not admit of such exactness as to render them absolutely conclu-

sive as the sole basis of the theory of comparative resistance in terms of

dimension. Nor do I bj' any means pretend to be certain that there are

no elements of resistance other than I have taken account of in my theoretical

justification of it; but if any such do exist, they can be detected, and the
laws of their operation discovered with far greater facility and completeness

by small-scale than by full-size experiments. And I contend that unless the

reliability of small-scale experiments is emphatically disproved, it is useless

to spend vast sums of money upon full-size trials, which, after all, may be

misdirected, unless the ground is thoroughly cleared beforehand by an ex-
haustive investigation on small scale.

I. Boiler explosions continue to occur with their accustomed frequency and
fatality. Since the Meeting of the British Association held last year in
Norwich not less than 46 explosions have occurred, by which 78 persons
have been killed, in addition to 114 others having been injured ; and as
these catastrophes take place with considerable regularitj-, there is every
reason to apprehend that a similar number of explosions, causi7ig the loss of
a similar number of lives and a similar amount of bodily injury, wiU trans-
pire before the next Meeting of the British Association, unless some very
immediate measures are adopted for arresting these sad disasters.

    The fearful explosion which occurred on the 9th of Juno last, at Biugley,

by which as many as fifteen persons were killed and thirty-three others in-

jured, some of them veiy seriously, will be fresh in the remembrance of
every one ; more especiullj- from the fact that amongst those killed and in-
jured were a number of women, having no connexion whatever with the
works at which the explosion occurred, as well as a number of little children.
These children were exercising in an adjoining playground, when just as
48 REPORT--1869.

they were passing close to the wall of a two-storied building on the premises
at which the explosion occurred, the boiler burst, demolishing the building,
burying the children in the ruins, and crushing eight of them to death, in

addition to seriously injuring seventeen others.

   Sad as it is when those connected with boilers and who gain their liveli-
hood from working them arc injured, it is even more so when outsiders, who

have no interest in their use or control over their management, are victimized

by their explosion, more especially when these victims are women and

chUdreu. Such, however, is by no means an infrequent occurrence. In one
case, a child asleep in its bed, unconscious of all danger, was kiUed on the
spot by a fragment of an exploded boiler sent through the roof like a thunder-

bolt. In a second case, a young woman working at her needle in an upstairs
room in her own dwelling, was struck by a boiler which was hurled from its
seat, and dashed against the window at which she sat. The injury she received

was serious ; her leg had to be amputated, and death shortly after ensued. In
a third case, just as an infant was making its first assay at walking across the
kitchen-floor in a collier's cottage, a fragment of an exploded boiler came crash-
ing through the roof, and striking down the child, killed it on the spot. In a

fourth case, a woman was standing at her own cottage-door with an infimt in
her anus, when one of the bricks sent flying by the bursting of a boiler

struck her little one on the head, and killed it in its mother's arms. In a

fifth case, a group of boys were sporting in a meadow, when the boiler of a
locomotive engine, just drawn up at an adjoining railway-station, burst, and
scattering one of its fragments among the group, killed one of the boys on the

spot, and injured another. In a sixth case, a house in which an infirm old

woman lived, confined to her bed in an upstairs room, was demolished by a

boiler explosion, so that the poor woman, witli the bed on which she lay, was
rudely brought to the ground. In a seventh case, a man passing through a
public thoroughfare on horseback was struck by the debris showered around
by a boiler that happened to explode at the moment ; so that even those
casually passing by the premises at which steam-power is employed are not
safe from the attacks of bad boilers. It is no uncommou thing for dwelhng-
houses in the vicinity of boilers to be invaded on the occurrence of an explo-
sion with huge fragments, and to have tlieir windows and roofs riddled as if
they had been bombarded, while in some cases they are altogether de-

molished. Many other cases similar to the above might be added ; but the
facts already given are, it is thought, sufficient to show that those who use
steam-boilers are not the only parties who sufter from their explosion. Thus

the subject acquires a wider interest, and becomes not only important to

steam-users, but also to the public at large.
    It is therefore desirable that public attention should be tlioroughly aroused

on the subject of steam-boiler explosions, while it is clearly well worthy of
the consideration of the Members of the British Association.

    II. The Committee pass on, in the second place, to state that the attention
of its Members has for years been directed to the cause of these sad cata-
strophes, and that they have invariably found that steam-boiler explosions,
though so complicated and disastrous in their results, have sprung from

causes of the simplest character.

    In some cases explosions arise from the boilers having been originally mal-
constructed, the furnace- tubes, for instance, not having been strengthened, as

experience has shown to be necessary, by encircling rings or flanged seams,
or other approved and suitable means ; and, in consequence of the neglect of

these simple precautious, which may readily be adopted by any one, a con-
       ON coroners' inquisitions on boiler explosions.     49

siderable number of furnace-tubes have collapsed and ruptured, wlien the
rusk of steam and hot water resulting therefrom has been attended -with
the most disastrous consequences both to life and property. Explosions of

this character are particularly prevalent in Corn^Yall, -where it seems espe-

cially difficult to persuade steam-users that a furnace-tube can collapse fronr
any other cause than that of overheating through shortness of water. This

simple but obstinate prejudice makes Cornwall one of the most proHfic

counties for steam-boiler explosions; and the Cornish boiler, which, when

well constructed and strengthened in the furnace-tube as just described, is
one of the safest and most reliable of any, has been raised to the undesirable

notoriety of being tke most exijlosive, simply tkrougk the obstinate pre-

judice just referred to, so that the very county tkat gave tkis boiler birtk and
name is doing more tkan any otker to damage its reputation.

    Other explosions arise simply through defective staying, as in the case of

the boiler that exploded at Aberaman on the 31st of May last, killing four

persons and injuring four others. In this ease the front end of the boiler
was blown out, consequent on the removal of the furnace-tube in order to

metamorphose the boiler (most unwisely) from one fired internally to one

fired externally. When the furnace-tube, which formed a most valuable

longitudinal stay, had been removed, no adequate provision was made for re-

pairing its loss, and the consequence was that the end blew out from sheer

weakness. This explosion is by no means singular; and many similar

cases have been met with in which the flat ends of boilers have been

blown out through unwisely removing the furnace-tube in Cornish boilers in

order to exchange internal firing for external. One other explosion, resulting
from imperfect staying, may be referred to, which occurred on the 28th of

July, 1866, at Tunstall, and resulted in the death of two persons and in

injury to seven others. This boiler was of considerable size, being as muck

as 36 feet long by 9 feet diameter, while it was worked at a pressure of

from 3.5 lbs. to 40 lbs. on the square inch. This boiler, which contained an

internal horseshoe-shaped flue, was constructed with a hemispherical end at
tkc back, and a flat one at the front. The flat end was insufficiently stayed,

in consequence of which it was blown out with the horseshoe-shaped tube

attached to it, and thrown to a distance of about 50 yards in one direction,

while the shell of the boiler recoiled to about the same distance in another.

Alongside this boiler was another, in process of completion, with two boiler-

makers and a boy at work inside it. On the occurrence of the explosion, not

only was the boiler first referred to torn from its seat, as just explained, but

the sister one alongside was tlarown on to a public road, and as this road

happened to be on an incline, the boiler went rolling down, with the men,

the boy, and their tools inside it, so that their predicament was somewhat

similar to that of poor Regulus in his spiked cask.

   Other explosions occur from defective material and workmanship, in illus-

tration of which, the explosion may be referred to which occurred at Norwich

on the 25th of September, 1866, by which the works were laid in ruins,

seven persons killed, and two others injured.

Other explosions, again, arise from defective equipments, the manholes not

being guarded by substantial mouth-pieces, or the boilers not being mounted

with suitable safety-valves, glass water-gauges, or other necessary fittings.

   Many explosions occur from the worn-out state of the boilers, the boilers

being worked on till the plates are so reduced as to be no thicker than

a sheet of brown paper. One such case occurred on the 24th of April, 1865,

at Wigan, and resulted in the death of one person, and in injury to four

others. Another took place at Leeds on the 27th of March, 1866, by which

Atwo persons were killed, and six others injured.  third happened at Collj'-

hurst, Manchester, on the 23rd of December, 1867, by which six persons

were killed and four others injured. Cases of this class are so numerous that

they defy enumeration, and the working on of old worn-out boilers, that

should long since have been discarded altogether, is a prolific source of

explosions.

   Some explosions arise from neglect of the attendants, who have ignorantly

tampered with the safety-valves, or neglected the proper supply of water.
The number of explosions from this cause, however, is not by any means so
great in proportion to those that arise from malconstructed or worn-out

boilers, as is generally supposed ; and many more explosions arise from bad
boilers than from bad attendants, though it is often much to the convenience

of the steam-user to have the blame of an explosion thrown upon the atten-

dant rather than on the boiler.
   Such are some of the leading causes of steam-boiler explosions, all of

which, it will be seen, arc extremely simple ; and the Committee consider

--that, as a rule, boilers burst simply because they are bad bad either from

original malcoustruction, or from the condition into which they have been
allowed to fall ; while they wish to record their o})inion that these lamentable

catastrophes, by which so many persons arc annually killed, arc not acci-
dental, but that they might be prevented by the exercise of common Jcnow-

hclf/e and common care.
   III. The next point the Committee have to consider is, how far the pre-

sent inquiries conducted by coroners as to the cause of boiler-explosions

are satisfactor}\

   On referring to the verdicts returned by coroners' juries on deaths occa-

sioned by boiler-explosions, it appears that the usual verdict is one of " acci-

dental death;" in fact this seems to be returned on nearly every occasion,

whatever the cause of the explosion may be, and even when it has resulted

from the use of an old worn-out boiler, reduced to the thickness of a sixpence.
Added to this, the evidence commonly given at these inquiries is anything
but of a reliable and instructive character. The most visionary theories are
advanced, and the attempt is frequently made to show that explosions are

unaccountable and inevitaljle. Thus no suitable information is given to the

public as to the cause of these sad disasters, and the consequence is that
boiler-makers can p;ilm oif on the public bad boilers, and steam-users employ
them TNith the certainty that if they exijlodc with fatal consequences, they
will, by the help of a coroner and his jury, be pubhcly absolved from all

responsibility, and the event proclaimed to be accidental. After the conclusion

the Committee have arrived at, that explosions are not accidental, but may
be prevented by the exercise of " common Icnowhdge and common care,^' they

cannot but consider that such evidence and such verdicts are eminently un-

satisfactory, and that they call for immediate attention.

   IV. In the fourth place, the Committee have to consider how far the pre-

sent unsatisfactory character of coroners' investigations can bo corrected.

   It has been proposed by the Manchester Steam-users' Association that

every coroner, when holding an inquiry on a steam-boiler explosion, should
be both empowered and instructed to avail himself of the assistance of two

competent engineers having no connexion with the works at which the

exjilosion occurred, and that these engineers should visit the scene of the

catastrophe, investigate the cause of the explosion, and attend the inquest in

order to assist the coroner in his examination of witnesses, as well as to give
ON coroners' inquisitions on boiler explosions.  51

evidence themselves before tlie jury, and report on the cause of the explosion,
their reports (which might either be joint or several, as found most con-
venient in each case) being accompanied Avith explanatory scaled drawings,
showing the original construction of the boiler, and as far as possible the
lines of rent, as well as the direction in which the parts were thrown, and
the distances at which they fell ; while, in order to secure to the public the

full advantage of the investigation, it is further proposed that the engineers'
reports, with the accompanying drawings, along -with the verdict of the jury,
should be printed and deposited in the Patent Office, and lie there for in-
spection and purchase, as in the case of specifications of inventions ; and also

that copies of these Heports should be forwarded to the members of both
Houses of Parliament, as in the case of rei^orts on railway catastrophes, as
well as to the various free libraries and scientific societies throughout the

country.

   The Committee consider that the adoption of this proposition would very
much raise the character of the present inquiries conducted by coroners, and
that tlie measure is well calculated to secure the truth being fully arrived at
and plainly spoken, to which they attach the greatest importance.

   The fact of two engineers being appointed to investigate and report, those
engineers being altogether independent of the works at which the explosion
occurred, would, it is thought, secure an unbiassed opinion, while from the
publicity given to tlie verdict, the coroner and jury woiild be stimidated to
make a searching investigation. It is possible that in some cases, more
especially in the early adoption of this i^lan, some coroners might not select
the most competent engineers to assist them in their inquiry ; but this, it is
thought, is an error that would soon be corrected from the publicity it is pro-
posed to give to the whole proceedings, which would make the coroners
careful to make a wise selection for the sake of their own reputation, while,
as they would not be limited in their choice to a sj)ecial locality, but might
take the range of the whole country, there would be no difficulty in their finding
thoroughly competent men. Were two competent engineers selected, the
Committee consider there would never, or at all events but very seldom, be
any practical difference in their views as to the cause of an explosion ; but
presuming that in a few instances such might be the case, the Committee
woidd not recommend that, as a rule, a third party should be called in to
decide the point, since such a question should not be decided simply by a
majority of opinions. The better plan would be to record the facts and
the conclusions arrived at, and to leave to public discussion and time to show
how far the opinions advanced were correct or not.

   One of the results of searching investigations and plain-speaking verdicts
would be, that when a steam-user has killed some half dozen people by the
use of a crazy old boiler, the widows and children of the deceased would be
able to claim from him compensation for the loss of their bread-winners.
This, it is thought, would operate as a most wholesome check both upon
boUer-makers and boiler-users, as the one party would be exposed if he sold
a bad boiler, and the other if he bought it. Some timid steam-users object
to this measure, lest they should ever be brought in for heavy damages ; biit

such fears may be altogether dismissed by all those who are working honest

boilers. Good boilers, as already stated in this Peport, do'not burst. Explo-
sions are not mysterious, inexplicable, or unavoidable. They do not happen

by caprice, alike to the careful and the careless. They may all be prevented
by the exercise of common knowledge and common care, so that timid steam-
users may dismiss their apprehensions as long as they are doing their duty by

                                                                          e2
52 REPORT-- 1869.

their boilers and boiler-attendants. These improved investigations would at
the same time have a most wholesome effect upon the operations of boiler-
inspection associations and boiler-insurance companies, as in the event of the
explosion of an enrolled boiler, the case would be fully investigated by im-
partial parties, and the facts brought to light. Such a course would clearly
promote sound inspection.

    Thus the Committee consider that the adoption of this measure would have
so wholesome an influence upon boiler-makers and boiler-users, as well as
upon boiler-attendants and boiler-inspectors, and indeed upon all those con-
nected with the use of steam, that it would, without any further Governmental
interference, do much to prevent the recurrence of steam-boiler explosions,
and they warmly concur with the proposition.

    With regard to the manner in which the expense of these investigations
should be defrayed, the Committee recommend that this should be met from
the same source that coroners' inquiries are met at present, viz. either from
the county or city rates, as the case may be. This course is deemed better
than that of throwing the cost of the inquiry upon the owner of the exploded
boiler by way of penalty, as in many cases his resources would be so drained
by the catastrophe as to be insufficient to meet the charges ; while, in
addition, it is thought that scientific witnesses, called upon to discharge so
important a public duty as that now jn'oposed, should not be dependent on so
uncertain and invidious a source for remuneration.

    It has been proposed that the Crown should levy a heavy deodand on the
owners of all boilers that explode, unless it could be shown that the explosion
arose from causes entirely beyond their own control, the oni;s of the proof
being thrown on the boiler-owners, and not on the Crown. Such a measure
has, at first sight, much to recommend it. It would doubtless act as a
powerful stimulant to care ; but inasmuch as the relatives of those killed by
boiler explosions arc deprived thereby of their means of support, it is thought
that all payment should go to them in the way of compensation rather than
to the Crown. In many cases the owner of a boiler is so impoverished by its
explosion that, had he to pay a deodand, he would have nothing left to com-
pensate those who were rendered widows and orphans by the catastrophe, so
that the Crown would be robbing them of their legitimate compensation. It
is thought therefore it would be better not to impose any deodand, fine, or

penalty, but to leave the steam-user, in the event of explosion, simply to the
exposure of full investigation and plain speaking, combined with the liability
to an action for damages, which the improved verdicts would give increased
facilities for setting in motion.

    The Committee would wish to add a few remarks upon the misapprehen-
sion that arises from the use of the word " accidental " in the verdicts re-
turned by coroners' juries, and the advantage they think would be derived
from the substitution of the expression " not due to mcdice aforetJiovf/Jit."
The Committee apprehend that the fundamental object of a coroner's inquiry,
in the case of a sudden or violent death, is to determine whether that death

was occasioned by personal malice or not. Thus it may be legally correct for

the jury to return a verdict of " accidental death " from a steam-boiler

explosion, though the boiler may have been so worn out that, in an engineer-
ing and common sense view, the explosion was no accident at all. Thus the

jury use the word in one sense, but the public accept it in another, and the
term is taken to be an exoneration of the owner of the boiler. It is thouglit
that the obligations of the jury would be fulfilled, at the same time that the
prevention of steam-boiler explosions would be promoted, if juries, instead of
           ON COKONERS' INQUISITIONS ON BOILEK EXPLOSIONS.                 53

rcturuing a verdict of " accidental death,^' would state that tlicy consider

there had been no " mcdice aforetliought," and the following verdict is given

by way of illustration :

" The jury iind that X., X., X., &c. were kiUed by a steam-boiler explosion

that occurred at  street, in  town, on  day of the week, month,

and year, on the i^remises occupied by  ; and while they consider that

these deaths were not occasioned by any ' malice aforeihou{/ht,' either on the

part of the owner of the boiler or others connected with it, they wish to re-

cord the fact that the boiler was a bad one, its plates being considerably

reduced by corrosion, and that it was to tliis cause that the explosion

was due."

   The Committee do not overlook the fact that juries have a third course
open to them, which lies between the announcement of " accidental death "

or " wilful murder," and that they have the power of committing owners

of boilers for " manslaughter," a power which in many cases they arc bound

in the discharge of their duty to exercise, and in the opinion of the Com-

mittee much more frequently than they do. The task, however, of com-

mitting a boiler-owner for manslaughter is frequently an invidious one for a

coroner's jury, and in practice verdicts of manslaughter are very seldom

brought in by them. Were the suggestion thus made carried out, coroners'

juries woidd be extricated from an unpleasant position, and the truth with

I'egard to explosions would be more fully and freely spoken.

 --The following is a recapitulation of the couclusions to which the Committee

have arrived : First, that a lamentable loss of hfe is annually caused by

steam-boiler explosions, which urgently calls for public attention. Secondly,

that these explosions, as a rule, are not accidental, but may be prevented by
the exercise of " common knowledge and common care." Thirdly, that the

jn-csent investigations conducted by coroners with regard to steam-boiler

explosions are eminently unsatisfactory, and call for immediate improve-

ment. Pourthly, that coroners should, when conducting inquiries on boiler

explosions, be instructed and empowered to avail themselves of competent

engineering advice, so that the cause of every boiler explosion may be fully

investigated, while the information acquired should be widely circulated.

Fifthly, the Committee entertain a sanguine hope that tliis course alone

would do much towards the prevention of the present recurrence of steam-

boiler explosions, without any further Governmental action.

Before concluding this Eeport, the Committee feel it incumbent upon

them to allude to the general movement that has taken place within the last

year with regard to the adoption of some system of compulsory inspection.

During the past session a Bill was introduced to Parliament, and carried

through an early stage, for placing all steam-boilers under Government in-

spection, by the agency of the Board of Trade. By others it has been pro-

posed that every steam-user should be compelled to have his boiler examined

and certified by some private association or company instituted for that ob-

ject, and authorized by the Government. Others propose that insurance

should be an essential accompaniment to this arrangement, and that, to secure

the integrity of the service, the boiler-inspectors should themselves be in-

spected by the Government.

With regard to these propositions, the Committee would wish to express a

strong and, as they think, a wholesome dread of any Government inter-

ference with the management of private concerns ; and they cannot but con-

sider that tlie plan proposed of handing over aU the boilers in the country to

the supervision of the Board of Trade would prove harassing to the steam-
--54 REPORT 1869.

user, and a barrier to progress. Such a system, it is thought, must soon

prove a system of limitation. Inspectors armed with Govornmcntal powers
must be guided by a code of rules laid down by some higher and central

authority. They must be instructed what diameter of boiler and what

thickness of plate to allow for certain pressiires of steam, also what area
and description of safety-valves, and what number and description of fittings

generally. Thus the responsibility of construction would be removed from

the boiler-makers to the Government, and the Board of Trade would become

the national boiler constructors. However wisely and liberally such a system

might be worked, and however carefully its code of rules might be devised, it

is feared it would shortly prove an irksome limitation, and that serious em-

barrassment would result. "Whether any milder measures could be intro-

duced to extend the operations of private associations, is a question on which

the Committee are not in a position to pronounce an "opinion at present

but the subject ajjpears to them to be one of considerable importance, and

the more public attention is called to it, and the more it is ventilated and

discussed, the better.

The Committee would venture, however, to submit to consideration,

Avhethcr it woi^ld not be worth while to try the effect of more searching

coroners' investigations, and plain-speaking verchcts, before any other steps

are taken. Were the course recommended herein with regard to coroners

adopted, such a mass of well-authenticated information would soon be accu-

mulated that it would be shortly apparent whctlier this measure were of

itself sufficient to arrest the course of boiler explosions, or whctlier the reck-

lessness of steam-users was so great that more stringent measures were

absolutely necessary ; while, supposing that the latter unfortunately proved

to be the case, the amount of authentic information obtained would form a

sure basis for legislative enactment. The Committee therefore venture to

urge that the plan proposed in this Eeport be fairly tried before any further

steps be taken, and they recommend this subject to the best consideration of

this Meeting of the British Association.

It should not be omitted to mention that since the subject was brouglit

under the consideration of the Mechanical Section of the British Association

last year, the Manchester Steam-users' Association memorialized the Home

Secretary with regard to the improvement of coroners' inquiries in the

manner referred to in this Report. The deputation was favourably received,

and the Home Secretary stated, in his place in the House of Commons, only a

few days since, that he should endeavour, during the Eecess, to prepare a

measure for the prevention of steam-boiler explosions. Thus considerable

attention has been drawn to this subject during the past year, and consider-

able progress has been made in educating public opinion with regard to it.
The Committee think that this affords ground for congratulation, and that,
from the interest now aroused i)i connexion with this subject, the attainment

of the prevention of steam-boiler explosions is not far distant.

   Erankland, F.R.S., and Herbert M'LeoDj F.C.S. (Reporter,

   Herbert M'Leod.)

Ix consequence of the investigation being far from complete, this Eeport

must be considered as merely a prclimiuarj'- one ; a more detailed account of

the results obtained, and the inferences to be drawn from them, must be

postponed till a future occasion.

The apparatus employed in these and other experiments was described at

the last meeting of the Chemical Society, and has been published in the

Journal *.

In collecting the waters it is, of course, of the greatest importance that

they should be prevented from coming in contact with the air, otherwise

serious errors might be produced in the determination of the gases dissolved.

In order to avoid these errors, the tap delivering the water from the jjumps

is connected by means of a caoutchouc tube with a tubulure at the bottom of

a tin cylinder, about 10 inches high and 7 in diameter. The water is turned

on and allowed to flow over the edge of the vessel ; thus only the surface of

the water is exposed to the action of the air, and the liquid at the lower part

of the vessel is protected by the upward ciu'rent and continual overflow.

The bottles used for collecting the waters hold a little more than 100

cubic centimetres, and a separate quantity is used for each experiment.

Into each bottle a piece of glass tube, bent in the form of a U, is intro-

duced ; one end of the tube is sealed, and in the closed limb a bubble of air

is confined by mercury which fills the open limb and the bend. In the col-

lection of each water, four of these bottles are lowered by means of pieces of

string into the tin vessel, while the water is flowing over its edge. After

being filled each bottle is carefully examined, and if any bubbles of gas

adhere to the sides they must be removed. The bottles are then again

Alowered into the vessel and the temperature observed.           siphon is now

passed to the bottom of one of the bottles, and after it has drawn two or

three hundred cubic centimetres of water through the bottle, it is placed into

the second. The first bottle is now raised, and while its neck is still under

the water, a slightly greased stopper is put into the neck and carefully

pressed down. This force compresses the air contained in the glass tube,

and if the pressure is sufficient, it prevents the escape of gas from the water,

a precaution which in some cases is very necessary. The siphon is then

transferred from the second into the tlurd Isottle, and the second is closed and

removed. When the four bottles have been filled, the stoppers are covered

"with ground caps. The caps are next filled with mercury through small

holes at their tops, which are afterwards closed with glass stoppers.

The gases should be removed from the waters as soon after collection as

possible. In the following cases, the greatest length of time which was

allowed to elapse between these operations was five days, but usually the

removal of the gases was effected the day after the collection.

With so few results as have been obtained up to the present, it wiU be

impossible to do more than point out the small quantity of oxygen in the

waters from deep wells as compared with those from shallow ones, and with

rain- and river-waters. The quantity of nitrogen is also very remarkable, as

being in all the cases, except the river- and rain-water, in excess of the

into the foregoing Table numbers taken from Bunsen's ' Gasometry,' indi-
cating the quantities of nitrogen absorbable by 100 volumes of distilled
water at the temperatures which are nearest to those at which the waters
were collected. The reasons of this apparent anomaly will be investigated
during the com-se of the ensuing year, and it is hoped that, by the next
Meeting of the Association, a much larger amoiint of information will have
been obtained. The prosecution of the experiments has been much hindered
by the necessity of pei'fccting the apparatus for the removal of the gases,
and the means of collection, so that it was not nntU after the beginning of
July that any systematic work coitld be commenced. Although the investi-
gation wiU be continued, it is not intended to ask for any additional grant,
as the amount voted last year wiU probably be sufficient.

The Pressure of Taxation on Real Property. By Frederick Purdy,

   Principal of the Statistical Dejjartment, Poor Laiu Board, and one
   of the Honorary Secretaries of the Statistical Society.

[A Communication ordered to be j^rinted in cxtcnso among the Eeports.]

                               I. The Peesstjei;.

The question of the fiscal pressure caused by the incidence of imperial and

local taxation on real property is no new topic in this country. In 1846 the

House of Lords appointed a select committee to inquire into the " Burdens

affecting real property." This committee, of which Lord Beaumont was the

chairman, gathered from various sources a large body of information, and

made in the same session a rather brief report to the House upon the volu-

Aminous evidence which was subsequently pubhshed.  draft report which

Lord Monteagle, one of the members, had drawn up was not accepted; it

was, however, printed as a separate paper by the House of Commons in the

same j'ear.

Both documents have rather an historical than practical interest for us in

the present day. Our imperial financial policy has materially changed since

1846, and the local burdens of that time are quite dwarfed in absolute

amount by recent growths in the same field. It therefore appeared a useful

task to ascertain the taxation laid on real property at this moment with the

greatest precision that authentic records render possible. I propose to do

this statistically ; an economic treatment of the subject would be, no doubt,

as touching the pockets of a large number of people, a more exciting theme.

But admitting that the aggregate of imperial and local expenses must be

provided for, throwing a tax off one description of pi'operty means, in the

sphere of financial policy, placing it on another. The correlation of the

parts would be disturbed ; the wide and intricate field of taxation must then
be entirely reviewed and readjusted, a task of no mean difficulty which

may be fittingly omitted on this occasion.

   The nearest approach, at present, to the annual value of real property in

England and Wales is expressed by some figures supplied to mo by the

courtesy of Mr. Erederick Gripper, Accountant and ComptroUer-Gcneral to

the Board of Inland Eevenue.

They show the gross sum to be upwards of »C145,000,000 for the financial

year 1867-68, thus assessed :

In the British fiscal system real property suflfers an exceptional liability to

taxation. It bears fully tliree-fourths of our heavy and fast-increasing local

rates, and then in a variety of ways it is made to supplement the imperial

budgets. Here I may be permitted to remark that in this country we are
too much in the habit of discttssing our imperial and local systems of rates

and taxes as things apart, yet their conjoint bearing on the interests of the

holders of real property is obvious and practical. This opinion I had the

honour of indicating to Section F, in a brief paper, when the British Associa-

tion last met at Cambridge J.

   The amount of local taxation incident upon real property is now known

   * Salt-springs or woi-ks, alum-mines or works, docks, drains and levels; rights of
markets and fairs, tolls, bridges, and ferries.

   t All other profits arising from lands, tenements, and hereditaments or heritages not
in the actual possession of the party to be charged, and not before enumerated.

It may be well to remember that nearly half of this heavy sum is entailed

tipon the ratepayers by the absolute right to relief which the legislation of

England has given to the poor. The expenditure last year for " relief to the

poor "  was  £7,498,000                                                               but law charges    to the  amount of .£29,000,                                         the

cost of making valuations .£50,000, and "money expended for all other

jHirposes" £532,000, a large portion of which latter sum is solely contingent

on pauperism, are all items that are excluded from what, in official language,

is termed "relief;" though it is patent that if pauperism ceased out of the

land, most of these expenses would be determined. Add a duo proportion of
the excluded items and we may fairly say that, in round numbers, English

pauperism last year cost little short of £8,000,000 sterling.

The imperial taxes that are incident upon realty certainly exceed

£6,000,000 ; they probably approach to £7,000,000. So far as their respective

amounts can be discovered, they are exhibited in the following statement :--

   The succession-duty experiences considerable variations ; according to
l^articulars furnished by Mr. Gripper, the sums collected in England and

Wales for the financial years 1867, 1868, 1869 were respectively £507,081,

£608,297, and £571,831. For the purposes of this paper the average of the

three years has been taken. Fire-iusiu-ance duty has ceased ; it is noted

above as a reminder ; verj' recently it was a tax that largely bore on certain

descriptions of real property. After trial it is found impossible to unravel

the stamp-duties so as to exhibit that iwrtion of the impost with which

alone this paper is concerned.

Allowing for possible defects in the imperial tax table, the aggregate

equivalent to 3s. 2^d. in the pound ; on the net value (the amount '·' charged,"

£136,135,000) it equals 35. 4^<L in the pound. Here, however, it should

be remembered that the standards of comjjarison are themselves averages of

a comprehensive sort; it is not every poimd of gross or of "charged" value
that is taxable. For example, on many estates the land-tax is redeemed*;

the inhabited-house tax is not paid by more than one-sixth of all the house-

holders of the kingdom ; though measured on value alone, more than half the

house-rental pays. The assessment of houses &c. (other than farm-houses)

to the property-tax in 1864-65 was, as already stated, £59,286,000 ; but for
the purposes of the house-tax, the levy was made upon £30,405,000. Again,

many small proprietors, being outside the statutable limit of the income-tax,

altogether escape it. In a word, as a taxable corpus, the valuations here

cited must not be invested with an homogeneity they do not possess.

  AThough the Crown valuations under Schedule be a much truer exponent

of the country's wealth iu real property than any assessment yet made for

the purpose of local ratings, it is nevertheless advisable to give, in a theme

of this kind, some attention to the latter.

There is no information in existence as to the " rateable value " of England

and Wales previous to the year 1840-41. This "rateable," or, as it is

sometimes termed, " annual value," when discovered from returns obtained
by the Poor Law Commissioners from the overseers of that time, was found

to be £62,540,000. The parish officers' valuations were notoriously defective.

The annual value of real property was ascertained by the Commissioners of

the Income- and Property-Tax Acts to be £85,803,000 iu the subsequent
year 1841-42. The whole excess of £23,000,000 or so must not, however,

be ascribed to under valuation in the poor-rate assessment. Some few things

Aare in Schedule that are exempt from poor's rate. The Parochial Assess-

ment Act of 1837 does not appear to have mended matters muchf. The

increase of assessable property, and, latterly, the application of sounder prin-

ciples, introduced by the assessment committees in the practice of valuation,

though yet very short of attainable completeness, make themselves visible

in the next statement :

   In these comparisons no adjustment for the depreciation of the currency
in the earlier part of the century has been attempted. Professor Jevons has
given a table in the ' Statistical Journal'*, showing that, in 1814, gold was
above the standard price of ,£3 17s. lO^d. by 34 per cent., and in the next
year 20 per cent. ; at the latter ratio one-Jifth must be deducted from all
values in 1814-15.

   From the absence of any authentic record of the land under cultivation in
1814-1.5, the means of computing the farm rental per acre are wanting.

We are in a better position now : the rent for the whole kingdom, as well as

for individual counties, can be worked out with. I believe, a useful approach
to accuracy. The rent for all England and "Wales was, in ISGG, ,£1 17.5. 9d.

On the Chemical Reactions of Light discovered by Professor Tyndall.
                  By Professor Morren^ of Marseilles.

[A communication ordered to be printed in exienso among the Reports.]

SrtfCE the last session of the British Associatiou, Mr. Tyndall has published,

in several papers, highly interesting researches on a particular species of

luminous reactions, thus providing physicists and chemists with a new

instrument, both of synthesis and analysis, to which he invites the attention

and investigation of all whom it may concern. In obedience to this scientific

challenge, I have repeated, with the utmost care, all the learned gentle-

man's experiments. I have found them all as rigorously exact as they are

ably described. They refer to atomical evolutions in which wc almost seem

to detect Nature in her most mysterious operations. The molecules of

bodies, when powerfully lighted, the observer himself being in absolute
darkness, may be easily perceived in their infinitely minute motions ; in
following which, Mr. Tyndall, and every one who is passionately desirous

of penetrating the secrets of the constitution of bodies, cannot but feel the

most exciting curiosity. Mr. TjTidall has made rise principally of electric

light, and has caiiscd it to act mostly on organic bodies. I have followed in

this respect quite a different method and object.

   Most favourably situated with respect to solar light, in Provence, where

for months together we enjoy a cloudless sky, I proposed to limit myself to

the iise of solar rays only, and confine myself to those conditions which

the atmosphere afibrds us. I have carefully avoided organic bodies, the

molecules of which are higlily complicated and most difficult to follow in their

multifarious evolutions. I have even preferred the simpler bodies of mineral

chemistry, as offering an easier field of observation to the physicist desirous

of arriving at clear and precise results.

   In this exposition I shall follow, step by step, the order which, without

any preconceived or systematical ideas, directed my successive experiments.

It is, so to say, a journey in an unknown land. I shall thus the better
show the deceptions I met with, the incessantly supervening difficulties,

the necessities of modifying the apparatus, and the various incidents of the

route. I hope by this means the better to illustrate the object I had in view.

 --At the outset I made use of an experimental ajiparatus entirely similar

to Mr. Tyndall's a glass tube 8 to 9 centimetres in diameter and 1 metre

long, fitted at each extremity into a broad brass ring luted with cement,

and carefully ground in the anterior part ; two plain pieces of plate glass,

perfectly transparent, resting on the rings, and slightly lubricated on the

edges with a fatty substance, constituted an air-tight cavity when a vacuum

Awas formed.       glass cock, fitted on each extremity, and let into the

cylindrical rings, allowed me to make the vacuum at one end, and to introduce

at the other the gas or vapour on which the experiments were to be made.

Extreme, if not absolute cleanness and perfectly dry tubes arc indispen-

sable requisites.

   The light arrives in the tube after condensation by a lens which every-

thing induces me to believe was not achromatic in Mr. Tyndall's experi-

ments. In his apparatus, as in mine, two cones are formed joined at the apices,

the first, the converging cone, with an orange-red periphery, the other, the

diverging one, with a violet-blue peripherj^, circumstances wliich I notice

here, because the white molecules which are about to appear wiU often

assume, in passing through them, the hues of the luminous bands in which

they circulate. When a vacuum has been produced in the tube, the light
                    ON THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS OF LIGHT.                       67

passes tlirough it without the couca beiug in the least perceived ; the tube

is optically vacuous ; but wheu the gas or vapour is iutroduced, a blue cloud,

or blue precipitate, of au incomparable delicacy appears after a varying

lapse of time, first at the summit of the cones, then in the converging cone.
As long as the precipitate is of that beautiful blue colour, the light which it
sends to the eye is perfectly polarized as Mr. TyndaU has described it.
Then by slow degrees the precipitate increases, and slowly becomes white,
the light emitted stUl remaining polarized; but as the sides of the tube
lighted by the cones send to the eye light wliich is also polarized, and as it were
the product of a polarizer, the whitish vapour of the cones then behaves like
a thin polarizing lamina under inspection through the Nicol held by the
observer ; and when the two polarization planes are perpendicular to one
another, the whitish cones assume a magnificent blue colour, exactly as a thin

lamina of selenite of the required thickness would do ; but iu proportion
as the white precipitate increases, all polarization disappears. The precipi-
tated molecules become heated, both at the summits of the cones and against
the entrance glass plate, and there arises a motion, slow at first, which

brings to the cones other particles of the body under experimentation, not

yet acted on by the light ; and as these particles, owing to transparency,

appear dark, their iutermiugling with the white particles produces a series

of the most beautiful, varying, and often most regular images, such as

have been described with expressions of genuine admiration by Mr. Tyndall.
   The precipitated molecules seem to increase in diameter, and the two

cones are then resplendent with reflected light. But there are, for the eye,

certain points where the cone takes a fine rosy colour ; and the position of
these points varies in the course of the same experiment. They are some-
times on a line which forms an angle of 45° with the axis of the converging

+cone, sometimes on a line forming an angle of 90° 45° with the same axis.

There is, as in the rainbow, a line of position, and for the precipitated

molecules a zone of cfiicacious rays, which demand special and ulterior

inquiries.

Let me resume the exposition of facts already so well described by the

English physicist.

   It will be easily seen that either a synthesis or a decomposition of a body

has taken place, i. e. a new grouping of the atoms, when under the influence

of concentrated solar light the blue cloud invades the cones.

The first body of which I have attempted the synthesis is that which I

have so often and so easily obtained by electricitj% by causing the induction

spark to pass through a gaseous mixture, formed of one of oxygen, two of

nitrogen, and three of sulphurous acid *. It is the compound which is

formed in the leaden chambers in the preparation of sulphuric acid.

   I submitted the gaseous mixture to the solar action immediately the

compound was produced. The same gaseoiis mixture enabled me to recognize,

like Mr. Tyndall, that the special rays which produce these reactions are
neither the less refrangible cjdorific rays, nor the red rays even when highly
concentrated. I have for this object made xiae of the greatest variety of

--screens smoky quartz, iodine dissolved in bisulphide of carbon, CS", then

coloured glasses, red, orange, yellow, green ; biit I dislike and distrust the
glass screens ; I prefer by far liquid ones. The action produced was insigni-
ficant. It became, on the contrary, extremely energetic with blue and

violet glasses.

It is therefore under the shock of the more rapid oscillations of the chcmi-

cal rays that these reactions arc produced. And here I wish to notice, in

--passing, an interesting fact, important espcciall}' for photographers I mean

the power of intercepting only the chemical rays of solar light, without

stopping the luminous rays, j)ossessed by a solution of hisulphate of quinine,

well filtered and confined, by means of gutta percha, between two glass

plates. This screen, 5 millimetres in thickness, is of an extreme trans-

parency to light ; but the chemical rays are intercepted. It might be advan-

tageously used instead of the yellow glass, which, in photographic opera-

tions, casts on all objects such peculiar hues as to require a special education

of the eye which has to judge of the reactions. This screen proved inestimable

to me, as it allowed of my disposing and regulating the apparatus suitably
beforehand, while it enabled me to permit the chemical rays, which the

screen had intercepted, to act at the proper moment only.

After the experiments on ]S'0'2(80^) (0=8), I tried to unite the most

resistant bodies. I introduced into the tube hydrogen and nitrogen perfectly

pure and dry, and my surprise was extreme when I beheld the formation of

a white cloiid. This iinexpected result, and one which I had considered as

utterly impossible, obliged me to look still more closely into the matter, and

to proceed with still greater caution.

The brass rings at the extremities of the tube were luted with the usual

myresinous cement. Against this cement  first scriiples were now directed ; it

might still contain some volatile essence (spirits of turpentine for instance)

which might have penetrated into the tube when a good vacuum was formed ;

and so small a quantity of matter sufficed perhaps to produce an appreciable

result ; this might have given rise to the unexpected cloud. It became

necessary to suppress these rings and simplify the apparatus, which I efiected

in the following manner.

I took a cylindrical glass tube (a glass with a foot, Fr. eprouvette) 29 to 30

centimetres long and 8 to 9 ui diameter, and 1200 to 2000 cubic centims.

in capacity. The upper edge, somewhat bell-mouthed and carefully ground,

of above 8 raillims. thickness, was slightly lubricated with a little tallow, wax,

Aand oil melted together.  flat square of plate glass, very transparent, was

placed on the oil and sharply pressed down upon it, and some wax was melted

all round the contact surface with a hot iron. At the bottom of the cylinder, on

the side, a glass stop-cock was carefiiUy fitted in. ^Yith this apparatus the

vacuum may be preserved during a long time, even for months together. The

vacuum is produced, and the gases are introduced l)y the stopcock solely. But

there is another method, very important to notice, for introducing into the

Atube the body to be examined, when it is solid or liquid and volatile. very

small quantity of the substance is put into a very fine thin cylindrical txibc,

which is closed with the lamp at both ends after the introduction of the

body, and can be, when necessary, easily broken to pieces by a slight shock

against the tiibc. The mercury gas-holders which receive and conduct the

gases are glass, carefully divided, so as to measure the volume of the gases

experimented on. In lieu of an air-pump I have always made use of a

mercury exhauster, the only apparatus which can be absolutely relied on, and

which enables the operator, when the reaction is completed, to withdraw

the gases from the tube for analysis; the mercury exhauster likewise

enables us to measiure the elastic force of the gases before and after the reac-

tion, and thus indicates the variations of volume of the gas employed.

What therefore gives these experiments a peculiar character is the com-

plete elimination of^aU gaseous vehicles employed to convey the vapour. The

myconditions of  experiments differ in this respect from Mr, Tyndall's.

The tubes, of smaller dimensions, which I have employed do not give

indeed the splendid results which Mr. Tyndall presented to his delighted

audience ; but these tubes are easier to set up and to clean : the mercury

--exhauster possesses moreover another advantage ; it allowed me to ascertain

whether the gases were perfectly dry a most essential point.

   As to the means of conveying the solar light, the process was the following.

A broad mirror receives and reflects horizontally a voluminous pencil of rays

which is refracted by a lens 22 centimetres in diameter and of 40 centi-

metres focal length. The luminous cone is enclosed in a metallic box,

whence it issues to penetrate into the tube through the glass plate. The

summits of the two cones, the converging and the diverging, are situated

pretty nearly in the centre of the tube (A) ; the two cones are therefore easily

visible when the modifications of the bodies contained in the tube are pro-

duced. It must not be forgotten that the periphery of the two cones is

coloiired, as we said before, in consequence of the non-achromatism of the

large condensing lens.

Under these circumstances I was very much surprised to see that a mix-

ture of hydrogen and nitrogen, perfectly pure and dry, produced the reaction

cloud. They had been dried by a very slow passage through pounded glass

which had been calcined and moistened with sulphiu-ic acid, pure and highly

concentrated. I changed the desiccating substance, and successively made

use of potash, chloride of calcium, phosphoric acid, all recently melted. In

the three latter cases the cloud did not appear ; the action was null, and the

solar light passed unperceived. What coiild the s?(?^)7fHr/c acid, then, convey ?

evidently some little sulplmrous acid ; for sulphuric acid is in fact a real

emitter of it, and always adds a certain quantity of it to any pure gas

Avhich passes through it in minute and successive quantities ; and this acts

in fact as an absorbent of the dissolved gas. Therefore hydrogen and nitro-

gen cannot be united by solar influence wlicn perfectly freed from other

gases. Eut, in truth, what could the action of the sulphurous gas be ?

I applied myself to a special study of sulphurous acid, and have ascertained

how easy the decomposition of this gas is. As soon as the light passes through

it, the white cloud appears ; and if its manifestation is followed with care, it

will easily be seen that it is produced not only at the summit of the cones,

but likewise on the blue periphery of the first part of the diverging cone,

and in the interior of the converging cone. I know of no body more

sensible  to luminous  action                              and the  use  of condensed  light  seems hardly
                                                        ;

necessary for the purpose, since the cloud is formed at other points than the

summit of the cones. With this body it is certainly both easy and admirable to
70 EEPORT--1869.

behold the coloured bands which form the outline of the cones ; and then even

the violet rays (scarcely perceptible under ordinary circumstances) can be easily

seen in the interior of the first cone. One may thus easily follow and account

for the varied hues which the whitish vapour assumes when the variations of

temperatui-e waft it about the cones, intermingled with the black streaks

arising from such portions of the gas as have not yet been acted on.

But to return to the sulphurous acid : What was the substance, blue at

first, then whitish, thus obtained '? The two hues so different were merely

--the consequence of a difference in diameter the first hue belonging to

the bodies (perhaps atoms) precipitated in the minutest state of division. The

white and pearly colours appear when the diameter has sufficiently increased,

and goes on stiU increasing. These circumstances induced me to endea-

vour to measure this diameter, a thing feasible by different means, but

not with ease and faciUty by microscopic inspection, however ; for the small

spark-like bodies move too rapidly through the field of the microscope. But

there were other methods. It may be first observed that if you expose sul-

phurous acid for a sufficient length of time to solar action, the precipitated

substance becomes sufiiciently abundant for a sort of haze to become per-

Aceptible in the tube.  part of the gas has been acted on ; and the two

lumiuous cones, when moved about in the tube, find everywhere reflecting

precipitated molecules. If the tube is left long enough in repose and dark-

ness, the cloud collapses, forms a deposit, and the gas is restored to its primi-

tive transparency. If at this jDoint the tube be again placed under solar

action, the same successive phenomena of haze and return to transparency

may be repeated indefinitely, tUl there remains no more gas to be decomposed,

which is a very long process, for the very formation of the precipitate inter-

cej^ts itself the chemical rays which form it.

But since transparency has been produced, a deposit of molecules must

have taken place ; and in this case, if the tube remains in a horizontal posi-

tion and a broad slip of glass be placed inside it, it is on this slip that the

molecules will be found. Their diameter might then be measured, either di-

rectly or by the rings of diffraction ; but unfortunately it became impossible to

use this expedient : the sulphur was dissolved by sulphuric acid ; and instead

of the molecules which I expected to find, very small drops only were per-

ceived. But nevertheless it was possible to obtain the molecules of sul-

phur in large quantities, and to submit it to all reqiiisite reactions so as to

recognize it completely. It is sufficient to place in the tube after the

sulphurous acid three or five cubic centimetres of distilled water ; and after

the solar rays have sufficiently acted on the gas, the tube is then shaken

the water dissolves the sulphuric acid and renders it powerless for dissolving

the precipitated sulphur ; the water then becomes milky and the sulphur

is collected. It is then boiled in a small glass vessel (to di'ive out the sul-

phurous gas) and filtered in order to collect the sulphur ; the water then

gives abundant proof of the presence of sulphimc acid.

The atoms of the molecules of sulphuj'ous acid are therefore not able to

support the shock of the undulations of the chemical rays ; they divide into

sulphur and sulphuric acid, 3 S0^=S + 2S0^ (and from the form

C&kmD>they change to    '^^ '"'^ich state they are able to resist the shock of

the chemical rays) ; but they exhibit other phenomena, to which I shall return
ON THE CHEMICAL REACTIONS OF LIGHT.                                            71

a little further on. During sixteen days of uninterrupted sunshine, from the

14th to the 31st of July, I exposed to solar light 1900 cuhic centimetres of

sulphurous acid in a tuhc of 2000 cuhic centimetres capacity ; and the

decomposing action was, after that lapse of time, heing still carried on in an

always sensible and wonderful manner. It was CAadent that every day the

solar action was only partial ; it stopped as soon as the precipitated molecules

of sulphur in motion in the tube were abundant enough to intercept all the

chemical rays as an opaque screen.

The action of light on sidphuric acid was interesting to study ; it is one of

the most beautiful and instructive experiments which can be executed. It

smokes abundantly on exposure to air ; and this effect is attributed to the
absorption of aqueous vapour by this substance. This is not a correct ex-

planation, since in a perfectly dry vacuum the same phenomenon takes place.
In the tube with a dry vacuum of i to -^ of a millimetre I had introduced a

very fine thin tube contaiaing anhydrous sulphuric acid. '\Mien I broke the

tube, the Uttle explosion, and certainly the great and sudden expansion of

the substance, scattered about the vapour of the sulphiu-ic acid, which, owing

to the cold generated, was condensed into a white cloud, and appeared with a

dazzling resplendency in the luminous cones. Here the chemical rays are

powerless, they cannot destroy what they have produced. There is no more

decomposition, but sulphuric acid is, if I may use the comparison, like water

in the vesicular state in a cooled medium through which heat is about to pene-

trate. Insensible to the chemical rays, the sulphuric acid absorbs the calorific

rays, on the contrary, with prodigious energy. This absorption is so perfect

that all molecular motion ceases instantly. The molecules remain motionless,

as if busy in absorbing the heat ; and, as aqueous vapoui' does when heated,

they pass into the state of a transparent gas, assuming previously to their

apparent annihilation aU the most magnificent hues. If during the operation

the cock is rapidly opened and immediately closed, the great movement

of molecules so rapidly and so energetically produced ceases at once, by

the absorption of the heat.

This invisible vapour, when stiU further and sirfficiently heated, wiU have

its component atoms so shaken by the amplitude of their new osciUatory

vibrations that they will be removed beyond the radius of their sphere of ac-

tion, and the molecular edifice of sulphuric acid is (in its turn) destroyed.

I am afraid of fatiguing the attention of my hearers if I dcvelope at a

greater length the details of various experiments made with a large number of

Wegases and vapours.  must stop here. Yet what residts are to be noted

Thus, for instance, in the most natural, perhaps, of all the groups that

constitute the family of metalloids (that which comprises chlorine, bromine,

iodine, fluorine) strange anomalies arc observed. Chlorine and hj-drogen

unite under the action of chemical rays and form hj'drochloric acid. The

latter, either dry or humid, and prepared with pure crystals of mineral salt
of chloride of sodium, cannot be decomposed by chemical rays of solar light

whereas hydriodic acid, on the contrary, can be decomposed ; it is true (and

this circumstance must not be overlooked) it is very difficult to procure this

Agas free from atmospheric air. curious circumstance in the examination of

hydriodic acid is, that the first shock of light frees part of the iodine, which
appears with its peculiar violet hue at the summit of the cones, amidst the

--movements which destroy the molecular edifices movements, perhaps, pro-

duced by the calorific rays only.

   Bromine presents the peculiarity, that (as in the case of hydrogen with
chlorine) if piire and dry hydrogen is introduced with a small quantity of
73 KEPORT--1869.

bromine into the little tube which is placed inside the cylinder previously to the
experiment, and which is broken before it is submitted to solar action, after
a few seconds the brownish colour of the bromine disappears and hydrobromic
acid is formed, smoking abundantly on contact with atmospheric air.

    I could increase stUl further the list of bodies submitted to this interesting

means of investigation and experiment. I shaU limit myseK to a summary of

the theoretical considerations which these facts have impressed on my mind.
  We know that the calorific, luminous, and chemical rays are placed side by

side and are even intermingled in the solar spectrum, with undulatory lengths

successively decreasing.

   Now aU chemical bodies may be classed in two series : the first (having sul-

phurous acid for prototype) comprises all bodies formed under the action of
calorific rays ; the second (having hydrochloric acid for prototj'pe) comprises
aU bodies formed by the chemical rays.

   The following are the conclusions which the foregoing facts induce me to

admit :
    If a body is formed and maintained under certain oscillatory conditions,

the peculiar oscillations of the atoms Avhich constitute its molecules must
differ from those of the medium in which the body has been produced. But
if this body is transferred into another medium in which it meets with oscil-
lations isochronous to those of its own atoms, these oscillations increase, and

the vis viva which the atoms acqviire may become so great as to drive the

atoms beyond the radius of their sphere of action ; the atomic edifice is de-
molished ; and as the constitutive atoms preserve, nevertheless, their peculiar

affinities, they form a now edifice adapted to the oscillatory conditions in
which they are now situated. Thus they escape the shocks of the generating
medium, by ceasing to vibrate synchronously with it, exactly as an elastic
sonorous body docs not vibrate and gives no sound when the aerial vibrations

 which strike it are not synchronous with those which it is capable of re-

producing. But if the new edifice is again submitted to the action of other

 syTichronous rays it is again demolished.

    Most curious evolutions ! They seem to ask of the chemist :
    1°. Under what peculiar cii'cumstances and influences are bodies formed?
    2". Under what vibrations precisely do their atoms oscUlate ?

    3°. Finally, under the action of what other vibrations may the molecular

 edifice be destroyed ?
     Ozone, and all bodies capable of uniting themselves with other bodies,

 would be simply molecules whose atoms are possessed of a vis viva sufficient
 to animate and set in motion the atoms of the other bodies with which

 they unite themselves.
     Will a simple hochj, even, always remain such to us, if it become possible

 to discover what oscillations have assembled the atoms of its constitutive
 molecule, and what can destroy it ?

    Such is the question which future lovers of nature and science may be one

 day enabled to solve.
     One word more, upon a probable conjecture.
     I have often seen that, under some circumstances not yet determined by me,

 the concentrated action of solar light is not without eff"ect upon atmospheric air.
 In such case an appreciable whitish-blue colour is produced ; might it not,
  then, be presumed that the fine whitish-blue vapour which in Alpine
 valleys bathes the foot of a mountain is produced by the action of a

 brightly luminous sky under favourable and unknown circumstances of heat,

 light, and aqueous vapour ?
ON FOSSILS OBTAINED AT KILTORKAN QUARRY.                                   73

On Fossils obtained at Kiltorkan Quarry, Co. Kilkenny.

       By Wm. Hellier Baily, F.L.S., F.G.S.

This celebrated fossil locality, in the Upper Old Eed Sandstone, is situated

between Kilkenny and Waterford, about six miles south of Thomastown and

a mile south-east of BaUyhalc, ou a ridge of Old-Red-Sandstone hills rising

gently from beneath the Carbonifcroiis Limestone plain to heights of from 400

to 500 feet above the sea-level, and sometimes to even 800 feet, as near the

boundary of the parishes of Derrynahinch and Jerpoint West.

This quarry has been visited from time to time by private individuals, by

the representatives of scientific societies in Dublin, and by the officers of the

Geological Survey of Ireland, on all which occasions it has furnished some

most interesting fossils, remarkable for their preservation and beauty, each

time yielding specimens either new to science or such as would assist in

elucidating those already collected.

At the meeting of this Association in N'orwich last year, I advocated the

importance of further excavations at this place, and applied for a grant of

.£40 towards that object ; £20 was, however, the only amount voted. I felt

some hesitation in accepting this sum in consequence of its insufficiency to

carry out the extent of excavation I had intended ; and had I not been aided

by the Geological Survey, it would have been comparatively useless to attempt

reopening this quarry with the sum placed at my disposal.

I did, however, proceed there last month, accompanied by an efficient and

zealous assistant, Mr. A. M'Henry, and pro\ided with tools, such as bars

Weand picks, for excavating with vigour.     were engaged for a fortnight,

working most laboriously ; and fortimately we had very favourable weather,

except that it was extremely hot in this exposed situation for the heavy

work we were occupied upon.

  We engaged the services of two men, who ably assisted in removing the

superficial soil and unproductive strata to the depth of about four or five feet,

which was carted away at once ; and we calculated that the total quantity

removed in this manner and excavated by us amounted to at least 200 loads

of stone and rubbish.

The character of the beds beneath this superficial covering, a fine-grained

greenish sandstone, admitted of great facility in working, splitting up into

layers, sometimes of large size ; occasionally, however, it is much cut up by

joints and small dislocations, which prevents its being worked so readily.

Some of the surfaces of these layers are covered by plant-remains ; and when

first opened the fossils are most beautifully exhibited, as, from the dampness

of the stone, their darker colour makes them appear very conspicuoiisly.

The following is an enumeration of the fossil plants observed :

Falceopteris Hihernica, originally named by Prof. Edward Forbes Cyclo-

pteris Hihernica, then referred to Acliantites by Brongniart, and now placed

by Prof. Schimper in his genus Falceopteris, the name signifying ancient fern,

in allusion to the antiquity of its type and its first appearance with the most

ancient terrestrial vegetables known, before the commencement of the Coal

period*, that celebrated author on fossil plants observing that it differs

from Cychpteris in the arrangement of its leaflets &c., and from Adiantides

(Adiantites) in its mode of fructification.

   Two other ferns have been collected from this place ; they are, however,
of less frequent occurrence. One of these has already been brought before

the notice of the members of this Association, and described by me as SpJte-

nopteris Hooheri; the other, an undescribed species, I propose to name

* Traits de Paleontologie V^getale &c., par W. Ph. Schimper. Paris, 1869.
--74 REPORT 1869.

Sjjlienopteris Himplu-esiana, after a gentleman (Mr. H. T. Humphreys) who

worked most indefatigably at this quarry, from which he obtained a large

collection of valuable specimens.

On our late visit we were fortunate eiiough to procure perhaps the finest

specimen extant oi Palceojyteris Hibernica, measuring about four feet in length,

with its base of attachment and fertile pinnules shown at the lower portion.

A few fragments  only  of Sjjhenopteris Hooherl were  collected                                      but we ob-
                                                                                                  ;

tained a finer example of ;S'. Uum])liresiana than any that had been before met

with, being a branch or stem with several alternating pinnules arranged upon it.

Large closely fluted stems, which I had formerly regarded as being iden-

tical with Sagenar'ia VeltJieimiana, and which, with others of a somewhat

similar character, Dr. Haughton has described under the name of Ci/clostif/ma,

are also of frequent occurrence at this quarry: one of these stems measured

six feet in length, with a diameter of six inches at its lower portion, and

even then its commencement or termination could not be ascertained ; the

upper portion of this plant having divergent branches, was considered to be

a distinct species, and referred to Lejndodendron minutum. Its fruit, of

which we obtained remarkably fine specimens, is a cone-like body, formed of

elongated scales, some of the detached ones showing very large and distinct

sporules at their base ; to these are appended long grass-hke or linear leaves

it is remarkable, as Dr. Schimper observes, from the fact that no other spe-

cies of Lepidodendron of which the fruits are known have such large sporules.

That gentleman, through whom we sent a small collection of these fossils

to the Museum d'Histoire Naturellc of Strasbourg, of which he is the Di-

rector, has done me the honour to name this remarkable plant after me, as

he considers it distinct from Sagenaria VeWieimiana, especially in the form

of the scales of the fruit, a part, which I had not the opportunity of exa-

mining in the latter species.
   Masses of roots with rootlets attached, such as I had observed in Mr.

Humphreys's collection, and which he assured me were connected with the

last-mentioned stem, were obtained by us from a bed which was permeated

by fossils of this character.
   The only example of moUusca found associated with these fossUs, and of

which we obtained good specimens, is the large bivalve named Anodonta

Julcesii by Prof. Edw. Forbes, after the Director of our Survey in Ireland,
whose loss, by death, we have had so lately to deplore. This shell is not
uufrequent, and is so closely allied to the recent Swan Muscle, Anodonta

cygncea, of oui- freshwater rivers, that it becomes a valuable auxiliary to-

wards the presunii)tion as to the freshwater origin of this deposit. It is,

however, amongst the class Crustacea, especially that of the Eurypteridaa
and Phyllopoda?, that the most important additions have been made to the
list of organic remains from this locality by our late visit.

   In one of the earhest collections of fossils made by the Geological Survey

at this place, a specimen was obtained, portion of a thoracic or body- segment,

ornamented with the peculiar scale-hke markings characteristic of these Crus-
tacea : this specimen was labelled by the late Mr. Salter Ewypterus ? Forhesii,

with a query as to the genus. In the Journal of the Geological Society, vol. xv.

p. 229, the same palaeontologist, in a paper on some species of Eurgpterus,
alludes to this specimen, which he figures as being probably identical with

Eurypierus'l Scoideri (RUshert), a, Coal-measure species from near Glasgow.

   "NYe have since met with other portions which favours the belief that this
specimen belongs to Pterygotus and not Eurypterus. Amongst the collection

iust made are two which appear to be heads, although they are not clearly
defined ; also a more definite but small example of the basal joint of a

swimming-foot (ector/nath) , showing very clearly the toothed edges of this
masticatory and locomotive organ, another specimen being apparently the
lower portion of a similar appendage. In a previous collection made by the
Geological Survey are specimens showing the pincers or chelas : in one of
these the ciu-ved points of both rami are preserved ; the upper one is seen to
be armed with two large tooth-like projections ; the lower one being imper-
fect does not show the corresponding parts.

   It is possible aU these fragments may belong to one species, -which I propose
to name Ptenjgotus Hlhernicus. Another and distinct crustacean is shown in

a well-marked head (or carapace), to which is attached portions of two of

the thoracic segments. This specimen I fortunately picked up amongst the
debris of the quarry immediately after visiting it. The form of this head,

with its central arched divisions, to which the eyes are attached, is not very

unlike that of a species of Belhmrus from the Coal-measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               it is also pro-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

vided with a border, and its posterior portion terminates on each side in a short

spine. I have provisionally named this species Belinurus ? Kiltorlccnsis.

Some detached body-segments, which were also procured at the same

time in the progress of excavation (one of the specimens showing two entire

segments, with portions of two others united), may possibly have belonged to

the above species.

In a former collection from this place made by the Geological Survey,

there arc three well-defined examples of the detached carapace of a shrimp-
like crustacean, which in shape approaches more nearly to that of the Silu-

rian than to any of the Carboniferous species, and most nearly to Hymeno-
caris of the Lingula-beds. The anterior margin is broad and produced,
giving it a curved outline, having a sinus running somewhat parallel and
near to it, which is marked near the centre by a small elongated depression

the surfaces of these fossils are covered by fine labyrinthine markings. One

of the fossils recently collected, although differing in shape (which may have

arisen from pressure), is probably a carapace of the same species, it being

also marked by a similar sculpturing. Some of the detached segments may

also belong to this species, which, from its peculiar prow-shaped carapace,

I propose to name Prorkaris MacEcnrici.

Of fish-remains wc were not successful in obtaining many examples on

this visit, a few detached scales only having been met with ; those formerly

collected are of great interest, and we had hoped to have met with specimens

which might have thrown a better light upon some before collected ; in this

we were disappointed, but do not despair if another opportunity offers for a

more extensive excavation. The fish-remains already obtained consist of

large conical teeth, resembling those of Dendrodus or Bot1inolej;ns, detached

scales, and a large portion of a fish which appears to be identical with Ghjp-

corresponding parts figured by Professor Agassiz in his Old-Eed-Sandstone fish.

There are also many detached smaller plates, and others with several plates
united, which may possibly belong to Pterichthys : as some of the latter are in
Prof. Huxley's hands, we may expect some valuable information about them.

"With respect to the disposal of the specimens, a large number of which

were collected, I would beg to suggest that the new species and those

required for working out details, should be retained for the Geological Survey's

collection in Ireland, and the duplicates distributed to such public insti-

tutions as it may be thought desirable to present them to.

In presenting the Eeport of the proceedings of the Lunar Committee re-

appointed at iSTor-ndch, it is desirable to refer as briefly as possible to the
progress of selenographical research during the entire existence of the

Committee. Since the Meeting of the British Association at Birmingham
four areas of the moon's surface, each of 5^ in extent both of longitude and
latitude, have been carefully and critically surveyed, not so much by the
determinations of positions (the means at the disposal of the Committee
being inadequate for instrumental and computative labour, which could only
be carried on in an establishment exclusively devoted to such an object, the
cost of which would far exceed the grants with which the Association has
aided the work) as in an examination of the physical aspects of 100 square
degrees of the moon's sm-face by means of the comparison and measurement
of photograms, combined with observation at the telescope, by several
observers in concert. Outlines of the objects thus siu-veyed have been laid
down on the orthographical projection on a scale of 200 inches to the moon's
diameter. The area thus survej-ed includes 443 objects ; a catalogue of
these objects has been prepared containing numerous selenographical and

selenological notices, those of the three areas completed previous to the re-
appointment of the Committee having appeared in the Appendices to the

Eeports of 1866 and ISGS.
    One of the principal objects which has been kept steadily in view is such

a description of lunar features that at any future time the similarity of the
description with the state of any particular crater, mountain, &c., or a depar-

ture therefrom, may be rcaddy ascertained. The great question of continued

lunar change, either transient or permanent, as contrasted with apparent
change dependent upon illuminating and visual angles, is one more likely for
posterity to settle. If, in geological science, a region undergoing a series of
changes (during the progress of which, through a long period of geological
time, lakes have been di'ained, volcanos have burst forth, extensive plateaus
of igneous ejections formed, and vast denudations of softer materials effected)
has retained its grander and more imposing features in their integrity, so in

selenological science we may look for small, and in many cases to us almost

inappreciable changes in and around weU-rccognized and imposing lunar
forms, than expect to witness the obliteration of some very striking object as
 an evidence of change. The following are extracts from the catalogue of

 the area completed during the past year.

    " The boundaries of Hipparchm differ materially from those of ordinary

 walled plains, and the cliffs on the S.W. are very unlike those of a circular

form, inclosing large circidar plains, as may be seen in the neighboiulng

 formation Ptolemaus. They present the appearance of having suffered
 erosion, the character of the S.W. side of these cliffs beiug remarkably
 different from the exteriors of large rings, craters, and plains. These

 features, combined with the gradations of level observable in the floors of
ON MAPPING THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.  11

E'tpparchus, IV A" ^i, and the Sinus Medii, tend to invest them with peculiar
interest. The apparent cutting away of the higher ground forming the E.

slope of Hind, the projection beyond the general line of cliffs of the N.E.

border of Ilallei/, the indentations of the cliffs N.W. of HaUet/ by the ravines

scoring the E. slope of Hind, the general integrity of the cliffs S.E. of Halley,
and the absence of similar indentations (these cliffs being cat through in one
instance by a fault and in another scored by an apparent lava-channel) are
phenomena which do not generally characterize wailed plains. It is extremely
difficidt in the present state of our knowledge even to conjecture the kind of
agencies which have operated in the production of a line of cliffs analogous in

many respects to a terrestrial coast-line. One thing, however, appears to be
certain, viz. the anterior existence of the E. slope of Hind as regards both

Hdlley and the line of cliffs, while the fault and lava-channel on the S.E. are
apparently more recent than the cliffs in which they occur."

   " Hind is situated just W. of the fault IV A" 23, IV A^ «3^ and occupies the
highest point of the mountain-range IV A"" ^. The slopes around it are of
very different characters. On the S.E., E., and N.E. the exterior slope is

grooved or farrowed with well-marked radiating valleys, while on the S.W.
and N. the slope is uninterrupted and destitute of any radiating markings.
The more recent production of Hind, as compared with the fault on the E., is
indicated by the vaUeys on its flank cutting through the fault. The posteri-
ority of the formation of HalUy, as well as the prodiiction of the depression

IV A"" 21 and the low floor of Hipparclius, is strongly suggested by the land

on which the grooved valleys occur being penetrated by Halley on the one

hand, and abruptly terminated on the other by the depression IV A'' 21 and
the valley IV A" " on the S.E., and the chff IV A" i" forming the S.W.

border of Hipparchus on the jST.E. The remarkable smoothness of the floor of

Hipparchus in close proximity- with the cliffs is very significant."

    " The slope of Hind on the S.E., E., and N.E., with its valley-like furrows
and interrupted continuity by Halley, and the cliffs on the S.W. of Hippar-
chus before mentioned, may be advantageously compared with the crater
Aristillus on the Palus Nehularum, which to all appearance now exists in its
primeval state surrounded by its furrowed flanks, extending far on the
surfaces both of the Palus Nehularum and the Palus Putredinis. Only a
small portion of the flank of Hind remains, the outer portions having been

cut off by the more recent formations. It is not a little remarkable that the

cliff IV A'' i*' should be so distinct and precipitous in the neighbourhood of a
crater partly surrounded by the remnant of a furrowed slope ; and it is

difficult to conceive with such phenomena, that ejecta from a volcano such as

Hind appears to be, should extend no further than so precipitous a cliff as the
S.W. border of Hipparchus. The order of production appears to be as

--follows : the fault on the ray from Tycho, Hind, Hcdley. It is probable

that the production of the floor of Hipparchus occui'red at a stiU later epoch.

* * * The highest portion of the region in which Hind and Hcdley have
been opened bears some resemblance to the granitic plateau of central

France."

   A" very strong indication of the protrusion of Hcdley, subsequent to the

formation of the valley IV A^ 27, ly ^"j 17, and IV A*^ ^^, sui^posing the throe
portions were once connected, is afforded by the valley being completely

blocked on the JST.N.E. and S.S.W. by the E.S.E. rim of Hcdley. Mr. Ingall,

on June 26, 1866, pointed out to me the connexion of the valleys N.N.E. and

S.S.W. of Hcdley. At first sight this connexion might appear to be in
direction only. The valley IV Ai 27 ig certainly closed, as appears on the

photograms, at the S.W. end by the angle formed by the N.E. border of

MHaJley. The posteriority of the epoch of the valley IV 2?, lY A" ", and

IV A*^ 13 to that of Hind is strongly indicated by the continuity of the S.E.

slope of Hind being interrupted by the valley, much in the same way as the

WeN.E. is by the cliff IV A'' ^^.          may trace here with great probabUity the

following sequences of formations :--1°, that of the highland IV A'' ^ ; 2", the

fault  IV  A"  23,  lY   A.^  62           30^ the protrusion of Hind ;     4°, the formation of
                                        .

the valley IV Ai ^7, IV A'' ^'^, IV A** ^^ (several valleys hereabout are nearly

parallel  with  this) ;  5°,  the          formation  of the  IVcliff  A''  ^^ ;  G°,  the  protrusion

of HcdUij ; and 7°, the cleft or wall on the E. of IV A'' 2, which is the highest

in the locality."

"The exactitude of direction of certain lines of valleys and mountains on

opposite sides of HijypcircJms indicate a more recent epoch for the formation

of the floor of Hijyparclius than for the production of the valleys and moun-

tains on the lines specified. In connexion ·with these circumstances the

following questions suggest themselves. Docs the general parallelism of the

lines of mountains and valleys in the neighbourhood of Hipjyarchus point to

contemporaneity of origin? Has the present floor of Hipparclius resulted

from a subsidence, by which the former surface was depressed below the

surrounding levels? There are some indications that, prior to the production

of the fault IV A" ", IV A^ -^, IV" "'-, the sm-faces E. and W. of it were at
the same level. Was this the level at which the valleys and mountains

above alluded to were continuous ? and has the sui'face between them, as well

as the floor of Hipparclms, generally become depressed below its former

level? If so, it would appear that Horrox was opened upon this former

irregular surface ; and it may be interesting to inquire further as to what

may have become of the portions of the mountains and valleys which have

disappeared. This question may be very difficult to answer, especially in

the very imperfect state of our selenographical knowledge."

" There is some reason to believe that Horrox was not the only crater

opened on this part of Hipparclms previous to the supposed epoch of de-

Mpression. The curved mountain-chain IV ^s presents all the characters of

an ancient and nearly filled crater, slightly exceeding Horrox in size. Nearly

half the ring is left, two craterlets are opened in the line of wall, and the

surface which is traversed by a cleft is slightly depressed below the level of

the surrounding floor of Hipparclms. It is one of those instances which

AVebb, in his paper on the Moon (Frasei''s Magazine, Sept. 1868), refers to

' of cavities in proximity to the grey plains having interiors so flat, so grey,

so identical in appearance and level with the plain, that hardly a doubt

remains of their having been subsequently filled iip by intrusive matter of

Mthe same origin and under the same pressure as that around them.' If

lY 5^ be a nearly submerged crater, and the lines of mountains and valleys

on opposite sides of Hipparclms were once continuous, the intermediate

--portions having also been submerged, the question to be resolved is Whence

came the material which has effected the submergence ? The whole of the

floor of Hipp>arclms, as compared with the surrounding formations, strongly

exhibits indications of change of level ; it is comparatively smooth, and of

different reflective powers. The most striking difterence of level occurs near
the cliff IV A" i« and the mountains IV A^ -^ and IV A^ -t?. Does this at all

point to a subsidence of the floor of llipparchus, accompanied by an invasion

of intrusive matter ? Instances of subsidence may be found on the moon';
Strain/Id ivcdl may be quoted, the surface on the E. being at a lower level

(about 1000 feet) than that on the W. The j)lain of Dionysius (Eeport Brit.
ON MAPPING THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.  79

Assoc. 1865, p. 304) appears to be a depressed surface S. of the cleft of

Ariadaus, the N. side being at a higher level. In like manner a portion of
the surface N.E. of the line of chffs ivom. Ptohmceus to Bitter andL. Sabine va^j
have subsided and produced the depressed region known as Hipparclius."

    " While areas of depression, if not of subsidence, can be traced on the
surface of the moon, and also the presence of a material which has invaded

such regions and in many instances nearly buried preexisting craters and

other objects, it is not so easy to ascertain whence this material came ; still
closer scrutiny is indispensable to throw further light upon it."

   " In numerous portions of the moon's surface, as on that of the earth, we

--behold the results of the operation of two opposing forces, one by which the

features are moulded and, as it were, built up, imparting to the objects so
produced an aspect of freshness that it is impossible to question their com-
parative recent production ; the other by which objects once possessing all

the characteristics of a recent formation have yielded, it may have been
gradually, to surrounding influences, whatever they may have been, so that

at the present time they exhibit the semblance of vast ruins, which in some
localities are unrelieved by even the slightest indication of the operation of a
force of an opposite character."

   " Webb, in his very masterly paper on the Moon, in ' Eraser's Magazine ' for
September 1868, speaks of the possibility that the colossal lunar formations
may have been the result of forces acting in a more gradual manner and
with less temporary vehemence than may seem to comport with the term
explosion. It may be that astronomers may have paid much more attention
to those lunar features which are clearly the results of explosive action than

to those which manifest the presence of a degrading agency. It has been

considered that many of the larger forms have been produced by rapid,
violent, and tumultuary processes ; and, however true this view may be, it

is certainly inadeqiiate to account for the present appearances of still larger

tracts in which no explosive outburst of an epoch which may in any sense

be called recent occurs. Nearly filled as well as broken rings, interrupted
mountain-chains, and comparatively smooth tracts without any weU-defined

boundaries are characteristic of such regions ; and it may be asked in what

manner and by what agency have they attained their present condition?
Has the ' erosion ' of Chacornac destroyed the missing portions of the broken
rings ? and has this 'erosion' acted suddenly or gradually'l Has the 'diluvial,'

restricted by Webb to the expression of comparative fluidity, independent of

the nature of the material, invaded and nearly fiUed previously deep craters,
so as to furnish a connected series of well-known forms, from the smooth,

floored, waUed plain to the just perceptible ring above the surface? Has

this same ' dUuvial ' buried the lower i^ortions and the lateral spurs of

continuous mountain-chains, so that now the higher portions alone remain
as short and detached ranges in the original line ? One cannot help con-

trasting the continental region, to use a terrestrial analogy, in which this

area IV A*" occurs, with the magnificent chains of the Apennines and Hcemus,
and the lower and smooth levels of the 2Iare Imhrium and Mare Serenitatis,
as exhibiting in a very marked degree the results of the forces already men-
tioned. In the latter we see the effects of comparative recent action in the

production of vast mountain-chains and the neighbouring extensive level
plains. In the former these grand features are wanting; the surface,
although far from being smooth as that of the Maria, is roughened only with
the remains of former mountains, rings, and craters ; the degrading agency,

whatever it may have been, appears to have operated almost unchecked in
80 REPORT-- 1869.

this region, and it is a subject of interesting inquiry as to how this state of
things has been effected. Has the filling up, has the wearing down, if such

is the case, been gradual? and what forces have been concerned in producing

the mutilated forms we now observe ? "
   " Brightness and colour may ultimately become keys by means of which a

better acquaintance may be obtained with the chronological sequence of lunar

formations. Chacornac refers the great continental formations to an epoch
anterior to that of the production of the great plains, this, again, being anterior
to the period of explosive energy, contributing to the existence of numerous
objects, such as bowl-shaped craters and smaller blow-holes, within the
interior of which no intrusive matter is found. Reference, however, is not
prominently made to objects in mountainous regions similar to those which

we find in various portions of the great plains, viz. partly buried craters and
partially destroyed rings, of which we have evidence in this and adjoining

areas to the "W". The contrast of the general coloitr of the surface hereabout,
as compared with that of the grey plains, its mottled and rugged aspect,
arising probably from its altered character from that which it possessed at
a still earlier epoch, the absence of that sharpness of outhne in its remaining
mountain-peaks or ranges so characteristic of those which we find nearer to
and often on the grey plains, together testify to a much earlier epoch than
even that of the production of the partly filled rings on the grey plains.
Bright, white, glistening surfaces, more or less in the neighbourhood of
bowl-shaped craters,'and dark patches of deep grey approaching black, appear

--alike to indicate the most recent formations the first, it may be, from loose

fragmentary incoherent materials ejected from adjacent craters ; the last
from substances in a state at least of comparative fluidity, which have escaped
from the interior reservoii's at the times of eruption. Phillips compares the
bright glistening region o{ Aristarchits to one in which tvhife trachyte abounds

and many of the basalts in terrestrial volcanic regions present a dark colour.

Between the brightest and darkest of such limited areas on the moon's surface
every gradation of intermediate tint occurs ; and from a careful consideration
of the physical aspect of those regions which, on the one hand, reflect con-
siderably less light than the brighter, and on the other considerably more

than the darker, it may be inferred that such regions are amongst the most

ancient of lunar formations."

  A very ancient formation has been traced on area IV A"", the earliest state

of which is considered to have been very similar to many of the more recent

districts, such as those in which perfect craters and mountainous regions
intermingle. The first change which appears to have taken place on this
formation is that of the production of a grey plain, traces of which still exist.
The material of this plain appears to have invaded certain craters, breaking
down the walls of those immediately facing the plain, and partially filling
others. The next change appears to have been of an elevatory character,
the evidences consisting of a line of low mountains which has in a great
measure obhterated the characteristics of a grey plain and introduced those
more in accordance -with an ancient district, which are strikingly in contrast
with the features of the more recent craters to the E. The only instance of
volcanic outburst on this ancient district consists of a chain of craterlets of

quite an insignificant character.
   The determination of the successive changes before alluded to rests on the

strong indications, afforded by the careful study of photograms, of the priority
and posteriority of weU-marked features, which can only be realized by

contemplating the lunar picture in the seclusion of the study. "While the
ON MAPPING THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.                    81

telescopic view is far superior to the photographic, the continual changes of
illuminating and visual angle prevent that appreciation of the relations of

different features to certain epochs of production which can be so well studied
in the photogram ; the detail thus seized upon by the aid of photography is

vividly realized by the eye at the telescope when the surface of the moon is

suitably illuminated.

   While engaged upon area IV A"" I have met with a remarkable instance of
difference between De La Rue's photogram, Eeb. 22, 1858, and Rutherford's,
March 6, 1865. Lohrmann figures a jjlain, bounded on the AV. by a moun-

tain-chain on which he gives a little crater, which he numbers 51. In

De La Rue's photogram the crater, which appears to be shallow, is exactly in

the position given by Lohrmann. Hot a vestige of this crater is to be discerned
on RuiherfordJs 2->liotogram seven years later ! Both photograms are under

nearly the same illumination.
   I have also met with a few instances of apparent variations of tint and

brightness. The floor of the crater Hind, on the S. W. of Hipparchus, appears

to have undergone a variability of tint during a period of eleven years
according to the following numbers :

1858-14=5°-9,           1865-18=7°-0,  1868-98 = 3°-6

The slopes of two valleys, lY A*" ^ and IV A"" ii, which cut through the

S.W. border of Hipparchus, manifest different degrees of brilliancy on the

two photograms. They are much brighter on Rutherford's than on De La

Rue's photogram, and IV A"* ^ appears to have become brighter in a greater

degree than IV A"" i^.

Report of the Committee on the Chemical Nature of Cast Iron. The
    Committee consists o/F. A. Abel, F.R.S., D. Yorbes, F.R.S., and A.
    Matthiessen, F.R.S.

The Committee have to report that, during the past year, some material
progress has heen made in this research. They entrusted the preparation
of the pure iron to Mr. Matthiesscn, who carried out this part of the inves-
tigation in conjunction with Mr. Prus Szczepanowski. From a series of ex-

periments, which are detailed in the Appendix, pure iron appears to be ob-

tainable in considerable quantities, and wo hope, if the Committee be re-

appointed, that next year a great deal of valuable information will be obtained
on the chemical nature and physical properties of pure iron and its alloys.

The iron obtained by the process described in the Appendix is almost abso-
lutely pure, containing only a minute trace of sulphur. According to an
analysis made by Prof. Abel, the iron contained, in a hundred parts, only
0-00025 part of sulphur. In another analysis, the amount of sulphur found
by Mr. Prus Szczepanowski amounted to 0-0007 per cent.* Phosphorus and
silicon were carefully tested for by both analysts, and found to be entirely

 absent.

    "With regard to the physical properties of pure iron, owing to the -want of
time, nothing as yet has been accm-ately determined. It appears, however,

that many of the physical properties of the pure metal differ considerably

from those of the commercial.

On the Preparation of Pv/re Iron. By A. Matthxessen, F.R.S. , and S. Pktts

                                                    Szczepanowski.

    After numerous trials, the general outline of which was given in the
lleport of last year, the following method was found to yield nearly abso-

lutely pure iron, in quantities sufficient for the purpose of this research.
 Pure dried ferrous sulphate and piire dried sodium sulphate are mixed in
nearly equal proportions, and introduced gradually into a red-hot platinum

 crucible. The mass is kept in fusion until the evolution of sulphurous acid
gas ceases. The crucible is then allowed to cool, and the fused mass ex-
tracted with water. If the heat be properly regulated, the whole of the
iron is left as a very fine crystalline oxide. This oxide is thoroughly washed
by decantation to remove every trace of the sodium sulphate, and, after
being dried, is reduced by hydrogen in a platinum crucible ; the spongj'^ iron
thus obtained is then pressed into solid buttons and melted in lime crucibles

Avith the oxyhydrogen-blowpipe.
    Before proceeding further, it will be as well to mention the precautions

observed in obtaining the raw material in the purest state. The commer-
cial pure ferrous sulphate was freed from every trace of copper by leading

sulphuretted hydrogen through the warm acetic acid solution. After filtra-

tion, the ferrous sulphate was twice recrystallizcd and dried, first in a water-
bath, then in an air-bath. The commercial crystallized sodium sulphate was

recrystallizcd several times to get rid of the last traces of chloride of sodium,

 and then heated on a water-bath to melt the crystals. As is well known,
anhydrous sodium svdphate separates out from this solution, which was
scooped out from time to time, dried on an air-bath, and powdered. The
 purification of the sodium sulphate from chloride of sodium was found to be
necessary, owing to the fact that, when fusions were made with sodium sul-

           * The amount of substance taken for eacli analysis was about 30 grammes.
ON THE CHEMICAL NATURE Or CAST IRON.  83

phate containing that salt, the resulting oxide of iron always contained
jjlatiuum. The hjalrogen used for the reduction of the iron, as well as for
the blowpipe, was prepared by the action of sulphuric acid on zinc, and
purified by leading the gas through two wash-bottles, the first containing
nitrate of silver and strong nitric acid, and the second caustic soda and
acetate of lead, both bottles being half filled with pieces of puniicestone.

The oxygen was prepared by heating a mixture of chlorate of potassium
with 15-20 per cent, of black oxide of manganese, and washed by leading
tkrough caustic soda. All wash-bottle &c. connexions were made of glass,

lead, or pure india-rubber tubing.

   The fusion took place in a large platinum crucible (the contents of which
was rather more than half a litre) , enclosed in the usual manner in a clay
crucible. The dimensions were such that about a kilogramme and a half
of the mixture could be fused at each operation. After fusion the crucible
is allowed to cool, it is then boiled out with distilled water, and the accu-
mulated product of 6-8 fusions washed by decautation with boiling distilled
water. The crystalline oxide settles very quickly, and thus allows of a very
rapid and thorough washing. The washing was in every case continued
several times after the wash-waters ceased to give any turbidity Avith
barium nitrate*. The reduction of the oxide thus formed was made in a
covered platinum crucible, heated by means of a large Bunsen burner. The
hydrogen was introduced by means of a platinum-tube, reaching through
the cover to the bottom of the crucible. The gas, purified as described above
and dried by chloride of calcium, was always kept slightly in excess, a con-
stant stream of gas being obtained by not using a generator, but two large
gas-holders joined together, the contents of each being about 600 litres (20
cubic feet), two other gas-holders of similar capacity being used for the
storage of the oxygen, the one being used to coUect the gas from the retort,

the other to contain the gas purified by passing through a strong solution of

caustic soda.

   The resulting spongy iroii was pressed into solid buttons by means of a
strong coining-press and a diamond mortar, the cylinder of which being
about 70 millimetres in height ; the iron, when pressed, forms a cylinder of
about 15 millimetres in height, and weighs about 20 grammes. The melt-
ing of the compressed iron took place in lime-crucibles, the lime having been
previously burnt, slacked, and reburnt, thus forming a fine impalpable pow-
der, which was compressed in the crucible mould.

 --The best method of fusion was found to be as follows : The lime-crucible

was placed in a slanting position on a piece of lime. One of the oxyhydro-
gen-blowpipes, used in the process, played on the outside of the crucible

whilst the flame of the other was directed inside. When white-hot, a cylin-

der of the compressed iron was thrown into it. It quickly melts, but at the
expense of a large quantity of the iron which is oxidized. The amount losfe
by oxidation varies between 25 and 50 per cent. In order to obtain a goodi
solid button of melted iron, it is necessary to cool it in an atmosphere of
hydrogen, which is easily obtained, simply by turning off the oxygen from
the blowpipe playing inside the crucible. The button thus obtained weighs

about 15 grammes. On analysis, it was found that these buttons were free

from phosphorus, silicon, and calcium, but contained a minute trace of sulphur.

Report of the Committee appointed to explore the Marine Fauna and

 --Flora of the South Coast of Devon and Cormvall. No. 3. Consist-

   ing of Spence Bate, F.R.S., T. Cornish, Jonathan Couch, F.L.S.,

   J. GwYN Jeffreys, F.R.S., and J. Brooking Rowe, F.L.S. Re-

   po7'ter, C. Spence Bate.

In presenting to the Association the Third Report on the Fauna and Flora of
the Southern Coast of Devon and Cornwall, I have to state that, independently
of endeavouring to obtain a complete registration of all the more rare forms
of life that exist upon the coast-line within dredging distance of the shore,
the Committee have, as far as practicable, endeavoured to, obtain information
relative to the development, growth, and habits of those animals of which
our knowledge has hitherto been imperfect.

                                                          Cetacea.

    I think it desirable to put on record the Cetacea that have been taken
within the last few years on the coast, specimens of most of which are pre-

served in the Museum of the Plymouth Institution.

Delphinus delplds. Dolphin.

   Occasionally in the Channel : the last, January 1864. From the immense
mass of fat underlying the skin, and from some unknown reason causing the
skin to shrink, it was found impossible to preserve it.

D. tursio. Bottlenoso Dolphin.

   No record of any since the one described by Montagu in 1814.

Phoccena communis. Porpoise.

   Common.

P. orca. Grampus,

   Occasionally in the Channel. In Mr. Ross's collection, now in the Exeter
Museum, I believe, was a young one driven on shore at Exmouth in 1844.
The specimen in the Museum of the Plymouth Institution has been taken since.

P. melas. Round-headed Porpoise.
    One captured off Plymouth in April 1839, and towed into the harbour.

Pliyseter macroceplialus. Spermaceti Whale.
    One is stated by Bellamy to have been thrown on shore near Plymouth

many years since.

Bcdmnoptera hoops.

   This species has occurred several times. One in 1831 (the specimen now
in the British Museum) was tound lloating oif the Eddystone ; a second

was captured in a herring-net in Torbay, in 184G. In 1803 one was ob-
tained off Plymouth, and the skeleton was purchased by the Alexandra Park
Company, and is now, I suppose, at Muswell Hill,
Beluga alhicmis.

   Mr. P. H. Gosse writes :--" On August 6th, 1832, I was returning from

Newfoundland to England, and was sailing up! the British Channel close
to the land, when just off Berry Head I saw under the ship's bows a large
       MARINE TAUNA AND FLORA OF SOUTH DEVON AND CORNWALL. 85

Cetacean of a inilky--white hue, but appearing slightly tinged with green
from the intervening stratum of clear water. It was about 16 feet long, M'ith

a round bluff head. It continued to swim along before the Tcssel's head, a
few yards beneath the surface, for about ten minutes, maintaining our rate
of speed, which was five knots an hour, all which time I enjoyed from the
bowsprit a very good view of it. It could have been no other than the "White
Whale, the B. borealis of Lesson."

    It frequently occurs on the Scottish coast.

                                                               Pish.

    Of the Fish there have been but few novelties that I can add to the pre-
vious lists. The most interesting specimens are those of a Double-spined
Ray and a variety of the Short-finned Tunny ; the former is preserved in

the Museum of the Plymouth Institution, and the latter in that of the

Natural-History Society of Penzance. The Ilay was taken off' Plymouth, and
appears to coincide nearly with that of Eaia aquila (L.), except in being
very much larger, and in the presence of two spines.

    One point of interest that belongs to this specimen is the relation that it

--bears to li. uttavella (L.). Of this Mr. J. Couch says : " Consulting Artedi,

and after him Linnajus, and comparing them with Lacepede, I find generally,
as characters common to R. aquila and H. attavella, the body smooth and a
slender tail. Linnaeus says R. attavella has two spines often ; but Lacepede
makes the same remark of JR. aquila. The material difference is that R.
aquilti has a very long tail, while attavella has it even less than the length
of half the body. According to Lacepede (who says nothing of a Short-
tailed Eagle Ray), the pectorals of his aquila are gradually slender, like the
wing of an Eagle ; but Artedi says that in attavella the pectorals are broad."

    The dimensions of the recent specimen are 2 ft. 4 in. across the fins, 1 ft.
10 in. from the snout to the base of the spines, and 2 ft. 10 from the

snout to the extremity of the tail; while those of R. aquila, in the Mu-

seum of the Plymouth Institution, are 14 in. across the fins, 11| in. to the
base of spines, and 2 ft. 1 in. from the snout to the extremity of the tail.

    Of the Tunny (Thynnus hracliypterus), or Short-finned Tunny, Mr. Thomas
Cornish of Penzance says that the specimen that he captured in Mount's Ray
differs from that given, both in figure and letterpress, vol. iv. Appendix, by
Mr. Couch, in his work on Rritish Fishes, in having " more fin-rays in the

first dorsal than my specimen had, and does not show two free soft fin-rays
between the first and second dorsals, which were conspicuous in my fish."

                                                             CEtrSTACEA.

   I am not aware that there are any novel forms or species to be recorded

as the result of the dredging-operations of the Committee since the last
reported list of Crustacea. In fact, the Committee have thought that they
would be doing more to advance our knowledge of this class of animals,

in pursuing the life-history of those that are already known to us, than by

searching for the few stray specimens that have not hitherto been described

as inhabitants of these seas.

   Mr. Cornish informs me that he has very recently obtained in Mount's

Bay several specimens of Polybius Henslowii.

Stenorynchus plialangium.

   The young of Stenorynchus is a true Zoe, but diff'ers from the typical form
in the absence of the great rostral spine, and in the increased length of the
great dorsal spine, by a series of latero-dorsal spines on the three posterior
--86 REPORT 1869.

somites of the pleon, and in the enormous development of two deciduous spines
on the base of second pair of antennce.

Homarus marlnus.

Common as the European Lobster is, it is very remarkable that a very young

si)eeimen has, as far as I know, never been met with. I have for several years

offered a reward for a very small specimen, but have never received one less

than 3 inches long from the rostrum to the telsou. Many years since Erdl,
in a memoir on the subject, described the young Homarus as being hatched

in the form of the adult animal.

T have, during the last two summers that I have been engaged on this

Eeport, endeavoured to hatch and develope this among other forms. Having

specimens  brought  to  me  with  ova,  I have  succeeded  in  hatching the  same
                                                                                                    ;

but the mystery connected with the preservation of life, so as to enable us to

watch the development of the animal from one stage to the next, has yet to

be overcome.

Thi'ough the kindness of Mr. Alford Lloyd, curator of the aquarium in the

Zoological Gardens at Hamburg, I have been enabled to obtain a specimen

hatched under his knowledge about eight days old. This enables me to

prove that not only is the young liatchcd in a form distinct from that of the

parent, but, while it has continued to increase in size, and therefore cast more

than a single moult, that it retains that form for some time after its birth.

The ovum is about one-tenth of an inch in diameter, and contains a vitellus of

a dark, almost black, green colour'. In the earlier stages of the develop-

ment of the embryo, the central or deciduous eye is distinctly seen, but

appears to be lost at the time of the escape of the larva from the egg-case ;
at this period the young animal has a short pointed rostrum, that at first is

bent back under the ventral surface of the ccphalon ; two large eyes, which

at first are bent under the lateral margin of the cephalou ; two pairs of short
antenna ; a non-appeudiculated mandible ; two pairs of maxillae, the third

pair or maxilliped being not yet developed ; seven pairs of pereiopoda, each of
which carries attached to the third joint a long secondary multiarticulated

ramus. The third pair is developed into a strong chelate organ, whilst the

fourth and fifth pairs have rudimentary processes attached to the distal

extremity of the fifth joint that demonstrates their chelate conditions at a

very early stage. The pleon consists of six somites only, neither of which is

furnished with a pair of appendages, or, as far as I could see, the rudiments

of them. The posterior somite or telson is dorsally and veutrally flattened,

evenly excavate at the posterior margin, which has the lateral extremities

produced to a shai'p point ; while a large strong spine projects posteriorly

from the centre, on each side of which, between it and the lateral point, are

about twelve short stout pointed hairs.

Crangon vulgaris.

   The young of the common Shrimp, although I have read of its resemblance
to that of A. mysis, has not, I am convinced from that description, ever been
described from the form in which it appears at the period when it leaves the

egg- case.

   At this stage it has a long straight anteriorly projecting rostrum on the
carapace, a posteriorly projecting dorsal spine on the third somite of the
pleon, and a lateral one on the posterior margin on each side of the fifth
somite. The eyes are large, the antenna3 short ; the mandibles and two

pairs of maxillae, as well as the three anterior pairs of pereiopoda, are alone

developed, of which the three last are furnished with secondary appen-

dages : at a later stage in the develojiineut the posterior pairs of pereiopoda
are developed with secondary appendages like the Lobster in its primary

stage. At this time the resemblance to some of the Mijsidce is so great that
it is highly probable that some of those Mysidce that are distinguished by

the development of their appendages in the form of true legs may he only

the young of the several species of Crangon.

Pcdcemon.

   The larva of the common Prawn differs but little from that of the Shrimp
in the early stages of its development. The chief points of distinction arc
only such as could be called specific, and not improbably may be found in the
young condition of the larva of various species in either genus. They chiefiy

exist in Palcemon, having a longer rostral spine and a dorsal spine being pre-
sent on the posterior margin of the fifth somite of the pleon.

   It would be interesting, should we have the opportunity, to compare the
larva of the enormous freshwater Prawn of Guatemala, a crustacean as large

as a half-grown Lobster, with that of our European species.

Palinurus mannus.

   In my last Report are given figures of the young of the genus Palinu-

rus, an animal that has excited considerable attention amongst carcinologists
in consequence of its near resemblance to the form of Phyllosoma, a circum-

stance that has induced many zoologists to believe that they arc but the same

animal in different stages of growth. Since the presentation of the second
Report, in which I gave certain reasons for not too readily accejiting this con-

clusion, Dr. Anton Dohrn has given much time to the subject, and traced the
development of the ovum from the commencement to the period when the

--j-oung animal quits the egg-case. He writes to me from Messina, February

1869 : " I only assure you that the thing is finished. The Phylhsoma are
the larva3 of the Loricatcv. I have followed the development of Scylhirus and

Palinurus eggs, and both have brought out Phylhsoma. What is there so

anomalous in Phyllosoma ? It is nothing but a depressed Megalops. ... I have
followed the development of the interior organization as well, and there is no
dift'ercnce of real value between Phyllosoma and Scyllarus, or Palimirus."

   This, which gives the author such confidence, is nothing more than has
been known for the last twenty years. The question is not as to the forms of
the larva of Palinurus, Scyllarus, &c., but whether certain animals that are
like them, but five hundred times as large, that we find mostly in exotic seas,
are the same but a little older specimens. If they arc, as Dr. Dohrn and
other naturalists afiirm, then they establish the remarkable fact that the larva3
of these Crustacea grow from the one-tenth of an inch in length to that of
one or two inches in length, without any material variation of form, a
feature that is not consistent with the life-history of the development of the

animals of this class.

   If we examine the progressive growth of other Crustaceans, we find that

with every increase in growth there is a fresh moult, and every moult de-
velopes the animal a stage nearer the tyjie of the adult animal. If the
Phyllosoma be, as contended, the young of Palinurus, then an arrest in pro-
gressive development takes place, while that of growth continues.

   An argument in favour of this being the case (that Phyllosoma may be the
young of Palinurus) may be found in a species described by De Haan in

Siebold's ' Fauna Japonica ' under the name of Ph. Guerinii, in which an
intermediate progressive step exists, inasmuch as the carapace is developed

so far posteriorly as to cover the pereion.
88 EEPORT--1869.

   I think, therefore, that although step hy step we may arrive at the true

knowledge, yet the large amount of negative evidence, which is capable at
any day of being overthrown, must make us hesitate in accepting as a thing
proved the statement that Phyllosoma and the closely resembling larvae of
Palinurus are one and the same creature.

   The genus ScyUarus has now been so frequently captured on our coast,
that we must consider it not as a mere straggler, but as an old inhabitant of

--the British seas.
   Mr. Cornish writes : " Some years since I suggested to Prof. Bell, with
the first specimen that I took, that it was identical with the little lobster
described by Borlase (Nat. Hist. p. 274) as ' that fine Shrimp (Squilla lata,
Bondeletii) I found in Careg-KiUas, in Mount's Bay;' but he thought that
Squilla lata was the other ScyUarus, and not mine. I now beheve that I
was right and he was wrong. Looking at the rarity of the species in Mount's
Bay, it is more probable that Borlase's specimen and mine should be the
same species, than that they should be distinct."

   Borlase took his on Careg-Killas, in Mount's Bay. This name is lost ; but
it means " slate," or " killas-rock," and it was (fzc^e Borlase, Nat. Hist. p. 254)
" a ledge where loose stones could be turned over," near Penzance (p. 206).

    There are but two places in Mount's Bay which satisfy this description,
and the one nearest to the Doctor's residence is Long Rock, where the latest
specimen of ScyUarus was taken.

    Besides which. Pennant (vol. iv. p. 17, No. 23, Lobster) speaks of Squilla
lata, Eondeletii, as the size of the S^iny Lobster. Dr. Borlase speaks of his
specimen as " that fine shrimp."

    The specimen of which Mr. Cornish writes was captured alive, and, being
in fuU spawn, was sent on to me, with the hope that, should it arrive alive,
I might be able to hatch the ova, and so make out the hitherto undetermined
form of the young ScyUarus. Unfortunately the animal was dead when it

reached me that same evening. The ova were very abundant in quantity,

each being about ^^ of an inch in diameter, with an orange-coloured vitellus.
The embryo was in a very immature stage, so that little could be learned

Myfrom it as to the form or character of the larva when it quits the ovum.

friend Dr. Andrew Dohrn, however, Avho has on the coast of Sicily been
giving his attention to this subject amongst others, informs me that the larva

 of ScyUarus is identical with that of Palinurus, and consequently assumes the

form of Phyllosoma,

 Squilla.

     Several specimens of this genus have been recorded from the coasts of
 Devon and Cornwall ; but the scarcity of their appearance induces us to
 consider them rather as stragglers drifted from the Channel Islands than

 inhabitants of our southern shores. Two other genera of closely allied

 animals are occasionally taken in the same locality. These have been de-
 scribed by Prof. Milne-Edwards, and figured under the respective names of
 Alima and Squillerichihys ; specimens of both these have been taken during

 the last summer, the former by Mr. Hay Lankester, and the latter by Mrs.
 Collings of Serk. The former of these animals has much in its appearance
 that is suggestive of an undeveloped condition ; but it was difficult to define
 the parent stock ; it might be a young Squillerichtliys, or it might be a young

 Squilla, from either of which it differs in having but two flageUa to the
 anterior appendage, and in the absence of the five pairs of pereiopoda ; while
 in Squilla and SquillerichtJiys there are three flagella to the anterior antenna3,
 and all the pereiopoda are present. The general form, however, of Alima is
MARINE I'AUNA AXD FLORA OF SOUTH DEVON AND CORNWALL. 89

nearer to Squilleyichthys than is Squillerichthys to Sqidlla. This separation
appears to receive a wider demarcation from the circumstance that Mrs.
Collings took attached to her specimen several small ova ; two of these, Avith

the specimen, she kindly forwarded to me for inspection. These, however,

after due consideration, I came to the conclusion were only accidentally
entangled, or else deposited by some parasitic animal, since they were at-
tached to a large flexile membrane diftering essentially from those that cover
the ova of Crustacea generally.

    Fortunately, however. Dr. Power, while staying in the Mauritius, hatched

and forwarded to me a considerable number of the young of different Crus-

tacea; among these were those of a Squilla. This, although the young of
an exotic species, bears so close a relation to the genus Alima of Milne-
Edwards, that we can have no hesitation in accepting them as different stages
in the growth of animals of the same genus.

    So with Squillerichth)/s, the features that distinguish it from Squilla being
clearly expressed in the larva of Squilla, and repeated in the form of Alima
in a condition that is a modification between it and Squillerichthys, conduces
to the conviction that, like Alima, Squillerichthys is but a stage in the de-

velopment oi Squilla, a circumstance that enables us with much confidence to

unite the three supposed genera as different stages in the progressive de-
velopment of one and the same genus.

    In the entrance to the channel, during the present spring, largo quantities

of the Crustacea named by Prof. Bell, in his ' Histoiy of the British Crus-
tacea,' Thysanopoda Couchii, were taken in the stomachs of fish; of these a
considerable number were sent to me by Mr. Loughrin, but they were not in a
condition favourable for examination. The pendulous ovipouch, that affords
such a peculiar feature to the animal, was generally of a bright orange-colour
but, generally speaking, the contents had been so acted upon by tho digestive
juices that little was determinable from them. This I think we may speak

with certainty, that they are not of the genus Thysanopoda.

from the neiglabourhood of riymouth was scut to me for examination by
Mr. Speucc Bate and Mr. Brooking Eowe ; the former likewise courteously
gave me the use of some careful drawings, from which sources the following
list is drawn up. As not unfreqiiently happens with such animals, the

specimens were in an indifferent state of preservation, especially those
which had been placed in glycerine. Although somewhat softened, how-

ever, they were of great interest, and much care had evidently been be-
stowed on their collection. As a series entirely from the southern shores of

England, they form an advantageous contrast with the collections of Mr.

Gwyn Jeffi-eys, which come from the opposite extremity of the British

Islands, xii. from the Zetlandic seas.

   The majority of the species are weU-known forms, and with regard to
these it is only necessary to refer to the list. Amongst the rarer forms,

Lepidonotus dava, Mont., seems to be plentiful, whereas on most of our
shores it is not commonly met with. Its speckled and adherent scales,
swollen and ringed cirri, and stout yellow bristles render it an easHy recog-

nized species. The Nereis Marionii, Aud. & Ed., has not hitherto been re-

corded as British, and appears to be chiefly a southern form, for I have not
yet found it elsewhere than in the Channel Islands and in this collection
from Plymouth. It is characterized by the great development of the superior
lobe of the foot towards the posterior end of the body. Onuphis sicida,

De Quatref., is also comparatively common. The range of this species extends

from the Shetland Islands to the Mediterranean. It has jointed bristles, as
in Eunice, and the examples were in tubes of gravel and sand. The very

large size of some of the specimens of Cirratuhis cirratiis calls for notice. I

have not seen larger. The occurrence of TereheUa medusa, Sav., a gigantic
form, is likewise interesting ; and it is probable that TereheUa gigantea of
Montagu refers to this species. The hooks correspond with that figured by
Dr. Malmgren *, from a specimen procured in the Ilcd Sea near Suez, and
have five (rarely six) distinctly separated teeth. The TerebeJla {Pohjmnia)
Danielsseni of Malmgren is a new British form, distinguished by the three
 comparatively short branchiaj and the shape of the hooks, which have a

 large fang and two or three small teeth above it.

AReport on the practicability of establishing '' Close Time " for the

  protection of indigenous Animals. By a Committee, consisting of

   ¥. BucKLAND, Rev. H. B. Tristram^ F.R.S., Tegetmeier^ and H.
   E. Dresser (Reporter).

In accordance with the resolution passed at the Meeting of the British Asso-
ciation at JSTorwich in August last, appointing Mr. Prank Buckland, Eev.
H. B. Tristram, Mr. Tegetmeier, and Mr. H. E. Dresser as a Committee for

the purpose of collecting evidence as to the practicability of establishing a

close time for the protection of indigenous animals, this Committee met at
the Zoological Society's rooms (which Dr. Sclater had kindly placed at their
disposal) on the 13th of January last, the Eev. Dr. Tristram being in the chair
and on Professor A. Newton tendering in evidence the information published
by the Yorkshire Association for the Protection of Sea-birds, respecting
the utility of sea-birds, it was resolved, inasmuch as the said Association was

working in the same direction as this Committee, that we should give every

reasonable assistance in furthering the object for which the Association had
been formed, viz. that of getting an Act of Parliament passed to protect the
92 BEPORT-- 1869.

sea-birds during the breeding-season, the reasons given being that sea-birds
 are useful in destrojdng grubs and worms, in acting as scavengers in the
harbours, in warning vessels off the rocks during fogs by their cries, and in
hovering over and pointing out to the iishermen the locality of the shoals

 of fish.

    At the above meeting Mr. J. E. Harting, F.L.S. &c. was proposed and
elected as a member of this Committee.

    Since then the members of your Committee have to the best of their power
cooperated with the Association for the Protection of Sea-birds, and that
Association has fully acknowledged the assistance rendered. The Bill for
the protection of Sea-fowl was entrusted to the care of C. Sykes, Esq., M.P.,
in the Commons, and His Grace the Duke of Northumberland in the Lords,
where it met with a most favoiirable reception.

    Before the Bill passed into Committee a meeting of naturalists was held at
the Hanover Square Booms in order to consider and discuss the various
clauses. However, as the progress of the Bill has been so fiilly reported iii
the newspapers, it is needless to enter into details here, and it will be suffi-
cient to say that at first it was proposed to make it illegal, not only to kill
the birds during the breeding-season, but also to take their eggs ; and the

close time was proposed to extend from the 1st of May to the 1st of August.
However, it was found that so much injurj- would be inflicted on the poorer

classes living on the coast if they were prevented from taking the eggs or
young of the sea-birds, as they are often dependent on these for subsistence,

that the egg clause Avas struck out, and the young, when unable to fly, were
exempted. It was also considered that it would be expedient to exempt the

island of St. Kilda, the inhabitants of that island being so entirely dependent
on sea-birds for their subsistence.

    With these modifications, and the close time being extended one month,
or from the 1st of April to the 1st of August, the BiU became law in June last,
and one conviction has already taken place. The person convicted under this
Act had dead sea-guUs in his possession, and was heavily fined. The Bill for
the protection of sea-birds having now become law, it has to be considered how
far it wiU be advisable to press for its extension to other birds and mammals.
That it wiU be well to afford protection to most, if not all, of our birds, at
least during the breeding-season, your Committee are fully convinced ; but it
yet remains to convince the farmer that he will derive benefit from so doing.

   Our British agriculturist is in general no naturalist, and takes it for granted

that every grain-eating bird must do him harm. He accordingly does his

best to exterminate sparrows and other small birds, little thinking of the
benefit they render him in destroying insects. Nor will the game-preserver,

we fear, countenance so sweeping a measure until he is fully convinced that
it is necessary to put some limit to the ravages made by his gamekeeper

amongst our feathered friends.

   On the continent, and particularly where zoology forms a branch of study

in the schools of agriculture (as in Germany, Sweden, «S:c.), the utility of

many of our birds, which with us are persecuted as vermin, is fully recognized,

and instead of forming sparrow clubs, the agriculturists there take steps to

protect the feathered tribes.
    In the grain-growing countries of Russia near and in every s'illage small

boxes and sections of hoUow branches may be seen fixed on to trees, barns,

  We* may here state that an Act protecting the sea-birds, not only during the breeding-

season, but during the whole year, has been for some time in force in the Isle of Man, and
has had the effect of almost entirely stopping the destruction of sea-fowl on that island.
      ON THE PRACTICABILITV OF ESTABLISHING "a CLOSE TIME." 03

houses, &c., in order to induce sparrows and starlings to take up their abode
there, and assist in freeing the crops from dcstractivc insects. Sparrows,
starlings, and particularly jackdaws swarm near most of these villages, and,
according to what the peasants say, are of infinite use in freeing the crops
from insects.

    In Sweden, also, the starling is an especial favourite with the agriculturist,
and the Principal of the Bcida Forest School, Jagmastare Boman, makes
every one of his pupils prepare and hang up a certain number of these nesting-
boxes, or " holkar," before leaving the school.

    The late Mr. Charles Waterton also recommended the introduction into
England of this plan of providing nesting-boxes for starlings.

   In speaking of the starling, we may refer to a letter from Universitiits

Forstmeister Wiese, published in the ' Journal flir Ornithologie,' 1866, p. 422,
in which he urges the necessity of putting up nesting-boxes for starlings, and
states that at Elisenhain in the Griefswald the oak-forests were suffering
severely from the devastations of Tortriv viridana, when, to destroy this
insect, the starlings were protected, and these birds soon succeeded in keep-

ing down the numbers of this insect.

   Some agriculturists of New Zealand are at the present moment endeavour-

ing, at considerable expense, to introduce into those islands the rook, the

jackdaw, and the starling, for the purpose of protecting their crops from the
ravages of caterpillars and locusts.

    The best mode of judging of the good or harm done by birds is most cer-
tainly that of stiidi/inff the nature of their food; and as almost all our smallest
birds, even those which are chiefly graminivorous, feed their nestlings on in-
sects, it would surely benefit the farmer and gardener were they protected

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

during the time when the insects are most destructive to the crops. Even
the Raptores should, we think, be protected ; and in proof of this we may refer
to Professor Newton's paper on the " Zoological aspect of Game-Laws," read

at the last Meeting of the British Association, and the Eev. Dr. Tristram's
theory propounded at the Jileeting in 1867, viz. that the birds of prey are
the sanitary police of nature, and that if they had existed in their original
strength they would have stamped out the grouse-disease, inasmuch as hawks
in preference make sickly birds their quarry.

   Regarding the food of our birds we may make the following short re-

marks :

   The common Buzzard (Buteo vulgaris), yvhich was once, it is true, common
in Great Britain, but is now rapidly approaching the fate of the Great

Bustard, owing chiefly to the mistaken zeal of the gamekeepers, is a bird by
no means injurious to game. Its food consists chiefly of frogs, mice, snails,
&c., and but seldom or never of birds.

    The Kestrel (Falco tinnuncidus) feeds almost entu'ely on field-mice, but also
cats beetles and grasshoppers.

    The Merlin (Falco cesalon) feeds chiefly on mice and small birds.
    The Sparrowhawk {Accipiter nisus) is perhaps the only true enemy of the
 game-preserver ; though at the same time it is probable that if the good and
evil it does were justly weighed, the balance would be in favour of the hawk,

its favourite quarry being the Woodpigeon, which is now increasing to an

 extent injurious to agriculture.

    As far as owls are concerned. Professor Newton clearly showed, at the

 last Meeting of the British Association, that these birds are of the greatest

 use to the agriculturist in destroying the small mammals which injure his
 crops. Prof. Newton refers to the researchea of Dr. Altum, the results of
94 REPORT 1869.

--which were as follows : In order to ascertain the natnre of the food of the

different owls, Dr. Altum collected pellets, or castings, at different seasons of
the year, from different localities, which pellets he carefully examined.

   Of the Barn-owl {Strix fiammea) he examined 706 rejected pellets, which

contained remains of the following, viz. :

4 Plecotus auritus.                      1 Arvicola campestris.
                                       76 Crossopus fodiens.
11 Vesperugo pipistrellus.           349 Crocidura araneus (and leucodon).
                                    1164 Sorcx vulgaris.
1 Vesperus serotinus.
                                         1 pygmajus.
3 Mus clecumanus.                        1 Talpa europasa.
                                       19 Passer domesticus.
237  musculus, sylvaticus, and mi-       1 FringiUa chloris.
                                         2 Cypselus apus.
     nutus.

34 HypurLTius glareolus.

23 amphibius.

688 Arvicola arvalis.

47 agrestis.

   Of the Wood-owl (Stri.v aluco) he examined 210 pellets, the contents of
which he classifies as follows

   1 Mustela erminea.               48 Talpa europea.

  6 Mus decumanus.                  1 Certhia familiaris.

 42 musculus, sylvaticus, minutus.  1 Emberiza citrinella.
  19 IIypuda;us glareolus.
  1 1 amphibius.                    1 Motacilla alba.
254 Arvicola arvalis.
  12 agrestis.                      15 Small birds (sp.?).

    1 Sciurus vulgaris.             15 Carabus granulatus.
   5 Crossopus fodiens.
   3 Crocidura araneus.             4 Harpalus         ?
 20 Sores vulgaris.
   5 pygmteus.                      9 Ditiscus marginalia.

                                    14 Scarabeus stercorarius.

                                    1 sylvaticus.

                                    1 Elater    ?

                                    1 Silpha rugosa.

and large quantities of Melolontha vulgaris, some of the pcUets consisting
entirely of the remains of these insects.

   Of the Short-oared Owl (Strix hracliyotus) he examined a few pellets,
which he found to contain only remains of Hypudceus amphibius ; but as
these were only obtained from one locality where this mouse is especially
abundant. Dr. Altum reserves his remarks on the food of this owl until he
can make further investigations.

   Of the Long-cared Owl {Strix otus) he examined many pellets, which con-

tained remains as follows :

 14 Mus sylvaticus.                 65 Arvicola agrestis.
                                     2 Sores vulgaris.
    1 Hypvida?us amphibius.          3 Birds, sp.?
  12 glareolus.
193 Arvicola arvalis.

   The above proves most clearly that our owls should be protected, as in
destroying mice &c. they are benefitting the agriculturist. Not only, how-
ever, do the owls, as is above shown, feed chiefly on mice, but the Wood-
owl {Strix aluco) is often insectivorous ; and Mr. Leopold Martin of Berlin
(Journal fiir Ornithologic, 1854, p. 93) states that he found in the stomach
of one of these birds the remains of no less than 75 Sphinx pinastri.

   Many of our smaller birds arc entirely insectivorous, and are undoubtedly
useful at all seasons of the year ; and of these we may in particular refer to

the Woodpeckers and Titmice, the latter of which feed largely on the eggs of

Bomhyx pini, which is so destructive to the pine forests. Every female of
this moth will lay from 600 to 700 eggs, and were it not that they are kept
down in number liy the tits they would increase enormously. Count 0.
Wodzicki, in a small work on the influence of birds in destroying inju-
        ON THE PRACTICABILITY OF ESTABLISHING A'^ CLOSE TIME/' 95

 rious insects, published at Lemberg in 1851, calculates that a single tit

 will devour 1000 insects' eggs in a single dag, and besides, the tits feed their
 young chiefly on insects' eggs and caterpillars. Count Wodzicki mentions in

particular Sitta europcea, Qerthia familiaris, and the Eegulidce, as being

useful in destroying Bombyx pini. He also mentions that the Woodpeckers

 are of great utility in destroying the following insects, viz. Noctua pinastri,

 Geonietm piniaria, Sphinx p>inastn, Tenthredo jnni, T. septentrionalis, Bos-

 trichus typographus, and B. clialcographus. M. C. von Heyden also remarks

 (Journal fiir Ornithologie, 1859, pp. 316, 317) that in the winter Sitta

--europcea and Parus major feed on the larvae of Cecidomyia fagi, the Beech-

 gall insect, and states as follows : " The well-known conical gaU of this

insect is often found in large numbers on the upper side of the beech-leaves.
In the autumn it becomes hard like wood, and falls off the leaf. These birds
then search carefully on the ground under the trees for the galls, and after
pecking a hole (generally in the side of the point of the gall), pick out and
devour the insect. The hole is generally so small that the insect cannot
be extracted with the beak, and the bird must use its tongue for that pur-

pose. It is curious that the bird should bore a hole at the hard point of the

gall when the base is merely closed by the thin paper-like web of the

 insect."

    Professor Buckman has also recently observed that the Blue-tit {Farm
cceruleus) destroys the flies which make the oak-galls, which in many parts of

the country threaten to ruin the young oak-plantations.

   Many of our seed-eating birds are useful, not only because they feed on
the seeds of injurious weeds, but also on destructive insects ; and our common

Yellowhammer {Emberiza citrinella) feeds with avidity on the caterpillar of

the white Butterfly (Pieris rapm).

    Mr. Mewes, the well-known Swedish naturalist, states (Ofversigt af Kongl.
Vetenskaps Akademiens Forhandlingar, 1868, p. 256) that at Borgholm in
Sweden he found the oak-woods near the castle almost stripped of their leaves
by Tortrix viridana, and that numbers of birds were feeding on the larva; of
this insect, amongst which he names the common Crossbill {Loxia curvi-
rostra), which, though in general a seed-eater, was in that instance doing

good service in eating insects. He states that flocks of these birds were

busily employed in destroying this insect.

   The much-persecuted Sparrow (Passer domesticiis) is also a good friend to

the agriculturist, and amply repays him for the little corn he may take by
destroying many injurious insects, and in eating the seeds of many rank

weeds.

    During the winter the Tree-sparrow (Passer montanus) feeds chiefly on
the seeds of Urtjca divica, Chenopodium album, and Polygonum avicidare, all
of which are injurious weeds.

    It is true that the House-sparrow is a grain-eating bird, but its nestlings
are fed chiefly on insects. Mr. Berthold Wicke, of Gottingen (Henneberg's
Journal fiir Landwirthschaft, 16 Jahrgang, 3 Heft) examined the contents of
the stomachs of 118 sparrows procured between the 21st of April and 24th of

--June, and gives the following results of his investigations : Of these birds, 45

were adults and 73 young, ranging from the small naked nestling to the full-

mfledged bird. In the stomachs of three of the adult birds he found only grain,
    one nothing but the remains of a few beetles ; one had the stomach and
crop so full of grain that he counted 50 grains ; one stomach contained the
seed of weeds, pieces of peas and seeds of Stellaria media, and the rest con-
tamed corn with the remains of beetles ; and in one was the entire skin of a

Melolontha vidgaris.
--96 REPORT 1869.

    Whereas, however, the stomachs of the adult birds contained chiefly grain
and but a small proportion of insect-remains, it proved to be entirely the
reverse as regards the young birds. Out of the 73 he examined, the sto-
machs of 46 contained insects, larvse, caterpillars, &c., and only 9 contained
vegetable matter alone. Of the remaining stomachs 10 contained the re-
mains of insects mixed with a few seeds, 7 contained chiefly seeds with a
small proportion of insect-remains, and 1 contained eggshells and small
stones without trace of anything else.

   Our American cousins have recognized the utility of the sparrow, and have

introduced it into New York, where it is now found comparatively numerous,

and has been most useful in keeping the trees free from caterpillars, which
before its introduction threatened seriously to injure them.

    Our thrushes and blackbirds are also most useful to the gardener from
the quantities of slugs and snails thej- destroy, and our rook is universally
acknowledged to be a most useful bird.

   Much information as to the nature of the food of birds is, however, yet
needed in order to judge correctly of the amount of good or harm they do

and it would be well if the question were fully ventilated in the newspapers,
and naturalists resident in diff'erent parts of the country encouraged to make

investigations as to the nature of the food of the diSerent species of birds,

and compare the results of such investigations.
    Your Committee felt, however, sure that the good done by birds will be

found largely to predominate over the harm, and that it will prove expedient
to afford them protection during the breeding-season.

    It is, however, a measure that will require considerable time to carry

through, and we would suggest that the best mode of affordiug the necessary
protection to birds would be to prohibit the carr}T.ng of a gun during the
breeding- season, as is now done in several parts of the continent, as, for

instance, in Switzerland, some parts of Prance, &c. In the United States of
North America, where freedom of action exists more perhaps than anywhere
else, the close-time system is to a large extent carried out, and has proved

most beneficial, though, as may be supposed, it is most difficult to enforce in

 a thinly popidated country.

    Much information is, however, yet needed as to the practical working of the

 close-time system in those countries where it has been in force, and your
 Committee hope ere long to be able to procure reliable particulars on this

 point.

    Generally it is said to work excelleutly, and, far from interfering with the
 game-preservers, it has been found to act in harmony with their views.
 Were it enforced here in England it would have the good effect of stopping

 the damage done by idle men and boys, who on Sundays are in the habit

 of soing out in the neighbourhood of the towns to shoot small birds.

nity of visiting the important works at Barrow-in-Furnoss, and from there I
have received bars and plates of different qualities for the purpose of experi-

ment, and such as would admit of comparison with those recorded in my last

Report. I have also received specimens from Mr. Heaton for experiment,
illustrative of the new process of conversion from crude pig iron (of different

grades) to that of steel, as exhibited in the results contained in this Eeport.
   In every experimental research connected with metals, it is necessary to

ascertain, as nearly as possible, the properties of the ores, the quality of the

material, and the processes by which they are produced. Generally this in-

formation is difficult to obtain, as in every new process of manufacture there

is a natural inclination (where the parties are commercially interested) to

keep it as long as possible to themselves, and hence the reluctance to furnish

particulars. Of this, however, I can make no complaint, as Mr. Bessemer,
the Barrow Company, and Mr. Heaton have unreservedly not only opened

their works for inspection, but they have furnished every particular required

(including chemical analysis) relative to the properties of the ores, and the
processes by which they are reduced.

   From this it will be seen that in some of the experiments I have had the

privilege of recording the chemical as well as the mechanical properties of the
specimens which have been forwarded for the purpose of experiment, and of

ascertaining their respective and comparative values.
   As regards the works at Barrow, I have, througli the kindness of Mr.

Ramsden and Mr. Smith the manager, received every facility for investigation,
and they have kindly sent me the analyses of all the ores in use for the pur-

pose of manufacturing both iron and steel. In these "Works, it wiU be noticed

that the manufacture is exclusively confined to the htematite ores, and that
by the Bessemer process.

    It is curious to trace the progressive development of the manufacture of

steel from the earliest period down to the present time, and to ascertain how

nearly the more premature and early stages of manufacture approaches to

those of Bessemer and others in our own days. To show how closely they

approximate in princixile (the exception being in the vessels used and the

power employed), I venture to quote from my own Report to the Barrow

Company, in which the coincidence between the ancient and modern processes

is exemplified.

   In treating of the value of the ha3matite formation, I have stated that "we
have no reliable accounts of the time when the haematite ores were first iised

for the purpose of manufacture. They must have existed contemporary with

those in Susses and the Forest of Dean ; for the numerous cinder-heaps in

those counties and at Furness bear evidence of the smelting-process having

been carried on from an early period, untU the forests became exhausted during

the reign of Elizabeth and her successors. The process by which the ores

were reduced in those days was extremely rude and simple, and was probably
no better than what had been practised from time immemorial at the ancient

bloomeries, to which were attached artificial blasts, first practised in this

country after the Roman conquest. "What was the nature of the apparatus

for producing this blast we are unable to ascertain ; but it is likely that two
or more pairs of bellows may have been used, or the method, still practised

by the natives of Madagascar, might have been adopted of fitting pistons

loosely into the hollow trunks of trees. In whatever form the hsematite ores
were reduced, it is clear that the smelting-furnace was not in operation in

1869.                                                                                                                                                     H
98 REPORT--1869.

those days ; aud assumiug that the bloomery was the only process in use, the
result would be a species of relined iron or steel, wliich, deprived of the greater
part of its carbon, would become malleable under the hammer.

   " It is interesting to observe how nearly our imiwoved modern process of
making steel a])proaches to that of those rude and early times. The Bessemer

system is neither more nor less than the old process of the bloomery and the

Catalan furnace, the former being adapted to smelt the ore, aud the latter to

decarbonize and refine it into the malleable state of iron or steel.

" That such was the state of the early manufacture of hsematite iron can

hardly be questioned, as the country around Ulverston was covered with
forests ; and the name given to Furness Abbey shows that its site was in the
vicinity of furnaces, employed exclusively for the reduction of the ores with

which the surrounding country abounds. The remains of these ancient fur-
naces have to some extent been carried down to our own times, and Messrs.
Harrison and Co. still manufacture a fine quality of charcoal iron, the wood

being obtained from the adjoining forests. The new works at Barrow have,
however, entirely changed the nature of this process ; and the system of manu-

facturing direct from the ore has become a question of such importance, as to

induce an investigation of its value, and the improvements it is likely to effect

both in the maniifacture of iron and steel. For this object the foUomng

experiments have been instituted, in order to show the peculiar properties of

this manufacture, and the extent to which it is applicable for the general

purposes of trade aud constructive art.

" The proprietors of the Barrow Works have confined themselves to certain

descriptions of manufacture, on the Bessemer principle, these being chiefly

steel rails, tyres, plates, and girders, manufactured at a comparatively low

price. From the nature of the ore and fuel (the latter of which is chiefly
brought by rail from the coal-fields of Durham and Northumberland) a

description of liighly refined homogeneous iron and steel is produced ; and

as this manufacture is intended for purposes where tenacity aud flexibility

are required, it would not be just to compare it with other descriptions of

manufacture, where the object to be attained is hardness, such, for instance,

as that employed for carriage-springs and tools. The descrii^tion of steel or

iron required for rails, beams, girders, &c. is of a differeut character ; te-

nacity combined with flexibility is what is wanted, to which may be added
powers to resist imi)act. The same may be said of wheel-tyres and other

constructions, where the strains are severe, and where the material is suf-

ficiently ductile to prevent accidents from vibration, or those shocks and

blows to wMch it may be subjected. Keepiug these objects in view, the

Barrow Company's Works have, to a great extent, been limited to this de-

scription of manufacture ; and, judging from the ductility of the material as

exhibited in the experiments, there is Kttle chance of accidents from brittleness

when subjected to severe transverse strains, or to the force of impact.

" In calculating the value of the hsematite steel, we have been guided by

the same formulae as adopted for comparison with similar productions from

other works. Yery few of them, however, wiU admit of comparison, as no

two of them appear to be alike. The haematite steel is manufactured, at the

Barrow Works, for totally diff'erent purposes from those of other makers, and

ha^·ing the command of a variety of ores for selection (as may be seen

from the analysis of the ores given in the Table) the desired quality of steel

Wecan be obtained at pleasure.  have therefore submitted the diff'erent

specimens to the same tests as those received from other makers, not only for

the purpose of ascertaining wherein their powers of resistance difi'er, but also
ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF STEEL.                            99

wherein consists their superiority as regards deflection, elongation, and com-

pression, from all of which may be inferred their nature and properties, and
the uses to which they may be applied. It is for this purpose wo have

appHed the same formulae of reduction to each particular class of experiments
as in the former cases, and the results have been embodied in the summaries.

If, for example, it were required to know the modulus of elasticity, the
work of deflection, or the unit of working strength, these will be found in

their respective columns, carefully deduced from the experiments as given in
the Tables. The same principle for ascertaining the amount of work done to
produce rupture from tension has been followed, and the force required to
produce compression wdth a given load has also been calculated with the
same degree of care and attention to facts.

   " As the Bessemer principle of manufacturiug direct from the ore is calcu-
lated to jiroduce great improvements and important changes in the produc-
tion of refined iron and steel, and as the homogeneous properties of the ma-

terial thus produced are of the highest importance as regards security, &c.,

it is essential to construction that we should be familiar with the mechanical
properties of the material in every form and condition to which it may be

applied.

    " For this purpose I have given aU the various forms of strain, excepting only
that of torsion, which is of less moment, as the strains already described in-
volve considerations which apply with some extent to that of torsion, and from

which may be inferred the fitness of the material for the construction of shafts

and other similar articles to which a twisting strain applies.
    " The great advantage to be derived from the Barrow manufacture of steel

is its ductility combined with a tensile breaking strain of from 32 to 40 tons

per square inch. With these qualities I am informed that the proprietors are

able to meet aU the requirements of a demand to the extent of lOUO to 1200
tons of steel i)er week, which, added to a weekly produce of 4500 tons of pig-
iron, will enable us to form some idea of the extent of a maniifacture destined
in aU probabihty to become one of the most important and one of the largest

in Great Britain"*.

   From the above statement it may be inferred that the description of manu-
facture practised at Barrow is carried on upon a large scale, and the products

have reference to certain properties almost exclusively adapted to the formation

of wheel-tyres, rails, and jjlates. To the attainment of these objects the
greatest care and attention is devoted by the Company, as may be seen by com-
paring the reduction of the experiments in the simimary of results.

    In this extended inquiry I have endeavoured to deduce true and correct results
from the specimens with which I have been favoured from the Barrow Steel

Company. In the same manner I have now to direct attention to the products
of an entirely new system of manufacture introduced by Mr. Heaton of the
Langley MiUs, near Nottingham. The experiments on this peculiar manu-

facture require a separate introductory notice, as the process of conversion is

totally different to that of Bessemer, the Puddling-furuace, or that of the old
system of the Charcoal-beds.

    For the finer description of steel the old process of conversion is still prac-
tised at Shefiield, from a fortnight to three weeks being required for the con-
version of wrought iron into steel ; and, with the exception of Mr. Siemens's
Eeverberatory Gas-furnace, there no improvements had been made on it until

* In round numbers, it is stated tliat the produce of the Barrow Mines is 000,000 tons

of ore per annum ; of the Barrow Blast-furnaces 230,000 tons of pig-iron ; and of the

Eolling Mills 60,000 tons of steel rails, tyres, plates, &e.

100 REPORT--1869.

Mr. Bessemer first announced his invention by means of which melted pig-iron
was at once converted into steel.

   This new process of forcing atmospheric air through the metal in a molten
state took metallurgists by surprise ; and when it was taken into consideration
that the conversion was effected in twenty minutes and at one heat, the ques-

tion became one of absorbing interest to the whole of the commercial popu-

lation.

   By the old process the metal was first deprived of its carbon and reduced
to the malleable state, when it was rolled into bars and retained (as above

described) from fourteen to twenty-one days in charcoal-beds until it had

absorbed by cementation the necessary quantity of carbon. The new process

of Mr. Heaton, unlike that either of Mr. Bessemer or of cementation, simply

deals with the pig-iron, and, according to his own statement, eliminates the
superfluous carbon, so that steel is in the first place produced and thence wrought
iron by a still further elimination of the carbon. This is totally different to
the puddling or the Bessemer process, wliich in the former was tedious and
expensive, wliilst in the latter the pig-iron was rendered malleable without
any additional fuel and ready for the hammer or the rolls in a very short

period of time.
    It is unnecessary to notice in detail the subsequent mechanical processes of

reheating, rolling, hammering, &c., which are common to all the systems of

conversion ; it is, however, important to mention that an admixture of sjjie-
geleisen, a description of cast iron containing an excess of carbon, is made into
the molten mass, without which the conversion is not easily effected by the
Bessemer process.

    It is asserted by some writers on this subject, "that, whatever are the merits
of the Bessemer process, the conversion cannot be effected without a destructive
action upon the converters, and a rapid wear and tear of the tu)''eres, that
there is waste in filling the moulds, and that the heavy royalties attached to
the patents ttc. are serious drawbacks to the extension of the process." Mr.
Hewitt, a writer on this subject, comes to the conclusion "that good steel can
only be made from good material, no matter what i^rocess is employed;" and
he further stales " that the Bessemer process wiU not, as Mr. Bessemer origi-
nally supposed, supersede the puddling-process, which appears to be as yet the
only method applicable to the conversion of by far the greater portion of pig-
iron made into wrought iron, because by far the larger portion of pig-iron
made is of a quality not good enough for the Bessemer process, which abso-
lutely exacts the absence of sulphur and phosphorus."

   There may be some truth in this statement, as it was found necessary, in
the selection of the haematite ores at Barrow, to make use of the best quality,

and only seven or eight out of twenty sorts were found suitable for the pur-
pose. It is, however, evident from the rapid extension of the process and the
estimation in which it is held by manufacturers and the general public, that
whatever objections the process is subject to (on purely economical grounds)
Mr. Bessemer has succeeded in carrying out the pneumatic principle of con-
version to the highest degree of excellence at present attainable by that

process.

    In so important a branch of metallurgy it would be remarkable if Mr. Bes-
semer had hit upon the only feasible means of converting iron into steel.
Other minds have been inspired by Mr. Bessemer's success in the same direc-
tion ; and the admixture of metals to effect a transmutation has been assumed

in many forms and proportions so as to increase our knowledge and lessen the
cost of production. Amongst those is the new process of Mr. Heaton, a de-
ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF STEEL.                         101

scription of Avhich we venture to transcribe from a pamphlet published by the

proprietors of the Heaton process.

   " The furnace (which is a common cnpola) is charged with pig-iron and
coke, and fired in the usual waj% and the iron when melted is drawn off into

a ladle, from which it is transferred to the converter.

   "The converter is a wrought-iron pot lined with fire-brick. In the bottom

is introduced a charge of crude nitrate of soda, usually in the proportion of

2 ewt. per ton of converted steel, usually but not invariably diluted with
about 25 lb. of siliceous sand. This charge is protected or covered over with
a close-fitting perforated iron plate weighing about 100 lb., the diameter of
the plate being about 2 feet. The converter, with its contents, is then
securely attached, by moveable iron clamps, to the open mouth of a sheet-
iron chimney, also lined for 6 feet with fire-brick, and the melted iron taken
in a crane ladle from the cupola is poured in. The subsequent part of the
process is thus described by Professor Miller.

   " ' In about two minutes a reaction commenced. At first a moderate
quantity of brown nitrous fumes escaped ; these were followed by copious
blackish, then grey, then whitish fumes, produced by the escape of steam,

carrying with it in suspension a portion of the flux. After the lapse of five
or six minutes, a violent deflagration occurred, attended with a loud roaring
noise and a burst of brilliant yellow flame from the top of the chimney. This
lasted for about a minute and a half, and then subsided as rapidly as it com-
menced. "When all had become tranquil, the converter was detached from
the chimney, and its contents were emptied on to the iron pavement of the

foimdry.

   " ' The crude steel was in a pasty state and the slag fluid ; the cast-iron
perforated plate, which was placed as a cover to the converter, bad become
melted up and incorporated with the charge of molten metal. The slag had
a glassy or blebby appearance, and a dark or green colour in mass.' Professor
Miller proceeds to detail the subsequent parts of the process, and the results

of his analysis of some of the products.

  A" * mass of crude steel from the converter was then subjected to the

hammer.
   " ' About 4| ewt. of the crude steel was transferred to an empty but hot

reverberatory furnace, where in about an hour's time it was converted into
four blooms, each of which was hammered, rolled into square bars, cut up,

passed through a heating-furnace, and roUed into rods varying in thickness

from 1 inch to five-eighths of an inch.
    " ' Three or four ewt. of the crude steel from the converter was transferred

to a reheating furnace, then hammered into flat cakes, which, when cold, were
broken up and sorted by hand for the steel melter.

   " ' Two fireclay pots, charged with a little clean sand, were heated, and

into each 42 lb. of the cake steel was charged ; in about six hours the melted
metal was cast into an ingot.

   " ' Two other similar pots were charged with 35 lb. of the same cake steel,

7 lb. of scrap steel, and 1 ounce of oxide of manganese. These also were

poured into ingots.
   " ' The steel was subsequently tilted, but was softer than was anticipated.
    " ' These residts are on the whole to be considered rather as experimental

than as average working samples.
   " ' I have therefore made an examination of the following samples only :

No. 4. Crude Cupola Pig.      No. 8. Eolled Steely Iron.
                              No. 5. Slag from the converter.

is mechanically diifused through the slag.

" ' The proportion of slag to the yield of crude steel iron was not ascertained

by direct experiment; but, calculating from the materials employed, its maxi-

mum amount could not have exceeded 23 per cent, of the weight of the charge

of molten metal. Consequently tlie 12-6 per cent, of irou in the slag would

not be more than 3 per cent, of the iron operated on.

" ' In conclusion, I have no hesitation in stating that Heaton's process is

based upon correct chemical principles ; the mode of attaining the result is

both simple and rapid. The nitric acid of the nitrate in this operation imparts

oxygen to the impurities always present in cast iron, converting them into

compounds which combine with the sodium                                                                                                                                                                                      and these are removed with the

sodium in the slag. This action of the sodium is one of the peculiar features

of the process, and gives it an advantage over the oxidizing methods in com-

mon use.'

"The slag produced is akeady utilized at the works, and forms the subject

of a new and valuable patent. There is every reason to believe that the

products of combustion may, by the means of a mechanical arrangement,

devised by Mr. Heaton, be further utilized and afford a large set-off on the

original cost of the nitrate. It is also a great question whether the phosphorus

may not be most profitably reduced from the slag for commercial purposes."

In addition to Mr. Miller's statement, Mr. Robert Mallet reported on the

subject and expressed himself highly satisfied with the results, both as regards

the chemical and physical properties of the metal ; and having been present

at the experiments made on Mr. Kirkaldy's testing machine, he states the

results as under :
104 REPORT 1869.

   With these observations I have now to refer to the drawings of the furnaces

and apparatus which I have attached in illustration as an Appendix. In

conclusion I may state that, looking at this new process and its further develop-
ment as a step in advance of what has already been done by Bessemer and
others, we may reasonably look forward to a new and important epoch in the

history of metaUurgic science.

    Before entering upon the experiments, it will be necessary to repeat the

formula of reduction as given in my previous Report of 1867. This appears

to be the more requisite, as it may be inconvenient to refer to the Transactions

of 1867, where it was originally introduced.

c=S'                                      (i2>

which gives the value of C, the modulus of strength, or the unit of ivorhing

Wstrength, being the load, determined by experiment, which strains the bar

up to the elastic limit. This value of C gives the comparative permanent or
working strength of the bar.

    Up to the elastic limit the deflections are ^proportional to their corresponding
strains, but beyond this point the deflections increase in a much higher ratio.
Hence the deflection corresponding to the elastic limit is the greatest deflec-

tion which is found to foUow the law just explained.

 --For the reduction of the Experiments on Tension and Compression.- The

work n expended in the elongation of a uniform bar, 1 foot in length and

1 inch in section, is expressed by

^=rri:=k^^'                               (^^^

              pI

=where Pj=^=strain in lbs. reduced to unity of section, and Z^ j-=the cor-

responding elongation reduced to unity of length.

   The value of u, determined for the different bars subjected to experiment,
gives a comparative measure of their powers of resistance to a strain analogous

to that of impact.

   By taking Pj to represent the crushing pressure per unity of section, and

Zj the corresponding compression per unit of length, the foregoing formula

will express the work expended in criishing the bar.
   Having given the formulae for calculating the resisting powers of the steel

bars to a transverse, tensile, and compressive strain, and the amount of work
expended in producing fracture, we now proceed to the experiments, as

follows.

measvired by about | of the whole deflection, showing that this load was
considerably within that requisite to produce rupture. Owing to the high

flexibility of the haematite bars, their modulus of elasticity is low. It may

be here worthy of observation that, for bars of the same length, the modulus

of elasticity varies inversely as the coefficient (DJ of the deflection for

E --unity of pressure and section, that is, oo -.

These bars underwent a great elongation by a tensile strain, and a large

compression by a compressive strain, the average elongation being, per unit

of length, -0792, and that of compression ·41 9 ; whereas these numbers for

the other bars, before experimented upon, did not, on an average, exceed

·06 and -355 respectively, showing the flexibility and superiority of this

steel in its powers to resist impact. The average tensile resistance of the

bars is about 3-5 tons per square inch, whereas the resistance for the other

Bessemer bars, before experimented upon, was about 42 tons ; so that the

tensile strength of the latter is 4 greater than that of the former.

The quality of hardness of steel and wrought iron may be comparatively

measured by the amount of extension under a given tensile strain, and the

amount of compression under a given compressive strain. Applying this

test to the results of the experiments on the various steel bars, we find that

the hardest bars are the strongest, irresj[>ctlve of the companies hij whom they

Wewere manufactured.  find, for example, that the elongation per unit of

length for eight of the best Bessemer bars did not exceed -018, and the

compression per unit of length did not exceed -25. These bars had a

temper probably exceeding that of spring-steel, and less than that for tools.

The haematite bars are of a totally diff'erent description of steel from that

manufactured for springs and tools, and this accounts for their compara-

tively low powers of resistance.

The experiments first made upon the haematite steel are anomalous. The

first bar experimented upon showed great powers of resistance, but the last

two gave results inferior to those obtained by the last experiments. At the

same time the value (D,) for unity of pressure and section, ia the first exjie-

rimeuts, is somewhat below the general average of the results of all the

other experiments, thereby giving a considerable value to the modulus of elas-

ticity. I suspect that the temper of the first bar was high ; but Avhether the last

two bars had a temper too high or too low, I am at a loss to determine. If

it is desirable to have full justice done to the haematite steel bars as to their

powers of resistaiice, a series of bars of the same degree of hardness as to

the first bar mentioned, which gave considerably more than average powers

of resistance, should be made, in order to compare with the harder descrip-

--tions of steel, as exhibited by other makers numbers of which have, no

doubt, been melted in the crucible, and selected for the purposes of ex-

periment.

                       Abstract of the Experiments on the Heaton Steel.

    This steel being the product of a totally different process of manufacture
from that of aU the other steel bars previously experimented vipou, and as

those bars were derived from the best known processes and received from
the best of makers, it is a matter of the greater moment to ascertain how it
stands ia relation to them as regards strength and those other properties which

are pecuKar to steel. It is for this object that an abstract separate fi-om that
of the Barrow steel manufacture has been drawn up.

   These bars, in their resistance to a transverse strain, show a very decided
superiority over the steel bars which I experimented upon before, and on
142 REPORT-- 1869.

which I reported to the British Association of 18G7. For instance, the mean
value of C, the unit of working strength for these bars, is 7-494 tons, whereas
this value for the other bars was only 5-746 tons, showing that these bars
are -3 stronger. The value of u, or the work of deflection for unity of
section, for these bars is 90-970, whereas for the other steel bars it is only
51-696. This value of u exhibits the powers of the several bars to resist a
force analogous to that of impact. It is therefore clearly shown that this
steel must be peculiarly well adapted to resist the force of sudden shocks,
considering that it is | superior in this quality to any other of the steel bars

before experimented upon.

    The flexibility of this steel is slightly inferior to that of other steel ; the
measure of flexibility (DJ being for these bars -001345, and for the other
bars -001361. The modulus of elasticity is somewhat low for steel, although

myat the same time it is very little below the general average of those from

former experiments.
    This steel, I consider, well adapted to withstand severe transverse strains,

for it combines the two essential qualities of great strength and superior
powers in its resistance to the force of impact.

   The mean breaking tensile strain, per square inch of section, of this steel is

45-28 tons ; whereas this value for the other steel bars, before experimented
upon, is 41-77 tons. The Heaton bars are, therefore, -08 stronger in their
resistance to the force of tension than the average result obtained from
the steel bars previously experimented upon. This result, whilst placing

the Heaton steel in a highly satisfactory position when compared with the
mean of the whole of the steel experimented upon, places it at the same
time below that produced by some individual manufacturers. The elongation
of these bars was considerable, and a good deal above the mean for the other
bars, thereby giving a large value for the work done in breaking the bar.

    These bars show high powers of resistance to a compressive strain,
aU the specimens having undergone the test of 100 tons on the square inch
without any visible external signs of fractiire.

    It would be very difficult to compare the diff"erent bars in their resistance
to compression, for nearly all the specimens underwent a strain of above 100
tons on the square inch without exhibiting the slightest trace of a crack.
As the lever by which the specimens were crushed was not competent to
produce a greater strain, it was impossible to find out the crushing weight ; be-
sides, even then, supposing it possible to produce the requisite strain, it would
be a task of extreme difficulty to find out at what precise weight the column
began to give way. Under these circumstances, it can only be left to the
judgment of the person wishing to select steel to resist a compressive force
to choose that which he thinks best adapted to his purpose, the choice being
regulated by the ductility of the metal as exhibited by the amount of compres-
sion. In looking through the experiments, however, one thing is clear, that
the hardest steels sustained very little compression, whilst the softer ones, in
the majority of cases, were reduced to almost half their original height.

   From this abstract it will be seen that this steel, manufactured by Mr.

Heaton, stands in the most favourable light in comparison with steel pro-
duced by other manufacturers ; and if it be taken into consideration that
two-thirds of the iron from which this steel was converted, was composed of

Northamptonshire pig-iron, we may reasonably look forward to this invention

creating a considerable improvement in the j)roductiou and cost of steel.

                              Comparison of Wrour/ht Iron with Steel.

    Having lately had occasion to experiment on some wrought- iron bars, of
                                    ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF STEEL.   143

the best quality, used in the manufacture of armour-plates, by Messrs. J.

Brown aud Co., I avail myself of this opportunity of comparing the results

obtained from this iron with those obtained from the steel bars. The

wrought-iron bars were tested in exactly the same manner as the steel ones,

and were successively subjected to transverse, tensile, aud compressive

strains ; the results obtained from which will be found in the following ab-

stract, where they are compared in their several strains to the steel bars.

The average value of C, the unit of working strength for wrought iron,

is about 2-25 tons, whereas the value of this constant taken for fifteen of

the best steel bars is 7"4 tons, so that the strength of the latter is 3y?Q- times

that of the former. The average value, however, of C for the whole of the

steel bars experimented upon is 5-921, showing that the average strength of

steel in resisting a transverse strain is more than 2| times that of wrought
iron. The mean transverse resistance per square inch for the wrought-iron

bars, at the elastic limit, is equal to 6 C, or 6 x 2^, or I'Si tons, which is some-
what greater than the resistance usually assigned to wrought-iron bars.

The average value of D^, for unity of pressure and section, for the wrought-

iron bars is -00167, whereas the value of this constant for the steel bars is

about -0013, showing that wrought-iron bars have a much greater flexi-

bility than steel bars, and, as a necessary consequence, they have a much

lower modulus of elasticity. Under a transverse strain the work of de-

flection up to the limit of elasticity is exceedingly low for wrought-iron

bars                           but  the work  expended  in  elongation  up to the point of rupture is
                            ;

greater than the average of that determined for the steel bars : this is o-wing

to the extensihiVity of the wrought iron ; for whilst the unit of elongation for

the average of the steel bars is not quite -05, that of wrought iron is -14, or

about three times greater. The same observation applies to the work of

compression. The average compression per unit of length is -45, whereas

for the steel bars it is only about '3 of an inch.

The average breaking tensile strain, per square inch of section, of the

wrought-iron bars is 2b\ tons, while this average for the steel bars is 42^

tons, showing that the latter are | stronger than the former. With a

strain of 22| tons per square inch the wrought-iron bars had not entirely

lost their powers of restitution, or the power of regaining, to some extent,

the preceding set.

Although the short columns underwent a large compression under the

action of a compressive force, yet the pressure corresponding to the first

visible indication of rupture is considerable, being, on an average, about

seventy tons per square inch, which is about two-thirds of that of hard steel
columns. With comparatively soft material, like that of wrought iron, it is

difficult to determine the exact point at which the material in such columns

is fractured, so that the fuUest reliance cannot be placed on the results of

such experiments.

  I have appended a general summary of all my experiments on steel, in

order that comparisons may be readily made without the inconvenience of
referring to the preceding Eeport. It may be stated that the experiments

have given good results, aud prove that steel can be produced of double the

strength of wrought iron ; and, at the same time, the homogeneity of its

structure can be depended upon. If the cost of steel be reduced and ap-

proximates closer to that of iron, we may soon look forward for the sub-

stitution of this important metal in the place of iron.

       In addition, to the foregoing experiments, it was considered desirable to

have a steel beam made of the usual form, in order to ascertain the compa-

rative merits of steel and wrought-iron girders. Por this purpose two

beams were constructed, of that quality of steel best suited to ensure dura-

Ability and safety.  much harder description of steel (40 tons to the square

inch) might have been chosen ; but that was not wanted, for the object sought

was ductHity and moderate strength in its powers to resist impact. The fol-

lowing experiments will show the results.

and the bottom part tendered moveable and capable of being withdi-awn on
wheels, without disturbance to the supports &c. of the remaining upper por-
tion of the converter. Ready means of temporary attachment by clamps and
cotters are provided to connect the two parts, which thus so far present a
close resemblance to the Calebasse cupola still in use in Belgium. At one side
of the cyliudric fixed part of the converter, a sort of hopper, with a loosely

hinged iron-plate cover, is provided, which communicates with the cavity

within.

" The lower part, or " converting-pot," has a cylindrical cavity with a flat

bottom, and with the sides near the top edge sloping inwards to a cone all

round. The cavity, up to the level of the lower edge of this cone, is prepared

to just hold the bulk of crude nitrate of soda required for the volume of liquid

iron to be operated on, and for the latter when converted ; the proportion of

nitrate, as at present employed by the patentee, being 2 cwts. to the ton of

liquid iron, or 10 per cent.--a proportion, we may remark, which both the

metallurgists who have been engaged in examining this process by the pre-

sent owners of the patents are of opinion is a good deal in excess of what
is needed, when the conditions for the most favourable reaction shall be more
completely and more scientifically understood. The " converting-pot " is

lined with fire-brick and refractory clay. When the crude nitrate is filled

in and levelled up to, or a trifle beyond, the narrow part of the conical lining,
the cast-iron perforated plate is simply laid upon its level surface, and worked
round a httle until its edges bed firmly into and upon the clay lining. In

this state the converting-pot is rolled in under the upper part of the converter,

clamped up to it, and the whole is now ready for work.

" The charge of cmde cast iron is melted A\-ith coke in an ordinary cupola

at present it is tapped out into a crane-ladle. This is swung round by the

crane, and the contents at once emptied into the opened hopper of the con-

verter. The molten iron falls upon the cold cast-iron plate ; its lowermost

stratum is for the moment chilled and nearly consolidated by the heat with-

drawn by contact, and for some minutes there is no perceptible action. In

this state a vertical section of the charged and filled converter is repre-

sented by fig. 1. Soon, however, tl\e lower stratum recovers its liquidity, and

begins to penetrate below the now more than red-hot and softened perforated

cast-iron plate, and reaction commences, evidenced by the appearance of white

and grey vapours at the top of the converter-funnel. The nitrate has no

doubt by this time got much impacted and partly fused at its upper strata.

The reaction producing a large accession of heat at the plane of contact of

Athe molten iron and of nitrate, the plate melts and disappears.  burst

of brilliant yellow flame at the top of the converter-funnel indicates that

the reaction is then at its height. This lasts steadily for some few minutes

(three to five usually, with 12 or 15 cwt. charges), and then rajudly subsides.

The conversion is now complete. The bottom of the converter, or " converting,

pot," is now detached and roUed away, and the converter is ready for another

bottom and another charge.

   " When we examine the converting-pot withdrawn, we find its surface

covered to the depth of an inch or two with a dark " blabby slag," through

which brilliant jets of yellow sodium-coloured flame from escaping gases are

constantly sparting. This slag consists chiefly of the soda of the nitrate,
combined with silica and clayey matters derived from the hning of the con-
verter, and involving some " shots " of metallic iron or steel, and some little
silicate of iron, &c. Eencath this is the converted metal, which the patentee
calls " crude steel." It forms a white-hot, howsovjlee, and tolerably liquid

mass, not sufficiently fluid upon the small scale of the 12-cwt. converters to

.be readily run or tapped out of the converting-pot, but quite readily capable

of that with a larger converter, and therefore larger mass of material.
   " The converter is upset upon the iron-plated floor, some water is aspersed to

bring the mass to its frangible state at a dull red heat, and it is then broken
up into lumps of convenient size, to be brought, after receiving a little renewal
of heat, under the " shingling hammers," and patted into " cakes of crude

steel," as denominated by the patentee. It is purely a matter of " metallur-

gical taste " whether these are to be called crude steel or crude iron. The

material is in reality a form of steely malleable iron, or mild malleable steel,

whichever we choose to call it. It wiU not harden in water as perfectly as

complete steel ; it always (probably where the process is rightly conducted)

contains more combined carbon than usually belongs to wrought iron. It is,

however, metal of the purest and finest quality, and from which, by two

difl'erent methods of treatment, either very strong, but soft, tough, and mal-

leable, wi'ought iron may be made, or fine cast steel.

"In the fii-st instance the "cakes of crude steel" are piled, heated inacomraon

balUng-furnace, and at once rolled out into "steel-iron" bars, plates, or

rails, &c. ; and so fine is the material that but little difference is produced,

except that of increased fibre, by cutting up, piling, and balling these bars
and rolling a second time.

" Then, for the cast-steel manufacture, these " cakes of crude steel " are

broken or cut up, melted in 60- or 80-lb. crucibles, with about 2 or 3 lb. per

lOU lbs. of spiegeleisen, or its equivalent of oxide of manganese, and some char-

coal, poured out into ingots of iron, i. e. into the usual inciot moulds of iron.
Those ingots of cast steel are then titled into bars, and are then fit for the

market, or for any use to which excellent steel is suitable.
   " This is the whole process through its bifurcate train, up to wrought iron

as good and stronger than Low Moor or Bowling on the one side, and to

cast steel as good as any other process can produce upon the other.
   " Our illustrations (figs. 1 to 6) represent the jjlant, as the patentee, Mr.

Heaton, at present advises its construction, and as proposed for the steel plant

         Bij Dr. P. Maktin Duncan, F.R.S., F. ^ Sec. Geol. Soc.

This Report comprehends the description of the Coi'al-faima of the periods

when the strata of the Gault, Lower Greensand, Portland Oolite, Coral Rag,

Great Oolite, and Inferior OoKte were deposited. It contains a general view
of the physico-geographical conditions of the British area during the Tertiary
and Secondary periods so far as relates to coral growth, and also an enumera-
tion and a list of the species.

   The result of the labour entailed by the study of the Tertiary and Secondary
British FossQ corals has been to add 146 species and many varieties to the
111 or 112 previously known.

   Since the last Report was read, the fossil Corals of the Upper and Lower

Red Chalk and of the Upper Greensand have been published in my mono-

graph for the Palaeontographical Society.

   Much progress has been made in the Report on the Palaeozoic Corals, but

the Report itself cannot be completed for some time.

                                         Corals from the Gault.

   Only six well-marked species of corals were known to MM. Milne-Edwards

and Jules Haime as having been found in the Gault. They were all simple

or solitary forms, and such as one woiild expect to find in moderately deep
water. It is evident that the area occupied by the English Gault was not the
coral tract of the period. The resemblance of the coral-faunas of the Gault
and the London Clay is somewhat remarkable, and probably the physical
conditions of the areas during the deposition of the strata were not very

dissimilar.

Cyathina into that of its predecessor Caryophyllia ; consequently Cyathina

Boiverhanhi, Ed. & H., is now called Cari/ophyllia Bowerbanli, Ed. & H.

                              Genus Tkochoctathtts.

1. Trochocyathiis Ilarvei/anus, Ed. & H.

   This species was described by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime in

their ' Monograph of the British Fossil Corals,' part 1. p. 65. They associated
it with two species, which are, as they suggest, undistinguishable, viz.

Trocliocyatlms Konigi and Trochocyathiis Warhurtoni. The first of these
species is the TurhinoUa Konigi of Mantell.

   An examination of a series of specimens attributed to Trochocyathus
&Harveyanus, Ed. H., and the consideration of the value of the Trochocyathi
just mentioned, have led me to recognize five forms of Trochocyathi breves,

all closely allied and well represented by the original type of Trocliocyathus

Harveyanus, Ed. & H. When placed in a series with this Trochocyathus at

the head, there is a gradation of structure which prevents a strictly specific
distinction being made between the consecutive forms ; but when the first
and the last forms are compared alone, no one would hesitate to assert that
there is a specific distinction between them. All the forms are simple, short,
and almost hemispherical ; all have four cycles of septa and the same propor-
tion of pali. These are the primary and most essential peculiarities of the

genus.

The costse differ in their size, prominence, ornamentation, and relation to

the  septa  in  some of  the  foims                                  and  the  exsert nature of  the  septa, their
                                                                  ;

granulation, and the size of the corallum also differ. The structural differ-

ences are seen in many examples, and are therefore more or less persistent;

nevertheless it is found that whilst several specimens have the septa spring-

ing from intercostal spaces instead of from the ends of the costae, one or more,

having all the other common structural peculiarities, present septa arising

from the costal ends. This method of origin can hardly constitute a specific

distinction. I propose to retain Trochocyathus Harveyanus as the type of

a series of forms, the sum of whose variations in structure constitutes the

species.

    Variety 1. The corallum is nearly double the size of the type ; its septa
are rather exsert, and are very granular. The costte are very prominent,
ridged, marked with numerous smaU. pits, and are continuous with the septa.
The epitheca is waved and well developed. The spaces between the larger
costse are more or less angular. The peduncle is large.

   Locality. Gault, Folkestone. In the British Museum.

    Variety 2. The corallum is as large as that of variety 1, but it is more
conical. The costse are less pronounced, and the septa, which are more
granular than those of variety 1, arise from the intercostal spaces. The
costal ends are very elegant in shape, and form a margin of rather sharp

curves.

   Locality. Gault, Folkestone. In the British Museum.

    Variety 3. The corallum is rather flat, but hemispherical. The septa are
not exsert, and they arise from the costal ends. The costse are equal : none
are more prominent than others. They are all rather broad, flat, and beau-
tifully ornamented with diverging curved hues. Their free ends are equal
and curved.

   This species is very closely allied to Leptocyatlius elegans, Ed. & H., of the

London Clay. Leptocyatlius elegans has not a flat base, and it has very gra-
nular septa. Moreover, its costae are large and small in sets. Nevertheless

the alliance is of the closest kind.

  MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime described a species of this genus in

their ' Monograph of the British Fossil Corals,' pt. 1. pp. 67, 68. Two spe-

cimens in the collection of the Rev. T. Wiltshire present all the appearances

recognized by those distinguished authors. The costae are very granular, and
not in a simple row. In one specimen the breadth of the base is very great.

Genus Smilotrochus.

   Some species of this genus were described amongst the corals from the
Upper Greensand, and one was noticed as belonging to this geological
horizon which should have been included in the Lower Greensand forms.

   The Upper Greensand Smilotrochi are :

Smilotrochus tuberosus, Ed. ^- H.   Smilotrochus angidatus, Duncan.
        elongatus, Duncan.

   There are four species of the genus found in the Gault, which are all
closely allied : one of them cannot be distinguished from S7nilotrochus elon-
gatus of the Upper Greensand.

   The specimens of this species found in the Upper Greensand are invariably
worn and rolled, and are generally in the form of casts ; but in the Gault the
structural details are well preserved, and even the lateral spines on the septa

are distinct.

   The Gault forms are shorter and more cylindro-conical and curved than
those from the Upper Greensand.

   The species of the genus Smilotrochus from the Gault are as follows :

1. Smilotrochus elongatus, Duncan.  3. Smilotrochus granulatus, Duncan.
2. cylindricus, Duncan.             4. insignis, Duncan.

1. Smilotrochus elongatus, Duncan.
   This species was described in the first Report.

    Locality. Folkestone.

   The lateral spines of the septa are very well marked, and the costas are
equal in size in this species. Its septal number varies, on account of the very

late perfection of the fourth cycle of septa.

2. Stnilotrochus cylindricus, Duncan,
   The corallum is small, cylindrical, nearly straight, and has a truncated

base. The costae are equal, very distinct above, and rudimentary below and
in the middle ; they are marked with a few large granules in one series.
The septa are subequal, very exsert, thin, close, and marked with large
granules, few in number. The septa are in six systems, and there are three

cycles.

   The coralliim is conico-cylindrical in shape, and has a more or less trun-
cated base. The costae are subequal, prominent, very granular, and distinct

superiorly. The septa are subequal, thick, and very granular. The septa

are in six systems, and there are three cycles.

4. Smilotrochus insignis, Duncan.
   The coraUum is trochoid, short, has a wide calice and a conical and

rounded base ; the calice is circular in outline, the fossa is deep and small,
and the septa are wide, exsert, curved above, and so marked with one row of
granules that their free margin appears to be spined. There are three cycles
of septa, and the orders are nearly equal as regards size. The costse are
large, prominent, broad at their base, and are marked with one row of
granules on the free surface.

from the Lower Greensand.

   There is a compoimd or aggregate Madreporarian found in the Gault of
Folkestone. It has much cndotheca, and resembles worn specimens of the
weU-known Holocystis elegmis of the Lower Greensand. The specimens arc
not sufficiently well preserved for identification with any genus.

   The corallum is nearly hemispherical in shape ; its base is flat and ex-
tends beyond the origin of the septa in a sharp and uninverted margin. The

breadth of the base exceeds the height of the corallum. The costae are flat,

straight, convex externally at the calicular margin, and equal. The septa are
unequal, much smaller than the costae. There are four cycles of septa, in six

systems ; tlie synapticulaj between the septa are large.

                                Corals from the Lower Greensand.

   One species of Coral was described by MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules

Haime from the Lower Greensand, in their ' Monograph of the British Fossil

Corals.'

   Fitton had noticed a compound coral in the Lower Greensand, and named

it Astrcea in his " Essay on the Strata below the Chalk," Geol. Trans.
2nd series, vol. iv. p. 352 (1843). In 1847 he called the species Astrcea

elegans; and Lonsdale separated it from the Astrteidce under the name
Ci/athophora elegans in 1849 (Proceed. Geol. Soc. vol. v. pt. 1, p. 83,

tab. iv. figs. 12, 15 : 1849).

   MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime recognized the quadrate arrange-

ment of the septa of this species, and classified it amongst the Rugosa, in
the family Stauridce. Their Holocystis elegans, Eitton, sp., is a very good
species, and specimens are found varying in the size of the corallum and of

the calices.

   MM.Since the publication of their ' Monograi^h on the British Corals,'

Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime have named a species from Farringdon

Smilotrochus Austeni (Hist. Nat. des CoraU. vol. ii. p. 71). I have noticed it

inadvertently in my description of the Upper Greensand Corals. In order to

complete this part it is introduced here again.

    The small TrochosmiUce are common in the Bargate Stone, where they
were discovered by Mr. Meyer, from whom I have obtained the names of
the associated fossils. The presence of epitheca would apparently necessi-
tate these fossils being placed in a new genus ; but after a careful examina-

tion of the bearings of the absence or presence of the epithecal structures

upon the natural classification of simple corals, I do not think the j^oint
sufficiently important to bring about the separation of Mr. Meyer's little
corals from the TrochosmiUce; they form (;'. e. the type and variety) a
subgenus of the TrochosmiUce.

   This small Isastrcea is usually found as a cast, and the restored drawing
is taken from an impression. The central circular structure is due to fos-

   The number of species of Madreporuria in the British Cretaceous forma-

tions is therefore fifty-eight.

   MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime had described twenty-three species

before this Eeport was commenced ; of these I have ventured to suppress
Parasmilia Mantelli, Trochocyatlms Konic/i, and Trochocyathiis Warbiirtoni.

   The coral-fauna of the British area was by no means well developed or
rich in genera during the long period during which the Cretaceous sediments
were being deposited. The coral tracts of the early part of the period were
on the areas now occupied by the Alpine Neocomian strata, and those of the
middle portion of the period were where the Lower Chalk is developed at
Gosau, IJchaux, and Martigues.

    There are no traces of any coral-reefs or atolls in the British Cretaceous
area, and its corals were of a kind whose representatives for the most part
live a depth of from 30 to 600 fathoms.

   An analysis of the work of these authors, with the exception of that of Dr.
Wright, is found scattered over the pages of MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules
Haime's " Monograph of the Oolitic Corals," Pal. Soc. 1851. No new species

of fossil Corals have been described from the Oolitic rock since that date.

During the last year I have added to the species already known five from the

AGreat Oolite, and thirteen from the Inferior Oolite.      careful study of the

251 ThecosniiUce of the Inferior Oolite at Crickley has enabled me to distin-

guish five very remarkable varieties of Thecosmilia gregaria, M'Coy, sp., and

to satisfy myself that the relations of the Thecosmilioi of the Lias to the

genera Isastrcea, Latimceandra, and others were repeated in the Inferior

Oolite. There are specimens of Thecosmilia gregaria in Dr. Wright's collec-

tion which, had I not had a considerable series to examine from other

sources, might have been associated with Reuss's new genus Heterogyra, with

Symphyllia and Latirtiaiandra. The relation of these genera to MontJivcdtia

has been noticed (except Heterogyra) in the first Report (Brit. Assoc. Report,

Norwich, p. 106 et seq.), and there is a clear proof that the same jAenomena
of evolution may occur consecutively. That is to say, the St.-Cassianitfon/Zi-

valtice. and Thecosmilice varied and became permanent, compound, and serial

corals  of  such  genera  as Elysastrcea, Isastrcea, and Latimaiandra                                                                                                                                                                                                                then  the

Liassic Thecosmilice did the same ; and now it is evident that a Montlivaltia

of the Inferior Oolite occasionally took on fissiparous growth, and superadded to
others a marginal gemmation and a serial growth, and evolved forms which

cannot be distinguished from those of the genera above mentioned and Si/m-

phyllia and Heterogyra. There was evidently an inherent power of variation

which declared itself in the same direction during the ages which witnessed

the formation of the St. Cassian and the Liassic and the Lower Oolitic deposits ;
and it is impossible to deny a genetic value to these oft-repeated structural

phenomena.
   One of the Thecosmilice from the Inferior Oolite at Crickley, which I have

named T. Wrighti, is very closely allied to the Lower-Liassic species.

    It is interesting to find the genus C'ycloJites represented in the Inferior
Oolite by two well-marked species, one of which is like the rest of the forms
of the genus in shape, and the other is exceptional in its trochoid form. This
last species has, however, all the characteristics of the genus. The Cyclolites
are extinct ; they flourished in the Lower Cretaceous seas, and lasted during

the Miocene. MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime (Hist. Nat. des Corall.)

mention that the genus originated in the Jurassic age, but they give no evi-

dence. The species now under consideration are, however, clearly from the

Inferior Oolite.

   A form belonging to a new genus of the Fimr/idce was found by Mr,

Mansel at East Coker in the Inferior Oolite. In general shape and the

arrangement of the calices the specimen resembles Bhnorjyhastrcea ; but the
synapticulae between the septa and costee necessitate its association with the

Fungidce. There is a central calice, and the others are in a circle around it,
being separated by long horizontal septo-costal prolongations ; the whole
is surrounded by an epitheca, and forms a turbinate shape, the free surface
being flat and circular. The genus foreshadows the genera Cyaihoseris and
Troehoseris of the Lower Chalk.

   There are several new species of the genus Thamnastraa ; T. Browni, nobis

(MS. sp.), is remarkable for having in some specimens a long stalk surmounted
by a knob-shaped head. The calices are small on the stalk, and A'ery large
on the head ; so that when the form is examined before it is mature, there is
a danger of producing two species instead of one. The stalk often attains the
height of 3 or 4 inches. In other specimens there is no stalk, and the knob-

shaped corallum is sessile.

  A large specimen of Thamnastrc^a Manseli (MS. sp.). Inferior Oolite, is

pedunculate, short, and verj' expanded superiorly ; the epitheca is weU pre-

served, and the endothecal dissepiments can be seen. This is a very satisfac-
tory species, and I have had it very carefully drawn, so that the suspiciously

synapticular endotheca can be proved to be really dissepimental.

  A specimen of Cladopliyllia Baheana, d'Orb., sp., figured in the inedited
plates of the PalaBontographical Society at my instance, is remarkable from the

disposition of the corallites to combine and form serial and fissiparous calices

as in Thecosmilia.

   The new species of the genera Cyathophora and Isastrcea are well marked,

and that of the last is a dendroid form.

   Mr. Walton has forwarded me Zeplirentis ? TFrtZ^ont, Ed. & H., from the
Inferior Oolite at Dundiy, which MM. Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime felt

inclined to think was a remanie fossil. There is no doubt about the specimen
being a Ze^jhrentis, and it is clear that it was derived from an older rock, just as

the Carboniferous corals mixed up with the Lower-Lias corals were.

     I can add the following species to the list of Oolitic fossil corals, and most

of them have been figured, but are not yet published (in 6 plates of the Pal.

to reefs and atolls, and do not represent those bathymetrical states which the

deep-sea coral-fauna is not found amongst the relics of the Oolites, and the

milia gregaria are not mentioned or considered as species, although they have a verv fair

forms peculiarizing the reefs are positively aggregated in an upper and lower
mass at Crickley on the Inferior Oolitic beds.

    Dr. Wright noticed some years since* an Oolitic coral-reef near Frith
Quarry, on the northern sjiur of Brown's Hill, about two miles from Stroud.
There is a corresponding reef on the ojjposite side of the valley, the whole of
the intervening space having been excavated by denudation. The coral-bed
consists of large masses of coralline limestone imbedded in a fine-grained
cream-coloured mudstone. The corals are in a highly crystalline state, so that
the genera and species are determined with difficulty. The bed is from 1.5 to
20 feet in thickness, and forms one of the finest examples of fossil coral-reefs

that Dr. Wright is acquainted with in the district. The bed may be traced

along the escarpment, in a north-westerly direction, for several miles, to

Witcomb and Crickley on the west, and to near Cubberley and Cowley on
the east, where it was worked several years ago. Judging from the thick-
ness of the bed, and the abundance of corals it contains, it must have formed
a barrier reef of considerable magnitude in the Jurassic sea. The following
is a section showing the relative position of the Lower Coral-reef.

    The Middle Coral-bed is included in the Oolite Marl, and in some localities
as at Frith, Leckhampton, Sheepscombe, and others, it contains masses of

corals.

    The Upper Coral-reef occupies the horizon of the upper Trigonia Grit, and
is very well exposed in many sections. That of Cleeve Hill has yielded the
best corals. The following section is oj^en near Frith. Ascending the bank
above this quarry for a short distance some fields of arable land are jjassed
over, on which are several heaps of the Upper Eagstones, with Trigonia cos-
tata, Grijphcva subloha, and other shells of the higher zone. Walking in the
direction of i\\e Grove, after passing over the summit of the hill and descend-

ing a short distance, a good section of the upper reef may be seen in the

Slad ^'alley.

   The remarkable varieties of Thecosmilia gregaria, which resemble the genus
Si/mj)JtyIIia and Beterogyra, are found principally in the lower reef, but they
exist in the upper also. ISome species appear to be peculiar to the different reefs,
but it is unsafe to form lists at present. There is evidently a considerable
afhuity between the faunas of the reefs, and there is nothing to indicate any-
thing more than a temjiorary absence from, and a return of the species to an

area.

   The corals of the Great Oolite are found in the Upper Eagstones underly-
ing the Bradford Clay. ISfear Bath large masses of CalamophyUia radiata are
associated with the roots, stems, and heads of Apiocrinites rotunclus, Mill.,
which flourished like a miniature forest on the reef, and luxuriated amongst
the polypes uutil the clear water was invaded by a current charged with mud,
which destroyed the Ennrinites and the Corals alsot.

--164 REPORT 1869.

"The irregular beds of Polyparia consist of nodules or masses of crys-

tallized carbonate of lime, which afford, invariably, evidences of the labours

of the Polypus ; and associated with them are othei's of earthy limestone,

which bear only partial proofs of an organic origin. The whole are con-

nected by a pale bluish or yellowish stiff clay. It happens frequently that

a bed is composed of one genus of Polyparia."

In Yorkshire the Coralline Oolite is well developed, and several reefs are

found at Hackness, Ayton, Seamer, &c. John Leckenby, Esq., F.G.S., of

--Scarborough, gives the following details (see Dr. Wright, op. cit.)

" In various parts of the district occupied by the Coralline Oolite around

Scarborough are found patches of coral-reef sometimes occupying an area

of fully an acre ; and although never attaining an altitude so high as the

beds on the inclined surfaces of which they rest, they are truly the uppermost

beds of the formation.

" They are sometimes from 10 to 15 feet in thickness, and consist of a

series of layers of crystallized coral from 18 to 24 inches in thickness, of the

species Tliamnastrcea concinna, Goldf. (which is the T. micraston, Phillips),

each layer being separated by rubbly clay and mud, in all probability being

the decomposition of each successive reef. The rock is quarried to supply

material for repairing the roads of the district ; but it is by no meains so well

adapted for the purpose as the adjacent calcareous grit, which, at the cost of

a Httle additional labour, would furnish a material much more durable. The

crystalline coral-reef is quickly ground to powder, and its use affords less

satisfaction to the traveller than to the geologist, as the blocks which are

stored up for use along the sides of the road yield many a handsome specimen

to adorn his collection.

" The largest deposit is near the village of Ayton : there are others not

quite so extensive; one near the village of Seamer, another close to the

hamlet of Irton, and others in the neighbourhood of Wykeham and Prompton

--the intervening distances being about a mile in every case."

   Messrs. Leckenby and Cullen visited the coral-reefs of the Coralline Oolite

near Scarborough with Dr. Wright, who writes as foUows :
   " One quarry, near Ayton, wliich may be considered as a type of the others,

consisted of masses of crystalline coralline limestone, the beds having an

irregular undulating appearance. The corals appear to have grown in areas

of depression of the coralline sea ; the rock consists of largo masses of highly

crystalline limestone, forming nodulated eminences and concave curves, in

beds of from 12 to 18 inches in thickness, having a stratum of yellowish clay

filling up the hollows, and forming a horizontal line again to the stratification
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

then follows another stratum of crystaUine limestone, which assumes the

same nodulated condition as the one below it, the siirface of the coral

masses, where exposed, showing that the whole is almost entirely composed

of a small-celled Astraa, Th/imnastnea concinna, Goldf., Micraston, Phillips,

in some altered condition                                                                                                        the reef is exposed to about 10 feet in section, and
                                                                                                                              ;

rests on another, forming the floor of the quarry, and which descends many

feet deeper ; the corals arc bored by GaatrocTuence, and numerous shells were
seen imbedded in the coral mass, which had nestled in the crannies of the

reef."

Dr. Wright sums up with regard to the French, German, and British strata

of the Etage Corallieu as follows :

   " From this general view of the geographical distribution of the Coralline
zone, it would appear that this formation was composed of a series of coral-

reefs in the Jurassic sea, which, during the period of their construction, occu-

pied a large portion of the region now constituting the soil of modern

Europe ; and that the bed of the Jurassic sea was a slowly subsiding area of

great extent, like many parts of the Coral Sea in the Indo-Pacific Ocean of

our day"*.
   The restriction of species to very definite areas, and to limited zones amongst

these succeeding coral-reefs, is veiy remarkable, and, as was noticed to occur
in the Lias, the corals are occasionally persistent, and are associated -with
different moUuscan species. But the physico-geological changes which pro-
duced new reefs must have been preceded by considerable geographical changes,
for, as a rule, the species of the grand divisions of the Jurassic system are
different. Thecosmilia Wrightl of the lower reef of the Inferior Oolite has
considerable resemblance to the ThecosmiU.ce of the Inferior Lias ; but no
Liassic species pass upwards into the Oolites. Only four species are com-

mon to the Inferior and Great Oolites, and one to the Coral Rag and Great

Oolite yet there was a succession of the physico-geographical conditions
                                      ;

favourable for the formation of reefs on the same area. The existence of
reefs in so high a latitude during the Oolitic period, and their formation by
polypes whose genera were all extinct during the early Cainozoic period, but
which are clearly represented by allied genera in the existing reefs, are very
suggestive. These were the last reefs of the British area ; for there are no
traces of agglomeration of reef-building genera in the Lower Greensand, the
Gault, Upper Greensand, Chalk, or Tertiary formations. The nearest approach
to a reef must have been in the Lower Oligocene period, when the Tabulate
corals and Solenastrcett of Brockenhurst formed a small outlier of the European
coral sea of the time between the Nummulitic age and the lowest Falunian

deposits.

   The succession of reefs and deep-sea or littoral coral conditions appears
to have been as follows on the British area south of Yorkshire, after the
termination of the Permian period :

   The reefs were doubtless developed on areas where depression and eleva-
tion of the sea-bottom was constant, and where old rocks were occasionally
sufficiently near the surface to afford a nidus for reef-species. The depths
around these rocks must have been considerable ; there could not have been
any large bodies of fresh water near, and the sea-water must have been
pure and in constant motion. The littoral corals resembled the CarjiophylUa
Smithi of our coasts in bathj'metrical distribution, and the deep-sea corals,
like the existing CarijophijUia borealis and Loplwhelia prolifera, were simple
solitary forms distributed at a depth of from 30 to 600 or more fathoms.

    The British reefs of the early Secondary period were not necessarily

situated in a tropical climate ; for there is no reason why reef-building corals

shoidd not have been able to exist and multiply in the same temperature

of sea-water that deep-sea corals now do. The deep-sea corals are abun-
dant between Norway and the Shetlands, and are quite out of the range of
the Gulf-stream. The Bermuda reefs are dependent upon the Gulf-stream
for the supply of sufficiently warm water to produce the development of
ova. It may have happened that the early Secondary species may not have

required a greater amount of sea-temperature than that in which the great
coral caUed Bendrophi/lUa ramea flourishes off Cadiz. These facts and
considerations must have some weight against the argument that, because
all existing reefs are tropical, all former reefs must have been so.

    If the area of Europe is compared with that of Great Britain during the

periods that have elapsed since the Palfeozoic epoch, the distribution of reefs
and centres of oscillation, and of deep-sea and littoral corals indicating very

stationary conditions, gives a very good idea of the successive physico-

geographies of the old seas.

                                                    western seas of Europe.

   The Miocene reefs were in Sonth France, Italy, Spain, and Germany,
where thei-e were also deep-sea and littoral species.

   The seas of Europe and Great Eritain during the period of the Middle
and Upper Lias were most uucoralliferous, and also during the deposit of
the Gault. On the other hand, there were reef and atoll seas during the
deposition of the sediments of the zone of A. angulatns and hisiilcatiis of the
Lower Lias, of the Inferior and Great Oolite, and of the Oligocene.

   The European area was more or less a centre of oscillation and of reef-
formation during the Triassic and the Lower-Liassic periods, duiing the Lower-
Oolitic periods, and from the Neocomian to the end of the Miocene, inclu-
sive of these periods. There was a great change in the depth of the seas
and of the physico-geographical conditions after the formation of the deposits
containing A. Biu:Mandi, and a second change produced the reefs of the
Oolites. Again, the deposits of the Portland Oolite and the Gault were pre-
ceded and followed by gTeat bathymetrical changes.

   The changes on the British area were before the Lower Lias and after it,
after the Great Oolite and Coral Rag, and after the Eocene and before the
Crag. Whilst the European area was coraUiferous in the Trias, the British
area was uucoralliferous ; and whilst the Cretaceous reefs of Western Europe
flourished, the British area was characterized by deep-sea and littoral corals.
The lines and curves which may be drawn to explain these variations in
the two areas are as follows * :

   The reef-areas of the Upper Lias and Gault have yet to be discovered.
   It is very remarkable that the Tabulate corals, which were so abundant
in the Palajozoic Coral-fauna, and which constitute whole reefs at the pre-

sent time, should not be represented in the British Secondary Coral-fauna.
The first trace of them is found in the Eocene beds. The perforate corals,

omitting the Eungidte, which are not included in them by MM. Milne-Edwards

and Jules Haime, are imknown in the Secondary rocks of Great Britain,

yet they form masses of existing reefs, and were sebundant in the Oligocene.
One of the class, i. e. the Protarcea vetusta, appeared in the Lower Silurian
formation of Ohio ; but the class was not apparently represented on our

area until the Eocene, if we except the Microsolenas, which are very ex-
ceptional perforate forms of the Oolites. The absence of these forms must be

accounted for by the deficiency of the geological record.

          ON ICE AS AN AGENT OF GEOLOGIC CHANGE.  171

Report of the Committee appointed to get cut and prepared Sections
   of Mountain- Limestone Corals for Photographing. The Committee

   consists 0/ Henry Woodward^ F.G.S., Dr. Duncan, F.R.S., Pro-

   fessor Harkness, F.R.S., and James Thomson, F.G.S. (Reporter).

The operations of this Committee have been carried on indefatigably during
the past year ; the results are very promising, but much additional work

must be performed before any satisfactory conclusions can be arrived at.

   "VVe have cut several hundred sections, but many of them have been so

crushed and fractured, that they are absolutely useless for our purpose

thus in one lot of eighty-seven we found only two specimens sufficiently per-

fect to be of any use ; this is to be regretted, as it is desirable to select as
perfect specimens as possible for photographing, and also for the use of Dr.
Duncan for describing in the Transactions of the Palseontological Society.

    Those cut, and partly cut, consist of the following genera : Cyathophyllum,

Cyclojjhi/llum, CUsiophyllum, and allied forms, LonsdaVia, Zephrentis, Am-

plencu^, Michelinia, i^yringojjora, Lithostrotion and its varieties.

    The time and labour involved in superintending the cutting, examining,
and finishing those which are sufficiently perfect, will explain the impossibi-
lity of producing this year so complete a set as we could have wished.

However, we have been sufficiently successful to warrant us in saying that
with those made, and others in readiness to make, we wiU be able to produce

in another year a very full set of plates.

   With the plates already finished we have been trying a number of experi-
ments in photography ; finding that by the usual process the colour fades by
exposure to light, we went to Newcastle and examined Mr. Swan's carbon
process ; and, being satisfied that it was an improvement, we left three plates
with him, and we now exhibit the results, satisfactory in two of them, while
the other has some defects ; we are, however, in hopes that soon we wiU be
able to produce fac-similes on zinc or copper plates. Mr. Swan has been

trying experiments for that purpose, and he is in hopes of being successfid.

If so, we will be able to produce them in any number, and at such a mode-

rate price that they will be available for ordinary publishing purposes. If

not successful, we expect to be able, by the carbon process, to produce sets
of plates which wiU. be placed in a few of the principal Museums when com-

pleted.

Report on Ice as an Agent of Geologic Change. By a Committee,

   consisting of Professor Otto Torell, Professor Ramsay, LL.D.,
   F.R.S., and H. Bauerman, F.G.S. (Reporter).

We are of opinion that the work already done in the investigation of the

phenomena connected with ice is not sufficient to enable us to prepare a
Keport showing the precise effect of " ice as an agent of geologic change ;"
but enough has been done to show in part the manner in which the subject

may be followed, for the purpose of obtaining information as to the quanti-

tative action of glaciers, both as regards their erosive and transporting

powers.

WeFirst.  would select a well-known glacier-region, such as the Alps,

and there for preliminary investigation fix on a large glacier, simple in

structure and easily accessible, such, for example, as the lower glacier of the
--173 REPORT 18G9.

Aar. If not already done, the glacier and the surrounding mountains ought
to be well surveyed and mapped, and its moraines clearly expressed.

   Secondly. The amount of rocky and earthy matter forming each medial
and lateral moraine would require to be determined as accurately as possible,
probably in the manner illustrated by the accompanying rough diagram of
an imaginary glacier.

   Take of the medial moraine marked a a space, say, from 100 to 500 yards in
length, and estimate the solid contents of that portion of the moraine. This
should be done as near as possible to the place where the medial moraine is
formed by the union of the two lateral moraines x and 3/; for lower down part

of the material may disappear by falling into crevasses. The same must be

places, for the lateral moraines d and e. Then ascertain the rates of the

monward movement of the glacier, according to circumstances, various por-

tions of its length, and at various seasons of the year ; and by these means

wlU be ascertained to a great extent (but not precisely) the quantity of

matter carried annually on the surface of the glacier to its termination, and

this matter will represent a very large part of the waste of the sides of the

mountains that bound the snow and glacier basins o, p, q, and the sides of
the mountains that bound the glacier lower down towards its terminal

moraine.

Thirdly. The chief part of the remainder of the rocky and earthy matter

that is carried from the mountains to the level of the glacier will pass under

it at its sides, and mingle with the material that finds its way to the bottom

of the glacier through the means of crevasses and moulins, and also with

that which is the product of the erosive action of the glacier exerted on

Aits bed and on the stone blocks imprisoned at the bottom of the ice.

small part of the above-named remainder may also be caught in the ice and

imprisoned in rejoined crevasses.

WeFourthly.           see no way of precisely estimating the amount of erosion
--produced by the weight and movement of the glacier that is to say, the

rate at which any given glacier may deepen and widen its valley by pure

wearing action, owing to the circumstance that the sediments discharged

along with the water that flows from the end of a glacier do not represent

the amount produced by mere erosive force, for the reason stated under

head 3. But it is essential to the main question that correct estimates
should be made of the amount of solid matter brought from under the glacier

by the help of running water, and also of the amount carried away by the

continual wasting by streams of the terminal moraine.

As regards the matter in suspension in the river, and also that forced

along its bottom, it should be estimated, if possible, at a point r, just below

where the various streams unite that flow from the ends of most great gla-

ciers. Where there is only one stream (as in the Aletsch glacier), the closer

to the glacier the better.          The  operation  would  be      very  laborious                                         for,  unless
                                                                                                                        ;

frost and snow prevented it, it would requii'e to be done for every daj' in a

year or years, and several times each day, at least in summer and autumn,

and probably in spring and winter also. For example, in summer the quan-

tity of water varies largely, according to the heat of various periods of the

day                   and it would  probably be necessary to make  an  observation                                         every day
                   ;

before sunrise, another some time before noon, another between four and six

o'clock in the afternoon, and another after nightfall ; in fact sufficiently

often to obtain an average for each day in the year.

AVith rgard to the transport of heavier matter from the terminal moraine

(which forms a portion of this part of the subject) by the glacier-streams

that waste it, an index to the amount may approximately be obtained by

means of the estimates indicated under head 2, assuming that all terminal

moraines are formed chiefly from matter transported on the sm-face of the

glacier.

   Other methods involving special study on the spot would be required for
the terminal and lower side-moraines of such glaciers as those of La Brenva

and Miage, which on the sides that face up the valley towards the Lake of
Comballe are still growing.

   Fifthly. If the foregoing methods are correct, they might afterwards be
applied to all the glaciers of the Alps, and the rate of waste and transport

by glacier- action might be approximately determined ; and in like manner
--174 REPORT 1869.

they might also be used for well-kuown and comparatively accessible moim-

tain-ranges like the Scandinavian chain, the Himalaya, the mountains of
'New Zealand, and in time to the Eocky Mountains, the Andes, and others.

    Sixthli/. Eut the above only forms part of the subject, and to attempt to
estimate the existing importance of " ice as an agent of geologic change,"
the glacier and glacial phenomena generally as regards erosion and terrestrial
and marine transport of material must be taken into account in such regioi:is
as Spitzbergen, Greenland, and Victoria Land in the soiithern hemisphere.

Something on a small scale may be done in Spitzbergen and the southern
part of Greenland ; but at present we see no likelihood of definite observa-
tions being made on the western side of Greenland further north, and in the

extreme north of that continent, or on its eastern shores, either in respect to
the erosion produced by its great glaciers, the effect of iloe and shore-ice, or
the transporting work done by the icebergs that float southwards from its

shores.

    Something is known of the general results, but it seems very improbable,
with regard to the number and size of icebergs, and the quantity of matter

they bear southwards, that anything definite is likely to be ascertained at

present. The same remarks bear yet more strongly on the glacial pheno-
mena of Victoria Land.

   Seventlihj. But when so much remains to be done on the Alps and on

other accessible mountain-areas, such difficult points can aftbrd to wait for

the present ; and we are of opinion that perhaps it is possible, after the sub-

ject has been investigated with regard to the existing glaciers of the Alps, to
apply approximately the same method to the older extension of the Alpine

glaciers during the last glacial period, and to invent a process by which we
may be able in some degree to estimate the amount of erosive waste, and of

transport of moraine matter on the surface, of the great glaciers of that
epoch. Accurate surveys of the old moraines of that epoch would be essen-
tial to this end, such, for example, as that of the great moraine of Ivrea. The
extent of the glacier has been shown by Gastaldi, and the area occupied by,
and cubic contents of, the moraine must be estimated : and if it be possible
to feel our way towards the data, attempts must be made to estimate the
amount of waste of the moraine going on at the time it was deposited by the
streams flowing from the end of the glacier. Numerous other considerations
arise from this extended view of the question, one of which is, that perhaps

it may be applied to other glaciated regions where glaciers no longer exist,

such as the Vosges, the Black Forest, Wales, the north of England, Scotland,

--ifec, thus : Given an area such as the Alps and the Lowlands of Switzer-

land, covered with glacier-ice ; if an approximate estimate can be formed of
the amount of waste sutfered by that land due to glacier- action, so under
like circumstances is it possible more or less accurately to estimate the
 amount of erosions and other waste suflPered by an equal area in such a terri-
tory as the north of Greenland at the present day.

    In conclusion, any qualified person, with proper assistance and time at his
disposal, could undertake the preliminary work on a single glacier ; but to do
 what is necessary to complete it for such an area as the Alps would probably

involve national scientific cooperation.
           EXPERIMENTS ON THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF IRON. 175

 Provisional Report of a Committee consisting of Professor Tait, Pro-

    fessor Tyndall, and Dr. Balfour Stewart^ appointed for the
    purpose of repeating Principal J. D. Forres's Experiments on the
    Thermal Conductivity of Iron, and of extending them to other Metals.

   By Professor Tait.

In consequence of a misunderstanding, the standard thermometers ordered

from the Kew Observatory did not arrive in time to be employed in the ex-

periments hitherto made, so that the results now to be stated, besides being

only approximate, are, for the most part, confined to a range of temperature
 of about 100° C. merely. Before the next meeting of the British Association
the whole question will have been reexamined with far superior instruments

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

but with such thermometers as I had at hand (including some of those used
by Principal Forbes, of wlaich, however, I have not succeeded in obtaining
the corrections determined by Welsh at Kew), results have been obtained of

a character sufficiently definite for publication, though, of course, subject to
(slight) future corrections and perhaps limitations.

   The substances experimented on were iron, lead, and copper. Two spe-

cimens of the latter metal were employed, one of high, the other of low
electric conductivity, the resistances of equal lengths of wires of the same
gauge being about 1 to 1-64. The ratio of the thermal conductivities of
these bars was at once found to be within 5 per cent., the same as that of
their electric conductivities, a result certainly anticipated, but stiU very
striking. In specific gravity and specific heat, as well as in chemical com-
position, mode of manufacture, and drawing, these bars of copper scarcely
differ. As yet they have been treated for thermal conductivity in the hard-
drawn state alone ; but annealed wires of the same materials, while showing
a slightly improved electric conductivity, maintain towards one another a

ratio practically unaltered.

   Two points have been observed which enable us materially to simplify the

determination of thermal conductivities by Torbes's method, so long at least

as moderate ranges of temperature are concerned ; and we seek no greater

accuracy than admits of 1 or 2 per cent, of error.
    1. The Curve of Cooling is practically the same for aU the substances I

have tried (even for gas-coke), merely foreshortened or elongated in terms of
a parameter, which involves the product of the specific gravity and the spe-
cific heat of the substance employed. This was, of course, to be expected,
provided the radiating power of the surface be kept the same, and provided
conductivity do not interfere with the results.

   2. The Curve of Statical Temperature possesses, practically, the same pro-

perty, at least for the four different bars employed. This proves that within
the range of the experiments, and subject to the errors of the thermometers,
the law of change of thermal conductivity with temperature is the same for
lead and copper as for iron. I showed (Proc. R. S. Edin., 1867-68) that
Forbes's results for iron agree closely with the statement that the conduc-
tivity is inversely as the absolute temperature, a result which is identical
with Matthiessen's determinations of electric resistance of pure metals at

different temperatures. With a view to foUow up this analogy still further,
I have ordered a bar of German silver, a substance whose electric conduc-
tivity is but little altered by temperature. The results cannot fail to be

interesting.

    Very simple reasoning from the (plotted) curves of Cooling and of Statical
f^mperature shows that, to the amount of accuracy before mentioned, the
176 REPORT--1869.

thermal conductivities of two metals are as the squares of the foreshorienings

myin their respective curves of statical temperature. I have not considered

observations sufficiently exact (chiefly on account of the imperfection of the

thermometers) to warrant my undertaking the labour of calculating the con-

stants of empirical formulae to represent them, but have contented myself
with results derived from tracing, libera manu, curves closely representing
the result of experiment.

   I may mention, in concluding this provisional Report, that an air-bath has

been found preferable to melted solder for heating the bars employed in the

cooling experiments, and that the conductivity of copper is so much superior
to that of iron that, when a source of heat above 100° C. is employed, the

further ends of the 8-feet copper bars require to be kept cold by a constant
stream of water. In this case the curve of statical temperature undergoes
an ob^aous and easiLv allowed for modification.

In the last Eeport it was stated that several small hardy maximum ther-

mometers suited for rough work were being constructed by Casella under the
direction of the Committee. These instruments have now been in use for a

--year and have been found to work well.
   Their construction is as follows: APhiUips's maximum thermometer, about

10 inches long, graduated in Fahr. degrees from about 30° to 90°, is her-
metically sealed within a glass tube, which is about three-quarters filled with
air and one-fourth with alcohol, the thermometer being kept from touching
the tube by cork rings. The thermometer thus enclosed is inserted in a
copper case for protection, contact between the glass and the copper being
prevented by india-rubber. The air within the hermetically sealed tube
prevents the great pi-essure which acts upon the exterior of the tube in deep
bores fiUed with water from being transmitted to the thermometer within.
The use of the alcohol is to lessen the time required for the thermometer to
come to the temperature of the surrounding medium.

   The Committee would take this opportunity of stating that they will be
happy to supply these instruments to any persons who wiU undertake to make

observations of the tempei'ature in borings.

    In regard to these observations, I have to remark that the thermometer
had to be drawn up with great caution, as I found that the thermometer
case, or a knot on the cord, meeting -with a slight obstruction from rugged
parts of the bore, produced a sufficient shock to cause the detached portion of
the mercury to sink, which rendered the observation useless. The discre-

pancies in some of the observations marked (?) may be due to this cause.
In several cases, when the shock was distinctly felt, I found the reading very

--low, and at once rejected it.
   The mode of procedure was as as follows : the readings were taken gene-
rally at intervals of 60 feet (10 fathoms). For the smaller depths iced water
was used to set the thermometer below the temperature of the locality to be
tested, and on being brought to the surface, it was put into the water while
taking the reading for considerable depths ; this was unnecessary, as its

passage through the colder upper strata served the purpose sufficiently. Fre-
quently two observations were taken at one depth in succession, but never
more, before proceeding to the next greater ; and in no case was a reading

taken at any depth after one had been made at a lower on the same day.
    Between the depths 390 feet and 450 feet there is continuous shale, and I

thought it might be interesting to have the temperature of both these localities.
   At the depth of 488 feet commences a bed of greenstone about 140 feet thick,

but the sediment prevented me from getting more than 37 feet into this bed.

   As it would be interesting to get through the greenstone, I am at present
making inquiries as to the expense of having the mud pumped out.

   * As regards the relation between rate of increase of temperature do-wnwards and
thermal conductivity, it is to be borne in mind that in comparing different parts of one

bore these quantities ai-e generally in inverse proportion to each other ; but this rule does
not apply to the comparison of two bores in different localities. See Mr. Hopkins's paper,
Phil. Trans, vol. cxlvii.

of increase, calculated from the observations in August and September, is
0°-0187 per foot, or 1° for 53-5 feet.

   This is the bore which was referred to in the following passage of last

year's Eeport.
    " It has been selected because the mining engineer states in his report

that the coal has been very much burned or charred, showing the effects of

heat ; and it becomes an interesting question, Are there any remains of that
heat that charred the coal in ancient times, or has it passed off so long ago

that the strata are now not sensibly warmer on account of it ? "
   The observations seem to establish the latter alternative, this bore being

rather colder than its neighbour, the Blythswood No. 1.

   Mr. Q. J. Symons, Member of the Committee, has furnished the following
account of observations taken by him to the depth of 1 100 feet in an artesian
boring at Kentish Town :

   " Observations have been made during a considerable length of time, and
with every precaution and care, through the London Clay, Thanet Sands,
Chalk, Upper Greeusand, and Gault, in the vicinity of the metropolis, under

the following circumstances.

   " There exists in the northern suburbs of London, between Kentish Town

and Highgate, a remarkably large well, 8 feet in diameter and 540 feet deep,
lined throughout with the finest brickwork, and reaching 214 feet deep into
the Chalk. This well was the property of a Company whose Act of Parlia-
ment bore date 35th Henry VIII. (a.d. 1544), and afforded a sujjply of
water to the surrounding neighbourhood until, in 1852, when, under the

joint influence of the Board of Health, who objected to hard water, of in-
creasing demand and decreasing quantity, the Company decided on seeking
a fresh supply. It was represented to them as most probable that by sink-
ing a bore-tube to a depth of about 1000 feet, the Lower Greensand would be
tapped, and an abundant supply of excellent water obtained. The then
existing well being more than half the entire depth required, it was decided
to bore from its bottom, and thus save half the cost. The boring was carried
down to 1302 feet (nearly a quarter of a mile), but the Lower Greensand was
absent ; some unknown rocks were penetrated, and the Company, after spend-

ing on their works, well, and boring nearly £100,000, became bankrupt

the New River Company purchased the plant, but were advised not to con-

tinue the search ; the buildings were sold for old materials, and the whole

left in a ruinous condition.

    " I considted other members of this Committee as to the expediency of ob-

taining from the New River Comp. permission to experiment on this bore, and

consent having (through the courtesy of Mr. Muir, the Company's engineer)
been obtained, it was decided that observations should be forthwith commenced.

    " Owing to the ruinous condition of the top of the well, and the depth of
the top of the bore-tube below the ground, very considerable danger and

discomfort attended the preliminary arrangements, although these very dif-

ficulties have eventually led to the detection of sources of error not previously

suspected, and to exceptionally accurate results.
    " The accompanying sketches explain pretty clearly the exact circumstances

under which the observations were taken, viz. that a hut was erectied over

 the top of the well to shut out, as far as practicable, external temperature

 and to protect the apparatus ; that a stout floor was fixed 10 feet down the
weU to afford access to the tube * and safety to the observer, the top of the

ground, and passes down through the well."

felt to prevent external air having free communication with the tube. The

depth at which water stands in the tube : this constancy is worth notice ; for
whereas in most cases water-levels vary with the rainfall in the districts

whence they obtain their supply, the water at Kentish Town has not varied
more than six inches during the last ten months, and is very muddy. The

diameter of the bore-tube is 8 inches.

 --Two thermometers have always been used in these observations, one

similar to those designed for the use of the Committee by Sir Wm. Thomson,

and the other an extra strong Six's thermometer, as supplied to the Admi-
ralty by Casella. The iniiuence of great pressure on the indications of ther-

mometers having recently attracted considerable attention, it may be well to
state that the greatest pressure to which those used at Kentish Town have

been submitted is about a fifth of a ton per square inch, and this causes the

Six's thermometer to rise about 0°-4 ; Sir W. Thomson's thermometer being

protected by an outer glass tube is entirely uninfluenced by this pressure, or
even, as Professor Miller's experiments have shown, by a pressure of two tons
and a half on the square inch*. Hence it is certain that pressure has been
deprived of aU influence. The use of two thermometers of diff'erent con-
structions ensured the detection of any slipping or accidental error in the
observations, but in the regular series not a single instance of the kind has

occurred.

    " In order to ascertain the depth of the instruments easily, accurately, and
independently of any variation in the hygrometric condition of the lowering-
cord, it was conducted from the windlass round a grooved wheel exactly
86 inches in circumference, to whose axle an endless screw was attached,
which worked a train of divided wheels, so that the exact distance could
be taken at any instant.

    " It was supposed that several trustworthy obsei'vations could be obtained
in the course of one day ; but the following Table shows that this was not
the case, and confirms the expediencj-, where practicable, of allowing con-
siderable time for the instruments &c. to come to thermal equilibrium. At

Kentish Town the observations on which reliance is placed have been made
at intervals of not less than six days, and generally of seven. On two or
three occasions, however, attempts have been made to obtain observations at

short intervals, and the following are the results:

   " It is well knoTvn that in the solid crust of the earth the influence of sea-

sons penetrates but a slight depth, say 60 feet ; but it occurred to me that
this might not hold good in the case of such an opening as the Kentish Town
well. I therefore decided on commencing my observations at midwinter,

contiuuiug them regularly to midsummer, and then repeating every obser-

vation ; those at each depth will therefore have been taken twice at exactly

opposite seasons, and at intervals of six months. The necessity for this

extreme care did not appear obvious at first, and it seemed as if the various

precautions against the ingress of atmospheric temperatures had rendered it

superfluous ; but during recent hot periods its desirability has become abun-

dantly manifest : the temperature at a depth of 50 feet was 49°-2 in Janu.ary

and 54°-l in July ;  that  at 100 feet was    51° in January and                                                        54°-3 in July
                                                                                                                                                                            ;

at 150 feet 52°-! in January and 54°-7 in July. It is therefore evident that

under the cii'cumstances existing at Kentish Town, it is more easy to deter-

mine accurately the temperature at great depths than at the lesser ones. It

is certain that but for the precautions taken, and the unusual mildness of the

winter, the temperature at 50 feet would have been much below 49°-2.

Whence it further appears that though a single observation at depths below

200 feet will probably give accurately the true temperature at any selected

depth, yet in shafts and bores similarly circumstanced to that now under

notice, very discordant residts may be obtained at lesser depths. Moreover,

it is obviously impossible, bj' anj' but long-continued observations, to deter-

mine accurately the surface-temperature of the ground, or the equivalent of

a depth of feet ; it may therefore be expedient, for the purpose of com-

pleting the series, to assume that the mean temperature of

the surface of the soil at Kentish Town, 187 feet above mean

sea-level, is identical with that of the air at Green'ndch (49°)

at 159 feet above the sea, and it is satisfactory to find that

the observations hitherto made agree perfectly with this

hypothesis. Although, as we have already stated, the ex-

periments are by no means concluded, it may be convenient

to tabulate the results hitherto obtained. Being impressed

with the high importance of accurate knowledge of the

rate and amount of seasonal change in the shaft, Mr. Symons

designed, and Mr. Casella (aided in part by Messrs. Silver &

ON UNDERGKOUND TEMPERATUKE.  187

    " Assuming 49° as the surface-temperature, and adopting 70° as the tem-

perature at 1100 feet, we find, for the mean rate of increase downwards,

·0191° per foot, or 1° for 52-4 feet.
    " Comparing the first observation in the water (56°) with the temperature

at the bottom (70°), the mean rate of increase comes out -0165, or 1° for

60-6 feet.

    " During the remainder of the present year the repetition of the observa-
tions will be continued, and it is hoped the influence of seasonal changes will

be measured and eliminated. In conclusion, we have to acknowledge the
liberality of the New Eiver Company in allowing Mr. Symons unreserved

access to their grounds, and permission to erect the necessary apparatus,
which has been efficiently protected by their servants. "

    I desire to say, in reference to the foregoing Report, that the length of

time which Mr. Symons found it necessary to interpose between his observa-
tions is a peculiar circumstance of which I can at present off'er no sufficient
explanation, and I cannot help thinking that it might be obviated by some
modification of the arrangements. Mr. M'Farlane, in three different bores,
has found 15 minutes amply sufficient to give the correct temperature. Can
the difference be owing to the greater size and smoothness of the bore in this

instance off'ering less resistance to vertical currents ?

    As regards the first 210 feet, being the portion occupied by air, it is not

siu'prising that the influence of season should here be perceptible, seeing

that the well is 8 feet in diameter. The temperature of the air in an open-

ing of this size, even for tJie average of the year, cannot be taken to represent
that of the solid earth at the same dej)th, but will doubtless be found to be

intermediate between the latter and the mean temperature of the exter-

nal air.

   The Rev. Dr. Graham (Member of the Committee) has taken observa-
tions in a bore at Logie Works, near Dundee, tkrough the kindness of the

proprietors, Messrs. Edwards, from whom he received much assistance. The

bore was available to the depth of 640 feet, and was described, before the
observations, as being filled nearly to the surface with water, in which there

was no perceptible motion. Much difficulty was experienced from the shak-
ing down of the detached column of mercury in the thermometer ; but this

was at length obviated by fixing the thermometer horizontally in a hollow
cup in a piece of hard wood, which had a hinged glass cover to permit of
reading the indications, provision being made for the free circulation of the
water, and a weight being attached to the bottom to act as sinker. The
temperatures observed were exceedingly anomalous, being about 10° greater
at 100 feet than at 50 feet, then increasing to the depth of about 400 feet, and
afterwards decreasing to the bottom. Dr. Graham states that he and his
assistant observers were convinced that the water which filled the bore was
obtained at the depth of about 170 feet, and that while one portion rose to
the surface, another and smaller fiowed downwards and escaped through the

lower strata.

    Mr. John Hunter, Assistant to the Professor of Chemistry, Queen's Col-
lege, Belfast, has taken a few observations in two shafts, sunk with a view
to salt-mining, at high ground near Carrickfergus. In both of them the
water stood only to the depth of a few feet. It was found that the tempera-
ture of the air within the shafts increased downwards, at any one time, -with
tolerable uniformity, but varied greatly with the weather. The shafts were
kept constantly closed by boarded covers, except during the actual process
of observing. The temi^erature of the water at the bottom, which is as-

188 REPORT 1869,

Slimed to represent pretty accurately the temperature of the soil at the same
depth, was 62°*4 in Duncrue shaft at the depth of 570 feet (observed No-

vember 7, 18G8), and 66° in Mr. Dalway's new shaft at the depth of 770
feet (observed November 14, 1868). Assuming 48° as the mean surface-
temperature, the increase of temperature downwards would be at the rates
of 1° in 40 feet and 1° in 43 feet respectively. The soil in both cases was

yellow clay.

   Mr. David Burns, of H.M. Geological Survey, now stationed at Allendale

--near Carlisle, has taken observations in that neighbourhood, which he thus

describes : " The first shaft I tried is over 50 fathoms in depth, and is
about half full of water. It is situated on the summit of a ridge a few
yards distant from a fault of some 900 feet throw. The flow, or rather
change, of water in it, from these or other causes, is considerable, as is

shown by the temperature. The result of my observations may be put

thus :

as I repeated the observation to make sure of it. Perhaps at this level lies

the chief feeder of water.

   Mr. Burns goes on to relate his unsuccessful attempts to take observations
in two other shafts, which turned out to be closed, probably by platforms, at
a depth of several feet below the surface of the water.

   In concluding this Eeport, I would beg to direct attention to a valuable
summary of observations of underground temperature at great depths con-
tributed by Mr. Hull to the ' Quarterly Journal of Science' for January

--1868, from which the following Table of results has been condensed :

   Mr. Hull strongly insists on the necessity of observations at greater

depths. He gives reasons for maintaining that, at depths exceeding 2000

feet, no water would be found in ordinary Coal-measure strata, and offers a
recommendation in the following terms :

   " After much consideration, the plan which we venture to recommend, in

case of experiments being imdertaken by the British Association, or any
other scieutiiic society', would be, not to commence at the surface, but at
the bottom of a coal-mine, of not less depth than 600 yards.

    " There are several collieries, particularly in Lancashire and Cheshire,
sufl&cientl}' deep for the purpose. It would be an easy matter to excavate a
chamber in the coal and its roof, where the borings might be carried on. The
chamber ought to be a short distance from the bottom of one of the shafts,

and out of the way of mining-operations. As the process of boring pro-

gressed, observations should be taken at every 10 yards, and at every change
of strata, from sandstone to shale or coal. The boring might be carried
down at least to a total depth of 1000 yards from the surface, and having
been completed under proper supervision, could not fail to give results of
value to science. It is also probable that a proprietor of some colliery of
the required depth would willingly afford the facilities for caiTying on the
experiment, for the sake of the information he would derive regarding the
minerals underlying the coal-seam then being worked."

   With respect to this recommendation, I may say, in the name of the Com-

mittee, that they consider it very valuable, and would gladly avaU them-
selves of any opportunity of carrying it out, so far as the funds at their

 disposal permit.

Fifth Report of the Committee for Exploring Kent's Cavern, Devonshire.

   The Committee consistinc/ of Sir Charles Lyell, Bart., F.R.S.,
   Professor Phillips, F.R.S., Sir John Lubbock, Bart., F.R.S.,
   John Evans, F.R.S., E. Vivian, George Busk, F.R.S., William
   Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., and William Pengelly, F.R.S. {Reporter).

Before commencing the Eeport of their researches during the last twelve
months, the Committee beg to call attention to a few facts connected with
branches of the Cavern explored in previous years.

   In their Third Keport, presented to the Association at Dundee in 1867,
they stated that in a part of that branch of the Cavern termed the " Vesti-
bule," there was beneath the Stalagmitic Ploor, and generally in direct con-
tact with its nether surface, a layer of black soil, known as the " Black Band,"
which varied from 2 to 6 inches in thickness, covered an area of about 100
square feet, and at its nearest approach was 32 feet from the northern en-
trance of the Cavern. They also stated that this Black Band contained a large
amoiint of charcoal, and that in it had been found 366 Hint implements,
flakes, cores, and chips ; a bone harpoon or lish-spear, and a bone awl ; and
numerous bones and teeth of extinct and recent animals, some of which were
partially charred. Thej further remarked that were they to speculate re-

--specting the probable interpretation of the Black Band bearing in mind its

very limited area, its position near one of the entrances of the Cavern and
within the influence of the light entering thereby, its numerous bits of char-
coal and of burnt bones, its bone tools and its very abundant, keen-edged,

--unworn, and brittle chips and flakes of whitened flint, they might be tempted

to conclude that they had not only identified the Cavern as the home of an
190 REPORT--1869.

early Britisli family, but the Vestibule as the particular apartment where they

enjoyed the pleasures of their own fireside, cooked and ate their meals, and

fashioned flint nodules and bones into implements for war, for the chase, and

for domestic use*.

    To the foregoing description of the Black Band and its locality, it may he

added that, even during very wet seasons, that part of the Cavern is very little
exposed to drip from the roof.

   It may not be out of place to state here that, in order to ascertain to what

extent the hght penetrating the entrance of the Cavern was available, one of

the Superintendents of the exploration placed himself near the centre of the
Black-Band area, and found that without any artificial light he could distinctly
see to write a letter and to read ordinary print.

    But whilst the Committee have seen no reason to abandon or to modify
their interpretation of the Black Band, and whilst it has been generally ac-
cepted by those who by personal inspection have made themselves familiar
with the phenomena of the Cavern, they have found that by one very able
and experienced observer it has been regarded with some amount of scepti-
cism, on the groimd that the smoke of a fire in the Cavern would either suffo-
cate or expel the inhabitants ; that, in short, the interpretation was incon-
sistent, since it supposed the Cavern to have been inhabited under conditions
which would render it uninhabitable.

    To test the force of this objection, six large faggots of wood were piled in a
heap and set on fire, as nearly as possible on the centre of the area which the
Black Band had occupied. The fire burnt brilliantly and threw out large
tongues of flame, which licked the roof, whilst a party of five persons, without
the least inconvenience from smoke or any other cause, sat on the rocky
sides of the Cavern and watched the experiment. They were imanimous in
the opinion that the objection that was thus put on its trial was utterly in-
valid. It may be mentioned, too, that the temperature of the Cavern is per-
manent, and stands by night and by day, in summer and in winter, at about
52° Fahr., or half a degree above the mean annual temperature of the district

in which Kent's Hole is situated. Hence it may be concluded that, unless
the Black Band represents a period when the mean temperature of South
Devon was considerably below that which at present obtains, large fires would
not have been needed. Artificial heat would have been required, not to make

the Cavern tenantable, but perhaps for culinary purposes only.

   Before quitting this subject, it may be stated that the smoke drifted to-
wards the interior of the Cave, and that one of the party, who from time to

time passed all round the fire and to various distances from it, reported that
in the narrower adjacent ramifications it was oppressive.

   Soon after the Meeting at Norwich in 1868, Mr. Boyd Dawkins, a member

of the Committee, intimated his intention of visiting Torquay for the purpose
of examining and naming the remains of the Cave-animals which had been
collected during the exploration. It has been stated in previous Reports
that, from the beginning, a separate box has been appropriated to the speci-
mens found in each distinct " yard " of deposit, that is, in each pai'allelopiped
of Cave-earth a yard in length and a foot in breadth and in depth, that
with each set of specimens was packed a numbered label, and that the
Secretary recorded in his daily Journal fuU information respecting the

precise position of the objects thus numerically defined, as well as the date on

which they were exhumed. It may be added that, as soon as the specimens

                                           * Report Brit. Assoc. 1867, p. 32.
                               ;

were cleaned and packed, the boxes were stowed away in a room set apart
for them, the door was locked, and the Secretary never parted with the key.
It is obvious that the number of boxes of specimens waiting for examination
was equal to the number of " yards " in which fossils have been found. On
the 31st of December, 1868, this number was 3948 ; and though it is true
that some of the boxes contained no more than a single bone, it is also true
that in many of them there were upwards of a hundred ; hence it will be
seen that the task Mr. Dawkins had before him possessed Herculean dimen-

sions. When he began his examination, there must have been in store for
him more than 50,000 bones ; and though many of them were unidentifiable

chips merely, every one had to pass under review.
    In order that this gigantic labour might be somewhat facilitated, the Secre-

tary commenced to unpack each box, and to write on every specimen it con-
tained the number written on the accompanying label. While thus engaged,
on the 24th of September, 1868, with the box labelled 1847, he found amongst
its contents what appeared at first to be merely a very small bone, the greater

part of which was covered with a film of stalagmite. On being touched, the
investment fell oif (a very common occuiTence in the case of similar speci-

mens after having been washed and dried), and the object proved to be a por-
tion of a bone needle, having its point broken off but retaining its perfect
and weU-formed eye. This part had been concealed and, happily, protected
by the calcareous covering. The remnant is about -85 inch long and is

shghtly taper. Its section at right angles to its longest axis is subelliptical,

resembling that of a modern bodkin rather than that of a needle. Its greater
diameter at the larger end is about -075 inch, and at the smaller -05 inch
hence, assuming it to have been symmetrical in form and to have terminated
in a point, its original length must have been 2-55 inches. There are nume-
rous fine longitudinal striae on its sui-face, suggesting that it had been scraped
into form. The Secretary's daily journal shows that it was exhumed on the
4th of December, 1866, and that it belonged to the Black Band beneath the

Stalagmitic Ploor.

    Since its discovery it has unfortunately been broken, the Line of fracture
passing through the eye. Before the accident it had been seen by several

members of the Committee and by many other persons. The parts have been
very carefully and firmly reunited. The eye was capable of carrjung a thread

about three-eightieths of an inch in diameter, or about the thickness of fine

twine.

   On November 26th, 1868, while still engaged in preparing the specimens
for Mr. Boyd Dawkins, the Secretary had the good fortune to detect, under

precisely similar conditions, in the box labelled 2206, a bone " harpoon " or

fish-spear barbed on one side only. When dug out of the deposit it was in

two pieces, one of which was almost, and the other completely, encrusted
with stalagmite. Indeed the latter was regarded as a pipe of stalactite, and
as such was preserved. It is recorded in the Secretary's journal that it was
disinterred on the 7th of March, 1867, in the Vestibule, in the first or upper-
most foot-level of Cave-earth, beneath the Black Band, which was 4 inches
thick, and which was covered with a Stalagmitic Ploor varying from 12 to
20 inches in thickness, and that this, again, was overlaid with Black Mould
containing pre-Koman and Romano-British objects.

   The fact that remains of the extinct Cave-bear, Hyaena, and Rhinoceros
have been met with not only in the Stalagmitic Floor just mentioned, but
quite at its upper surface, must be borne in mind when attempting to form
an estimate of the chronology of the needle and " harpoon " just described.
           192 REPORT--1869.

                 Besides the foregoing, there was found during the preparatory examination,
/^/iJ7t^ in the box numbered 2067j.a canine of a Badger, the fang of wbich had been

              cut or otherwise reduced to a -wedge-hke form, and perforated obHquely as if
             for the purpose of being strung. It was exhumed on February 4th, 1867, in
              the '* Vestibule " in the second foot-level of Cave-earth, which is beUeved to
              have been intact ; but as the overlying Stalagmite had been broken up and
              removed by the earher explorers, the Supeiiutendents do not feel perfect

                confidence in the trustworthiness of its position.

                 The foregoing are the only objects of peculiar interest which have been re-
             cently detected among the specimens collected by the Committee, prior to the
              last Meeting of the Association, from the deposits beneath the Stalagmitic

                 Floor.

               There have been found, however, two noteworthy objects, among those which
             had been met with in the Black Mould overljing the Stalagmite, and which,
             therefore, can have no pretensions to great antiquity. The first is a bone
              needle, by no means so elegantly designed or so highly finished as that just

               described. Its proportions also are such as to secure for it great strength, and
                to enable it to carry a thi'ead or cord of considerable size.

                 The second object is a ring, apparently of Kimmeridge Coal, or some kin-
             dred substance. The diameter of the greater circle is upwards of an inch,
             and of the inner one about half an inch. The annulus is about -2 inch thick
              at its inner edge, and both surfaces are uuifonnly bevelled to a line at the

       --outer edge. Its breadth is not uniform, as the circles are not concentric.
                  Researches during the year 1868-69. During the year which has elapsed
              since the Meeting at Norwich in 1868, the Committee have, with very slight
              modifications to be noticed hereafter, conducted the excavation on the method
               desci'ibed in detail in their First lleport (Birmingham, 1865) ; the Superin-
               tendents have continued their daily visits to the Cavern ; the Secretary has
              recorded in his daily joiirnal such facts as have presented themselves ; monthly
              Reports have been regularly forwarded to the Chairman of the Committee ; the
             workmen have continued to be interested in their work, which they have per-
              formed with great zeal and integrity ; the interest felt by the general public in
               the progress of the investigation has suffered no diminution ; and the arrange-
              ments for the admission of visitors, which in previous j'ears worked so satis-
               factorily for all parties, have in all cases been carried out.

                 Since the last lleport was sent in, the Superintendents have had the plea-
              sure of showing the Cavern and explaining the operations to the Queen of the
               Netherlands and her suite, the Right Honourable Sir George Grey, the Pdght
             Honourable John Bright, and several Members of the British Association,

            including Sir W. Tite, Mr. G. Griffith (Assistant General Secretary), Pro-
            fessor TyndaU, Mr. W. A. Sanford, Mr. W. Fronde, Mr. J. E. Lee, Mr. S. R.

              Pattison, and others.

                Mr. Everett, who is about to proceed to Borneo to explore some of the

               caverns in that island under the auspices of the Raja of Sarawak, recently
              spent two days (July 31st and August 2nd) in Kent's Hole, accompanied by
              one of the Superintendents, for the purpose of studpng the operations in de-

            tail. It may be hoped that the British Association has in this way been able
             to render valuable aid to the Committee who have undertaken the important

       --work of cavern exploration in the far east.
                 The South-west Chamher. In the Fourth Report (1 868) the Committee stated
               that they were occupied in excavating that j^ortion of the Cavern termed the
              " South-west Chamber," which, so far as was then known, was the last or
              most south-westerly branch of the Eastern Series of Chambers and Galleries.

Thcjf fielded that tlic portion of the Chamber which they had reached -wan

completely closed with an enormous acciimnlation of IStalagmite, so that it
was not possible to form a coi'rect estimate of the size of the apartment, that

it was probably much larger than was then supposed, that the only known

communication between the Eastern and the Western Divisions of the Cavern
was the Yestibulc at its 02)posite or north-eastern end, and that the Super-
intendents inclined to the opinion that a passage would be found opening out
of the South-west Chamber, which would form a second channel of communi-
cation between the two Divisions. Respecting the deposits, the Fourth

--Eeport stated that, in the eastern part of the Chamber, they were : first, or

uppermost, Stalagmitic Floor, commonly of granular structiu'e ; second, the
ordinary Cave-earth, with Hint implements and the usual Cave-mammals
third, an Old Floor of Stalagmite of great thickness, and of a peculiar crys-
talline structure ; fourth, or lowest, a Hock-like Breccia, in which fragments
of grit, not derivable from the Cavern hiU, were abundant, and which, though
replete with remains of the Cave-bear, had neither bones nor any other indi-
cations of Hyaena, Ehinoceros, or other prevalent Cave-species. It was added
that in proceeding westward the Cave-earth had thinned out and entirely
disappeared, so that the two Stalagmites, between which was its proper place,

rested one immediately on the other.
    Soon after that Report was presented, the Committee found that a few feet

beyond the point where they had lost the Cave-earth, it once more appeared
in the section, occupying its accustomed position between the Stalagmites,
resting on the Old crystalline mass, and overlaid with that which is granular
and comparatively modern. It proved to be merely an insulated patch in
contact with the northern wall of the Chamber, along which it extended for

a distance of 11 feet. Its maximum breadth was 6^ feet, and depth 32 inches.
No sooner did it enter the section than it brought with it the characteristic
flint and chert implements, teeth of hya3na, mammoth, and fox, and gnawed

bones.

    Three of the implements deserve more than a brief mention, as they arc
very fine specimens, belong to different types, and can scarcely be said to bo
represented by any previously met with in the Cavern.

The first (No. ^^*) is of a diill light grey colour on the surface, but of

an undecided black within. In form it is a trapezoid closely approaching a

rectangle, but having the angles somewhat rounded off. It is about 4 inches

in length, 2| inches in breadth, and '8 of an inch in greatest thickness. It
is worked to an edge along the entire margin, and has apparently seen some
service as a scraper. With it were found a portion of a chert implement, a
molar of bear, molar of hyasna, four other teeth, a gnawed bone, and several

small fragments of bone.

  ^The second implement (No. 3918) is a beautifully white flint of poreeUa- /i'J^U

nous aspect. Its form is not easy to describe, but it may perhaps be said to

be rudely subovoid. Its extreme length is about 3-9 inches, breadth 2-5,

and depth 7· inch. It is flat on one face, and from a point near the centre

of the other side is unequally fined off to an edge all round the perimeter.

The third (No. 3922) is of the same kind of flint as the second. Every

part of its surface is elaborately chipped. It is flat on one side, uniformly                  /Ju,//,)
rounded on the other, and worked to an edge all round its circumference. It
                                                                                               y'
may be described as a canoe-shaped implement, or a long, narrow, pointed,

nearly symmetrical semiellipsoid, the principal diameters of wliich are 4-7
inches, 1-3 inch, and -6 inch. There were found -mth. it several teeth of
hyjena, bear, and fox, and a small quartz crystal.

   The Care-earth in which these specimens were found was completely sealed
lip with the ordinary overlying floor of stalagmite, which, though never
quite a foot thick, was at its upper surface almost everywhere in contact
Avith the limestone ceiling of the Chamber, and was nowhere separated from
it by an interspace of more than 3 or 4 inches.

    The same sections, continued across the Chamber towards its southern
wall, successively and uniformly showed that, beyond the patch just men-
tioned, they contained no Cave-earth, but were made up of one undivided
huge accumulation of Stalagmite, every accessible part of which apparently
belonged to the Old crystalline Floor, and rested on the Rock-like Breccia.
The two, conjoined, not only filled the Chamber, but there was nothing to
show that the Stalagmite did not extend upwards to the external surface of
the hill. There was no trace of limestone visible ; and the workmen had to

hew their way through two kinds of material, each more intractable than

any ordinary rock, and manfully they addressed themselves to their pro-
tracted toil, feeling some gratification in the fact that every inch they ad-

vanced was so much added to what had been previously supposed the entire

extent of the Cavern.

    "With some reluctance, it was decided to abandon the practice of breaking

up the entire mass of Stalagmite. The men were directed to remove the

lower or basal portion of it only, to excavate the imderlying Breccia to the
depth of five feet instead of four, which from the beginning to this time
had been the invariable practice, to leave the upper and greater part of the
Stalagmite intact overhead, and to cut a tunnel beneath it, laying bare
the limestone wall of the Cavern on each side.

    The Stalagmite, as well as much of the Breccia, could only be removed
with tlie aid of gunpowder ; and considerable care and judgment were
required in order that the remains of bear wMch both contained, and with
which the latter was crowded, should be injured as little as possible.

    The Committee have remarked in previous Reports that, on account of its
comparatively loose texture, stalagmite is blasted with great difficulty. AU,
however, that the workmen had previously experienced in this way was in-
considerable in comparison -ndth what they have encountered during the
last twelve months. In addition to the usual diflUcultics, there were others
 arising from the existence of cavities in the mass, one of which had a ca-
pacity of upwards of a cubic yard, into Avhich the boring tool would tmex-

pectedly plunge to inform the men that their labour had been in vain. Not

unfrequently a hole which had been bored with great labour, and appeared
to be quite satisfactory, would prove to be incapable of being fired on ac-
 count of its rapidly filling with water, which oozed through the Stalagmite
 as through a sponge.

  --The Crypt of Dates. The Western Division of the Cavern, no part of which

has yet been explored by the Committee, bifurcates towards its south-
 western extremit}', and, so far as is at present known, terminates in two ca-
 pacious chambers, termed the " Cave of Inscriptions " and the " Bears'
 Den." From the north-east comer of the latter, there extends a narrow
 gallery between almost vertical limestone walls. The greater part of it was,
from time immemorial, occupied by a pool or " Lake '' of water about 20
feet long, 8 feet broad, and of unknown depth. It was commonly regarded
as the end of the Cavern, and was separatee! from the Bears' Den by a consi-
ON RENTES CAVERNj DEVONSHIRE.                               195

 derable mound of Stalagmite. This Lake has called forth much speculation.
  Mr. Northmore believed the Cavern, of which he was the earliest explorer,

  to have been a temple of Mithras, and he spoke of the water as " the bap-
 tismal lake of 'pellucid water ' "*. Others have occupied themselves with
 guesses respecting the source whence the Lake received its supply, and the
 mode by which it was kept from overflowing. Some held that it was fed
 by a small perennial spring ; others that it was replenished by the drip
 from the roof only ; whilst a third party contended that there was neither
 waste nor supply, and that the water ebbed and flowed synchronously with

 the tides of the ocean.
     It is said that one adventurous \T.sitor climbed along its northern or least

 precipitous side from one end to the other ; but, according to the current

 belief, those who gained the further end usually did so by swimming.
 They aU are said to have brought back the report that the Cavern extended
 " a very little way beyond the water " Mr. M'Enery, speaking of the

 water, says, " the Cave beyond it deserves no particular notice ; Admiral

 Sartorius and others have swam across "f.
    From the direction and length of the passages leading to them, it was

 obvious that the Bears' Den and Lake could not be far removed from the

 South-west Chamber. In this opinion the Superintendents were confirmed

by the fact that when, from time to time, they visited the Den during the
progress of the excavation of the Chamber, they heard the sound of the work-
men's tools with great distinctness, and increasingly so as the work ad-

vanced, untn at length their voices were heard, and ultimately conversation
could be carried on, by means of shouting, however, rather than talking.
Finally, on removing the Modern granular Stalagmitic Floor in the north-
west corner of the Chamber, where it was in contact with the limestone roof,
a hole, about 3 inches across, and extending obliquely upwards, was dis-
closed in the limestone, and it was observed that a current of air occa-

sionally passed through it alternately in opposite directions. The workmen
were directed to enlarge the hole by breaking away the limestone, and to
ascertain whither it led. As soon as it was of sufficient dimensions, the
younger workman, John Farr, ascended thi'ough it, and after a short time
returned, stating that from the hole he entered a somewhat tortuous pas-

sage, having an easterly direction through the limestone, and so narrow and
low that it could only be traversed by lying prostrate, and adopting a ver-
micular motion ; that after a few feet he entered a longer passage in which it
was possible to turn round and, in some places, to stand erect ; that this
second passage had a north and south direction, extending both ways a few
feet only beyond the point at which he had entered it ; that the inner or
northern end was closed with stalagmite, on which he observed " writing,"
and that it terminated southward on the end of the Lake most remote from

the Bears' Den.
   Farr's report induced the other workman, George Smerdon, and one of the

Superintendents, to follow his steps, when they found his description to be cor-
rect in all respects. It was farther observed that the floor of the longer or north
and south passage was entirely composed of stalagmite, and was, in fact, tlie
upper surface of the mass beneath which they had begun to tunnel, and the

greater part of which, on accoimt of its enormous thickness and its intracta-
bihty, they had reluctantly decided to leave intact. At the inner end
this floor rose in the form of a steep irregular talus, on which, as well as on

the walls of the crypt, was the " writing " of which John Farr had spoken.

This proved to be a series of initials and dates, amounting, probably, to up-

wards of a hundred, inscribed on the Stalagmite. Amongst the dates arc

those of 1744, 1728, 1702, and 1618. In several cases the scribes cut the

figure of a square, and inscribed their initials within it.

Inscriptions in more accessible parts of the Cavern have long been well

known. The most famous is the following in the " Cave of Inscriptions :"
" Eobert Hedges of Ireland, Feb. 20, 1688," which there is good reason to

believe is really as old as it professes to be, thus rendering it not imxiroba-

ble that those discovered in the crypt are genuine also.

In looking at those dates, it seems impossible to abstain from reflecting on

the facts that they are cut on the upper surface of a mass of stalagmite up-

wards  of   12  feet  thick, in  a  locality where  the  drip  is  unusually copious
                                                                                                                                                              ;

and that two and a half centuries have failed to precipitate an amount of

calcareous matter sufficient to obliterate incisions which at first were proba-

bly not more than an eighth of an inch in depth.

It is scarcely necessary to observe that if the Stalagmite had been entirely

broken up, as was at first intended, the inscriptions would have been de-

stroyed with it ; or that the discovery of them confirmed the decision to re-
move no more of the nether surface of the floor than would suffice to give

--the workmen sufficient height for their labour.
   The Lalce. As the workmen advanced steadily towards the south-west,

every step rendered it more and more probable that a passage would be laid

open, leading out of the South-west Chamber in the precise direction of the

Lake, and thus furnished an additional motive for tunnelling beneath the

floor, in order that the Lake-basin might be preserved.

The removal of the Breccia, and of that part of the Stalagmite immediately

above it, disclosed the fact, with which, indeed, the Superintendents were

already familiar, that stalagmite is by no means impervious to water. In-

creased proximity to the Lake rendered this not only more and more patent,

but augmented the difficulty of blasting the mass, and caused the labour to

be one of great discomfort. It was therefore found necessary to tap the
Lake to allow the water to escape. As soon as it was sufficiently dry, the
workmen were directed to remove and examine carefully such deposits as
might be found lying on the Stalagmitic Floor of the basin. They proved to

be, first, or uppermost, the Modern Floor of Stalagmite ; second, the ordinary

Cave-earth, beneath which was the Old Crystalline Stalagmite of great

thickness.

The Stalagmitic Floor, overlying the Cave-earth, was from 10 to 12 inches

thick. It was finely laminated, and was soil-stained throughout ; but, ex-

cept at the ends of the basin and along its northern side, where portions of
it remained in situ in a coherent but brittle condition, it was everywhere

resolved into an almost impalpable paste, which, on being subjected to hy-

Adrochloric acid, rapidly effervesced and left very little residuum.  heap of

this paste thrown outside the Cavern has, on exposure to the weather, hard-
need into a coherent mass.

   In this pulpy mass were found numerous objects, none of which were of
much interest, as the following list shows :

   1. Extemporized wooden candlesticks, such as are commonly used by
those who visit the Cavern.

2. Pieces of candle.

   3. Stems and bowls of clay tobacco-pipes, one of the former being un-

usually large.
               ON KDNt's CAVBRNj DEVONSHIRE.                        197

--4. Bottles of various kinds wiue, lemoBade, and ginger-beer; some

entire, but most of them broken.

5. Wine and other glasses, all broken.

6. Fragments of earthenware and china cups.

7. Numerous sticks and branches of trees ; many of tliem charred.

A8. tin sconce.
A9. small iron claw-hammer.

10. The handle of a hammer.

A11. clasp-knife, shut.
A12. two-foot rule, closed.

13. The i^late of a child's iron spado.

A14. wooden ink-bottle (?).

15. An oystcr-sheU,

A16. pecten-shcU, apparently used to hold some kind of paint.
A17. wooden spatula.
A18. wooden tally, having the initials W. E. cut on it.
A19. well-squared block of wood, above 5 inches long and broad, and

2| inches thick.

  A20. wooden cover of a salting-pan, or of a small furnace.

  A21. portion of a stout iron chain, 44 inches long, consisting of twenty-

four links and a swivel, and having a padlock at one end.

22. Numerous broken stalactites, pap-like stalagmites, pebbles, and blocks

of limestone.

Many of the objects (such as the candles, candlesticks, bottles, glasses, &:c.)

present no difficulty. They were, no doubt, thrown into the Lake in frolic,

or bj'' those Avho did not care to carry them further after thej^ had ceased to

he of service. Others (such as the knife, foot-rnlo, hammer, &c.) were probably

dropped unintentionally ; and the cover of a salting-pan or furnace, as well as

the block of wood, may have been used to float candles by the curious.

It does not seem easj', however, to account for the chain. It is not an ob-

ject likely to have been useful during visits to the Cavern, nor is it such as

people commonly carry about with them. The pebbles were thrown in,

perhaps, in order to the formation of an opinion respecting the depth of the

Avater ; and the larger stones probably for the same purpose, or perhaps to

be used as stepping-stones by those who desired to traverse the Lake.

It is perhaps worthy of remark that there are no medieval or ancient

objects ; nor any such as might have been east in as votive oiFcriugs by

people who regarded the water with religious veneration.

Mr. M'Enery seems to have believed that there were probably objects of

"Weinterest in the Lake ; he says,  ought to rake it oat" *.

In the underlying Cave-earth in the Lake there were found a fragment of

an elephant's jaw containing a perfect molar, the finest specimen of the kind

with which the labours of the Committee have been rewarded ; a molar of a

horse ; several more or less perfect bones, including a humerus, an ulna, a
scapula, and radii ; and a fragment of a large horn-core.

That the Lake was supplied with water by infiltrations through the roof

exclusively there is now no manner of doubt, and that some portion of it

oozed away through the Stalagmite composing the bottom of the basin is no

less certain. The mechanism, however, which rendered it impossible for the

Lake to be filled to overflowing was, on cxamiuatiou, very patent and interest-

ing. In its left wall, which is almost naked hmestonc, there is a natural tunnel

               * See Trans. Devon. Assoc, vol. iii. p. 242 (1869).
198 · REPORT--1869.

or watercourse about 30 inches high and 20 inches wide, the base of which,
at its junction with the Lake, is 8 inches below the highest level to which
the water could rise, and forms an asceusivc inclined plane, having an incli-
nation of 3°, and a length of about 3| feet. Beyond this point the inclina-
tion is in the opposite direction, and is very much more rapid. Beyond a dis-
tance of 18 feet its course has not been traced, but it seems to ramify in
various directions through the limestone. At the common vertex of the two
planes, a diaphragm of stalagmite about 9 inches high and something more
than 1 inch thick, extends quite across the tunnel from wall to waU, having
its upper edge sensibly horizontal, and leaving above it a free open passage
several inches high. It is obvious that whenever the water attained to this
level the Lake was full, and that the surplus flowed over the diaphragm of

stalagmite or natural weir. The fact that this regulated the maximum level of

the water is confirmed by a corresponding and strongly marked high-water
line along the entire boundary of the Lake. It is equally evident that unless
there had been some other means of escape, this height, once reached, would
have been permanent. During protracted droughts, however, the water has

--been known to fall upwards of 2 feet below this level a fact accounted for

by the slow oozing of the water through the Stalagmite.
    The entire circumference of the Lake, and especially the almost vertical

limestone wall on the south, is thickly studded with coralloidal tubercles of
arragonite of various sizes, extending from the high-water to the low-water
line. Indeed, they occur quite to the bottom of the Lake, but arc less
abundant than in the zone just mentioned.

   Many parts of the Cavern present phenomena and problems of interest to

the physicist as well as to the anthropologist and palaeontologist. Thus, to

--go no further than the Lake, there are : first, the facts that, at one period,

the water entering through the limestone roof formed a floor by precipi-
tating carbonate of lime, and that subsequently water, finding access through
the same channel and lodging on this very floor, was capable of dissolving it
and reducing it to a mere paste, apparently as calcareous as when it was in
the coherent condition ; second, that during the work of destruction, coral-
loidal masses of arragonite were formed on the naked limestone and Old
stalagmitic walls, but chiefly on the former ; third, that the water had slowly
increased the capacity of the Lake, by building a weir of stalagmite entirely
across the narrow tunnel which formed its principal outlet ; and, fourth, that
had time been allowed, this latter process must iiltimately have closed the
outlet and cntii'ely changed the drainage of the Lake.

   From the inscriptions in it, the number of persons who, from time to time,

visited the Crypt of Dates, must have been very great ; and every one of
them must have talten the same route, namely, along the entire length of
the Lake. The earliest known mention of the water is that by Polwhclc in

1797, in his ' History of Devonshire'*, when its condition appears to have
been identical with that in which the Committee found it. Assuming it to
have existed, and in the same state when the inscriptions were cut, the
scribes must have performed the journey by wading through it, by using a

float, by climbing along its almost precipitous northern wall, or by sAvim-
ming. The last is perhaps the most probable mode; but in cither case
they must have provided themselves with the requisite tools and with an
adequate supply of candles. In some cases the work appears to have con-
sumed a considerable amount of time. If, however, it is supposed that at

least most of the inscriptions belong to the time when the upper Stalagmitic

--Floor of the Lake was yet undissolved, much of the difficulty will disappear, as

wading would then have been easy the Stalagmite would have afforded firm

footing, and the depth of the water would not have been very considerable,

even if permanently at the overflowing level, and the weir had been as high

as it is at present.

 --The Water Gallery. Having completed the excavation of the Lake, the

workmen resumed their tunnelling operations in the recess or passage lead-

ing out of the South-west Chamber in a south-westerly direction, and which,

as had been anticipated, was found to extend beneath the floor of the
basin and along its entire length. To this branch it is proposed to give the
name of "The Water Gallerj';" and probably no part of the Cavern sur-

passes it in interest or importance.

As might have been expected, the deposit it contained was made up of

the same materials as everywhere else were foimd beneath the Old Ploor

--of crystalline Stalagmite dark red earth ; angular, subangular, and rounded

pieces of grit not derivable from the Cavern hill, but which the neighbour-

ing and loftier Lincombe and Warberry hills can supply ; angular pieces of
limestone, and pieces of stalagmite (some of them of great size), which, of

course, were remnants of a floor more ancient still than the Old crystalline

Floor which lay ahove the Breccia and below the Cave-earth. The points in

Avhich the Breccia difftTcd from the Cave-earth were the darker colour of

the red soil forming its stajjle and the much greater prevalence of fragments
of grit. By the latter character alone it is very easy to distinguish the ma-
terials of the two dej^osits when thrown into the huge mass of refuse which
the workmen have lodged outside the Cavern, especially after exposure to a
shower of rain. Many of the pieces of grit, both angular and rounded,

were of a very dark colour, and some of them had a polished metallic aspect,
somewhat like that of a black-leaded hearthstone. The removal of the

smallest spUnter, however, showed that both colour and polish were su-

perficial.

Along a considerable part of the length and breadth of the "Water Gallery

the Breccia, instead of being in contact with the nether surface of the Sta-

lagmitic Floor which formed the bottom of the Lake, was sei^arated from it by

a vacuous interspace, sometimes 14 inches deep. It may be described as a

rudely lenticular space, as it was of greatest depth in the middle, and, if

Athe phrase is allowable, thinned ofl:' in every direction.  correct idea of

the complete insulation of this vacuity may be conveyed by stating that if

any animal, however small, could have become its occupant it would have

been a permanent prisoner unless it could have excavated for itself a passage

by which to escape.

   Here and there, moreover, the vacuity was interrupted by what may be

called " outliers " of Breccia, which reached, and were firmly adherent to
the Stalagmite above. In every other part, the ceiling, or lower surface of
the Stalagmite, retained traces of the deposit which had once been in con-
tact with it, and on which, indeed, it had been formed. To it there clung
angular and rounded pieces of rock, blocks of " Older'' Stalagmite, and bones,
teeth, and almost entire skulls of the Bear ; whilst between them, in the
ceiling, were the cavities once filled by similar objects, but which had fallen

out and were found on the surface of the Breccia beneath. From the ceil-
ing, too, there shot downwards numerous thin pipes of stalactite, of the

thickness and colour of goose-quills, some of which reached the Breccia.
The surface of the latter deposit beneath was here and there covered with
200 RKPOiiT--18GU.

patches of modern, stalagmite, occasionally incorporating pipes of stalactite,

such as have been just mentioned, which by some means had been broken
off. In fact a modern floor was in process of formation, vertically beneath
the old one, by the agency of water filtering through the latter, and carry-
ing with it the requisite calcareous matter.

  --As nothing would have been gained by their removal, the objects just

described are left adhering to the ceiling a fact which induces visitors to
regard the Water Gallery as the most attractive branch of the Cavern.

    All that portion of the Breccia wliich was not more than about a foot
from its upper surface, and about a yard from the south Avail of the Gallery,
was invariably cemented into a firm rock-hke concrete, but at aU lower
levels, and at greater distances from the south wall, it was perfectly in-
coherent. Where it was cemented it was crowded with fossils, but where it
was not, there were none. The former was its almost uniform condition in
the adjacent South-Avest Chamber and Lecture Hall, where its fossils formed

a very large percentage of the entire mass.

    The problem of the severance of the Breccia from the Stalagmite closely

occupied the attention of the Superintendents whilst the excavation of the

Water Gallery was in progress. There ajjpear, « priori, to be three possi-

--ble solutions, first, that a stream of water had insinuated itself between

the deposit and the floor, and had carried off the detritus which once filled
the interspace ; second, that, through failure of support at the base, the
Breccia had sunk away from the Stalagmite to a slightly lower level ; and,
third, that Avater passing slowly through the floor had carried the finer
particles of the detritus from the top of the Breccia to loAver levels, lodging
a portion of them in such interstices as it encountered, and perhaps carrying

off' the residue as colouring-matter.

    The first is met by the fatal objection that there is no channel, large or

small, either of ingress or egress, for the hj'pothetical stream, or the matter
it is supposed to have removed.

    Since the vacuity was both partial and discontinuous, the second sug-
gested solution requires that the supposed failure at the base should have
had the same characters, and hence that the Breccia should have been
faulted. To this latter point the closest attention was given from first to
last, and no trace of anything like a fault was ever detected.

    The third hyj^othcsis presupposes that both the Stalagmite and the Breccia

are permeable by water. On neither of these points is there any doubt.
Water has been seen oozing through this very Stalagmite, and it is Avell

kiioAvn that j'ools Avhich in Avet Aveather are formed on the Breccia dis-

appear in a short time on the cessation of the drip. Indeed, when the Lake
Avas tapped, the water was led to a depression in the surface of the Breccia
in the South-west Chamber, and in less than a week the greater part of

it had disappeared. There seems to belittle doiibt that the third is the true
solution of the problem of the severance in the Water Gallery.

   The animal remains found in that branch of the Cavern at present under
notice were, so far as is known, exclusively those of Bear ; and many of
them are fine specimens, including some splendid canines and molars.

Many of the bones were found broken, and some of them had been certainly

beautifully white and fresh, and it is rarely possible to detect any evidence

of wear on them. This latter fact was noticed by Mr. M'Enery when

speaking of the Bears' molars found in a similar deposit in the adjacent

Bears' JDen ; and was supposed bj- him to " intimate that the Bears of those
days were less exclusively fi'ugivorous than the modern species, and lived

partly on flesh " *.

   In their Fourth Report, the Committee, speaking of the deposit under the

Old crystalline Stalagmite, remarked, " Up to this time the Eock-like Breccia

has been utterly silent on the question of the existence of Man ; it has given

up no tools or chips of flint or bone, no charred wood or bones, no bones

sfilit longitudinally, no stones suggesting that they had been used as ham-

mers or crushers. But whilst they have before them the lessons so empha-

tically taught by their exploration of the Cavern, the Committee cannot but

think that it would be premature to draw at present any inference from this

negative fact " f.

   The cautiousness inculcated in this passage received its justification on

March 5, 18GU, when a flint flake (No. 31)91) was discovered in the Breccia

in question in the Water Gallery. The particulars of this discovery were

forwarded to Sir Charles Lyell, Chairman of the Committee, by the Sujwr-

--intendents, in the following passage in their Monthly lleport, dated April 8,

18G9 : " It was found with portions of the teeth of the Cave-bear, lying

on a loose block of Hmestone, in contact with the north wall of the Gallery,

in the third foot-level ; that is, from 2 to 3 feet below the surface of the

ABreccia.  section at right angles to its longest axis would be a scalene

triangle. The face of the flake represented by the smallest side is the

natural surface of the flint nodule from which the specimen was struck.

It required no more than three or, at most, four blows to produce it. On its

larger face the bulb of percussion is well pronounced. It is partially coated

with a thin ferruginous film, occasionally dendi'itic, and resembhng that

which      commonly coats the pebbles found in the Breccia. Beneath

this partial envelope it is of a light buff-colour. Its aspect is unlike that of

any implements or flakes found in the Cave-earth. None of its edges can

be said to be keen, yet it does not appear to have been roUed. One weU-

rollcd small flint pebble occurred in the Breccia in the Gallery.

   "Though the flake cannot be regarded as a,Jlne specimen, we think there
is little or no doubt that it was formed by human agency, and assuming

this to be the case, it appears to us to be of very great value, as it

was found in a deposit not only older than the ordinary implement-bearing

Cave-earth, but separated from it by the Old Floor, which in some cases was

upwards of 12 feet thick, and which is certainly of great thickness imme-

diately above the spot where the flake lay. In fact, it was found in a

deposit which, so far as the Cave evidence goes, was laid down before the

introduction of that in which were entombed the first traces of the Cave-

hysena, Cave-lion, Mammoth, and their contemporaries.

" Being impressed with the probably great importance of the discovery, we

carefully addressed ourselves to the question, ' Did the flake originally belong

to the comparatively modern Cave-earth in the Lake above and find its way

through some crevice in the Old Floor which forms the ceiling of the Gallery?

To this important question we arc prepared to give a negative reply ; for
   "1st. No crevice or hole of any land is discoverable in either the upper or

lower surface of the ceihng or Old Floor.

   " 2nd. The flake was not found vertically beneath any part of the Lake, but
fully a yard beyond its nearest margin.

    " 3rd. It did not lie on the surface of the deposit, but from 2 to 3 feet be-
neath it.

    " 4th. If the flake was originally lodged in the Cave-earth found in the Lake,
it must have been the ouly one deposited there ; for when we carefuUy and
completely emptied the Lake no flint implement was met with.

   " 5th. If the flake had found its way through the Stalagmite, it might have

been expected that some such bones as were found in the Lake (Horse and
JVIammoth, for example) would have descended through the same crevice ; but
instead of this, the remains of the Cave-bear alone are met with in the
Lreccia, and teeth of this animal were found in contact with the flake itself.

    " In short, there is no crevice through which the object could have passed
if it descended through the floor, it descended alone ; and if it did so de-
scend, it ought not to have been where it was found. "We have no hesita-
tion in stating that the flake is of the same age as the Ercccia which con-

tained it ; and that if our opinion of its human origin is confirmed, it is

anthropologically by far the most important object the Cavern has yielded."

   On June 3rd, 1869, the flake was submitted to Mr. John Evans, F.ll.S., a
Member of the Committee. He drew up the following statement, with the

--intention that it should be inserted in the present Ileport : " No. 3991 is

imdoubtedly of human workmanship. It is a flake of flint from the Challv,

one of the smaller facets of which shows the natural crust of the nodule from
which it was struck. The other external facet shows the characteristic de-
pression arising from the bulb of percussion on the flake previously removed
to form this facet. The flat or internal face of the flake shows a well-deve-
loped bulb, and the large but-end where the blow was struck has been
fashioned by two or tliree blows. It has therefore taken four or five blows,
each administered with a purpose in \'iew, to produce this instrument.

   " Not only, however, has it been artificiallj- made, but it carries upon it
evidence of having been in use as a tool ; for the edge produced by the inter-
section of the two principal artificial faces is worn away along its entire
length, and exhibits the slightly jagged appearance jiroduccd by the breaking
oft' of the sharp edge, such as I find by experience to result from scraping
bone or other hard substances with the edge of a flint flake.

                                                        " (Signed) John Evans, June 3, 1869."

    Besides the above, a small perfectly angular piece of coarse-grained white
flint (No. 4037«) was discovered in the first foot-level of the Breccia in the

Water Gallery on Friday, April 23, 18G9. It has all the aspect of having
been struck oft' in making an implement.

   Having ascertained by careful measurements that a very few feet would
take the workmen into the Bears' Den, it was decided to excavate the Water
Gallery no further, as it was deemed undesirable to commence the investiga-
tion of theWcstern Division of the Cavern so long as any branch of the Eastern

--Division remained unexplored.
   The South Scdh/-Port. Two long, comparatively narrow, and approxi-

mately parallel galleries extend in a south-easterly direction into the eastern
wall of the Eastern Division of the Cavern, one from the Great Chamber, the
other from the Lecture Hall. They were termed " The Sally-Ports " by Mr.

M'Enery, who believed that they ultimately led to external openings in the
eastern side of the Cavern hiU. On the discontinuation of the excavation of
the Water Gallery, the exploration of the South Sally-Port, opening out of
                                                                                                                      ;

                       ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.                                                                  203

the Lecture Hall, was commenced, aud at present has been completed to up-

wards of 40 feet from the entrance.

For the first 15 feet there was the ordinary granular Stalagmitic Floor over-

lying the tj-pical Cave-earth, but beyond that point there was no stalagmite,

except a thin and very limited patch in one or two places. At the junction

with the Lecture Hall the floor was 21 inches thick, but it became rapidly

thinner as it extended inward ; and for some feet it did not exceed an inch

in thickness.

No part of the Cavern is at present less than this exposed to drip. It may not

be out of place to state here, as a fact of, at least, large generality, and to Avhich

there is no known exception, that in those branches of the Cavern where the

drip is at present very copious the Stalagmitic Floor is of great thickness

and where the drip is but little, there is cither no floor or an extremely thin

one                    that, in short, the present amount of drip in any locality aff'ords                     a good
                    ;

index of the thickness of the floor there, so that the external drainage of the

Cavern hiU appears to have undergone no change for a very lengthened

period.

The South Sally-Port presented phenomena having no parallel in the ex-

perience of the Committee during the present exploration, but for which Mr.
M'Eneiy's " Cavern Kesearches " had prepared them. Speaking of the Sally-
Ports, or " Long Tongues," he says, " their entire area is honeycombed with

fox-holes, and the loam thrown up in mounds round their edges is mixed

with scales of the beetle, modern and fossil bones, all of which, as well as

the rocky contents, resembled bleached or calcined substances exposed on a

common." Indeed his description of the South Sally Port is not very en-

couraging. He says, " In attempting to reach the extremity of the lower

tongue at a point where it suddenly expands into a large grotto, the hollow

floor gave way like a pitfall with my weight and sank into a cleft of the rock.

my MyI shall not dissemble my terror at
                                                                           sudden descent.            eflforts to escape

would but cause the ground to sink still deeper and deeper into deeper

abysses.

                       " ' At subito se aperire solum vastosque recessiis
                           Pandere sub pedibus nigraque voragine i'auces.'

" The crash routed some animals from their subterranean abodes. I heard

them forcing their escape towards the oiitside through the incumbent earth,

and perceived their footmarks. The hounds frequently assemble outside
about this point, and frequeutlj- earth foxes there " *.

Happilj' none of the present exploring party have experienced any incon-

venience during their researches ; but they are constantly meeting Avith tun-

nels in the Cave-earth, probably made by some burrowing animals, with

ancient and modern bones commingled both on the surface and at aU depths

below it, with great clusters of the Aving-cases of beetles exclusively on

or very near the       surface                                        and  they have  had  impressed  on them  daily  the
                                                                   ;

important but familiar truth that unless sealed up with a Stalagmitic Floor,

Cavern deposits are just as likely to be fraught with anachronisms as with a

trustworthy chronological sequence.

   During the present month (August 1869) one of the Superintendents has
had occasion to pass frequently through " The Labyrinth," a branch of the
Western Division of the Cavern. As he entered it on the 6th he observed

some fresh Cave-earth lying on the floor where there was no stalagmite, and
he directed the attention of the workmen to it. They had all passed alono-

                       * See Trans. Derou. Assoc, vol. iii. p. 302 (1869).
304..                   REPORT--1869.

the same route the day before, and they were all satisfied that the earth was
not there then. On examination it was found to have been thrown out of a
newly made hole, in aU respects resembling those made by rats, and extend-

ing from the edge of a slab of limestone obhquely through the Cave-earth

beneath*.

In the South Sally-Port, the Black Mould, which in most of the other

branches of the Cavern was found continuously overlying the Stalagmitic Floor,

did not extend many feet within the entrance. Beyond the point at which

the Stalagmite ended, the entire deposit was Cave-earth from top to bottom

of the section, and in aU probability every part of it had been introduced be-
fore the formation of the calcareous floor began. In previous Reports the Com-

mittee have recorded the fact that in the Stalagmite itself are lodged remains

of the Cave-bear, Hyaena, and Rhinoceros. Indeed the only fossU found in

the scanty floor in that branch of the Cavern now under consideration was a

tooth of the last-named species, which is not only in quite the upper part of

tlie stalagmitic sheet, but, instead of being completely covered, projected

above its surface. Obviously, then, Ursus sjieJceus, Hyania spelcea, Sindlihino-

ceros tichorhhms ontlived the era of the Cave-earth, and therefore it would

not be surprising if their remains, together with palfeolithic flint implements,

were found lying on the surface of this deposit ; nor, if they were left unpro-
tected, would there be anything inexplicable or strange if they were found

mixed with objects belonging to more recent periods, or even to the present

daj'. Such a commingling might or might not be the result of disturbance

and rearrangement when occurring on the surface, but could not be otherwise
explained when met with below it.

Be this as it may, it is imdeniably the fact that in this, but in no other

branch of the Cavern which the Committee have exjjlored, ancient and modern

bones, and unpolished flint implements and rude potter^', have been found

lying together. Remains of the extinct brute inhabitants of Devonshire are

mixed confusedly with those of the present day, and the handiwork of the

human contemporary of the Mammoth is found inosculating with the product

of the potter's wheel.

It is worthy of remark that whilst potsherds lie on the surface, and the

mouths of shafts, connected with the tunnels or burrows, stand open to

receive them, instances of their having fallen in are extremely rare. The

modern objects found in the body of the Cave-earth are almost without excep-

tion such as have been actually taken in by the recent animals which made

their homes there.

In a sensibly horizontal tunnel about the size of a fox-earth, at a depth of

4 feet below the surface, there was found a beU, such as huntsmen are wont

--to suspend to the neck of a terrier when sent in after a fox a fact which in

all probability explains its presence in the spot it occupied.

In other and smaller buiTows bundles of moss, each about the size of a

man's fist, have been met with and supposed to be the nest of some animal.

Compared with the phenomena of every other branch of the Cavern ex-

plored by the Committee, those of this Sally-Port  are  no  doubt  anomalous
                                                                                                            ;

   * The visits of rats to the Cavern and tlieir habit of carrying off candles have long been
well known. In January 1867 the workmen observed a rat in the Cavern on several suc-
cessive days. At length he made his presence felt iri a very disagreeable manner. At 9 a.m.
the principal workman placed liis dinner, carefully lodged in a bag, in a stout wicker basket.
At the dinner-hoiu- (1 p.m.) he found that the rat had eaten a hole through the basket,
anotlier through the bag, and carried off every particle of his meal. Poisoned food was at
once prepared for the intruder, and nothing further was seen of him until a few days after
his dead body was found.

mammals, with a greater number of the teeth of the Mammoth than have
been met with by the Committee within an equal space elsewhere. The
bones are generally of less sjiecific gravity, softer, and more brittle than those

--found in the Cave-earth in other branches of the Cavern a fact perhaps ascri-

bable to the absence of a calcareous drip. Many of them are gnawed, some

have entirely escaped this ordeal, and a few have marks on their surfaces
apparently unlike those produced by teeth. Most of them on being cleaned
retain impressions of the brush used for that purpose. The surfaces of seve-

--ral are more or less covered with rudely circular punctures of various sizes

fact observed occasionally in those found elsewhere, but much less frequently
than in these in this branch of the Cavern. Lumps of fiscal matter are by
no means rare.

   The flint and chert implements and flakes are ten in number, three of which
were met with on the surface, one in the first foot-level, three in the second,
two in the third, and one the position of which is somewhat uncertain.

    Four of them only need description. The first (No. 4155) is a splendid
heart-shaped chert implement. It was found June 12,1869, lying on the
surface of the Cave-earth, beneath an overhanging ledge of limestone which
it almost touched, on the west side of the Sally-Port. It was wrought from
a chert nodule apparently selected from the supracretaceous gravel of Milber

Down between Torquay and Newton Abbot. It is about 4^ inches long, 3

inches in greatest breadth, and 1| inch thick at 1| inch from its broad
end. The but-end only retains the original surface of the nodule. It is the
only implement of the kind found by the Committee, and none of those figured
by Mr. M'Enery at all resemble it.

    The second (No. 4259) is of fine-grained silvery grey flint. It is sjanme-
trlcally canoe-shaped, 3-6 inches long, 1-2 inch broad, and -4 inch in greatest
thickness. It is flat on one side, somewhat rounded on the other, worked to
an edge all round the margin, and considerably chipped on both surfaces. It
belongs to the same type as the implement (No. 3922) previoiisly described,
but is much less rounded on the outer surface. It was found on the Cave-

earth, July 5, 1869.

    The third (No. 4263) is formed of rather coarse white cherty flint. It is
flat on the inner surface, carinated on the outer, and is not highly finished.
It is about 4 inches long, 1-3 inch broad, -6 inch in greatest thickness, and
was found Jidy 6, 1869, 2 feet deep in the deposit.

    The fourth is strongly carinated on the outer surface ; the inner is very
concave longitudinally, and slightly convex transversely. It is 3-4 inches
long, 1-2 inch broad, and -5 inch where thickest. It is chiefly remarkable
from having a square tang at one end, -8 inch long and -6 inch broad, as if
for fastening into a haft. Its opposite end is rounded, it is fined off to an
edge all round, and it appears to have been used as a scraper. It was found

of Cave-earth which, without being observed, had slipped off the face of the

section ; hence its exact position is uncertain.
    Charcoal has heen found somewhat plentifully on the surface, where a few

burnt bones occurred with it. It has also been met with at all depths in the
deposit, though in no great (Quantity.

  A few marine shells of common species Avere met with on the surface.

   The fragments of pottery differ in colour and in finish, and probably belong

to more than one period. Two or three of them are rather longer than those

commonly fouiid in the Cavern.
   During the last twelve months Mr. Boyd Dawkins, assisted by Mr. Ayshford

Sanford, has made considerable progress in identifying and naming the fos-

sils. He has prepared and sent in a Catalogue of a large number of speci-

mens, accompanied by the following Eeport.

    In the determination of the following animals from Kent's Hole Cavern I

have been aided l)y my friend Mr. Ayshford Sanford. By far the greater
portion of the labour has been undergone by him. We have examined up-

Avards of four thousand specimens, or rather less than one-tenth of the whole

accumulation of the remains in the hands of the Committee. No bones of

birds or fish have been catalogued ; the latter Dr. Giinther has kindly under-

taken to name before our Eeport is concluded. The results of our work are

contained in the following catalogue.

 --Homo. We have met with no bones or teeth from the Cave-earth that can

be ascribed undoubtedly to man. One or two much-worn or mutilated inci-
sors, however, may be human, but they may also belong to several other ani-
mals. The human remains from the prehistoi-ic deposit of Black Mould are
exceedingly abundant, and many of them, in Mr. Sanford's opinion, bear
evidence of the former existence of caunibals in the Cave. Some of them

have been cut and scraped by sharp instruments, the marrow-bones are

broken, and are mixed indiscriminately with the broken bones of Sheep or

Goat, Red Deer, Bos hngifrons, and other animals. In one box there are the

--remains of at least three individuals a large man, a nearly full-grown woman

or lad, and a child about half-groAvn.

   Man has also left his handiwork on some very remarkable fragments of
canines of Bear from the Cave-earth, which, in common with many other

splinters of bone, are in a totally different mineral condition to that presented

by the ordinary Cave-remains. They are much more crystalline, much

heavier, and of a darker colour than the ordinaiy teeth and bones, and have

been so mineralized that they present a fracture almost conchoidal, and
strongly resembling that of a Greensand chert. One of these had been

fashioned into a flake, and one of its surfaces presented the usual traces of

use. It had manifestly been formed after it had lost its normal dentinal

texture. It is clear, therefore, that they had become fossilized before the in-

troduction of the present Cave-earth. Viewed in connexion with the evi-

dence of the existence of an ancient floor that is now represented by masses
of stalagmite, sometimes ossiferous, we cannot resist the idea that they arc

samples of the contents of the Cave which had in the main disappeared before

the introduction of the present Cave-earth.
--Fells spelaa. The Cave-lion is tolerably abundant in the Cave-earth.
--AFelis, sp. ?
                 single canine from the Cave-earth indicates an animal of

the size of Lynx cervaria.

--AFelis catus '?  lumbar vertebra from the Cave-earth corresponds in size

with that of the Wild Cat.

 --Hi/cena spelcea. The Cave-hyajna is very abundant in the Cave -earth.
  --Cams lupus. The Wolf, on the other hand, is comparatively rare.

  --Canis domesticus. The remains of the Dog are sparingly met with in the

Black Mould, and indicate the presence of more than one variety.

  --Canis vidpes. The Common Fox is found in the Black Mould, and sparingly

--in the older subjacent deposit.
    Canis vulpes (var. spelceus). Vulpine bones, on the other hand, from

tlie Stalagmite and Cave-earth indicate an animal larger and stouter than

--the English Fox. These are not found in the Black Mould.
   Canis (size of C. isatis). With the larger bones there are a few much
smaller than those of the Common Fox, that correspond most closely with

those of C. isatis. The vulpine skulls, however, in the Taunton Museiim,

from the Mendip Caves, rather indicate a species closely related to C. isatis

than a specific identity, since the true molars are somewhat broader. It is

well to mention that Mr. Sanford has identified a portion of a skull found

along with the remains of Hyaena, in a cave on the opposite side of Torbay,

as belonging to Canis isatis.
--AOulo luscus.
                   single os innominatum of a nearly full-grown Glutton in-

dicates the presence of this rare mammal in the Cave-earth. Although it be-

longed to an animal not quite adult, it agrees almost exactly in size with that

--of a fully grown male from Sweden.
   Meles taxus. The remains of the Badger are abundant in the prehistoric
Black Mould, rare in the Cave-earth. In the latter case we doubt the truly

--fossil condition of the bones.
    Ursiis spelceus. The bones and teeth of the Cave-bear from the Cave- earth

indicate greater variation of size than those of any other wild animal with

--which we are acquainted.
    Ursus priscus=ferox. This species, which has been proved by Mr. Busk

to be undistinguishable from those of the North-American Grizzly Bear,

occi;rs abundantly in the Cave-earth, as it does also in the caves of the

We have come to the conclusion that the Red Deer was more variable in size

during the postglacial period than at the present day. Some teeth are not

larger than those of a small hind from the Hebrides, while others surpass in

size those of the largest Haddon or Horner Hart. Some even almost rival

those of the smaller specimens of the Irish Elk. The animal occurs both in
the superficial Black Mould and in the Cave-earth.

they are for the most part replaced by larger and stouter bones, which may

perhaps be referred to Lepus dUuvianus of the French naturalists. These

stout bones are very rare in the Black Mould.

         ON CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION. 209

Report of the Committee on the Connexion between Chemical Con-
    stitution and Physiological Action. The Committee consists of Dr.

   A. Crum Brown^ Dr. T. R. Fraser, andT>x. J. H. Balfour, F.R.S.

    The investigations were conducted and the Report prepared hy Drs.

   A. Crum Brown and T. R. Fraser.

Drs. BEOTyy and Fkaser communicated to the Section, at the Noiwick
Meeting, the results of some experiments (the details of which have since
been published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh) on
the connexion between change of chemical constitution and change of phy-

siological actiyity.

    They haye since that time continued their investigations by applying the
method described in the aboye communication to the alkaloids, ati'opia, conia,
and trimethylamine. The substances which they have compared in refer-
ence to their physiological action are, atropia and the salts of methylatro-
pium, conia, methylconia, and the salts of dimethylconium, salts of ammonia,
trimethylamine, and tetramethylammonium. They have made in all about
120 experiments, and give in the accompanying Table the results of thirty-
six, in which the dose was not much above or below the minimiim fatal.
It will be seen that these results confirm the conclusions at which they
formerly arrived, viz. that the action of compounds of triatomic nitrogen is
different from that of compounds in which the nitrogen is stably pentatomic,
and that salts of ammonium bases act on the peripheral terminations of the
motor nerves in the same way as curara. This action, and the absence of
convulsant action, appear to be generic characters of the salts of ammonium
bases. Besides this, the salts of the ammonium bases frequently retain cer-
tain of the special (specific) actions of the nitrile bases from which they are

derived.

           PROVISION FOR PHYSICAL RESEARCH IN GREAT BRITAIN. 213

   Experiment 38. The two vagi nerves were exposed in the neck of a rabbit,

and on separately subjecting the trunk of each nerve to galvanic stimulation

of a certain strength (obtained by the use of Du Bois-Eeymond's induction-

apparatus), it was found that stoppage of the heart's contractions resulted on
each occasion during the five seconds the galvanic stimulation was applied.

A solution containing half a grain of sulphate of methyl-atropium in fifteen

minims of distilled water was then injected under the skin of the abdomen.

Report of a Committee, consisting of Lieut. -Col. Strange, F.R.S.,

  purpose of inquiring into, and of reporting to the British Asso-

 --ciation the opinion at which they may arrive concerning the fol-

    lowing questions

        I. Does there exist in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and

                  Ireland sufficient provision for the vigorous prosecution of
                  Physical Research ?

       II. If not, what further provision is needed ? and what measures

                 should be take?i to secure it ?

Your Committee, having sought the counsel of many of the most eminent
men of science of the United Kingdom upon these questions, so far as it was

found practicable to do so, and having carefully deliberated thereon, have ar-

rived at the following conclusions :

   I. That the provision now existing in the United Kingdom of Great Britain

--214 REPORT 1869.

and Ireland is far from suflScient for the vigorous prosecution of Physical
Research.

    II. It is universally admitted that scientific investigation is productive of

enormous advantages to the community at large ; but these advantages can-
not be duly reaped without largely extending and systematizing Physical
Research. Though of opinion that greatly increased facilities are undoubt-
edly required, your Committee do not consider it expedient that they should
attempt to define categorically how these facilities should be provided, for the

following reason :

   Any scheme of scientific extension should be based on a fuU and accurate
knowledge of the amount of aid now given to science, of the sources from

which that aid is derived, and of the functions performed by individuals and
institutions receiving such aid. Your Committee have found it impossible,
with the means and powers at their command, to acquire this knowledge.

A formal inquiry, including the inspection of records to which your Committee

have not access, and the examination of witnesses whom they are not em-

powered to summon, alone can elicit the information that is required ; and, as
the whole question of the relation of the State to Science, at present in a
very unsettled and unsatisfactory position, is involved, they urge that a Eoyal
Commission alone is competent to deal with the subject.

   Your Committee hold that this inquiry is of a character sufficiently im-
portant to the nation, and sufficiently wide in its scope, to demand the use of
the most ample and most powerful machinery that can be brought to bear
upon it.

   Your Committee therefore submit, as the substance of their Report, the
recommendation that the fuU influence of the British Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science should at once be exerted to obtain the appointment of
a Royal Commission to consider

       1. The character and value of existing institutions and facilities for
              scientific investigation, and the amount of time and money devoted

                to such purposes.

      2. What modifications or augmentations of the means and facilities that

               are at present available for the maintenance and extension of

                  science are requisite ; and,

       3. In what manner these can be best supplied.

        On Emission, Absorption, and Reflection of Obscure Heat.
                                By Prof. Magnus*.

There was a time when heat was considered to be very different from light.
Now, however, we are persuaded that the only difference between them is the
length of the waves by which they are produced and propagated. Therefore
I thought that the weU-kuown laws of the radiation and absorption of light
must also exist for heat. I followed in these thoughts Mr. Balfour Stewart,
who, ten years ago, and several years before Kirchhoff and Bunsen had pro-

pounded their theory, published a paper in which he developed nearly the
same ideas for heat as these philosophers did for light.

   I wiU endeavour to give some of the results at which I arrived; but

         A* communication ordered to be printed in extenso among the Eeports.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

       EMISSION, ABSORPTION, AND REFLECTION OF OBSCURE HEAT. 215

before doing this, I must mention that for these experiments it was necessary
to obtain the rays from the body examined unmixed with those of the flame
or of any substance by which the body is heated. I succeeded in this by
making use of a stream of heated air in which the body was suspended.

    I found that different substances heated to 150° C. emit different kinds
of rays ; some only one kind, or waves of one length, and others waves of

many different lengths. To the first class belongs pure Rock-salt. There is

an analogy between the heat emitted by this body and the light produced
by its vapours, or rather of the Sodium it contains. The light from this sub-
stance gives only one hue in the spectrum, and the heat also is only of one
wave-length. It is monothermic, as its vapour is monochromatic.

   Rock-salt absorbs the heat given out by Rock-salt, while it absorbs almost
none of that given out by other substances.

    There is another crystallized substance, the chloride of potassium, called
Sylvin, very hke rock-salt in its behaviour ; but it is not monothermic, because
it absorbs the heat from different substances, not in a very high degree, but to
a greater extent than rock-salt does.

   If our eyes would allow us to see the dark heat as we see light, and we
could project a spectrum of the heat of rock-salt, we should see but one line.

Rut in making use of the heat emitted by chloride of potassi^^m a longer
space would be iUuminated, but not so long as from lampblack or from a

flame.

    Here also is an analogy between the heat and light given off by chloride

of potassium.

    I then made experiments on the reflection of heat, and I foiind that Silver,
Glass, Rock-salt, Sylvin, and Fluorspar reflect nearly the same quantities of
heat coming from a flame, from Lampblack, Glass, or from other substances.
Rut of the heat from Rock-salt, the Fluorspar reflects five times as much as of
that from other siibstances. Of the heat from Sylvin the Fluorspar reflects
three times as much.

    It follows from these experiments that if obscure heat were visible,

and if Rock-salt were used as the source of heat, we should see the Fluorspar
brighter than all other bodies, as far as I know at present. With Sylvin as
the source of heat we should see the Fluorspar bright, but not so bright as in

the heat from Rock-salt.
    Although invisible to the eye there are millions of rays of heat passing

between difl'erent substances, being partly absorbed and partly reflected

and although we are surrounded by these motions, we cannot observe them

but by special experiments.

   The analogy between light and heat seems to me to be complete.

216 REPORT--1869.

Report on Observations ofLuminous Meteors, 1868-69. By a Committee,

   consisting of James Glaisher, F.R.S., of the Royal Observatory
   Greenivich, President of the Royal Microscopical and Meteorolo-

  gical Societies, Robert P. Greg^ F.G.S., F.R.A.S., E. W. Brayley^

   i^. /?.(?., Alexander S. He^scuel, F.R.A. S., and Charles Brooke^

    F.R.S., Secretary to the Meteorological Society.

The Catalogue of the Tenth Eeport of this Committee contains the results of

assiduous observations of shooting-stars, directed principally to the periodical

dates when shower-meteors are usually expected to occur. Many observations

are, besides, recorded from the published accounts, and privately communi-
cated descriptions of observers on the large meteors which have appeared
with more than ordinary frequency during the interval of the year elapsed

since the presentation of the last Report.

   The general insufficiency of some of the observations, for the piirpose of

determining approximately the real distance of the meteors, is not greater

than must always be expected to arise, when a due allowance is made for
the unprepared condition of observers at the moment of the appearance of

such unusually large and brilliant meteors as have during the past year been
seen in some abundance. The comparison of some of the accounts contained

in the present list has, nevertheless, led to satisfactory conclusions re-

garding the real height and course of some of the sj^lendid fireballs recorded

in the paragraphs of this Report. Among those which principally appear to
have afforded elements of strict mathematical calculation may be mentioned

the observations made in France on the large fireball of the 5th of September,
and those at Cambridge and in Paris on the detonating meteor of the 31st of

May last.

    Some interesting communications on the same subject, bearing especially
on the extent, velocity, and direction of the currents observed to exist in the

loftiest regions of the atmosphere, are included with the heights of certain
persistent meteor-streaks determined by Professor Newton, in the United

States, on the 14th of November last. These observations, wdth the last-
mentioned descriptions of bright meteors seen at the same time in England
and on the Continent, are contained in the first Appendix of the Report.

   The occurrences of new aerolites and of other large meteors are described

in detail, and frequent minor notices of similar appearances from foreign
sources are placed in the second Appendix ; to which is added a Catalogi;e
of recent fireballs, completing up to the present time the very comprehensive
list of such appearances which, since their first Report, Mr. Greg has continued
with unfailing industry to collect for the Committee.

    The observations reported in the next Appendix show that the periodical
star-shower of August, in the past and present years, has been made the
subject of increasing attention in England and on the Continent. The sys-
tematic observation of the rate of frequency, time of maximum, and apparent
position of the radiant-point has not yet cleared up some of the perplexities
which surround the exhibition of this well-known but not yet thoroughly
explained phenomenon. The possible prevalence of several maxima, and an
apparent oscillation of the radiant-point in successive years between tolerably
wide limits in the constellations Perseus and Cassiopeia, are features of this
meteoric current which especially call for further investigation. The charac-
 teristic appearances of the meteors, both as to magnitudes and to the abun-
       A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS. 217

rlance and duration of their luminous streaks, are also points of principal and

recurring interest.

Owing to the exceptionally overcast state of the sky in England during

the whole of the winter and summer months of the past }'ear, the number of

observations of the ordinary shower-meteors of October, December, January,

and April last have not onl}^ been unusually deficient, but observers in

England were unfortunately deprived of more than partial views of the great

star-shower of the 14th of November last. Several interesting notices of the

bright display, from transatlantic and continental stations, will, however,

be found in the third Appendix ; and that and previous reappearances of the
star-shower are further illustrated by papers in the fourth Appendix of the

Report. Some insight into the phj'sical structure of the November meteoric

cloud has, it wiU thus be seen, been derived from the simultaneous observa-

tions of its recent principal displays at places as far apart in longitude as

Shanghai, Calcutta, Greenwich, and the observatories of the United States.

It appears that the central and most compact portion of the stream was

twice encountered in the years 1866 and 1867, while in the years 1865 and

1868 respectively, two outlying currents of greater width, but of less consi-

derable density, were crossed, one on either side of the central stream, and

separated from it, the former in front of, and the latter behind its margin, by

an equally broad well-defined space comparatively devoid of meteors. This

curious circumstance, first pointed out by Mr. Marsh, of Philadelphia, is

drawn from observations at the conclusion of Appendix IV.

  A review of several important pa2)ers published, and received by the Com-

mittee, during the past year, occupies the whole of the fourth and last

Appendix of the Catalogue. The consideration now generally bestowed upon

observations of luminous meteors is sufficiently rewarded by the occasional

perusal of such papers of eminent scientific interest in the special branches

of aerolitic and meteoric astronomy ; while the present zeal of observers is
evinced by their association together in France and Italy to record in a

regular and systematic form, under the direction, at Metz, of a luminous

meteor committee like that of the British Association, the transitory pheno-

mena of meteors and faUing-stars. In consequence of the combination of

observers to observe shooting-stars together on stated nights, it cannot be

doubted that a great accession to the present state of knowledge of this

class of bodies will thus, in the course of a few years, be obtained. The

star-showers of April last, which, on account of the unfavourable state of the

weather, were unperceived in this country, were yet conspicuously seen at

Moncalieri near Turin, and at Urbino, and the radiant-points of these

meteoric epochs of the 10th, 20th, and 30th of April, already previously

established by the British Association, received an unexpected confirmation.

With the object of furthering the views, and assisting the progress of meteoric

science in its most highly productive sphere of observation, the Committee,

in presenting this their Tenth Annual Eeport, express the hope that the

same success may continue to attend their future efforts which has rewarded

them in the first period of their existence, and which was originally be-

queathed to them by the great and talented author of the annual Reports to

the British Association on observations of luminous meteors, when, in the

year 1860, after compiling the present Catalogue alone and presenting it

unassisted to the British Association for fifteen years, he for the first time

placed the preparation of these Reports, and the annual collection of obser-

vations of luminous meteors, in the hands of a committee.

                                    I. Meteoes Doubly Observed.

Seveeal of the large meteors described in the foregoing catalogue having,

from their extraordinary brightness, attracted the attention of observers at

many places in England, as well as in neighbouring places on the Continent,

to which the course of their aerial flight was more immediately directed, the

comparison of the accounts affords, in some instances, approximate estimates

of the real heights and distances of their luminouB paths.

The course of the large meteor seen in central Erance on the evening of

the 5th of September, 1868, although imperfectly determined by the English

observations in Auvergnc and at Geneva, must yet have been little less than

100 miles in length over the valleys of the Seine, the Yonue, and the Loire,

north and west of the mountains of Cote d'Or and Auvergue, directed, ap-

parently at no great inclination to the horizon, from north-east to south-

west, at a height of u])wards of fifty miles above the earth. In the absence

of more complete descriptions of its apparent course, only the general direc-

tion of its real path and the nearest departments of Erance (Yonne and

Cher) over which tbc meteor must have been conspicuous can be pointed

out. The very distant observations of the same meteor at Aosta and Elorence,

however, indicate for the earlier portion of this meteor's flight a far more

extraordinary length of course than is common among large fireballs. The

following notice of a careful stirdy of its real jiath and altitude will accord-

ingly be read with more than ordinarj' interest. (See Comptes Eendus for

--August 2, 186'J, vol. Ixix. p. 326.)
   " Meteors. In a jiapcr addressed last week to the Ereuch Academy of

Sciences, M. A. Tissot examines the circumstances accompanying the passage

of the remarkable bolis of the 5th of September, 1868. It was seen to pass

over Belgrade, Laybach, Bergamo, Saulieu, Civray-sur-Cher, and Mettra}' *.

At Bergamo, M. Zezioli found that in 17 seconds it described an arc, the

extremities of which were respectively, in right ascension 17°, N. dcclin.

3°                 E.A.  202°,  N.  decl.  27°.  At Tremont, M. Magnin, while observing
                ;

Jupiter, had at one moment both the planet and the fireball in the field of his

telescope. M. Mugnier at Saulieu and M. BadiUer at Civray-sur-Chcr both

saw it in the zenith. Letting alone the two latter data, which are somewhat

uncertain, tliere is just enough left to enable us to determine the position of

one point of the meteor's path, and those of two right lines between which

it moved during a known space of time. Erom this may be obtained the

minima of velocity with respect to the earth and the sun, and which are re-

spectively SO and 71 kilometres per second. Now were the orbit described

elliptical, or even parabolic, the velocity could not exceed 42 kilometres
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

there can therefore be no doubt that the trajectory was an hyperbola. This

is, we believe, the first time that the path of a fireball his been ascertained

from reliable mathematical data. Erom this starting-point M. Tissot pro-

ceeds to correct the doubtful observation of Civray, and finds that the meteor

passed over that place at a distance of 3° 12" from the zenith. The lowest

altitude of the bolis was 111 kilometres; the eccentricity of the geocentric

hyperbola was 124, and its two asymptotes formed an angle of one degree

    * M. Tissot states tliat tho path of the meteor was vertically over these places ; its

altitudp nf rfs disappearance over Meltray, in Indve ct Loire, 798 kilometres (496 miles)
IVom Uergauio, being ;i07 kilometres (191 miles), and the lowest altitude of ils course
was 111 kilometres (69 miles). The meteor therefore shot upwards (!); and the whole
length of its course from Belgrade, in Servia, to Mettray was nearly 1000 miles

Sept. 25th, 19 hours ; A'elocity at perihelion 100 kilometres per second. Mo-
tion retrograde. The meteor merely passed through our solar system ; twenty
days after it made its appearance it passed through its perihelion, the dis-
tance of which from the sun is ahout the same as that of Mercurj-. The
bolis is now further away than Saturn, hut has not yet got beyond

Uranus."

   From a comparison together of some of the principal descriptions of the
detonating meteor of the 7th of October, 1808, Mr. W. 11. Wood considers that

its point of first appearance was between 80 and 100 miles above Avranches,
in the north of France, and tliat it descended in about five seconds, Avith a
luminous course of about ISO miles, to a height of not more than eight miles
above the English Channel, twenty miles from Hastings, in the direction of
Dieppe. The detonation distinctly heard at Paris would, in this case, arise
from an earlier portion of the meteor's flight. In relation to the height and
other particulars of tins meteor, the following remarks of the Abbe Lecot, of
Noyon (Les Mondcs, vol. xviii. p. 333), proceeding upon the basis of good

observations, deserve attention.

    " The principal remai'kable feature of the fireball of the 7th of October,
18G8, was its vast volume, much larger than that of any other meteor seen

for many yeai-s. Two other circumstances appeared also to be of some im-

portant interest ; viz. 1st, the immense distance to which the series of deto-
nations was heard over an area of more than eighty leagues (190 miles) in
width, incompai-abl}' surpassing the distance to which the loudest claps of
thunder, or the discharges of the largest cannons can be heard. If, more-

over, the statements of the majority of the observers may be trusted, the in-

terval between the bursting of the meteor and the sound of the report was so
great that the phenomenon mnst have taken place at a prodigious height.
Less than five minutes cannot be allowed, on the most moderate estimation,
from the explosion of the meteor to the arrival of the first sound of the
report; and this would imply a distance of more than twenty-five leagues
(sixty miles). Taking into account the direction of the meteor as seen by
the observers, it would be difficult to admit a height of less than twenty

leagues (forty-eight miles). This height is confidently within the limits

which it would be necessary to assign to it when the greater number of exact
descriptions of the meteor given by competent observers are taken into

the account.

   " The second peculiarity which appears hitherto to have been overlooked
is that the meteor was not solitarj', but appears to have been connected with
a long list of similar appearances, which have been more numerous than
ordinary at this season of the year. Last night (October 19th), on two
occasions, about 8 and 10 p.m., I saw each time, in less than two minutes,
five bolides of considerable brightness, leaving behind them a persistent streak,
and moving from south-east to north-west. Their apparent brightness was

about that of the planet Jupiter. On eveiy previous evening since the 8th
of October, when the sky was clear, I have been astonished at the number of
shooting-stars that have presented themselves, generally without my paying

any particidar attention to record their appearance."

   By extending backwards some of the given apparent paths, Mr. Wood
274 REPORT -18G9,

infers that the direction relatively to the earth, or the ajiparcnt point of ra-

diation of this great meteor, Avas jirobably the radiant T, a general centre of

divergence of shooting-stars near a and y Pegasi during the months from

July to ISTovembcr.

  A collection of fourteen original accounts of the appearance of the great

daylight meteor of the 3rd of jVovember, 186S, was carefully examined by

AMr. Wood, to detennine as accurately as possible its real path.  radiant-

point, or general vanishing-point of the apparent paths prolonged hacl-wards,

near Arcturus, is pretty clearly indicated as the most probable direction from

which the meteor actually approached and entered the earth's atmosphere.

Assuming this direction as established, and the apparent points upon its path

observed by Mr. Wood at Birmingham as certainly very near approxima-

tions to the true positions of the meteor at its first and last appearance, the

comparison of the remaining observations with these fii'st assumptions re-

garding the computed path enables the latter to be at least provisionally

fixed with moderate precision. The point of first appearance of the meteor

was seventy miles over Cuckfield, in Sussex, and its point of disappearance

twenty-five miles over Heme Bay, in Kent. The whole course of about

eighty miles, performed in about three seconds of time, was directed from

the west-south-west, descending at an iucHnation of about 35° to the horizon.

Should the real course of the meteor be assumed to be more nearly from

west to east, the apparent radiant-point would be nearer to e Yirginis than

to Arcturus ; and preserving the same place of first appearance, the point of

disappearance will be found to be at a height of about thirty miles over the

neighbourhood of Calais.

  --Meteors of November 14:th, 1868. From a large number of meteors ob-

served in the United States of America on the morning of the 14th of

November last, Prof. Newton has selected several instances of meteors of

conspicuous brightness, which were simultaneously observed by observers at

distant places. The results, accompanied by two excellently executed plates

of the persistent streaks, some of which presented peculiar features, are given

in the ' American Journal of Science' for May 18G9 (vol. xlvii. p. 399), and

lead to the supposition, from the observed motions of translation and distor-

tion of form of some of the streaks, that a northward current of the upper

air prevailed below an altitude of about fiftj^-four miles, and that above this

level, to a height of about sixty miles, a current of air existed moving

towards the south, succeeded, at a greater height, by another current moving

in a northerly direction.

The double appearance of the streaks observed with the telescope in some

of the meteors of the shower suggests the conjecture, entertained by Prof.

Newton, of an actual duality in the meteor itself; and a very possible ana-

logy may th\;s evidently be recognized among the November shooting-stars

to the double or multiple character, which is a common feature among the

detonating and stone-producing meteors.

   1. Meteor and meteor-streak observed at Newhaven ttc. at Ih. 12m. A.ir.

New York time (see Catalogue). " The central point of the cloud may be

regarded as fifty-four miles high, over N. lat. 40° 43', and AV. long. 76°, and

its course S. 78° W., with an angle of depression of 20° upon the horizon of the

places beneath it. The heights of its eastern and western ends were fifty-nine

and forty-nine miles, or ninety-five and seventy-nine kilometres." In the

earlier part of its course the meteor " passed the meridian of Haverford at a

height of about sixty-eight miles, but may have been visible before it

Aj-eached that point. ...  note in hjs observation of the meteor at Pali-

sades, by 3Ir. Gilraau, would implj- a first altitude of eiglity-fivo or niucty

miles. This estimate, however, is not to be taken strictly."

2. Meteor and meteor-streak observed at Fern Lodge Observatory, Pali-

sades, and at Stamford, Conn., at 2h. 4Sm. A.ir. N^ew York time. Although

the base-lino and the eorrcsponding parallax are small, the two observed paths

agree well together, and give an elevation of fifty-two miles for the end of

the track, and sixty-five tor the beginning, with a length of path of twenty-

Aseven miles.                   portion of the luminous streak, which in the field of view of

a telescope magnifying forty times appeared double, and terminated by au

oval cloud, was, allowing for the inclination and diameter of the field of view,

0"89 mile in length.

3. ileteor and meteor- streak observed at Portland and at Boston, U.S.A., at

A3h. 51m. BOs. a.m. Portland time.  parallax of 53° upon the base-line of

121 miles gives tor the height of the meteor, at a point near the beginning

of its path, seventy-seven miles. The length of the luminous cloud, which

gradually curled up and floated northwarcl as it faded, remaining visible at

Boston for three minutes, must have been ten miles.

4. Meteor observed at the same stations at 5h. 6m. a.m. Portland time. The

altitude of this meteor at disappearance was about forty-eight miles. Its

first appearance, judging from observation, was at a height of nearly 150

miles                           but the track was so near to the radiant,  that a difference of three
                             ;

or four degrees in the apparent length would reduce the first altitude below

100 miles.

  5. Meteor and meteor-streak observed at Newhaven and at New York by

Professors H. A. ISTewton and A. C. Twining, at 5h. 6m. 45s. A.M.Newhaven

time (see Catalogue). The altitude of the beginning and end of the visible

path of the meteor is, from these observations, eighty-five and sixty miles

respectively. The motions of the train seem to indicate an upper current

from the north above that from the south, which was shown by the motions

of the train of the meteor of Ih. 12m. a.m. New York time.

6. Meteor and meteor-streak observed at Boston and Fairhaven, &c., U.S.,

at 5h. 30m. 30s. Boston time. The meteor left a streak, which at Boston

remained visible for seven minutes, drifting northwards ; and at Fairhaven

it also remained visible as a pale cloud for five minutes, widening and becoming

nearly circular and larger than the full moon. The observed paths

agree very well with the necessary conditions, and indicate an altitude of

about fifty-niue miles for the lower part of the cloud. The northward mo-

tion of the cloud showed that it did not penetrate through the upper into the

lower current, which swept away southward the lower part of the train of

the meteor at Ih. 12m. a.m. New York time.

186S, December 10th, lOh. 57m. p.m., London, and Ackworth, Yorkshire

(see Catalogue). The 2-esemblauce between these two meteors in time and

other particulars of their appearance, although singularly close, is only acci-

dental, as the difference of the positions of their apparent paths at the two

places does not agree vrith that wMch would be produced by the efi"ect of

parallax.

    1869, ^laj 31st, about llh. r.M., Cambridge and Paris, &c. (see Cata-

logue). Among the many descriptions of this large detonating fireball, the
apparent path is indicated at very few places with precision. An approxi-

mate detevmiiiation of its real path by means of the reference to certain

stars contained in the careful observations by Mr. Atchison at Cambridge,

and by M. llobinet at Paris, leads to the result that the meteor first appeared

at a height of about seventy miles above Eastbourne in Sussex, and disap-
276 REPORT--18G0.

pcared about tweiaty miles above the English Chanucl, lialfway between North

Foreland and the opposite coast of France. The distance of this course,

about fifty-five or sixty miles from Hawkhurst, Wrotham, and the other

places in Kent where the detonation was distinctly heard at an interval of

about five minutes after the meteor's disappearance, affords a verification of

its correctness, while it is in good agreement with the apparent course of the

meteor as observed at Brussels. The direction of the meteor from near t, (in the

spear-hand) of Bootes is probably an outlying example of the occurrence of

the Eadiant Q,, in Corona, of shooting-stars during the greater part of the

months of May and June.

ISfiO, July 16th, Uh. 35m. p.m., London, Hawklmrst, and Beckenham

(see Catalogue). The small parallax indicated by the observations at the

two latter places of the point of disappearance of the meteor " near the

star e Pegasi " may partly be attributed to the great height of the meteor,

which perhaps prevented any sound of its explosion from being heard, and

partly to the direction of its apparent path, being at both stations nearly

parallel to the straight line joining the two places of observation. The de-

scriptions of the meteor's course at London are not sufficiently exact to afford

Aany confirmation of this result.        similar meteor observed nearly at the

same hour on the same date, in ISGl, was likewise found to disappear at a

great height (sixty-five miles) above the surface of the earth (see Eeport

for 1862, p. 77).

   1869, Aiigust 9th, lOh. 59m. p.m., Hawkhurst and Birmingham (see Cata-
logue). The resemblance of these meteors, like that of the two meteors

almost simultaneously observed on the 10th of December last, is only acci-

dental, the apparent paths at the two places not satisfying the necessary

conditions of identity, although the two meteors approximate to each other
very closely in their remaining features.

                   II. AiJROLITES AND LaEGE MeTEORS.

                                a. Aerolites.

        Daniel's Kreil, Grigua Territory, South Africa, March 20th, 1868.

   The fall of the meteorite was witnessed by a native, who picked it up
whilst still warm. The specimen, which Aveighs 2 lbs. 5 oz., was brought to
England by a weU-known mineralogist, Mr. J. II. Gregory, and analyzed by
Professor Church. In composition it is a meteoric stone, containing much

free iron disseminated through its mass, together with some troilite and
schreibersitc. The following is Professor Church's analysis of the aerolite :

                   Nickel-iron                 29-72

                   Troilite                     G-02

A new mass of meteoric iron, from South Afiica, was also noticed by Mr.

Gregory. It fell in 1SG2 at Yictoria West, and is i^reserved in the Museum

at Cape Town. (Quarterlv Journal of Science for January 1869, No. xxi.

p. 133).

Pnompehu, Camboja, Cochinchiua, 1868, between June 20th and 30th,

                                       about 3'' r.M. (local time).

The meteorite separated into three pieces, of which one fell at the door of
A CATALOGUE OF OBSEllVAflONS OF LUMINOUS METliOttS.                          377

the king's palace, the other two pieces were picked up at a coDsiderable dis-

tance. The fir^jt piece, forwarded to France by M. Lafou, Naval Surgeon,

residing at Pnompehu, is pyramidal, weighing about 2 lbs. (1 kilogr.). It is

covered Avith a black shining crust J^- inch in thickness, in which Jiickel-

iron is scattered in fine grains. The fracture is granitic, and speckled

with dark spots. The substance of tlie meteorite dissolved in muriatic acid

Aleaves a residue of graphite and of crystalline silicates.    portion was sent

to M. Pcyrcmol, Professor at the medical school at Rochefort, for more exact

analysis. (' Les Mondes,' ISGS, Kov. 20th.)

              ]M"amur, Eelginm, 1SG8, July 5th, ll'> 45'° p.ir. (local time).

   During a violent storm a fireball fell on the roof of a house at Namur, and
broke a tile. The fall coincided with a clap of thunder. The only residue
found of the ignited body was a small meteorite weighing about a third of
an ounce (10 grammes) ; some grains of which were detached for analysis,
and the remainder now weighs 137 grains. It is entirely covered -with a
slight crust of olive-colour speckled with bright-yellow, but not crystalline-
looking points, giving evidence of its exposure to a glowing heat. The inte-
rior substance is a friable dark-grey cinder, interspersed with black and
yellow crystals, but without metallic grains. The density, 3-0004, is
rather less than that of ordinary aerolites. It exhibits opposite magnetic
poles at the two ends of its longest axis, and is highly magnetic. Attacked
by hydrochloric acid it is partly dissolved, disengaging siilphuretted hy-
drogen, and leaving a pretty abundant residue containing graphite and free
sulphur. The solution is found by the ordinary tests to contain iron, nickel,
and chromium. (' Les Mondes,' 2ud ser. vol xviii. p. 332.)

                             Ornans, Doubs, Prance, 1868, July 11th.

   The following extract from a French newspaper of September last, an-

--nounces the fall of an aerolite in central France. " On the 11th of July in

the present year " [1SG8] " a meteorite fell at Ornans in the Department of
Do\ibs. M. Pisani has submitted it to analysis, aud he finds that it contains
a very small quantity of nickeliferous iron, a small quantity of chrome-iron-
ore, and magnetic irou-i^yrites ; it is besides very rich in peridot. Its struc-
ture is friable and poroiis, and its general aspect is of a deeper grey colour
than is commonly observed in aerolites." (See M. Pisani's analvsis, in
' Comptes Eenclus ' for Sept. 28, 18G8, vol. Ix^-iii. p. GG3.)

Sanguis, Mauleon, Basses Pyrenees, 1868, September 7th, 2'' 30" a.m.

                                                   (local time).

After a meteor of the usual appearance a report was heard as far as Irun,

on the Spanish border, 50 miles distant from Sanguis, where a meteorite

weighing 4i lbs. (2 kilog.) fell into a small stream, 30 yards from the church,

and broke into pieces. The pieces, which were further broken by those who

found them in search of a supposed hidden treasure, were sent to the Museum

of Geology in Paris, and analyzed by M. Stanislas Meimier. They closely

resemble those of the meteorite of Casale, which fell (on the 29th February)

six months and seven days before the present occurrence, appearing therebj-

to indicate two nodes of this meteoric orbit, intersecting the earth's orbit at

180° apart. The siliceous mass contains grains of nickel-iron, troihte, and

chromite.  (Heport  of M.  A.  Daubre'e,  '  Comptes  Eendus'  for  Nov. 2,  1868

Stonefall after a brilliant meteor, which was seen at I'Orieut, and at

Yannes by M. Arondeau, leaving a long streak, and followed by a violent

detonation. (' Bulletins de I'Association Scientifique do France,' Nos. 123

and 12-1.)

  A large meteor, casting a bluish glare over the whole town, was seen in a

northerly direction from Yannes, and was folloAved in 2| or 3 minutes by a

Aviolent explosion, which shook the doors and windows of the houses.

meteorite, which appears to have been of conical shape, and to have weighed

aboiit 160 lbs. (English), struck the earth, at Kernouve, a few yards from a

young girl, who was the only witness of its fall, and it penetrated a little
more than a yard into the ground. On the following morning it was dug

out, broken in pieces, and the fragments were distributed among the villagers

as mementos of a stone supposed to have fallen from the moon. Unable to

disabuse its possessors of the supposed value of the relics, Professor Felix

Pisani, of Paris, at considerable expense, succeeded in securing possession of

·almost the entire aerolite for his mineral cabinet, where the larger half is

Anow" destined for one of the European museums.  specimen weighing

32 lbs. be presented to the Paris Academy, with a careful analysis of the

meteorite. The interior of the stone presents a dark grey gramilar mass,

with iron-pyrites, and much metallic iron in bright grains, some of them a

few millimetres Avide, and others like thin veins or filaments scattered through

it. The iron-pyrites, although magnetic, is not attracted by the magnet, and

the metallic iron is thus easily separated from it. The entire meteorite is

highly magnetic, and its speciiic gravity is 3-747. Its substance is fused by

the blowpipe to a black magnetic bead, in which the spectroscope reveals the

presence of sodium and calcium. It is partly attacked by muriatic acid; and
a specimen thus treated offered to M. Pisani the following proximate che-

mical analysis :

time watching a faint spot near which it passed, and it was much blacker

than the spot. It took about 1|- second to cross. I also drew the apparent

size of the meteor and of the sun at that moment. By this means I find its

apparent diameter to be 27" approximately, i. e. greater than the mean dia-

meter of Saturn, and less than that of Jiipitcr. To have moved so slowly it

must surely have been beyond the limits of visible meteors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             and if at so great

" I have here taken for granted that it was a meteor, which some may

question.                                               Its motion was perfectly steady,                       quite  unlike a bird crossing the

field of view, which I have often seen. Another person was watching the

spot with me at the time, so that there is coiToborative e\-idence. I was

enabled to take the time, position, shape, direction of flight, apparent size of

the meteor (as a fraction of the sun's diameter), all except the duration, with

great exactness. I may mention about the spot, that it was rywi'te in focus

for very distinct vision."

Kansas, U.S. America, June 6th, 1868, 11'' 40" A.ir. (local time).

   At Manhattan a meteor was first seen in the western sky at an elevation
of about 60°, descending at an angle of 75° to the horizon, and leaving a

luniinous streak which remained visible nearlv a minute. The nucleus, of a

vivid pink colour, was about 15' diameter. It feU in less than one second to

withm 12° of the horizon, where it burst, and thence descended in a double

stream of fire. About 4i minutes afterwards a double report, like 12-pounder

Acannons at a distance of a mile, was heard.                                                                          light-blue cloud remained

at the point of explosion, 1|° long and nearly 1° wide, which remained
visible, without much change of shape, until it was obscured by cirro-cumulus
clouds. The report was heard over an area 120 miles in width, and the
meteor was seen at Topeka, Marysville, Ports Harker and Zarah, and at

other very distant places. Its flight was apparently from south to north.

must have exploded over the country halfway between the Eepublicau and

 --Birmingham. Large meteor seen in dajdight, Nov. 3rd, 1868, 3^ 17°" p.m.

    Mr. Yrood's description of the meteor (see Catalogue) is accompanied by
the following careful drawing and explanations :

   " The meteor was pear-shaped, the rectangular diameters being | and
i the diameter of the moon (fig. 1). The body, brilliant white in front,
and ruby-red near the tail, flickered considerably in transit, and diminished
towards extinction, as represented in the drawing (fig. 2). Eed flames,
or the substance of the meteor, issiied from the nucleus, and extended to-
wards the tail one degree, as shown in fig. 1. The tail, 15° long, resem-
bled ordinary smoke in sunshine ; only a small scctio]i of it is represented in

                                                              Fig. 2.

the figure. The nucleus preserved its intensely white light luitil near the
last 5° of its course, when there was a perceptible diminiition in its lustre ;
its size was tlicn about equal to Yenus. At the time of collapse I thought
it dark red, or non-luminous, probably from the contrast with sunlight, as

the effect of the sun's presence woiild be to deprive the meteor of the tisual

bordering raj^s of light.

   " The same object at night would ceiiaiuly have appeared much larger,
and have produced an extraordinary illumination over England. The path

appeared slightly imdulating, if it were not an optical illusion produced by

the fluctuation of its light.

   A" few clouds were rapidly driving across from the "W.S.W., and the sun

shone brightly yet the meteor stood prominently out, in bold relief, on the
                                                                           ;

    " Travelled from "Worcester to Morton on Thursday last" [Nov. 4th] " with

a lady and gentleman who reside at Morton. They told me that on Wednes-

day last [Nov. 3rd] about 3 o'clock, they were walking from their residence

at Morton to call on some friends nt Toddenham, when they saw a most
brilliant meteor which fell to the earth about a furlong from them. They

described the light from the meteor as extremely bright and white, the sun
shining brightly at the same time. They did not hear any noise from the
motion of the meteor. The gentleman said he thought that he should be
able to find the spot where the meteor fell, and promised to take two of his

men to search for some relic."

   The meteor was also observed at Southam, South Warwickshire, as a large

--fiery body, travelling in the direction of the wind (which was from W.S.W.

 --1 . The August Meteoric Shoiver in 1868. Signor Francesco Denza, Director

of the Observatory at Moncalieri, in Piedmont, has published a pamphlet

of the observations made on the nights of the 9th-12th August in Italy,
comprehending some fifteen stations. It appears that the largest number
to be seen by a single observer in one hour was at Florence, viz. 26"9 on the

night of the 10th August, at 13''-14''. Three observers, imder the super-
vision of Prof. Donati, registered :

observations made by the astronomers at Rome.

   In all a catalogue of 393 meteors are given for these five evenings, with
the precise time of observation, apparent magnitudes, and exact positions of
the paths of each observation, determined by the fixed stars ; as well as

colours.

   Each eveningthe chief radiant-point was near rj Persei,with two minor ones

= +near Camelopardus, at about E. A. 40°, Decl. 58°-5, and 49°-5, +58°-5.

The meteors on the evening of the 10th August appeared finer, and gave
longer paths than those of the 9th and 11th August. There appeared to be
a considerable number of meteors on each evening belonging to other radiants
(or sporadic), most of which, however, seemed to lie around, as it were, the

sides of a polygon, with the constellation Perseus itself a centre of them.

    Prof. Serpieri considers that the radiant presented itself rather diffusely,

taking into account all the meteors which passed near k Persei. Projected

00 00on a chart, the tracks approximately crossed each other.

which agrees well enough with the result of Schiaparelli's and Zezioli's ob-

servations for this year.

   At Milan, Prof. 8chiaparelli considered the Perseids of August 1868 more
conformable than usual ; the declination of the radiant-point was determined
more precisely than, perhaps, its right ascension, as about 57°. Zezioli, at
Uergamo, found

    Signer Zezioli, of Bergamo, has also sent to Mr. 11. P. Greg particulars of
about 600 meteors seen in March and April 1868, most of which Mr. Greg
has reduced upon the charts prepared by Mr. A. S. Herschel for the British
Association, and the results as to radiants are given in the second edition of
the Atlas of Meteor Chnrts*.

    Mr. 11. P. Greg, at Whitby, considered the principal radiant for tho carher

part of the August shower (from 2nd August to 8th August) as very close

to k Persci, or about E. A. 44°, N. Decl. -|-57°.

ton,' from Bombay to Liverpool, reports that on the 14th inst., when thirty-

eight miles S.S.AV. of Kinsale (N. lat. 51° 42', W. long. 8° 31'), from 2h. a.m.

till after daybreak, meteors appeared to be bursting in every direction, like

innumerable rockets flying across the heavens. The principal direction was
from S.E. to N.W. The weather was rather overcast at first." Liverpool

Mercury, Nov. 28th, 1868.

   From the logs of various vessels transmitted to him for analysis, Captain
H. Toynbec, head of the Ocean-Meteorological Department of the Board of

Trade, has kindly extracted, at the solicitation of the Committee, the follow-
ing entries, in which the occurrence of this star-shower is noticed as having
been observed at sea.

    Extract from the log of the ship ' Spray of the Ocean,' Capt. P. Slaughter,

from Bombay to Liverpool, " Nov. 14th, 1868, N. lat. about 15°, W. long,
about 32°" [in the N.E. trades of the Atlantic Ocean].--" From midnight
until daylight a continual succession of meteors ; countless ; many of them

of great magnitude and briUiaucy, their direction mostly from between N.E.

and N.W. towards the latter point. Their tracks, also, mostly parallel to the

horizon, at altitudes from about 10° to about 35."

   Under the same date and hour, in a corresponding position of the S.E.
trades, where no lightning is usually seen, an entry in the log of another
vessel contains a memorandum of the appearance of constant lightning.

--290 REPORT 1869.

    In an excellent meteorological register kept on board of the ship ' Siberia,'
between Boston and 'New York, by Captain Mostyn, there is recorded on the
night of the 13th and early morning of the 14th of November, 1868,
" Meteors glancing from east to west, at an average rate of five or six per
minute, at times leaving a luminous track extending 15° or 20°, which re-
mained visible 4 or 5 minutes. The night being perfectly clear gave an ad-
ditional effect to the gorgeous display."

  A good Weather-register kept by Captain C. T. Eaymond, on board of the

ship ' British India,' gives a description of the shower as it appeared to him

in southern latitudes.

  --"November 13th, 1868, at lOh. 30m. p.m. in S. lat. 2G° 3', W. long. 27°

37'. -A perfect shower of shooting-stai's commenced, and continued until
the rising sun extinguished their light. It might be best compared to a
shower of rockets ; for, like them, they left long trains behind, moving con-
fusedly in aU directions, some falling perpendicularly, some obliquely, some
horizontally describing curves, and some even slightly ascending. Some

shone with a bright green light, exploding at last into many pieces, but

without report ; some "ndth a dull red, and some with a faint yellow. It re-
sembled in every respect a similar shower which I witnessed in Bombay,
14th November, 1866. At times the meteors fell as dense as snow-flakes.

    " I could not detect any uniformity, either with regard to the point of the
heavens whence they started, or whither they fell. Most fell perpendicu-
larly, and with a prodigious velocity."

   The following description of the meteoric shower in America, as observed
at Haverford College, Pa., by Prof. Samuel J. Gummere, was received, at
the time of its occurrence, by the Committee from Mr. B. V. Marsh :

   "Meteoric Shower, November 13-1 4th, 1868, as observed at Haverford

College, Pennsylvania, ten miles west of Philadelphia. Latitude 40° 0' 46",
longitude 5h. Im. 13s.

   " The watch commenced at lOh. 45m. p.m., November 13th. About eleven
o'clock two or three very fine meteors were seen coming from the direction
of Leo, which was yet below the horizon. At llh. 17m. one directly from
Leo. The train, of a spiral form, remained visible ten minutes near the con-

stellation Perseus. Seventeen minutes later another in the south-west ex-
hibited a train of similar form for the space of seven minutes. Persistency
and brilliancy of train, with variety of colour, continued to be a marked
feature of the whole display.

   " At midnight about two hundred meteors had been counted. From this
time the reckoning was as in the following Table :

                       h
A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS, 291

   " At Ih. 10m. the finest meteor of the night was seen. It appeared near
the Pole-star, increasing in brilliancy as it approached Cassiopeia, and
vanishing near and /3i.- Cassiopeia; with a flash of extraordinary brilliancy.
The train at first had a direction nearly parallel to the line of these two
stars, and about 15° in length. Immediately it commenced to spread, and
soon assumed the form of an inverted S, thus i. Then the form became
that of an eUipso with a hollow ellipse at each of the two foci, aU the time
drifting slowly towards a Andromeda. At Ih. 55m. the train was still
faintly visible at c Andromedae, the whole time of visibility exceeding forty-

five minutes.

   " At about 4h. 30m., and at 4h. 31m. two meteors left trains in the \-icinity
of Sirius and h, of Canis Major, each assuming the form of the Greek 12, and

continuing visible together for several minutes.

   " As day began to dawn the meteors, which shot down towards and below
Yenus, were in many cases of a bright red or crimson colour.

    " Man}^ unconformable meteors were observed during the night, and the

tracks of many of these corresponded to a radiant between the Pleiades and

the Haiades.

    " In several cases the remarkable phenomenon was noticed of a disappear-
ance, and almost immediate reappearance, as of a light extinguished and re-

kindled.

    " In general the finest meteors were scon in the north and north-west."
   The state of the weather in England on the night of the 13-14:th of
November was not in general favourable to observations of the shower^
Yet a clear condition of the skj' beginning to prevail at Glasgow at 3h.
30m. A.M., and being finally established at 4h. 30m. a.m., a perfect view of
the principal portion of the display was obtained by Prof. Grant. The
meteors resembled those of the 14th of November, 1866, in three or four
instances leaving streaks which remained visible for two or three minutes
after the disappearance of the meteor. Their colour was white, in some in-
stances with a slight tinge of red, and the colour of the streaks was less
inclined to green than in the former shower. Three or four of the meteors
far exceeded -Jupiter in brightness, but not equalling the planet Yeni;s, which
shone at the same time with intense brilliancy in the east. Their rate of
frequency appearing to increase, their number observed in successive minutes

was recorded fr&m 4h. 56m. a.m. until 6h. 5ra. a.m., when 256 meteors had
been counted by one observer. The number really visible during the in-
terval of one hour and ten minutes was in all probability three times as great
as this, or as many as seven or eight hundred. The time of greatest fre-
quency was observed at 5h. 15m. a.m., the number afterwards diminishing

considerably during the continuance of the observations. In the successive

   Shortly after six o'clock, while the shower was still active, although the
period of its greatest intensity seemed to have already passed, the sky became
cloudy, and no further observations could be made. (Monthly Notices of the

morning of the 14th of November, until Ih. 57m. a.m. ; it was clear from this

time until 2h. 50m. a.m., and during this interval forty-six fine meteors were

observed, and their apparent paths described. The number of meteors at

this  time Avas  very  great,  both  large  and  smaU,   and  quite  bewildering
                                                                                                                    ;

several large meteors were present at the same time, and all could not be

observed. The sky then became overcast until 3h. 53m. a.m. It was clear

but hazy from 4h. to 4h. 23m., when clouds began to collect increasingly

until 4h. 48m. a.m., after which time the sky was overcast throughout the

night. Sixty-nine fine meteors were observed, some of which were exceed-

ingly brilliant, leaving streaks varying in duration to more than one minute.

When the sky was cloudy, lightning-like flashes were frequently observed

until after six o'clock, evidently connected with large meteors, lighting up

the whole sky as several of the meteors were observed to do Avhen the

Asky was clear.  meteor which burst, and left a streak for eight seconds

midway between y Leonis and Mars, was without motion. The majority of

bright meteors observed Avere conformable to tlie radiant in Leo, other

radiant-points which were discernible being generally connected with the

smaller meteors.

   The 'Times,' Dec. 7th, 1S68, contained a letter from Dr. J. M. Hamilton,
describing the meteoric shower as it appeared in Shetland. The meteors
were abundant from 3h. 30m. a.m. until sunrise, sometimes appearing two
or three at once, many of them brighter than Venus, and a few so bright
that one could have read ordinary print, for an instant, by their light. The

streaks were  bright white, or  in   some   cases of  a  bluish  or  reddish  tinge
                                                                                                   ;

those left by some of the brightest meteors remained visible for one to three

miniites, and were even visible towards daybreak. The sky was generally

clear, and when it was partly overcast the meteors shone between the in-

terstices of the clouds. The point in Leo from which the meteors appeared

to emanate remained stationary among the fixed stars from 3h. 30m. a.m.

until nearly the time when the sun rose.

A letter from Mr. G. T. Kingstown, Director of the Toronto Magnetic Obser-

vatory, in the ' Times ' of December 8th, states that the sky was clear, except

between oh. and 6h. a.m., on the morning of the 14th of November, and that

3000 meteors were counted before that hour, 99 per cent, of the meteors radia-

ting from the constellation Leo. Some, which exceeded Sirius in brightness,
exhibited a variety of colours. The luminous streaks often continued visible
from two to four minutes. The following Table shows the number of meteors
seen at different parts of the night, together with the state of the sky :-

   At Rome, on the night of the 13-14th of November, 1868, the meteors
began to appear about midnight, with diffuse light in the N.N.E. and N.E.,
several meteors being seen near the Lion's " 8ickle " at 12h. 9m. From 12h.
yOm. until Ih. 20m. an interval of cessation occurred, in which very few-
meteors appeared ; but at Ih. 10m. a splendid fireball made its appearance in
the Lynx (see Catalogue). From Ih. 30m. to 2h. 30m. a shower of meteors
appealed in all parts of the sky, radiating from a point at the centre of the
stars y, e, ^, Z, t] Leonis. In theN.E. anclN.N.E. directions only, ninety me-
teors were counted in two hours. The maximum, which was also noted at the
same time by Prof. PinelK at Clvita Vecchia, took place at 4h. 50m. a.m.,
on the 14th. The total number of meteors visible between midnight and
6h. A.M., in aU parts of the sky, was probably not less than 3000. (Annuaire

                   Total:--At Moncalieri, 400;

The meteors seen after midniglit presented the same appearance as those

of IS'ovembcr 14th, 1866, leaving brilliant streaks which often remained

visible for several seconds. Their brightness exceeded that of Jupiter or

"Venus, of a reddish line. Their directions were all conformable to a radiant-

point in Leo, situated exactly between y and 4 of that constellation. The

agradual increase of the horary numbers shows that the maximum was not

attained, and that the meteoric shower probably commenced a few hours

before midnight at Moncalieri. At the neiglibouriug station of Mondovi,

where the sky was partially clear from 4h. until 4h. 15m. a.m., eighteen

bright meteors were counted in the few clear spaces ; and after this time,

when the sky was completely overcast, two meteors and fifteen lightning-

like flashes were seen through the clouds by Prof. Bruno, in the space of a

quarter of an hour, between oh. 30m. and 5h. 45m. a.m.

On the night of the 14th-15th, observations of meteors in Piedmont were

prevented by bad weather at all the stations. (Letter from Father P. Denza

to the Secretary of the Committee.)

At the Royal Observatory of Madrid the horary number of meteors did not

surpass six or eight on the night of the 12th-13th, and before midnight on the

night of the 13th. From that time until 2h. a.m. on the 14th 200 meteors were

counted by two observers, among which six or seven bolides illumiuated the

country round the observatory with the brilliancy of moonlight. The radiant-

point of aU the meteors was in Leo. Between 2h. and 3h. a.m. the number

Aof meteors seen by the two observers rose to 350 in one hour.               splendid

fireball (see Catalogue) appeared at 2h. 33m. a.m. Between 3h. and 4h. a.m.

the number of meteors seen remained about the same as in the previous hour,

after which time they became more frequent ; and between 5h. and 5h. 30m.

A.M. twenty meteors could be counted in a minute. One meteor in every

ten was then brighter than a first-magnitude star ; their course was short,

especially near the radiant-point, which was close to rj Leonis. After 5h.

30m. A.M. the intensity of the shower began to decline, the approaching

dawn at the same time obscuring some of the smallest meteors.
   The majority of the nuclei were bluish, many white, a few bright red,

and a very few bright emerald-green. The maximum probably occurred

soon after daybreak, as thirteen bright meteors were counted between 6h.

and 6h. 35m. a.m., when Mars, Sirius, and even Venus had disappeared, and

the last meteor observed was recorded five minutes before the sun rose.

During the night of the 14th-15th, as on that of the 12-13th, the number

Aof meteors was very small.          large fireball must, however, have appeared

at 12h. 20m. a.m. (see Catalogue), as its bright persistent streak remained

visible for several minutes.

   The appearance of the maximum of the shower iii 1868 was accordingly

chiefly visible in America, and the first commencement of the shower was

not discernible in Europe. Although less dense in its frequency, yet in the

greater extent of its duration, and uniformity of its structure, the meteoric

                * Dining these lialf-hours the sky was partly overcast.

cloud in 1868 considerably surpassed that traversed by the earth on the

13th-14th of JN'ovember, 1866.

 --3. Meteoric Shower of December 12th, 1868. The cloudy and unsettled

state of the weather in England on the periodical night of the annual return

of this meteor-shower prevented any continuous observations of shooting-

Astars.  considerable shower of meteors was, nevertheless, noted by Mr.

Wood, at Birmingham, who reports as follows :

" Some meteors were observed on the 10th, but the overcast state of the

skies on the nights of the 11th, 12th, and 13th prevented observations re-

quisite to fix the time and intensity of the maximum (except within wide
limits). An hour's observation, however, on the morning of the 12th gave

evidence of a good display, namely, twenty meteors per hour for one observer,

of which 53 per cent, radiated ^'ery accurately from Gcminorum, and the

--remaining 47 per cent, from the coexistent radiants, Ga, LG, Eg, EG. The

shower presented the usual features, meteors white, with an occasional

bluish tint, brief in duration and traiuless."

 --4. Meteoric Showers of Januanj 2nd, April 11th and Jpril, 20th, 1869. At

London and Manchester the sky on the night of the 2nd of January was densely

overcast. On the night of the 3rd the sky was remarkably clear in the

neighbourhood of Loudon. Mr. Crumplen, and two other observers, watch-

ing there, independently, for several hours failed, however, to get a glimpse

of any shooting-stars. If the shower took place on the previous night it

must accordingly have been short-lived, and its limits must have been de-

fined within very narrow bounds. Mr. Crumplen also watched for meteors

on the night of the 24th of December, 1868, when the sky was partially

clear, without success. The unfavourable character of the weather for ob-

servations of luminous meteors in England throughout the last winter and

early part of the spring was equally attended by negative results on the

10-llth, and 20th of April, 1869.

At Moncalieri, in Piedmont, forty meteors were observed on the evening

of the 11th of April, of which two were bolides (see Catalogue) whose

apparent paths were accurately recorded. Two other bohdes appeared on

the same evening with such briUiancy that the attention of all the seven

observers stationed on the terrace of the observatory, and looking towards

different parts of the sky, was di-awn towards them by their light. Eather

Denza is preparing for publication the observations of meteors made in

Piedmont during the first four months of the present year, among which the
number of bolides recorded has been unusually large.

   On the morning of the 21st of April, 18G9, between 2h. and 4h. a.m.,

      ^

eighty-four meteors were counted at Moncalieri, of the usual characteristic

brightness, and radiating, with the general uniformity of the meteors of this
shower, from a point in the neighbourhood of the constellation Lyra. (Bul-

letins of the Eoyal Academy of Belgium for June 1869, vol. xxvii. p. 632-4.)
   In the Meteorological Biilletin of the Observatory of Urbino for April and

May, 1869, Prof. A. Serpieri records the apparent paths of forty-one shooting-

stars, observed during the evenings of those months                                                                                                                                                                                                                  nine of which were ob-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

served in Ih. 10m. on the morning of the 21st of April. The last of these

nine April meteors was of red colour, moved slowly, as if resisted in its

flight, and left sparks of light upon its track. In a reply to Prof. Serpieri,

who sent these observations to him at Milan, Prof. Schiaparelli writes :

"Seven of the nine meteor-tracks proceed from a radiant-point at about

E.A=267°, N. Dccl.= +35°. The radiant-point of the Comet I., 1S61, is at

about E. A.=270°-4, N. Decl.= + 33°-5.

   Mr. Greg observed a fireball, three times as bright as Jupiter, on the evening

of the 9th, at lOh. 23m. p.m. It was bluish white, and lasted one second,
commencing at y Pegasi, and proceeding 12° or 15° in a direct course from
7j Persei. The meteors on the night of the 10-1 1th were bluish white, of
short course, and leaving momentary streaks in those of first and second
magnitude, and dull yellowi.sh-red in the smaller stars ; they radiated from

near ri, h Persei, instead of from Cassiopeia as during the previous years, or

from B Camclopardi as on the preceding night, and were about twice and a

half as frequent as on the evening of the 9th, coming occasionally in groups
of two or three in a minute, after a lull of five or six minutes without any

appearance of a shooting-star. No large meteors were seen on the nights of

the 10th and 11th.

At Broadstairs, in Kent, Mr. George Chapman noted the appearance of

eight meteors, about the average briglitncss of second-magnitude stars, two

of which left momentary trains, during the half-hour from 9h. to 9h. 30m.

in less than two seconds. Their colour was principally white, and the

apparent paths of all were remarkable for the uniformity with which they

radiated from a point about midway between y Persei and the bright stars

of Cassiopeia. On the niglit of tlic 11 th the sky was overcast.

   The particulars of the observations of the meteoric shower at Birmingham
are summed up by Mr. W. H. "Wood in the following remarks :

       Date and interval of observation.
298 REPORT-- ISG'J.

  A letter from M. Amadee GuiUemiu to the Secretary of the Committee,

describes the state of the sky, at Paris, on the night of the 10th of August
as overcast, and, accordingly, unfavourable for observations of the August

meteoric shower.

  --General Radiant-points of Shoot inr/stars. Copious lists of shooting-

stars observed in Piedmont and Italy during the last two years have been
communicated by their authors to the Committee, whose object it has been
to reduce them, for comparison with the results obtained from the British
Association Catalogue, Avhenever a constant divergence a2:)peared to present
itself among the meteors, to specific radiant-points. In this inquiry their
labours have met with encouraging success by the complete verification of a
considerable number of the known radiant-points, and by the means of rec-
tifying the positions and durations of others, less certainly established by the
paucity of previous data, afforded by the additional observations.

   Mr. E. P. Greg having lately projected on the Celestial Maps, in use by
the Committee of the British Association, about 150 meteor- tracks, from
observations made last year under the care of Signer Denza, Director of
the Observatory at Moncalieri in Piedmont, and since published in the Me-
teorological Bulletin of that Institution, has been enabled to redetect and

verify the radiants AG^, M^, ^, M^, MG, Aj, , ; and more slightly the radiants
A3, J, SGj, S^, 3, NG, M^, -. The observations in question were made on the

evenings of the 7th-19th January ; and 30th -January to 6th February, 1868.

Two new radiants were also fati'ly obtained, not before noticed by Greg

--and Herschel, one for the evenings between the 29th of January and

(?) 6th of February, near Quadrans, R. A.=223°, N. Decl. 54° ; and the other
near /n Eridani, R. A. =73°, S. Decl. 2°, for the evenings of the 9th-19th
January, and at r Orionis, E. A. =68°, 'N. Decl. 6°, for 30th January to 5th
(? nth) of February.

   The former of these, at Quadrans, is evidently identical with Heis, K^, at
R. A. 227°, N. Decl. 60°, for 15th-31st January, but must certainly not be
identical with the special shower, K^, 3, of Greg and Herschel for January
2nd, which, there is good reason to believe, is a shower of only twenty-four

hours' duration.

   Mr. Greg also finds in Signer Zezioli's observations, made at Bergamo,

April 25th-May 3rd, 1868, abundant confirmation of the radiants W, WG,

Q^, DG^ ; also of N^, OZ, and OZ^.

    Prof. Serpieri, in the ' BuUetino Meteorologico ' of TJrbino for Aug-ust 1868,
gives a radiant for eight shooting-stars on the 11th of July, 1868, the posi-
tion R. A. 200°, N. P. D. 35°, which almost exactly agrees with the radiant

MG. for July Ist-llth, as determined last year by Mr. Greg (Report for 1868,

p. 403) from Signer Zezioli's observations, made at the same time at Bergamo,
the position determined being at R. A. 210°, IV". P. D. 35°, as given in the 2nd
edition of the ' Celestial Atlas,' published last year by the British Association.

    Considerations of the space usually allotted in these Reports to observations
of luminous meteors (which in the present year is amply occupied), and a
sense of the scientific importance of the papers communicated, during the
past year, by their authors to the Committee, will only permit a list of their

titles and of the principal contents of their pages to be here appended. The
annually decreasing splendour of the ISTovember meteor-shower, and the

absence of its attendant observations, wiU, in a future year, enable the
recent contributions of special importance to meteoric literature to be care-
fully reviewed.

by the same author, is a brief but lucid lecture, delivered to a popidar

audience at the Museum of Natural History and Philosophy in Florence, on

--the subject of the recent discoveries incometic and meteoric astronomy. The

aiithor, in common with Schiaparelli, regards comets, aerolites, and shooting-
stars as bodies of a common origin in the nebulous matter of the universe,
differing only from each other in the degree of concentration Tvrought in them

by the effects of universal gravitation and of time. The gaseous and self-

luminous character of the nucleus of Tempel's comet, observed by Huggins,

which is not referred to by Father Denza, differing so essentially from that of

aerolites, does not receive any very obvious or satisfactory explanation on

this hj'pothesis.

   3. ·' Etudes geometriques sur les Etoiles filantes," par G. M. Goulier (in

--8vo, pp. 154, with plates : Mctz, F. Blanc, 1868). The principal object of the

work is an instructive manual intended to direct the observations of shooting-

stars projected by the recently instituted Meteor- Committee of the Imperial

Academy of Metz. The phenomena of visibihty, rate of apparition, appa-

rent position, and hourly variation of the radiant-point, and the calculations

of the real heights, velocities, and dates of the periodical rctiirns of shower-

meteors are discussed, with mathematical formulae intended to adapt the

careful observations of luminous meteors conveniently and with increased

accuracy to the development of the new cosmical theory of shooting-stars.

The same clear arrangement and demonstrations of all the fundamental pro-

positions of Professors Newton and Schiaparelli on the apparitions of shower-
meteors and their orbits are given in subsequent chapters of the work. The
sixth and last chapter contains a review of the conjectures to which the

cosmical theory of luminous meteors has given rise, and suggests some brief

considerations on the possible identity of shooting- stars and aerolites.

observers of determining by direct observations the real velocities of the
meteors, relative to the earth ; and, secondly, in the manner adopted by
Professor Newton, of determining the periodic time of revolution by exam-
ining the dates of ancient star-shower records. The description of the first

of these two methods, adopted by astronomers fi'om the time of Ben-

zenberg and Brandos, occupies the principal and most extensive portion of

the narrative. The third, and last method, which led Schiaparelli to discover
the quasi-cometary character of the meteor-orbits by calculating the velo-

cities of shooting-stars from the laws of their annual and diurnal variations

of frequency, receives full exposition in the last few pages of the pamphlet.

                                                                        x2

reduction and oxidation of various minerals (see Eeport for 1868, p. 415),

led M. Daubree to the conclusion that the latter process of imperfect scori-
fication, like that which the materials of the earth's crust appear to have

comphtely undergone by oxidation, represents the original process of forma-

tion of meteorites. In the rare aluminiferous meteorites of Juvenas, Jonzac,
Stannern, and Petersburgh (U. S.), the crystallization, like that of granite on

the earth, can only have taken place in the presence of water ; since their
felspathic ingredients are converted into glass or vitreous slags by fusion.

Some new points of interest on the classification of meteorites *, and on the
recent acqiiisitions in the Paris Museum of Geology of aerolitic specimens, are

added by M. Daubree to the former chapters of his original researches,
which are otherwise reproduced in the present pamphlet without change.

Among the recent specimens acquired at Paris, not less than 950 perfect

aerohtes of the stonefall of Pultusk (1868, January 30th), varying from

   6. In ' Cosmos ' for January 18th, 1868, M. Stanislas Meunier communi-

cates a new chemical test for distinguishing the protosulphuret of iron (Fe S)
from the ordinary terrestrial magnetic sulphuret or pyrrhotine (Fe, SJ. The

former, even when slightly supersulphurctted, precipitates metallic copper from

its solutions ; but when the proportion of sulphur approaches to that contained

in pyrrhotine, and in the case of the mineral pyrrhotine itself, no such pre-

cipitate is produced. The fact that the magnetic sulphuret of iron (troilite)
found in meteorites remains inactive, or " passive," when placed in a solution

of sulphate of copper, leads M. Meunier to conclude that its chemical

formula and mineralogical characters approach more nearly to those of

pyrrhotine (Fe. SJ than to those {ydih. which it is usually compared) of the

Aprotosulphuret of iron, Fe S.  paper by the same author, in the ' C'osmos '

for March 21st, 1868, describes at length the process employed in the labora-

tory of the Paris Museum of Geology for analyzing meteoric irons.

Some remarks by M. Daubree and M. Meunier in the foregoing papers

appearing to admit of theoretical exceptions, the opportunity of reviewing the

facts recently observed regarding the falls of the meteorites in different parts

of the globe, and the conclusions to which they lead in confirmation of M.

Haidinger's views of their interpretation, is made the occasion of a clear

exposition by the eminent mineralogist of Vienna of the progress of aerolitic

science during the long time in which it has engaged his attention, and

especially of the rapid strides which, owing to the able geological and astro-

nomical inquiries which have .recently been devoted to the subject, it has

principally been enabled to make during the last few years.

     1°. Meteoric irons consist of a small number, only, of different minerals
combined together in variable proportions.

    2°. These minerals, which may be called j^foximate inriredients of meteor io

irons, possess physical and chemical characters which enable them to be
separated from each other in a state of pnrity.

    3°. The majority possess a definite composition, capable of being expressed

in simple chemical formulfc.

    4°. They are not mixed together at random in the masses which they

compose, but their positions relatively to each other obey certain fixed laws.
    5°. Lastly, proximate chemical analysis of meteoric irons affords the only

effectual means of obtaining a satisfactory classification of these bodies.

    " Shooting-stars on the morning of November 14th, 1867," by H. A.

Newton (American Journal of Science for January 1868, vol. xlv. p. 78),

contains a discussion of the principal observations of frequency of the

meteors, and a curve showing the time of maximum of the star-shower, as

observed in the United States, together with some remarks on its geogra-
I^hical extent of visibility, on the probable width of the stream, and its
possible connexion with the comet observed in China on the 25th of October,
A.D. 1366.

   " On the ' Shooting-stars ' [of jSTovember 1867] as observed at Shanghai,"

--by B. V. Marsh (Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. x.

p. 384). The following notes of a meteor-shower which occurred in China
on the 15th of November, 1867, were received by Mr. Marsh from Mr. B. R.
Lewis, TJ. S. Deputy Consul-General at Shanghai.

   Log of U. S. steamer ' Ashuelot,' Capt. Febiger, at Shanghai : " Nov.
15th, 1867, 4'' to S^ a.m. Large number of shooting-stars to the N. and E.
falling to the N. ; visible until broad daylight. Clear and cold ; light N.W.

winds."

 --Log of JJ. S. steamer ' Monocacy,' Capt. Carter, at Shanghai : " November

15th, 1867, from midnight to 4'' a.m. At 2'' a.m. observed a number of
meteors falling from the westward towards the east. This shower of meteors
continued till 4^ a.m., decreasing in number from 3'', seven or eight being the
largest number visible at one time.

   " From 4" to 8" a.m. Between 4'' and 5'' observed several meteors falling

to the eastward."

   Extract from the 'Shanghai News Letter' of January 16th, 1868[*].--
" From Mr. 0. B. Bradford of the TJ. S. Consular Service we obtain the fol-
lowing glowing account of the meteoric shower of 1867, as witnessed by him
not far from the great wall of China. It was on the morning of the 15th of
November, while on his way back from the Nankow Pass, and when about
fifty miles N.N.W. of Pekin, that Mr. Bradford observed these grand pheno-
mena of the heavens. The grand spectacle was displayed in an arc of not

less than 120° in the north-east part of the sky, which at times seemed to
be rent in twain, from about 25° of the zenith, by solid masses of luminous
bodies, of various magnitudes and surprising brilliancy, darting across his
vision. Several hundreds [! !] of these meteors would be visible at the same
time, all emitting the most intense light, and the nebulae of the largest lasting
sometimes three minutes. One of the largest shone with brightness above
that of the moon as it issued from about 15° of the north star and passed to

the horizon, giving off as it fell coruscations of various bright colours, and,

when disappearing, a nebula, which resembk^d a waterspout in high latitudes.
It was not until 6^ 30TM a.m. that approaching dawn and sunrise put an end

 to the display."

    In reference to these accounts, it is stated by Mr. Marsh that the observa-
tions of 1866 afforded no ground for expecting this Asiatic display of 1867,
 since the star-shower appeared and disappeared in the United States of
 America within two hours of its appointed time, or at about 4'' 30"" a.m.,

New York time, on the 14th of November. Since the latter hour would,
from the difference of longitude (12*^ 40" east of New York), and from the

commencement of the day earlier (by that space of time) in China than in
America, correspond to about 5^* 10"" p.m. on the afternoon of the 14th of
November at Shanghai, it follows that the Chinese shower of November 15th,
1867, was observed ten or twelve hours later, in absolute time, than the time

of the great appearance of the November meteors in the United States. On

the other hand, it has since been pointed out by Mr. Marsh, in a more recent

communication to the Committee, that the maximum of the great November

star-shower of 1865 was visible in America, and in Europe, on the morning

of the 12>th of November, about twelve hours earlier than corresponded to the
time of the principal apparition of the shower in the years 1866 and 1867.

The central and densest portion of the meteor-stream through which the

earth passed in the latter years appears accordingly to be flanked on either
side by lateral and somewhat less dense but wider meteoric currents at a dis-
tance from the orbit of the main stream, which the earth crossed in about
twelve hours on the mornings of the 13tli of November, 1865, and 15th of

November, 1867. The Asiatic shower of the latter date accords almost exactly
in its epoch with the unexpected reappearance last year in Europe and Ame-
rica of the great display of meteors on the morning of the 14th of November

1868.

    The following extract of a letter from Mr. Marsh to the Secretary of the
Committee, dated Philadelphia, January 15th, 1869, contains an ingenious
and clear statement of the above interesting result derived from the recent

observations :

   " The Chinese maximum was at about 3'' 30TM p.m. November 14th, Phila-
delphia time, so that we should have been in the centre of that group, or
stream, this year at O"" 30" p.m. November 13th. The shower Avhich we

actually encountered was in fuU progress here by 11'' 30'" p.m., and from the
European observations it is proved to have begun two hours earlier. Whereas
the American sliower of 1867 should have begun at 9'' a.m, November 13th,

and ended at about noon on that day, our shower of this year seems much

more directly to represent the Chinese than the American shower of 1867.

  "We had, on the 13th of November, 1865 (maximum at about 3'' a.m.),

quite a fine display, much exceeding (I judge from your Hcports) yours of

the same year, so that the principal displays of the present series were as

follows :

The comet No. 21 agrees too closely in all its particulars -with the course

of the meteors of the 20th of April, from an observed radiant-point about in

11. A. 27S°-7, N. Decl. 35°, to leave any doi;bt of its connexion with the

star-shower of that date. Dr. Oppolzer, who observed the comet, remarks

that the visible connexion between its tail and nucleus was so slight as to

appear as if it would shortly be dissolved                                                                                                                                                                     and the possibility that the comet

tion to account for the extremely irregular returns of this great meteoric

shower. The occurrence of a meteoric shower with a radiant-point in

Cerberus (E. A. 273°-0, N. Decl. 2,5°-5), observed by Professor Herschel on

the morning of the 13th of April, 1864, agrees well with the elements of the

same comet as computed by Oppolzer.

(see Eeport for 1868, p. 403) the elongated radiant Aj^, j^, producing meteors
in November and for some weeks earlier, is situated between a and S Cassio-

peite from E. A. 10° to 25°, and N. Decl. 54° to 60°. The radiant is sup-

posed to be continuous with A,, (Nov. 23-Dec. 18), near B Camelopardi,

whose position is about at E. A. 45°, N. Deck 60°. Observations on shooting-

stars on the nights of the last week of November and first week of December

exact position of their point of radiation.

Yotra Committee have much pleasure in reporting that during the year con-
siderable progress has been made towards the assimilation of weights and
measures in all countries. As briefly stated last year, the Xorth-German

Confederation, by a law dated 13 June 18G8, adopted the metre as the basis
of measures and weights, and they resolved to take as the primaiy standard
measure of length the platinum bar in the 2>osscssion of the Prussian Govern-
ment, which in the year 1863 was found by a Commission appointed by the
French and Pnissian Governments to be equal to 1-00000301 metre at the
temperatm-e of melting ice by comparison with the metre deposited at the
Archives in Paris. Whilst adopting the metric nomenclature, the Xorth-
German Confederation added corresponding idiomatic names wherever pos-
sible, as, for instance, the iletre is also called the " Stab " or " EU," the

Centimetre the new " Zoll " or " Inch," the Millimetre the " Strick " or
"Line,'" the Dekametre the "Kette" or Chain, the Litre the "Kanne" or
Pot, the Hetolitre the " Zass " or Cask, the half Kilogram the " Pfund " or
Pound, and the 50 Kilograms or 100 pounds the "Zentner" or Hundred-

weight. In the United States the use of metric weights and measures has
been rendered legal, and they are employed in all post-offices exchanging
mails with foreign countries. In the Postal Convention with this country,
signed at London on the 18th June 1867, the authorized weight of a single
letter was stated to be half an ounce in the United Kingdom, or fifteen grammes

by the metrical scale in the United States. It were much to be desired

that the Post-Office of this country would second the enlightened opinion of

the Americans and adopt fifteen grams as the minimum weight of letters
sent to foreign countries. But still greater progress has been made in the
introduction of the Metric System into India. The question of revising the

Indian system of weights and measures had engaged the attention of the
Government of India at various periods since 1837, and, in consequence of
representations from the Madras Government and the Chambers of Com-
merce, the Government of India passed a resolution in 1864 authorizing
             UNIFORMITY OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.                                                                                            309

the appointment of local Committees in each Presidency to deliberate and

report on the whole matter, with instructions to submit their views to the

Central Committee at Calcutta for their consideration. In course of time,

"when these answers were I'cceived, it was found that in Madras and Bombay,

the North-west Provinces and the Puiyaub, the Committees were in favour

of a uniform system, based on the Imperial, their recommendation being that

the unit of weight should consist of a Seer fixed at two lbs. avoirdupois, that

the Imperial quart should be the unit of capacity, and the Yard and Acre

the units of linear and superficial measure. The Bengal Committee, however,

thinking that the days of the Imperial System were numbered, and that

when all the rest of the world had adopted, or is about to adopt, the French

Metric System it would be a retrograde step to adopt the English weights

and measures, proposed the gradual but complete adoption of the French

Metric System, and their recommendation received the support of the Bengal

Government.

On the 1st October, 1867, Colonel Strachey, the President of the Central

Committee, with the view of bringing forward an expression of public opinion,

published a memorandum in which he supported the proposal of the Bengal

Committee. In his opinion, the assimilation of the English weights to those

of France was a mere question of time, and the existing English system could

not last, and he therefore advocated the adoption of the French kilogram as

the basis of the new system of weights in India. But Colonel Strachey's

memorandum did not meet with the assent of a majority of the Committee,

and he retired from it almost at the beginning of its labours, whereupon the

Committee, with a new President, completed their labours, and concluded by

recommending a new system based on Imperial units with decimal multiples

and binary divisions. Thus the question stood when a Deputation from your

Committee and the Council of the International Decimal Association waited

on Sir Stafford Northcote, the then Secretary of State for India, for the pur-

pose of urging the importance of introducing the Metric System in India; and

it is gratifying to yoiu- Committee to state that, in a despatch dated 1st Feb.

1868, in conveying to the Government of India a full report of the represen-

tation of the Deputation, Sir Stafford Northcote wisely urged that whilst it

would be better for the Committee to endeavour to establish a system more

nearly approaching the best theoretical system than to adopt the English,

the Government should be cautious not unduly to sacrifice practical conve-

nience to theoretical symmetry. Soon after this a change of opinion appears

to have taken place in the Indian Government. A decisive minute was made

by the Commander-in-Chief, Sir W. R. Mansfield, dated 5th September 1868,

in favour of the Metric System. The same was confirmed by the Governor-

General, Sir John Lawrence                                                                                                                  and after the subject had been fully discussed in
                                                                                                                                         ;

Council, the whole matter was summed up in a despatch to the Secretary of

State for India, recommending that the new unit of weight should be a Seer

equal'to the Kilogram, or 2-20o lbs. avoirdupois, and that a system of decimal

multiples and subdivisions of the unit of weight should be accepted as a

fundamental part of the new scale to be recognized by law. The Govern-
ment of India further urged that the best preparation for the general adoption
of the new metric weights would be their introduction and authoritative use
in the first instance by all the Departments of the Government, by all Muni-
cipal bodies, and on the Eailways. On the receipt of this despatch with the
accompanying documents, the Duke of Argyll, the new Secretary of State for

India, remitted the whole question to the Board of Trade, and asked tlicm
whether any measure is under consideration for a change in the weights of
                                                                                        --

this couiitiy. At tliat time, the subject beiug under the consideration of the

Standard Commission, the  answer  was  delayed                                          but as it became known that
                                                                                     ;

the Commissioners were favourable to the introduction of the Metric System,

and that a decided opinion existed in this country in favour of advancing still

further in the policy of the Permissive Act of 186-1, the Duke of Argyll sent

a despatch to the Indian Government appro^dng of the introduction of the

kilogram as the unit of weight throughout British India ; and thus nearly

15,000,000 more of people will in a short time join the large family having

one common system of weights, the adoption of the metric unit of length

being certain to follow at no distant date. From India, with reference to

the many colonies and dependencies of the empire, your Committee waited

upon the Secretary of State for the Colonics, urging the advantage of at least

a permissive law to use the Metric System in all the Colonies, and also the

need of having the system taught in all their schools ; and, with the consent

and cooperation of the Secretary of State, your Committee, in conjunction

with the Council of the International Association, sent a letter to all the

Governors of the Colonics to the same effect. Judging from the great success

achieved in India, we trust it will not be long before a decided uniformity of

weights and measures shall be realized in Canada and Australia, the Cape and

the West Indies, Malta and Gibraltar, in short in every colony of the empire.

In their last Keport your Committee alluded to the unsatisfactory condition

of the law in this country, which, whilst making it permissive to make con-

tracts on the terms of the Metric System, made no provision for the stamping

of metric weights and measures in general use. This anomaly having been

brought by your Committee to the notice of Her Majesty's Government, the

subject was remitted by the Eoard of Trade to the Standard Commission for

their consideration, and your Committee are pleased to state that the second

report of that Commission, just published, recommends the removal of every

difficulty and the fuU and legal introduction of the Metric System. The

resolution of that Commission on the subject is as follows :

"Considering the information wliich has been laid before the Commission,

of the great increase during late years of international communication equallj*

in relation to trade and commerce, of the general adoption of the Metric

System of Weights and Measures in many countries both in Europe and other

parts of the world, and more recently in the Jforth-German Confederation

and in the United States of America, of the progress of public opinion in this

country in favour of the Metric System as a imiform international system of

weights and measures, and of the increasing use of the Meti'ic System in

scientific researches and in the practice of accurate chemistry and engineering                                      1

construction, we are of opinion that the time has now arrived when the law

should provide and facilities be afforded by the Government for the introduction

and use of Metric Weights and Measures in the United Kingdom, and that for

this object Metric Standards, accurately verified in relation to the primary

Metric Standards of Paris and deposited in the Standard Department of the

Board of Trade, should be legalized, and that verified copies of the official

Metric Standard should be provided by the local authorities for inspection of

such districts as may require them." The Commissioners were not favourable

to the compulsory measure on the subject ; but they recommended that
customs duties should be allowed to be levied by Metric Weights and ]\fea-

surcs as well as by Imperial weight and measure ; that the use of the Metric

System concurrently with the Imperial System should be adopted by other

public departments, especially the Post-Office, and in the publication of the

principal restilts of the statistics of the Board of Trade, as well as for the
--

admeasurement and registration of the tonnage of shipping ; and that Mural
Standards of the Metric] System as well us of the Imperial System be
exhibited in public places. Tour Committee regret the recommendation of
the Commissioners to maintain for an indefinite time two legal systems in
general use, it being subject to trouble and confusion. Nor do they agree
with the reason assigned for any hesitation in this matter. It is asserted
that there is no immediate cause for a change for the purpose of internal
trade. But what say the Chambers of Agriculture and the Chambers of
Commerce on the subject? The Barustaplo Farmers' Club recently peti-
tioned Government in the foUowing terms :

   " That your Petitioners, in common with the rest of the community, and
more especially of the farmers, suffer much needless disadvantage, and are
burdened with much unnecessary labour, by the great variety and compli-
cated character of the legal, and still more of the customary, Weights and
Measures in use in the United Kingdom, which add much to the number and

difficulty of the calculations required in business transactions, and deprive your

Petitioners of a great part of the benefit to be derived from the publication of
the prices current at the different markets in different parts of the country.

   *' That while under difterent heads, such as Long Measures, Land Mea-
sures, Liquid Measures, Dry Measures, and Weights of different kinds, for
different sorts respectively of lengths, of sui'faces, of work, and of articles,
dry and liquid, there are at least ten distinct sets of well ascertained, though
utterly unsystematic. Weights and Measures recognized bj^ law, besides an
imknown multitude of customary Weights and Measures iu use, in different
localities in the United Kingdom, your Petitioners hear with envy of the
superior facilities enjoyed by their rivals abroad iu those foreign countries
where a uniform Decimal System, comprising five series only, all equally
easy to be learnt and all founded on the same scientific basis, has been
established by law for the measurement respectively of length, of surface, of

--capacity, of solid bulk and of weight a system which, owing to its obvious

convenience, has either alreadj^ become, or is rapidly becoming, general in
practice wherever legally established.

   " That this System (known as the ' Metric,' because wholly based on the
Metre) was unanimously recommended in 1862, after a full inquiry, by a

Committee of the House of Commons, comprising distinguished men of all

political parties ; and has already been adopted in its entirety by countries
with a population of nearly 150,000,000, and a trade Avith the United King-
dom of nearly £180,000,000 sterling, and adopted in part by countries with
a population of nearly 70,000,000, and a trade with the United Kingdom of
.£50,000,000, each class of countries comprehending some of the most highly
civilized nations in the world, and each, as might be expected, continually
receiving additions, notwithstanding the refusal hitherto of this country and
the United States to do more than render the use of Metric Weights and
Measures permissive, and that of Eussia to recognize it at all.

    " The existing confusion in Weights and Measures in this country and its
Indian and Colonial Empire, equally complained of by the opponents and

supporters of the Metric System, renders the present time, in the opinion of
your Petitioners, particularly favourable for its legal adoption in its entirety;
since a change to this, the simplest, most convenient, and most widely used
System ever yet known, would cause hardly more trouble or inconvenience
than would the rigid general enforcement of our cumbrous and utterly irra-
tional Imperial set of Weights and Measures.

   " Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honourable House to take
31.2 REPORT--1869.

measures for rendering the use of the Metric System not only legal but com-

pulsory, at the earliest practicable period, throughout the United Kingdom

and as many as possible of its dependencies."

The Scottish Chamber of Agriculture have deliberated on the subject of the

grievance of having so many weights and measiu'es in use. Grain is some-

where sold by the quarter or bushel, and elsewhere it is weighed and sold by

the cental or other weight. The practice differs in every county, nay in every

market, in the United Kingdom. The "Royal Commissioners further urge, as

a reason against the immediate complete introduction of the Metric System,

that there are nearly thirty millions of ordinary weights and measures of the

existing Imperial System now in common use. But how many of these are

altogether unreliable ? And is the temporary inconvenience of having to

substitute new weights and measures to be considered a sufficient reason for

delaying a reform of such importance to the trade and interests of the empire?

The example of France and all countries where the Metric System has been

introduced points out that it is necessary, in order to facilitate the change, to

indicate a time when the introduction of the change must be effective, and

your Committee hope that when Her Majesty's Government bring forward a

Bill on the sxibject, the Legislature v>'ill see the necessity of providing that

after a definite time the concurrent use of the Imperial and Metric Systems

shall cease, and the Metric be finally adopted as the new Imperial System of

weights and measures in the United Kingdom.

Your Committee have ahready observed that the Royal Commissioners re-

commended that the Metric Standards should be accurately verified in relation

to the primary Metric Standards at Paris. These standards are a platinum

metre and kilogram, deposited at the Palais des Archives in 1793. But it

Ais not by these that new standards are now made.                                                  copy of these standards

was made at the same time to save the original standards, and for the pur-

pose of verifying the Metric Standards of foreign countries where the Metric

System is adopted ; and this copy was first deposited at the Observatoire,

and afterwards, in 1S4S, transferred to the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers.

The practice, therefore, is to verify any new standard by that copj', which,

notwithstanding the lapse of time, differs very little from the standard

of the Archives. It is objected, however, to such a practice, first, that it is

inconvenient in all cases to resort to Paris for such verification ; second, that

if each country prepares its own standards and in its own way these will be

found to differ from one another, and there may be not one but many metres;

and, third, that the standards themselves are not complete. Upon this sub-

ject your Committee liave recently received a Report of a Committee of the

Physico-Mathematical Department of the Academy of Sciences of St. Peters-

burg, recommending that the different States should be invited to nominate

an International Commission for the purpose of preparing prototype standards

of the metre, and so create a unit of measure truly universal and effectively

international. Your Committee are glad to hear that M. de Jacobi, to whose

able pen we owe the valuable Repoi-t issued by the Committee of Weights and                                                                                     I

Measures for the International Conference in 1867, Avill be present at this

Meeting to advocate this suggestion. The mode of obtaining a correct stan-

dard is a question of administration which may be safely left to the Warden

of the Standards                                                                                   yet your Committee are of ojiinion that the Commission thus
                                                                                                ;

suggested may prove most beneficial, especially in endeavouring to correct

any small scientific defects in the system itself, and in the weights and mea-

sures separately in connexion with it. Your Committee are hajjpy in re-

porting that the Mural Standard, made under their direction, of the iletre
       ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.                           313

 is highly appreciated, and during the year copies of the same have heen
 forwarded for public exhibition at Norwich and Exeter, and to the Harvard
 University in the United States. Your Committee are desirous of making
 further grants of such Mural Standards, but the funds at their disposal do
 not allow them to use these efficient means for diffusing the knowledge of the

 Metric System. Your Committee have much pleasure in reporting that

 considerable stimulus has been given to the study of the Metric System by
 the prizes offered to the students passing the examination of the Society of
 Arts and the British and Foreign School Society on the subject ; and that the
 prize of ^10 offered for the best school-book on the Metric System was gained

by W. C. Vaughan for an excellent treatise on the subject, which your Com-

mittee trust will soon be published and become extensively useful.
    Upon the subject of International Coinage no step has been taken since

 the report of the Royal Commissioners,
    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, has recently enunciated his

views in favour of imposing a seigniorage of about one per cent., and of taking

it from the coia with the view that the sovereign may become identical with

the 25-franc piece. In his opinion, whilst the sovereign would still remain
as a current coin in this country of exactly the same value as now, it would
have the additional advantage that it woiild be identical in value with the
25-franc piece. The subject has been frequently before your Committee,

but they conceive that a general understanding on this and many other points

of extreme difficulty and magnitude should be arrived at by those conversant
with the practical administration of the mints in different countries before
the subject is deliberately submitted for the approval of the country ; and your
Committee content themselves in echoing the recommendation of the Royal
Commissioners on International Coinage, that another International Confe-

rence may speedily be held for that purpose. The question is weU worthy of
the attention of the British Association, and your Committee recommend
that the Council of the British Association should make a representation to
that effect to Her Majesty's Government. In conclusion, your Committee

are persuaded that their efforts have not been in vain in stimulating the

early realization of one uniform system of weights, measures, and coins in
aU countries, an object of the highest importance in the interest of science,

education, commerce, and peace ; but their task being far from complete,
and with a view to labour still further towards that end, they recommend

the reappointment of the Committee, with a grant of at least £50 for the

purpose.

of towns and populous places has a great influence on the preservation of
health and life. Hygienic measures calculated to prevent disease have
therefore come to be regarded even of more importance than the knowledge
gained by two thousand years' experience in the art of medicine.

    Pure air and water are two of the most essential requirements of all
populous places. The removal of water from the surface and from the
 subsoil by some kind of drainage has also been found essential to the healthi-
ness of a place ; but the thing most of all important in its influence on the
sanitary condition of towns &c., and as aftecting the purity of the aii' and
water, is undoubtedly the mode in which the excretal refuse of their

 population is dealt with.

    Even in the most primitive states of society it has always been found
 necessaiy to dispose of excreta and other refuse materials from dwelhngs in
such a manner as to prevent them from becoming a nuisance ; and the most
simple mode of effecting that object was probably the plan prescribed by
Moses to the Jews *.

    The fact that animal excreta are useful as manure has also led, in many
cases, to the adoption of some plan of dealing with them for that purpose, by

which their accumulation in the vicinity of dwelhngs would be prevented to a
great extent ; and in that way no great difiiculty would be experienced in
thinly populated places in devising simple measures sufScient to meet all re-
quirements. Under such circumstances the mode of effecting the object in
view would be a matter to be determined and carried out by the individual re-
sidents of a place. But wherever the population became concentrated in

villages or towns, difficulties arose as to the disposal of excreta or their
immediate removal and use as manure, in consequence of which it became a

practice almost universal to allow them to collect, together with other refuse,
in pits dug in the ground near each house or group of houses, and then at
intervals to remove the accumulated contents of these pits for use as manure.
As the magnitude of towns increased, the difiiculty of thus dealing with
excretal refuse became greater, and the offensive consequences of its accu-
mulation near dwellings more sensible. Hence this subject became more
and more a matter to be dealt with by the local authorities, at first by regu-
lation of the practices adopted by the inhabitants of a place, and eventually
it became a duty to be provided for and performed by the authorities them-
selves in such a way as to ensure the common convenience and well-being

of the population.

    However, the full importance of this subject in other respects was far from
being appreciated until within the last thirty or forty years. It is only
within this recent period that there has been anything like an adequate
recognition of the feet that the sanitary state of dwellings and towns, the
health and mortality of their population, the condition of rivers, and other
matters of importance are, as a general rule, largely influenced by the practices
adopted in regard to excretal refuse. Within that period inquiry and expe-
rience have shown that excretal refuse, besides being offensive and, in some
cases, a great nuisance when accumulated in a state of putrefaction or decay

near dwellings, may be, and often is, a source of vast injury to the pubhc

--health. Opinions may vary as to the precise mode in which that influence

is exercised whether by the evolution of deleterious gases, by the pollution

of water, by the development of those minute organisms which are now very
generally considered to be the media of infection, or in all of these ways

conjointly ; but there is no longer any doubt or difference of opinion as to

ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OP SEWAGE.  315

 the general truth that, in regard to the mode of dealing with excretal refuse,
 the sanitary point of view is far more important than any other. If, then,
the weightiest question to be solved by a municipal body be, how best to
 preserve the health and life of the population committed to its charge, it is
 evident that one of the fii'st duties of such a body is that of providing for the
disposal of excretal refuse in a suitable manner. The recognition of this
sanitary axiom has been so imperatively enforced during the present century
by the frequent prevalence of epidemic diseases, such as cholera and fever,
that it may perhaps now be regarded as unquestionable, except where igno-
rance overcomes intelligence, and where mistaken notions of economy prevail.

    Under this aspect the subject has lately attracted very general attention,
not only in this country but also in most civilized countries abroad. It will
therefore be desirable to recite briefly the circumstances under which excretal

refuse may become a source of injury to health, and to trace the course events

have taken in regard to this subject since public attention was first directed
to the sanitary condition of towns, and since measures have been adopted
with a view to its amelioration.

    Besides the inconvenience and ofiensive character of the system of collecting
excretal refuse in pits or vaults near dwellings, the evils consequent on that
plan arose chiefly from the impregnation of the surrounding soil with decom-
posing material, and sometimes also from the pollution of water used for
domestic purposes. The pits or reservoirs were in some cases provided with
overflow channels or with drains, by which the liquid contents were discharged

into a neighbouring watercourse or into a sewer ; but in many cases that was
unnecessary, where the soil was of a sufficiently porous nature to admit of the
continuous free escape of liquid from the pits. By this natural drainage,

according to the nature of the soil, the liquid portions of the excreta would
permeate the soil and gain access to the wells, which were, as a very general
custom, placed close to the pits where excreta were collected. Moreover this

foul drainage would be augmented in many cases by the access of surface-

water to the pits, especially during wet weather.

   These evils were often much aggravated by the absence of any systematic

drainage or sewerage of towns sufficient for the removal of subsoil water,
which became stagnant and putrefied beneath the dwellings. Even where
imderground sewers existed they appear to have been intended only for the
removal of surface-water ; the connexion of house-drains with these sewers
was prohibited, and it was penal to discharge or throw any excretal or other

oflfensive refuse into rivers.

   At that time the water-closets (introduced by Bramah in 1793) were very
rarely in use ; they had been adopted only in the better class of houses in
towns, and then they were used in conjimction with underground vaults for
receiving the material discharged from them. Their subsequent more general
adoption, and the concurrent acquisition of a better and more copious water-
supply, were no doubt largely conducive to domestic comfort and convenience
but, in regard to the condition of towns, these changes were attended with
a decided aggravation of the evils arising from the use of vaults or pits as
receptacles of excreta ; for the drainage or overflow from these pits became
continuous on account of the use of water in the closets, and it was no longer
dependent on the occasional access of rain. Under these circumstances the
pits or vaults became cesspools *, constantly charged with liquid, and in
most cases they had no outlet into the sewers. Even so late as 1844 the Health

of Towns' Commissioners state, in their first Report, that " in some of the
larger and most crowded towns all entrance into the sewers by house-drains
or drains from water-closets or cesspools is prohibited under a penalty;"
while in other i^laces, including part of the metropolis, the entrance of house-
drains was deemed " the concession of a privilege subjected to regulations
and separate proceedings with attendant expenses," tending either to restrict
the use of sewers for the purpose of removing excretal refuse and the drain-
age from pits containing it, or to confine the advantages of this plan to

the wealthy.

   The removal of the domestic nuisance and inconvenience attending the use
of privies and pits for collecting the refuse, by the introduction of water-
closets, gave rise in this way to the creation of a toiim nuisance ; the old town
sewers or drains proved inadequate to the duty thrown upon them ; for in
some instances an improved water-supply was taken into a town without
any means being provided for taking it out again : the pent-up overflow
from cesspools, connected with water-closets, satm'ated the subsoil, the water
of wells became permanently polluted, foetid water rose in the cellars of
houses, rendering the air impure by its exhalations, sickness followed, and
eventually there arose a loud outcry against the cesspool system as an into-
lerable nuisance, affecting not merely individual houses but the town generally.

   The plan proposed as a remedy for this evil was the general adoption
of water-closets, combined with a system of thorough town sewerage, the
connexion of house-drains with the sewers being made compulsory on the
owners of houses under certain conditions. By this means the necessity for
allowing excretal refuse to accumulate at all near dwellings or within towns
was to be done away with ; this refuse was to be ;;t oace removed from dwell-
ings into the sewers by a copious use of water, and swept rapidly through them
out of the town with the waste water from houses and the surface-drainage.

   By this plan the whole of the water entering a town is eventually
polluted either by use or by admixture, and then constitutes what is now
commonly termed town-sewage, the expeditious removal of which from the

vicinity of towns is indispensable for the health of the neighboiu-hood.

   This system, known as the water-carriage system, has been largely

adopted in this country, and, as a consequence, both the drainage of towns

and the removal of the excretal refuse have been in many cases effected by

the same means. The utilization of this town-sewage as manure, by irri-
gating land, was contemplated at the outset, but it was not enforced, and it
has been carried out only in a few cases, the sewage as a rule being dis-
charged from the sewers into any adjoining river or into the sea, this being
permitted so long as it does not create a 'nuisance. Individuals or towns
injured by the discharge of sewage in this way were left to obtain what
redress they could by legal means. The adoption of this system is well
known to have given rise to much litigation, and many towns where it has
been adopted have been placed in a very difficult position in consequence of
injunctions by the Court of Chancery prohibiting the discharge of their
sewage into watercourses.

    Moreover the adoption of the water-closet and sewerage system of dealing
with excretal refuse has been followed by a greatly augmented pollution of

rivers, which is now acknowledged to have become an evil of national
importance, and is still a subject of official inquiry. At this point, when the

measures adopted for removing successively the domestic nuisance and the
town nuisance, arising from the disposal of excretal refuse, have given rise to
a national nuisance, it has become a very serious matter to determine what
--

is to be done with the sewage of towns. The importance of this question
is shown by the fact that, besides engaging the attention of the late General
Board of Health, besides being frequentlj' discussed in Parliament and by
the various local authorities throughout the kingdom, it has within the last
thirteen years given rise to the appointment of three Eoyal Commissions
charged with the duties of investigating the subject and of suggesting

remedial measures, viz. :

   I. The Sewage Commission, dated 5th January 1857, " to inquire into the
best mode of distributing the sewage of towns and applying it to beneficial
and profitable uses," from which three reports have issued, bearing date
March 1858, August 1861, and March 1865. The conclusions the Com-
missioners arrived at were to the eflfect that the direct application of sewage
to land favourably situated, if judiciously carried out and confined to a
suitable area exclusively grass, is profitable to persons so employing it ; that
where the conditions are unfavourable, a small payment on the part of the
local authorities will restore the balance ; that this method of sewage appli-
cation, conducted with moderate care, is not productive of nuisance or injury

to health.

   That methods of precipitation are satisfactory merely as a means of

mitigating a nuisance.

   That the only radical way of restoring the rivers to their original purity is

to prevent the discharge of foul matters into them, and especially the dis-
charge of sewage and other refuse of large towns.

   That the right way to dispose of town sewage is to apply it continuously

to land, and that it is only by such application that the pollution of rivers
can be avoided.

   That the magnitude of a town presents no real difficulty to the effectual

treatment of its sewage, provided it be considered as a collection of smaller

towns.

   II. The Elvers' Commission, dated 18th May 1865, "to inquire how far

the present use of rivers for carrying off the sewage of towns, populous

places, &c. can be prevented without risk to the public health, and how far

such sewage &c. can be utilized," from which three reports have already

issued, bearing date March 1866, May 1867, and August 1867, and further

reports are expected.

   And III. The Eoyal Sanitary Commission, dated November 1868, "to in-

quire into and report on the operations of the sanitary laws for towns, villages,
and rural districts in Great Britain and Ireland, so far as these laws apply
to sewerage, drainage, water-supply, removal of refuse, prevention of over-
crowding, and other conditions conducive to the public health." This latter

Commission is now engaged in its first proceedings, which are limited to the

consolidation and improvement of existing laws, and the establishment of a
better recognized central control. It is expected that a preliminary report
from this Commission will shortly appear.

   The object of your Committee has been understood by its Members as that

of supplementing the above-mentioned public inquiries, with special informa-
tion, as to the local circumstances and practical experience of various towns
throughout the kingdom, and with other positive data relating to the subject,
such as the Eoyal Sewage Commission have pointed out as requisite to be

ascertained.

   Tour Committee, in entering on its duties, came to the conclusion that
since town sewage, as it is now most commonly known in this countr)^ is a
source of nuisance, inconvenience, and injury to health, chiefly by reason of
                 --;

its containing the excretal refuse of the population, it was desirable the term
sewage should not be restricted to the liquid discharged from sewers in places
where there is a thorough system of sewerage combined with water-closets
and a copious supply of water, or, in other words, where the water-carriage
system of disposing of excretal refuse has been adopted, but that it should,
for the purposes of this inquiry, be understood as comprising excretal refuse
in any state. This extended appHcation of the teim sewage seemed to be

the more desirable, since there are many towns and places that are at present

 debarred from adopting any measures for dealing with their excretal refuse
by doubts entertained as to the sanitary efficacy of such a system as that just
 mentioned, and by a knowledge of the difficulties attending the disposal of
 the sewage produced under that system. In order to ensure an explicit
understanding on this point in aU correspondence and communications, the
following resolution was passed at a meeting of your Committee on the 5th

of January, 1869, viz. :

    " That the Committee do interpret the word ' sewage ' in the instructions
of the Association as meaning any refuse, from human habitations, that may
affect the public health ;" and this interpretation of the term was specified in
aU applications for information.

    Bearing in mind the circumstance, already referred to in the introductory
remarks, that formerly town-sewers were essentially drains, the objects of
which were simply and exclusively the removal of surface- and slop-water
 by the most direct course to the nearest stream, as well as the fact that such
 sewers, originally intended only for drainage, have in various ways come to
be confounded with and used as sewers for removing excretal refuse as well
 as the surface and subsoil water, it was, for these reasons, considered to be
 especially important to make a marked distinction between drainage and
sewerage, and, with that object, to designate the removal of surface and sub-
 soU water from land by permeable channels " drainage by drains," and the
 removal of excretal or other refuse from dwellings, factories, streets, &c., by
water throi^gh impervious conduits, " sewerage by sewers." According to

 this distinction, a drain should be understood as a permeable channel adapted
 throughout its entire length to remove water from the soil surrounding it
 while a sewer should be understood as a channel sufficiently impermeable to be

 adapted for conveying away house refuse without allowing either the refuse

 to escape tlirough its sides or water to penetrate from without.

    One of the first steps taken by the Committee was to apply to Her

Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department for his assistance in ob-

 taining information from foreign countries respecting the practices prevailing
 abroad for disposing of the refuse of towns, villages, public institutions, facto-
 ries, dwellings, &c., and having reference to the sanitary condition of the dis-
 tricts in which they are situated, the state of rivers, or the support and in-
 crease of the produce of the soil ; to this application Mr. Secretary Bruce has
 given effect by transmitting from time to time very valuable information,

 received from the following countries.

It appears from these documents that in most cases (both in town and

country places) the use of privies is very general, water-closets being rare

even in large towns, and that the usual method of dealing with human

excreta is to allow them to collect in pits (Abtrittsgruben, fosses), which are

sometimes drained, either naturally by the permeable character of the soU, or

artificially, so that most or all of the liquid portion of the contents of the pits

flows away or infiltrates the surrounding soil. Frequently privies are built

over rivers, with the object of getting rid of the excreta at once; and at

some places methods still more objectionable are adopted, many houses are

without either water-closets or privies, the common custom being to use

nightstools, which are emptied into pits near the house ; thus, for instance, in

Berlin, with a population under 600,000, there are said to be no less than

50,000 nightstools in daily use.

Only in some few foreign towns is there any system of sewerage for the

removal of excreta by means of water ; this is the case in Hamburg, Paris,

Brussels, Hanover, Washington, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and some other

American towns to a greater or less extent. In some other towns modified

arrangements of the privy and pit system have been to some extent adopted.

These consist in substituting for the ordinary pit either a fixed or a portable re-

servoir for receiving the excreta. These reservoirs are sometimes constructed

with a drain by which the overflow or the liquid contents escape, and some-

times they are both water- and air-tight, the discharge of the liquid contents

into the sewers being prohibited. In some cases such reservoirs are con-

structed so as to receive only the excreta, and sometimes so as to separate the

solid and liquid excreta                                                                                                 but  they are also used  in  combination with water-
                                                                                                                      ;

closets, and sometimes they receive rain-water from the house-roofs &c. as

well.

The contents of the fixed reservoirs are removed periodically in several

different ways, and according to divers local regulations. Sometimes the

contents are simply dipped out, and sometimes they are removed either by
pumping into closed tank-carts with lift-pumps, or by means of a vacuum

previously produced in the tank-cart. In some few cases the time that may

elapse between the removal of the contents of these reservoirs is fixed by the
local authorities. The portable reservoirs are from time to time removed

and replaced by empty reservoirs, then carried outside the town, and their

contents used as manure in some way. Both the fixed and portable re-

servoirs are frequently ventilated by means of shafts rising above the house-
tops. Fixed reservoirs are used in Carlsruhe, Ostend, Antwerp, Strasburg,
Berlin, Dresden.

     Portable reservoirs are used in Gratz, Dresden,L eipzig, Strasburg, Berlin,
Paris. Generally the contents of pits and of fixed or portable reservoirs are
used as manure. In some cases each householder pays for the removal of
excretal refuse, in others the contents of pits and reservoirs are sold. At
some places the town authorities pay for the removal of the refuse and
street-sweepings. Thus in Carlsruhe, a town with about 25,000 inhabitants
and 1400 houses, about ,£500 a year is paid to the contractor for this service,
and the contractor sells the manure.

    Sometimes a town derives some return from the excretal and other refuse
removed and used as manure. In the town of Groningen the yearly profit
amounts to about ^1600, in Antwerp it is ^2700, at Ostend =£700. In Stras-
burg the cost of removal is only just covered by the sale of the manure. The

sale of the refuse from the barracks at Carlsruhe, where 2800 men were

quartered, has realized a'profit of ,£300 a year, and the attendant expenses
amounted to about =£40 a year.

    According to experience in the neighbourhood of Berne, Basle, Munich,
Zurich, Ghent, and other towns where excretal refuse is removed and used
as manure, there is always a profit realized after payment of the cost of
removal and transport ; and it appears to be considered probable that the
expense attending this system would be reduced by the adoption of portable
reservoirs. In some other towns the cost of removal and transport exceeds
the return ; thus, in Stockholm, with a population of about 150,000, the
expenditure amounts to £35,000 a year, and the income derived from the sale
of the refuse as manure is £33,000 a year.

   In Hamburg there is an extensive system of sewerage, and in a large part

of the town the excreta are removed by water-carriage through sewers. In
Brussels, Paris, Lausanne, and Lugano the water-carriage system is also
more or less adopted in some form adapted to local conditions. However,
in the two latter towns water-closets are but rarely used, and in Basle likewise
the privies are situated so as to discharge into the Ehine, or into one of its

tributaries. In the case of Hamburg the water of the Elbe is stated to be
much polluted by the discharge of sewage, but without any apparent serious

influence on health. However, statistics furnished by the Secretary to the

Hamburg Board of Health show that the rate of mortality has kept pace with

the increase of population. In 1840, before the construction of the sewerage,
the population was 137,000, with a mortality of 28 per thousand. In 1848
the population was 148,000, with a mortality of 22 per thousand ; in 1859
the population was 174,000, with a mortality of 26 per thousand ; and in
1866 the population was 195,000, with a mortality of 28 per thousand.

   The general purport of the communications received from foreign countries
is to show that the question as to the means by which excretal refuse may be
disposed of and removed from dwellings, villages, and towns, so as to prevent

nuisance or evil consequences as regards the sanitary condition of the locality,

is, at least, quite as much an open and disputed question as it is in this

country. In these documents there is abundant evidence that, wherever the
subject has been considered, there is a strong, though vague sense of the
injury to health resulting from the accumulation of excretal materials in pits
&c. within populous districts, by the impregnation of the soil, by the pol-
lution of rivers and well-water with drainage from such accumulations, or
from the discharge of excretal materials into watercourses directly or indi-

rectly ; and it appears to be generally admitted that these are serious evils
that require to be remedied.

    Besides these views as to the sanitary aspect of the subject, there is stiU

more decisive evidence of the conviction that a vast quantity of material is

now wasted which might be of great service in agriculture for sustaining and

augmenting the fertihty of cultivated land. There is, however, no instance
in which decisive conclusions have been arrived at as to the best mode of
dealing with town-refuse so as to secure a satisfactory state of public health,
and at the same time admit of the agricultural value of that refuse being
realized without concurrent disadvantages. It does not appear that any par-
ticular improved system of dealing with house-refuse has been generally
adopted as a substitute for the old practice of collecting such refuse in pits
with periodical removal of the contents ; neither is there any case where an
attempted improvement has been long enough practised to furnish satisfactory
evidence as to the efficacy of the means adopted, and their influence on public

health. In both these respects it may safely be said that foreign towns are,

as a rule, far behind some towns in this country.
   The method of removing excretal refuse by pumping it into carts and carry-

ing it out of the town to the neighbouring land, has in some instances been
continued with satisfaction, while in other instances it has been abandoned

after trial.

   The plans of collecting and removing excretal refuse in portable closed
reservoirs has been largely adopted in France, Saxony, Switzerland, and other
countries ; but in no case is any specific information given as to the extent to
which the liquid portion escapes, spontaneously or by drainage, to pollute the
adjoining soil and watercourses, or how far the portion of the refuse that
remains represents the original value of the excreta for agriculture. In some
towns it is evident that only the solid excreta are used as manure ; thus in
Zurich there is a system of sewerage which carries off both the rain-water
and liqiiid drainage from gutters, houses, and reservoirs for collecting excreta.
Probably in most cases, where cesspools or fixed and portable reservoirs are
in use, the greater part of the liquid excreta drains away.

    In some towns, as in Berlin for instance, the use of water as a means of
transporting the refuse has been proposed, and it is stiU under consideration.
Some of the scientific authorities deputed to inquire into the subject have,
however, recommended that any general system of sewerage, based on that

principle, should not be adopted, because of the increased difficulty it gives
rise to in the realization of the value of the excreta as manure, and because
of the anticipated prejudicial influences on the air of the district if the
sewage were applied to land, and upon the water of rivers if the liquid

refuse were mixed with it.
    There does not appear to be, in any country, general or systematic legisla-

tion in reference to sanitary matters. Almost everywhere the regulations
with that object are in the hands of the police or other local authorities ; and
 though the provisions relating to removal of refuse, cleaning of streets, &c.
 are often very minute and stringent, they are seldom or ever of such a
nature as to deal effectually with those tendencies to unhealthiness which
 result from accumulation of excretal and other refuse material, especially in
 large towns or densely populated districts.

    As to the precise conditions that affect the public health, the connexion
between the sanitary state of towns and the drainage, water-supply, mode of
 disposing of excretal refuse, &c., there appears to be, even more than in this
 country, an absence of definite knowledge or of demonstrative evidence in

favour of any particular view, though at the same time there is everywhere

--in civilized countries an earnest consideration of these subjects in all their

bearings sanitary, municipal, and agricultural.

While this information was being collected from foreign countries, the

Committee prepared a series of questions with the object of eliciting infor-

mation as to the several cities, towns, and rural districts throughout the
United Kingdom, so far as the means at its disposal would permit. These

questions were sent to 340 local sanitary and sewer authorities, representing

a population of about 10 millions. Up to the present time replies have been

received from 107 places having an aggregate population of more than 4

millions.

    It will be evident that, according to local conditions, there will be great dif-                                                                       I
ferences in the nature of the liquid sewage of different places, and that even the

contents of pits, cesspools, &c. will vary, according as the soil is readily or

slightly permeable. The amount of the water-supply and the admission or ex-
clusion of surface-water from the sewers will also be of influence in this way.

  --Total Quantity and Amount of Liquid Sewage. Among the 96 places

where there is a system of sewerage, either general or partial, combined

with water-closets and a copious supply of water, the minimum daily quan-

tity of liquid sewage discharged varies from 20,000 gallons as at Alton, to
17 million gallons as at Birmingham, and 130 million gallons as at Liverpool.

   The storm-discharge at places where the surface-water is admitted to the
sewers varies from one and a half to twenty times as much as the discharge
during dry weather, and at places where the surface-water is wholly or par-
tially excluded it varies from one and one-tenth to seven times as much as

the dry-weather discharge.
   The average amount of liquid sewage per head of the population in places

where the surface-water is admitted to the sewers varies from 10 to upwards
of 100 gallons, and at places where the surface-water is excluded it varies

--from 6 to 100.
   Treatment of Liquid Sewage. At 15 of the places which are sewered
wholly or partially, the liquid sewage is subjected to treatment either by
allowing it to remain for a time in settling-tanks, from which the deposit is
occasionally removed, as at Burton-on-Treut, Birmingham, Epsom, Fareham,
and Audover, or by filtering, as at Uxbridge and Eahng.

   In eight instances deodorizing materials are added to the sewage. Lime and
carbolic acid are used at Carlisle and Harrow, lime alone is used at Leicester,
lime and chloride of lime at Luton, perchloride of iron at Cheltenham, perchlo-

ride of iron and Hme at Northampton, ferruginous clay treated with sulphuric

acid at Stroud, and at Leamington the lime treatment has lately been super-

seded by the method proposed by Messrs. Sillar and Wigner. By this treatment

the sewage is clarified, and a deposit is separated which is sold as manure.
    In regard to the effects thus produced, it is stated that at Leicester the

sewage runs off as pure as ordinary rain-water ; at Ealing it is said to be free
from smell, colourless, and harmless to vegetable or animal life ; at Stroud

and Luton the effect is stated to be satisfactory. At Harrow the nuisance is
said to be somewhat mitigated, and at Abergavenny the stench is said to
be abated by the treatment of the sewage. At Bury St. Edmunds upward
filtration through charcoal and gypsum has been abandoned as too costly and
in favour of irrigation. At Banbuiy treatment of the sewage has failed, and
irrigation is now resorted to. At Hereford, where it was proposed to be

adopted in the Parliamentary plans, it has not been tried, on the score of ex-
pense. At Tonbridge it is about to be tried ; and at Hastings and Cambridge

experiments are being made.

        ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.                                                                          327

   The cost of treatment amounts to .£1200 a year at Leicester for a popula-
tion of 89,000 discharging into the sewers. At Ealing, with a population of
7500, the annual cost is =£300, and the cost of the jilant for the purpose was
^3000. At Luton, with a population of 18,000, the annual cost is .£500 ; at
Cheltenham, with a population of 36,000, it is ^350 ; at TJxbridge, with
7000 population, it is £200 ; and at iUton, with 3300 population, it is £46.

   The solid deposit obtained by treating liquid sewage is sold at prices
varying from 6d. to 2s. 6J. per ton. At Leicester as much as 5000 tons is
produced. At Luton the deposit is mixed with night-soU, at Banbury with
street-sweepings, and at Stroud it is made the basis of a manure that is said
to be sold at £7 10s. per ton.

    Application of Liquid Sewage for Irrigation.--In only 15 places out of the
96 where the water-carriage system of removing excretal refuse is adopted,

either generally or partially, is the sewage applied for irrigating land. Of
these places 8 are completely sewered ; in 11 of them water-closets are

   The following towns are about to apply their sewage for irrigation, or

they contemplate doing so :

                Towns.
328 REPORT--1869.

    At Tonbridge it is stated that the application of the sewage for irrigating
land would be almost impossible, and the local authorities believe aU trials
that have been made to apply sewage in this way are failures and a source of
dissatisfaction on account of nuisance and expense. Lincoln is also said not
to admit of this application of sewage. At Cambridge the subject is under

consideration.

    Comparing the extent of land ii-rigated and the population discharging
into the sewers at the places above named, it appears that in the case of Bir-
mingham there is only -4 of an acre per 1000 of population ; at Edinburgh
there is 1'7 acre per 1000 ; at Carlisle, Bedford, and Chorley there is from 3
to 3-5 acres ; at Harrow, Reigate, and Chelmsford there is from 5 to 6-6
acres ; at Epsom, llugby, and Malvern from 7"5 to 10 acres ; at Tunbridge
WeUs, Banbury, and Norwich from 10 to 12 acres per 1000.

    There does not appear to be any provision in most cases for additional
land for irrigation except at Carlisle and Norwich. At Chelmsford there is

some, but it is too high to be reached ; and at Tunbridge WeUs the purchase

of additional land is contemplated.

    At CarHsle, Reigate, Epsom, Inverness, and Tenterden the land selected
for irrigation is situated within the district, under control of the local sewer
authorities, at a distance of from one-fifth of a mile to half a mile from the
centre of the town, and within a quarter of a mile of the outskirts. At
Edinburgh, Bedford, Rugby, Chelmsford, Harrow, Skipton, Norwich, Perth,
and Bury St. Edmunds, it is outside the district, at a distance of from half a
mile (Perth) to 3 miles (Norwich) from the centre of the town, and from half
a mile (Bury St. Edmunds, Harrow, Chelmsford, Bedford) to Ij mile (Norwich)
beyond the outskirts ; at Birmingham, Chorley, Braintree, Banbury, and
Malvern the land is partly within and partly outside the district under the
sewer authorities.

   The distance of the irrigated land from the lowest sewer-outlet of the town
varies from 100 yards to ujjwards of a mile. In some cases it has been pur-
chased, as at Harrow, Reigate, and Tunbridge Wells ; but in most cases it
has been leased. Sometimes it is occupied by the sewer authorities, some-
times let to a farmer, as shown in the accompanying Table, which shows also
the cost of delivery to the land by gravitation or pumping, and other details.

   At most places the application of the sewage to land has been found to
exercise a most beneficial influence on the condition of the streams and
rivers receiving the drainage of the district. At Epsom there was some
damage done to the Hog's Mill River, but no complaint is now made. Even
where only the solid portion of the sewage is separated by filtration or preci-
pitation, the state of rivers receiving the discharge is to some extent improved.
At Northampton an application for an injunction has been made by a mUler

resident on the stream.

   Generally speaking no objections appear to have been made to the applica-
tion of sewage for irrigation ; and where such objections have been urged, on
the ground that the application was offensive and injurious, they do not
appear to have been supported by medical authority, and in several instances

they have ceased.

   As regards the sanitary condition of these districts, it appears that in most
cases the application of sewage for irrigation has not been attended with any
apparent change ; but there is said to be a marked improvement at Braintree.

    It is to be understood that, in all cases, the data given in this Report and re-
lating to this country, have been obtained from the local sewer authorities, in
reply to letters of inquiry sent by the Committee, and that since there has

not yet been any opportunity for examining in detail the circumstances of any

particular locality, it would be premature at present to venture on any con-

clusions as to the numerous questions arising in reference to the treatment and

utilization of sewage, or even to trust implicitly to the figures (Src. given. Even on

the assumption that the information furnished to the Committee does fairly re-

present the whole of the circumstances to be considered, that information pre-

sents so much variation and even discrepancy in several important details, that

it seems indispensable there should be, in many instances, a miniite investiga-

tion upon the spot, which the Committee has not yet had the power to make.

Although the Committee regards the present Keport as dealing only par-

tially with the subject of sewage, and as being in fact only a preliminary step

towards the work required to be done, it is considered that there are two

points (viz. the cost of various methods of dealing with excretal refuse, and

their influence on the sanitary condition of towns) which must be referred to

here, so far as the data obtained -^dll permit.

The removal of the contents of pits and cesspools by cartage appears to be

in some few instances conducted with some profit ; more frequently, how-

ever, the cost is at least equal to the return obtained, and very often it is a

source of loss. In regard to this point there is a marked difference between the

results obtained in this country and those obtained on the Continent, where

the removal of the contents of the pits is frequently profitable, either to indivi-

duals or to towns. The treatment of liquid sewage does not appear to have

been advantageous in any instance, except in lessening the nuisance that would

otherwise be caused by the discharge of sewage into rivers, and in most in-

stances it has been a source of loss to the towns where it is practised.

The cost of the application of sewage for irrigatirg land appears to be

dependent on a number of local coiiditions, and consequently to V9ry consider-

ably. It would seem, from the data obtained, that in many instances the outlay

requisite for this purpose woidd exceed what a farmer coidd be expected to

incur, and that, in sucli cases at least, it would be proper to regard this outlay

as coming under two distinct heads, viz. that which a town may reasonably be

expected to bear for the mere object of getting rid of its refuse, and that which

landowners or farmers may be able to incur for the improvement of their land.

It is probable that, when viewed in this light, the application of liquid sewage

to land would become a source of revenue to towns only under specially

favourable circumstances                                                                                                                               and tliat, in opposition to the opinions wliich have
                                                                                                                                                    ;

been somewhat hastily formed in certain cases, it wiU more frequently entail

some amount of expenditure on the towns themselves. At the same time the

benefit to land, and the improvement in the condition of rivers to be realized

by the mode of dealing with liquid sewage, can scarcely be matter of doubt or

uncertainty any longer.

In regard to the sanitary aspect of the subject, it may be regarded as

beyond question that the practice of allowing excretal refuse to accumulate

and remain neglected for a long time near dweUings, in pits, middens, cess-

pools, or otherwise, is almost invariably accompanied by prejudicial efiects on

the sanitary condition of the places where it is adopted, either by the im-

pregnation of the soil with decaying material, by the pollution of water, or

by noxious exhalations.

But even in some places where the water-supply has been improved, where a

system of sewerage has been adopted, and other measures have been taken

with the object of getting rid of excretal refuse, the fact that the rate of

mortality has not been sensibly, if at aU diminished, appears to point to some

circumstance, as yet insufficiently guarded against, which still exercises a pre-

judicial influence. The imperfect or defective nature of the sewerage may, by
 allowing- infiltration of sewage into the soil and its passage to the foundations
of houses, in some cases be the cause to which this result is referable._ But
one part of the sewerage system which most urgently demands attention at

the present time is the ventilation. Gases of a poisonous or deleterious nature
are freely given off from liquid sewage in its passage along the sewers, or

from deposits collecting in them and in the house-drains. These gases na-
turally ascend the sewers, and find egress, either into the streets of a town or
into the dwellings, by means of the house-draias and otherwise. The means

adoi^ted for getting rid of these gases, without injury to the sanitary state

of a town or of the houses in it, are rarely of such a kind as to be effective ;
and the returns already obtained in reference to this matter sufficiently show
that attention has not been directed to it in a degree commensurate with its

importance.

    On these grounds the Committee considers that it would be in the highest

degree desirable to institute an inquiry into the nature of the gaseous ema-

nations from sewers in various places, that being one of the points now most

important in connexion with the system of disposing of excretal refuse which
is rapidly being adopted throughout this country. In reference to the appH-
 cation of liquid sewage to laud, it is also considered that, in addition to va-
 rious other points relating to the application and purification of sewage-water
by ii-rigatiou, it would be very serviceable to make some inquiry into the
 nature of the sewage discharged in various places, so as to ascertain the dif-
ferences that exist in Hquid sewage so far as its value as manure is con-
 cerned, and at the same time to endeavour to obtain more deiiuite information
 as to the cost of removing night-soil, and as to its agricultural value as esta-
 blished by practice.

 Supplement to the Second Report of the Committee on the Condensation
                and Analysis of Tables of Steamship Performance.

The Committee have to report that the sum of £30 granted to them has

 been wholly expended in the payment of Mr. Quant, their calculator, as
 authorized hi the resolution by which they were appointed. The calculator's
 time was employed partly in revising the printed Tables, which appeared in
 the volume of Eeports for 1868, and partly in making an additional analyzed
 Table. The last-mentioned Table in MS. was delivered to the Secretary
 of the British Association early in the present year, and is annexed hereto.
 The Committee beg leave to represent that it is desirable that they should be
 reappointed, for the purpose of superintending the printing of that Table ; but
 that no further grant of money will be required. They have again to express
 their satisfaction with the manner in Avhich Mr. Quant performed his duties.

            Revised Ancdysis, according to the method of Mr. Scott Russell.

     In the Table of analyzation according to Mr. Scott EusscU's method, as
 originally computed, the length of forcbody Avas assumed at -55 of the length
 of the ship, which in practice is generally the place of the midship section.

 This length of bow belongs to the displacement of the ship, but not to the

 speed. Therefore in calculating the resistance there are introduced a coeffi-

 cient of diminished resistance belonging to one bow and a speed belonging to

 another bow, or, in other words, two ships have been used.
                                                                         --

                                                                             ON STEAMSHIP PERFORMANCE.                   331

   In the following Table this has been rectified by taking a length of bow

belonging to the speed and also to the displacement. For example, the speed

of a ship is 11 -22 knots, or 18-96 feet per second ; to this belongs a bow of
70 feet, and an afterbody of 47 feet ; the ship is 336 feet long, hence there
remains for middlebody 219 feet. IS'ow the question arises, what is the

corresponding area of midship section ? because if the area of midship section
as given in the Tables were used, it would result in too large a displacement
with the above dimensions of fore, after, and middlebody. Eor this piirpose

we have as follows :

+ +Area of midship section X{-ol+-5l' 1" -19G35B)='D x35.

Substituting 7=70, ?'=47, l"=219, B=40-92, and D=3979, the result is

an area of midship section=487'7 square feet. By the Tables it is given as

Q'653; and the calculated section is therefore 165-6                                                    too small, or the

vessel under the above dimensions sits lighter on the water. It is the lighter

midship section which has been used in the following Table. To find the

corresponding draught, taking the sides of the ship at the midship section as

nearly vertical, the difference is divided by the beam of the ship and the

quotient subtracted from the given draught. This results in a lighter

--draught of 14-3 feet instead of 18-35 as given by the Table a difference

of 4-04 feet. The difference is not always so large ; in some vessels it does
not amount to a foot.

Twice this difference in draught has been deducted from the actual girth

of the midship section in order to find a girth suited for cplculating the

wetted surface ; in the example this gives G=54-72 instead of 62-8.

   The coefficient of diminished resistance has been taken to belong to the
bow as assumed above, and has been calculated by taking the square of the

sine of the angle formed by half the beam and the length.

The skin has been calculated by the following formiila,

                                                                 + +(·58G +·84c?)(? r) l"G= skin or wetted surface,

in which formula the lighter girth at the midship section and the lighter

draught must be substituted.

   The calculations of resistance due to ship's way, skin, Sec. have been made
in the manner explained in the second Keport. It may happen that the length
of bow belonging to speed is greater than the ship itself as given in the Tables,

as in the case of the ' Midge ' aud ' Penelope.' In such cases an afterbody

is added to the forcbody belonging to that speed, and with the two lengths
and the given displacement the area of midship section, draught, and girth

have been calculated.

   It will be seen that in the following revised Table most of the negative
quantities which appeared in the former Table have disappeared. The quan-

tities in the following Table belong to ships of the same displacement, same
speed, same length, same beam, and same indicated horse-power with the

actual ships                                                     whilst  those  in  the  former  Table belong to ships of the same
                                                              ;

displacement, same length, same breadth, same draught, and same indicated

power, but not the same speed, although that speed was introduced in the

calculations resulting for the most part in the negative quantities as found

for slip or engines.

334 REPORT--1869.

     Report on Recent Progress in Elliptic and Hijperelliptic Functions.

                         By W. H. L. Russell, F.R.S.

I SHALL never forget tlie evening when I first became acquainted -with Mr.

Ellis's report on the present state of Analysis published by this Association.
I felt like a traveller who, on entering an unknown country through dark
and narrow paths, suddenly arrives at an eminence from which he sees the

whole region spread out like a map before him, and perceives at a glance the

roads leading to the principal cities, and the most desirable mansions. I fol-

lowed this guidance in my reading, and, as I proceeded, became anxious to

attempt for others what Mr. Ellis had effected for me, and in consequence to
imdertake the present Report.

   I shall keep steadily in view three main objects. In the first place, I shall
endeavour to prove theorems enunciated by their authors without demonstra-

tion. Secondly, to explain passages which may present difficulties, and to give
such directions as may enable the reader to arrive with the least difficulty at

the most important parts of the different memoirs which will come under re-
view. And, thirdly, to give such a connected view of the whole, as will

enable anyone entering on the studjr of our present subject to know before-

hand the nature of the results which have been obtained.
   Elliptic functions will first be considered ; and I shall divide the subject

into four parts.

   (1) I shall consider recent researches in this branch which do not involve

the idea of periodicity.

   (2) Eeccnt investigations relative to function 0, and its allied series.
   (3) Modular equations, and some other researches of a similar description.
   (4) Some of the most important geometrical and physical applications of

eUiptic functions.

                                                    Part I.

 --Section 1. It will be proper to commence by giving a list of the principal

algebraical integrals which can be reduced to elliptic functions. They are
taken from Schellbach's ' Lehre von den EUiptischen Integralen,' and from a
paper by Eothig in the fifty-sixth volume of Crelle's Journal. Along with

the integrals I shall indicate the transformations necessary for their re-
duction.

--336 REPORT 1869,

 --Section 2. In the eighth volume of the ' Cambridge and Dublin ATathema-

tical Journal ' there is a paper by Mr. F. JS^ewman " On the Third Elliptic
Integral.'' The i^rincipal object of this paper is to apply Lagrange's trans-
formation to this integral so as to obtain available results. The interest and

difficulty attaching to this are great, and I think it well, therefore, to pre-
sent Mr. j^ewmau's leading theorem to the reader in a form which he will

find it easy to follow.

    Let

         = = V --V AAi i --c^' sin- d^,
                                           1 c^ sin= d,

Then, following the usual scale of Lagrange, if

         a =sine cos                                             1-e'

From this we obtain

l±^P(e,n,0)-LjL'P(c,-m,0) = -^tan-'(VniSin0O; · (5)

therefore we have from (-1) and (5), remembering (2),

              -fitan-^CV nosing,);

whence it is easy to see that if d.^ and n.^ &c. are formed from 0^ and n^ as 0j and
«j were formed from and n, we have

   This very beautiful theorem applies to the third elliptic integral with cir-

cular parameters ; but it is obvious that it may be easily extended to loga-
rithmic parameters, as has been done by Mr. Newman. In a subsequent
part of his paper, Mr. Newman points out the connexion between his own

--researches and some of Jacobi's discoveries.
   Section 3. In the 36th volume of Crclle*s Journal there is a Memoir by

the late Professor Plana, of Turin, on the reduction of 1--7=, to elliptic

functions, where

   It would be impossible to give an analysis of this memoir without repro-
ducing it, which is the less necessary as so much has been written on this
subject. I shall therefore confine myself to directing the reader's attention

to a particular portion of it.

   At the beginning of the ninth section there is a method for reducing the
sums of two elliptic functions of the form

and then finding two suitable values for ^. The section to which I refer

is almost detached from the rest of the memoir, and may be read without

diificulty. There is another paper by Pdchelot on this subject in the Sith

   Section 4. Of late the theory of continued fractions has received a very

Awide extension.  very beautiful example of this will be found in the 56tli

volume of Crelle's Journal, in which Laplace's coefficients are applied to the

expansion of functions in continued fractions. It is not, therefore, surprising

that the exi^ansion of elliptic functions in this manner should have been the

subject of several successful eflTorts. In the 39th volume of CreUe's Journal

there is a paper on this subject by Professor Malmsten. The known equa-

tions

   Section 1.--In entering on investigations relative to function 0,itis proper

to observe that two distinct notations are used to express the same four

series. It is now usual to write

   The former notation is obviously more convenient ; and as uniformity is
most desirable, I shall usually adhere to it. It will, however, be occasionally
necessary to make use of the second, as it is employed in Crelle's Journal in
many papers which I shall have to bring before the reader.

3i0 REPORT-- 1869.

 --Section 2. It will be proper, on every account, to commence this division

with an account of Jacobi's later researches relative to fimction 9. Three of
these are contained in the 36th volume of Crelle's Journal, and I shall con-
sider them ill succession. The first of these is entitled " Uber die unmit-
telbare Verification einer Fundamental-Formel der Theorie der elliptischeu
Functionen."

   It is proved in the ' Fundamenta Nova ' that if

n=(l-2=)(l-2^)...(l-2--)(l-fA)...(l-2.-')(l-2z-')...

S and n are equal, and we must therefore have

n _rfS i,d log
             rfS o fHog II

dq dq ' dz dz

   It appears, without much difficulty, that if (m) represent every whole
number from 1 to co , xpim) the sum of the factors of (m), jj all odd numbers
from 1 to infinity, i all whole numbers from -co to +co , these equations lead

to the following

mwhere SS refer to and jo as above explained. The object of the paper is

to prove these formulae, and I make the two following observations to faci-

litate its study.

   The first observation, in which S refers to p, is intended to illustrate

page 77.

   / +(-1)">2'"^'"^''~"'' S" (-iy'2yq'^^'''+P+^'^

+ + +=2""' (-l)'"(2i 7r)2'"<'"+"^ 2" (-l)"'(4i 2p)j92'"<'"+'P+'').

     -- {2i 1)
The second refers to page 78 ; there we have the following equation

--SS( 1) P2  =I,4^(m)q .

It would be better to write this in the following way

SS(-l) pq    =^^(>-)q ,

--since m(m +jj) and 2r are intended to be equivalent.
  Section 3. Jacobi's second paper is entitled " Ueber die partielle Differential
gleichiing welcher die Zahler und Nenner der elliptischen Function Genuge-
leisten." Jacobi at the commencement of his paper gives the following for-
mula without demonstration :

              ON ELLIPTIC AND HYPERELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS.
To prove this, wc remember the well-known expression

fl^(.r) is derived from 0(a-) by changing q into --q.

   Now if we change q into --q,

    1 T-,                 P sin (A cos d)

            ^F^ becomes FF^, and A becomes A-' ^A.

Substituting all these in the expression for Qix), we have

and this can also be found by difierentiating (6) with regard to'^. The induc-

--tion is completely proved. 1 think the reader will find no difficulty after

these remarks in reading this paper, one of the most beautiful productions
of its illustrious author, the paper reviewed in last section having been

previously studied.

 --Section 6. In the thirty-seventh volume of Crelle's Journal there is a me-

moir of Jacobi of a very different nature to those we have been reviewing.

Its title is " Ueber unendliche Eeihcn, deren cxponenten zuglcieh in zwei

verschiedenen quadratischen Formen enthalten sind." Many parts of this

memoir relate to the theory of numbers, and contain no allusion whatever to
the subject of this lleport ; nevertheless, as these investigations were sug-
gested by a formula in the ' Fuudamcnta Nova,' it will be right to give some

account of it here.

   From the well-known formula in the ' Fimdamcnta Xuva,'

                 (l_5=)(l_2'Xl-r/). . . (l-5r)(l-./--Xl-r/,^). ..

                 (l-^.-')(l-2^r-')(l-r/.-'). . .=

             +l-qiz + z-^) + q\z"- + z-^)-q\z' =-^)+ . ..,

--we deduce, by putting 2" for q and ±q^'' for z, the following expressions:

n{(i-r/''"+'"-")(i-- 2^"''+'"+''Xi-- 5-'"'+-''')}=2:(--i)V"''+"''.. . . (I.)

       + +n{(l               y2mi+m+H^(]^_^2m.+2m^^ =Vj'»>=+"'.
             22'"i+'"-'')(l                                                                                                                                                     .     (II.)

It is easy to see that these equations will lead to a multitude of others of

1869.                                                                           2A

the form

       n(l-f/"'+^)(l_5«^'+^)(l_5«3'+^), . . . =s^(-i)'+V''^*^''^"^'^
where / in the products has the values 0, 2, 3, &c., and in the summations i
and h have the vahies 0, +1, +2, +3, . . . .

   Jacobi has given a Table of these equations. I select three of them for
demonstration, which -Rill give an idea of the whole sufficient for our present

purpose.

   (1) n{{l-qf+\l-q''+y(l-rf'+')}=^(-n+''-f/''+^'''+\

   (2) n{(l-</+')(l-,/+2)(l_./+^y(l-,/'+«)=}

  =(3) n{(l-*/'+^y(l-.r/'+^)^} v(- l)'+^/''+2*^+'".

   By the formula (I.
                                                                          ),
          vc_2y+i- /_3i-'+3/.-+

     n{(i-.^)«'+^'(i-,/'>^)(i_./+«)n(i-r/+^)(i-^«'+^)a-5''+')},

consequently formula (I.) reduces itself to

or

                            n(i-5^'+^)=n(i-/"+^)(i -</'+'),
which is at once seen to be true.

   To prove the second formula, we observe that

by formula (I.) is equivalent to
     n(l-j3'+iXl-52'+-)(l-r/'+-^)n(l-5«'+3Xl-/''+3)(l-/'+'');

and the equation reduces itself to

the same as before.
   "We also have

-.(-1) q             =n(i -- J    XI -- J  XI --                     ).
                                                                 !/

a formula not noticed by Jacobi.

   To prove formula (3)' we have

  = ri(i-,/+^Xi-/'^'Xi-'/^')n(i-r/'+^)(i_./'--^Xi-'/''-'-');

and the equation reduces itself to

               n(i-,/+2xi_,/.--f4)^i_,/+G)=n(i-./'+^Xi-5^'+'')>

   These formiilge are applied by Heine to the expression of the fundamental
series in continued fractions. Thus from (4) we immediately obtain

_+ +»(a,/3 l,y l)                      I

         0(a./5,r)           (l-r)(l-g"-0       + + +<p(a l,li l,y 2)

Since

             + + _ + ++0(a l, |5 1, y 2) <^(/3 l, g+l. y 2)

             ++0(a,/3 l,y l)         + +0(/3 l,a,y l) '

by the very nature of the series represented by the functions, we can repeat

^7+this process and expand ^*-'''P+  ) -j^ ^ continued fraction. The re-

suit is      ^fg./g + l.y+l) _J_ajX a^ a^ a^

         '^  (l_2y+2)(l_2y + 3) ' ^ ^      (l_27+3)(l_jy+4) ·

When /3=0, (p(a,(3,y) becomes unity, and we obtain a continued fraction

+for 0(1, a, y 1), M'hich is immediately applicable to elliptic functions.

   From the nature of the series we have at once-

                    + +0(«+l,/3 l,/3 +l)=.^(« l,/3,/3).
--

ON ELLIPTIC AND HYPERELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS.                                      349

Consequently putting /3=y=l in (1) and (6), we immediately obtain the

following equation :

_--i^1-x0(a, 1, 1, q, x)=    ^(a, 1, 1, q, qx);

%-t.'.'a-r-'^^?·'· ^^^' ^' ^' '^' ''^'^=         '^^'"' ^' ^' '^' *"'''^'

and since q is siipposed less than unity, the series ^(a, 1,1, q, qKv) always
approaches unity as (h) indefinitely increases, and consequently

                                        (l-x){l-qx){l-q-x)....                ^^
Again, putting .r=2^~"~^ in scries (2), wc have

                               --J. jv

and repeating this process,

A?^(Ka>,l^7y>,12,, ^2V-a-^))=  (l-2V-0.---(l-gv-^+"-)
                                  (l_2y)....(l_2V+»-i)

                               +0(«-)-?i, /3, 7 n, 2, 2^-''-^;.

Now we have generally

+^(a «,/3,y+", 2' -'*-')     (l-g.^+»)(l-^.^+«-i)(l.-g^)(l-gg+.)

_, (l-^«+")(l-y^)

As («) increases without limit, this series approaches

Hence when (n) is infinite, we have by (10)

=+^(a+n, /3, y n, 3, gy-.-^)   ^^^(_1^--^Q_'^y-A«^)^(1-- 9v-»+i)/-_·_. _· _^

                                                   J^^_^_

and therefore                   (l-gy-<^) l-- f/Y-^+i).                       (11)
^(a,/3,y,g,9V-- P)                                              ( ...

  _-- " (i_^v)(l-- g'V+i)

   From these formidaj it will readily be perceived that the leading properties

of functions ti can be deduced. For the details I refer to Heine's second
paper, " Abriss einer Theorie der elliptischen Functionen," which will be
found in the thirty-ninth volume of Crelle's Journal, and which, after the
remarks here made, will offer no difficulty.

   There are some consequences of formula (11) just proved which I shall

insert in this place.

   If we put

we shall obtain from (11)

  --Section 8. The comparative simplicity of the functions naturally sug-

gested to mathematicians the utility of adopting these series as ground-forms
in the theory of elliptic transcendents. These functions have therefore been

in these last times the subject of many investigations. Among the memoirs
relating to these series, thi-ee may be particidarly mentioned as having re-

markably contributed to the advancement of our knowledge of their proper-
ties. These three papers are Jacobi's memoir " Sur la Eotation d'un Corps,"
in the thirty-ninth volume of Crelle's Journal, a paper by Krusemarck, " Zur
Theorie der elliy)tischen Functioncn," in the forty-sixth volume, and a paper
by Richclot, " TJeber cine Merkwurdige Formel in dcr Theorie dcr elliptischen

It is known that the decomposition of algebraical fractions leads to the fol-

lowing proposition :

  --sin(/3-- «)sin(/3 /))     1 +, sin (7--0) sin (7--6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1

--WeSection 12.  now proceed to give certain formulae relative to the differ-

ential coefficients of the logarithms of functions 0, essentially the same func-

tions, be it remembered, as those which Jacobi writes with the letter Z.

Schellbach's four fundamental equations are as follows :

                 r0,.r-re,7/=0/«,o'^(^l-±^                                (i)

-- --derived from the iirst by putting x kvi for x, and y };il for y. The third

Report on Mineral Veins in Carboniferous Limestone and their Organic

                   Contents. By Charles Moore^ F.G.S.

A CAKEFTJL consideration of the phenomena attending mineral veins needs

the aid of the physical geologist, the electrician, the chemist, the mineralo-
gist, and also, as I shall presently show, that of the paliEontologist, in order to
arrive at correct conclusions respecting their age, the materials they contain,

from whence those materials were derived, and the time when they were

subsequently deposited in them. Unfortunately I do not profess to have
any knowledge of some of these sciences, and the conclusions to which I
have arrived will therefore be based upon general observations, such as
could be given to the physical conditions of various mineral districts, and
the manner under which some of the veins have been formed and refilled.

    There are few subjects connected Avith the physical history of our globe
which have presented greater difiiculties in their elucidation, and few the
study of which have, up to this time, had less satisfactory or certain results
than the laws which have regulated our mineral deposits, the views enter-
tained having the wide divergence between a Plutonic and a Neptunian
origin for our minerals ; and although the tendency of opinion is probablj' in

the latter direction, it may be almost said that at this time there is no fixed

view on a subject of such great economic importance.

    The opinions of various authors may be chiefly classed under the heads of

" suhUmation" and " ser/regation," whilst those of Werner, that the minerals
in the veins have been derived from the waters of the ocean, and those
recently propounded by Mr. AVallace, that they owe their presence to atmo-
spheric causes and conditions in connexion with segregation, deserve at-

 tention.

    1st. By sublimation is meant that aU our minerals have been entirely

derived from the passage upwards of certain vapours yielding the minerals
through the veins, which have been vents from the heated interior of the

 earth.

    2nd. By segregation, that the minerals now found in veins were contem-

 poraneous with, and deposited in very minute quantities in the horizontal

 strata which now form the walls of the veins, and that by some mode or

 other they have subsequently been removed from the surrounding rocks and

 redeposited as they are now found in the veins.

    Minerals are only met with in the crust of the earth, in stratified beds,

 and in mineral veins.
       ON MINERAL VEINS IN CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE.                           361

   Under the first condition, it will be very generally admitted that the
materials from whence those minerals were derived must have been held in
solution in the waters of the ocean at the different periods when the stra-
tified beds containing them were being deposited, and that the lime, the silica,
the iron, which wiU be found more or less abundantly in every formation,
must have been, with few if any exceptions, precipitated contemporaneously.
Although the ores of copper, tin, lead, and other rarer minerals which are

found most frequently in veins may occasionally be detected in stratified

beds, it is evident, from the mere traces of them that are obtained over the
widest areas and in geological time, that the laws which were necessary to
their deposition so abundantly in veius, were in their case to a considerable

extent inoperative.

 --Physical conditions necessary to Mineral Veins. It is only stating a

truism to remark that the rocks in association with which onr mineral veins
are found are almost entirely of marine origin ; that they once formed the
bottom of ancient seas, and in their undisturbed conditions were laid down
horizontally, and were continuous, and without the enormous rents and

fissures which now traverse them in every direction. The mere contraction

of the beds during solidification would not be sufficient to account for the
phenomena, as in this case the fissures would not pass down continuously to
any depth. It appears, therefore, clear that all veins must be due to the
elevation or depression of the portion of the earth's crust in which they are

found, and that they are younger than or formed subsequently to the con-
solidation of the rocks enclosing them, their age depending on the period of

physical change.

   It would be difficult for any one not acquainted with mining operations to
reahze the enormous forces that have been in operation in different ages
to produce the dislocations necessary for the reception of our mineral lodes.
To the physical geologist there can be few more remarkable phenomena

than mining districts present, or than the study of a weU-prepared map of
any of our larger districts would show. As an instance, I may mention a
map of the Alston district, in Cumberland, prepared by Mr. Wallace, in
which it may be seen that, occupying very large areas, there is a complete
network of fissures, the same veins being traceable through many miles of
country, crossed by others at varying angles. I have also shown this to be

the case in the Mendip district *, where the east and west veius in passing
parallel with one another through that Une of country are repeatedly in-
tersected by cross courses, and to such an extent that numerous examples,

especially towards Frome, may be seen in almost every limestone-quarry.

    It being admitted that through the volcanic disturbances indicated the
fissured character of our rocks has been produced, it will be desirable to
consider the influence exercised by the ocean in refiHing the veins thus

caused.

   On examining caverns and fissures of the Carboniferous Limestone which
are now open, it can at once be seen, by the honeycombed and worn cha-

racter of the roofs and sides, that they must at some period have formed
channels or passages for large bodies of water. Although in most Carboni-
ferous-limestone districts it is known that " swallet holes " occur, through

which the water now passes down and traverses certain lines of open fissures

below, which form the natural drainage of the country, the stream some-
times reappearing miles away from whence it entered, still these are excep-

tional cases ; the great majority of the open fissures are beyond and without
this influence, and it must be obviously impossible, to any great extent,
where the fissures have been refilled, that there could be the passage of any
considerable bodies of water through them since they have obtained their
present elevations, in some instances amounting to several thousand feet
 above the sea-level. It appears to me, therefore, more probable that the de-
nudation to which they have been subject is due in great measure to the long-
 continued action of marine cm-rents, whilst the fissures, the upper jjarts of
 which afford the most striking evidence of this condition, still remained
 open beneath the sui'face of the ocean. This might have been for greatly
 extended periods, as there is evidence throughout the Mendip and South
 Wales districts that the Carboniferous Limestones formed the floor of the
 sea through Triassic, Liassic, and Oolitic times.

    After the disturbing influence by which the fissures were caused, their
 filling up by derived materials, and the time occupied thereby, must have
 depended upon local causes that were in operation in the several areas in
 which they occurred. In some instances, where little or no sedimentary
 matter was being derived from adjoining lands, or where no preexisting
 stratified deposits were being denuded, few materials for this purpose would
 be supplied, and a greater length of time would elapse before the fissures re-
 ceived their vein-stuff', of whatever kind, whilst ou the contrary they would

more or less speedily have received the deposits with which they are now
filled, subject, in either case probably, to a scouring out and occasional mo-

 dification of the material within their walls.

  --Contents of Fissures. In working for various minerals, it is usually found

 that the more precious contents of the veins are either in vertical strings, in
 bunches or pockets, or more rarely in flats, and that they form but a very

 small part of the contents of the fissures. When attention is given to the

 other materials which form by far the greater bulk of the infUhng, it wiU be
 found in some instances to be of a very varied character, those even in
 the same mine being most remarkable. Though in general there might be an
 agreement in the character of the deposit in the same mineral field or area,
 when separate districts are examined, the distinction is more marked ; often

--the material brought into the vein is conglomeratic, consisting of both angular

 and rolled pebbles in the former case probably derived from the adjacent
 walls of the vein, or from a source not far removed ; in the latter case, which
 is not an unfrequent one, the pebbles are from rocks not contemporaneous,
 some of which have therefore a foreign origin, and, either in being brought
 from a distance or from the subsequent action of the water in the fissure,
 have been as much rounded as are some of those found in the drifts of our
 superficial quaternary deposits. The cavernous interstices left in such con-
 glomerates are favourable to the deposition of minerals for which the veins
 are worked ; and where this is not the case, they are usually cemented to-
 gether by carbonate of lime, quai-tz, or some other material incident to the

 infilhng.

    Still more frequently, in many districts, from forming the great bulk of
 the infilling, the "dowky" portions, or the clays, of the veins are chai'gcd
 with varying deposits of a sandy nature, with marl or clay, or with a me-

 terial assuming a variegated or finely conglomeratic character, showing an
 admixture brought from diff'erent sources, or by the denudation of beds of

 different mineralogical conditions, analogous to stratified deposits when
 brought together by opposing currents. The variety in the character of the
 vein-stuff is at times most marked; and there may be obtained from the
ON MINERAL VEINS IN CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE.  363

same rein samples of "dowks" which, when washed, give almost every

conceivable hue of colour, from the most delicate French white to the
densest shades of black or indigo, all being due to the different chemical
or mineralogical conditions of the matrix. Additional evidence is afforded
of the derived nature of the " dowks" by the occasional presence in them of
fossil wood. I have found a piece in the Charterhouse Mine, converted
into jet, with the cellular portions containing galena ; and another example
is recorded from the HudgiU Burn Mine, the exterior of which was covered
with galena. Whenever in a given area a series of fissures were open at
the same time, and subject to the same conditions of deposition, it is quite
possible that certain horizons of infilling might be found in them, though,
from the pecuUar circumstances attending them, their recognition would

involve close observation.

   Having said thus much of the fissures and their more unprofitable con-
tents, I now proceed to consider the views that have been usually enter-

--tained as to the deposition of the minerals therein.
    Views of Mineral Deposition. Next to the one which I shall hereafter
suggest of a purely marine origin for the minerals, I believe that of sub-
limation to have the greatest probability ; but there are, I think, many

reasons against this supposed cause.

    It necessarily involves, what was most likely the fact, that the fissures
originally continued downwards untU they reached the source of volcanic
action, which in some instances must have been seated at an enormous
depth. The moment the fissures were opened, of whatever width, if within
the influence of the ocean, they must have been filled by its waters, and
liable more or less quickly to receive their now varied contents. Their
lower depths would naturally be first filled. "Where the rents passed
through, as must often have been the ease, soft and yielding beds, tliis might
often have occurred quickly, in others only after a great lapse of time. Were
the doctrine of sublimation true, we ought, I think, to have greater evidence

of the continued passage iipwards of volcanic fluids, in the very lowest depths,
instead, as is most often the case, of finding our minerals high up in the veins,
or occurriug chiefly on given horizons in them, or even in pockets at their

surfaces. It appears to me also that the " dowks " or clays through which

60 subtle and potent an agent must have been continually passing, charged with
its varied minerals, must have shown much greater evidence of its effects than

is now seen in them, and that they would more frequently have tended to

precipitate the minerals before they could have passed so far upwards in the

vein in which they are now more frequently found.
   The doctrine of segregation, which at this time appears to have most

believers, is, I think, open to greater objection than that of sublimation.
Its disciples believe that, subsequently to the movements which have caused

the fissures, a process has been going on which even now is collecting the

various minerals together towards a fixed point, according to their natural

afiinities, extracting them from the adjoining rocks, and rcdepositing them
in the veins. This view is purely imaginary and incapable of proof, aud

seems to me as impossible as the idea I had when a boy, that if you planted

a stone, in process of time it might grow into a mountain. There seems to

me no possibility bow, under this supposition, any mineral can be with-

drawn, and necessarily replaced by another totally different, involving a cir-
culatory movement continually in progress in the matrix of some of our
most extensive geological formations. Probably, as regards their chemical
constituents, there are no more homogeneous rocks than the great series of the

                                                                   2b2

of our lead, calamine, and iron-ore                                                                                                                                          and chemical analysis will show that the

constituents necessary to the production of these minerals are almost entirely

absent from them over the widest areas. The limestones that come nearest

in contact with the walls of strong mineral lodes ought, with this view,

to yield the best evidence that the minerals have been thus segregated to-

gether ; but it wiU be found that they are as free from the minerals that are

in the veins as would be samples taken at any distance from the fissures.

Under this head it is desirable I should notice a view lately suggested by

Mr. "Wallace. This gentleman has lately published an elaborate work on

' The Laws which regulate the Deposition of Ores in Veins,' which, though

having special reference to the Alston-Moor district, is proposed by him as a

law explaining the ore-deposits in all mineral veins. His work shows an

intimate knowledge of the complicated physical details of that extensive

mining-region, in which, in opposition to sublimation, he remarks, that all

the lead-veins are found most productive where furthest removed from the

seat of Plutonic action, the richest deposits being in the upper part of the

Carboniferous Limestone where no igneous rocks are found, and that in that

district there is nothing to support the theory that lead is due to exhalations

from below, or to matter injected in a fluid state among the consolidated

sedimentary rocks. Instead of this he states that the more probable cause

of the lead-ore at Alston is owing to segregation from, or decomposition

of, the rocks which form the walls of the veins where they are found. In

adopting the doctrine of segregation, he proposes, for the first time, to com-

bine with it another cause, without which there would be no important de-

posits of minerals, viz. that of recent hydrous and atmospheric agency.

Without the passage of large bodies of water downwards from the surface,

derived from the rainfall of the district, and their free circulation in the

veins, there would be no conditions favourable to the deposit of minerals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

in aU cases he states such deposits are found only where fluids most freely

percolate the surface and circulate in the veins, and that these conditions

only occur where the strata are situated at moderate depths from the sur-

face, and at some considerable distance from the watershed of the moun-

tain                  that,  combined                                    with  electrical                                                                                    action,  these  agents  have   been  the  means

of extracting the minerals from the adjoining rocks ; that the operation is

still in progress, and that aU has been accomplished since the Glacial period.

The examination I have given to mineral veins and their contents does not

support this view. The chief material of all mineral veins I find to be of

mariae origin                                                            all the organic  contents are fossil, and                                                                                   their  precise geologi-
                                                                      ;

cal age can be arrived at Avithout much difiiculty. Wherever they contain

land shells, as on the Mendips, or freshwater shells, which occur in the

veins of Alston, and are wide-spread elsewhere, they are also fossU and of

contemporaneous age with the other remains*. It is certain from this that

the veins received their infilling when within the influence of the ocean, and

before their present elevation, since which time, as I have before stated, I
doubt if there could be any material alteration in their contents.

   But supposing their vein-stuff to be postglacial, and that their deposit had
been efi'ected by large bodies of water passing down through them from the

surface, ample evidence would have been present of the fact ; for in the place

of fossU organic remains, which in some instances indicate the exact age of
the minerals, there would have been found recent land and freshwater

                      * See remarks on the presence of Land and Freshwater Shells, p. 369.
ON MINERAL VEINS IN CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE.  365

shells and plants abundantly. Of this, through a long examination of the
contents of mineral veins, I have seen no evidence either in the Alston or

any other mining-district.
    Postpliocene caverns and fissures have, however, remained open to this

time, in many instances, in our Carboniferous-limestone ranges ; and although

they have been within the influence of, and subject to, the effect suggested by

Mr. Wallace, their organic contents consist chiefly of the extinct mammaUa

of that period, whUst their mineral deposits are confined to the stalactitic
and stalagmitic deposits on their roofs and floors which have been slowly

accumulating since the postpliocene period.

   The Neptunian theory, fh-st advanced by Werner for the origin of mine-
rals, would probably before this have received greater attention but for the
other extravagant ideas he connected with it. I shall now offer some sug-

gestions regarding its probable truth.

   It appears to me necessary, in the first place, that, for the production of

minerals, there should be the following elements or conditions, viz. the pre-
sence of the minerals themselves in the waters of the ocean, open fissures
communicating therewith, favourable electrical conditions, and time for

their precipitation.

    It has now been established, without doubt, by the highest chemical
authorities, that many of our most important minerals are present in minute
quantities in the waters of the ocean. This is admitted by those who be-

lieve in segregation, the difference being that they think it was first de-
posited and afterwards extracted from the parent rock, and redeposited in

 the veins, rather than originally collected in the veins themselves.
    As regards the connexion subsisting between the ocean and the vein-

 fissures, I beheve it wiU be recognized to be the case that, in the great
 majority of instances, the different veins come directly to the surface, and
 wherever a later rock has been deposited, which is only in exceptional cases,
 covering up the mouth of the vein, there will stiU be found a break in the
 sequence of the strata, which might give almost unlimited time for the pre-

 cipitation of the minerals therein. "WTierever systems of veins occur, it is

 probable there wiU be found connected there-nith an abnormal condition
 and considerable breaks in the deposition of the rocks. I have shown this
 to be the case in connexion with the Carboniferous Limestone of the Mendip
 range, and its continuation through South Wales, in which districts it can
 be seen that those rocks were, through enormous periods, exposed to the

 influence of the ocean, possibly forming reef-like barriers around the edges
 of the carboniferous basin, the fissured veins and floor of this sea-bottom
 receiving at some periods materials of Ehaetic or of Lower or Middle Lias
  age, whilst an occasional capping of the beds of Inferior Oolite, left in some

 Carboniferous Limestone trough, now and then cover up the mouths of the
  veins that had received aU their contents prior to its deposition. Some
  most instructive examples are present in this district, in which it may be

  seen that whilst there are on the walls of the vein the usual vertical con-
  ditions of vein-stuff, such as calespar, suljAate of barytes, &c., with occa-

  sional haematite iron-ore, calamine, and galena, the central portion of the

  vein is unmistakably of Liassic or Rhsetic age. In all such instances there

  are combined the elements of open fissures communicating with the ocean,

 --and greater or less time in the reception of their contents.
      Various Ages of Minerals. It wiU be found that minerals generally occur
  in the oiitcrops of lines of strata, possibly occupying, to some extent, the
  same relative positions, as regards the strata by which they are now sur-

rounded, as in earlier times, and that the mineral-bearing rocks formed the
floor or backbone on which the later beds were laid down. This is the case
with Australian and Californian auriferous regions, the enormous denuda-
tion and consequent drifts of Tertiary age in the former case having laid
bare the backbone of the auriferous-bearing rock below. I have ah'eady shown
this to be the case with the Carboniferous Limestones of the west of England
and South Wales, where, in connexion with them, veins and pockets of
mineral-bearing lias are found. Liassic minerals, again, occur on what is
probably a continuation of the same great barrier, which, passing under the
south-eastern counties, crosses the channel to France, where they are seen
on a floor of granite. The outcrops of some of the limestones of i^^^orth
Wales and the north of England have been exposed to the influence of seas
certainly as late as the Coal-measures and the minerals found in the great
mining-districts of Cornwall, whether in the killas or the granite itself, are
found connected with, or resting upon, a great backbone of the latter rock.

    It is also worthy of remark that the conglomerates usually skirting the
edge of the limestone, which must long have been subject to the action of the
ocean, are large receptacles of iron, calamine, and lead, the veins in which
seldom, if ever, pass downwards into the hmestone, and which, though open
to the ocean, are cut oflpfrom sublimation beneath. The fissures in these great
lines of submarine mountains must necessarily have been chiefly filled with
marine matter, whether mineral or otherwise ; sometimes, where the mate-
rials were friable, supplied by the walls of the fissure, but perhaps oftener
derived. Wherever there has l3een a rapid filling up of the veins by a homo-
geneous material, the element of time is excluded, such as with the " dowky"
portions of the veins, and in such cases workable minerals are seldom found.
The same occurs where there is a sequence of deposition, and stratification
follows without a break in natural order. If the above view be correct, it
follows that the longer a fissure has been exposed to the influence of the
ocean, the greater will be the probability of a larger supply of minerals
therein. Where veins have been slowly filled, where they have been
cavernous, or by subsequent movements have been opened on several occa-
sions, where they contain conglomeratic infiUings, or have been kept open by
currents, favourable conditions to deposition occur ; and it is a well-known
law of mining that, at the junction where veins intersect, rich deposits or
pockets of minerals are most usually found, from the fact that at such points
there has been a scouring out of the fissures, and a longer time given for

precipitation.

 --Palceontohgy of Mineral Veins. The physical views I have suggested are

strongly supported by the investigations I have for some time been pursuing
regarding the presence of organic remains in mineral veins. During those
investigations I have examined materials derived from Carboniferous-lime-
stone veins and fissures from the mining-districts of Wharfedale, Wensley-
dale, Weardale, Teesdale, Swaledale, Alston Moor, Keswick, North and

South Wales, and Somersetshire ; and I am much indebted, for the facilities
they have aff'orded me in their several districts, to Lord Bolton and Messrs.

Wallace, Walton, Eddy, Bainbridge, Cain, Peart, Wasley, and Sopwith.
    It is remarkable, considering the enormous mine-workings and the quan-

tity of vein-stufi^ brought to the surface in every part of the world, that so
few notices of the presence of fossils in them should have occurred. In his

' Elements of Geology,' p. 762, Sir Charles Lyell mentions that M. Virlet
had found a Gryphaja in a lead-mine near Semur in France, and that a
madrepore had been seen in a compact vein of cinnabar in Hungary, the pre-

 sence of which were accounted for by their being transported thither during
 submarine earthquakes.

    An examination of the veins in the former case might indicate the presence
 of many other shells, and probably show the age of the veins of that district

 to be Liassic or Oolitic. In the latter case, also, other remains might be found,
 and yield additional confirmation of the views I have propounded.

    One reason for the non-discovery of organic remains has arisen from their
 being generally of small size, and that the vein-stuff in which they have to

 be sought for is often of a very intractable character, resisting the action of
the water by which it has to be dissolved before they can be washed out of
it, after which the residuum requires almost microscopic examination for

their separation. In the process of washing away the "dowks," it is inter-
esting to notice the very varied tints with which they colour the water,

 according to the mineralogical character of the material to be operated upon,
which differs in separate districts, and on different levels or horizons in the
same mine.

    The organic remains thus obtained are occasionally even more varied, as
regards geaera and species, than if they had been derived from a given
horizon of stratified deposits, arising perhaps from the length of time within
which the fissure might have been open, and the necessarily mixed condition
consequent upon the fiUing up of the vein. Some from the Carboniferous
Limestone itself are associated with those which are foreign or derived.
In the case of the Charterhouse Mine on the Mendips, those which are of
Liassic age, and consequently derived, are in the proportion of about 90 to
30 from the older rocks within the walls of which they are found. In the
Carboniferous-limestone districts of Holwell and Frome, Rhaetic and Liassic

organisms are also in large proportion ; and the same may generally be said

throughout the Mendip range and South Wales. In North Wales and the
north of England, on the contrary, Carboniferous- limestone remains are the
most frequent ; those of later age are the exceptions, some of these being

Entomostraca of Permian species, which may be common to the two series,

and Foraminifera, which have a long range upwards. The precise later age

of the vein-infillings is therefore, in their cases, not so clearly defined as in

the south-west of England. In the Fallowfield Mine and the Silver Band

Mines, Flemincfites gracilis, a seed of the coal-period, occurs, whilst at Gras-

sington and Mold small particles of coal are occasionally present in the
" dowks," which at Fallowfield and in the Swaledale district are so like
material from the coal-shales that it is reasonable to infer that the veins are
contemporary with, or subsequent to, the coal-period.

   Nothing can weU be more remarkable than the Mendip veins with their

infillings of secondary age, high up on the Carboniferous-Umestone table-
land, and with no stratified deposits of lias within several miles. In the
case of the Charterhouse Mine, from the variety in the contents of the
fissures, there is ample evidence that a considerable time must have elapsed
within which they remained more or less open, and during which various
oceanic influences were at work. At 270 feet, the lowest depth of the
shaft, there is found a deposit of blue or greenish clay, 10 feet in thickness,
which has yielded the Liassic fossils given below. This, on the same level,
occasionally changes from a homogeneous marl to patches of a more conglo-
meratic material with enclosed water-worn pebbles. Higher up the vein it
becomes a dense conglomerate. Above this, sandy-looking deposits occur,
which, when washed, are seen to be almost entirely composed of the de-
tached stems of encrinites very much abraded, with small washed pebbles of

aU these changes, and others which might be mentioned, indicate the many

conditions that were in operation before the fissure had finally received its
contents, whilst still within the ocean's influence, and possibly before the
final elevation of the Meudip range. In this district the minerals "prove"
near the surface, but they are occasionally found below, and detached
crystals of galena are not unfrequent in the Liassic clay at the bottom.

   In the following list, which is extracted from my paper " On the Abnormal

Condition of Secondary Deposits," &c., it will be seen what a large fauna
occurs within the walls of the lead-vein, that most of the great palaeontolo-
gical groups are therein represented, and that they clearly indicate its precise

geological age.

Considerable palseontological interest attaches to the presence, under these

peculiar conditions, of such genera as Helix, Proserpina, and Vertigo, as,

with one exception, they are the earliest recognized land shells, and also to

Valvata, Hydrobia, and Planorhis, the oldest freshwater genera yet known.

In the paper above mentioned, I referred to the difficulty that exists in

always assigning the shells of different ages, when thus mixed together, to their

true geological horizons. Although in general this difliculty does not occur,

it may happen with those which are new, or have not been previously stra-

tigraphically recognized.

   It was not unnatural that I should have supposed these land and fresh-
water shells, when accompanied by a large Liassic fauna, to be of the same
age ; but with regard to the Valvata anomala, the V. pygmaa, and the

Planorhis Mendipensis, the evidence I have since obtained of the presence of

these shells in the mining- districts of the North, leads me to the conclusion

that it is probable that these land and freshwater species are rather to be

assigned to the earlier period of the Carboniferous Limestone, a fact that

will still enhance their palfeontological interest. The presence also of other
freshwater genera, to be hereafter noticed, occurring in considerable num-

bers in the veins, induces me to think that there are some freshwater beds
connected with the Carboniferous Limestone from whence they may have
been derived which have yet to be discovered ; and I hope my geological
friends who are working in Carboniferous-limestone districts will turn their
attention to this point ; for of all formations, less, I believe, is really known

or realized of the great physical, palseontological, and other changes which

have occurred during the Carboniferous period than of most other geological

deposits, and there yet remains a great work for some geologists to take up in

this direction.

In other mining-districts organic remains are generally less plentiful

than in the Mendip area ; but I have not failed to detect them, more or less
abundantly, except in one instance, in that of the Cononley Mine in the

Airdale district. It often happens that, though they are wanting in some

samples of the " dowks," they may still be obtained from otliers at higher or

lower levels in the same mine. Although they have in all instances been

selected promiscuously for examination, fossils have been found in more

than one half of the samples.

   The following lists of " dowks," with notes of their organic contents, are
selected to show the general character of the vein-stuff after it has been
prepared by washing.

   Whilst the various mines and mineral deposits I have examined have

certain species in common, it may be said that they have each special palte-

ontological featui'cs of their own.
   In the Keld-Head Jliues organic remains are very abundant at about

450 feet from the surface, amongst which are many Foraminil'era, chiefly

of the genus Livolutina, of which there are six species, and univalves of
about twelve genera, the freshwater genera Valvata anomala, Moore, and
Planorbis Mendipensis, Moore, being present, and also Entomostraca of
several new species.

    The Fallowlield mines, although not yielding a very long list of species,
have their special interest in the presence of the laud and freshwater
geneva, Stoastoma'?, Hydrobia, and Pisidium ; Involutina, as in the Keld-Head
mines, though rarely ; and a single seed of the Flemingites gracilis, Carr.
The richest samples from this mine are at 90 and 450 feet from the surface.

    The Grassington mines are not oiily very rich in individual specimens,
but have yielded the greatest number of species, amongst which are again
!

ON MINERAL VEINS IN CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE.  375

freshwater remains of Hydrohia, Planorhis, Valvata, and Lithoc/lyphus.

Entomostraca of at least ten species, Conodonts of several varieties, and fish-
remains of the genera Petalodus, Orodus, &c.

   The Alston mines have yielded about twelve species of univalves, though
they are not in good condition ; Eoraminifera are present, but are rare, and

fish-remains of the genera Petalodus.

   The Weardale mines, and those of Allenheads, are comparatively not rich,
the vein-stuff in them being much mineralized. Conodonts occur in the former,

Entomostraca rather abundantly in the latter, and also, though rarely, the
genus Hydrohia. In these veins, and also at Alston, I have detected, for

the first time, large cells of a foraminiferous shell, for which Mr. Brady
suggests the generic name Carteria.

   In the White and Silver Band mines remains are somewhat rarely dis-

tributed, the richest deposit being a friable ochreous sandstone, on the "sun"
side of the Silver Band Old Mine, which yielded many specimens of Hydrohia,
and one or two of Valvata anomala, several genera of Foraminifera, includ-

ing Irivolutina and Dentalina, with Conodonts and portions of teeth of Psam-

modus.

   The Mount-Pleasant mines of Mold contain Foraminifera, and also the

freshwater Hydrohia, though rarely, and Conodonts rather abundantly; but
they are especially remarkable for the great variety of fish-remains they
yield, which ajipear to represent at least ten different genera. Mixed with
the " dowks" of the mine are occasionally small pieces of laminated stone,
the surfaces of which exhibit numerous traces of fish-scales.

   Tlie researches I have been making have involved very considerable labour
and minute investigation; but as they will to some extent have opened iip a
new field of inquiry, I hope they will not be without some results. Before

concluding, I desire to refer to several of the more interesting palaeontological
facts wliich have been obtained.

 --Flemingites yraciJis, Carr. These are the almost microscopic sporangiiB or

seeds of a coniferous tree of the Carboniferous period, which have been

described and figured by my friend Mr. Carruthers in the ' Geological Maga-
zine,' vol. ii. p. 443, my first acquaintance with which was by finding a

single specimen in the Fallowfield Mine, followed soon after by another
from the Silver-Band mines. It is remarkable, when a key is once obtained
to the discovery of certain organic remains, how soon our knowledge of the

class may be increased. In the instance of these minute seeds, I have since
found them abundantly in the Carboniferous series of Staffordshire, and within

the last few weeks more abundantly still in the Coal-measures of Kadstock,
Somersetshire. At this j^lace there is a horizontal bed of some thickness,
intercalated with the coal-seams, which appears to be almost wholly composed

of these little organisms ; and, extraordinary as it may seem, it is not far
from the truth when I say that I could supply specimens of them by the

--ton weight
   Conodonts. In many of the lists of fossils I have given, the presence of
these curious organisms may be seen. Hitherto they have not been found
by any one but myself above Lower Silurian rocks, though no doubt they
may henceforth be detected in the strata of great thickness intervening be-

tween the Ludlow bone-bed and the Carboniferous period from whence my

specimens come. I have not only found them in the lead-veins, but also in
stratified beds of Carboniferous Limestone at Almondsbury near Bristol.

   The series of these remarkable microscopic bodies I have discovered yield
much greater variety than any hitherto obtained, and consequently present
                                                                         ;

376 REPORT-- 1869.

additional diiSculty in determining their affinities. They are generally either

lustrous or horny in their appearance, or dull, according to the matrix in

Mywhich they are found.  collection of them affords certain well-marked

recurrent types, which enable a certain amount of classification to be given

to them ; and though, taking the group as a whole, their forms are about as

eccentric as can be imagined, they still do not appear to pass one into

another. The simplest form is almost identical in shape with that of a

minute conical fish-tooth. Next comes another, not unlike the central cusp

of a hyboid tooth, with lateral bosses at the base. Another group possesses

an arched base, the simplest form in which has an elevated central curved

Atooth, with a smaller projecting tooth on cither side.  second form has

four elevated slightly curved teeth, with smaller teeth at the sides and in

the interspaces, whilst a still more elaborate one possesses a single elevated

central curved tooth, with about twelve regularly arranged, close-set smaller

Aones on either side.  third group have their teeth arranged on an irregular

or waved base, the forms of which are almost too eccentric for description.

In one there are nine curved teeth, arranged somewhat symmetrically, gra-

duating in height to the centre, but with a much larger fang at one end

a second form has five tapering teeth, followed by four others, much more

depressed and extended beyond the base. One kind presents a miniature

representation of the jaw of Ehizodus, with large teeth widely separated,

Aand irregularly dispersed small teeth within.  remarkable form possesses

a long curved tooth at one end, throwing off a semicircular spur, which passes

under a base-line, on the top of which follow numerous small depressed re-

gular teeth, the next two becoming much elevated, whilst the last is still

more so, extending much beyond the basal end. Another series, which has a

lengthened straighter base-line, is furnished in some instances with ser-

rations as close-set and minute as are the bristles on an insect's limbs.
In the width, form, and curvature of the teeth, these present various modi-
fications. Although in the above short descriptions I have by no means

exhausted the variety they present, I shall only notice here another kind,

which is the most abundant, and similar to one previously found in the Ludlow
bone-bed. This presents a somewhat club-shaped form, the thicker end

having in the centre a depression, bounded on the margin by a raised edge,
furnished with very minute serrations, which are united at about the centre

of the body, and are continued beyond in a very thin slightly curved handle,

Awhich is also furnished with close comb-like teeth.  familiar illustration

of this Conodont would be that of an old-fashioned rat-trap. Its base pos-
sesses a somewhat triangular hoUow, indicating that it might have been

attached at this part to some soft body.
   These curious fossils were first found by Pander, in Silurian beds in

Russia ; and considering that they belonged to and were the teeth of fish,
he created 13 genera and 56 species, according to the forms they presented.
In almost every instance the specimens I have found differ from those of

the Sihirian beds, and present much more diversity. Several of the Russian
varieties were, for the fii'st time, noticed in the Ludlow bone-bed by Dr.

Harley, who, in a paper in the 'Geological Journal,' 18G1, p. 549, suggests

that they may be minute spines attached to the tail of a crustacean, such as

Ceratiocaris.

   They have more recently been noticed by Professor Owen, in a note to

the last edition of ' Siluria,' p. 544, in which he also points out the improba-

Hebility of their being allied to fish.  then remai'ks that certain parts of

small Crustacea, such as the pygidium or tail of minute Entomostraca, resemble
       .

       ON MINERAL VEINS IN CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE.      377

in shape the more simple Conodonts ; but that against this view was the fact

that no shells of Entomostraca or other crustaceans had ever been found

in the Conodont beds, and that it was improbable therefore that they could

have belonged to an organism as susceptible of preservation as their own

substance. Although I may agree with the opinion of Professor Owen, that

these bodies do not belong to Entomostraca, I do so for other reasons. In

the first place, although his remarks may apply to the SUui-ian Conodonts,

he is wrong in supposing that they do not occur in the same beds with

Entomostraca ; for it happens that most of my specimens from the Carboni-

ferous Limestone are found in beds crowded with Entomostraca, which occur

also in the lead-veins, these two sources having yielded me about 40 species.
The great variety my series of Conodonts presents is decidedly against refer-

ring them to Entomostraca ; and what is, I think, suiRciently conclusive is

the fact that they are usually of greater size than the crustaceans, to which

they would thus be attached. The conclusion to which he arrives respect-

ing them is, that they were united to a soft perishable body, and that

they have most analogy with the spines, booklets, or denticles of naked

MoUusks and Annelides. There is no doubt great difficulty attending their

elucidation, and the above view, though not, I think, quite satisfactory,

appears as probable as any other that has been advanced. One objection to

it is the variety of forms they present, and that we have no existing ana-

logues. To whatever they belonged, the creatures yielding them probably

passed away with Palasozoie times, as I have found no trace of them in my
examinations of any later deposits. It has always been my object, when

seeking them in the Carboniferous Limestone, to find their association with

some other organized body, but in this I have always failed. They invari-

ably occur as separate detached specimens, and without any arrangement as

regards one another.

Entomostraca.--The bivalve Crustacea included in this family, although

not individually numerous, are present in nearly every vein I have exa-

mined. They have been in the hands of my friend Professor Rupert Jones,

who has provisionally determined about 29 species from the veins, including

those of Charterhouse and Weston, the great majority of which are new.

They include the genera Bairdia, Beyrichia, Cythere, Cytherella, Kirkbia,

and Moorea, the genus Cythere alone having as many as seventeen species.

 --Foraminifera Oui' knowledge of some of this very beautiful class of

microzoa will be considerably extended by those I have been fortunate

enough to obtain from the lead-vein deposits. This will especially apply to

the genus Involutina, which until lately was chiefly known by a single

species of/, liassica, Jones, sp., many specimens of which I have found in

the Liassic deposit in Charterhouse Mine. More recently M. Terquem's

researches in the Lias of the north-west of France have brought to light

several new forms belonging to the same type, four of which, viz. I. poly-

morpTia, I. aspcra, I. silicea, and /. nodosa, all supposed to belong to the

secondary age, are represented in my gatherings from the Carboniferous-

MyLimestone veins.    series not only carries back the above secondary species

to deposits of Palaeozoic times, but associated with them are nine others, so

that under these peculiar conditions there are not less than fourteen species of

this hitherto little-known genus. Bentalina pauperata, D'Orb, a now living

species, which has been traced back through Tertiary, Liassic, and Permian

formations, not only in this series goes back to the Carboniferous Lime-

stone, but I have also obtained it in the "VVenlock shales, an evidence of a

delicate microscopic shell having existed through a long series of ages to our

own times. &The Tinoporus Icevis, P. J., another recent species, will pro-

bably be added to the list, though it requires more examination, together
with the recent species Textularia sagittida, Defrance, and the genus Fusu-

lina. The cells of the new genus Carteria have since been found somewhat

abundantly on the decomposed edges of the Carboniferous-limestone rock of
ElfhiUs. Thus there are twenty-one species of Carboniferous-limestone
Foraminifera unexpectedly making their appearance for the first time in

--mineral veins, three of which have lived on to this day.
   Land and Freshwater Shells. Not the least important fact in my mine

explorations has been the discovery of a land and freshwater fauna.
Until I obtained the three genera of Helix, Vertigo, and Proserpina, with
the freshwater genera Planorbis and Valvata, in the Charterhouse Mine,
the only known terrestrial shell below the secondary beds was the Piqja
vetusta, Daw., found by Sir Charles Lyell and Dr. Dawson in the Coal-

measures of Nova Scotia. To the above genera I have now to add those of

Hydrohia, Stoastoma ?, Lithoglyphus, and Pisidium, from the mines of the
north of England, some of which I have little doubt are older than the
Pupa vetusta of the coal-beds. There is thus the fact of the presence of
nine genera of land and freshwater shells in the lead-veins of this country.

    In addition to the list of organic remains which follows, numbering about
112 species from the north of England and North-Wales mines, eight,
which are not in common, have been obtained from Weston, and to these
again are to be added 89 in the list previously given from Charterhouse,
so that in true and workable mineral veins I have found 209 species. In
the Carboniferous Limestone^of the Frome district precisely similar pheno-

mena occur, though the fissures are not worked. These Ehsetic and Liassic
veins have yielded me about 70 species, so that, including the districts I

have enumerated, I have obtained from vein-fissures, with their deposits of
different ages, about 279 species of organic remains.

   Under these peculiar circumstances, I have discovered the oldest known
Mammalia, the oldest land and freshwater Mollusca, about 52 species of

fish, and about 8 of Reptilia, besides the other groups to which reference

has been made.
    The list of species from Charterhouse Mine previously given and those

from Weston are not included in the following list. The species of Forami-
nifera marked " Brady " are new to science, and descriptions of them will be
found in Mr. H. B. Brady's " Notes on the Foraminifera " immediately
following this Report, as well as a provisional notice of the new genus

 Carteria.

Notes on the Foraminifera of Mineral Veins and the adjacent Strata.

                        By Henry B. Bkadt, F.L.S.

The following " notes " on the Foraminifera obtained by Mr. Charles Moore

in his investigations on the palaeontology of mineral veins are necessarily

incomplete. When presented there had been neither time nor opportunity

for any close comparison of the specimens with the fossil Rhizopoda of

periods immediately preceding and succeeding the horizon at which the veins

occur. Hitherto the Foraminifera of the Carboniferous epoch have never

been seriously studied, partly from the difficiUty of obtaining rocks that can

be disintegrated without injury to the fossil microzoa, and partly from the

obscurity in which the early types are involved, owing to the obliteration of

many of their structural peculiarities.

Under these circumstances it is not surprising that a large proportion of

the specimens in the collection represent forms not previously described.

Excepting those belonging to the genus Involutina, the Foraminifera are

--remarkable for their want of well-defined characters zoological and physical

causes having alike contributed to obscure the peculiarities they may have

had when living.

The Nodosarince are represented by examples of two forms, namely, a

single specimen identical in contour with Nodosaria radicula, Linne, sp.,

having well-defined subglobular chambers, and two or three shells having the

--general charactei's of DentaJlna pauperata, D'Orbigny, a cylindrical, slightly

arcuate, and tapering test, with little or no constriction at the septa. The

roughened and possibly partially sandy investment which all these specimens

present, throws some difRculty in the way of placing them amongst the No-

dosarince                                       but  inasmuch  as  the  doubtfully  arenaceous  appearance  may  be  due
                                             ;

to the subcrystalliue structure of the matrix on the one surface or the mine-

ral infiltration of the chambers on the other, whilst in all morphological re-

lations their characters are completely Nodosarian, separation from the group

seems scarcely justifiable.

The Textularice in the collection are very irregular in their growth, and

by no means constantly biserial. They resemble some of the varieties of
T. sagittida, Defrance, more than any other described species ; but it may be
necessary, or at least convenient, to assign a distinctive name to this primi-

tive and variable form.

   One or two obscure shells, regarded originally as Tinoporus Icevis, P. & J.,

are more probably a new species of Involutina, having an analogous acervu-

line mode of growth.

Some other minute and very obscure organisms in Mr. Moore's collection

appear to be young examples of Fusidina, a genus of Carboniferous Forami-

nifera well known in its mature condition.

  A number of bodies of larger size, shaped like spheres drawn out at two

opposite portions of their periphery, and distinctly arenaceous in their struc-

ture, have been regarded as joints of a gigantic Lituola, pending material for

more complete examination. The produced ends appear to have been slender

stoloniferous tubes ; and a number of the chambers may have been joined

together, forming a mouiliform test of some length*.

But the most interesting portion of the collection consists of the series of

specimens of the genus Involutina, which place the relations of that type in

   * Since the examination of the specimens from mineral veins, the author has learnt
that the same fossil has been discovered in the Carboniferous Limestone of Northum-

berland by Sir W. C. Trevelyan. The anticipations above expressed are found in the

main to be correct, but it has been thought necessary to separate the organism from Litvolti
proper, and the new generic term Carteria has been employed for it.

an entirely new light. The varieties of this genus described by M. Terquem

from specimens found in the Lias formation of the north-east of France,
comprised only a few outspread, discoidal, rotalian forms of finely arenaceous

--texture and variable septation a series, in point of fact, structurally allied

to Trochammina, but with some morjihological resemblance to Rotalia.
   The modifications, both in structui'e and mode of growth, exhibited in the

forms about to be described, place the type on a much extended basis ; and
it will be seen how large a number of the simpler Foraminifera have their

analogues in the varieties of this polymorphic genus.
    So far from being, as hitherto supposed, an essentially Liassic type, the

genus Involutina has its fullest and most characteristic development in the

Carboniferous period.

    Of abeady described species the followiug have been found in mineral
veins and the adjacent stratified rocks :

Involutina Liassica, Jones, sp.       Involutina nodosa, Terquem.
                                             ,, aspera, Terquem (?).
       ,, polymorpha, Terquem.
       ,, silicea, Terquem.

   In addition to these there are a large number of forms not before noticed,
of which brief descriptions are now presented. The definition of their cha-
racters must be regarded as provisional to some extent, and founded on Mr.
Moore's specimens. The elucidation of the type is as yet by no means com-
plete ; but, through the kindness of Mr. Young of Glasgow, Mr. Leipner, and

Mr. W. W. Stoddart of Bristol, materials for more extended observations have

been placed at the author's disposal, which will form the basis of a future

memoir.

chambers long, narrow, often curved ; septal hues not constricted, but

in many eases marked by a radiate sutural limbation.

J. crassa, n. sp. Test rotahan, turgid, subglobose ; chambers numerous,
       ventricose ; terminal chamber especially large and inflated.

I. obliqua, n. sp. Test inequilateral, compressed, formed of long curved
        chambers, coiled irregularly on an oblique axis ; septation indefinite
       terminal chamber investing one-half of the shell.

/. suhrotunda, n. sp. Test subspherical, formed by the acervuline growth
       of minute chamberlets on a central disk.

    In addition to these, two other more obscure varieties have been met with,
requiring further investigation. One of these, provisionally named /. vermi-

formis, resembles /. cylindroides, but has a test of uneven diameter and
irregular twisted contour, suggesting an uncoiled spiral with rudimentary
septa. The other, /. macella, has a large complanate nautiloid test, the
chambers marked by depressions, the septation very indistinct.
          ON THE RAINFALL IN THE BRITISH ISLES.  383

Report of the Rainfall Committee for the year 1868-69, consisting of
   C. Brooke, F.R.S. {Chairman), J. Glaisher, F.R.S., Prof. Phillips,

  F.R.S., J. F. Bateman, C.E., F.R.S. , R. W. Mylne, C.E., F.R.S.,

   T. Hawksley, C.E., Prof. Adams, F.R.S., C. Tomlinson, F.R.S.,

   Prof. Sylvester, F.R.S., and G. J. Symons, Secretary.

The attention of the Rainfall Committee has during the past year been

largely devoted to various arrangements and details calculated to secure in-

creased uniformity and accuracy amongst their observers ; a very consider-

able number of stations have been visited during the past year by our Secre-

tary, and the observers have been further instructed on any points in which

their practice -was incorrect ; besides which the following code of rules has

--Abeen drawn up for their guidance.
I. Site.  rain-gauge should not be set on a slope or terrace, but on a

--level piece of ground, at a distance from shrubs, trees, waUs, and buildiugs
   at the very least, as many feet from their base as they are in height. Tall-

growing flowers, vegetables, and bushes must be kept away from the gauge.

If a thoroughly clear site cannot be obtained, shelter is most endurable fi-om

--N. W., N., and E., less so from S., S.E., and W., and not at all from S.W. or jST.E,
   II. Old Gauges. Old established gauges should not be moved nor their

registration discontinued until at least two years after a new one has been

in operation, otherwise the continuity of the register will be irreparably de-

--stroyed. Both the old and the new ones must be registered at the same time.
   III. Level. The funnel of a rain-gauge must be set quite level, and so

firmly fixed that it will remain so in spite of any gale of wind or ordinary

circumstance.

 --IV. Height. The funnel of gauges newly placed should be 1 foot above

grass.

 --V. Rust. If the funnel of a japanned gauge becomes so oxidized as to

retain the rain in its pores, or threatens to become rusty, it should have a

coat of gas-tar or japan black.

 --VI. Flo.\.t Gauges. If the measuring-rod is detached from the float, it

should never be left in the gauge. If it is attached to the float, it should

be pegged or tied down, and only allowed to rise to its proper position at the

time of reading. To allow for the weight of the float and rod, these gauges

are generally so constructed as to show only when a small amount of
water is left in them. Care must always be taken to set the rod to the zero

or 0.

 --VII. Can- and Bottle-Gauges. The measuring-glass should always be

held upright ; the reading is to be taken midway between the two apparent

surfaces of the water.

 --VIII. Time of Reading. Nine a.m. daily ; if only taken monthly, then

9 A.M. on 1st.

  --IX. Date of Entr?. The amount measured at 9 a.m. on any day is to

be set against the previous one, because the amount registered at 9 a.m. of,
say, 17th contains the fall during 15 hours of the 16th, and only 9 hours of

the 17th. {This rule, aiyproved of hy the Meteorological Societies of Enqland
and Scotland, cannot be altered, and is particularly commended to the notice of

observers.)

 --X. Mode of Entry. If less than one-tenth (-10) has fallen, the cipher

must always be prefixed ; thus, if the measure is full up to the seventh line,

it must be entered as -07, that is, no inches, no tenths and seven hundredths.
                                                                                                                    ;

--884 REPORT 1869.

For the sake of clearness, it lias been found necessary to lay down an inva-

riable rule that there shall always be two figures to the right of the decimal

point. If there be only one figure, as in the case of one-tenth of an inch

(usually written ·!), a cipher must be added, making it "10. Neglect of this

rule causes much inconvenience. All columns should be cast up tivice.

--When there is no rain, a line should be drawn rather than ciphers inserted.
   XI. Caution. The amount should always be written down before the

water is thrown away.

 --XII. Small Quantities. The unit of measurement being -01, observers

whose gauges are sufficiently delicate to show less than that, are, if the

amount is under -00.5, to throw it away; if it is "005 to -010 inclusive, they

are to enter it as "01.

XIII. Every observer should train some one as an assistant ; but where

this is not possible, instructions should be given that the gauge should be

emptied at 9 a.m. on the 1st of the month, and the water bottled, labelled,

--and tightly corked, to await the observer's return.
   XIV. Heavy Eains. ^When very heavy rains occur, it is desirable to

measure  immediately     on  their  termination                                                   and  it  wUl  be     found  a  safe  plan,
                                                                                               ;

after measuring to return the water to the gauge, so that the morning regis-

tration will not be interfered with. Of course if there is the slightest doubt
as to the gauge holding all that falls, it must be emptied, the amount being,

--in accordance with Rule XI., pi-eviously written down.
   XV. Snow. In snow three methods may be adopted it is well to try

them aU. (1) Melt what is caught in the funnel, and                                                                           Fig. 1.
measure that as rain. (2) Select a place where the snow

has not drifted, invert the funnel, and turning it round,

lift and melt what is enclosed. (3) Measure with a rule
the average depth of snow, and take one-twelfth as the

equivalent of water. Some observers use in snowy wea-

ther a cyliuder of the same diameter as the rain-gauge,

and of considerable depth. If the wind is at all rough,

aU the snow is blown out of a flat-funnelled rain-gauge.

   The desirability of more accurate information of the

maximum fall of rain in the minimum time has recently

beeu strongly felt. It wiU be supplied by the use of the

instrument shown in figure 1. Its principle is very sim-

ple, consisting merely in the employment of a collecting

area about twenty times that of the measuring-tube ; an
iuch of rain is therefore expanded to a length of nearly

2 feet, and the rising rain-water in the tube carries on its

surface a small white glass baU which renders the reading

of the gauge visible from a considerable distance ; an
overflow pipe is also provided, by which the measurement

is continued up to 2 inches.

In the year 1863 Mr. Symons read a short paper before

the Mathematical Section of this Association, at the New-

castle-upon-Tyne Meeting, wherein he briefly notified the

inauguration of the now weU-known Calne rain-gauge experiments. The

observations having been stopped in the year 1868, in consequence of the re-

moval of Colonel Ward from Calne, considerable attention has been given to

the discussion of the very voluminous record sheets. Those connected with
the A-ariation in the amount of raiu collected at various heights above the

grouud are in the hands of the Rev. J. M. Du Port, M.A., for examination.

          Our last Report contained particulars of the remarkable accuracy of tlie whole

f of the instruments ; in the present we give the amounts collected by all the

          gauges in the magnitude series during the five years, an analysis thereof, and
          the results obtained at Calne, and an interim note on those indicated at
           Strathfield Turgis Rectory, Reading, to which, as explained in our last Report,

           the gauges were removed in the spring of 1868.
              Table I. contains the monthly amounts for the whole period. Table II. is

          an abstract of the same ; Table III. gives the ratio of the fall collected by
           each gauge to that collected by the gauge 12 inches in diameter, Table IV. is

           an abstract of the same.

5-8 per cent., the largest quantity being recorded by those gauges which were

most easily managed, viz. those 5, 6, and 8 inches in diameter.
    (3) That at Strathfield Turgis the agreement has been still closer, all but

the 1 inch and the 24 inch agreeing within 1-5 per cent.
   This last result might partly have been anticipated from two causes,

(a) Colonel Ward's health appears to have compelled him frequently to em-
ploy a substitute, and (6) Mr. Grithth commenced with the preliminary dif-
ficiilties removed, and information as to possible sources of inaccuracy which
previous experimentalists had had to discover by continuous observation.

   Considering the absence of auy trustworthy published observations upon
the subject until those under notice were commenced, the lengthy articles
published upon it in some of the scientific journals, and the almost universal
ignorance upon it which recently prevailed, it is by no means an unimportant
matter to have brought to a definite issue. Moreover, considering the various

sizes of the gauges used simultaneously in different parts of the country, it
is especially satisfactory to find that, instead of ha\ing, as was anticipated, a

correction to apply to the observed values, when measured by a gauge of any
but a standard size, to convert them into the equivalent indications of that

standard size, no such correction is necessary ; for all the most usual sizes,

5, 6, 8, and 12 inches diameter, agree within 1| per cent.
   It seems probable that the smaU quantity registered by the 1-inch gauge

--is solely due to the great difficulty of emptjdng the last drop by no means

an unimportant matter with so diminutive a gauge, for a single grain weight
of water corresponds to 0-008 inch, or nearly one ton of water per acre.
The excess collected by the gauge 24 inches in diameter is probably ex-
plained by the influence of the large mass of metal of which it is composed
for after nights of heavy dew it generally contains more than any other, and

this would naturally result from its greater radiating-power.
   Some slight alterations were made at Strathfield Tur-

gis, on January 1, 1869; and with their conclusion on

January 1, 1870, the investigation there of the question
of the influence of magnitude will probably be termi-

nated.

The results of the examination of rain-gauges during

the year are given in exactly the same form as in the

last Eeport, and we are not aware that they call for any

comment beyond referring, for explanation, to our Report

for 1867, p. 466, and the plate there given. Gauge

No. 278 being unlike any of those previously engraved,

Awe add the annexed sketch, fig. 2.  is a funnel 4 inches

in diameter, B a divided glass tube into which the rain

passes. F a stout post, the upper part of which is hol-

lowed out at C, half the outer portion, D, being hinged

Eto afford access to the glass ; is a pad to keep B close

up to A.

It wiU be noticed that the errors of some of the

larger float gauges are not given in detail, the testing

apparatus not being adapted to them.

It has been the practice of the Committee in their

various Beports to adopt, for convenience of comparison,

a decennial grouping of returns, such as 1840-49,

1850-59, &c. We are now on the eve of completing

one of these decennial periods, and it behoves us there-

fore to consider how we may best secure for the ensuing period the attainment
of the objects for which we were originally appointed. One of these is ex-

--pressed in the first grant in the following words : " For the purpose of

constructing and transmitting rain-gauges to districts where observations are

not at present made."

   Even to those least acquainted with the subject, it will be apparent how
much more desirable, as well as easy, it is to compare simultaneous obser-
vations than those wherein both the observed values and their times
are different. Your Committee have therefore felt it to be their duty to
examine how far the existing stations adequately represent the true rainfall
of the British Isles. The result shows that their number and distribution,
though incomparably superior to that which existed when your Committee

were appointed some years since, is still capable of great improvement
tracts of land the rainfall of which as water-supply for towns is of high im-

portance are without adequate observations, while other places are, if pos-

sible, too well provided.

    To take Devonshire as an example ; excepting two gauges at the Con^dct
Prison, one on the northern edge at Chagford, and one on the south at Lee
Moor Clay Works, Dartmoor (that wettest of Devonshire districts) has no re-
presentative, Exmoor has none at all, and there is no gauge between Torquay
and Plymouth. On the other hand, Sidmouth has four or five observers, and
Exeter an equal number.

    Similar cases of imequal representation occur in various parts, and should
be removed. The Tj'neside Naturalists' Club are about to establish a series

of gauges along the Cheviots, the Cardiff Xaturalists' Society are doing the
same iu South Wales, and other instances could be quoted.

   We have already shown that there is a special reason for endeavouring to

equalize the representation during the ensuing autumn, so that the new
observers whom we hope to obtain may have a few months' practice before
the commencement of the decennial period 1870-79.

   We hope that the landed proprietors of Great Britain and Ireland are be-

coming sufficiently aware of the importance of rainfall statistics in engineer-

ing and draining operations to see their own advantage in helping us by
having observations regularly made by careful persons under their own

supervision. There are, however, some districts for which your Committee
will have not only to provide the instruments but also to pay some small

fee to the observers. To meet this special charge we have to ask for a special

grant, in addition to the small ordinary one required for current expenses in
the examination of gauges and other kindred matters.

   Sheweth, That your Memorialists respectfully solicit Your Grace's atten-

tion to a subject of great importance in the construction of artificial rivers for

irrigation and drainage.

That at a Meeting of the British Association in August last at N^orwich, a

paper was read by Mr. Login, one of your Memorialists, on the abrading and

transporting power of water, in which he laid before the Association the

results of his experience in India regarding the power of flowing water for

holding solid matter in suspension.

   The subject was considered to be of so much practical importance, that
your Memorialists were appointed a Committee to report ujion it to the Me-

chanical Section of the British Association ; but they have found the present
state of scientific knowledge to be so vague and imperfect that it is in their

judgment necessary to obtain, in the first instance, a complete series of

experimental data.

To institute experiments would, however, require some expenditure for

apparatus and attendance beyond the means of the Association.

Moreover, since the results of the investigations Avould, in the oj^inion of

your Memoriahsts, be of great public utilitj', they venture, indcpcndentl)' of

the Association and solely in their individual capacities, to lay this matter
before Tour Grace in the hope that the Indian Department of Her Majesty's

Government will take the subject matter of this Memorial into their considera-

tion, and if deemed expedient dii'ect that the requisite investigation may be

undertaken at the public expense.

extent and variety of the subjects to be reported on, and the very recent

date of the trial of implements by the Royal Agricultural Society, and by

the Highland Agricultural Society of Scotland, on the resxilts of which trials

the Report must to a great extent be based, it has been found impossible to

mittee consider it advisable to defer publishing it until it can be inchided in

a general Report, especially as some important trials of reapers have been

made since it was written.

Your Committee beg leave to represent that, if reappointed, they are

confident of being able in due time to present a satisfactoiy Report to the

 Report on the Physiological Action of the Methyl and Allied Series.

           By Benjamin W. Richardson, M.A., M.D., F.R.S.

In introducing the present Report to the Association, I would, as preliminary

to new matter of research, record that the siibstance known as bichloride of
methylene (the properties of which I was led to study as a part of the work
entrusted to me in previous years) has, during the past twelve months,
increased very greatly in practical importance. The bichloride has been used

for general anaesthesia on a large scale in Guy's, the London, Charing

Cross, Ophthalmic, and Samaritan Hospitals. It has also been largely em-
ployed for the same purpose in the provinces of England. In Prance its
action has been carefully studied, and one of the graduation theses at Stras-
bourg has been devoted to the subject of its action. In Italy the bichloride
has made its waj', and in Germany it is employed by the distinguished Von
Graefe (who learned its application from Dr. Taylor of Nottingham), and by

several other eminent surgeons.
   Respecting the action of the bichloride of methylene and its advantages

over other anaesthetics as j-ct discovered and rendered applicable, I have re-

--ceived special rejjorts from the following gentlemen : Peter Marshall, Esq.,

Administrator at the Charing Cross Hospital, Dr. Junker, Administrator at
the Samaritan Free Hospital, J. Rendle, Esq., Administrator at Guy's,.!. Adams,
Esq., of the London Hospital, J. Bader, Esq., Ophthalmic Surgeon at Guy's, Dr.

Taylor, Surgeon to the Ophthalmic Hospital of Nottingham, and Mr. Wood of

Erighton.

   I am happy to add that up to this date (August) no accident has occurred in

the administration of the bichloride. I have never held that it is free from
danger, and Ireported in regard to it, at first, that it could not be considered as the
safest agent of its kind until it had been administered twenty thousand times

"with a totality of less than ten deaths as the result. I hope, however, now
that it may even go safely through this very severe ordeal ; for at the lowest

estimate it has been administered 4500 times in England alone without
a fatal catastrophe. In the experience which has sprung from the adminis-
tration of this anaesthetic, one very interesting and valuable practical truth has
come forth, viz. that with skill on the part of the administrator the most rapid
and safest insensibility can be induced with a quantity not exceeding sixty
minims ; thus for small operations, or, I had better said, short operations,
such as tooth-extraction, operation for cataract, &c., the required anaesthesia
--406 REPOET 1869.

can be induced in from twenty to forty seconds, with perfect recovery in from
three to five minutes. The mode of administering, in order to produce these
effects, is simple : the inhaler I showed last year is modified by being

lengthened, and the fluid is not introduced as spray, but is poured directly
into the inhaler. The inhaler itself is made of leather, and is lined with
loose demette ; it is jjerforated at the end furthest removed from the mouth,
so as to admit air. For this modificatiou of inhaler, and for demonstrating

the extremely rapid action of the bichloride with it on the human subject, we

are indebted to Mr. Rendle. The method has been successfully employed

now in four hundi'ed operations. I may be pardoned for dwelling on this

practical fact for one reason alone ; for this reason, that it shows the true

value of a correct theory in estimating the properties of chemical substances
on living animal bodies, based on the physical characters, purely, of the sub-

stances themselves. From the chemical composition of the bichloride of

methylene, from its boiling-point, and the density of its vapour, I was able
to claim for it its probable place as an anesthetic before it was subjected
to the test of experience, and especially to claim for it that its power to take
effect would be as rapidly developed as would be the recovery from it when
it was withdrawn. The practice has proved the theory to have been in this

case safely founded ; and the fact may be accepted as an encouragement to all
who are or may be striving to reduce oiu- knowledge of the action of

medicinal agents to fixed principles. For my part I am certain (and I think

the after pages of this Report will help to prove the idea) the day is at

hand when the mere chemical and physical characters of any substance being
known to the physiologist, he wUl be able to foresee clearly what are the
physiological values of the substance, and to calculate the symptoms and
changes it will induce in the animal economy from pure theoretical formulas
and with perfect precision.

                                                  Methtlal.

The substance methylal, C3 fl, 0.,, to which I called attention last year,

deserves another brief word. I confirm what I said concerning it last year,

viz. that it is a slowly acting anaesthetic, producing by its inhalation a sleep

which is very deep and prolonged. I would add to this Report that methylal

may be taken internally in the same proportion as common ether (it could be

used also in the form of hypodermic injection), and that, as it is soluble in

water, it promises to be a very valuable addition to our list of anodyne

remedies. During the past months Liebreich of Berlin has brought out the

Hsubstance chloral (C^ CI3 0) as a body which possesses the power of inducing

long-continued sleep. I have not yet been able to obtain chloral for ex-

periment *.  PLAN OF NEW RESEARCHES.

  In the new researches to which I have devoted my attention since last

Meeting, I have aimed, while studying the action of several compounds which
have not previously been considered by the physiologist, to bring the present
work, together with the past, into sj'stematic arrangement, to group under
their proper chemical heads the agents submitted to inquiry, and to ascertain
whether any distinctive physiological characteristics could be discovered as
connected with distinct chemical series of organic bodies. I commenced,

therefore, by placing before myself a set of Tables which I now put before the

   * After the reading of this Report Dr. Richardson was supplied, at Exeter, with a spe-

cimen of chloral by Daniel Hanbury, Esq. He was thus enabled, at the request of the

Section, to bring up a supplementary report on chloral during the Meeting.

Section. I have grouped in these Tables certain representatives of different
series in their natural place and in five divisions, viz. nitrites, hydrides,
alcohols, chloi'ides, and iodides. Under each division the two first represen-
tatives of the series are tabled, and the fourth and fifth. The propylic com-
pounds, which would form the third representatives, are omitted in every case,
owing to the difficulty of obtaining perfectly reliable specimens. The sub-

stances named in italics have been considered in previous Eeports.

408 REPORT--1869.

    As it soon became apparent that, under all forms of administration, the
results were mateiiaRy modified by temperature, care was taken to secure,
in analogous experiments, the same ranges of temperature. This was efifected
by means of specially constructed chambers, into which the air could be ad-
mitted in measured quantities, and in which the air or atmosphere could be
maintained for any length of time at a nearly fixed degree, the variations at
the extremest being imder three degrees in Fahrenheit's scale. (The chamber
was defined in a diagram. In it the air could be raised to 120^ Fahr. and
sustained at that heat, or reduced to 10° below freezing-point and kept at that
low temperature steadily.)

    Another chamber was also used in experiments where inhalation of an
atmosphere charged with a foreign gas or vapour was not wanted ; this con-

sisted of a simple metal chamber with a double hning, through which warm

or cold air could be passed at pleasure. Within it was slung a cradle lined
with thick felt, made after the manner of a hammock. In this chamber the
air could be readily raised to a temperature of 160°, or even 200° Fabr. ; but
the chamber was not air-tight, and was not adapted for holding in circuit
atmospheres of common air mixed with vapours or gases. It was always
well ventilated vrith pui'e air, and was used for inducing recovery, or for
proving the conditions adverse or favourable to recoveiy from certain of the
agents employed when they were administered in excess.

    The classes of animals subjected to the vapours or fluids were batra-
chians, birds, small herbivorous and carnivorous mammals. In every in-
stance where comparative inquiilcs were made the utmost care was taken to
estimate mere apparent difi"erences of phenomena from the same agent from

differences in the character or constitution of the animal submitted to the

action of the agent. The natural temperatures of all the warm-blooded
animals was recorded from time to time, and the mean temperature was cal-
culated and adopted as the natural standard.

   Advantage was taken of difi'erent seasons of the year, and of extreme
natural variations of heat and cold, for the carrying on of many of the in-
qiiiries. This point of practice, followed out at first without reference to any
other than the present research, was found to have a distinct and important
bearing on the general question of the use and administration of chemical

medicinal agents.

   I now pass to the first part of this Report, taking up the study of the

groups of substances in the order of the Tables.

                       PART I.--THE NITRITE SERIES.

    In previous Reports I have called the attention of the Section to the action
of the nitrites of methyl, ethyl, and amyl. I have experimcuted during the
past year with the nitrite of butyl, and have thus completed the elementary
study of the group up to the amyl or pentylic series. The specimen of nitrite

of butyl I used was made for me by Professor Wanklyn. It is obtained by

the action of nitrous acid upon butylic alcohol.
    Xitrite of butyl is a slightly coloured fluid, having an odour like nitrite of

amyl, but it is not so overpowering. Its physiological action is nearly the
same as that of nitrite of amyl, but less iuteuse and protracted ; it quickens
the pulse, produces suffusion of the countenance, causes great oppression on
the brain, and those singular noises or sounds in the head which resemble

the sounds produced by the rusluug of water. The breathing also is affected,
and the respiratory muscles are influenced as after running sharply until out
of breath. In a case where a young friend of mine (who has naturally a
rnVSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF THE METHYL AND ALLIED SERIES. 409

very hard and quick pulse) inhaled the nitrite, I "noticed, during the time

when the face was suffused, that the pulse, which previously had been beating
at 80 per minute, did not rise to more than 86 beats, but became much

relaxed and even feeble, regaining its tone within a few seconds after the
agent was withdrawn. For practical purposes, the nitrite of butyl presents

to me no advantages over the nitrite of amyl, and it has the disadvantage that

it is more easily decomposed.

Geneeal Review of the Nitrites in eesaed to Physiological Actios".

With these observations on nitrite of butyl we may, I think, consider that the

physiological properties of the nitrites is, in an elementary sense at least,

understood. They all present a beautiful unity of action, varied only in in-

creasing force and persistency of action as the weight of each rejiresentative

in the series increases with and from increase of carbon. The summary of

their action is briefly as follows : they act instantaneously on the nervous

system of organic life, reducing the power or force of that system, and re-

ducing, as a result, the vascular tension ; thus they cause relaxation of

extreme vessels, and that suffusion of blood which is the most prominent

visible sign of their effect ; thus they cause intense action of the heart,

followed by quickened respiration, due to the liberation of the heart from

the tension to which it is normally subject ; thus, administered internally,

they cause (and this is specially the case with niti"ite of ethyl or nitric

ether) free secretion of organs, such as the kidneys, which are under the

control of the organic nervous centres.

Acting in the manner thus stated on the vascular tension, they produce an

action on the voluntary muscles and on the brain, leading to paralysis of

muscular and mental power, when carried to extremity. But this paralysis

is in every sense a secondary action of the nitrites ; they produce no anaes-
thesia showing primary action in the cerebral organs ; they cause no con-
vulsion of the voluntary muscles showing primary action on the cerebrum,

cerebellum, or spinal cord. Unconsciousness and muscular prostration, when

they follow, are due to destruction of organic nervous control over the vessels

which supply the great nervous centres witli blood ; and the fiual general
prostration is syncope, syncope as pure as that emotional syncope which

awaits fear or intense anger, or the equivalent of these, sudden loss or re-

moval of blood from the centres of volitional power.

   I hope I do not seem to press these facts unduly ; for in reality, when the

whole question is seen by the experimental physiologist, it cannot be too

strongly urged. In the organic nitrites we hold in our hands a series of che-

mical agents Avhich exert an influence over a specific set of organs in animal

bodies, and over those organs in one specific way. Further, these agents,

against our wills, act through precisely the same means and in precisely the
same manner as do the more obscure, because more refined, inlluences which

excite daily in us what we call emotions. An act which shall call forth a

blush, an act which shall call forth the pallor of terror, an act which shall

--produce involuntary secretion, an act which shall make the heart beat with

an intensity that is painfully felt, all and any of these acts, which would be

called psychical, have their precise physical analogues in the actions of the

organic nitrites. In this study the physiologist meets the psychologist on

common ground ; his facts as to effects from the physical ca\;se are as sure
as are facts from the effects of mental causes ; but how either the phj'sical or
the psychical impression is made remains yet to be discovered. It may in either

case be an immediate impression conveyed by the nervous expanses of the

1869.                                    2E
410 REPORT--1869.

senses direct to the organic nervous sj^mpathetic cbain. It may be in either

case an indirect impression convej'ed from within the body, and, as one -would

imagine by the blood, to that nervous chain. But why the nervous chain

shoukl thereupon lose its controlling power, what molecular change is com-

Wemunicated to it to make it lose its power, we cannot answer at present.

must be content to wait, satisfied for the moment with the possession of a truth

which fifty years ago the most sanguine physiologist would not have dreamed

of, that there is a class of organic bodies by which we are able to induce,

in a simple physical way, what have been called up to this time emotional

phenomena.  '

One other observation deserves a moment's expression, inasmuch as it

explains a well-known symptom which many persons have experienced.

If the heart be thrown into sudden action by any external cause, by breath-

ing, for example, the vapour of nitrite of amyl, there is produced in the head

a peculiar pulsating burring sound, which sometimes amounts to a whistle or

coo. In some forms of disease, especially in debility following upon emotional

distress or anxiety, this sound becomes persistent and intensely distressing.

In both cases the sound is produced by the same cause. The vascular ten-

sion reduced at those points of the body where the vessels pass through

rigid canals or openings, there is vibration set up in the resistant parts,

which vibration produces audible sound. In the entrance of the internal

carotid artery into the skuU by the carotid canal, we have a perfect arrange-

ment for the production of this pulsating murmur ; and as the canal is in close
and solid connexion with the organ of hearing, the murmur is clearly and

often painfully audible whenever the artery (if I may use the expression) is

not under guard, i. e. is not under the full control of the organic nervous

power,

             THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF HYDRIDES.

   The first of the hydrides named in the Table, and the last, have been

--studied in regard to their physiological action and values.
   Hydride of Methyl or Protylen. This body, known commonly as fire-
damp in mines, and as marsh-gas on laud, is made by heating together

acetate of soda, caustic potassa, and well-dried lime. Its properties and
composition will be seen in the Table. I have already (at Dundee) reported
on the action of this hydride and have little to add to what was there
recorded. To make it produce rapid auicsthcsia the gas must be inhaled nearly
undiluted Math air. It produces no excitement, and recovery from its effects,

if the inhalation be stopped in time, is extremely rapid : a few seconds are,
indeed, sufficient to restore consciousness and muscular power. The gas can
only kill by a process of gradual negation of respii'ation, by replacing air re-
quired for the oxidation of the blood. It has no irritating properties, and is
breathed without causing spasm. I repeat here what I was able to state at
Dundee, that death from fire-damp must be of the easiest kind, must in fact
be as easy as going to sleep, a circumstance which accounts probably for the
sleep-like placidity and posture in which the dead have been found after fatal
accidents from inhaling this substance. From the circumstance that the hydride
is found in the air of marshes, it has been taxed as the cause of malarious fevers.

--There is no evidence whatever to support this view no evidence whatever

that the gas is anything more than an immediate and simply negative poison,
the effects of which cease so soon as the animal body has been removed from
its influence. It is certainly possible that a person exposed for several hours
to the gas mixed ^^·ith air would be reduced in power, and would suffer from
                                                                          ;

reduction of temperature ; but from this he would recover, if there were no
other conditions acting injuriouslj- at the same time. It is fair, therefore, to

assume that in the atmosphere which generates malarial fever, the hj-diile is
only a coincident with the true cause of fever, and that either dampness or
the presence of some other organic poison is at work to jn'oduce the more

serious and persistent consequences of exposure to marsh-air.

   Hydride of methyl in the pure state might be used as nitrous oxide is
often used, viz. to produce insensibility to pain by gaseous suffocation ; but

--the principle of the method is rude and unworthy of science.
   Hydride of Amyl. Hydride of amyl may be made by adding iodide of amyl

=to water with zinc, and applying heat at 288° F. ( 142|° C.) for some hours.

On distillation a fluid comes over composed of amyleue and the hydride ; the

mixture is left in contact with caustic potassa for twenty-four hours, and is
then rectified from a water-bath at 35° C. The distillate is immersed in a
freezing-mixture, and treated witli anhydrous and fuming sulphuric acid,

which retains the amylene, and the hydride is distilled over. This, which is

Franldand's process, is described in full in Watts's Chemical Dictionary

but to get by this plan any sufficient quantity of fluid for a series of physio-

logical researches vs'ould bo practically out of the question. Fortunately the

hydride forms one of the parts of American petroleum, and from a specimen

of this petroleum Dr. Yersmann has been able to distil for me a sufficient

myquantity of the fluid for  purposes.  The specimen presents all the cha-

racteristics of the hydride ; the specific gravity is 0-G2.5, and it boils at

86° F. (=30° C). As a fluid it is colourless and odourless ; it is very agreeable

to breathe, and creates no irritation. There is a specimen before the Section.

  A distillation from petroleum, having all the properties of hydride of amyl,

was tried in America about two years ago as a general anaesthetic, and was

reported on favourably. I therefore subjected the hydride to careful experi-

ment, and foiind it to be truly a general anaesthetic that might admit of

practical application. In order to produce decided effects, 40 per cent, of the

vapoiar of the hydride must be present in the inspired air ; and so volatile is

the fluid that constant repetition of it is necessary, unless it be placed in a
receiver admitting very little air. Administered by inhalation to pigeons, in

sufficient quantity to produce determinate insensibilitj', the period required

for the pi'oduction of symptoms was found to be under a minute, and the in-

sensibility to be profound in a period a little less than two minutes. The
insensibility in the bird is attended with some convulsive movement and

dra-wing back of the head. Eecovery from the eflfects of the hydride is

rapid, not so rapid as in the case of the hydride of methyl, but still rapid, the

animal regaining its full consciousness and muscular power within two

minutes. The temperature of the body remains nearly unchanged. The

inclination is towards a reduction of temperature, but it does not exceed the

fourth of a degree on Fahrenheit's scale. The blood undergoes no obvious

change.

To observe the extreme effects of the hydride, animals, after they had be-

come insensible, were allowed to sleep into death. The process of death is

gentle, and the respiration and circulation cease nearly simultaneously, the

respiration failing a little first. The temperature of the body falls during the

last few minutes of life from 1° to ] |° of Fahrenheit's scale. The pupil

dilates. After death the heart is found well charged with blood on both

sides, and the organ on exposure to the air starts into vigorous action. The

blood on the left side is darkened in colour, but the coagulation is natural, and

the corpuscles are uninfluenced. The lungs, as is common when both sides of

                                                                   2e2
412 iiEPOKT-- 18G9.

the heart are left full of blood, are natural in colour ; thej- are not blanched,

as after chloroform, nor congested, as after ether. The brain is natural.
The muscular irritability is long retained.

    To put the hydride to further test, I inhaled the vapour of it myself from a
Vulcanite inhaler, such as I employ for bichloride of methylene : the vapour
was very agreeable to breathe, caused no cough and no irritation, but a sen-
sation as of a gentle warmth or glow in the chest. After six inspirations I felt
evidences of change in the cerebral circulation, giddiness, and inability to
stand, with the common swaying movement, or sense of movement, which
marks the first degree of anaesthetic sleep. In a little time T lost conscious-
ness for a few moments ; but the inhaler being removed I quickly recovered,
and in three minutes was perfectly well. Neither nausea, nor headache, nor

chilliness followed.

    Owing to the low boiUug-point of this hydride, it admits of being employed
by the physiologist for many inquiries bearing on the restoration of animal
life after some forms of death. Thus, after destroying in frogs, by the action
of extreme cold, those functions or acts which constitute what is called life,
the process of recovery is best determined by regulating the slow restoration
or return of heat, and by preventing a suddenness of reaction which ordinarily
is fatal. Now, by immersiijg the animal in the hydride of amyl, and then
warming, there is no danger of warming too quickly, as the fluid boils at 86°
Fahr. ; neither is there any necessity for removing the animal until, by the

escape of a bubble of gas from the mouth, the first indications of restoring
respiration are afforded ; then the animal removed will, in most cases, re-
cover in the op3n air. I have seen the frog recover after immersion under
this hydride for a period of seven minutes.

   Ou the whole, I am of opinion that pure hydride of amyl might, if it were

needed, be employed as a general anaesthetic, and that, for short operations
especially, it would be effective. I do not, however, put it above the other
anaesthetics, but would rather assign to it the same position as belongs to
ethylic ether, amylene, and nitrous oxide gas.

    I must not, however, pass over some other minor but, in the aggregate,

important uses of this agent. At a very moderate cost now, a hydride may

be obtained which, though not absolutely answering to its pure chemical
character, is sufficiently pure for the purposes I shall name, and which must,

when the value of it is made known, ensure, I think, its employment by all

practitioners of the healing art. I will notice some of its applications in
detail, but by no means all of them.

   From the fact that tlie hydride boUs at a temperature twelve degrees below
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          .

the natural temperature of the human body, it is very useful as a fluid for

producing, in form of spray, rapid local insensibility. In most persons it
produces insensibility, in this manner, in a period of from one to two
seconds, and for mere punctures or slight incisions it answers well ; but for
larger essays it is too volatile, and does not cover a sufficient surface. It is
advisable, therefore, to dilute it with absolute ether, by which means the
best compound that can be employed for producing rapid local insensibility is

secured.

    The hydride of amyl dissolves some juices and fats with great facility.
Camphor and spermaceti dissolve in it freely, and the vegetable and animal

oils mix wth it. Advantage may be taken of these properties for making a

solution I have placed before the Section, and which is most valuable for re-
lieving the pain of burns. The solution is made by saturating the hydride
with spermaceti, then adding camphor until that ceases to dissolve, and finally

mixing the compound which lias been produced with an equal quantity of
olive-oil. "When this solution is applied on wool, over a burned surface, the

cold produced bj^ the evaporation of the hydride gives instant relief ; while
the thin layer of fatty substance left behind effectually excludes the air, aud
forms a false pellicle or skin, which greatly promotes cure.

   Iodine dissolves readily in the hydride, as is seen in another solution which

is before us. The solution thus formed is the best of all solutions of iodine,
for a variety of purposes ; when the solution is applied to the skin, the hydride
psses away at once, and the iodine is left in a thin and even layer. The solu-

tion is also useful for deodorizing; for this purpose pieces of cloth maybe satu-
rated in it, and when the iodine is deposited on the fabric it may be suspended
in the ail', when the iodine is quickly diffused mechanicallj^ but evenly, through
the air. Iodine inhalation, weak solutions of the compound being used, may

be readily and elegantly applied by means of this compound.
   If strong solution of ammonia be well shaken with hydride of amyl, and

then allo^^'ed to stand, small bubbles of gas are steadily evolved, and after a

time the hydride containing a large quantity of ammonia may be decanted

off; this ammoniated hydride is au excellent antiseptic, aud can be nsed with

advantage by the anatomist for the preservation of animal structures in the
fresh state in a closed jar. The same solution charged with camphor can be

used by the student of natural history as a preservative of his specimens.

Lastly, the ammoniated hydride can be applied medicinally by inhalation in
cases where the physician wishes to administer ammonia rapidly, as in
scarlet fever and in states of gxeat prostration. The ammonia can be so

diluted in this manner as to be rendered agreeable for inhalation.
   I could enumerate other uses of the hydride of amyl, but must pass them

by with the further remark that, so soon as its value is known and appre-
ciated, it must become as common an agent in medicine as ammonia, or ether,

or alcohol.

             Eeview of the Hydrides.

   Reviewing the action of the class of hydrides up to the hydride of amyl,

we may consider each body of the scries to be, in a physiological sense, nega-

tive in character. Yery stable as chemical compounds, practically insoluble
in the blood, boiling at a lower temperature than the living body, producing
no irritation, they inflict no injur}- on the living economy unless they are in-
haled in such quantities as to exclude air. Then they produce, like amylene,
a temporary insensibility, their power in this respect increasing with the
increase of the carbon in the series ; but, owing to the insohibility of the
agents in the blood, the insensibility is in all cases of very brief duration,
and would quickly be a fatal insensibility if, by continuous administration, it
were prolonged.

                            THE ALCOHOL SERIES.

             Methylio Alcohol.

   At the Meeting at Dundee I reported at length on the action of methylic
alcohol. I have now to add to the Report then made respecting it some
observations in relation to its influence on the animal temperatui'e. In its

effects, in this particular, methylic alcohol resembles chloroform, but in a

more striking degree. In birds (pigeons) I found, when the third degree of

intoxication was produced, that in so short a period as ten minutes the tem-
perature was reduced four degrees Fahr., and that the decline of tempera-
ture continued during the whole period of recovery, reaching at the lowest a
decline of eight degrees on Fahrenheit's scale. The temperature begins to
--414 REPORT 1869.

rise about two hours after the first indications of rccovcrj^ ; but a period of
from seven to eight hours is required to restore tlic body, even under favour-
able conditions, to the natural temperature. In one case these effects of

reduction of temperature were observed when the external temperature of the

aii'was80°rahr, (26fC.).
                                              EtHYLIC AlCOHOL.

   Much research has been made of late years on the physiological action of
ethylic or common alcohol, much controversy has followed research, and

points unsettled are too numerous to mention. Peeling it quite impossible

to enter into one point of controversy without involving myself in many
others, I determined simply to make one or two new and independent in-
quiries, and to place on record the results. What I have done relates to the

influence exerted by alcohol on animal temperature, the condition of the
organs of the body during extreme alcoholic intoxication, and the mode of
death when the poison is carried to the fatal degree.

    On the particular points of temperature, I have to record that in the pro-

 gressive stages of alcoholic intoxication, the tendency in all cases is to a de-
 crease of animal heat. In the progress towards complete intoxication under
 alcohol, however administered, there are, as under chloroform, four distinct

 degrees or stages. The first is a stage of simple exhilaration, the second of
 excitement, the third of rambling insensibility, and the fourth of entire
 unconsciousness, with muscular prostration. The duration of these stages
 can be modified in the most remarkable manner by the mode of administra-
 tion ; but whether they are developed and recovered from in an hour or a
 day, they are always present except in cases where the quantity of alcohol
 administered is in such excess that life is endangered or instantly destroyed.
 In the first or exhilarative stage the temperature undergoes a slight increase ;
 in birds a degree Fahrenheit, in mammals half a degree. ^Vith the stage of

 excitement, in the second stage, during whicli there is vomiting in birds, or
 attempts at vomiting, the temperature comes back to its natural standard and
 soon begins to fall ; and during the third and into the fourth degree the decline

 continues. In the fourth degree the temperature falls to its first minimum,
 and in birds comes down from five and a half to six degrees ; in rabbits from
 two and a half to three degrees. In this condition the animal temperature

  often remains until there are signs of recovery, viz. conscious or semicon-

 scious movements, upon which there may be a second fall of temperature

  of two or even three degrees in birds. In this course of recovery I have seen,
 for instance, the temperature of a pigeon which had a natural standard of
  110° reduced to 102°. Usually with this depression of force there is desire

 for sleep, and with perfect rest in a warm air there is return of animal heat;

  but the return is very slow, the space of time required to bring back the
  natural lieat being from three to four times longer than that which was re-
  quired to reduce it to the minimum.

      In these fluctuations of temperature the ordinary influences of the ex-
  ternal air play an important part as regards duration of fluctuations, and to
  some extent as regards extremes of fluctuation.

      The introduction of alcohol into the body in frequent and small quan-
  tities, so as not to produce any of the stages of true intoxication, is attended
  with a reduction of temperature limited to one and a half degree in small
  mammalia. The eff'ect is definite on the administration, and occurs under

 --varying circumstances before food, after food, and in atmospheres of different

  warmths. It is most definite when the alcohol is administered by the hypo-

  dermic method.
     PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF THE METHYL AND ALLIED SERIES. 415

   When the alcoholic sleep from ethylic alcohol is pushed to the fullest extent,

a very long time elapses after perfect imconsciousness is clevclopcd before the
respiratory, circulatory, aud even some of the voluntary muscles cease to act.

The movement of the voluntary muscles is not, however, by an act of consci-
ousness ; it is not reflex, and it cannot be excited by the touch. It is usually
an automatic movement, aud will continue in the limbs for a long time. At

last nothing remains to give evidence of the continuance of life except the
motion of the heart and diaphragm, the persistency of the action of which is

amongst the most curious facts in physiology. The final act rests with the
heart ; the heart continues to contract when the breathing has ceased, aud
is found contracting on the right side in both auricles and ventricles, on
opening the body, when all the outward indications of motion are over.

   I notice particularly that prolonged tremors do not seem to be produced by

ethylic alcohol.

   The appearances immediately after death from ethylic alcohol intoxica-
tion are very distinctive. The brain is found charged with fluid blood, the

sinuses distended with exudation of serum in the ventricles and in the mem-

branes. The small vessels of the brain are greatly injected. The lungs are
Avhite, free from congestion, and well inflated with air. The heart is full of
blood on both sides, and its air-vessels are engorged. The liver is natural,
and the gall-bladder is not distended. The inner surface of the stomach,
even when the intoxication is induced by the gradual inhalation of the vapour
or by subcutaneous injection, is very much congested, and a strong odour of
the alcohol pervades auy contents that may be within the stomach. The
spleen is normal, and the alimentary tract below the stomach is normal. The
kidneys are intensely congested, blood exuding freely from the cortical part,
in points or specks. The bladder is usually empty. The blood on the left,
as well as on the right side of the heart, is dark, but on exposure to air it
soon reddens, and coagulation is firm. The corpuscles undergo great changes,
even before death ; they are shrunken, crenate, and some are elongated and
flattened, with truncated ends.

                                               BuTTLic Alcohol.

    Butyllc alcohol, obtained by fractional distillation from fusel-oil, or from
the oil of beet-root, or from molasses left after distillation of ethylic alcohol,
differs, as our Table shows, from ethylic alcohol in the proportion of carbon

and hydrogen. Compared with common alcohol, its vapour-density is as '37 to

23, its specific gravity is as -803 to -792, and its boiling-point is as 230° P.
to 172°. It is a hea^de^ alcohol : it mixes indifferently with water, but is

not unpleasant to take when diluted and sweetened. Apphed to the lips and
tongue in the pure state, it burns more than ethylic alcohol, and it leaves
 a very peculiar and prolonged local numbness, not unlike the numbness left
by tincture of aconite. The knowledge of this fact may prove of service in

 the application of the alcohols for the local relief of pain.

    The physiological action of butylic alcohol is that of ethylic alcohol exerted
in a slower and more marked degree, and with some symptoms added. The
 period required for producing intoxication is full double that required by
the ordinary spirit, and the time required for recovery is longer still. The
variations of temperature run parallel with those which we have seen imder
 ethylic alcohol, and indeed, with the exception of time, there is a complete
parallelism up to the third degree of intoxication and the stage of recovery.
In the third degree, after the temperature is depressed to the minimum of
that degree, distinct tremors of the muscles appear. They come on at
--416 REPORT 18G9.

regular intervals spontaneously ; but the}' can bo excited by a touch at any
time, and in the intervals, when thej' are absent, there is frequent twitcliing
of muscles. The tremors themselves are not positivclj- muscular contrac-
tions, but are rather vibrations through the whole muscular system, and are
connected with extreme want of true contractile power. While they are pre-

sent the temperature declines, and a difference of a fiiU half degree may be
observed both before and after each paroxysm. When the tremors are once
established, they may continue without furtlicr administration of alcohol for

ten and twelve hours steadily ; and so slowly do they decline, that I have seen
them occurring in the pigeon thirty-six hours after the intoxication. They
subside by remission of intensity and prolongation of interval of occurrence.

    There cannot, I think, be a doubt that these tremors, produced in animals

by the heavier alcohol, are identical with the tremors observed in the human
subject during the alcoholic disease known as delirium tremens. "What the
nature of the muscular movement is, what unnatural relationships exist between

the nervoiis sj^stem, the muscles, and the blood to cause them, these are ques-
tions of singular interest. Involuntary, developed even against the will, ex-
cited by any external touch that sets up prostration, attended with great
reduction of temperature, and remaining so long as the temperature is low,
they indicate clearly an intense depression of animal force, a condition in which
all the force that remains seems to be expended on the organic acts of life,
on the support of the motions of the heart, the muscles of respiration, and the
functions of the secerning glands. The voluntary systems of nerve and muscle
are indeed well nigh dead, and recovery rests entirely on the maintenance of

the organic nervous jiower.
    In the extreme stage of intoxication from butylic alcohol the arterial

blood loses its red colour, and the blood, which flows with ditRculty from
veins, is of dirty hue. Coagulation occurs readily, but the clot is loose, and

yields much coloured serum. The corpuscles are closely massed togetlier in
roUs, several appearing as if they made oue distinct column. Tho iibrine
separates in masses or bands, forming a coarse network or mesh very di-

stinctive in character.

Amylic Alcohol.

I have already reported, at the Birmingham Meeting of the Association,

myon amylic alcohol. In its etfects, as a reference to  Report will show, it

differs only from butylic alcoliol in that the symptoms are even more pro-

longed. The tremors are most persistent, and complete recoverj% as indicated

by rcstoi'ation of the natural temperature, is not often attained in a shorter

interval than three days. At the same time, owing probably to the compara-

tive insolubility of this alcohol by the blood, it is very difficult to destroy life

with it b}^ simple gradual administration. When to the ordinary observer

recovery seems impossible, when there is perfect insensibility, Avhen there is

perfect paralysis of voluntary muscle, when even tremors cannot be excited,

and when the only evidence of life is a feeble respiration at intervals of

many seconds, recovery may be made certain.

                                    Review of the Alcohols,

   Reviewing the alcohols as a class, we find that their physiological action,
less extended in regard to particular organs than the nitrites, and more ex-

tended than the insoluble hydrides, is expressed both on the organic and
cerebro-spinal centres, reducing the active functions of both systems, and
at last so reducing the function of the cerebral hemispheres as to remove coQ'
                                                                                                                  ;

seiousness altogether. The leading peciiliarity of the action is the slowness

with which those centres which suj)ply the heart and diaphragm with power

are affected. In this lies the comparative safety of alcohol ; acting evcnlj' and

slowly, the different systems of organs fall together, with the exception of

the two on which the continuance of mere animal life depends. But for this

every deeply intoxicated man would die.

The alcohols arc strictly anaesthetics ; and indeed the first published case

of surgical operation under anaesthetic sleep was performed, in 1S39, by Dr.

Collier on a person who was rendered insensible by breathing the fumes of

alcohol.  But  the  anaesthesia  is  not  commendable                                                             it is too slow and too
                                                                                                               ;

prolonged. Methylic alcohol, if it could bo entirely purified and made inodo-

rous, might be used, and with methylic ether it would be one of the safest of

agents ; but as yet its inhalation is disagreeable.

The difference of action of the alcohols, as they ascend in the series and as

the carbon increases, is most striking. The slowness of action, the prolonga-

tion of action step by step, from the lighter to the heavier compounds, is a

fact as definite as any in physiology. Curious is it also that neither

the methylic nor the ethylie alcohols produce those tremors in the inferior

animals which we recognize and speciallj- name from their occuiTence in
man ; while the butylic and the amylic most effectively call them forth.
Considering how much of the heavier alcohols is distributed for consumption,

especially among the lower orders, I think it is possible that the heavier
fluids may also be the cause of delirium tremens in the human subject, as they

are frequently the cause of that continued coldness, lassitude, and depression

which follow the well-known dinner Avith " bad wine."

Speaking honestly, I cannot, by any argument yet presented to me, admit the

alcohols through anj' gate that might distinguish them as separate from other

chemical bodies. I can no more accept them as foods than I can chloroform,

or ether, or methylal. That they produce a temporary excitement is true

but as theii- general action is quickly to reduce animal heat, I cannot see

how they can supply animal force. I see clearly how they reduce animal

power, and can show a reason for using them in order to stop physical or

to stupify mental pain ; but that they give strength, ?. e. that they supply

material for construction of fine tissue, or throw force into tissues supplied by

other material, must be an eri'or as solemn as it is widespread.
   The true place of the alcohols is clear; they are agreeable temporary shrouds.

The savage, with the mansions of his soul unfurnislicd, buries his restless

energy under their shadow. The civilized man, overburdened with mental

labour, or with engrossing care, seeks the same shade ; biit it is shade, after
all, in which, in exact proportion as he seeks it, the seeker retires from per-

myfect natural life. To search for force in alcohol is, to                                                        mind, eqiiivalent to

the act of seeking for the sun in subterranean gloom until all is night.
   As yet alcohol, the most commonly summoned of accredited remedies, has

never been properly tested to meet human diseases. I mean by this, that it

has never been tested as alcohol of a given chemical composition, of a given

--purity, and in given measures. Wines, beers, spirits, arc mixtures com-

pounds of alcohols, and compounds of alcohols with ethers and other organic

substances. It is time, therefore, now for the learned to be precise respecting
alcohol, and for the learned to learn the positive meaning of one of their
most potent instruments for good or for evil; whereupon I think they will

place the alcohol series in the position I have placed it, even though their

prejudices in regard to it are, even as mine are, by moderate habit and

confessed inconsistency, in its favour.

                      iiEPOKT 18G9.

                      THE CHLORIDES,

   I have in previous Reports brought forward the properties of the chlorides

of methyl and ethyl. The first is an admirable anesthetic, when inhaled in

the proportion of 15 per cent. : it ranks in safety next to methylic ether, and
a compound made of it with absolute ethylic ether is perfect. The objection

to it is that, being a gas, it is not easily manageable.

    Chloride of ethyl stands in the same position as chloride of methj'l ; but

the action of it is much more prolonged, and a longer time is required for the

production of action. With absolute ether it forms an excellent compound,

the objection to which is, simply, its instability.

   The chlorides of butyl and amyl have an action so mucli alike that they

may be taken together ; both are simple and effective anaesthetics, and both

are pleasant to inhale, the butyl chloride being most agreeable.

The peculiarity of their action is that the sleep they induce is extremely

jjrolonged, this being specially the fact with chloride of amyl. Pigeons when

put to sleep by breathing ten per cent, of chloride of amyl pass slowly through

the three degrees of anassthetic insensibility^' easily and vsithout convulsion,

but invariably with slight vomiting. From ten to twelve minutes of inhala-

tion are required to produce perfect sleep, and the temperature of the body

falls full four degrees. The sleep once produced wiU continue in the common

air at 70° Eahr. for fifteen minutes profoundly. The awakening is quick, and

recovery is perfect.

In rabbits the action is much the same ; seven minutes are required to

produce safe narcotism, and the sleep produced is very profound. The

breathiijg is tranquil, and the eyes, as is the case from amylenc, usually re-

Amain open.  rabbit will lie fivc-and-thirty and even forty minutes in

this state of insensibility before showing signs of recovery, and the tem-

perature win fall from 3° to 4° Eahr. If the inhalation be carried too far,

the profound sleep I have mentioned passes slowly into death, the sleep

being prolonged in the common air at 70° Eahr. a fuU hour and a half prior

to death. During this time tlie respiration for the most part is natural, with

occasional double     breathing but                                                  the temperature of  the body is all the
                                                                                  ;

while gradually declining, and is even reduced, while yet the animal is breath-

ing, to 21° Eahr. below its natural standard. Thus in one case the temperature

of a rabbit fcU from 103° Eahr. to S2° Eahr. This is the lowest reduction I

have seen in connexion with symptoms of living action ; but from this extreme

condition recovery is possi))le if the respiration be sustained in a warm air.

After death from the chloride of amyl the heart- is found charged with

blood on both sides, and the action of the auricles and ventricles is long per-

sistent. The blood is very slow to coagulate ; but the venous and arterial
bloods retain their colour. The lungs are natural. The blood- corpuscles are
much changed ; they are shrunken, steUate, and elongated, with truncated

ends.

The brain is left bloodless and of the purest white.

                                       Note on the CnLOEinES.

    The whole of the substances in the chloride series are simple and pure anaes-
thetics, and the power of their action obviously increases in proportion as there is
increase of cai'1)on. They act most readily and determinately on the cerebrum,
and on the centres of volition and common sensibility. They have little action
on the organic nervous system, and they interfere, even in full doses, but very
gradually ^yitli the movements of tlie heart and respiration. The chlorides

                                  THE IODIDES.

   The action of the iodides of methyl and of amyl have already been reported
on : they both produce insensibility ; the first causing free elimination from
glands, and the second causing tremors resembling those induced by amylie

alcohol.

   The iodide of ethyl resembles the methyl compound closelj" in its action,
but it produces sleep more quickly and with less irritation. The vomiting
produced by it is severe, and its action, if carried to the production of insen-
sibility, is not comfortably safe. It maj' be administered cither by inhalation
with ether or by subcutaneous injection ; it brings down temperature six
degrees in birds. The iodide of hutijl is very slow in its action, and produces
symptoms closely resembling those caused by the amyl iodide, viz. tremors,
and, during recovery from the insensibility, motions, partly voluntary, in a
circle or semicircle, which continue for a long period. The temperature falls
under the influence of this agent from five to six degrees in pigeons, and from
two to three degrees in rabbits. The colour of the blood is much heightened,
the venous appearing as arterial blood, and the coagulation is very slow. The
corpuscles are not injured, and show no disposition to coalesce, llecovery

from the insensibility produced by the butyl iodide is good. The iodide may be

administered by inhalation with ether or methylic alcohol, or bj- subcutaneous
injection ; and it has this advantage, that of all the iodides it shows least dis-
position to undergo change on accidental exposure to the air,

                                         KoTE ON TUE Iodides.

    The substitution of the clement iodine in the organic bodies, marked in our
Table, induces evident difference of physiological action. The action of the
iodine is throughout on glandular structure, an excitation of glandular action
and elimination, the action declining as the quantity of iodine is reduced.
The Avhole of these organic iodides exert an climinatory as well as an anodj-ne
influence, and for this reason thej' promise to be of great service in medicine.
Iodide of butyl will probably be found to be the best of the series.

   To make them applicable as internal remedies, I have studied carefully
the best mode of preparing them, and find the form of syrup by far the most
effective and convenient. )Specimens of syrujjs are before the Section.

                   PART II.--MEANS OF EESTORATIOX.

   The second and concluding part of my Ecport has reference to the all-im-

portant question of the best means of meeting what seem to be fatal accidents
arising from the administration of those agents which are most commonly iu
use. In this direction of research I have had unexampled opportunities of

study, and I regret only that the length of my Report necessitates an undue

brevity on this one particular topic.

 --The substances which commonly produce dangerous symptoms divide them-

selves into two classes, those which produce prolonged intoxication, and
those which produce quick insensibility and immediate death. The alcohols
are illustrations of the first of these series ; the chlorides and ethers, and,
indeed, all the very volatile and gaseous narcotics, are illustrations of the

second.
--420 REPORT 1869.

Respecting the means of recovery from the intoxication by the slowly acting

narcotics, the rnles are extremely few and simjjle : they are two only, and they

include all ; they are («) exposiu-e of the animal to warm air, and (6) in

extremity the steady and efficient maintenance of artificial respiration.

When these rules are rigorously followed, death from the profoundest intoxi-

cation is rare. This remark applies even to those extreme examples where
there are tremors of muscles and all the signs of instant dissolution. The

temperature of the air should be, as a rule, about ten degrees below that of

the natural temperature of the animal. But in intervals of great depression

the temperature may be raised to ten and even twenty degrees above the

degree of temperature natural to the animal.

In regard to recover}' from the extreme and sudden effects of the second

class of substances, moderate warmth of air is again an advantage ; but

sudden extreme warmth is often fatal, from the expansion of gaseous matter

in the lungs. From G0° to 65° Fahr. is the best temperature for recovery

from the more volatile agents.

    In both classes of cases artificial respiration is often all essential ; but it

may be used to kill as well as to save, imless it always be used with a perfect

knowledge of what it is to do.

And this I find to be a rule having no exception, that it is always bad

practice to excite artificial respiration so long as there is anything like a

natural respiration. If the subject be breathing once in ten or even fifteen

seconds, it is best to let well alone. The reason for this rule is simple, and

rests on the fact that the balance of circulatory and respiratory power must

be sustained. In health there is a nicely adjusted balance of pressure be-

tween the blood brought by the action of the right side of the heart to the

lungs to be aei'ated, and the air brought by the muscles of respiration to eifcct

aeration. To resort to any violent means to enforce respiratory movement is

to destroy this delicate balance, to cause rupture of the air-vesicle, and infil-

--tration of air into the surrounding tissue emphysema. In brief, when the

current of blood passing from the right to the left side of the heart is

reduced, as it is in the cases we are treating of, to the extreme of debility,

the i)oiut of practice is to bring back the respiration and the circulation toge-

ther. NVe must treat the body, in a word, as we would a candle or lamp, the

active flame of which is extinguished, but the wiek of which is still burning

without flame. It is also important, in performing this act, not to disturb

the body by any sudden movement, for the least motion, when the circulation

is ebbing, is often sufficient to stop the enfeebled and hesitating heart.

To meet these refinements in the method of restoring animation, I have

invented the simple pocket-bellows which I place before you ; they arc made

of india-rubber, and the bellows part consists of two round balls, which can         I

be grasped by one hand. "When the bellows are compressed, the ball on the

right-hand side yields the air it contains to the long exit-tube, while the

ball on the left hand yields the air it contains directly to the outer atmo-

Whensphere.  the bellows are allowed to till with air, the right ball fills

directly from the pure air, the left from the long exit-tube. AVhen, then,

the long exit-tube is inserted in the nostril, and the beUows are worked

together, one bcUows fills the lungs, during compression, with pure air, the

other empties the lung, during expansion, of impure air. Thus the natural

conditions for breathing are carefully imitated, and the manipulation is

simple to the last degree. In using the bellows I commonly leave one nostril

quite open, putting the tiibe of the bellows firmly into the other. Then I

commence gentle inflation, and continue until such time as the action of
PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF THE METHYL AND ALLIED SERIES. 421

the heart has ceased, and all further attempts are irscless, or until there is

evidence of natural respiration. But when there is once evidence of natural
respiration, I am specially cautious to do no more unless the natural act

should of itself cease, when I repeat as before. In all my experiments I

have never seen the respiration cease after it has been restored, except in one
solitary case, and then the relapse was probaby due to injury due to forcing

the artificial respiration too strongly at first. On the other side I have fre-

quently seen the continuance of artificial respiration, after the establishment

of natural respiration, from the doing too much, destroy effectuall}' the good
which had previously been accomplislied.

    "With this convenient instrument, after cessation of breathing by any

of the narcotic vapours not heavier than chloroform, life seems to me to be

restorable in a large majority of eases, if the respiration be artificially com-
menced within three minutes after its cessation.

CONCLUSION.

myI have thus, Mr. President, brought  labours this year to a close.  Had

time been permitted for further research, I should have entered upon the

study of one or two new series of bodies ; but the laboiir must be held in

reserve.

  We cannot pretend in Reports like these to vie with our more fortunate

brethren in other departments of science. The ph}-siologist has no ground of
pleasant work in common with the astronomer, the geographer, geologist,

ethnologist, or chemist. His researches are hard (unrelenting I had almost

said), excessively minute, laborious, and at all times, however absorbing,

painful ; many of them can, in fact, only be carried on under a sense of duty

amounting to necessity, and with the sincerest, the most solemn feeling that

they are being conducted for the ultimate benefit of all the higher classes of

animal existence. In the preparation of this Eeport I have held on through-

out by this sense of duty, and earnest faith that good must come out of the

laboiu".

   One object which I had directly in view has been to introduce certain new
substances which may be directly apphed in our treatment for the cure of

disease, or for relief of pain ; another object has been to discover the best
means of removing danger, from the use or abuse of some of the more

potent agents ; but the leading idea of the Eeport is that which I brought

--forward at the Bii-mingham Meeting the idea of studying the action of

substances which are to become remedies, not by the old and faulty method
of so-called experience, but by proving physiological action and the relation

of chemical constitution to physiological action. I am certain the time must
soon come when the books we call " Pharmacopoeias " will be everywhere re-
consti'ucted on this basis of thought, and when the chemist and physician
will become one and one. That this huge reform may be commenced by
order of the legislative authorities in this country is to me an earnest hope.

Put whether this shall be the final result or not, I shall always recall, with
satisfaction, the remembrance that the idea of the reform and the first work-
ing of it began in England, and under the auspices of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science.
422 REPORT--1869.

On the Influence of Form considered in relation to the Strength of

   Railway Axles and other portions of Machinery subjected to rapid

  alternations of Strain. By F. o. Bramwell, C.E.

[Plates III. & IV.]

Before the days of railways, wlien uot only was there much less machinery
oil which to found observations, but such machinery as there was was

worked under far lighter strains and with far fewer alternations of those
strains in a given time than the machinery of the present day is subjected
to, the question of the influence of form was not an obtrusive one ; and, in
fact, so long as tlie weakest part of any piece of maclainery, such as a shaft,

had the sectional area due to the efficient resistance of the strains that could
be ascertained as coming upon it, little or no attention -^as paid to the
manner in which this smallest sectional area was to be associated with en-

largements formed for the purposes, in the case of shafts, of receiving wheels

or of acting as collars.

   As an instance of this, few engineers in the pre-railway days would have
hesitated to make a cast-iron crank-shaft for a steam-engine in the manner

shown in fig. 1, Plate III. They would have taken care to give the bearings

A A(or journals as they are called)  such a diameter as was jiidged to be suffi-

cient, having regard to the area of the piston, the pressure, and the length

of stroke ; but they would have made the body part, B, of the shaft and the
end, C, in the eye of the crank of a much larger section than that of the

bearings A A, would probably have made these parts square, and would without
Ahesitation liave formed the junctions of the small parts A mth the large

parts B and C abruptly with right angles, as drawn in fidl lines, and with-

out any attempt to ease off the change in form by a bold curve, as sho-«Ti

by the dotted Hues.
   The square shoulder woiild be left, in order to get a good endway bearing

against tlie sides of the supporting brass ; and few, if anj', engineers in those

A Adays would have imagined that if the bearings  were large enough, the

making the shaft at B and C of a greatly increased section, and the making the

Ajunctions of these sections with the sections by right angles, could in any

Away be prejudicial to the strength of the bearings A. The opinion was

(and, on the face of it, by no means an unreasonable opinion) that if the

Abearings A were strong enough, the fact of any neighbouring part being
Astronger could not in any way detract from the value of A.

   Occasionally, however, there were occurrences which might have aroused

attention, but which, it is believed, were allowed to pass by, being accepted

as mere workshop accidents, and not thought worthy of inquiry by the

skilled engineer of the time ; and still less were they treated as problems to

be solved by scientific men outside the profession of engineering.

    Fig. 2, Plate III., illustrates one of these occui'rences. It shows a form of

eccentric rod commonly then in use. In such a rod the ends A A were made

of long screws to carry nuts to tighten against the lugs of the eccentric

band, as shown dotted at B B ; these ends (A A) were forged in short lengths,

A Asay, from C, and after having been turned at the parts  and screwed, were

welded at C to the body of the rod.

   It was by no means a common thing, but occasionally it did happen, that,

Din the act of making the weld at C, tlie screwed end snapped off at close

to the enlarged part without any blow whatever having been struck upon

the end. It has been said the occurrence was not a common one; but it was

sufficiently well known to experienced smiths to induce a prudent workman

Ato hold up, by grasping it with his leathern apron, the screw while the

weld was being made at C ; and this precaution was generally found suffi-

cient to prevent the fracture.

   When, however, the fracture did occur, it was usually attributed to the
iron having been originally bad, or to its having been injured by the great
amount of local hammering in reducing it from the size of the collar to that
of the screw, or to its haraig been " burnt," or to some other such cause.

   Enough has probably been said to give an idea of the state of engineer-
ing practice and knowledge on this subject of "form" in the pre-railway

times.

   The introduction of railways, however, caused machinery to live a very
fast life, and now subjects an axle in the course of two or three years' work
to the reception of alternating strains and shocks which it would have re-

quired half a centiu'y to inflict upon the crank-shafts of steady-going old-
fashioned engines. On the first establishment of railways the loads were

lighter and the pace was slower than the loads and pace of the present day ; but
more than twenty-five years ago attention was directed to the fact that rail-

way axles, which appeared from their dimensions to be amply strong, were,

nevertheless, frequently broken after one or two years' work ; and accidents
to passengers arose from these breakages, which accidents caused engineers

to consider the subject of the fractures.

Fig. 3, Plate III., exhibits, in a somewhat exaggerated manner, the construc-

A Ation of axle then in use on railways, where  are the bearings or joiirnals,

B B enlarged parts to receive the wheels, and at C C there were left projec-

tions against which the backs of the wheel-bosses abutted. The journals were

made with collars (D D) at their outer ends, and the junctions of these collars

and of the enlarged parts B with the journals were made (as in the case of

the old form of crank-shaft shown in Plate IV.) by right angles.

It was found that axles thus constructed were liable to fracture at the

A Ajunctions of the journals  -with the parts B, and also at the terminations

of the enlarged parts B up against the shoulders C C.

Such a fracture always exhibited evidence of a crack of long standing round

about the axle, which crack had reduced the section of sound metal to but a

fraction (three-fourths to one-half) of the original area. (See fig. 3 a.)

   On one or two occasions instances of these fractures and the consideration of
their causes made the subject of papers brought before the Institution of Civil

Engineers. In the papers so presented (with the exception of Mr. Bankine's,

to be hereafter mentioned), and in the discussions which ensued upon the

reading of those papers, many curious causes, including magnetism and elec-

tricity, were assigned for the fractures ; the prevalent opinion, liowcver,
appeared to be that the iron had been deteriorated by the rapid vibration.

   In 184.3 Mr. Eankine read a paper before the Institution of Civil Engi-
neers, in which he combated the deterioration theory, and attributed the

fractures to the fact of the fibres of the iron not following the outline of the
axle, they having been stopped short at the square shoulder by the turning

down of the journal out of the solid, and to the fact that, on the axle being

subjected to impact, the inertia of the particles on the outside of the enlarged

parts B caused a greater strain upon the outer part of the journals A. Mr.

liankine recommended that the axle should be forged to the shape so as
to ensure the fibre following the outline, and further recommended that the
junction between the two different sizes should be made by a curve.

Mr. Eankine gave instances of the beneficial results obtained with certain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         .·

424 REPORT--1869.

experimental axles thus constructed. This suggestion of Mr. Rankine is

now, so far as i-egards the curvature, always followed by men of skill.
   As a matter of fact, all makers of railway-wheels and axles, and all me-

chanical engineers of experience, now know that, in order to obtain an en-
during axle, it should be made (as shown at Plate III. fig. 4) with bold

hollows at the junctions of the journals with the parts on which the wheels
fit, and with the least possible projection at the back of the wheel-boss and the
formation of a curve at the point of juncture with even this small projection.

   The ordinary railway-waggon or -carriage axle has, from its simplicity,
been used for an illustration ; but it need hardly be said that the cranked
axles (those important parts of locomotives) were found to give way under
similar conditions of abrupt change of form.

   The writer of this paper has the very strongest conviction of the idti-

mately fatal eflfects of these abrupt changes. He has known instances
where, after many years' work in slow-going engines, large shafts have

broken tlirough where changes in the area of section were abruptly made,
although these changes of area were but to a very slight extent. The writer

--is in the habit of introducing into his specifications the following clause :

" Bold hoUows are to be formed in the angles of all the bearings and against
all collars or other projections, on all shafts or axles, and generally through-
out the engine ; care is to be taken that every change of dimension is to be
made gradually."

   Even at the present day, except in the case of those intimately ac-

quainted with the exigencies of railway work, the necessity of attending to

these rules is not always appreciated. As an instance, the writer may mention
that, having directed the swivel-hook of a large crane to be made with bold
hollows, as shown at Plate III. fig. 5, the workman finished it in a man-

ner which he considered " a nice square workman-like job," as shown at
Plate III. fig. 6. The materials were all that could be desired ; but the writer
was compelled to reject tliis hook, because he has not the slightest doubt that,
had it been kept at work, it would very shortly have broken through at the
line xy.

   Having said thus much in relation to that which may be called the history

of the subject, and having brought that history to the point where it is ad-

mitted, by all men of skill in railway work, that, to obtain immunity from

accident, it is not sufficient the weakest part of an axle should be strong
enougli, but care must also be taken that no neighbouring part shall be
abruptly stronger, the writer will endeavour to s<how, in a plain, familiar,

and, he might say, workshop manner, some only, it may be, among many of

the reasons which cause abrupt enlargements to be attended with the disas-

trous effects we now know to accompany them ; and in doing this he will

consider four different propositions.

    1. That abrupt change of form is detrimental even under a quiescent

          load.

    2. That under impact abrupt change of form is detrimental even if the
       object sufiering the impact be supposed to be made of imponderable

         matter.

    3. That, further, under impact abrupt change is still more detrimental
       when the weight and inertia of the object are considered.

    4. That abrupt change is detrimental when the object is subjected to a

         vibratory action.

    As regards the first of these propositions, viz. that abrupt change of form is
 detrimental even under a quiescent load, let Plate IV. fig. 7 represent a
       ON THE INFLUENCE OF FORM ON STRENGTH.            425

suspended bar of uniform sectional area in its body part, and let fig. 8 re-

present another suspended bar of the same sectional area at its lower part as

the bar of fig. 7, but having an increased section at its upper part, such in-
crease being ahvnpthj made ; then, if these two bars be supposed to be sub-

jected to equal loads, there will be more strain at the outside of the smaller

Apart of the bar fig. 8, say at A, than there is on any part of the uniformly

small bar fig. 7.

   Assume that the bars are composed of a number of equally elastic pa-
rallel columns (and to get rid of any question of what may be called the

natural fibre of wrought iron not following the outline of bar fig. 8, let it be

supposed that the bars are made of cast iron or cast steel) ; now if these

elastic columns are capable within certain limits of equal increase of exten-

sion with equal increments of load, it follows that if the bar fig. 7, when
unloaded, were to have a horizontal line drawn across it, as at x y, and the
bar were then to be loaded, the result would be to lower this line to the

position .^' y' , the line still being horizontal.

In fig. 8, however, where the wide upper part contains a greater number

of such elastic columns than its lower part (or than the bar of fig. 7 con-

tains), then if the horizontal line were in the unloaded state of the bar

drawn at x y (the part where the dimensions abruptly change), and if the

load were afterwards applied, xy could not be drawn down so great a dis-

tance as in the case of the bar fig. 7, because there are more elastic columns

on the upper part of the bar fig. 8 to uphold the load than there are in the

bar fig. 7 ; and, moreover, x y could not be drawn down so as to preserve

its straightness, unless it could be assumed that the elastic columns at the

sides of the wide upper part were equally extended with those in the middle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but it is obvious that these outer upper elastic columns, not having any

columns below to pull them, can only be brought down by their lateral con-

nexion with the neighbouring upper elastic columns ; but this connexion being

in itself elastic, the effect can only be to draw the outer parts partially down,

and thus to cause the lowered line x y to assume the curved form of x' y'. Now

it will be seen that this curved form of the line x' \j involves the outer elastic

columns being more extended than the internal columns of the lower part

of the bar ; but as the strain on the elastic columns may be ascertained by

referring to their extension, this proves that the strain is not uniformly distri-

buted, as in the case of the bar fig. 7, and that the outer elastic columns of

the lower part of the bar fig. 8 are more strained than the columns of fig. 7,

and still more strained than the internal columns of fig. 8.

   An endeavour will be made to explain and establish this proposition by
the diagrams figs. 9 & 10. In these diagrams the cross bar B B is taken as

the equivalent of the lateral connexion Avhich exists among the elastic columns

&in the bars figs. 7 8.

AAA,Let fig. 9 represent three spiral springs,      suspended at equal distances

apart, and attached at the bottom to the bar B hinged in the middle, and let

C C C be three other similar spiral springs attached at their upper ends to

Dthe bar B, and at their lower to a perfectly rigid bar carrying the load L.

Under such an arrangement as this the load would be uniformly distri-

buted, and the result would be simply to stretch the springs equally and to

Dlower the jjarts B and  from their original positions indicated by the

Nowdotted lines.   let it be assumed that, as in fig. 10, two other springs,

A' A', each equal to one of the springs A, have been placed alongside of

them and have been attached to the outer ends of the hinged bar B, and

Dthat the load L has been applied to the bottom bar as before ; the result

of sucli a construction would be to pull down the hinged bar B, no longer in
a manner to preserve its horizontality, but to bring it down in a bent form,
and thereby to cause less of the load to be carried by the middle lower
spring C than its fair share of one-third, as carried by the middle spring of
fig. 9, and to throw of necessity this deficiency as an extra burthen upon the

two outer springs C C.
    The writer trusts he has succeeded in making his meaning clear, and has

proved his proposition that, even under a quiescent load, a sudden increase of
 dimension in a suspended bar carrying such a load is a source of weakness.
If the writer has not succeeded in making his meaning clear, he is at a loss

how to illustrate it further, unless it be by some such proposition as this.
Assume 100 men opposed in line to 100 men also in line, then the conflict

would be equal for all; and then assume that one of the contending parties is

increased to 102 men by placing one man on each flank ; the two men will
clearly exert but little influence iipon those who are fighting in the centre of
the lines, but their presence wiU be most injuriously felt by the two flank men
of their opponents, as these two men will each have to contend with two
adversaries in lieu of one. In the same way the internal elastic columns

in the lower part of the bar fig. 8 have only similar fibres to deal with up

above ; but the external fibres of the lower part have not only to deal with

their own proper continuations above, but have also to deal with the fibres

above them in the parts projecting at the sides.
   The second proposition comes now to be considered, namely, the influence

of the abrupt change of form when the force of impact has to be resisted by

the elasticity of an assumed imponderable bar.

   Let D, fig. 11, be a plain bar of uniform section in its body part, but with

an enlargement at the top to enable it to be suspended, and with one at the

bottom to receive a collar, B, on which the weight, W, is supposed to fall

through the distance A B.

   The bar D', fig. 12, is assumed to have in its body part four times the sec-
tional area of D, but to terminate at its bottom end in a short piece E,

having a sectional area equal to D, or one quarter that of the upper part, D'.

AThis bar, D', is also provided with a weight, "\Y, falling through B on to the

collar B'.

   Now let the spring arrangements of figs. 13 & 14 be substituted for the
bars D and D'.

  DIn fig. 13 there is a single spring suspended from a support, and carrying

Wa collar B on which the weight can strike on falling through the distance

AB.

  DIn fig. 14 there arc four suspended springs, D' D' D' D', each equal to of

fig. 13. These springs are siipposed to be united at their lower ends to an

absolutely inflexible bar X, below which is a short single spring E, similar

in area and strength, so far as it goes, to either of the springs D, D'.

  WThis spring, E, supports the collar B', to be struck by the weight on fall-

Aing through the distance A B equal to the B of fig. 13.
Now Wif, as in any of these figs. 11 to 14, the weight
                                                          be suff'ered to fall

Athrough the distance B, the accumulated work residing in it when it

reaches B wiU equal the weight into the distance.

   Let this accumulated work be represented by the parallelogram (fig. 15)

ABAA^W.

   This accumulated work it is intended, in the case of fig. 13, to transfer to
the spring D, by the extension of that spring ; but as the resistance ofi'ered
by the spring will increase directly as the extension of it, the efficacy of the
ON THE INFLUENCE OF FORM ON STRENGTH.  427

spring to receive accumulated work may be represented by the triangle fig. 16,

 where a b represents the extension, and the several horizontal lines represent
the strains due to the different extensions, the strains increasing from at

w" « " to 6 ; and in order that the accumiilated work represented by the

A Wparallelogram B may be transferred to the sirring, its extension must

be such that the area of the triangle a b lu shall equal that of the parallelo-

gram A BW. The maximum strain brought on the spring under these cir-

cumstances Avill clearly be no more than that represented by the length of

the horizontal line b iv.

  A WNow assume that the area of B has to be transferred to the four

springs D' of fig. 14, it is clear that only one-fourth of the area wiU have
to be borne by each spring, and the triangle representing the extension and

strain of each of the springs Avill only have one-fourth of the area of that of

a b IV.

   Let fig. 1 7 represent such a triangle, then, in order that its area may be

one -fourth, it follows that its sides must each be half of those of the tri-

angle a b w, that is, the length of a I, the extension, will be half of « b, and

the length of I m, the final strain, will be half that of b w ; but if this be true
of each of the springs D', the aggregate strain on the four springs must be

double that of the strain on D.

    But this double strain has, in the case of fig. 14, to be put on to the four
springs D' by means of the short single spring E, therefore this spring, which

is equal to D, will be put to a strain twice as much as that put uponD.
   It may be well to remark, in passing, that the fact of the ultimate strains

put on in arresting the accumulated work being double in the ease of fig. 14
to those of fig. 13, although the weight is the same in both cases, is by no
means inconsistent with the fact that when the springs are settled to rest

Wand are supporting as a quiescent load, the sum of the strains of the four

-Springs D' must exactly equal that of the single spring D.

    It has not been thought necessary to take into account the small increase

in the faU of the weight W, due to the lowering of the collars B B' on the ex-

tension of the springs.

    There now comes to be considered the third proposition, that change of
form produces increased strain iinder impact, when the weight and inertia

of the object suffering the impact are taken into account.
    It is quite certain that in practice, where a falling weight is arrested by a

coUar B or B', the accumulated work of that weight would be partly taken up

Dby the elasticity of the bar or D', and would be partly taken up by the

setting of the particles of the bar itself into motion, such motion being
.greatest at the bottom of the bar, and diminishing in the higher parts, until
;at the top of the bar it would become nothing.

   Eeveiting to &figs. 13, 14, 16, 17, let it be assumed, for the sake of

simplicity, and as an illustration only, that all the weight of the apparatus

resides in the collars B B', and that the collar B' of the four-spring arrange-
ment, fig. 14, is four times as heavy as the collar B of the single-spring

arrangement, fig. 13.

  WFurther, reverting to fig. 16, the weight would be brought to rest in the

.time during which it would traverse with a decreasing velocity the height a b,

 and in fig. 17 the weight would be brought to rest in the height al, half of

Wthat of a 6 ; and the time to bring the' weight to rest in this latter case of

fig. 17 would be half that required to bring it to rest in fig. 16.
    Following this out, if the lines a b, a I be divided into the same number

of equal parts, say ten each, then the time to travel over part 1 in fig. 17

                                                                                           2f-2
428 REPORT-- 1869.

must be half that required to travel over part 1 in fig. 16, and the length of

part 1 in fig. 17 must be half that of part 1 in fig. 16.

But the respective collars (B B') must have their weights put into motion

with these velocities, so that the weight B' has to move through half of the

space that B has to move through, and has to do it in half the time ; but to

move a weight through half the space that another weight is moved through,

and in half the time occupied by that other weight, requires double the

pressure ; therefore it would take double the pressure to move B' that it

would to move B, even if B and B' were equal in weight ; but B' is four

times the weight of B, therefore it will take eight times the pressure to

move B' that it will take to move B, and in this case also the eight times

the strain has to be put on by the single spring E, which thus gets eight times

as much strain as the spring D.
   The fourth proposition has now to be considered, namely, that abrupt

change of form is a cause of weakness when vibratory action has to be

endured.

    A.S already stated, this cause is the one that has been most recognized by

those who have touched upon the question.

The writer will not pretend to investigate what the value of this source

of weakness   is, as  no  means  suggest  themselves  to  his  mind  for  doing so
                                                                                                                ;

it may, however, fairly be assumed that the times of vibration in the

large section part of the bar will be different from those in the small, and

that at a point where the change of shape occurs there must be a discord in

the vibrations, and that thus the metal in this part must be exposed to

strains which would not occur were the vibrations on the two sides this point

synchronous.

Propositions 2 and 3 have been dealt with as though the increased strains

brought upon the small sections by their neighbourhood to the large sections

were uniformly distiibutcd over the small sections, which have, for sim-

plicity sake, been assumed to be composed of single springs.

But had these small sections been dealt with as being in themselves com-

posed of several smaller springs, as was done in considering the cases of

figs. 9 and 10, then it would have been found that the outer parts of those

small sections were doing more than their share of the increased work, and

therefore the evils arising from increased section, which have been treated

of in propositions 2 and 3, must be multiplied by the evils due to the abrupt

change of form considered in proposition 1.

The kind of fracture shown in end view in Plate III. fig. 3 a, namely, a frac-

ture which begins all round about the outside and gradually penetrates, is an

abundant practical proof that not only are strains arising from impact in-

creased on part of a small section by the neighbourhood of larger sections

abruptly joining on to the smaller ones, but that the increase is borne in an

undue proportion (as was shown in the case of quiescent weights) by the

outer particles of the small section at the part where they abruptly join on

to the larger section.

   So far this paper has dealt with the e\\\ influence of sudden change of

form when it is to be found in a suspended rod or in other positions where

the influences act in the direction of the length of the object under consider-

ation. In practice, the bolts which hold on armour-plating are instances to
which the foregoing considerations are applicable, us such bolts receive in the

direction of their length the quiescent strain, and also that arising from the

impact of the recoil of the armour-plating after it has been struck by the shot.

   It may be well to al'ude to the fiict that Major Palliser has overcome
                                                                                                             .

the difficulty of the fracturing that took place in the ordinary bolts imme-
diately at the junction of the screw parts with the shank, by diminishing

the area of the shank, so as to be equal to that at the bottom of the thread,
and has thus given in his armour-plate bolts a practical instance that the

strength of parts may be added to by reducing that of their larger neigh-

bours.

   Besides the armour-plating bolts and other bolts, there are no doubt many

cases in which both quiescent strain and the strain of impact are exerted in
the direction of the length of the object ; but there are probably a still larger
number of cases in which the strains are applied transversely, and among
them are the important instances of railway axles.

   It may be well therefore to glance briefly at the influences exercised by a
sudden alteration of form when that alteration occurs in an object exposed

to transverse strain.

    Let fig. 18 represent an elastic bar (A) of uniform section, placed on sup-

ports B B, and subjected to the action of the quiescent load L, the result will

be simply to deflect it as sketched.

   In this deflection the central parts may be assumed to be extended on

the underside, and compressed on the upper, as represented by the con-
verging space abed.

    If, now, the depth of the bar be abruptly increased in the part that lies

between these lines abed and the two ends, as shown in fig. 19, the result
will be to aggravate the strains at the parts a bed in a, similar way to that

which was pointed out in respect of a perpendicularly suspended bar under a
quiescent load. But if the bars have to resist impact, then a more serious
difierence, to the disadvantage of the bar with unequal sections, wHl be
found. It is well known that if one bar be double the depth of another, the
first bar will, under a quiescent load, deflect only one-eighth part of that
which the second would deflect, the deflections being inversely as the cubes

of the depths.

   With respect, however, to the resistance ofiered to the flexure of the bars
under impact and not under quiescent loads, the writer believes it can be
shown that if there be two elastic imponderable bars alike in aU respects
except their depth, and if they be exposed within their elastic limits to the

impact of equal forces, the result will be that, if the one bar be taken as
tmity in depth and as deflecting unity under the force, the other bar, having

V/a                                                                                             -        --

Appljing this formula to the case of a weight let fall upon a bar which is

double the depth of another, the deflection of this bar of double depth will

section of the bar of the double depth wlU be 2-828 times as great as it would

be upon the bar of single depth.

So that if the bars (figs. 18 and 19) be exposed to the impact of similar

forces, the bar fig. 18 would deflect through a space of 2-828 with a strain

of -35 on the central parts, while before the bar fig. 19 could, so far as

the greater part of it (namely its enlarged ends) is concerned, be deflected

through a space of one, there must be put upon the middle section of it,

equal to one only in area, a strain of 2-828. As in the case of the vertical

bars, this extra strain would be aggravated by the fact that it would not
430 REPORT--1869.

be uniformly distributed over the area of one, but would be borne in a

larger proportion by the outside particles, where they join the increased

section.

It will not be necessary to go into the reconsideration, in respect of trans-

verse strains, of the effects of inertia and vibration, which have already been

touched on when considering direct     strains                                but  it wiU be suiRcient to say

that the strains brought upon railway axles are of a very severe character,

and that they are undoubtedly exaggerated by the large difference of dimen-

sions of the neighbouring parts, and that nothing but the greatest circum-

spection in the designing and manufacture of these parts can insure safety

to railway passengers.

On the Penetration of Armour-plates with long Shells of large capa-
  city fired obliquely. By Sir Joseph Whitworth, Bart., C.E.,

   F.R.'S., LL.D., D.C.L.

At the Meeting of the British Association at J^orwich, I contributed a paper to

the Mechanical Section " On the Proper Form of Projectiles for Penetration

through Water." This paper was illustrated by diagrams, showing the effect

produced on an iron plate, immersed in a tank of water, by projectiles with

Hat, hemispherical, and pointed heads. Copies of those diagrams are now

before you. In that paper I claimed for the flat-pointed fomi of projectile,

made of any metal, three points of superiority over the ogival-pointed pro-

--jectiles adopted in the ser'^ice : (1) Its power of penetrating armour-plates,
      when
even        striking  at  extreme  angles                          (2)        its  large    internal  capacity  for
                                                                ;

bursting charges when     constructed  as  a shell                                 (3) its  capability  of passing
                                                                              ;

undeflected through water, and of penetrating iron armour below the water

line. This latter feature was, I think, satisfactorily proved by the experiments

described last year; and I desire to draw the attention of the Section^ to

the experiments I have made for illustrating the penetrative power of long

projectiles with the flat front, fired at extreme angles against iron plates.

These experiments are illustrated by the projectiles actually fired, and the

plates they penetrated, which are laid on the table, and also by the diagrams

before you.

   The gun from Avhich the projectiles were fired is called a 3-pounder, though
capable of firing much heavier projectiles. It weighs 315 lbs., and the maxi-

mum diameter of its bore is 1-85 inch. The charge of powder used, in all

cases, was 10 ounces, and the weight of the 6-diameter projectile is 6 lbs.

    No. 1 is a portion of a plate 2 inches thick, penetrated by the 6-diameter

flat-fronted projectile No. 1 at an angle of 35 degrees. No. 2 is a similar
piece of plate, 1-7 inch thick, completely traversed at an angle of 45 degrees
by the flat-fronted projectile No. 2, which buried itself to a depth of 30 inches
in a backing of iron borings. No. 3 is a piece of plate 1-75 inch thick, pene-
trated at an angle of 65 degrees by the flat-pointed projectile No. 3. No. 4
is a plate 1-7 inch thick, nearly penetrated, at an angle of 45 degrees by the
3^-diameters flat-fronted projectile No. 4. No. 5 is a plate 1| inch thick,,
against which the ogival-pointed projectile No. 5 was fired at angle of 45
degi-ees ; the projectile failed to penetrate the plate, being deflected in con-
sequence of the ])ointed form of the head. The distortion of its shape shows-
the force with which it stnick the plate, and proves the good quality of the-
material which could resist such a test. No. 6 is a plate also 1^ inch thick,

recorded in the paper were made with a gun of smaller calibre, from consi-

derations of economy and convenience ; but I hare always found that what

I could do with the smaller calibres of my system, could be reproduced in the
larger sizes; and from my past experience I feel warranted in asserting that

the effect of penetration now exhibited could be repeated on a proportionate

scale with my 9-inch guns at Shoeburyness, or with the 11 -inch guns my

firm are now engaged in constructing.

  A glance at the formidable nature of the projectiles thrown by these guns,

and a consideration of the effects they may be expected to produce, will show

the importance attaching to the question of penetration of plates by long

projectiles. The 9-inch guns to which I have referred weigh 15 tons each,

Aand are capable of firing powder charges of 50 lbs.  9-inch armour shell,

5 diameters long, weighs 535 lbs., and will contain a bursting-charge of 25 lbs.

I have no hesitation in saying that these projectiles would pierce the side

of a ship, plated with heavy armour, at a distance of 2000 j^ards, and at

some depth below the water-line. The 11-inch guns will weigh 27 tons, and

wiU be capable of firing 90 lb. powder-charges. The 11-inch shells, 5 dia-

meters long, will weigh 965 lbs., and will contain bursting-charges of 45 lbs.,

and would pierce the side of the ship ' Hercules,' plated with 9-inch armour,

at a distance of 2000 yards.

   Were it not that the increased destructiveness of war must tend to shorten
its duration and diminish its frequency (thus saving human life) the inven-

tion of such projectiles could hardly be justified ; but believing in the really

pacific influences of the most powerful means of defence, I call these long
projectiles the " anti-war " shell. The principle I have always insisted upon,

and laid down for my own guidance in artillery experiments (when either a

low trajectory or penetration is required), is, " that every gun should be in

strength capable of withstanding the largest charge of powder that can be

profitably consumed in its bore." I have dravm up the accompanying Table

of the sizes of the bores of my guns, with their proportionate powder-charges,

and the guns wiU all be fully equal to this duty, and I believe the greatest

possible effect from the consumption of a given quantity of powder will be

obtaiaed. But the guns adopted in our naval service are not equal to such

a test ; nor, as I believe, are they so proportioned as to realize the best effect

from the quantity of powder they consume.

Four guns of 12-inches bore have lately been put on board the ' Monarch.'

They weigh 25 tons each, and charges of 50 lbs. and 67 lbs. have been fired

from them with projectiles of 600 lbs. weight. I have no doubt that these

guns have been made with all possible care, and are as strong as their mate-

rial and construction admits ; but if the weight of these guns was in propor-

tion to the capacity of their bore, and if the material were the best that our

metallurgical skill could supply for such a purpose, they ought to fire 117 lbs.

of powder, and projectiles of 1250 lbs. weight. They would then be eflicient

weapons ; but at present they are more formidable in name than in reality.

  We are often flattered by being told that we have the best guns in the

world. That may or may not be the case. But I think that we should not

best contented while we are still so far from having attained as much as our

present advancement in mechanical and metallurgical science has rendered

possible for us.

thickness as to give the coil a time of vibration such that it completes a period

in about thirteen seconds. The upper end of the suspending wire is attached

to a milled head, and this head can be turned round by the fingers. The lower

end of the wire is firmly fixed to the coil, and is in metallic connexion with

one end of it. To the other end of the coil is soldered a spiral of very fine

platinum wire which hangs directly below the coil, and its lower end is

cemented to the dry woodwork of the instrument. To the fixed end of the

spiral coil a copper wire is attached, whose other end is soldered to a bind-

ing-screw in an accessible position.

On one side of the small or moveable coil is fixed a plane mirror, and in

front of the mirror, at a distance of about 450 centims., the scale is fixed on

Awhich the observations are read.     pai'affin-lamp wire, to give dark line in

image of flame, and lens are used in the ordinary way for finding accurately

the angle through which the coil turns. It is never greater than "OS, Its

true amount can be determined to within -jL per cent.

 --The connexions are not very intricate, and are traced thus : Starting

from one pole of the battery (the battery used was sixty sawdust Daniell's

in series), the current goes in at one end of large coil No. 1, and from the

other end of No. 1 the current goes to either end of the moveable coil, and

the end of the moveable coil at which we suppose the current to be comingo

out is connected with the end of No. 2 large coU, similar to the end of No. 1,

to which the battery was first attached, that is to say, the end which will

make the current go round in the same direction in both the large coUs.

When the current leaves the extreme end of No. 2, it passes though a 10,000

B.A. resistance-box ; the current is completed by connecting the other end

of the resistance-box with the pole of the battery not already engaged.

The absolute electrometer is used in the ordinary way for measuring dif-

ferences of potential, and its electrodes are connected, one to the end of the.

dynamometer coil No. 1, which is joined to the battery, and the other elec-

trode is fixed to the end of the resistance-box, which is connected to the

other pole of the battery. Thus the greatest diff'erence of potential in the

arrangement is measured by the absolute electrometer. An electrometer

key is used to reverse these connexions in the course of the experiments.

There is only one other part of the arrangement to be explained, and that

is the method of observing the resistance of the dynamometer coils while the

experiments are going on. This was done by means of the resistance-box in

the circuit and an electrometer. At one time the standard electrometer was

used for this purpose, biit more lately the quadrant, rendered unsensitive,

was employed. Both these instruments are described in the last Report.

To take the resistance of the coils, the electrodes of the electrometer were

first i^laced on the extreme ends of the three coils, and the difference of po-

tential was ascertained. The electrodes were then shifted to the ends of the

resistance-box, and the difference of potentials of its two ends was found.

This gives at once the resistance of the coils.

There are two things which have to be done before the experiments are

commenced. One is the determination of the moment of inertia of the

moveable coil. This is done at the beginning and end of a long series of

experiments, by comparing it with a ring whose moment of inertia is known.

The other is done every day, and it is finding the time of vibration of the

small coil after all the connexions have been made, and the coil put into its
place. This was done both with the current from the battery flowing

through the coils and with no current flowing ; but this variation was of

very little conseqiience, as no difference could be detected in the time. When
43() REPORT--1869.

the dynamometer is set up, care is taken to neutralize the effects of the

earth's magnetism by a large number of magnets fixed at a great distance
from the coils. If the adjustment of the magnets is perfect, there is no
alteration of the position of the spot of light when the current is reversed

through the coils by the battery-key. Up to the present time (May 1868)

various causes have prevented the obtainment of as satisfactory results as the

method described above allows us to expect. Eleven sets of experiments,

made at various dates, from March 10 to May 8 of the present year, have in-
dicated values for v, of which the greatest was 292x10% the smallest
275-4x10'*, and the mean 282-5x10" centimetres per second. Sir W.

Thomson intends to continue the investigation, hoping to attain much greater

Experiments on the Value of v, the Hatio of the Electromagnetic to the Elec-

                trostatic Unit of Electricity. By J. Clekk Maxwell.

   The experiments consisted in observing the equilibrium between the elec-
trostatic attraction of two disks, at a certain difference of potential, and the
electromagnetic repulsion of two coils traversed by a certain current. For
this purpose one of the disks, with one of the coils at its back, was attached
to one arm of a torsion-balance, while the other, with the other coil at its
back, was capable of being moved to various distances from the suspended
disk by a micrometer screw. Another coil, traversed by the same current
in the opposite direction, was attached to the other arm of the torsion-
balance, so as to do away with the effect of terrestrial magnetism.

   The fixed disk was larger than the suspended disk, and the latter, when

in its zero position, had its surface in the same plane as that of a "guard-

ring," as in Sir W. Thomson's electrometers. Its position and motion were

observed by means of a microscope, directed to a graduated glass scale, con-

nected with the disk. When the microscope was adjusted so that the

image of the zero line on the glass scale coincided with the cross wires of the
microscope, the very smallest motion of the scale could be easily detected,
so that the observations were very rapid. The disk was brought to zero by
the tangent screw at the top of the suspension-wire, and its equilibrium was

always observed at zero. The equilibrium, when the electrical forces were
applied, was always unstable. This electrical balance was made by Mr.

Mr. C. Hockin undertook the observation of the galvanometer, and tlic test-
ing of the galvanometer, the resistances, and the micrometer-screw.

   A small Grove's battery was employed to send a current through the three

coils and the secondary coil of the galvanometer Gr^.
    Equilibrium of the electric balance was obtained by working the micro-

meter, and so adjusting the distance of the disks. At the same time equili-
brium of the galvanometer was obtained by altering the resistance of the
 shunt S.

    The simultaneous values of the micrometer and the shunt formed the result
of each experiment. It was necessary also to ascertain the ratio of the mag-
.netic effects of the two coils of the galvanometer immediately after each set

 qf experiments.

    The method of experimenting appeared capable of considerable accuracy

      :;

but some difficulties arose from want of constancy in the batteries, from
leakage of electricity, &c., so that many of the experiments were known to
be faulty. Twelve experiments, however, against which nothing could be
proved at the time of making them, in which the distance of the disks
ranged from | to | an inch, and the power of the batteiy from 1000 to
2600 cells, gave values of v of which the least was 2S"4, and the greatest
29-4 Ohms; and in nine of these the values lay between 28-68 and 28"91.
The mean of the 12 Avas

                    = 179,000 statute miles per second.

   This result is much low-er than that of MM. Weber and Kohlrausch,

=which was i' 310,740,000 metres per second, but agrees, I believe, more

nearly with values recently obtained by Sir W. Thomson, whose method, as

well as mine, depends on the B.A. unit. Weber's method depends on the
measure of capacity. It is to be hoped that this important physical quan-
 tity ma)^ soon be determined by methods founded on capacity, and disem-
barrassed from the phenomena of " electric absoi-ption," whicli occurs in all
solid condensers, and which would tend to give too high values of v.

--Ladies and Gentlemen,

  A few days ago I noticed in a shop window the photograph of a Royal mother

and child, which seemed to me a very beautiful group ; on scanning it more closely, I
discovered that the faces were ordinary, or, at all events, not much above the average,

and that the charm arose entirely from the natural action and expression of the

mother stooping over and kissing her child which she held in her lap ; and I re-
marked to myself that the homeliest featm-es would become beautiful when lit up

by the rays of the soul^ike the sun "gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy."

By analogy, the thought struck me that if a man would speak naturally and as he felt

on any subject of his predilection, he might hope to awaken a sympathetic interest

in the minds of his hearers and, in illustration of this, I remembered witnessing
                                                                                                                                                          ;

how the writer of a well-known article in the ' Quarterly Review ' so magnetized

his audience at the Royal Institution by his evident enthusiasm that, when the lec-
ture was over and the applause had subsided, some ladies came up to me and im-

plored me to tell them what they should do to get up the Talmud ; for that was what

the lecture had been about.

   Now, as I believe that even Mathematics are not much more repugnant than

the Talmud to the common apprehension of mankind, and I really love my subject,

I shall not quite despair of rousing and retaining your attention for a short time

if I proceed to read (as, for greater assurance against breaking down, I shall beg

jour permission to do) from the pages I hold in my hand.

I find myself in the position of one about to address this numerous and dis-

tinguished assembly. When informed that the Council of the British Association

had it in contemplation to recommend me to the General Committee to fill the

office of President of the Mathematical and Physical Section, the intimation was

accompanied witli the tranquilizing assiu-ance that it would rest with myself to

deliver or withhold an address as I might think fit, and that I should be only

following in the footsteps of many of the most distinguished of my predecessors

were I to resolve on the latter course.

  Until the last few days I had made up my mind to avail myself of this option,

by proceeding at once to the business before us without troubling you to listen to

any address, swayed thereto partly by a consciousness of the very limited extent of my

oratorical powers, partly by a disinclination, in the midst of various pressing pri-

vate and official occupations, to undertake a kind of work new to one more used

to thinking than to speaking (to making mathematics than to talking about them),

and partly and more especially by a feeling of my inadequacy to satisfy the expecta-

tions that would be raised in the minds of those who had enjoyed the privilege of

hearing or reading the allocution (which fills me with admiration and dismay) of
my gifted predecessor, Dr. Tyndall, a man in whom eloquence and philosophy
seem to be inborn, whom Science and Poetry woo with an equal spell*, and

whose ideas have a faculty of arranging themselves in forms of order and beauty

as spontaneously and unfailingly as those crystalline solutions from which, in a

striking passage of his address, he drew so vivid and instructive an illustration.

From this lotos-eater's dream of fancied security and repose I was rudely

awakened by receiving from the Editor of an old-established journal in this city a

note containing a polite but peremptory request that I shoidd, at my earliest con-

venience, favour him with a " copy oi' the address I proposed to deliver at the

forthcoming Meeting."      myTo this invitation,  first impulse was to respond very

much in the same way as did the " Needy knife-grinder " of the ' Antijacobin,'

when summoned to recoimt the stoiy of his vn-ongs to his republican sympa-

thizer, " Story, God bless you, I have none to tell, Sir ! " " Address, Mr. Editor,

I hav-e none to deliver."

I have found, however, that increase of appetite still grows with what it feeds

on, that those who were present at the opening of the Section last year, and
enjoyed my friend Dr. Tyndall's melodious utterances, woidd consider them-

selves somewhat ill-treated if they were sent away quite empty on the present oc-

casion, and that, failing an address, the Members would feel very much like the

guests at a wedding-breakfast where no one was willing or able to propose the health

of the bride and bridegroom.

Yielding, therefore, to these considerations and to the advice of some officially

connected with the Association, to whose opinions I feel bound to defer, and

unwilling also to countenance by my example the too prevailing opinion that

mathematical pursuits unfit a person for the discharge of the common d uties of

life and cut him ofl' from the exercise of Man's highest prerogative, " discourse

--of reason and facidty of speech divine," rather, I say, tlian favour the notion

that we Algebraists (who regard each other as the flower and salt of the earth) are a

set of mere calculating-machines endowed with organs of locomotion, or, at best,

a sort of poor visionary dumb creatures only capable of communicating by signs and

symbols with the outer world, I have resolved to take heart of grace and to say a

few words, which I hope to render, if not interesting, at least intelligible, on a

subiect to which the larger part of my life has been devoted.

"f he President of the Association, Prof. Stokes, is so eminent alike as a mathe-

matician and physicist, and so distinguished for accuracy and extent of erudition

and research, that I felt assured I might safely assume he would, in his Address to

the Association at large, take an exhaustive survey, and render a complete ac-

coimt of the recent progress and present condition and prospects of Mathematical

and Physical Science. This consideration narrowed very much and brought almost

to a point the ground available for me to occupy in this Section ; and as I cannot

but be aware that it is as a cultivator of pure mathematics (the subject in which

Bockh, the director of the philological seminary at Berlin, by the zeal and talent lie dis-
played for philology, and only at the end of two years' study at the University, and after a
severe mental struggle, was able to make his final choice in favour of mathematics. The

relation between these two sciences is not perliaps so remote as may at first sight appears,
and indeed it has often struck me that metamorphosis runs like a golden thread through
the most diverse branches of modern intellectual culture, and forms a natural link of
connexion between subjects in their aims so unlike as Grammar, Ethnology, Eatioual

Mythology, Chemistry, Botany, Comparative Anatomy, Physiology, Physics, Algebra,

Music, all of which, under the modern point of view, may be regarded as Iiaving morphology
for their common centre. Even singing, I have been told, the advanced German theorists

regard as being strictly a development of recitative, and infer therefrom that no essentially
new melodic themes can be invented until a social cataclysm, or the civilization of some
at present barbaric races, shall have created new necessities of expression and called into
activity new forms of impassioned declamation.

observations I shall venture to make on the natm'e of that province of the human

reason and its title to the esteem and veneration with which through countless

ages it has been and, so long as Man respects the intellectual part of his nature,

must ever continue to be regarded!.
   It is said of a great party leader and orator in the House of Lords that, when

lately requested to make a speech at some religious or charitable (at all events a

non-political) meeting, lie declined to do so on the ground that he could not speak

--unless he saw an adversary' before him somebody to attack or reply to. In

obedience to a somewhat similar combative instinct, I set to myself the task of
considering certain recent utterances of a most distinguished member of this Asso-

ciation, one whom I no less respect for his honesty and public spirit than I admire

for his genius and eloquence J, but from whose opinions on a subject which he has
not studied I feel constrained to differ. Gcithe has said

                                   " Verstiindige Leute kannst dti irren seliii

  I have no doubt that had my distinguished friend, the probable President-elect

of the next Meeting of the Association, applied his uncommon powers of reasoning,

induction, comparison, observation, and invention to the study of mathematical

science, he would have become as great a mathematician as he is now a biologist

indeed he has given public evidence of his ability to grapple with the practical side

of certain mathematical questions ; but he has not made a study of mathematical
science as such, and the eminence of his position and the weight justly attaching
to his name render it only the more imperative that any assertions proceeding from

such a quarter, wliich may appear to me erroneous, or so expressed as to be con-

ducive to error, should not remain unchallenged or be passed over in silence §.

   He says " mathematical training is almost purely deductive. The mathematician

starts with a few simple propositions, the proof of which is so obvious that they
are called self-evident, and the rest of his work consists of subtle deductions from
them. The teaching of languages, at any rate as ordinarily practised, is of the

--same general nature authority and tradition furnish the data, and the mental

operations are deductive." It would seem from the above somewhat singularly

maticus, purus asiniis." On the other hand, I once heard the great Richard Owen say,

when we were opposite neighbours in Lincoln's-Inn Fields (doves nestling among hawks),

that he would like to see Homo Mathcmaficus constituted into a distinct subclass, thereby

mysuggesting to  mind sensation, perception, reflection, abstraction, as the successive stages

history of the progress of Mathematics and Physics ; Dr. Tyndall's address \vas virtually

tion of the nature of Mathematical Science in the abstract. What is wanting (like a fourth

sphere resting on three others in contact) to build up tlie Ideal Pyramid is a discourse on

the Relation of the two branches (Mathematic and Physics) to, their action and reaction

juxtaposed paragrraplis that, according to Prof. Huxley, the business of the mathe-

matical student is from a limited number of propositions (bottled up and labelled

ready for future use) to deduce any required result by a process of the same

general nature a? a student of language employs in declining and conjugating his

--nouns and verbs that to make out a mathematical proposition and to construe or

parse a sentence are ec|uivalent or identical mental operations. Such an opinion

scarcely seems to need serious refutation. The passage is taken from an article

--in * Macmillau's Magazine ' for June last, entitled " Scientific Education Xotes of

an After-dinner Speech," and I cannot but think would have been couched in more

guarded terms bj^ my distinguished friend had his speech been made before dinner

instead of after.

The notion that mathematical truth rests on the nan'ow basis of a limited

number of elementary propositions from which all others are to be derived by a

process of logical inference and verbal deduction, has been stated still more strongly

and explicitly by the same eminent writer in an article of even date with the pre-

ceding in the ' Fortnightly Review,' where we are told that " Mathematics is that
study which knows nothing of observation, nothing of experiment, nothing of in-

duction, nothing of causation." I think no statement could have been made more

opposite to the undoubted facts of the case, that mathematical analysis is constantly

invoking the aid of new principles, new ideas, and new methods, not capable of being

defined by any form of words, but springing direct from the inherent powers and
acti-^ity of the human mind, and from continually renewed introspection of that inner

world of thought of which the phenomena are as varied and require as close atten-

tion to discern as those of the outer physical world (to which the inner one in each

individual man may, I think, be conceived to stand in somewhat the same general

relation of con-espondence as a shadow to the object from which it is projected, or
as the hollow palm of one hand to the closed fist which it grasps of the otlier), that

it is unceasingly calling forth the faculties of observation and comparison, that one

of its principal weapons is induction, that it has frequent recourse to experimental

trial and A'erification, and that it aftbrds a boundless scope for the exercise of

the highest efforts of imagination and invention.

  Lagi-ange, than whom no greater authority coidd be quoted, has expressed em-

phatically his belief in the importance to the mathematician of the faculty of ob-

servation                                      Gauss  has  called  mathematics a science of the eye,  and  in  conformity
                                            ;

with this view always paid the most punctilious attention to preserve his text free

from typographical errors ; the ever to be lamented Riemann has written a thesis to

show that the basis of om- conception of space is purely empirical, and our know-

ledge of its laws the result of observation, that other kinds of space might be

conceived to exist subject to laws difierent from those which govern the actual

space in which we are immersed, and that there is no evidence of these laws ex-

tending to the ultimate infinitesimal elements of which space is composed. Like
his master Gauss, Riemann refuses to accept Kant's doctrine of space and time

being forms of intuition, and regards them as possessed of physical and objective
reality. I may mention that Baron Sartorius von Waltershause'n (a member of this

Association) in his biogTaphy of Gauss ("Gauss zu gedachtniss "), published

shortly after his death, relates that this great man was used to say that he had laid
aside several questions which he had treated analytically, and hoped to apply to them
geometrical methods in a future state of existence, when his conceptions of space
.should have become amplified and extended ; for as we can conceive beings (like

infinitely attenuated book-wonns* in an infinite!}' thin sheet of paper) which possess

only the notion of space of two dimensions, so we may imagine beings capable
of realizing space of four or a gi-eater number of dimensionsf. Our Cayley, the centi-al

luniinaiy, the Darwin of the English school of mathematicians, started and elabo-

rated at an early age, and witli happy consequences, tlie same bold hypothesis.

Most, if not all, of the great ideas of modern mathematics have had their origin

in observation. Take, for instance, the arithmetical theory of forms, of which the

foundation was laid in the diophantine theorems of Fermat, left without proof by

their author, which resisted all the eflbrts of the myriad-minded Euler to reduce to

demonstration, and only yielded up their cause of being when turned over in the

blowpipe flame of Gauss's transcendent genius; or Ihe doctrine of double periodi-

city, which resulted from the observation by Jacobi of a purely analytical fact of

transformation ; or Legendre's law of reciprocity; or Sturm's theorem about the roots

of equations, which, as lie informed me with his own lips, stared him in the face in

the midst of some mechanical investigations connected with the motion of compound

pendulums ; or Iluyghens' method of continued fractions, characterized by Lagrange

as one of the principal discoveries of " that great mathematician, and to which he

appears to have been led by the construction of his Planetary Automaton ; " or tlie

now algebra, speaking of which one of my predecessors ( Mr. Spottiswoode) has

said,_not without just reason and authority, from this Chair, " that it reaches out

and indissolubly connects itself each year with fresh branches of mathematics, that

the theory of equations has almost become new through it, algebraic geometry

transfigured in its light, that tlie calculus of variations, molecular physics, and me-

chanics" (he might, if speaking at the present moment, go on to add the theory of

elasticity and the highest developments of the integral calculus) " have all felt

its influence."

Now this gigantic outcome of modern analytical thought, itself, too, only the pre-

cursor_ and progenitor of a future still more heaven-reaching tlieoiy, w-hich will

comprise a complete study of the interoperation, the actions and reactions, of

algebraic forms (Analytical Morphology in its absolute sense), how did this origi-

nate ? In the accidental observation liy Eisensteiu, some score or more years ago,

of a single invariant (the Quadriuvariant of a Binary Quartic) which he niet with in

the course of certain researches just as accidentally and unexpectedly as M. Du

Chaillu might meet a Gorilla in the country of the Fantees, or any one of us in London

a White Polar Bear escaped from the Zoological Gardens. Fortunately he pounced

down upon his prey and preserved it for the contemplation and study of future

mathematicians. It occupies only part of a page in his collected posthumous works.

This single result of observation (as well entitled to be so called as the discovery of

Globigerime in chalk or of the Coufoco-ellipsoidal structure of the shells of the

Foraminifera), which remained unproducti^-e in the hands of its distinguished

author, has served to set in motion a train of thought and to propagate an impulse

which have led to a complete revolution in the whole aspect of inodern analysis,

and whose consequences will .continue to be felt until Mathematics are forgotten

and British Associations meet no more.

   I might go on, were it necessary, piling instance upon instance to prove the para-
mount importance of the faculty of observation to the process of mathematical

diseoveiy*. Were it not unbecoming to dilate on one's personal experience, I

mycould tell a story of almost romantic interest about  own latest researches in a

field where Geometry, Algebra, and the Theory of Numbers melt in a surprising

bookworm in an unrumpled page : but what if the page should be undergoing a process

of gradual bending into a curved form ? Mr. W. K. Clifford lias indulged in some re-

markable speculations as to tlie possibility of our being able to infer, from certain unex-
plained phenomena of light and magnetism, the fact of our level space of three dimensions

being in the act of imdergoing in space of four dimensions (space as inconceivable to us

as our space to the supposititious bookworm) a distortion analogous to tlie rumpUng of

tlie page to which that creature's powers of direct perception have been postulated to be

limited.

ceedings of the London Mathematical Societj'*), which would \erj strikingly illus-

trate how much observation, divination, induction, experimental trial, and verifica-

tion, causation, too (if that means, as I suppose it must, mounting from phenomena
to their reasons or causes of being), have to do with the work of the mathema-
tician. In the face of these facts, which eveiy analyst iu this room or out of it

can vouch for out of his own knowledge and personal experience, how can it be

maintained, in the words of Professor Huxley, who, in this instance, is speaking of
the sciences as they are in themselves and without any reference to scholastic
discipline, that Mathematics "is that study which knows nothing of observation,
nothing of induction, nothing of experiment, nothing of causation."

   I, of course, am not so absurd as to maintain that the habit of observation of

external natm-e will be best or in an}' degree cultivated by the study of mathematics,
at all events as that study is at present conducted ; and no one can desire more
earnestly than myself to see natiu'al and experimental science introduced into our
schools as a primary and indispensable branch of education : I think that that study
and mathematical cultm-e should go on hand in hand together, and that they would
gi-eatly influence each other for theu' mutual good. I should rejoice to see mathe-
matics taught with that life and animation which the presence and example of her

young and buoyant sister could not fail to impart, short roads preferred to long
ones, Euclid honourably shelved or buried " deeper than did ever plummet

   It is this living interest in the subject which is so wanting in our traditional and
mediaeval modes of teaching. In France, Gei-many, and Italy, everywhere where
I have been on the Continent, mind acts direct on mind in a manner imknown to
the frozen formality of our academic institutions ; schools of thought and centres
of real intellectual cooperation exist : the relation of master and pupil is acknow-
ledged as a spiritual and a lifelong tie, connecting successive generations of great

thinkers A\dth each other in an unbroken chain, just in the same way as we read, in
the catalogue of our French Exhibition, or of the Salon at Paris, of this man or that

   This accounts, I believe, for the extraordinary longevity of all the greatest masters
of the Analytical art, the Dii Maj ores of the mathematical Pantheon. Leibnitz, lived
to the age of 70 ; Eulerto7(j; Lagi'ange to 77; Laplace to 78; Gauss to 78; Plato,

the supposed inventor of the conic sections, who made mathematics his study and
delight, who called them the handles or aids to philosophy, the medicine of the
soul, and is said never to have let a day go by without inventing some new

theorems, lived to 82 ; Newton, the crown and glory of his race, to 85 ; Archi-
medes, the nearest akin, probably, to Xewton in genius, was 75, and might have

said to be generated in the diseased oyster, or, as I have heard it described, "una

excroissance maladive de I'esprit humain." Others find its justification, its " raison

holding up the train of Physical Science ; and a very clever ni'iter in a recent maga-

more N\-orthy of interesting an intellectual human being, than the study of chess pro-

some of the bride and mortar, or even a quarried stone of a public building, or of

painting from the colours mixed on the palette, or of music by listening to the thin

and screechy sounds produced by a bow passed haphazard over the strings of a

A'ioliu. The world of ideas wliich it discloses or illuuiinates, the contemplation of

divine beauty and order which it induces, the harmonious connexion of its parts,

the infinite hierarchy and absolute CA-idence of the truths with which it is con-

cerned, these, and such like, are the surest grounds of the title of mathematics to

human regard, and would remain rmimpeached and unimpaired were the plan of
the universe unrolled like a map at our feet, and the mind of man qualified to

take in the whole scheme of creation at a glance.

In conformity with general usage, I have used the word mathematics in the

phu'al; but I think it would be desirable that this form of word shordd be re-

served for the applications of the science, aud that we should use mathematic in
the singular number to denote the science itself, in the same way as we speak of
logic, rhetoric, or (own sister to algebra *) music. Time was when all the parts of

the subject were dissevered, when algebra, geometry, and aritlimetic either lived

apart or kept up cold relations of acquaintance confined to occasional calls upon

one another ; but that is now at an end ; they are drav^m together and are constantly

becoming more and more intimately related and connected by a thousand fresh ties,

and we may confidently look forward to a time when they shall form but one body

with one soul. Geometry formerly was the chief borrower from arithmetic and

algebra, but it has since repaid its obligations -with abundant usury ; and if I were

revolves, the central idea which pervades as a hidden spirit the whole corpus of

mathematical doctrine, I should point to Continuity as contained in our notions of

space, and say, it is this, it is this ! Space is the Grand Cmitiiuimn from which, as

from an inexhaustible reservoir, all the fertilizing ideas of modem analysis are de-

rived ; and as Ih'indley, the engineer, once allowed before a parliamentary com-
mittee that, in his opinion, rivers were made to feed naA'igable canals, I feel almost

tempted to say that one principal reason for the existence of space, or at least one

principal function which it discharges, is that of feeding mathematical invention.

Everybody knows what a wonderful influence geometrj' has exercised in the hands

of Cauchy, Puiseux, Riemann, and his followers Clebsch, Gordan, and others, over

the very form and presentment of the modem calculus, and how it has come to

pass that the tracing of curves, which was once to be regarded as a puerile amuse-

  * I have elsewhere (in my Trilogy published in the 'Philosophical Transactions') re-

ferred to the close connexion between these two cultures, not merely as having Arithmetic

for their common ])arent, but as similar in their habits and affections. I have called

ment, or at best useful only to the architect or decorator, is now entitled to take
rank as a high philosophical exercise, inasmuch as every new curve or surface, or
other circumscription of space is capable of being regarded as the embodiment of
some specific organized system of continuity*.

   The early study of Euclid made me a hater of geometry, which I hope may plead
my excuse if 1 have shocked the opinions of any in this room (and I know there are
some who rank Euclid as second in sacredness to the Bible alone, and as one of the

advanced outposts of the British Constitution) by the tone in which I have pre-
viouslj^ alluded to it as a school-book ; and yet, in spite of this repugnance, which
had become a second nature in me, whenever I went far enough into any mathemati-

cal question, I found I touched, at last, a geometrical bottom : so it was, I may

myinstance, in the purely arithmetical theory of partitions ; so, again, in one of

more recent studies, the purely algebraical question of the invariantive criteria of
the nature of the roots of an equation of the fifth degree : the first inquiry landed

me in a new theory of polyliedra ; the latter found its perfect and only possible

complete solution in the construction of a surface of the ninth order and the sub-

division of its infinite content into three distinct natural regions.

   Having thus expressed myself at much greater length than I originallj' intended

on the subject, which, as standing first on the muster-roll of the Association, and
as having been so recently and repeatedly arraigned before the bar of public

--opinion, is entitled to be heard in its defence (if anywhere) in this place,- having

endeavoured to show what it is not, what it is, and what it is probably destined to
become, I feel that I must enough and more than enough have trespassed on your
forbearance, and shall proceed with tlie regular business of the Meeting.

    Before calling upon the autliors of the papers contained in the varied bill of
intellectual fare which I see before me, I hope to be pardoned if I direct attention
to the importance of practising brevity and condensation in the delivery of coni-

numications to the Section, not merely as a saving of valuable time, but in order

that what is said may be more easily followed and listened to with greater plea-
sure and advantage. I believe that immense good may be done by the oral inter-

change and discussion of ideas which takes place in the Sections ; but for this to
be possible, details and long descriptions should be reserved for printing and reading,
and only the general outlines a)Kl broad statements of facts, methods, observations,
or inventions brought before us here, such as can be easily followed by persons
having a fair average acquaintance with the several subjects treated upon. I

understand the rule to be that, with the exception of the author of any paper who
may answer questions and reply at the end of the discussion, no member is to

address the Section more than once on the same subject, or occupy more than a
quarter of an hour in speaking.

   In order to get through the business set down in each day's paper, it may some-
times be necessary for me to Iwing a discussion to an earlier close than might

otherwise be desirable, and for that purpose to request the authors of papers, and

those who speak npon them, to be brief in their addresses. 1 have known most

able investigators at these Meetings, and especially in this Section, gradually part
company with their audience, and at last become so involved in digressions as to lose

entirely the thread of their discourse, and seem to forget, like men waking out of
sleep, where they were or what they were talking about. In such cases I shall
ventiu-e to give a gentle pull to the string of the kite before it soars right away
out of sight into the i-egion of the clouds. I now call upon Dr. Magnus to read

his paper and recount to the Section his wondrous story on the Emission,
Absorption, and Reflection of Obscure Heatf.

   The numerator and denominator of the fraction on the left-hand side of the equa-
tion in Theorem I. are quantities either of which I call the distance of the point a
from the curve Cm- The coiTesponding quantities in Theorem II. I call the Distance

of the lino A from the curve C,,. The reason of this is iu the similarity of the ana-

lytical expressions for the distance of two geometrical forms in all cases, viz. the
distance vanishes when the two forms have contact, and is infinite when either of
them has contact witli the "absolute." The "absolute" in plane geometry (so
called by Professor Cayle}-) is the two circular points at infinity.

   I also consider the modifications undergone by these theorems in the case of

spherical curves.

sis " of Grassmann, itself a development of a remark of Leibnitz.

Sketch of a Proof of LKjranjes Equrdion of Motion referred to Generalized

                     Coordinates. By II. B. Haywakd, M.A.

   Suppose a material system with n degrees of freedom, i. e. one for the determi-
natiou of whose position and configuration ;; absolutely independent variables or
coordinates are necessary and sufficient. Denote one of these coordinates b}' q, and
suppose q to be changed to q-\-^q ; then a given particle (mass m) of the system re-

ceives a displacement definite in intensity and direction, which may be denoted by
kbq, where k may be regarded as a magnitude definite in intensity and direction,

mwhich may be called the " variation coefficient " of the particle with respect to

the variable q. It is plain that /; is in general a function of all the n coordinates.
If V denote the velocitj^ of the particle «i in any possible state of motion of the

system, T(or gSwy-) the vis liva of the system, and q the rate of change of q or the
diffiirential coefficient of q with respect to the time, the author proves that, suppo-

sing T expressed in terms of the n coordinates q &c., and their differential coefficients

with respect to the time q' &c., and --- denoting the partial differential coefficient

of T with respect to q,

                              --- ='S,(jnhv cos ^),

where (/) is the angle between the directions of h and v, and the summation extends

to all the particles of the system. The quantity 2(7nJ;v cos<^) may be appropriately
termed the jxirtial momentum of the system v\-ith respect to the coordinate q ; and
it is easil)' seen that the ii partial momenta with respect to the n coordinates com-

pletely determine the motion of the system. It thus appears that each of the well-

known equations of motion in the Lagrangean form

                              ./.^

does but express the relation between the rate of change of one of the partial mo-

menta with the time and the forces acting on the system.

This interpretation immediately suggests a direct proof of Lagrange's equations

without any reference of the system to fixed rectangular or any other special system

of coordinates as in the proofs hitherto given. The direct result of diti'erentiating

2(wiAycos (^) with respect to the time t is reduced to the required form by the help

of the equation

where et is the rate'of change of the direction of A; in the plane of v and k ; a relation
which it is not difficult to establish.

  On Curves of the Third Der/ree, here called Tertians. Bi/ F. W. Xewmax.

   The object of this paper was chiefly to suggest a nomenclature for those curves
of the third degree which are diametral or centric ; but to make the argument
clear, a concise discussion of the curves was necessary, and a paper was annexed on

the roots of a cubic equation.

only one real factor, (4) may bavo three' real unequal factors. Accordingly the

curves fall under four distinct groups.

=which in T3 is in cube, is reducible to the single species mj- x^, the Twisted

   It is here shown that for a single diameter it is essential ritJier that the curve be

Summary of ike Thermodynamic Theory of Waves of Finite Longitudinal
    Disturbance. By W. J. Macqugen Rankine, C.E., LL.D., F.R.S.

This paper contains a summary accoimt of the results of a mathematical inves-

tigation, the details of which have been communicated to the Royal Society. It

relates to the laws of the propagation of finite longitudinal disturbances along a

cylindrical or prismatic mass of an elastic substance of any kind, solid, liquid, or

gaseous. The investigation is facilitated by the use of a quantity called the 7nass-

velocity or smnatic  velocity  of propagation                                                                        that is, the  mass of matter through
                                                                                                                  ;

which the disturbance is propagated in unity of time along a tube of the transverse

area unity ; also by expressing the relative positions of transverse planes in sucha
tube by means of the masses of matter contained between them, instead of by their

distances apart. The first part of the investigation relates to the conditions under

which the propagation of a wave of longitudinal disturbance of permanent type is

possible ; and it is shown that the principal dynamical condition of permanence of

type is the following          --E =ffi^ (a constant)
                                   as

in which p denotes the intensity of the longitudinal elastic pressure in absolute
units of force per unit of area, 5 the bulkiness of the substance (that is, the volume

mof imity of mass), and the constant is the mass-velocity already mentioned. (That

pi'oposition had been previously demonstrated in a less elementary manner by IMi".
Earnshaw.) Then, by the aid of the thermodynamic fwicfion, it is shown what
conditions as to the transfer of heat between the vibrating particles must be fulfilled

in order that the above relation between pressure and bulkiness may subsist. Those

conditions are the more nearly realized, the more abrupt the changes of density
which constitute the disturbance ; but they cannot be absolutel}^ realized in any
actual substance ; whence it is concluded that absolute pennanence of tj'pe for an
indefinite time in waves of longitudinal disturbance is impossible, and that it is
most nearly approximated to when the disturbance is abrupt.

   The latter part of the investigation relates to adiabatic u-aves ; that is, waves in
which there is no transfer of heat from particle to particle, and the thermodynamic

function is constant. In this part of the investigation, the results are to a great
extent identical with those previously arrived at by Poisson, Stokes, Airy, and

especially Earnshaw ; but are obtained by methods that are comparatively of an
elementary kind. It is shown that in adiabatic waves there must be a change of
type as the wave advances; that dm-ing that change of tv'pe the greatest compression
and greatest rarefaction remain constant; that the compressed parts of the wave
gain upon the rarefied parts of the wave, and at length overtake them, converting
a wave which was originally one of gradual distiu'bance into one of sudden dis-
turbance ; and finally, that the compressed and rarefied parts of the wave by their

mutual interference cause the dissipation of its energj' in molecular agitation. It

is conjectured that this phenomenon may be the cause of the non-existence of lon-
gitudinal vibrations in rays of light. It is analogous to what takes place in the
motion of rolling waves in shallow water, when the crests overtake the troughs

and at length break into them.

On Secular Variations of Lunar Tints and Spots and Shadows on Plato.
                            By R. W. BiRT, F.E.A.S.

One of the most promising lines of research having reference to the physical

aspect of the moon's surface consists in an examination from time to time of the

tints which characterize every portion of the visible disk. To take this in its en-

tirety would be a most enormous labour; the only way to deal with a subject of

this kind is to select a few of the most prominent objects which differ in brightness

and  colour,  and    regularly   observe                       them at stated intervals                                                                                                               if even half a dozen
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

such objects were selected and observed on every occasion when the moon appeared

above the horizon, as the observations proceeded it would be found that not only a
large amount of labour must be expended before any valuable results could be ob-

tained, but the observations must be continued over a long period of years to eli-

minate the effects of those agencies which produce merely apparent changes. That

changes of tint and brilliancy occur on the moon's surface is very evident ; no lunar

observer is ignorant of the fact that many portions of the surface vary in tint during

the  course  of the  luni-solar  day                      the  variation  of  brilliancy  in many                                                                                                     of  the brio-hter

spots is still more marked during the same period, and these variations havelbeen

referred, probably with great truth, to the change of angle at which the sun's lio-ht

falls upon the objects, but up to this time we are really destitute of the "proof"
16 REPORT-- 1869.

of this being actually the case. The scales of tint and brilliancy adopted by the

three leading selenographers of the present century differ from each other, and the

observations which have been referred to solar altitudes and azimuths are so ex-

ceedingly few, that legitintatebj to connect variations of brilliancy with change of

illuminating angle is quite out of the question still the presumption is strong that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

the most striking changes of tint and brilliancy are connected with variations of

illuminating angle. It is not, however, light alone that affects the objects in the

way observed ; tlie nature of the materials of which they are composed plays an

important part, some reflecting more, some less light than others.

  When we enter upon a comparison of tints, eitlier observed directly by means of

the telescope or recorded on photogranis, with those given on our maps or recorded

in the works of selenographers, we are often struck with the differences thus de-

tected                           but  as  we fail to connect by ordinary inductive processes  apparent vari-
                              ;

ation of brightness with change of illuminating angle, simply on account of the

absence, on the one hand, of a suitable scale of brightness, and on the other, of a

discussion of the observations with respect to solar altitudes and azimuths, so with

regard to the differences just alluded to, we fail to refer them to change of a phy-

sical character, just because we are destitute of the necessary evidence that the

spots were really darker or lighter than they are at present.

While the scales of SchriJter, Lohrmann, and Beer and Miidler differ among

themselves, the tints or brilliancy ascribed by each selenographer to the objects

recorded by him are comparable one with the other upon his particular scale, and

thus a means exists of ascertaining at the epoch of each whether one of any two

spots was brighter or darker than the other at the phase at which the brilliancy

was determined. It is obvious that now, observations of the brightness of the same

two spots may be obtained at about tlie same phase, provided the suitable oppor-

tunities be embraced, and thus a change of brilliancy or tint may be detected of

a different character to that dependent on change of illuminating angle ; for if the

observations be made at precisely the same phase as when the brightness was re-

corded, it is clear that the illuminating angle must be nearly if not quite the same,

consequently the variation of tint or brightness in one or both of the two spots must

be referred to some agency different from illumination.

Last year I solicited the attention of the Section to the difference of tint which

characterized a somewhat large shallow crater near Alpetragius, as compared with

the drawings of Lohrmann, Beer and Miidler, and Schmidt. The floor of this crater

was seen to be darker in 1808 than the siu-rounding surface, and therefore darker

than delineated by the selenographers just named. The same dark tint, imder every

phase at which it has been examined, has been observed without exception since

August 18G8. The legitimate conclusion is, that during the period of the obser-

vations in 1868 and in 1869, the surface of this crater was permanently the darkest

in the neighbourhood. If Lohrmann, Beer and Miidler, and Schmidt were correct

in their comparative delineation of the tint of this crater (and it is difficult to con-

ceive that three experienced selenographers could have fallen hito the same error),

we have presumptive evidence of a phenomenon which may be termed " a secular
variation of tint." What it arises from is altogether another question ; it, however,

does not stand alone on the sm-face of the moon.

To enter into any speculation as to the cause of such variations, whether from

bright to dark, or the reverse, is manifestly premature ; there is, however, a class

of phenomena which bears much on the same point ; the surfaces of many of the

larger smooth-walled plains are greatly diversified with spots, streaks, and in some

cases spreading fans of light ; the rays issuing from Proclus and spreading over the

Mare Crisium may be cited as examples of the latter. The walled plain Plato has

been the subject of numerous obsen-ations, both as regards its very interesting

mountain border and still more interesting floor. No two drawings of this floor

that I have seen precisely agi-ee, a result to be expected when we consider that

the differences of illuminating and visual angle tend materially to influence its as-

pect as seen fi'om the earth, added to which, we have the difterent impressions pro-

duced at different times on artists and observers ; still the differences dependent

upon illumination &c. will have a limit ; certain well-known features will always

be recognized, although somewhat altered in appearance at different times j it is

after a lapse of years that a well-conducted series of observations will determine

if there he secular chano^e in these stripes and tints. Should some disappear, and

others not observed before become visible, tlie presumptive evidence is that a secular

change has taken place. This appears to be the case -with several spots on Plato.

The earliest record that I have been able to find of any well-defined small spots on

the floor is that of Clruithuisen, who observed eight ; later records furnish evidence

of eighteen additional spots having been observed. Of these, nine have been added

so recently as last February and since. Of the twenty-sLx recorded, six of the

earliest observed are still visible, and of the nine seen since January last five have
been more or less constantly seen by two observers, leaving fifteen which have

either become invisible or are very rarely seen.

  When the sun is rising upon Plato the shadows of the peaks on the western wall

are admirably calculated to identify certain of these spots, and probably of deciding
between craters opened on tlie floor of Plato and those small white spots to which
Herr Tempel solicits attention as indicative of a tvann chemical activity, and which

appear mider a high solar illumination, there being no indication whatever of cra-

ters existing on their sites as the terminator passes them.

Beer and Madler measured the three peaks on the western wall, viz. y, d, and

e, the heights being as under :

             y=72o8 Eng. feet, 8=6369 Eng. feet, e = 5128 Eng. feet.

   Challis measured the shadows on May 16, 1853. The measures were made

parallel and perpendicular to a line coincident with the longest diameter of Plato.

At the time Challis observed Plato nine spots had been recorded as having been

seen on the floor, four of which were delineated by Challis, numbered 1, 3, 4, and 5.
They have since been observed by Eosse, Dobie, Dawes, and Pratt, and some of

them by Knott and other observers.
   Rosse in 1862, Dawes in 1863, and Birmingham in 1869, observed the shadow

of the peak y in close proximity with No. 5 (?). Rosse and Birmingham have drawn
No. 1 with the shadow of S just receding from it, and Binningham gives No. 3 at
the) extremity of the shadow of the northern peak e. As matter of observation
these are important ; for by the variations of the seasons at the moon the shadows

vnll fall somewhat diflerently in summer than in winter ; the extreme range is,

however, but small, the azimuthal angle with the same altitude not exceeding 3°

and as solar azimuths at the moon are easily calculated, no real difficulty exists in
identifying these spots as lying near the shadows of the peaks. The peaks them-

selves merit attention ; Challis's shadow of S terminates by a straight line ; he
measured the two extremities of this line. Rosse delineates the termination of the

shadow as from two pinnacles upon the summit, with the crater No. 1 between them.

Birmingham gives the south pinnacle only, with the crater No. 1 just beyond it. In

Dawes's drawing No. 1 lies between the shadows of -y and 8. There are other peculi-
arities about the shadows which require the solar azimuths to be calculated for illus-

trating them. It is to be hoped that good drawings, accompanied by descriptions of

the shadows of the west wall and craters visible on the floor, vdll be midtiplied, as
in referring such drawings and descriptions to the respective periods at which they

were made in the luni-solar year, we may become better acquainted with the nature

of the summit of the wall, and by means of large apertures, small craters on the

floor, hitherto overlooked, may be detected.

Although this branch of lunar physics is confessedly difiicult, it is by no means

insurmountable. The greatest drawback consists in the paucity of recorded obser-

vations of an earlier date, from which arises the uncertainty of the existence of the

more recently obsei'ved spots. The way, however, for precise observation and

careful discussion is gradually opening, and we may hope that Schmidt's suggestion

of " trying by the aid of more powerful telescopes to represent the topography of

the yet undelineated details of the surface of the moon," may bear good li-uit, al-

though the further we proceed the more unable are we to see the end of the work

" it is," says Schmidt, '' as if from the ordinary determination of place of the brighter

stars down to the eighth magnitude, one passes on to that of the stars of the Milky

Way." So, in like manner, each addition to om- knowledge of lunar physics leads

us onward to the study of still more minute forms, in which perhaps lui'k the germs

of future interesting and important discoveries.

On the Loin/itude of the Eadcliffe Observatory, Oxford, as deduced from Me-

   As the luoon has been observed for several years at the Eadclifte Observatory

with the Carringiou Trausit-cu-cle, Mr. Main has tliought it desirable to make, by
means of the observations as compared with those made .at Greenwich, a determi-
nation of the longitude of the Observatory. The whole number of observations
employed is 217, and include all that were made on the same day at the two Ob-
servatories from the year 1864 to 1868, both inclusive.

   The following Table gives thelresults deduced from the observations of each year,
together with the final result of the whole of the observations, and the probable

errors :-

process is to examine, for all the zeuitli-point groups having a suihcient number of

star-observations, the results given by north stars, by south stars, and by observa-

tion of the reflected image of the wire. If the means of these separate results were

exhibited in the Greenwich observations, it would be easy to see at a glance that

the zenith-points given by north stars frequently differ considerably from thos(>

given hy south stars, though the mean of these always agrees well with the nadir

result. This would show that the circle-readings require a variabh; correction

depending on the .«ine of the zenith-distance, but none depending on tlie co.sine,

or that the error has for its cause cither an erroneously assigned flexure of telescope,

or something that produces a similar error in tlie circle-readings. Now, in any

one of these cases, as the assumed zenith-point is the mean of all the results (north

stars, south stars, and nadir), it is plain that, while it is applied bade again to the

circle-readings for direct and reflexion observations of north and south stars, the

zenith-distances deduced from the direct and reflexion observations will be dif-

Dferent, and that the difference will change signs at the zenith, or that the l! will

have ditt'erent signs for north and south stars. Pursuing this iuvestiu-ation through

all the groups, Sir. Main succeeds in reproducing the mean results given in what
R Dis usually called the
                                                                                                                              Table, which appears in each Greenwich volume. This

discordance then is plainly traced to changes (much more frequent than is usually

supposed) in the state of the instrument, which render the corrections depending

on the sine of zenith-distance variable, and which we may therefore presume to be

of the nature of flexure.

         Remarls on the British Association Catahr/ue of Stars.
               Bij the Rev. R. Main, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.

The object of this paper was to show the necessity which exists for the construc-

tion of a new general compiled catalogue of stars to replace that which was pub-

lished in the year 1845, under the direction and at the expense of the British As-

sociation. The author would not have ventured in his ovni person to bring this

matter before the Association, if his attention had not been directed to it by the

circumstance of his having nearly completed the reobser\ation of all the .stars con-

tained in it which are visible at "Oxford, and which require observation.

  By this means a rather singular class of errors was brought to light, which, it

was thought, might be interesting to astronomers, and to which it is desirable to

give publicity.

The principal modern catalogues which were used by Mr. Baily for comparison

with the more ancient catalogues of Bradley, Lacaille, and Piazzi, were those of

Taylor and Jh-isbane, the places of the stars in both of the last-mentioned cata-

logues being, from causes which it is not necessary now to mention, very faulty.

Now, unfortunately, the differences of the right ascensions and declinations given

by the ancient and modern catalogues, when reduced to the same epoch, have been

attributed not to errors of the observations, but to proper motion, and the resulting

proper motion is not only set down in the column appropriated to it, but is used in

bringing np the star's place to the epoch 18.50. The results of the observations

of Bradley and Piazzi, which of themselves woidd have been very reliable, are

thus seriously vitiated                                                                                                       and any one  interested  in  the inquiry may convince him-
                                                                                                                           ;

self of the truth of the above statement by consulting the notes ap]3ended to the

catalogues of stars in the Radclifle Observations, commencing with 1862.

In addition to this, the author observes that the utility of' the catalogue of the

British Association is greatly diminished, not only on account of the badness of

the star-places, but on account of the interval wliich has elapsed since the epoch for

which the star-constants are calculated, namely 1850. For results of the utmost

exactness it is now unsafe to use these constants ; and, on the whole, it appears de-

sirable that the Association should shortly consider the propriety of undertaking

a new catalogue, which shall embody the plentiful and accurate results of star-

observations during the past quarter of a century.

20 REPORT-- 1869.

On the recent fall of an Aerolite at Kruhenhurg in the Palatinate.

                         By Dr. A. NEuirATER.

MayOn tlie 5tli of  last, at 6.32 p.m., tlie inhabitants of tliis village were startled

by a terrible noise like the discharge of heavy ordnance from some point high up

in the air, which at the time was perfectly clear. It lasted about two minutes, and
was followed with a rolling sound like thunder, which ended with a sort of whir-

ring, whistling sound. The people were greatly frightened, and nobody could

explain the cause ; they saw at length the trees moved by some miaccountable

agencj^, though not a breath of wind was stirring. Two men working in the fields

near the village, however, were not at a loss for an explanation, for they saw a
mass of stone fall to the ground, shaking it for a considerable distance. It was

found the stone liad penetrated the ground to a depth of two feet, which they soon

imearthed. It was still warm but not dangerous to touch. The walls of the hole

were perfectly perpendicular. The sound was heard over a district whose radius

was thirty miles. The meteorite (for such it was soon recognized to be) was care-

fully removed, and its weight ascertained to be 31^ lbs. Several pieces had been

knocked off. It was of a grey colour, small specks of a^metallic nature being every-

where visible, and likewise small discoloured particles of a globular form._ Subse-

quent analysis gave the specific gravity 3-446. It was composed of chrome-iron 0-94,

magnetic pyrites 5-72, silica 43-29, alumina 0-63, mag-nesia 2-01, protoxide of iron

21-06, soda 1-03. It is of the class of meteors termed chondrites. This fiery

rushing bod}', though broad daylight, was seen flying through the zenith of a place

thirty-five miles south-east of the locality where it fell. The author gave_ other

trigonometrical and astronomical particulars showing the height at which it was

seen. When passing through the atmosphere it showed a bluish light, leaving a

bright stripe of light long after the body had disappeared. AVhat made the fall of

this aerolite specially interesting is the fact that it was possible to determine the

radiant-point of the shower of meteors'to which it evidently belonged. The author

said the radiant-point of this system was described in the Tables of the British As-

sociation Committee on Luminous Meteors as being " well defined." He hoped

that some day " we should succeed in finding the comet whose orbit will exhibit

elements identical with that of the meteors, placing us in the proud position of being

able to state that we have already a portion of that comet in our possession."

   On the Appearance of the Nebula in Argo as seen in the Great Melbourne
                   Telescope. By tlie Rev. Di-. Robixson, F.li.S.

   Owing to various circumstances this instrument was not available for work till

20th June last, wlien jMr. Albert Lesueur, the astronomer to whom it is entrusted,

turned it on the nebula in Argo, and communicated to Dr. Robinson the results of
his observations, -vyith a pencil drawing laid down by comparison with adjacent
stars bj' means which, though not of the highest precision, are yet so exact that

future measures are not lilcely to make any material change. On comparing this
sketch with the admirable map of this nebula given by Sir J. Ilerschel (Cape Ob-

servations, p. ix.), it is evident that great changes have occurred in the last thirty-
four years. The most remarkable feature in the nebula is a black opening in the

brightest part of it, forming a kind of lemniscate. As Sir J. Herschel saw it, this
figm-e had two constrictions, was closed below by a barrier of less bright nebula,
and had two small stars exactly on its edges, f Argus, then larger then Sirius,

was south of the upper constriction and on a bright ground. Now the lemniscate

has only one cousti-iction ; its southern part is of a totally different shape, and there

is but a bare suspicion of any nebulous bar there, even -with the great light of this

telescope. The two stars referred to are now completely in the nebula and on the
parallel of the constriction. ( Argus, now only 65 mag., is on a faint ground and

remote from the bright nebula, and is nearlj- in the parallel of the north termina-
tion of the lenmiscate. These changes are not in the stars; for Mr. EUery has

found that down to 9^ mag. they are in verj' close accordance with Sir J. Herschel's

places ; there is also south preceding the top of the lemniscate, a V-like bay very
nearly as black, and vni\\ edges as bright, which could not possibly have been

overlooked in the 20-feet reflector had it existed. The amount of change thus in-
dicated implies such prodigious movements in this nebula, as to make it pro-
bable that its distance from us is less than was supposed by astronomers, and point

it out as deserving most careful -watching, with circumstances as litte varied as

possible. It may even be hoped that the spectroscope will give some such evi-

dence of its motion as Mr. Iluggins has obtained with Sirius.

                    0)1 Comets*. By Prof. P. G. Tait, F.B.S.E.

   The principal object of this paper was to investigate how far the singidar phe-

nomena exhibited by the tails of comets and by the envelopes of their nuclei, the
shrinking of their nuclei as they approach the sun, and vice- versa, as well as the

diminution of period presented by some of them, can be explained on the probable

supposition that a comet is a mere cloud of small masses, such as stones and frag-

ments of meteoric iron, shining by reflected light alone, except where these masses
impinge on one another, or on other matter circulating- round the sun, and thus

produce luminous gases along \A\h considerable modiflcations of their relative
motion. Thus the gaseous spectrum of the nucleus is assigned to the same impacts

which throw out from the ranks those masses which form the tail. Some of the
most wonderful of the singular phenomena presented by comets, such as the almost
sudden development of tails of many millions of miles in length, theoccm-reuce of
comets with many tails, and the observed fact that there is no definite relation of
direction between a comet's tail and its solar radius-vector, were here looked upon

as due to the diflerences of motion of these discrete fragments relatively to the
earth in a manner somewhat analogous to the appearances presented by a distant
flock of seabirds flying in nearly one plane, and only becoming visible as a long

streak when the plane of the flock passes approximately through the spectator's
eye. The so-called envelopes are compared with the curious phenomena presented
by tobacco-smoke (which seem, however, to be emitted in a form apparently re-

semblingthincontinuous films of smallparticles of carbon) ,and the so-called "gaseous

jets " which appear to be projected from the nucleus and to be repelled from the sun,
are not diflicult of explanation, the author considered, from the general points of view

here taken. Investigation, mainly conducted by quaternions, show how a group
of discrete masses, so small that their mutual pertm-bations are not of great mo-

ment except in the case of actual impact, gradually changes its form, as it revolves
about the sim, independently of any hypothesis as to the cause, planetary attraction
or othei-wise, by which it was first introduced into the solar system. The ideas
here brought forward occurred to the author more than two years ago, on his being
made aware of the identity of the orbits of the August meteorites and of Comet II.,
1862 ; but they seemed so obviously to follow from that identity that it was only

on reading Dr. Tyndall's recent speculations, and on being informed by Prof. New-

ton that the question of tails, envelopes, and " gaseous jets " had been treated by
Schiaparelli, as proving the existence of a repulsive force, that he ventured to pro-
duce an explanation so apparently simple and yet so inconsistent with what appears

to be held by the majority of astronomers.

                On the Influence of Annealing on Crystalline Structure.
                           By Chakles Brooke, M.A., F.B.S.

   The author having been recently engaged in the construction of a rock-salt
spectroscope for observations on the heat-spectrum, met v.nih an unexpected diffi-
culty in the construction of the prisms. In some of the optically best specimens
of rock-salt in his possession, it was found that, in forming equilateral prisms one
side of which was cut parallel to a cleavage plane, the opposite angle intended to
be the working angle of the prism was repeatedly traversed by spontaneous clea-

vage fissures, cand the prism consequently became incapable of being worked. As
this was probably due to internal strains analogous to those in imannealed glass,
which were fm-ther rendered evident by a considerable action on the polarized

ray, inconsistent with the normal character of the crystal, it occurred to the
author that this inconvenience might probably be remedied by some process
of annealing ; and the result proved to be completely successful. Owing to the
low heat-conductibility of rock-salt, and its great lial)ility to fissure on change of
temperature, it was obviously necessary that that change should be effected veiy

slowly. With this view the rock-f;alt was deeply imbedded in sand in a tin box,
and gi-adually during twelve hours heated up to about 250^ C. by a flame of gas
placed beneath; it was then allowed to cool gradually, and was subsequently

woi-ked without any difficult)'. It further appeared that the previously observed
action on polarized light was very sensibly di.ainished, as was sliown by comparing-
two sketches make by Mr. Erowning before and after the process of annealing.

silver, lead, and thallium, the combining proportions of which would have to be

halved to bring tliem nearly into their right places in the list.

   Though the relation between these numbers has not the exactness of a physical
law, it shows some connexion between the power of a metallic element to refract
the rays of light, and its power to saturate the affinities of other bodies. The same
relation does not hold good ^^dth reference to tlie non-metallic elements.

   Methode pour ohtenir les Images MonocJiromatiques des Corps Lumineux,

                                Par le Dr. Janssex.

  A la suite de Teclipse du 18 Aoixt, 1868, j'ai propose ime methode pour obtenir

les images nionochromatiques des corps lumineux (voir les Comptes Rendus de

I'Academie des Sciences de Paris, 11 Janvier 1869, et 22 Mars 1869).

   J'ai I'honneur de doimer a I'Association Britanuique, quelques details sur cette

methode.

   Imaginons qu'on fasse tomber I'image d'une flamme (pour prendre un exemple)

sur  la   fente  d'un  spectroscope la                                                         spectre  forme                                 resultera,  dans  le  sens  de  sa

hauteur, de la juxtaposition de tous les spectres lin(iaires fournis par les rayons

lumineux qui penetrent par divers points de la fente.

   Supposons maintenant qu'on place au point oil le spectre se forme dans la lu-

nette oculaire (tournee vers I'teil), ime seconde fente parallele a la premiere.

Cette fente isolera dans le spectre, une ligne lumineuse d une couleur determinee

suivaut le point du spectre ou elle aura ete placee. La hauteur de cette ligne et ses

divers degres d'inteusite lumineuse seront en rapport avec celles de I'image de la

Hamnie au point oil elle est coupee par la fente du spectroscope.

   Si Ton imagine maintenant que le spectroscope tourne autour d'un arc passant

par les deux fentes, alors les diverses parties de I'image lumineuse viendront suc-

cessivement produire leur ligne nionochromatique dans la lunette d'exploration,

et si le mouvement rotatif est assez rapide, la succession de toutes ces lignes pro-
duira une impression totale qui sera I'image de la flamme formee avec les rayons

d'une seule refraugibilite.

  En depla^ant la fente oculaire, on pourra obtenir la serie des images monochro-

matiques de cette flamme.

  Pour avoir plus d'egalite dans I'intensite des diverses parties d'lme meme image,

on pourrait donner a la fente une ouvertiire plus grande vers les points les plus

eloignes de I'axe de rotation.
   Appliquee au soleil, cette methode pourrait foumir les images de I'ensemble des

protuberances.

   I'our la vision d'une protuberance isolee, la methode de INI. Huggins appliquee
par ^I. Zoellner pent avoir certains avantages. Mais le moyen actuel permettrait

d'obtenir I'ensemble du phenomene, et d'ailleurs, c'est surtout comme methode

pour obtenir la serie des images monochromatiques des corps lumineux, que je la

con.sidere comme interessante.

   Hence, if we measure along the axis of abscissae distances representing the
values of x in a series of experiments, and raise ordinates proportional to the

change in rotation caused by the addition of the acid, the locus of the extremities
of these ordinates will be a right line, provided that the quantity of acid be not
greater than that required to convert the whole of the base into the lowest or

least acid salt.

   Suppose, now, tliat this limit has been attained, and that we continue the addi-
tion of the acid. By tliis continued addition we shall commence the formation of
a new salt from the first salt, ju.st as before we formed the first salt from the base.
And if we continue the foimer construction, we shall still have as the locus of the

extremities of the ordinates a right line, but not in general the same right line.
The completion of the first salt is indicated by the transition from the one line to
the other. The same reasoning applies to every subsequent salt, the completion of
each definite compound being in general indicated by a break, in the locus.

arsenic acid upon brucia.

On the Determination of tlie Beal Amount of Evaporation from the Surface of
                  Water. Btj Eogees Field, B.A., and G. J. Symons.

   The authors hegin by pointing out the extremely discordant results arrived at
hitherto by the highest authorities as to the amount of evaporation from a water-
surface ; one observer, for instance, giving tlie amount as 44 inches, and another
giving it as 11 inches for the same year. Some difference in the results might be
expected, in consequence of difference of locality, but such startling differences
can, it is believed, only be explained hy the very faulty nature of the evaporators
in common use. After giving a quotation from Professor Daniell's Meteorological
Essays, strongly condemning the ordinary evaporators, the authors proceed to cri-
ticize the mode of calculating the evaporation from hygrometric observations, pro-
posed by Professor Daniell as a substitute for quantitative measurements, and
come to the conclusion tliat this method is practicallj' useless.

   The great objection to ordinary evaporators is their diminutive size, in conse-
quence of which the water becomes unduly heated, and evaporation unduly
increased. The only published experiments on a large scale of which the authors
are aware are those made at Dijon, and other places on the Bm-gundy Canal, with
tanks eight feet square, and these gave an evaporation of only about half that

generally adopted for the district. Moreover, a small tank one foot square placed
by the side of one of the large tanks, gave an evaporation 50 per cent, greater than

that from the large tank. Some experiments on a smaller scale at St. Helena
also show the way in which rmdue heating increases the evaporation. In these a
small evaporator, fully exposed, gave 50 per cent, more evaporation than a similar

evaporator placed in a tub of water.
   Large tanks, like those at Dijon, can, however, only be used in exceptional cases,

and it therefore becomes important to devise some simple arrangements which
should give approximately correct results. The authors have recently commenced
some experiments on the subject, and desire to place upon record .some of the facts

arrived at.

   In these experiments the depth of water evaporated was ascertained by direct
measurement, without emptying the evaporators, as is generally done. This mea-
surement was efl'ected by means of a small instrument, called a " hook-gauge,"
shown on the accojiipanying diagram. The point of the hook can be adjusted with
great precision to the exact level of the surface of the water, and the depth read

off on a vernier to the hundredth of an inch. By resting the clamped bar on the

top of the evaporator, the zero can be placed in any convenient position.
   The arrangements adopted by the authors are shown on the cliagram. Fig. 1 is

perhaps one of the best forms of ordinary evaporators, consisting of a copper
vessel fully exposed ; fig. 2 is an an-angement designed by Mr. Symons, wherein
the vessel, still of metal, is sunk almost wholly in the ground ; fig. 3 is a modifi-
cation of the St. Helena plan, consisting of a glass cylinder placed in the centre

of a much larger vessel of water.

  A detailed Table is given of the observations for three weeks, ending August

12, 1869. The chief residts are--

      (1) The total evaporation from fig. 1 was 4'37 inches, from fig. 2, 3'13 inches,

On the Changes of Temperature and Hmniditij of the Air tip to XOOQ feet, from

  ohservations made in the Car of M. GiffanVs Captive Balloon, By Jajies

   Glaisher, F.R.S., F.B.A.S., cjr.

     [A communication ordered to be printed in extenso in the Proceedings.]

The necessity which existed in all the free balloon ascents I made in connexion

with the British Association of leaving the earth with a great ascending power

to avoid striking adjacent buildings, caused the first few hundred feet to be passed

through too quickly to enable me to determine satisfactorily the temperature and

humidity of the air at the lower elevations ; at the higher elevations the obser-
vations Avere repeated at vnW, as I could descend by allowing an escape of gas,
or ascend by discharging sand as frequently as I thought desirable. The Avant of

the power of repetition of observation within 1000 feet of the earth has caused

our knowledge of the temperature and humidity of the air within this distance to

be more limited and less accurate than at higher elevations. The theory of the

Pdecline of of temperature in every increase of 300 ft. of elevation was proved to be

erroneoii? in everv ascent; in some a decrease of 1° and more than 1° was experi-

enced within the first 100 ft. (see ascents, July 30th, Eeport 18(32; July 11th,

Report 1863 ; and August 31st, Report 1863 and 1864), notwithstanding the
rapidity of motion ; and there is no doubt that if the balloon could have been kept
stationary at the height of 100 ft. on those occasions the decline would have been
much greater, whilst in others there has been no decrease of temperature within

this space (see April 6th, Report 1864 ; and Dec. 1st, 1864, Report 1865).

In some of the ascents a decline of 8° or 10' was met with within 1000 ft. of

the  earth  (see ascents of July 30th, 1862 ;  August  18th, 1862 ;  July  11th,  1863
                                                                                                              ;

August 31st, 1863, &c.), whilst in others but little or no difference was found

within 1000 ft. of the earth. This was very remarkably shoAvn in the descent on

June 13th, 1864, which was made at about sunset ; after this ascent it was noticed

that whenever ascents had been made in the afternoon hours the changes of tem-

perature near the earth were smaller at the time of descent than at the time of
ascent ; but this was not found to be the case with the ascents which had been

made in the morning hours. Two ascents only were made after sunset, the one on

October 2nd, 18(35, with a clear sky, and the other on December 2nd, 1865, -nath a

cloudy sky ; in the former, with a clear sky, the temperature increased on leaving

the earth, and continued to increase with elevation, began to decrease on descending

and continued to decrease till the earth was reached, the change of temperature
during the ascent being somewhat smaller than during the descent. The second
night-ascent on December 2ud, 1865, was made with a cloudy sky ; the tempe-
rature at first decreased, then became stationary, then increased when between 1400
and 1800 ft. liigh ; at greater heights the temperature decreased ; thus towards the
end of the series of experiments, which were made for the British Association, it
was found that the observations indicated that the change of temperature near the

earth varied greatly, followed no constant law, in fact, appearing to differ at the
different hours of the day ; but the ascents were too few in number and too dis-

connected (having been made in every month of the year, at different times of the

da)' and under different states of the sky) to be able to say positively that such was

the case.

   These experiments, however, unsettled our previous views, and caused a suspi-

cion to rest on the amounts applied for correction of refraction in astronomical

observations.

   The great captive balloon, recently located at Ashburnham Park, Chelsea, and

Icept constantly inflated with 420,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas, in connexion

with a powerful steam-engine, was admirably adapted to settle all these points,

myand M. Gitfard, its proprietor, most kindly placed it at  disposal for any series

of experiments to which I could apply it.

This balloon could ascend on a calm day to the height of 2000 ft. ; its rate of

ascension could be regulated, and the ballooa could be kept all but stationary at

any point, for anj' length of time.

   The instniments were fixed on a stand attached to the outside ring of the cir-
cular car, so that the instruments were out of all influence of persons in the car,
and shielded from the sun and radiation in the manner described in the preceding

volumes of the British Association.

The ascents and descents were usually even and moderately slow, the balloon re-

maining at its highest point till the temperature and hygrometrical state of the air

at that"point were assured. The readings of the several instruments were taken

on the  ground just before  an  ascent and again  just after its  completion                                       the mean

manner the readings were taken at every 100 ft., as near as possible, both ascending

and descending, and their means taken "to represent the temperatures at these ele-

vations. In this way the numbers in the following Table were fonned :

7° -4 less temperature at 1000 ft. high at the first experiment about one-fourth part,
or l°-9, took place in the first 100 ft. ; at the last experiment there was no decrease
between this space, the temperature being sensibly the same as on the ground up

to 200 ft.
   In both states of the sky the temperature at the height of 1000 ft. underwent

less change than on the earth, and therefore the rates at which the temperature
changes with the height, is not independent of the time of day. The next Table

but one (see p. 37) contains the decrease of temperatui-e for every 100 ft. as found

from the preceding Tables in every series of expei-iments.

   On July 17th, 23rd, 24th, and 28th more than one series of experiments were

taken during the afternoon hom-s, and in every case the changes are smaller at the

later than at the earlier experiments. On JiUy 23rd and 24th nine sets of experi-

ments  were  made  on each  day, between  the  hours  of 3 p.m.  and  7.30 p.m.                                     ou the

foi-mer under a cloudy, and ou the latter under a clear sky. In both series the largest

changes are those in the first set of experiments ; and the smallest those in the

last set, so that experiments made at the same hours must be grouped together

and distinct from those at other times. Comparing the changes in the first 100 ft.,

it will be seen they are larger with a clear than a with cloudy sky. By comparing

the general results with the two states of the sky together, it will be seen that

the changes from hoiu: to horn- are less with the cloudy than with the clear sky,

and consequently the experiments in the two states of the sky must be treated

separately. The following Table has been formed by taking the means of obser-

vations between the same hours in the two different states of clear and cloudy skies.

axis, and the time of a complete oacillatioii twenty-four hours. If this be so, the

numbers in Table VI. in each of my Keports in the years 1862-66, under the head

of means up to 1000 ft. high, both in the clear and cloudy states of the sky, must not
be considered as of general application, as supposed when the Reports were written,
but the individual residts ii'om which the means were deduced must be grouped

together according to the hour of observation.

On the Formation of Dew, and its Effects. Bij Henet Hudson, M.D.

    The author contends that the condensation of atmospheric moisture tends
necessarily to produce an " inversion of the normal law of its temperatm'e." From

a full analysis of all ]\Ir. Glaisher's balloon ascents, he shows that, in every in-

stance, there is an increase of temperatm-e "above the clouds," /. e. where vapour
is condensed. The night ascents are peculiarly interesting. That on the 2nd of Octo-

ber 1865 distinctly proves an increase of temperatm-e as we ascend in clear calm
weather, "when condensation takes place;" and the ascent on the Slst of March

1863 is equally conclusive in proving that, " with a blue and almost cloudless

sky," no such inversion of the normal atmospheric temperature may occur, simply

because "the dew-point, just before reaching the earth, was on this occasion
12i degrees below the atmospheric temperature, and was even much further
removed at the higher elevations." Hence there was no condensation of vapom*
dming this ascent, and consequently the law of " diminution of temperatiu-e with

increase of elevation" was never subverted.

The author asserts that Dr. AVells, from not attaching its due weight to this

source of atmospheric heat, was led to adopt an erroneous theory, all his ingenious

experiments clearly showing that the phenomenon which required explanation in
" dewy nights " is "increase of temperature in ascending from the earth," and not

merely a chilled surface in reference to the air generally.

   If we assume terrestrial radiation as a cause, it is evident that the maximum

absoi-ption of heat must occur in the loicest sti-atum of the atmosphere, and this

could not therefore in any way contribute to " greater heat " at higher elevations.
Many of Dr. Wells's assumptions are plainly inadmissible ; for instance, " that
dense clouds near the earth must possess the same heat as the lower atmosphere ;"

and again, "that terrestrial radiation nmst have a ready transit through an atmo-

sphere which transmits solar heat copiously." Also (as if to explain the inversion of

the normal atmospheric temperature) he assumes " that the superficial stratimi of
air proceeds to radiate back to the earth its excess of heat" (acquu-ed by radiation

FROM the earth), " and that it is thereby more chilled than the superior strata,"

apparently forgetting that if it radiated to the earth it must do so also to the
upper strata, which (in lilre manner) must be considered to radiate both upwards

and downwards, and his hj'pothesis is therefore utterly worthless for explaining

the phenomena. The chilling effect of air descending from the higher regions
appears to be altogether ignored by Dr. WeUs, and he assumes that clouds act as
radiators of heat to the earth, instead of merely " screening it " from the extreme

mchilling etherial influences (in a manner similar to the "raised board " his own

experiments), and yet he admits that " during nights, generally clear, if the zenith

be occupied by a cloud for only afeio minutes, a thermometer on the grass will rise

Aseveral degrees."  cloud " in the zenith " may well act as a screen and produce

such a result; but its influence cannot be attributed to "radiation of heat to the

thermometer." It merely interferes to diminish the chUl from above, and thus
enables the heat of the earth to regain its ascendency in warming the surface. The

author also adverts to the fact observed in Mr. Glaisher's last recorded ascent

(29th May 1866), that " at the height of 6200 feet (the sun having set nearly

twenty minutes) the temperature was about 6 degrees warmer than at the same

elevation an bom- before."

  In page 6 (Casella's edition), Dr. Wells -writes, " Dew probably beyins to appear

upon grass, in places shaded from the sun, during clear and calm weather, soon
after the heat of the atmosphere has declined ; " and again, " I have frequently

felt yrass moist, in dry weather, several hours before sunset-" on the other hand, "I
--40 REPORT 1869.

have scarcely ever kno^vn dew iipon grass to exhibit visible drops before the sun

was very near tlie horizon, or to be very copious till some time after sunset."

Again (page 27) he wi-ites, " According to a few observations made by me, the

greater coldness of gTass than that of the air begins to appear, in clear and calm

weather, in places sheltered from the sun, soon after the heat of the atmosphere

has declined. Hence it is evident that the " dew-process'' was in active operation

long before he could possibly find any addition to the weight of his wool, and, as

regards the amount of heat received by the air, it is sufficient to point out that the

latent heat of 20 gi-ains of moisture (which he frequently found in 10 grains of

wool) woidd raise the temperature of 20 cubic feet of air about 8 degrees ; hence

we see what an enormous amount of heat must have been given out by the vapour

deposited on the grass-plot, and wonder how such a "vera causa" has been ignored

--in the explanation of the phenomena ; and yet Dr. Wells only notices the fact in

the following terms (page 53) : " The formation of dew, indeed, not only does not

produce cold, but, lilie every other precipitation of water from the atmosphere,

produces heat." He knew that heat was eliminated, and that it was not commu-

nicated to the surface, and yet failed to see in it the source of atmospheric increase

of temperature. In page 72 Dr. Wells admits that " bodies exposed in a clear

night to the sky must radiate as much heat to it during the prevalence of wind

as they would do if the air were altogether still, but in the former little or no cold

will be observed upon them above that of the atmospheric." That is to say, there

was little dew, and therefore the air had received little or no heat from this som'ce.

If Dr. Wells had given actual temperatures, instead of merely " differences," we

should have had far more satisfactory data to go upon.

   In conclusion the author insists that Provost's Theory of Exchanges cannot be
reconciled to the different " radiation energies " of surfaces. Imagine a thermo-

meter in the focus of a metallic mirror, and a cubic canister (two adjacent sides

being bright metal and the other two varnished) placed angvlarhj in the Ime of

nished sides are " radiating " to the mirror, there will be no efiect on the focal

hall, and yet the " radiating energy " of the varnished sides is manifold greater

than that of the metal ; why, then (on Prevost's theory), does not the focal ther-

mometer indicate this increased effect, as concentrated by the mirror ? It will be

understood that the angular position of the canister is to meet any hypothesis of
Athe " metal reflecting the thermometer's radiation hack again to it."
                                                                                                                                                  fortiori

(under the above arrangement), if the canister alo7ic be reduced below the tempe-

rature of the air, why does the varnished surface chill the thermometer more than

the metal, although the former is so much more potent in radiating heat ?

^\.bove thii'ty-four j'ears ago the author devised what he considered an cxperi-

mentum crncis on this subject. He had a vessel made of zinc, with one side of it

a mirror. This was filled with water at 173° F., and one ball of a delicate differ-

ential thermometer haviug been placed in the focus of the miiTor, the other ball

Awas moved round until tlie instrument marked zero.                                                                                               large tin screen was in

front of the mirror, at a distance of about 6 feet. The temperature of the room

being 55°, a cubic canister (as described) containing water at 67° was placed just

in front of the screen ; the focal ball showed increase of temperature, and the rise

was greatest with the varnished sides of canister. On moving the canister nearer

to the mirror, these effects diminished, and at a certain distance the effect (from

hoth sides) became nil. On being moved nearer still the canister began to act as

if it were [a cold hod;/, and the varnished surface produced the gTeater chilling
A Aeffect.
paper, containing these results, was' read by the author in Section at

the first Dublin Meeting of the British Association (in 1835), and was honoured

by having been printed in extcnso, amongst the Eeports. The author did not then

call attention to tlie consequences of these experiments, saving that he considered

them only explicable on a " Wave Theory."

As Prevost's theory is still received by the first physicists of Europe, the author

no longer hesitates to assert that it is not true. The facts adduced appear to

him to demonstrate that when any body is of the same tempcrattrre as the medium,

there is no "radiation," but when it is either warmer or colder than the medium,

waves (either ot excess or deficiency) are propagated from it through the medium,

a result to which a rude analogy may be found in imagining a bucket of water
poured into (or taken out of) one end of a long narrow channel of still water. The
previous equilibrium is thereby overthrown, and a wave is propagated either from

or towards the site of the disturbance.

      The Rainfall of Natal, South Africa. By Dr. Mann, F.E.G.S. Sfc.

   The British colony of Natal, situated on the south-east coast of Africa, 800
miles beyond the Cape of Good Hope, lies between the 27th and -Slst parallels of
south latitude, and the 29th and 32nd meridians of east longitude, looks out
upon the Indian Ocean by a coast-line of 150 miles broad, and slopes down from a
height of 6000 feet, where the inland frontier is formed by the rim of the great
tableland of the Continent. The general set of the air-current is from the moist
spaces over the ocean, up this rapid land slope, and the rainfoll of the colony is in
the main due to this cause. The result is a very remarkable climate, in which
tropical productions grow luxuriantly in the lower districts, and temperate produc-
tions thrive in the higher regions. The mean temperature of the year is 64°'7 at
a height of 2000 feet, and 69-'-2 on the coast.

   The year is divided into a wet and dry season, rather than into a summer and
winter season. The six months from October to March are cloudy and moist, and
the six months from April to September are months of bright and rarely inter-
rupted simshine. The entire rainfall, for a period of ten years, at an elevation of
2095 feet, and 45 miles inland, was 302 inches, giving a mean yearly fall of 30-22
inches ; of this 25-o3 inches fall during the six summer months, and 5-09 during
the six winter months. The mean monthly fall for the summer period is 4-2 inches

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the same for the winter period is 0-87 of an inch. The increase and diminution
of the fall is singularly regular, as becomes apparent when the progression is repre-
sented in a diagram traced out pictorially upon paper.

   Tlie months of April and September are properly intermediate months in regard
to rainfall. Thej' have each a mean fall of one inch and a half, while the mean

monthly fall for the rigidly dry period from May to August barely exceeds half

an inch.

   The heaviest rainfall in one year during this period was 37-31 inches ; the least
rainfall in one year 22-34 inches. Upon eight months out of the 120 comprised

in the period of observation, no rain fell on 33 months only. The monthly fall
was less than one inch, on one occasion onty. There were 107 days in succession
without rain. Eight other intervals ga\-e rainless periods of between 40 and 68
days, and 13 intervals of between 20 and 33 days.

   There were 19 months on which the monthly fall reached 5 inches, 9 months
on which it reached 6 inches, 2 months on which it reached 7 inches, and 1
month when it reached 8-95 inches. There were 49 days on which the daily fall
exceeded 1 inch, 13 days on which it reached 14 inch, only 5 days on which it
exceeded 2 inches. The heaviest daily fall was 2^ inches. The heaviest fall at
Maritzburg on consecutive rainy days was 10-81 inches.

   The rivers in Natal are low, iDut not dry in the winter season, and are swollen
during the six months of heavier rain. The coast district alone is subject to
occasional devastating floods. In 1857 there was one in which the river Unr>-eni
near its mouth in the neighbourhood of the seaport of Durban, rose 28 feet above
its ordinary level, and overflowed a considerable space of low groimd near the
port, carr\-ing down cattle, large deposits of reeds and large trees, to the sea. In
1868 another coast-flood took place, in which a fine iron-girder bridge, 900 feet
long, and recently erected over the same river at a cost of £19,000, was carried
away, and in which damage to the extent of £100,000 was inflicted on public
works and private property.

   The rainfall on the first occasion was 21 inches on the coast, and 11 inches at

Maritzburg. On the second occasion IGi inches on the coast, and lO'Sl inches at

]\[avitKburir.

   Tlie ordinary rains of Natal are caused by the moist sea-air rushing sud-
di'iily inland to considerable elevation, and thence becoming rarefied and depo-

siting the moisture suddenly in the midst of violent electrical demonstrations, con-

stituting thunderstorms. The storms occur soon after 2 p.m., and rain continues
to fall into the late evening, but this fall is followed by a fine morning. The
storms occur three or four successive days, with a low barometer, and there is
then a similar rainless interval, with a higher barometer. The devastating coast-
fioods are, however, due to another class of rains, namely, rains accompanjdng
strong sea-gales from the south or south-west, and going in continuously for two or
three days at a stretch. They occm' often with a high barometer. During these
rains the rainfall is much heavier on the intermediate coast than it is further
inland. On the higher hiUs it diminishes into a thick mist, like that which is
often found on the Scotch mountains. In one marked rain of this character, in
which the author was caught between swollen coast rivers, the fall on the coast
was 8'97 inches, and at Maritzburg, 2095 feet high, l'2;j inch.

   Taken altogether, the coast rainfall is hea^^er than the rainfall at an elevation
of 2000 feet. The entire rainfall for the two years 1866 and 1867^ on the coast
and at Maritzburg, was

BemarJcs on Meteorolocikal Reductions, ivitli especial Reference to the Element

                     of Vapour. By Balfour Stewart, F.R.S.

   It -will be desirable to preface the method of reduction herein proposed by a few
remarks on the objects contemplated in such reductions. These objects are two-

fold. In the first place, meteorological reductions may be pursued -ndth the

immediate object ot acquiring information as to the climate of a place ; or

secondty, they may be pui-sued with the immediate object of extending cm" know-

ledge of meteorologj', regarded as a physical science.
    Ihus, for instance, a certain kind of reduction might be imagined to be of

immediate practical benefit in determining whether a certain place might suit a
certain class of persons or a certain class of plants, but yet it might not materially
advance our knowledge of meteorology, regarded as a physical science. But, on
the other hand, all observations tending to advance our knowledge of meteorology
are of undoubted practical benefit. The amount of vapour present in the air is
without doubt a very important element of climate, inasmuch as this aflects in a

marked manner the skin of the human body and the leaves of plants ; but I am

not aware that it has yet been determined bj^ the joint action of naturalists and
meteorologists what is the precise physical function which expresses proportionally
the effect of moisture upon animal and -vegetable life. Is it simply relative humi-
dity ? or does not a given relative humidity at a high temperature have a difierent
effect from that which it has when the temperature is lo-w ?

    There is, in fact, an absence of information as to the precise physical formula
 which is wished by phj^siologists as expressing the effect of moisture upon organic

life. On the other hand, physicists may be presumed to confine themselves to

 meteorology regarded as a physical science. It is in this latter aspect that I pro-
 ceed to discuss the question.

    Regarding meteorology, therefore, as a physical science, it is one of our objects
 to ascertain the distribution and laws of motion of the dry and wet components of

 our atmosphere ; and it cannot be denied that we are at the present moment in

 very great ignorance of these laws.

   With respect to the motion of our atmosphere, it cannot be anticipated that
we shall ever possess the same sort of knowledge which astronomy gives us regard-

ing the motions of the heavenly bodies ; for in the latter case the identity of the

object is not lost sight of, while in the former case it is clearly impossible to ascer-

tain the motions of individual particles of air. Our inquiries into the distribution
and motion of the elements of our atmosphere must therefore be pursued by that
method which enables us to ascertain the distribution and motion of any other
substance or product with the individual components of which we find it imprac-

ticable to deal.

   Suppose, for instance, we wish to ascertain the wealth of our country in grain

Weor in spirits, and the distribution of this commodity over the earth's surface.

should first of all begin by taking the stock of the commodity corresponding to a'

given date we should next keep a strict account of all the imports and exports of
                                                           ;

the material, as well as of its home production and home consumption.
   Now, if we have taken stock properly at first, and if our account of the imports,

the exports, the production, and the consumption of om* material is accurate and
properly kept, it will obviously be unnecessary to take stock a second time. But

if these accounts are not kept with sufficient accuracy, or if we suspect that om*
material leaves us by some secret channel which we wish to trace, it will clearly

be necessary to  take  stock  frequently                                                   and thus a comparison  of our various
                                                                                        ;

accounts may enable us to detect the place and circumstances of that secret transit

which has hitherto escaped our observation.

Applying these principles to the vapour of our atmosphere, what we wish to

know is the amount of the material present at any one station at anj' moment, and

also the laws of its motion. It would appear that the best way of measuring the

amount present at any moment is by ascertaining the 7nass of vapour present in a

cubic foot of air, mass and "s-olume being fundamental physical conceptions.

Next, with regard to the motion of the atmosphere, including its vaporous con-

stituent, the method of coordinates suggested by Dr. Robinson would appear to

be the natural way of arriving at this. Let us set up at a station two imaginary

apertures, one facing north and south and the other east and west, and gauge the

mass of dry air and the mass of moisture that passes each of these openings in one

;hour we shall by this means get the nearest attainable approach to the elements
Weof motion of the atmospheric constituents from hour to hour.
                                                                                                                  shall not, how-

ever, obtain by this means a complete account of this motion, for we have at pre-

sent no means of measuring its vertical component. This vertical component

corresponds in fact to the secret channel in the illustration given above, which we

must endeavour to detect by some indirect method. Another thing that ought to

be determined is the production or consumption of the vaporous element of our

atmosphere as it passes from place to place. This might be done could we keep

an accurate account of the evaporation and the precipitation, the two processes

by which this element is recruited and consumed. This would, however, be a

very difficult observation.

Let us now recapitulate what information regarding moisture we can obtain
Wefrom such meteorological observations as are at present made.
                                                                                                                  have

(1) The mass of vapour actually present at a station from hour to hour.
(2) The mass that passes a station in one hour, going east and west.
(.3) The mass that passes a station in one hom-, going north and south.

There is wanting

(4) The vertical component of the motion of vapour.

(·5) Its production or consumption as it passes from place to place.

  --These deficiencies may, however, be to some extent overcome by the following

considerations :

First, the atmosphere moves as a whole when it moves, the dry and moist air

moving together ; secondly, dry air is neither capable of production or of consump-

tion, but always remains constant in amount.

To illustrate this part of the snbject, let it be supposed we wish to investigate

the vertical motion of the atmosphere at a certain station. Make this station the

imaginary centre of a circle, the circumference of which may be supposed to be

studded with other stations at sufficiently frequent intervals, so that we can tell,

                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS,                                                                   45

hour by hour, how much dry air passes in towards the centre of the circle through
its circumference, and also how much passes out.

Let us suppose that more is passing in than is passing out, or that the imports

into the area of the circle are greater than the exports out of it. Now, the dry

air that passes in is incapable of production or of consumption, and hence the

stock of the material at the central station, and in the area generally', ought to be

on the increase, since we have imagined the imports to be greater than the

exports. If, however, we ascertain from actual observation that the stock of dry
air is diminishing instead of increasing, we may be sure that some is carried on

by an upward current, which of course carries the moisture with the dry air.

So much for the vertical component ; and in the next place, with regard to the

Sreduction or consumption of      aqueous vapour    as it passes from place to place.
                                  been confined to

                                                                                           ;

is meant bj^ the hygrometric quality of the air. It may be represented by the fol-

lowing quotient :

                   mass of vapour in a cubic foot

                                       mass of dry air in a cubic foot

  Now this quotient can only alter by evaporation, by precipitation, or by mixture.

This hygrometric quality of the air may perhaps be considered as a quality
sufficiently constant to aid us in tracing the actual motion of air, just as we may
make use of the element of saltness to trace the actual path of an oceanic cur-
rent. But besides this aid, we may make use of it to enable us to tell the precipi-
tation or evaporation. For instance, a very damp air, in passing over a very dry
country, may be supposed to emerge less damp, having its hygrometric quality
changed ; or a very dry air, in passing over a very damp country, may be supposed

to emerge less dry, having its quality changed in the opposite direction. Thus,

by actual observation of the quality of the air at the tmie of its reaching some

particular tract of land or ocean, and at the time of its leaving it, we may pos-
sibly get much better observations of what goes on in the country, as far as this

particular research is concerned, than if it were studded with gauges.

   I should therefore suggest that meteorological observations should, by a system
of reduction, be made to show

(1) The mass of dry air and moisture in one cubic foot actually present at

each station from hour to hour.

(2) The mass of dry air and of moisture that passes each station, hour by

hour, in two lines of direction at right angles to each other, namely,

north and south and east and west.

When these hom-ly elements are obtained, they might for seasonal changes be

reduced after the method of five-day means, or for the investigation of abrupt

changes of weather, such as storms, they might be utilized in some other way.

Iletaining the belief that meteorology ought to be treated as much as possible

with the view, in the first place, of determining the actual motions of our atmo-

sphere, and, in the next place, of assigning the cause of these, it is no doubt the

greater movements of the atmosphere that will be indicated by five-day means.

It ought, however, to be remarked that the observations at any station are subject

to the influence of locality, none probably more so than those of wind. It would

appear that this influence ought to be eliminated before we can make any trust-

worthy quantitative deductions regarding the gi-eater movements of our atmosphere.

I should, however, imagine that the quality of the air, as herein indicated, may be
made of immediate use in the study of storms.

It has been suggested by Mr. Meldrum, who expresses his concurrence' with

the above remarks, that in addition to the five-day means indicated above, there

might be given a brief epitome of the weather. Thus, for instance, " The wind

Kewblew from the N.E. at  from January 1st, 1 a.m., to January 4th, .3 p.m., in all

86 hours, at the average velocity of 10 miles an hour, with an average pressure of

30 inches, a temperature of 40° F., and an average hygrometric quality repre-
sented by -075." The same remarks had previously occurred to myself, and Mr.

Aiiy also has recently suggested the study of the meteorological phenomena of
those periods during which the wind blows in the same direction.

Descrij)tion of some Lecture- experiments in Electricity *.

            By Professor G. C. Foster, F.R.S.

In this communicatiou the author draws attention to the facility with which

the transient electric currents accompanying the production and disappearance of

electrostatical charge can he detected hy the use of Sir William Thomson's re-

flecting galvanometer; and, in illustration, describes the application of this in-

strument to the investigation of the action of the electrophorus, and to the comparison

Aof electrostatic capacities and electromotive forces.  description is also given of

a simple method of proving the existence of the inverse and direct extra-currents

in coiled conductors.

  On the Metallic Deposit obtained from the Induction-discharge in Vacwtm-

                          tuhes. By J. P. Gassiot, V.P.R.S.

   The usual metallic deposit obtained from the discharge of an induction-coil in
vacuum-tubes is known to arise from minute particles of the negative electrode,
emanating in a lateral direction from the wire ; these are thus deposited on the
glass with metallic lustre when examined by reflected light. Such particles are
very freely deposited from gold, silver, or platinum electrodes ; less so from iron,
copper, and other metals, but not from aluminium, although the latter becomes red-

hot and ultimately fuses.
   In one of Geissler's tubes with which I have for some time experimented, I ob-

tained, by using my extended series of the voltaic battery, not only a very dense

opake deposit on the glass round the negative electrode, but five or six bands of dark
deposit along the tube in carefully examining their position, I found they exactly

                                                                                                                           ;

coincided with the dark bands between the strite, that they did not increase in

density by continuing the discharge like the deposit round the negative, but remained
without any further change.

   I have not any record from Geissler as to the nature of the gas with which the
tube was originally filled, I therefore requested him to prepare other similar-shaped
tubes with the several simple and compound gases he nad previously used, but

AI have not as yet been able to obtain similar results in any of these vacuums.

short time since, when examining some vacuum-tubes at Messrs. Cetti & Co., my

attention was directed to one in which I observed a series of brilliant metallic

rings deposited inside the glass; on inquiry Mr. Cetti informed me that the tubes

had been originally charged with arseniuretted hydrogen and then exhausted in the
usual manner; that almost immediately after he had passed the induction-discharge,
the stratifications were much reduced, the beauty, as he described it, of the ex-
periment was destroyed, while on the inside of the several lu-anium glass bulbs
through which the discharge passed, a thick metallic coating, apparently the metal
arsenium, was deposited.

   This result appeared to me to explain that the deposit in Geissler's tube already

referred to, did not arise from particles of the negative electrode, but from the gas
with which it was originally charged ; and if this is the case, their being deposited
exactly in the spaces occupied by the dark portions between the luminous disks

may lead to a correct explanation of a phenomenon that has hitherto baffled the in-

genuity of the experimentalist.

   Wlien au insulated wire or cable is connected to a battery, and the deflection
noted on a galvauometer, tlie first rush of current into the cable is due to tlie

electrostatic capacity ol'the insulator. Battery-contact beiuji' still maintained, the de-

flection falls verj- rapidly at first, and gradually becomes reduced for some time after.
The ratio between the deflections for equal periods of contact is independent of the
length, and is greater or less according to the specific resistance of the dielectric.
The ratio is unaltered under diflerent electromotive forces, so long as constancy is
maintained during the time of observation, and the deflection itself the same at
the end of the first period of contact. But when, with diflerent electromotive

forces, the deflections at the end of the first period of contact are not the same, we
may obtain the deflections which should be given on prolonged contact, if we know

the deflection for a corresponding period by any electromotive force, since the
deflections for the first period of contact will have to one another the same ratio
which the deflections at any other period of contact have ; thus, if with a given

electromotive force we obtain at the end of the first minute's contact a deflection

of 84, which at the end of the second minute is reduced to 7G, and with a difi"erent

electromotive force we have a deflection of 70 at the end of the first minute's

contact, the deflection at the end of the second minute will have the same ratio to
70 which 84 has to 70. Under diflerent temperatures the resistances corresponding
to one, two, three, &c. minutes' contact follow the same law of variation ; thus if

R = >· X const, represent the resistance after one minute's contact, then

of electrification retained at any given interval is proportional to the quantity of
chart^e remaining at that time. The longer battery-contact is maintained, the
slower will a core or cable lose its charge, and conversely. In a cable which has
been charged by contact with a battery for one minute, and afterwards held free
for one minute, the electrification will be the same as if, instead of being held free, it

--had been left connected to a battery having the last tension, thus : If the discharge

after one minute's contact and one minute's insulation be 180, and the immediate
discharge 200, the duration of contact being also one minute, the total eflfect for
electrification at the end of the minute's insulation will be 95 per cent, of what it

would have been if connected to the same battery for two minutes. By taking

these considerations into account the formula of Professor Fleeming Jenkin,

may be rendered strictly applicable for deducing from the loss of static charge in

time i, the i-esistance for the same period of contact in absolute measure, or in

K Kterms of that system which makes and functions of each other ; and we may
K Rexpect that the capacity can be eliminated from this formula when is known,

if we can determine the constant for electrification for the interval of time during

·which the core is held free.

   In this formula if the test is performed in the mamier here indicated t wiU be 60,

Rand the value obtained for will be the resistance at the end of the second minute
                  --Q

more nearly as approaches 1. This resistance has then to be divided by a

number which expresses the ratio between the first and second minutes' contact.

Approximately, and on short lengths of core, this may be obtained as follows :

Recharge the core after being kept to earth for some liours, maintaining contact

with the batteiy for two minutes before noting the loss ; then by dividing the

percentage of loss in the first experiment by the percentage of loss given in the

Rsecond experiment, we shall obtain a number by which, if be divided, the re-

sistance coiTesponding to one minute's contact may be found.

 -- DThe following ratio expresses the rate of increase on prolonged contact : Let

be the deflection at the end of the first period of contact and d the deflection at

Dthe end of the wth period, then  d d: : :  :  deflection at the end of ii- minutes.

On a New Anemometer for Measuring the Speed of Air in Flues and Chimneys.
                              By A. E. Fletcher, F.C.S.

This paper is a continuation of one read at the Dundee Meeting in 1867.

 Not able at that time to give a mathematical interpretation of the working of

_

his instrument, the author, resting on experiment, drew up an empirical table of the

Nowspeed of air indicated by it.     independent calculations are given, and the

results corroborated by experiment.

The problem to be solved may be briefly stated thus :

   The lower end of a vertical straight tiibe, open at both ends, dips into a liquid.
To what heig-lit wiU the liquid be raised in the tube by the action of a cun-ent of

air passing with a given velocity across its upper end ?

   On consideration, it will appear probable that the height of the column is but a

measure of the impact force of the air in motion ; experiment proves this to be the

case                    it shows that the liquid is drawn up to the same height it would have reached
                     ;

had the stream of air been directed against the surface of the liquid in the cistern.

The problem is now exchanged for one easier of solution.

The number 28-55 thus obtained by calculation diifers somewhat from the

number obtained by the experiments which were made two years ago. These were
not carried out with the accuracy that might now be obtained' by help of the experi-

ence which has been gained in the use of the instrument since that time j they have

therefore been repeated.
AThe same method was adopted as formerly.
                                            regular current of air was esta-

blished in a long flue or air-channel, one end of which was in connexion with a
high chimney, and the other end open. The speed of this current was measured

by the anemometer, and at the same time measured by noting the time a pufl' of

smoke took in travelling from one end of the flue to the other. These experiments
were made in three separate flues, and many experiments were made in each.

The value of c is found in each case from the formula

No, of
                                                                       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                              51

   The average value of c in the experiments is 28-50, while the vahie arrived at by
purely mathematical considerations is 28-55. This close correspondence is the more

satisfactory -svhen the difficulty of accurately measuring short intervals of time is
borne in mind.

   The formula v=A/px28:55 may therefore be adopted as correct. The author

has constructed a Table by means of it, showing the velocities which correspond to
the various readings of the anemometer; also a Table showing the coii-ection to be
made for variations in the temperature of the air whose speed is to be measured.
The corrections to be made for small variations in barometric pressure are unim-
portant. M'hen it is necessary to make the correction, recoui'se must be had to
the formula

according to the circumstances of the case. In the former the velocity is given in

feet per second of air measured under the barometric pressure existing in the air-

channel, in the latter it is given in feet per second of air measured imder a

pressure of 29-92 inches of mercury.

It may be asked if allowance should be made for the expansion or contraction

which win take place in the ether of the manometer when exposed to varying

temperatures. The variations of temperature to which the manometer itself are

exposed are not great, being those of the external atmosphere only. It will be

foimd that for a variation of 10 degrees the en-or introduced is about one per cent.
Thus if the manometer has been exposed to a temperature of 50°, and the speed

of the air experimented on is by calcidation 10 feet per second, the real speed will

be 10-1 feet. If the temperature of the ether in the manometer was 70°, then the

real speed in place of 10 feet -will be 99 feet per second.

In order to test by experiment the corrections of the formula for making allow-

ance for variations in the temperature of the air whose velocity is to be measured,

--the following trial was made : In a furnace, constructed for an experimental

purpose, a current of air entered through a pipe 9 inches diameter at a temperature

of_ 170°                                     after  traversing         channels of red-hot brickwork, it passed                                                                                                                                                                                      out through a

C-incli pipe at a temperature of 560°.

The reading of the anemometer at the inlet flue was 0-012 inch. Eeferring to

the Table, the speed given is 3-127 feet per second. The correcting figure for the

temperature 170° is 0-9083. Multiplying the two together, we have 2-84 feet per

second as the speed of the air measm-ed at 60°. The quantity of air passing was

therefore 1-255 cubic feet per second.

At the outlet pipe the anemometer reading was 0-102 inch, showing by the Table

a speed of 9-118 feet per second, to be multiplied by 0-7137, the figure of correction

for the temperature 560°. This gives 6-508 feet per second for the speed of air

measured                                     at  00°                   therefore  the  quantity of  air passing was                                                                                                                                                                           1-278  cubic  feet  per

second. The error is less than two per cent. Such an approximation is perhaps

as close as could be expected in measurements of this kind, and may, it is thought,

be taken as a confirmation of the general coi-rectness of the formulae.

Bescrijytion of a New Self-recordincf Aneroid Barometer. By F. Maetin.

On the Maury Barometer, a new Instrument for Meastiriny Altitudes.
                     By Feederick T. Mott, F.R.G.S.

The author said that at present there was no instrument in the hands of the

engineer by which he could make a rapid survey across moimtainous or hilly

country with ease and accuracy. At the suggestion of Captain Maury, Mr. E. T.

Loseby, a well-known chronometer maker, had invented a pocket barometer, which

promised to supply this desideratum.

The Maury barometer, lilie the aneroid barometer, measures the atmospheric pres-

sure by the expansion and contraction of a vacuum-box ; but this box is of larger size

in proportion to the instrument, and of superior construction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 and the measuring-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

tliiu steel di-op-piece between the screw and the vacuum-box. All levers, chains,
and spiral springs are got rid of, and the vacuum-box has got no work to do in
moving the machinery, the required force being supplied by the hand of the
observer. In shape and size the Mam-y is precisely like an old-fashioned watch.
The outside diameter is 2^ inches, the thickness about f of an inch, the weight
from .3 to -Si oz. (3n the dial is a scale ingeniously an-anged in spiral coils, on
which a range of 24 barometric inches, equal to 27,000 feet of elevation, can be
engraved, with 50 divisions to the inch ; the smallest di-visions, equal to about 20
feet, being perfectly leoible to the eye, and large enough for readings to be esti-
matfed accurately to 5 teet, and with care and practice almost to a single foot.
Various experimeuts were referred to, in which the Mauiy had been tested against
the aneroid, and found to be more regular and accurate.

  A plan, suggested by Captain Maury, was also described by which two travellers,

each carrying a Maury barometer, and following each other at definite intervals of
time and space, could make a very rapid survey over any extent of country, cor-

recting each other for all changes of general atmospheric pressure. In conclusion,

the author said that the inventor of the Maury barometer claimed for his instru-
ment a general superiority over the aneroid in the ratio of 4 to 1 ; and that the ex-
periments and compaiisons which had been described not only confirmed that claim,
but showed a much larger ratio of advantage.

On a Self-recording Rain-gauge. By Dr. Balfotte Stewart, F.R.S.

   The instrument described in this paper, and which was exhibited to the Meeting,

was invented bv Mr. Robert Beckley, of the Kew Observatory, and made and patented

by Mr. James tlicks, of Hatton Garden, London.

   It is designed to register the fall of rain by means of the varying immersion of

a float in a fluid, and consists of a vessel supported on an annidar plunger resting

on a cistern of mercury, into which the rain collected in a funnel is conducted.

A pencil is fixed to the vessel, and in its descent traces a curve on a cylinder
Awhich is moved round regvdarty by a clock.
                                             siphon of peculiar construction is

adapted to the receiver, so as to empty it immediately it becomes filled to a certain

height.

In the instrument exhibited the funnel, receiver, and float were so proportioned

that a fall of 0-25 inch of rain traced a line I inch long on the cylinder.

   The recording-cylinder is made of imgiazed eartlienware, and the whole of the

clock-mechanism employed to give rotation to the cylinder is enclosed in an air-

tight case, to protect it from the same injuiy by moistm"e,the motion being trans-

mitted by mercurial stuffing-boxes.

The whole apparatus is contained compactly in a cast-iron case, 14 inches square

and 10 high, and can be placed on the gTound or elsewhere without any special
arrangements being made for its erection.

                   On Collimators for adjusting Newtonian Telescopes.

                       By G. Johnstone Stonet, M.A., F.R.S.

   The author of this communication hnd described in I8o0, at the Cheltenham
Meeting of the British Association, a collimator for adjusting Newtonian telescopes.
The collimator resembles a small refracting telescope, with e^'epiece and cross-
wires, ditt'eriug from it only in the position of its object-glass, which is to be
pushed somewhat in, so that the light transmitted from the illuminated cross-wires
may leave the collimator as a divergent beam. To use this collimator, it is to be

substituted for the eyepiece of the telescope ; its construction then enables the
rays emitted from its illuminated cross-wires to reach the great speculum of the
telescope normally, so that, after reflection by tlie speculum, tliey return upon their
path and form an image, which, if the great telescope be in adjustment, coincides
with tlie cross-wires.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        53

Several years before, Sir John Herscliel described a very different collimator for

adjusting rotiecting telescopes, wliicli consists of a Kater's collimator fastened

inside the tube of tlie telescope, parallel to its axis. In using this collimator tlio

eyepiece is not removed. The collimator emits a parallel beam of light, which,

falling on the speculum, enables the cross-wires to be seen as a distant object,

simultaneously with the heavenly body under re-view.

Moreover the adjustments which the two instruments are capable of effecting

are also different. For while Sir John Herschel's collimator enables the observer

to bring the image of that point of the object towards which the axis of the tube of

his telescope is pointed, into the middle of his field of view, which is the adjustment

of most importance when the telescope is to be used as a surveyim/ instrument, Mr.

Stoney's collimator enables the observer, if his mirrors are out of adjustment, to

move the small mirror so as in the greatest possible degree to compensate for a faidty

position of the great speculum, which is the adjustment of most unportance, when

the telescope is used as an optical instrument.

Thus the collimators themselves, and the adjustments they effect, are entirely dif-

ferent yet Sir John Herschel, after describing his collimator in the later editions
                          ;

--of the 'Outlines of Astronomy,' writes in the following words of Mr. Stoney's

communication : "It is to be presumed that Mr. Stoney, in bringing before the

British Association in 1856 this application of the collimating principle as a novelty,

has been unaware of this its prior use, since he has not alluded to it. The direct

--reference of objects to the collimating cross described in the text would seem to

have been overlooked by him." Outlines of Astronomj', 8th edition, page 128.

It is true that Mr. Stoney was not aware in 1856 that Sir John Herschel had

suggested and used a different collimator for effecting other adjustments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       but  it is
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

equally true that manj^ readers have been misled by the foregoing passage into

supposing that Mr. Stoney reproduced in 1856 the instrument previously described

by Sir John Herschel. Moreover, the direct reference of objects to the collimating

cross was not overlooked by Mr. Stoney, as Sir .John Herchel supposes, inasmuch

as no such reference is possible in Mr. Stoney's collimator.

   On a clieap form of Heliostat. By G. Johnstoni; Stoney, M.A., F.B.S.

   This heliostat was planned throughout with a view to cheapness. It costs only

five guineas, and yet, in the opinion of the author, who has used the first of them

for a year and a half, is quite as ethcient as the more expensive instruments. It
has no second reflection, has the adjustments of the mirror under easy control, and
is adapted for use at any station within a range of latitude of five or six degrees.
It was made for the author by Messrs. Spencer and Son, of Dublin.

   Mr. Stoney expressed the opinion that a heliostat could be made on the same
plan at small cost, and yet so large as to be of much use in printing photographs,
and especially in enlarging them.

On the best Forms of Numerical Figures for Scientific Instruments, and a

        On Self-registering Hygrometers. By E. Vivian, M.A., F.M.S.

   Mean results in meteorology are ordinarily deduced from one or more daily ob-

servations at specified houi-s, with corrections for diurnal range ; or from curves
traced by photogTaphy or mechanical apparatus. In the rain-gauge, evaporating-
vessel, and certain forms of anemometer, the aggregate amomits, however fluctuating,
are obtained by accumulative action.

   The latter of these methods is the most certain, and admits of being more readily
reduced into a tabular form for the comparison of general averages. At a former
Meeting of the British Association the author exhibited self-registering instruments
--54 REPORT 1869.

on the cumulative principle for recordiug the mean -values of the difference between
the wet- and dry-bulb thermometers, and a self-registering maximum and minimum
hygrometer. The author now produced an improved form of the former instru-

ment, and a series of curves sho-ning the comparative results of Leslie's hygrometer,

his maximum and minimum differential, and his mean self-registering, which may

be regarded as the standard ; also the curve of evaporation of water in an open

vessel.

   It wiU be seen that these curves differ veiy widely as regards each period of
24 hours, but their monthly means are sufficiently imiform to show the approxi-
mate accm'acy of the old methods during a long continuance of observations. This
is still more evident from the second table, which extends over the greater portion
of two years. The author briefly repeats that the action of the 7nean self-register-
ing hj'grometer depends upon the condensation of the vapour of alcohol in the wet
bulb, tlie readings being taken from the fall of the column of spirit in the tube
which represents the drj^ bulb in Leslie's hygrometer. If the temperature of both
is alike there will, of course, be no action ; if a uniform dift'erence, say of 5°rahr. , that

figure will be indicated on the scale ; and if there is a fluctuating difference, say of

from 0° to 10°, dming the period which has elapsed since the last observation, then
the record will be 5°, or such other flgure as shall be the sum of the diflerences.

    The author has applied this principle to the recording of the aggregate dif-
ference of solar heat in sun and shade, and to the dm'ation of rain (the wet
bulb being supplied by a funnel into which the rain is received), and to the

amount of nocturnal radiation. He also proposes to apply it, in conjunction with

an evaporating vessel, to the recording of mean temperature. .Vise as an anemo-
meter, by deducting the results due both to heat and hygrometrical action.

On a Self-settinrf Type Machine for recoril'mg tlie Hourly Horizontal Motion
                         of Air. By C. J. Woodwaed, B.Sc.

   The author referred in the first place to the methods in use for recording the
horizontal motion of air. With a view of testing the errors incidental to the
method adopted in the Birmingham instrument, ho had had a series of readings
made by two independent observers, and he foimd that during the fifteen days over
which the observations extended, there were eighty-five differences of reading.
Errors, too, were liable to creep in when the first results were copied into the log-
book. To avoid these errors and with a view of obtaining the results in a neat
form, the author proposed a mechanical arangement in connexion wath the cups of
an ordinary Robinson's instrument, by which a series of type-wheels should be
acted upon so as to indicate the hourly horizontal motion of air. From these types
the results could be printed off into the log-book. The mechanical details of the
contrivance were in a great measm-e due to ]Mr. Alfred Uresswell.

  A model to indicate the principle of the instrument was exhibited.

too great a demand upon yom- time, to give even a bare outline of the more import-

open to me under sucli circumstances is to dii'ect jowx attention to the ideas wliieli

at present guide chemists in their researches, to place in a clear light the objects

they are stri^-ing to attain, and to indicate the dii-ection of scientific thought of oui-

time.  To do this  is by no  means  an easy task                                                           for the more manifold  and diver-

sified the objects of a science become, the more numerous and extensive its rela-

tions with other branches of knowledge, the more difficult it becomes to di'aw a

picture of its actuiil condition.

   It is always an excellent recommendation of a theory or hj-pothesis when

amongst the cidtivators of the science to which it pertains very little difierence of

opinion exists as regards its admissibility and scientific value. This is in a high

degree the case with regard to the atomic theory. The vast majority of chemists,

I believe, accept this theory as the most suitable exponent of the fimdamental

truths of their science; and certainly if the quality of the tree may be judged by

its fruit there is no other view which furnishes a clearer image to om- minds of the

chemical constitution of bodies, and at the same time conducts to the discovery of so

many important facts and relations. According to Daltou's profound h^'pothesis all

bodies are supposed to be composed of atoms of infinitely small dimensions. But

these atoms are supposed not to be single ; two or more of them are held together

by certain forces and thus constitute what is called a molecule. One atom of carbon,

one atom of calcium, and three atoms of oxygen, joined together by the force called

chemical affinity, constitute a molecide of carbonate of lime. Vast numbers of

such molecules bound to each other by the force of cohesion form a visible piece of

chalk. If a chemist wishes to examine a body, his first endeavour is to ascertain

of what sort of atoms the body is formed. This is a mere matter of experiment.

He next determines how many of such atoms are contained in each molecide of
the body, and finally he ascertains how these atoms are arranged, or, more correctly,

combined within the molecule ; for it is quite clear that a substance like saltpetre,

which contains one atom of nitrogen, one of potassium, and three of oxygen, may

have these atoms an-anged in very difterent manners and stiU have the same com-

Weposition.  might assume the potassium and nitrogen in more intimate union,

nearer to each other than they are to oxygen, or we might consider nitrogen and

oxygen more closely packed together, and, so to speak, attached as a whole to the

potassium ; in both cases, saltpeti-e would have in each molecule the same number
of atoms, and the weight of the molecule would be the same. The three determi-

nations just mentioned are of fundamental importance to the chemist; not that

such iuqiuries are the only ones which interest him, for we shall in the sequel

notice others of almost equal importance.

Nor must it be supposed that questions of this nature are of quite a modern date

for Leucippus, .500 B.C., appears to have sought to explain the nature of things by

the assumption that they are formed by the union of small particles, which latter re-

ceived the name of atoms from Epicm-us. It is true the notion of atoms as conceived

by the Grecian philosophers is not quite the same as ours, but their specidations
contain our notions pretty much in the same way as the acorn contains the oak tree.

The determination of the quality of the atoms in a molecule, or the analysis of

the latter, has not undergone many changes during the last few j-eiirs, and the same
may be said about the fiiiding of the relative weight of a moleciile, or the determi-

nation of the number of atoms which are contained in it. With regard to the latter
point, however, it may be mentioned that Avogadro's hypothesis, according to

which equal volumes of gaseous substances, measured at the same temperatiu-e and

pressm'e, contain the same number of moleciUes, grades us chiefly in assigning to
each molecule its relative weight and its number of atoms ; this hjTjOthesis has
won more and more the confidence of chemists, and it is now admitted to hold

good in nearly all well-examined cases.

Om" \dews relative to the combinations of atoms in molecules, and our methods

of ascertaining this arrangement, have, however, undergone gTeat alterations and
received great additions during the last ten or fifteen years. To a consideration of
these changes I vnll now, for a short time, invite yom* attention. Since our modern

views, however, originated in a great measure from the study of organic bodies, and

since the majority of chemists now devote their time and labour thereto, I shall
confine my remarks principally to the organic branch of the subject.

   Eighteen j-ears ago I'rofessor Williamson read before the members of this Asso-
ciation a remarkable paper which contained the germ of our modern chemical views,

and was the cause of many important discoveries. He proposed to regard three

large classes of bodies, acids, bases, and salts from the same point of view, and to
compare their chemical properties ^\ith those of a single selected substance. For

this term of comparison he chose water. Now water is composed of three atoms,

two of hycb'ogen and one of oxygen. Williamson showed that all oxygen acids, all
oxygen bases, and the salts resulting from a combination of the two can, like water,
be considered to be composed of three parts or radicals, two of the radicals playing

Potassic hydrate is water which has one of its atoms of hydrogen replaced by an

atom of potassium, hydric nitrite is water which has one atom of hydrogen replaced

by nitric oxide, and potassic nitrite is water with one of its hydrogen atoms re-

placed by nitric oxide and the other by potassium. This speculation, as every

chemist knows, is well supported by experiments ; it embraces three large classes

of bodies which till then had been considered as distinct. M. CTcrhardt, in 1853,

extended Williamson's views by distinguishing two other types of molecidar

structure, represented respectively hj hydrogen and ammonia, and succeeded, by

help of the radical theory, in arranging the niaiority of the then known substances

under one or the other of the three t^^-pes alreacly mentioned.

Like everj' theory which is in harmony with experience, the above considerations

led to results of unexpected importance                                                                                                                                                     for it soon  became  apparent that the ra-

in one molecule of water, and carbonic oxide, C 0, two atoms of hydrogen in one

molecule of water. Nitric oxide (N 0) is therefore said to be equivalent to one

atom of hydrogen, and carbonic oxide (C 0) equi-^alent to two atoms of hydrogen.

The radical of phosphoric acid [P 0] is found to be equivalent to three atoms of

hydrogen. Professor Odling was one of the first to observe this ditlerence in the

equivalence of atoms and gi-oups of atoms, or compound radicals, as they are tenned,

a difference which he marks as shown in the following examples :

   The notion of equivalence enabled Professor Kekul^ to form most interesting

speculations on the constitution of organic bodies, and to explain the relation be-

tween composition and equivalence of such radicals as methyl, C H3, ethyl, C, Hj,
methylene, C H^, ethylene, C'^Hj, and acetylene, CoHj.

   If from one molecule of marsh-gas, C H^, one atom of hydrogen is abstracted,
the residue, C Il.,, called methyl, can combine with an atom of hydrogen again, and
produce the original marsh-gas molecide. But methyl, inistead of combining with
an atom of hydrogen, can unite with an atom of chlorine, or an atom of bromine,

that is to sav, the place of the atom of hydrogen cau be taken by an atom of chlo-
rine or bromine. Methyl being thus equivalent to an atom of hydrogen is said to
be monovalent. If from a molecule of marsh-gas two atoms of hydrogen are re-
moved, the residue, C Hj, called methylene, can again unite with two atoms of hy_

compounds CII4, C H^ CL^, H^(J Br.^, respectively. Meth)'lene, therefore, being-

equivalent to two atoms of b ydrou'en, is termed divalent. The radical C H, left

after the abstraction of three atoms of hydrogen from marsh-gas, is able to reproduce

with three atoms of hydrogen one molecule of marsh-gas, or to combine with throe

Hatoms of chlorine, and form chloroform, C CI3. The residue, C H, is thus triva-

lent, or equivalent to three atoms of hydrogen. In tlie same manner carbon is

found to be  tetravalent or equivalent to four                             atoms of  hydrogen                                        but  carbon, for-

selves, and thus produce the so-caUed hydrocarbons, native as well as artificial.

Methyl combines with methyl and produces dimethyl, or better known as ethylic
hydride, C H.,-}-C H.,=C'2 H,, ; methylene combines with methylene and forms

ethjdene, C Ho-|-0Il2=C2 Hi. Methylene is divalent and metlijd monovalent;

therefore methylene combines with two equivalents of methyl and forms propylic

What has been said of marsh-gas also applies to ammonia and water. Ammonia,

N H3, minus one atom of hydrogen, forms the monovalent radical, N II.,, minus two

Natoms of liydrogen, the divalent radical, H, and nitrogen itself is trivalent, that is

to say, it can replace three atoms of hydrogen in compounds, or can combine with

tliree atoms of hydrogen. Water minus one atom of hydrogen produces the mo-

Hnovalent radical hydroxyl, 0, and water without both atoms of hydrogen gives
X N Hus divalent oxygen. These radicals, H2, II, N, O, and O, can combine with

each otlier, and with methyl, methylene, formen, and carbon respectively, in dif-

ferent proportions. Thus methyl, methylene, and hydroxyl are contained in com-

mon alcohol. The union of methyl, carbon, oxvgen, and hydroxyl gives acetic

acid, C,H,0.,,

to form the proximate constituents of the most important organic compounds. It

often happens that, from the union of the same radicals, two or more bodies of the

same composition, but ditlering from one another in properties, result. GlycocoU

as well as glycolamide contain the radicals methylene, hydroxyl, carbonic oxide,

and amidogen, N H,. In such cases the nature of the compound depends on tho

arrangement of the radicals, as may be seen by the following formulae :

To determinefjirsf, ichat sort of radicuh of the above nature are contained in a given

There are several ways of solving this problem. The molecule may be built up

by placing the radicals which are supposed to exist in it under suitable conditions

in contact. Two molecules of iodopropionic acid placed together with metallic silver

Awill lose their iodine, and the residues of the two molecules remain united.                                                             new

58 REPORT--1869.

  We know, therefore, tlie radicals of adipic acid and their arrangement if we

possess the same knowledge with regard to iodopropionic acid.
   The above elegant synthesis has lately been performed by Professor Wislicenus

of Ziirich. M. JBerthelot has now succeeded in producing representatives of the

principal classes of hydrocarbons from the elements of carbon and hydrogen, and
Messrs. Bauer and Verson of Vienna have prepared from amylene, C^ Hj,,, a
compound, C,o H,c, which appears to be identical with terebene, a body closely

allied to tm'peutine.

   Another way to determine the proximate constituents of molecules, is to take
the little structures to pieces, and to form a judgment of their constitution from
the radicals which thus can be extracted. This plan has been adopted by Mr.
Chapman, and described by him at one of our former Meetings.

   The more common and more reliable method for tlie determination of the
grouping of atoms in molecules is, however, the replacement of one or more of
them by atoms of another kind, and the careful examination of the properties of
the bodies thus formed. M. Gautier has recently obtained a new substance of

the same composition as acetonitrile, which he calls raethcarbylamine. According
to their formation, acetonitrile, as well as methcarbylamine, can be considered as

combinations of cyanogen and methyls CH3 ON. The two bodies, however, do

not possess the same properties ; if they are heated with potassic hydrate and
water, methcarbylamine produces formic acid and methylia, whereas the same re-
agents cause acetonitrile to form acetic acid and ammonia. Thus

                O2H3N + 2H,0 = CJIjO, + NH3

Acetonitrile.        Water.  Acetic acid.

CHaN + 211,0 = CII.O, + NJ^j^^

Methcarbylamine.             Formic acid.       Methylia.

In the first case, the radical methjd remains after the decomposition in union
with carbon, and in the second case in comljination with nitrogen. Accordingly
it is supposed that the same arrangement prevails in the undecomposed molecules,
and with this supposition all the other properties of methcarbylamine and aceto-
nitrile agree. In symbols these relations are expressed as follows :

                     =iCr^"TT methcarbylamine.
                     =[ Co H3 acetonitrile.

This case of isomerism is most interesting, inasmuch as it furnishes a most in-

structive lesson on the grouping of atoms. The homologous bodies of uieth-

carbvlamine in the etliyl and propyl series have also been obtained.

Isomerism, indeed, has received much attention during the last year, and a

great many interesting discoveries have resulted ; of these one more example

Wemay be mentioned.  know two compounds of the formula ON, H4 0, the one

is amnionic cyanate, and the other urea. Until recentlj', only one corresponding
sulphur-compound, amnionic sulphocyanate, was known. Professor Reynolds has

succeeded in obtaining the true sulphur-urea, a body isomeric to amnionic sulpho-

cyanate.

   Thus every year produces results which improve our conceptions of the atomic
and molecular constitution of bodies ; and as our knowledge improves new questions
suggest themselves, and our power over the elements increases. It has already

become possible to prepare in the laboratory bodies of a very complex character,

such as a few years ago were only found in the bodies of animals or plants.
   Alizarin, the beautiful compound of the madder root, has been obtained by arti-

ficial means in the course of the j'ear by Messrs. Liebermann and Grrebe. Results

of such a nature render it highly probable that, at no distant period, it will be in

our power to prepare artificially nearly all, if not all, the substances found in

plants and animals. Here I must not be misunderstood. Organic structures,

such as muscidar fibre or the leaves of a tree, the science of chemistry is incapable
                   TEANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                  59

of producing, but molecules like those found in a leaf or in tlie stem of a tree

will no doubt one day be manufactured from their elements.

I must not conclude this address without reference to two or three papers of

great importance.

   Professor Buusen, of Heidelberg, has published a paper on the washing of pre-

cipitates. Every one acquainted with practical chemistry knows how much time

is often lost in waiting for a liquid to pass through a filter. Bunsen found the

rate of filtration nearly proportional to the difference between the pressures on the

upper and lower surfaces of the liquid. If, accordingly, the funnel be fixed air-

tight by means of a perforated cork to the neck of a bottle, and the air exhausted

in the bottle, the liquid will run faster through the filter in proportion to the di-

minution of the pressure in the bottle. Comparative experiments, some made

according to the old, and others accordiug to the new method, showed that the fil-

tration, washing, and drying of a precipitate which took seven hours by the old

plan could be performed by filtration into an exhausted bottle in thirteen minutes,

but a saving of time is not the only advantage of the improved method of collect-

Aing and washing precipitates.  more perfect washing with less water thau is re-

quired by the common way of proceeding is by no means the least recommenda-

tion of Bunsen's ingenious method.

  A very important paper has been published by Professor Liebig on the improve-

ment of the nomishing qualities of bread. Certain quantities of phosphates and

other salts form necessaiy ingredients of wholesome food. Xow, it is well known

that most of these salts, which are naturally in wheat, remain with the husk.

Liebig proposes to add salts, of a natiu-e similar to those remaining iu the husk, to'

the flour, and at the same time to substitute for the carbonic acid developed by fer-

mentation, gas liberated from sodic carbonate. The bread prepared accordiug to

Liebig's recommendation is said to be of excellent quality, and to exceed in value

bread made by the ordinary method.

   Mr. Graham, of Her Majesty's Mint, has continued his researches on the ab-
sorption of hydi-ogen by palladium. Palladium appears to be able to absorb more
than 900 times its volume of hydrogen, and to form a combination which consists

of nearly equal equivalents of the two elements. Hydrogenium, as Mr. Graham

calls the combined hydrogen, acts in this case like a metal, and thus the opinion held
by some scientific men, that hydrogen constitutes the vapour of a metal, receives
confirmation. The specific gravity of hydrogenium, as contained in the alloy,
was found to be 1'95. These experiments are remarkable in more than one re-
spect. The palladium, which absorbs and combines with the hydrogen, does not

change its state of aggregation, but remains solid and expands "as if it had been
heated. The molecules of the palladium have consequently changed their relative
positions and combined with hydrogen, whilst the continuity of the metal re-
mained intact.

   The last paper to which I have to draw your attention is an excellent one
by Professor Tyndall, on a new method of decomposing gaseous substances by
means of light. Tyndall's experiments bring us face to face with the motions of
atoms in molecides, and the relation of these motions to chemical decomposition.
They will no doubt, at some future time, furnish valuable materials to chemical

dynamics.

On the Absorption-lands of Bile. By Thomas Andrews, M.B., F.R.S.

A solution of bile in water or alcohol exhibits, when examined by the spec-

troscope, characteristic absorption-bands, which differ from those of the red colour-

ing-matter of blood or its derivatives. The most conspicuous of these bands lies

nearly midway between the yellow soidum-line and the green line 3 calcium.

Another band occurs, chiefly in the orange, extending a little beyond the sodium-
Aline.
        third band occm-s in the green, bounded on its more refrangible side by

the magnesium group (J, Fraunhofer). These absorption-bands are also found in

solutions of bili\-erdin, but not in solutions of the yellow colouring-matter of bile.

They are not affected by reducing agents, but are weakened, and at last effaced by

the action of nitric acid.
60 KEPORT--1869.

   The fibsoi'ption-bands fiu'uisli a ready test for bile iu liquids, such as water or
urine, which have no absorption -hands of their own. With a column of liquid
2i inches long, the presence of bile was in this way discovered, when diluted 100
times, and with a column 8 inches long, when the dilution was carried fom- times

further. An estimate of its amount may also be made, and its fluctuations in

disease observed from day to day.

   The water supplied to the town of Plymouth is taken near Sheepstor, from the
River Meavy, which receives its water" from the granite-hills iu the neighbour-
hood, and has a drainage area of about 4000 acres.

   The water is conducted from the river by means of an open leat as far as
Knaekerskuowle, a distance of about 12 miles, from thence the water for do-
mestic use is carried through iron pipes of 24 inches and 12 inches diameter, a
further distance of about three miles into reservoirs, from whence it is distributed

to the different parts of the town.
   The surplus water is carried from Knackerslniowle by the old leat around a

distance of about 10 miles, to supply several mills, and is then delivered into the
Gre.at Western Docks at Milbay, The supply of the water is in the hands of the

Corporation.

   Analyses of samples of the water, taken at the commencement of the leat at
Sheepstor, and in Plymouth, gave the following results. It was perfectly clear,
transparent, and colourless, and contained in an imperial gallon :--

   Devonport Supply. The water supplied to Devonport is taken from streams
near the source of the River Dart, on Dai'tmoor, including one stream which
would be much better excluded ; for, as its name (Blackwater or Blackabrook) indi-
cates, its water is highly colom-ed \sith peat, and colours the water of the Devon-

port leat.

   The water is carried nearly all the way, a distance of 34 miles, in an open leat.
Some portion of the water, however, is detained at Knaekerskuowle, and from
thence is delivered through iron pipes into a reservoir at Stoke, to supply the
higher levels, but the largest portion is delivered into Devonport from the leat

 direct.

    I took a sample of the water from the leat at Downsland Barn, and also a

sample in Devonport, as supplied to the Company's own offices. On analj^sis the

samples gave the following results.

water on the pipes also removed, as usual, a considerable quantity of the organic

matter.

   This water, like the Plymouth water, is exceedingly soft, and on this account is
admirably adapted for culinary and manufacturing pui-poses ; but from the pre-

sence of "the colouring-matter," it is not so agreeable for drinking purposes as the

Plymouth water.

These very soft waters always rapidly corrode the iron pipes, not so mucli

by deposition from the water, as by converting the iron of the pipes into o.iide
of iron, pipes of 12 inches diameter becoming, after a few years, reduced to 10
inches in diameter. These waters also act on freshly cut lead.

 --Rveter Stipphj. Tlie water used lor the supply of Exeter is taken from the river

Exe, at Upton Pines, about two miles and a half above Exeter. The water is

pumped from there to the reservoirs and filter-beds at the back of the County

Prison in Exeter, from whence it is distributed to the town, but the water used to
supply the higher levels is frequently pumped directly from the river to the

houses, without filtration. I took a sample of the water at the house of PI. S.
Ellis, Esq., the present Mayor of Exeter, from the tap as it was running from

the main into his cistern; the water was red with rust of iron, and depo.?ited a

considerable quantity of earthy matter on standing.

I also afterwards obtained a sample of the water of the Exe, above the entrance

of the river Culm, from the spot whence the future supply is to be taken.

Analyses of these two samples gave the following results.

After all sedimentary matter had been allowed to deposit, the clear water was

   The inorganic constituents consisted of carbonate of calcium, sulphate of calcium,
carbonate of magnesium, chloride of sodium, nitrates, and a little oxide of iron.

   It is evident, from the large quantity of chloride of sodium, nitrates, and
organic matter in this water, that it is obtained from a well which receives sur-
face-drainage, and on this account, as well as from its hardness, is not a fit supply

for domestic use.

  A considerable portion of the district is still supplied by the Exeter "Water

Company.

               On the Decomposition of Carhonic O.vide hij Spongy Iron.
                                  Bij I. LowTui\N Eeli., F.C.S.

   In a communication on the chemistry of the blast-furnace, made to the Chemi-
cal Society of London last June, the author mentioned a circumstance in con-
nexion with the action of iron on carbonic oxide, which, so far as he knows, had

not previously been observed.

   On exposing fragments of ironstone, either raw or calcined, containing in the
one case FeO CO^, and in the other Fe^ 0.,, to the escaping gases of blast-fumaces,
there was, when the current of heated gas had a temperature sufficiently elevated,

an impregnation of black matter, which was ascertained to be carbon.
   The heat required to produce a slight appearance of this change was apparently

a little above that of melting lead, but at that of melting zinc the deposition of
carbon was very marked.

   The explanation ventured iipon at the time was, that the oxide of carbon was
resolved into carbon and carbonic acid, even at the low temperature of 337° to

3G1° C, as may be expressed by the formula 2CO = C4-C02.

   It has since been suggested that the action in question might have been caused
by traces of hydrocarbons still existing in the coke employed in the sraelting-

process.

   To satisfy himself that this explanation was not the correct one, the author has,
upon several occasions, repeated in the laboratorj^ the decomposition performed by
the blast-fm-nace, employing carbonic oxide, prepared both from oxalic acid and
from ferrocyanide of potassium, iu the usual way.

   The author was induced to submit the results of these experiments to the
Association, not only from the interest thc^^ may have in a chemical point of view,
but iilso from the circumstance that it is, from recent observation, possible that
the decomposition of carbonic oxide at this low temperature may have a practical

value in the smelting of iron.

   To prevent the reactions which accompany the deoxidation of an iron-ore compli-
cating the inquiry, a quantity of calcined Cleveland ironstone was reduced to a

coarse powder, and the oxygen expelled. It was first exposed in a mnltie to a

red heat for some hours in a current of air, so as to secure its perfect oxidation,
and removal of every trace of organic matter. The powdered ore was then placed
in a red-hot porcelain tube, and a stream of hydrogen gas passed over it imtil all
the oxygen of the peroxide of iron was removed. The completeness of the de-
oxidation was judged of by weighing the water produced by the operation.

  A quantity of carbonic oxide, in this instance prepared from ferrocyanide of

potassium, was examined, and its freedom from water, carbonic acid, oxygen,
and other impurity carefully seciu'ed by passing it successively through a series of
tubes containing pyrogallate of soda, potash, and sulphuric acid.

  =Two himdred' grains ( 12-9598 grammes) of the deoxidized ore were placed in

a glass combustion tube, and heated by a Hofmann's gas-lamp, so that the neces-

sary temperature was under easy control.
   Ten litres of the carbonic oxide were passed over the ore, which was never per-

mitted to be red-hot, and to secure the temperatm-e being high enough, a piece of
zinc placed on the tube was maintained in a melted state. Four hours and a quar-

ter were required for the operation.

   The gas, as it passed away, was exposed to the action of a solution of potash,
which of course absorbed any carbonic acid generated, and which was found to

amoimt to 9-9 grains (=0'641 gi-amme).
   The ore on cooling, without exposure to the atmosphere, was ascertained to

=have increased 3 grains (=0-1942 gramme). The 203 grains ( 13-155 grammes)

thus obtained were mixed -with chromate of lead, placed in a tube, and heat

applied.

   The resulting carbonic acid was collected in the usual way. It weighed 10-G6

=grains (=0-G903 grm.) equal to 2-907 gi-ains ( 0-1882 gmi.) of carbon.

    This experiment then gives 9-9 grains (=0-641 gramme) of carbonic acid, pro-
duced directly by the action, and 10-66 grains (=0-6903 gramme) obtained by
the deposited carbon, the difference being probably due to error of manipulation.

    In another form of experiment 1000 cubic centimetres of carbonic oxide were

passed and repassed from one graduated vessel over the heated ore into another

similar vessel (both over mercmy ), so that the change of composition, as denoted
by the change in volume, could be ascertained. It was found in this experiment
and in others that, as the temperatm-e was raised above that of redness, the action
gi-adually diminished. At a heat approaching whiteness the carbonic acid obtained
from the ore which had been exposed for some hoiu's to the action of carbonic oxide

 was so minute (-25 per cent of the weight of the ore) as to render it probable that
it was due to the occlusion of a portion of the oxide of carbon, a view which was
 confirmed by the fact that no flakes of carbon were perceptible on dissolving the

 ore in hydrochloric acid.

   When the treatment is continued long enough, the deposition of carbon in the

 interstices of some pieces of the ore is so copious that they are burst open as lime is

with water on being slaked. Upon one occasion the ore was found, after nine

 hours' exposure, to contain 24 per cent, of its weight of carbon.

On Extraction of Ammonia from Gas-Liquor. By Feebeeick Beaby, F.C.S.

   Gas-liquor was formerly a drug in the market and a ntusance to the manufac-
tm-er ; it was given away to any one that would use it, now it is the principal

source of ammonia and of its salts. The object of this paper is to show how the
demand for gas-liquor, which far exceeds the supply, can be met, and to prove how
(by reduction of bulk for transit) small and remote gas-works may export their
residual products at a profit ; it is also to show how the production of ammonia
may be very greatly increased.

   In its crude state, gas-liquor usually contains one part of ammonia, by weight,
to eighty parts of liquor. For all purposes of transit, a very serviceable solution
would contain one part, by weight, of ammonia to four parts of water ; this veiy
considerable reduction of bulk is effected by means of a rapid and economical

process, described in the specification of a patent recently secured by the author,

in conj miction with Mr. Baggs.
                                                                             ;

64 UEPORT-- 18G9.

According to this process, a quantity of slaked lime is added to the ordinary

p-as-liquor. Tliis is maintained at a temperature of between 100° and 200° F.,

Athe liquid being constantly stirred.  powerfid air-blast, blown continuously

through the liquor, liberates the ammonia as gas in a very perfect and rapid

manner. The mixture of air and ammonia passes through water, leaving the

ammonia in solution, and the air passes off. With a very moderate-sized ap-

paratus, several thousand gallons of gas-liquor may thus be converted into a

portable form in a single day. Amnionic sulphate, or amnionic chloride,_ is ob-

tained by conducting the amnioniacal gas into sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid

respectively.

In the working plant at Deptford, constructed by the author, a wrought-iron

still, or ammonia-generator, 30 feet long and G feet diameter, is capable of being

charged from a reservoir that can contain over 9000 gallons of gas-liquor. The

gas-liquor is pumped from the reservoir into the still, and heat is applied by

means of an underneath fire. Air is forced into the hot liquor through suitable

apertures in the lower part of cast-iron pipes that proceed longitudinally through

the still at its bottom. The streams of air are thoroughly disseminated through

the liquor by the fans of a revolving stirrer. The various constituents of the gas-

liquor (water, ammonia, carbonic dioxide, sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphocyanides,

&c.) are thus brought continuously into intimate contact with air and with

lime that has been placed in the ves'sel. The mixture of air and ammonia passes

into a purifier, which consists of a small wooden vessel containing lime, and

about one-third full of water. This pm'ifier has a tight head and a perforated

false bottom, also a small agitator, together with trial-taps and a pipe for con-

veying away liquid accumulated from condensed vapour. The other adjuncts

are a " safety- tube," safety-valve, and vacuum-valve ; the two latter are_ fixed on

tlie tube from the ammonia-generator. After passing through the purifier, the

mixture of ammoniacal gas and air traverses a coil (in a cold-water cistern) to a
Adeep closed vessel, or receiver, about one-third full of pure cold water._
                                                                             series

of these receivers is used, so as to attbrd a succession of vessels to retain the am-

monia. The air, ha^ving fulfilled its function, passes oft' into the atmosphere. The

last receiver contains a strong solution of ferric chloride. The liquid rcsiduuni of

this process is run off" into a draining pit, thence into the sewers ; the solid in-

odorous lime-compounds are carted away. In the draining-pit certain perforated

shelves carrying sand, also gravel and cement, facilitate the separation of the solid

from the liquid parts of the residuum.
   The commercial value of the ammoniacal liquor augments in a ratio increasing

with its concentration. The advantages of the above-dcscrilied system may be

summed up as eflecting a considerable economy in labour, time, and occupation
in plant, together Avith a facility of extracting the whole of the ammonia from the

gas-liquor in a pure condition.

On the llegistration of Atmospheric Ozone hi the Sonlhct)/ Prisktenc;/, and the
   chief Causes which influence its apj)reeiahle amount in the Atmosphere. Bij

  Dr. H. Cook, F.G.S., F.R.G.S., Surgeon H.M. Bomhety Army, Me Mete-

    oroloyist to the Abyssinian Expedition.

   The registration of ozone -tvas commenced in the Bombay Presidency by the

direction of the Government, at the author's suggestion. In the year 1863 at the

following stations, viz. Ahmedabad, Deesa, and Mhow in the northern division

Ahmednugger, Poonah, and Sattara in the Dekkan ; Belgaum and Kholapore in
the southe'i-n JIahratta country ; Bombay, Tanna, and Surat on the coast ; at Kur-
rachee and Ilydrabad in Sciude ; and at Mahablesliwur, the Sanatorium^ on the

·western Ghats.

   Previous to this no systematic observations had been made in India.
   Printed forms, whicli when filled in would embody the following details, were
issued to the various stations, viz. the quantity of ozone by day and by night,
the direction of the wind, character of the clouds, amount of rainfall, occurrence
of dust-stiu-ms, thunder-storms, I'cc. : a summary of the temperature, and the daily

number of cases in hospital suffering from cholera, dysentery, diarrhoea, and inter-

mittent fever.

   These forms were filled in and forwarded monthly to the author, who prepared an

annual report on the whole.

   The results (to state them as briefly as possible) of the four years' registration
go to prove that practically the same conditions of atmosphere are present in
India as in Europe when the full manifestation of atmospheric ozone is present.

Elevation above the sea-level, the prevalence of the equatorial current, proximity
to the ocean, and prevalence of sea breeze, a certain amount of moisture, the fall
of rain, hail, and dew, the occurrence of thunder-storms and dust columns, or other
indications of excited electrical conditions, all influence the evolution of ozone
alike in India as elsewhere. Thus at the station of Mahableshwur, vrhich is

4500 feet above the sea, the daily mean average of ozone is 7 of the scale. At
Belgaum, in the southern Mahratta country, and at Poonah and Sattara in the

Delikan, at heights from 1500 to 2000 feet above the sea-level, the average is from

43 to 5-5, while in the northern division (the mean distance from the sea of the

three stations which it includes being 194 miles) the average falls slightly below

2'0 of the scale.

   During the prevalence of the S.W. winds and the rainfall of the monsoon
season, while the great equatorial cun'ent is sweeping up from the ocean to the
south, high averages are obtained, varying from 3'5 to 5-3 as a mean for all
stations ; but during the pre'^'alence of the north-easterly or polar current, from

November to March inclusive, the average monthly mean falls to 26 or 29.

   The influence of these winds on the presence of atmospheric ozone is shown in
the Table, where the returns of four consecutive years are grouped.

of low ozone readings, t. e. readings below the average of the particular months or

total absence of ozone, as indicated by the test-paper, in the majority of cases it
was a relative deficiency that was most apparent, a decrease of ozone numbers below
the level of the normal quantities of those particular periods.

   The depression of the ozone-curves during these two years of epidemic cholera,
as compared with the curve of the following years, is more decidedly marked if we
consider it in reference to the mean-level line aflbrded by the results of the four

years' registration.

   In the year 1864 the numbers of stations in which this condition was present,
from the "m )nth of February to the month of July inclusive, were consecutively
1, 3, 4, 6, 3, 2, thus amounting in the month of May'to 6 out of the fifteen stations
while in the following year the numbers rose to nine-tenths, in the month of Jime,
of the whole number of stations imder review.

   The cone formed by the ozone-ciu-ve of this year was thus seen to be proportion-
ately small, extending only tlrrough part of June, July, and August in breadth,

and to the level of 46 in height; while that of the following year, in which there
was little or no epidemic cholera prevalent, extends from May to October in

breadth and to 6-2 in height.

   The author said that the result of various experiments he had made was that
100 parts of cotton-fibre yield, when repeatedly washed with water, a quantity of
acid phosphate of magnesia. Both husks and seeds also yield certain proportions,
and these results show that the phosphates exist in much larger quantity in the

kinds sliow that whilst the flour contains only a trace of phosphates, especially

soluble ones, the bran contains a large quantity. These facts tend to prove that
the phosphates and the mineral matters contained in wheat are not combined with
the organic matter, but are in a free condition. Other investigations go to prove
that although habit and pride have gradually led us to prefer white bread to brown,

yet this is an error when we consider the nutritious properties of wheat, especially

as food for children, phosphates being essential for the formation of bone and blood.

    On the Electro-deposition of Iron*. By H. M. Jacobi, Member of the

                      Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg.

   The fact that it is possible to deposit iron by means of electricity has long been
known, but the process has hitherto been beset with many difficulties. The author
has, however, completed a long series of experiments with M. E. Klein of St. Peters-
burg, the result of which proves that iron may be very readily deposited from a
solution of a double salt, the protosulphate of iron, combined with sidphate of
magnesia, ofteriug great facility for the deposition of iron. The solution shoidd be
as neutral as possible, and the strength of the current so adjusted that very little
hydrogen is developed.

 --Nature of the Iron. Electro-deposited iron is hard, almost sufficiently so to scratch

glass, and it is somewhat brittle, but by annealing (particularly in hydrogen) it
becomes malleable, soft, and silver-white.

   It shares with palladium the power of occluding hydrogen. By heating the

deposited iron in vacuo seventeen to twenty times its volume of hydrogen gas was

extracted.

   The specific weight is 7'675 ; after annealing it increases and becomes 7'811, equal

to that of the best forged iron.

          Sur le Spectre de la vapeur d'eau. Par M. Dr. Janssen.

Mes etudes sur le spectre de la vapeur d'eau ont 6te continuees.

Pour identifier les raies de la vapeur d'eau dans le spectre solaire, j'ai fait passer

un faisceau de lumiere solaire dans le tube de 37 metres qui contenait la vapeur, et

a cote du tube, im second faisceau. Ces deux faisceaux etaient re9us dans un meme

spectroscope et leurs spectres etaient superposes. Toutes les raies du spectre dues

a la vapeur d'eau etant beaucoup plus foncees dans le spectre correspoudant a la

lumiere qui avait traverse le tube, on pouvait obtenir facilement la distinction.

   Les raies du spectre solaire dues a la vapeur d'eau sont extremement nombreuses.

D ADe a t, leur nombre est decuple des raies solaires proprement dites.

Ceci montre combien une atmosphere est transparente pour la lumiere ultra-violette,
et explique comment les phenomenes photographiques sontsi iufluenc6s par la pre-

sence de la vapeur d'eau dans I'atmosphere. Ou soit, par example, que dans I'apres-

midi, la puissance photogenique diminue rapidement Ceci s'explique d'apres les
observations ci-dessus, en remarquant que I'eau dissoute dans notre atmosphere

augmente a mesure que le soleil s'eleve sur I'horizon. En general, abstraction faite

des modifications apportees par les vents, la quantity de vapeur doit etre la plus
grande vers 2 et 3 heures de I'apres-midi, et alors le soleil baisse rapidement; les
deux causes concourent done pour amener une diminution tres-prompte du pouvoir
photogenique de la lumiere solaire. Le matin, avant que la chaleur solaire ait eu
le temps de vaporiser toute I'eau repandue a la sm-face de la terre, la puissance pho-
tographique doit etre la plus grande, et c'est en effet ce que I'experience confirme.

    Si I'atmosphere seche est transparente, d'apres ces observations, pour la lumiere
violette et ultra-violette, elle Test egalement pour la chaleur obscure. Ainsi, a
Simla, j'aipu constater, par des'experiencespyrheliometriques, que le rayonnement
calorifique du soleil augmente beaucoup avec la secheresse de I'atmosphere, toutes
choses egales d'ailleurs, sous le rapport de la purete de Fair, de I'eleTation de la

Note sur une nouvelle Miihodepour la recherche de la Soucle et des composes du
                Sodium 'par VAnalyse Spectrale. Par M. Dr. Janssen.

   On salt que la recherche de la soude pr^sente, en analyse spectrale, des diflicult^s

tres-grandes qui tiennent a ce que la raie du sodium se retrouve danspresque toutes
les flammes, en raison de la presence presque constante du sel marin dans I'atmo-

sphere.

    Or, ou peut lever facilement cette difficulte en employant, au lieu d'une flarame

tres-chaude et fort peu eclairante comme celle de Bunsen, une flamme tres lumi-
neuse comme celle d'un bee de gaz ordinaire dans la partie la plus brillante.

   En efFet, tandis qa'on aper^oit presque toujours la raie du sodium dans la partie

bleue et transparente de la flamme d'un bee de gaz, on ne I'aperfoit plus dans la
partie la plus lumineuse a cause de I'abondanee des rayons qui avoisinent la raie du
sodium dans cette region.

    Voici done la maniere d'op^rer.

   On dirigera le spectroscope sur la partie brillante de la flamme de maniere a

obtenir un spectre brillant et continu dans lequel la raie du sodium u'apparaisse pas
sensiblement. Ou prendra un fil de platine qui aura Ste prealablement port^ au
rouge dans une flamme pendant quelques minutes, pour le debarrasser de toute
poussiere saline, et avec ce til on portera ime goutte de la solution a essayer, dans la

flamme du spectroscope. En cet instant,' si la liqueur contient un compose du

Dsodium r(?ductible par la flamme, la raie apparaitre immediatement.

   On peut rendre aussi peu apparente qu'on voudra la raie du sodium en employant
les parties les plus brillantes des flammes, ou meme en pla^ant outre le spectroscope

Det la flamme d essai, une ou deux flammes auxiliaires qui rendront la raie encore

moins perceptible. Dans ce demier cas, il faudrait employer du sel en assez grande

Dquantite dans la flamme d'essai pour voir apparaitre la raie dans le spectroscope.

Si au contraire, la liqueur ou le corps a essayer contient fort peu du compose sodt?,
pn pourra employer une partie plus transparente de la flamme. Dans tons les cas,
il sera prudent de faire des experiences comparatives avec les fils de platine et de
I'eau distillee pour s'assurer que les raies qui apparaissent sont bien dues a la sub-

stance qu'on analyse.
   Je continue ce sujet, et j'espere arriver a une analyse quantitative des substances

a analyser.

   The experimental observations which form the basis of the present communica-

gas obtained from certain mixtures of cannel-coals as contrasted with the gas dis-
tilled from the coals taken separately. The coals selected for examination by de-
structive distillation were sixteen in number, and they comprehended examples ot

the larger coal-fields in Scotland. The experiments were conducted in a small gas-
work attached to the laboratory of the author, and connected with fully equipped
photometric apparatus. The quantity of coal experimented upon at a time was six

pounds, and the volume of gas vielded therefrom amounted to about thirty cubic
feet. Every possible care was taken to keep the retorts at a imiform temperature

during the course of the trials, and the testing of the same coal on several occa-

sions showed that such was practicallv done.   the  quantity  and             ,·      i?  gas  ob-

On Aceto-sulphuric Acid. By A. Oppenheim, Ph.D.

The subject of this note forms part of researches on the action of sulphuric

acid on organic chlorides "with which the author has been occupied for some

time. The mouochlorinated hydrocarbons generally exchange their chlorine for

HSO^. AVhen they are non-saturated, then either a second molecule of PLSOj is

added to the compound so formed, as is the case witli C3 H, CI, mouochlorinated

propylene, which forms C.^ 11,, (HSOJ,, decomposed by water into acetone and

sulphuric acid, or one molecule of sulphuric acid is added to the non-saturated chloride

without any separation of hydrochloric acid, as is the case with chloride of allyle.

The latter is thus transformed into C, Hg CI HSO^, which with water yields mo-

nochlorhydrine of propylic glycol.

Hydrocarbons with more than one atom of chlorine are generally decomposed

entirely, and carbonized by the action of suli^huric acid. The chlorobenzole,

CHCpH- CHCl,, however, is entirely and easily transformed into Cgll,                                  (JISO,),,

which with water jdeld the theoretical quantity of oil of bitter almonds. Most

oxygenated chlorides are very easily attacked by sulphuric acid. They either

combine directly, as does epichlorhydrine, or they yield hydrochloric acid, as is the

case with the chlorhydrine of glycol, C^ 11, CI Oil, which thus forms the acid

nCj ,0H SO4, formerly obtained in a ditierent way by Dr. Maxwell Simpson.

The chlorides of acid radicals, such as chloride of acetyle or of benzoyl, give very

energetic reactions as sulphuric acid, streams of hydrochloric acid being evolved

as soon as the two stibstances are brought into contact. It appears probable at

first sight that the results of this reaction are the t^\ anhydrides of the acetic and

the sulphmic acids, according to the equation

+2 C, II3 OCl II, SO, = C, H,0 o^go^ ^ , jj(..
                                                                                                   j

Such is, however, not the case ; one molecule of each substance entering into the

reaction thus,

                   +C2 II3 OCl H2 SO, = HCl -\- G, H,, SO,PI.

The resulting substance is half anhydride, half acid. The aceto-sulphuric acid or
acid anhydride is decomposed at about 180"C., and cannot therefore be distilled.
"Water decomposes it into the two acids.

    In following out these researches, the author intends to study the action of sul-
phuric acid on other oxygenated and nitrogenized chlorides.

On Bromo-iodide of Mercw'y . By A.. Ovves'sei'h, Ph.D.

Iodide of allyle and bichloride of mercury', when mixed in alcoholic or ethereal

solutions, form at once a red precipitate of" iodide of mercury, while the iodide of

Whenallyle is transformed into the ililoride.  bibroniide of n'lercury is substituted

for the bichloride the reaction is somewhat changed. No iodide of mercury is then

precipitated, but in course of time yellow crystals separate out, which are parti-

cularly fine, when acetone is taken "for dissolving the two substances brought into

contact with each other. Most other organic iodides may be substituted for the

allylic iodide, those of amyle or etliyle for instance. Tlie reaction is, however,
slower in these cases, and sometimes requires an elevation of temperature. The
crystals mentioned contain no organic substance ; they are freely soluble in ether,
and show exactly the composition of one atom of bromine and one atom of iodide
for one atom of mercury. They form rhombic prisms exactly isomoi'phous with
the yellow unstable modification of biniodide of mercury. Dr. Grothe found the angle

otp : ju=114° 25', while for the yellow iodide Mitscherlich determined ^ : />=114°,

=the corresponding angle in the bibromide being lll° 2G'. The angular differences

of the three isomorphous compounds do not therefore correspond exactly with their
chemical differences.

    It is quite evident that this iodo-bromide is not an isomorphous mixtiire, but a
chemical individual, although the author has not been able as yet to give the most
decisive proof of it by taking the vapour-density of the compound, its boiling-point
being considerably higher than that of mercury this being also the case with the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

biiodide and bibromide of mercury. The bromo-iodide is, however, a very stable
compound. It may be sublimed without breaking up into the bromide and iodide

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and what appears decisive, its melting-point lies just in the middle between the

fusing-points of the bromide and of the iodide, viz. at 229'C.

  The fusing-point of Hg Br, is situated between 222° and 223°C., and that of Hg I^

at 238°. The latter compound is transformed into its yellow modification between
148° and 154°, the bromo-iodide shows no such changes. Lastly, it should be
remarked that when the quantity of bibromide of mercury acted upou by the or-

ganic iodide is insufficient to produce the reaction described,

                   =C3 H, I+Hg Br, C3 H, Br-hHg I Br,

then crystals of red iodide of mercurj' are formed at the same time, but never any in-

termediate bromo-iodides, save the one described. Its existence may therefore be
fairly taken as an additional proof for the atomic weight of mercmy, such as it is
now generally accepted.

   The author has been particularly careful to ascertain the complete absence of bro-
mine in the crystals of iodide of mercury formed along with it, because they show a
peculiarity not hitherto observed. The red crystals, although belonging to the tetra-
gonal system, show the phenomenon of double refraction, but this evidently only in
consequence of a certain pressure they were subjected to in the mother-liquor from
which they crj'stallized. The reaction described is by no means the only one

which engenders the bromo-iodide of mercury. When coiTesponding quantities of
Hg Br, and Hg I, are dissolved in acetone, the same compound will crystallize

out ; as also when iodine is added to an acetonic solution of the bibromide.

periments was, that in the above conditions all these different waters attacked and

dissolved lead, union metal (an alloy of lead, antimony, and tin), copper, and per-

haps zinc. The method of experiment consisted in placing some 5 to 10 gi-ammes

of the metal, cut into small pieces, into a pint stoppered bottle, three-fourths full

of the water to be tested. The whole was submitted to violent shaking for about

36 hours ; the liquid was then filtered through the finest Swedish filtering paper,

                          On a Specimen of Obsidian from Java.

                 By "WiiLiAM Chandler Egberts, F.C.S., F.O.S.

   This paper, which was illustrated by numerous di'awings and microscopical
specimens, was intended to demonstrate the extreme importance of microscopical
examination of rocks and minerals.

   The specimen of obsidian was from Java, but the exact locality is unknown.
   Examination with a 1-inch objective revealed the presence of three distinct
minerals. These were diopside, orthoclase,and magnetic iron. Each of these was
beautifully crystallized. The optical properties of the orthoclase crystals were
minutely given, but without drawings it is impossible to describe them here.
   The obsidian contained fluid-cavities, but unlike many specimens of obsidian
from other localities, it was free fi-om occluded gas.

                                                 On Jargonia *. By H. C. Soebt, F.R.S.

I herewith send for exhibition at the Chemical Section what I believe to be

nearly pure zirconia and jargonia, prepared by a modified combination of the

methods described by Mr. David Forbes and myself. You will notice at once

that the zu-conia is perfectly white, whereas the jargonia is of a clear straw-colour.

This exactly corresponds with the difference between the opaque borax blowpipe

beads heated to redness, as described in my paper in the ' Proceedings of the
Eoyal Society,' and I am strongly inclined to believe that it is a characteristic

peculiarity. At first I thought it might be due to the presence of a small quantity

of iron, since zirconia containing a little of this peroxide is of a similar yellow

colour. When, however, that is digested in sulphide of ammonium it quickly

turns to a deep green colour, whereas this yellow jargonia does not turn at all

green. Subsequent experiments may show that the colour is due to some other

substance                                        but, taking  all  the  facts  now known                                       into      consideration, it  seems ex-
                                              ;

tremely probable that, after ignition, jargonia is of a clear straw-coloui-, paler than

that of timgstic acid, but deeper than that of ceroso-ceric oxide.

On raising a Temperature higher than 212° F. in certain Solutions by Steam
                           of 212° F. By Peter Spence.

Some twelve to fifteen years ago the author had occasion to require large masses

of liquor to be raised to a temperature of 228° Fahr. (108°-8 C), for the purpose of

extracting, by means of long-continued digestion at that temperature, alumina in the

form of sulphate of alumina from minerals containing that earth. As time was an

element of importance in his calculations, the author's aim was to heat the liquors

as rapidly as possible, but lead vessels only could be used with the acid liquors, and

as it was requisite to have an iron outside vessel next the fire, the heating was a
tedious operation. To overcome this loss of time, the author fitted up a digestino-

vessel so as to raise the heat rapidly to 212° F. (100° C), by injecting steam from

a steam-boiler into the                                       mass  of liquor                                          and as  soon  as  he had obtained that tem-
                                                                                                                    ;

perature he stopped off" the steam and allowed the external fire to operate alone, so

as to raise the additional 16° F. (8°-8 C.) required, and to maintain the temperature

at 228° F. (108°-8 C), his impression being that above 212° F. (100° C.) the steam,

if kept on, would act as a cooling agent and prevent the temperature rising. The

combined operation was perfectly successful and went on for some time, acting, as

the author supposed, in accordance with his preconceived theory; but s'ome

circumstances led him subsequently to doubt whether it was so. He foxmd that if

inadverteutly both steam and fire were left acting after tlie higher temperature was
obtained, the temperature continued notwithstanding. Again, when the fire was
in a condition, through neglect, in which it was obviously of no use, the author was
still astonished to find that, as the apparent result of the steam alone, the tempera-
ture was at a satisfactory point. This last observation led the author to test the
matter in the laboratory in the following manner. Being convinced that the high
boiling-point of his liquors had something to do with the phenomenon, he selected
a solution of a salt (nitrate of soda) ha\-iDg a high boiling-point, about 250° F.
(121°'l C). The nitrate of soda was placed in a vessel surroimded by a jacket,
steam was let into the intervening space imtil a temperature of nearly 212° F.
(100° C.) was obtained ; the steam was then shut off and an open pipe immersed
in the solution. Steam from the same source was thrown directly into the liquor
in a few seconds the thermometer slowly but steadily moved, and minute after
minute progressed until it touched 250° F. (121°-1 C). This thoroughly ex-
plained the results obtained in the digesting vessel, and became to the author of

immense practical value. He discarded the use of fire applied to his vessels,

which had not only been tedious and troublesome in operation, but involved a
loss of many hundreds of pounds per annum in destruction of apparatus, and used
only steam as a vehicle of heat. As a corroboration of the theory which seems to

explain the apparent paradox, the author finds that the temperatures of his solu-
tions are in the exact ratios of their specific gravities, and have no connexion
with the temperature of the steam, which never exceeds 212° F. (100°C.): the
greater the specific gravity of an acid solution the higher the boiling-point, and
therefore, whatever the boiling-point of the solution in water of any sfilt, to that
point, or nearly, will steam of 212° F. (100° C.) raise it.

           A Chemical Method of treating the Excreta of Towns.

                            By Edw. C. C. StaJifoed, F.C.S.

    In this paper the author advances arguments to'^show that the present water-
closet system cannot be a permanent one, and submits a rational method by which,
using charcoal instead of earth, the drv' sj-stem can be universally employed in
cities. The specified objections to the use of water are :

   1. The enormous cost of the works required in proportion to the small amount

of noxious material to be removed.
   2. The large annual outlay required to keep the closets in order, and their unfit-

ness for the dwellings of the poor.

   3. The immense quantity of water required (365 times the weight of the excreta)
where, as in many towns, there is much difficulty in obtaining it.

   4. It results in a subterraneau flood of filthy water, which must flow somewhere,
and wherever it flows it pollutes the region, thus disseminating and distributing

the evil.

   5. The material removed has its value of 30.<. per ton reduced by dilution to
\d. per ton, which it is impossible by any known chemical method to extract with

profit.

   G. The sewers generate an abundance of noxious gases, which difTuse malaria
into our streets and dwellings.

    Instances are given of large outbreaks of gastric and other fevers entirely trace-
able to this source ; and authorities are quoted to show the extreme danger of these
poisonous emanations. Dr. Fergus, of Glasgow, first pointed out a fruitful cause of

escape of these gases into dwelling-houses. He frequently noticed a peculiarly

offensive sickly odour in attending patients suffering from gastric fever, and in all

casts traced it to the lead siphon and soil-pipes of the water-closet. On examina-
tion, these were always found to be perforated with small holes, through which

the gases freely escaped into the house. In some cases the whole interior of the
pipe is eaten away, and lined with a light-brown powder, the nature of which was
investigated by the author of this paper. From the several sr alyses given, it con-
tains 8(3 to 92 per cent, carbonate of lead and 2 to 3 per cent, carbonate of lime.
The carbonic acid, aided by the other gases of decomposition, act on the lead, pro-

on the large scale, the carbonate of lime being derived from the solid excreta. The
evil exists in many houses where it is long unsuspected, and it shows that lead

pipes are quite unsuitable for conveying liouse excreta.

  --Dry System. None of these disadvantages can be urged against the dry closet,

still less can any serious evil attend its use, for it meets every sanitary requirement.

Its machinery- is simple and eilective, cheap in first cost and in use. It effects at

once a great saving of water, and it enables us to secure the whole value of the

excreta.

"When dry earth is used, the onl}' objections to its adoption in large cities are,
1. The difficulty of obtaining the supply of diy earth, three and a half times the

quantity of the excreta being required.

   2. The cost of removal, involving the carriage of -3i times the weight of the
excreta into the city, and 41 times its weight out.

   Both these difficulties are at once removed by the use of charcoal, of which only

one-fourth the quantity, as compared with earth, is required; and given a stock to
commence with, by reburning the product the supply of charcoal is obtained from

the excreta itself. It is not necessary to reburn it after each use ; for dry closets it

may be dried and used again five times before being reburned, and for urinals alone
it may be used ten times. The reburning is conducted in apparatus which admits

of collecting the ammonia, acetic acid, and tar, which distil over, in the usual

condensers.

   The whole of the ammonia is thus collected, whilst the phosphoric acid, potash,

and mineral matters accumidate in the charcoal, together with the carbon, from tlie
organic constituents of the excreta. The weight of the charcoal is increased to the

extent of about 5 per cent, with each use ; and if dried and re-used five times, about
25 per cent, with each reburning.

   With this constant addition the charcoal does not require replacing with fresh

materia], the ultimate result being that the excreta are absorbed and deodorized by

a charcoal derived from itself. Thus a city working this process would, in addi-
tion to securing the whole of the ammonia and other products of destructive dis-

tillation, become sellers of a charcoal second only in value to that from bones, the

Aproduct in fact of disintegrated bone and muscle.                                                            city of 500,000 inhabitants,
--for instance, would produce 19 tons a day, or (3935 tons a year tlie total quantity

of excreta to be removed being calculated at 385 tons a day, and its value at

=29s. Qd. a ton £568. The ultimate result being the same, any charcoal may be

used at first, but that from seaweed is preferred as the best and the cheapest.
   Attention is drawn to the fact that in such a population as that referred to the

fat passed in the solid excreta would amount to 7 tons a day ; and this would
appear among the fatty oils of the tar, and form another of the products recovered.

   Starting with seaweed charcoal, a lengthened series of experiments with urine
were imdertaken, the results of which were tabulated. The same charcoal was used
100 times, and reburnt 10 times, dm-ing which it had increased 183 per cent., and
given oft' ammonia equal to 316 per cent, of sulphate. The tables show the

increase of potash, phosphoric acid, &c. for each reburning, the phosphoric acid

appearing as phosphate of lime. The charcoal, containing at first 20 per cent, car-
bonate of lime and 5 per cent, phosphate, gradually decreases the carbonate to
2 per cent., and increases the phosphate to 25 per cent., at which it remains sta-
tionary, forming a sugar-refiner's charcoal. The phosphate of lime thus gradually

deposited is equal to soluble phosphate for manurial purposes, from its finely

divided condition.

The results of a series of experiments -wath a dry closet were also tabulated. The

quantity of charcoal used was only 48 oz., to which 18 oz. were added after, the total

amount employed being 66 oz. ; the amount at the end of the experiment was

123 oz.,  57 oz.  having been derived from  the excreta                                                       this small stock  had  served

181 uses, and_ absorbed 808 oz. of mixed excreta, having been dried and returned to

source of ammonia, the average yield of sulphate being 7 per cent, of the wet ex-

creta, and 31 per cent, of the dry. The vaeld of acetate of lime was 4 per cent., and

Aof tar 9 per cent, of the dry excreta.     portion of the ammonia is combined with

acetic acid. The chars become uniform at about 24 per cent, phosphate of lime,

and 12 per cent, carbonate. This process, then, presents the following advan-
tages :

    1. Total freedom from all odour, even in an invalid's bedroom.
   2. Certain prevention of infectious diseases arising from sewer-leakage into
wells, or sewer-gases into houses.
   3 Enormous saving in water, and in cost of closets.
    4. It confines the nuisance instead of distributing it. 1 cwt. of charcoal per

month is sufficient for each closet when used by six persons daily, and the whole
may be allowed to fall at ouce from the closet through a 12-inch pipe to a cesspit
below the house, and emptied once a year. The quantity is not more than the

house ashes.

   5. By this process alone can the whole of the valuable material be recovered for

the use of the laud. Instead of forcing on the farmer a large quantity of sewage

when he does not want it, it enables us to store up the manure in a convenient

form until he requires it, and can pay its full value.

There is a popular idea that " light puts out the fire," and accurate experiments

on this point seem to be wanting ; but it is difficult to get rid of disturbing causes,

as every one engaged in photoraetrical observations is aware. In comparing

candles of the same make, the light is affected botli in quantity and economy by a

number of small circumstances, such as the warmth of the room, the existence of

slight currents of air, the extent to which the wick curls over when burning, and

so on. In testing the quality of gas, the standard candle defined by Act of Par-

liament is a sperm candle of six to the pound burning at the rate of 120 grains per

hour. From such a standard we get the terms " 12-caudle gas," " 14-caudle gas,"

&c. Mr. Sugg, in his ' Gas Manipulation,' has pointed out some of the difficulties

in obtaining a uniform standard candle. The wick does not always contain the

same number of strands ; they are not all twisted to the same degree of hard-

ness                       the so-called sperm  may vaiy in  composition, one candle containing a little
                        ;

more wax than another, or va-iable quantities of stearine, or of paraffine; the

candle maj' have been kept in store a long or a short time ; the temperature of the

store-room may liave varied considerablj', and the temperature of the room in

which it was burnt may have beeu high or low. All these circumstances affect

the rate of combustion and the illumiuating-power of caudles irrespective of the

action of light, if such action really exist.

The author had a good opportunity of testing this action at the works of Price's

Patent Candle Company at Battersea. Under the direction of Mr. Hatcher, the

chemist of the Company, care is taken to ensure identity of composition and illu-

miuating-power in candles of the same name. There has lately been an extensive

series of experiments on the photometrical value of sperm caudles, during which,

at the request of the author, Mr. Hatcher noted the rate of combustion of such

candles in a darkened room, and also in broad daylight and even in sunshine.

In the first observation, three hard and three soft candles were burned each for

Afour hours in a dark closet.                   similar set of candles taken from one and the same

filling were burned during the same time in open daylight, partly in sunlight. The

average consumption per hour of each candle was as follows :

                           Sperm in the dark                 134 grains.

circumstances would operate in producing a larger consumption of candle.

   In a second trial with No. 2 composites the results were

Tn the dark                                      140 grains each candle.

In a third, also with No. 2 composites, the results were

In the light                                     129 ,,

   In these two trials the flames were protected as far as possible from currents of
air, and in the third trial the temperatiu-e both in the light and in the dark was

nearly equal.

   The fourth trial was made on a bright sunshiny day with hard sperm candles,
which are less affected by variations of temperature than the composites. The

results were

In the dark (temp. 81°)                                  544 grains,

or 136 grains per hour.                                   567 gi-ains,
                       In the light (temp. 84°)

or 142 grains per horn* nearly.
   It is evident that in this case the increase of temperature caused by the bright

sunshine led to an increased consumption of material.
   It will be seen that in the first and fourth trials there is a greater consumption

of material in the light than in the dark, and in the second and third trials the
consumption is greater in the dark than in the light ; but in any case the difference

is so small, amounting only to from 2 to 7 grains per hour, that it may fairly be

referred to accidental circumstances, such as differences in temperature, iu currents

of air, and in the composition and make of the candles, the final conclusion being
that the direct light of the sun or the diffused light of day has no action on the

rate of burning, or in retarding the combustion of an ordinary candle.

On the Manufacture of Chlorine by means ofperpetually regenerated Manganite

                          of Calcium. By Walter Weldox.

   Since the last Meeting of the British Association chlorine has begun to be manu-
factured extensively by a process which depends on the production and perpetual
regeneration of a compound no mention of which as yet exists in chemical litera-
ture. This process, besides thus producing and continually reproducing what Ihe
author believes to be a new compound, reduces by fully 80 per cent, the principal item

in the cost of the manufacture of chlorine, greatly increases the quantity of chlo-
rine which can be practically obtained from a given quantity of hydrochloric acid,

and, moreover, enables the manufacture of chlorine to be earned on without the
production of any offensive residue.

   What has hitherto been the ordinary process of manufacturing chlorine consists

simply in digesting with hj-drochloric acid ores containing peroxide of manganese.
The reaction which takes place, besides liberating chlorine, produces chloride of
manganese, which remains behind in solution after the chlorine has gone off', and
has hitherto been usually thrown away. There have been proposed and tried a
great number of processes for transforming this chloride into peroxide for use over
again, but the only one of them which has met with the slightest measure of prac-
tical success, prior to that which is the subject of this paper, is the one which is
known, from the name of its inventor, as Dunlop's process. Dunlop's process de-
composes the chloride of manganese by heating its solution, under a pressure of
from two to four atmospheres, with milk of carbonate of lime, and then, in the dry
way, transforms the resulting carbonate of manganese into a mixture or compound
of two equivalents of peroxide with one equivalent of protoxide, by subjecting it
for 48 hours to the action of air at a temperature of about 600° Fahr. The
product of Dunlop's process is a sufficiently satisfactory one, containing about 72

per cent, of MnOj ; but the process requires a very formidable amount of appa-

ratus, and in this and other ways is so costly that its use has never extended

beyond a sing-le firm of manufacturers.

Three years ago the author began to endeavour to work out the idea of decom-

posing by either lime or magnesia the chloride of manganese in the residual

liquors of the chlorine manufacture, and then blowing air through the resulting

mixture of hydrated protoxide of manganese with solution of chloride of calcium

or of chloride of magnesium, as the case might be. He took for granted that one-

half of the protoxide of manganese so treated was the largest proportion of it that

--could thereby be converted into MnOj in other words, that one could obtain only

sesquioxide lay this method ; but it was soon found that, when using lime to de-

compose the chloride of manganese, considerably more than half the protoxide

operated upon was frequently' converted into MnO,. It was found eventually that
more than half the protoxide was thus peroxidized only when more lime was used

than simply the quantity necessary to decompose the chloride of manganese, and

when what was treated with air was thus a mixture of protoxide of manganese and

lime; and it was also found that in all such cases there was a definite relation

between the quantity of lime associated with the protoxide of manganese and the

quantity of the protoxide, in excess of half, which became peroxidized. This led

to the discovery that whereas when protoxide of manganese by itself is treated
with air in the wet way one-half is the maximum proportion of it which can

thereby be converted into MnO^,, the association of a certain proportion of lime

with the protoxide so treated will enable the whole of it to become converted into

MnOj. It is to this fact, together with that of the much greater rapidity with

which protoxide of manganese can be peroxidized by treatment with air in the «-et
way when lime is present than when lime is not present, that the practical success

of the new method of manufacturing chlorine is mainly due.

The action of lime in increasing the proportion of protoxide of manganese which

can be peroxidized by treatment with air in the wet way, evidently consists in the

lime substituting itself for that part of the protoxide which, when protoxide ©f

manaranese not having any other basic substance associated with it is treated with

air in the wet way, does not undergo peroxidation. It would seem that the pro-

duction of MnOj in the wet way, by direct combination between hydrated MnO

and atmospheiic oxygen, absolutely requires the presence of a base with which the

MnO^ can combine as it forms. "When protoxide of manganese, not having any

other basic substance associated with it, is treated with air in the wet way, a part

of the protoxide itself  has to  act  as the required base                                                                                           and this is the reason why,
                                                                                                                                                  ;

in that case, not more than half of the protoxide can become peroxidized, the other

half being required to combine, as MnO, with the half which becomes converted

into MnOj. When, however, the protoxide of manganese which is treated with
air in the wet way has lime associated with it, the MnO, which forms (or a part of

it, according to the proportion of lime present) combines witli CaO instead of with

MnO, thus leaving free to undergo peroxidation that part of the MnO which, but

for the presence of the CaO, this MnOo must have combined with, and which

would thus have got locked up in a state in which it would have been incapable of
being peroxidized, at least in the wet way and by air alone. Hence the presence

of enough lime to take the place of that half of the protoxide which, if no lime

were present, would have to go into combination as base, and also to supply enough

base for that half itself to combine with after undergoing peroxidation, will enable

the whole of the MnO operated upon to be raised to the state of MnO,. The

minimum quantity of lime which is enough for this purpose is an equivalent for

each equivalent of MnO operated upon, or the quantity necessary to supply an

equivalent of lime to all the JNInO, which can be produced by the peroxidation of

all the MnO.

By treating with air, then, a mixture of protoxide of manganese and lime suspended

either in water or in solution of chloride of calcium, there is formed a compound

containing MnO, and OaO in the proportion of an equivalent of one to an equivalent

of the other. This compound may be regarded as sesquioxide of manganese, or

Mn^03, the MnO in which is replaced by CaO. The author calls it manganite of

calcium, and believes it to be a new compound. Gorgeu, in 1862, described a com-

pound which he called manganite of calcium ; but his compound contained five
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                81

equivalents of MnO, per equivalent of CaO, and the CaO in it was so feebly com-
bined that it readily decomposed chloride of manganese. The author's compound

contains only one equivalent of MnOj per equivalent of CaO, and has no action

upon salts of manganese.

This compound has now been produced and reproduced to the extent of some

hundreds of tons. The process of producing it and applying it to the manufacture

--of chlorine is conducted as follows : The residual liquor which remains after a

charge of manganite has reacted upon hydrochloric acid in any suitable still is run

from the stiU into a well or other receptacle in which it is treated with carbonate

of lime, to neutralize any free acid, and to decompose any sesquichloride of iron or

sesquichloride of aluminium which may be contained in it. The neutralized

liquor is then pumped up into an elevated cistern, in which it is left at rest for a
few hours in order that it may deposit certain solid matters which it now holds in

suspension. The most abundant of these is usually sulphate of calcium, due to the

somewhat considerable quantity of sulphuric acid which is nearly always con-

tained in the hydrochloric acid produced in alkali works ; but there are also small

quantities of sesquioxide of iron, derived from the sesquichloride of iron in the

hydrochloric acid, and sometimes partly from the lime used in the process, and

larger or smaller quantities of alumina and silica, due to the lime. These im-

purities having deposited, the supernatant liquor, which is a mixed solution of

chloride of manganese and chloride of calcium, and is now quite clear and of a

beautifid rose coloiu', is run off into another vessel, where there is added to it the

quantity of lime necessarj^ to decompose the chloride of manganese in it and nearly

Aan equivalent more.  blast of air is then injected into the resulting mixture, and

what was at first a perfectly white mud, all the manganese in which was in the
state of MnO, soon becomes a very black mud, nearly all the manganese in which

is in the state of IMnO,. This is "then allowed to settle for about twelve hours, at

the end of which time it has separated into a denser black mud and a supernatant

clear solution of chloride of calcium. This solution of chloride of calcium having
been di-awn off, what remains is ready for use in the still. It is used as mud,
without drying, being conveyed to the still by pipes and entering by a hydraulic

lute. In the still it meets with hydrochloric acid, from which it liberates chlorine,
at the same time reproducing exactly such a residual solution as was commenced
with. With this solution the round of operation is recommenced ; and so on, over
and over again, continually. The samples exhibited were portions of a charge of
manganese which, at the works of Messrs. J. C. Gamble and Sons, of St. Helen's,
has actually generated chlorine, from which bleaching-powder has been made,

about fifty successive times.

   Hitherto the principal item in the cost of chlorine has been that for native
peroxide of manganese. Last year, in Great Britain, France, Belgium, and Ger-

many together, there were produced about 120,000 tons of bleaching-powder,

which cost, on an average, for native oxide of manganese, not much, if any, less
than £5 per ton. The author's process substitutes for this cost for native oxide of
manganese a cost for the regeneration of manganite of calciimi not exceeding 15s.
per ton of bleaching-powder, being about 10s. for lime, l.s. for steam. Is. for wages,

and 2s. for interest and wear and tear. Moreover, whereas hitherto, at least in this

country and in all but an extremely few exceptional cases, the production of a ton
of bleaching-powder has required the acid from about 75 cwt. of salt, this com-
pound yields chlorine enough for a ton of bleaching-powder from the acid from

less than 45 cwt. of salt. This larger yield of chlorine is mainly due to the arti-

ficial manganite being so easily soluble that it can very readily be caused to neu-

tralize from 95 to 99 per cent, "of the acid employed, which is a very much larger

Aproportion of it than can be neutralized when working with manganese ores.

third very important advantage of the new process over the old one consists in this,

that whereas the immense quantities of acid which escape neutralization in the old

process are usually (and have almost necessarily to be) sent into the rivers, as

free acid, the only product of the new process which has to be thrown away is a

perfectly neutral solution of chloride of calcium.

              On the Action of Phosphoric Chloride on Hydric Sulphate.
                                   By Stephen "Williams.

      Dr. Williamson first described this important reaction as the replacement of one
  molecule of liydroxyl in hydric sulphate by monovalent chlorine, with the forma-

 tion of chlorophosphoric acid and a body having the formula HCl SO3, which he

  termed chlorhydrated sulphm-ic acid. The further investigation of this reaction
  quite confirms Dr. Williamson's observations, but at the same time shows that the
  operation goes further than was at first supposed ; the chlorophosphoric acid react-
 ing on the hydric sulphate in the same manner as the phosphoric chloride. The

 whole operation may be represented in three steps :
                    (1) H.SO^ + PCl, =:P0Cl3+HCl-}-HClS03.
                        (2) H.,S0,+P0Cl,=P0,Cl-t-IICH-HClS03.
                      (3) H; S0,+P0, C1= HCl S03H-HP03.

    It was also ascertained that the chlorhydrated sulphuric acid, when added to
 hydric sulphate, breaks up into hydric chloride and sulphm-ie acid (SO,), which

  explains the apparent contradiction in Gerhardt's statement, viz. that one of the
 products of the reaction of phosphoric chloride on hydric sulphate was sulphmie

  acid.

          Address by Professor Haekness, F.B.S., President of the Section.

 It has of late become the custom to open the several Sections of the British Asso-
 ciation with an introductory Address.

    This custom I believe had its origin in this Section when the Association
 met at Aberdeen ; and upon that occasion Sir Charles Lyell made the important
 discovery of M. Boucher de Perthes of the occurrence of flint weapons with the
bones of large extinct mammals in the gravels of the Valley of the Somme tho

 subject of his opening address.

   In some instances new matter of importance in connexion with geology has

furnished materials for this opening address, but more frequently subjects of local
interest have supplied the matter for this pm-pose ; and it is in connexion with the
latter that I shall occupy for a short time your attention.

   In no portion of Great Britain have we a better development of the series of
roi^ks which forms the link between the well-established Devonian formation and
the succeeding well-recognized Carboniferous group than in this county. The rocks
which form the link I have referred to are known to geologists as the Pilton beds,
deriving their name from the locality in Devonshire where they are best developed.
These rocks have been made the subjects of investigation by Sir Roderick I. Mur-
chison. Prof. Sedgwick, Sir H. T. De la Beche, Mr. Weaver, Mr. Godwin-Austen,
Prof. Phillips, and others ; and of late they have been carefully examined by Mr.
Jukes, Mr. Salter, INIr. Townshend Hall, and Mr. Etheridge.

  My reason for refen'iug to these rocks is to point out their relations to certain

strata which are very well exhibited in the south-west of Ireland, and which occur

in a horizon corresponding to the Pilton shales.

   The Irish representatives of the Pilton shales are marked by a mineral aspect,
very nearly allied to their equivalents in this country ; and they contain organic

remains of a type very closely approximating to such as are found in the Pilton rocks.
   Before alluding to the Pilton beds, I will refer to their Irish representatives, and

the rocks upon which these repose.
   In doing so I shall avail myself of the labours of the late Mr. Jukes, and the

oflicers of the Irish branch of the Geological Survey, who were for several years

engaged upon these rocks. Before doing so I must, however, pay a passing tribute

to the memory of one who has so recently been removed from the scene of his

labours.

   For more than eighteen years the late Mr. Jukes filled the office of Director of

the Geological Survey of Ireland ; and the numerous maps and memoirs which
have emanated from this Survey while imder his conti'ol speak alike of the labour
and accuracy with which this work has been done. Every geologist personally
acquainted with the late Air. Jukes must know how ready he was on every occasion

to impart all the knowledge he possessed to those who sought it, and that earnest
love of his subject and kindness of heart which so distinguished him caused him
to be beloved by all who had the pleasm-e of his acquaintance. On many occasions

this Section of the British Association has had valuable communications from him,

and many who are now present wiU well remember the apt and vigorous manner of
Mr. Jukes when he had anything to address to this Section.

   The portion of Ireland nearest Devonshire where we have rocks which can be
compared with those of this coimtry is the neighboui'hood of the town of Wex-
ford. Here are strata reposing ivpon Cambrian rocks which have been assigned to
the Old Red Sandstone by the officers of the Irish Survey, attaining a thickness of
about 200 feet. At the western extremity of the County of Wexford, at Hook
Point, the Old Red Sandstones are from 600 to 700 feet thick. In the Comeragh

Mountains, to the north-west, they have a thickness of not less than 1700 feet
and south-west, from the Comeraghs near Dimgarven, they are upwards of 3000

feet in thickness. In the west of the County Cork we have from 5000 to 6000
feet of Old Red Sandstones exposed ; and here the upper portion is denuded, and

the base is not seen. In the Gleugariff and Killarney country from 8000 to 10,000
feet of these strata are exhibited, and here also the base is not visible.

   On the south side of the Dingle promontory the Old Red Sandstones occur
imder different circumstances. They are here from 3000 to 4000 feet thick, and

are seen resting unconformahly on rocks which are of a reddish-pui-ple colour, and
at least 10,000 feet thick. These reddish-purple beds repose conformablj' on the
representatives of the Ludlow series.

   The strata of the south of Ireland which represent the Old Red Sandstones, and
which in the neighbourhood of Glengariff and Killarney attain a greater thickness

than 10,000 feet, are extremely barren in organic remains. Several thousand feet

upper portion of the series, which is comparati\"ely thin, and which consists of
"yellow sandstones," that organic remains occur. These consist of remains of
plants, which at Kiltorkan, in County Kilkenny, are in a beautifrd state of preserva-

tion. Fish-remains are also foimd, referable to the genera Coccosteus and Gyrolepis,

likewise a very characteristic shell, Anodon Jukcsii, and crustacean remains iu the

form of a species of Eiiri/pterm.

   In Ireland, the strata which succeed conformably the Yellow Sandstones have
been called hj Sir R. Griffith the Lower Limestone Shales. In the south of
Ireland these strata have a gi-eat thickness ; and where they possess a slaty cleav-
age, the term Carboniferous slate has also been applied to them. These strata,

in the eastern portion of the County Wexford, where the Old Red Sandstones are
thin, have no distinct existence. In the western part of the same coimtj', at Hook
Point, where the Old Red Sandstone deposits are thicker than in the eastern por-
tions of Wexford, the Lower Limestone Shales make their appearance as a distinct

group, separating the Carboniferous Limestones above from the Yellow Sandstones
below; and here their thickness is between 10 and 20 feet.

  We have already seen how the Old Red Sandstones have increased in thickness

in the neighbourhood of Dungarven. The Carboniferous slates also attain a nuich
greater development here than at Hook Point, for the officers of the Geological
Survey give their thickness at 700 feet ; and near Youghal, still further westward,
they have a thickness of about 900 feet.

   On the west side of Cork harbour we have examples of a still greater develop-
ment of the Carboniferous slates, for here they are at least 1500 feet thick. At the
Old Head of Kinsale 6500 feet represent their thickness, and further westward they

attain to even a greater development.

   In the County of Cork gritty bands make their appearance iu the Carljouiferous

tliiu and vevy irregular. They become very thick in the vrestern portion of this

county, and in Coonihola Glen they have their greatest development, being at leas
3000 feet in thickness. These giitty beds have been termed " Coomhola Grits."

They contain some peculiar fossils, and they have others in common with the Car-

boniferous slates. 1 hey are interstratiiied with sljvte bands; and although most

extensively developed near the base of the Carboniferous slates, they are merely

local members of this series, emanating from conditions somewhat different from

those from whence the great mass of the Carboniferous slates have originated.

   Having described generally the arrangement of the rocks of the south of Ireland

which represent the Pilton beds, and also the deposits which support them, we

have now to refer to North Devon. On the north side of Baggy Point and east-
ward thereof, there are hard purple sandstones, possessing many of the features of

the Old Red Sandstones of the south of Ii-eland, which immediately underlie the

" Yellow Sandstones," and upon these in North Devon are light-coloured beds,

which represent the Irish Yellow Sandstones.

In the neighbourhood of Marwood, reposing on the equivalents of the Yellow

Sandstone, are greenish-gi'ey grits, afibrding a group of fossils intimately allied to

those contained in the Coomhola gTits ; and among these are plant-remains identical

with such as occur near the base of the Carboniferous slates. These have been

obtained by the Rev. M. Mules. The mineral nature and the fossil remains place

the jMarwood sandstones and the Coomhola grits on the same horizon.

The fossil plants which occur near the base of the Carboniferous slate, and in

the Marwood sandstones, are specifically identical with such as are found at the

base of the Carboniferous formation in the north of England. Here Filicites linearis

and Sar/enaria Velthcimiana occur, and these are the forms which the base of the

Carboniferous slates aflbrd.

The Pilton rocks succeed the Marwood sandstones, and these Pilton rocks in

their mineral nature are intimately allied to the Carboniferous slates. The strata

which make up the Pilton group consist of shales and slates, generally of a dark

colour, with associated sandstones and gritty beds, and occasional thin bands of

limestone full of corals. The fossils of the Pilton rocks are very closely connected

with those of the Carboniferous slates. Some forms, however, which occiu- in the

Pilton rocks have not yet been recognized in their Irish representatives.

There are species of I'hacops, Strop/icilosiaj)ro(h(cioi(les,a,nda,{ew other species.

But such fossils as are most abundant in the Pilton rocks are those most common

in the Carboniferous slates.

There is an idea prevalent among many English geologists that the Coomhola

grits are a series of rocks distinct from, and lying beneath the Carboniferous strata,

and this idea has, I believe, given rise to erroneous impressions concerning this

series. I have pointed out that this is not the conclusion of the officers of the

Irish Geological Sm'vey, and my own observations ha^e led me to results similar

to theirs. I hope this Meeting will afford more information concerning the Mar-
wood beds and the Pilton rocks, and that we shall have farther evidence which

will enable geologists to say whether these strata shall be referred to the Devonian

Agroup or to the Carboniferous formation.   baud of pale slates, with a few bivalves,

lies between the purple sandstones of Mort Bay and the gTeenish-grey grits of the
Marwood series. It is desiralile that farther information should be afforded con-

cerning these strata and their fossil contents.

  It appears to me that the boimdary between the Devonian or Old Red Sand-

stone and the Carboniferous formation is in the British Isles placed in different

horizons. In L'eland tlie Carboniferous slates and interbedded Coomhola grits are

referred to the latter, while in this country the equivalents of these ai'e looked upon

as appertaining to the Devonian formation.

Besides tlie ^larwood sandstones and the Pilton rocks, there are other matters of

greater interest in connexion vrith the geology of Devonshire.

   TheTriassic strata of this coimtry, in the neighbourhood of Budleigh-Salterton,
has within it some peculiar pebble-beds, which have been described by Messrs.
Salter and Vicary. These pebble-beds aboimd in fragments containing fossils

similar to those which the Silurians of Normandy aUbrd. Recently these Triassic

strata have yielded toMr.Wliitaker important pala^ontological evidence, in the form
TKANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  85

of reptilian remains, -wliicli Prof. Huxley has referred to the g-enus Hyperodapedon.
This evidence goes a long way towards supporting the conclusion that the Lossie-
mouth sandstones near Elgin are of a much newer age than their stratigTaphical
arrangements would seem to indicate, and that they belong to the Trias rather
than to the Old Red Sandstones, to which they have previously been referred by
many geologists.

   In Devonshire also we have a better development of Miocene strata than is to

be found elsewhere in the British Isles ; and the locality where these strata occur

is within a short distance of Exeter : I refer to Bovey Tracey and its lignite beds.
These latter have been made the subject of a valuable communication to the Royal
Society by Mr. Pengelly. The plant-remains which have been obtained therefrom

have been described by the eminent Swiss botanist, Dr. Oswald Heer ; and, thanks

to the generosity of that noble-hearted lady Miss Burdett C'outts, who is alike de-

sirous to promote science and to alleviate himian suffering, the fossils obtained from

these Bovey Tracey lignites are now well known to geologists. The plant-remains
which these strata contain are the relics of a vegetation which, during the Lower

Miocene epoch, spread over a large portion of the Continent of Europe, and ex-

tended into the arctic regions of America ; a vegetation which clothed not only
Em-ope with lofty forest trees, and a rich undergrowth of smaller plants, but which

also covered Greenland and Spitzbergen, lauds which are now the abode of ice and

snow, with an equally rich vegetation.

   This extensive ditiusion of similar forms of plants during the older Miocene
period, speak to us of widely extended uniform climate, contrasting strongly with

the climates which now prevail in the temperate and arctic zones of the Northern

Hemisphere.

  --There is another matter connected with the geology of Devonshire which has

special interest the caves of this county and their contents. These have been

made the subjects of many valuable communications to this Section by Mr.
Pengelly, and the gentlemen who are associated with him on the Committee for

the Exploration of Kent's Hole.

   Met, as we now are, in a locality so near the source from whence so much of in-

terest has come, I believe that this Section will again have before it important
matter referring to Kent's Hole and other Devonshire caverns ; and I cannot doubt

that many Members of the British Association -will avail themselves of the oppor-
tunity of examining the spot from whence so much valuable information has been
derived, bearing upon the early history of the human race.

   Geology and archseology are now blending into each other ; and although the
early history of nian remained for a long time, like distant land, dim and ill-
defined, of late, owing to the labours of Sir Charles Lyell, Sir John Lubbock and
others, we are now acquiring a clearer conception of our early ancestors, of their
mode of life, and of the conditions under which they existed.

0)1 the Elevation and Depression of the Greenland Coast. By Robert Bkown,

           F.B.G.S., Geolorjist to the West Greenlatul Expedition (1867).

   The author in this paper attempted to reconcile the conflicting statements ot
difi'erent writers regardmg the elevation and depression of the Greenland coast.
The American explorers in Smith's Soimd declare that the coast is rising, while
it is a notorious fact, observed by the author and others, that in the Danish pos-
sessions, south of 7.3° N. lat., the contrary holds true. Both statements were par-
tially correct, but not in an exclusive se'nse. I. That there is a depression going

on is proved by (a) the walls of old houses being submerged, O) houses choked
in by ice, where no native would now build them, (y) poles on which the Eskimo

Kayaks are suspended being submerged; and amongst numerous other similar
instances quoted, (8) it was mentioned that the blubber-house of Claushavn, in
lat. 69'' 7' N., originally built on a little island off the shore, had in 1866 to be
removed, the lower floor being invariably submerged at high tide. From various
data supplied, the author did not consider that the rate of depression was more
than five feet in a century.

   II. This depression had been noted as far as the Danish trading-posts extended
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;:

 and there was little likeliliood that it ended there ; only it had not heen ohserved
fiu'ther, no civilized men having passed a sufficiently long time in Smith's Somid,
or elsewhere north of Danish Greenland, to ohtain accm-ate data. Hence Drs.
Kane and Hayes, observing certain terraces near their winter-quarters, concluded
that the coast was there rising, and for want of further information, their opinions
have been tolerably extensively adopted, even though they were in direct contra-
diction of the long-continued and well-established obsei-vation made to the south-
ward of their point of observation.

   The author explained these ten-aces by supposing that there had been a rise,
though there is now a fall going on. These terraces, or their counterparts, are seen
all along the C4reenland coast, and were fuUy described from his observations made
in 1861 and 1867. The interval between Hayes's and Kane's winter-quarters has

been so little examined, either by the geographer or the geologist, that little could
be said about it, but south wai'd of 73^ N. lat., this raised portion of the sea-bottom
is seen at intervals. The hills (as described in the author's ' Florula Discoana'*) are
in general low and rounded, and everywhere scattered with perched blocks and

boulders, many of them brought from more southern and northern latitudes.
These angular blocks are very different from the rounded and worn boulders which
have been subjected to the gToovong action of superincumbent ice. They bear the
impress of having been dropped on the former sea-bottom by icebergs, which had
borne them downward fi-om the moraines of old glaciers. In other localities, in.
the hollows or along the sea-shore, we see several feet of the glacial clays (the
counterpart, in fact, of the "brick-clays " of some parts of Great Britain) full of
Arctic sheUs, Crustacea, Echinodermata, &c., such as are now living in the neigh-

bouring sea, while in other places the clay is bare of organic remains. In this
glacial clay of Greenland (which the author considered the counterpai't of the
upper laminated boulder-claj's of Great Britain and the North of Europe) all the
shells 8ic. are recent species, living in the Greenland sea to this A&y, with two
exceptions. These are Glycimeris siliqun and Tanopaa Norvegica'\ ; but as both of

these are found in the Newfoundland sea, we inay expect them yet to be shown to

be living in Davis Strait. This " fossiliferous clay " has been found up to the
height of more than 500 feet above the sea, on the banks overhanging glaciers,
where frequently the old shells are deposited on the glacier among the moraine,
and carried out by icebergs, by which they are again deposited on the sea-bottom,
thus completing a second revolution of change. In some portions of this olay, in
knots, the author found impressions of the Angmaksak of the Eskimo, the Capelin
of Newfoundland {3IaUotm arcfiais, 0. Fab.), which was doubtless the tish refen-ed
to by Professor Louis Agassiz, when he speaks of knowing only one fossil fish as
perfectly identical with living species, " a Mallotus, which is found in nodules
of clay of unknotcn age in Greenland." iVmong other instances given as evidences
of a former elevation was cited the fact of two huts, or their remains, being found
on an island high above the sea, in places where no Greenlander woidd ever fix his

habitation. He also heard of a lake in which there was said (on excellent autho-

rity) to be marine shells naturalized. The author of this paper therefore concluded
that there (1) had been a foi-mer rise of the land, and (2) that at the present
time the coast is gi-adually sinking. Thus we see in Greenland two appearances
1st, in the interior mer civ f/Iace, what Scotland once ^vas during the glacial epoch
2nd, on the coast what Scotland now is, as far as her glacial clays and other

remains are concerned.

                             On a Fossil Mussel-sliell found in Drift in Irelmid.

                                      By Eugene A. Conavell, M.B.I.A.

The author exhibited a marine mussel-shell measui-ing 3^ inches in length, \\ inch

at its broadest part, and ^ inch in internal depth, still in as perfect a state of preserva-

tion as when worn by its ancient occupant. An oblong-shaped pearly excrescence,

about the eighth of an inch in length, is attached to the centre of the interior part

of the shell, and some of the fine sand in which this bivalvular fossil has lain

deposited for ages stiU adheres to the inside of it. It was pronounced to be a spe-

cimen of the Mtjtilus vulf/aris inhabiting our present British seas. It was dug up on

Saturday, August 22, 1868, by a labourer employed by the author to raise gi'avel

for walks, from the bottom ot an ancient sand-hill, or escar, within a quarter of a

mile of the town of Trim, in a portion of the groimds of the District Model National

Schools, established there by the Commissioners of National Education in 1849. This

fossil was found resting under the regis of a large boulder, which in some degree

may account for its very peifect state of preservation, and in a situation at present

25 miles from the nearest sea-coast, and about 200 feet above the present sea-level.

And here the consideration arises, how vast must be the period of time that has

elapsed since the sand and gi-avel in which this shell has been imbedded were

rolled about by the waters of an ocean which has retreated at least 25 miles from

this spot ; and, still more, how vastness of time must be piled on vastness since the

lowest of the stratified rocks under this old escar was deposited; and how many

times " Old Ocean " must have advanced on this land and again retreated to sub-

merge other lands

The gravel, or drift, in which it was found consists of dark Carboniferous limestone

pebbles, utterly devoid of flint nodules, thus proving the antiquity of the drift, and

rests upon a portion of that large bed of Carboniferous limestone-rock which occupies

the greater part of the middle of the island.

The hills and ridges of sand and gTavel, so conspicuous across the centi-e of Ire-

land, are supposed to have been formed in the eddies of opposing and conflicting

currents, at a period when the present dry land was the bed of an ocean. Sometimes

they are to be seen in single heaps, and at other times in narrow ridges, of all degrees

of fineness and coarseness of material, varying in height from 20 to 80 feet, and ex-

tending in some parts from 1 to 20 miles in length. The prevailing direction of the

line of subsidence of these ranges of drift in Ii'eland, rimning, as they generally do,

nearly due east and west, has always appeared to the author to be in some degree

connected with the rotation of the earth on its axis dm-ing the process of their being

accumulated on the ocean-bed.

These hiUs of gravel are popularly known (and only in Ireland) by the name of

escars, from a purely primitive Irish word (eiscif) meaning a ridge of high land, but
generally applied to a sandy ridge. The term, usually takmg the form of esker (as

it is pronounced), is the name of about fifty townlands in Ireland, and combines to

form the names of many other places, more especially across the middle than in

either the_ north or the south of Ireland. Although the nomenclatm-e of escar for

sand-hiU is peculiar to Ireland, it is curious to remark that we have now a town

situated on a sand-hill, at the base of the Pyrenees, called Escar, which is a Basque

name                         and it is understood that the Basques have had a language peculiarly then-
                          ;

own, but they have also had easy communication vsdth Ireland.

. Not far from, or indeed belonging to, the escar in which this shell was found,

there is a line of gravel hills extending, with slight interruption, from Dublin to

Galway, called Esker-Riada                                                                                                                                  and this is the  most historically celebrated escar  in
                                                                                                                                                         ;

Ireland, having been fixed upon as the boundary between the northern and the

southern half of Ireland when the country was divided, in the second century,

between Owen More and Conn of "The Hundred Battles." This ridge probably

has its name, as the late eminent Irish scholar. Professor Eugene O'Cimy, thought,
from the chariots that used to run on it.

Notes on the Braclilopoda liWierto obtained from tlie " Pehhle-hed " of Budleigh-

      Salierton, iiear Exmoutli, in Devonshire. By T. Davidsox, F.li.S.

  On the 16tli of December, 1863, Messrs. W. Vicaiy and J. W. Salter made a com-

munication to the Geological Society on the pebble-bed at Budleifrh-Salterton,
wherein some thirty-six different fossils were described, and attributed, with greater
or lesser contidence, to the Lower Silurian period. Of these, ten or twelve are
Brachiopoda. Subsequently the author of this paper, having had from Mr. Vicary
and others the opportunity of examining several hundred specimens from the same
locality, was able to deternrine bej'ond doubt that a large proportion of the shells
were of Devonian age, while others ma}' be of SUurian origin.

  A great mystery is stated to hang over the derivation of the boulders composing

that " remanier " deposit ; the melange of fossils does not seem to occur in the same
pebble, but, on the contrary, every individual boulder contains species referable to
the one or to the other epoch, so that no real mingling of Silurian and Devonian fos-
sils has been hitherto detected in the same pebble. The rock is usually a sandstone

or quartzite, and it is difficult to conceive now fossils of two distinct ages (if true)

should occur in the same kind of rock, and be accumulated in the same locality, so

that many geologists have, rightly or wi-ongly, supposed all the boidders to be of a

similar age. It has not hitherto been possible to discover from where these
pebbles h&ve been drifted, or where is the parent rock, but they are supposed to be
of French origin, although no similar rock in Normandy or in Great IBritain has
produced the assemblage of species contained in the Budleigh boulders.

   The fossils occur in the shape of internal casts and external impressions, and only
a small proportion of the boulders are fossiliferous. The author has detected some
thirty-seven species of Brachiopoda, which he described and illustrated. Of these
about ten, or perhaps less, are considered to be Silurian, twelve or more are without
doubt Devonian, while fifteen are either new or not yet identified with described
species, or have not hitherto been found associated in the same pebble or rock with
any of the others recorded as Silurian and Devonian, but most of them seem to pos-
sess more of the Devonian than Silurian facies. It is highly probable that when
the species of the other classes, also occurring in these pebbles, shall have been care-
fully and critically examined, that the true age of the above fifteen species will be

established, as the whole series must be taken into consideration before we can

arrive at any definite conclusion.

On the Occurrence of the Mineral Scheelite (Timf/state of Lime) at Val Toppa

   Gold Mine, near Domodossola, Piedmont. By C. Le Neve rosxES, B.A.,

    D.Sc., F.G.S.

   The author stated that Scheelite (tungstate of lime) is now occurring at the Val

Toppa Gold-mine. It is associated with quartz, iron pyrites, galena, zinc-blende,
calc-spar, brown spar, and native gold ; whilst wolfram, tinstone, molybdenite,
fluor-spar, apatite, topaz, and tourmaline, which usually accompany Scheelite, are
entirely absent. The Scheelite is called " Marmor rosso " by the Piedmontese
miners, and is looked upon as a good indication for gold.

   P.S. Since this paper was written, the author has received a letter fi'om Mr.
David Forbes about the occurrence of Scheelite. In his ' Researches on the Mi-
neralogy of South America,' p. 40, he speaks of Scheelite as one of the " minerals of
the Post-Silurian Granite eruptions, and their accompanying metallic veins."

                    By R. A. C. GoDmN-ArsTEN, F.B.S., F.G.S.

   The object of this paper was to define the general arrangement of land and water
over the northern hemisphere during the period of the accumulation of the "De-
vonian" group.

   After a short account of physical changes during earlier Palaeozoic times, it was
shown that the northern hemisphere had acquired and presented a great extent of
terrestrial surface immediately antecedent to the " Devonian " or Middle Palseozoic

period. Commencing the inquiry with reference to the American area, the extent
and range of the " Hamilton marine group " indicates tliat the relative position of
the coast-line, whence its materials were derived, was in the north and east
whilst the arrangement of all the subordinate members of that group point clearly

to thedirection of distribution having been south and west.

   In like manner the marine Devonian group has a well-defined northern boundary-

line across the Europeo- Asian region. Wholly wanting in Ireland, it is well exhi-

bited, in its early facies, in North Devon (Linton), next seen in the Boulonnais
and has been proved to underlie the Cretaceous formation of the north of France^
as far as beyond LiUe and Tournay, from near which latter place it presents a
well-defined limit across Belgium eastwards. At Gembloux it is seen to have
been accumulated unconformably upon a much older Palteozolc series (Lower

Silurian).

   The fiu-ther extension of the " Devonian " sea-beds is concealed for a considerable

interval by Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Nummiditic gToups, but they reappear in the
mass of the Harz Moimtains, where, as in the Belgian sections, they present un-

conformity.

  mThe gradation of change, resulting from shallow to deeper water conditions, is

well marked the Harz "Devonian" series, and hence may be inferred with cer-
tamty that the boundary-line lay to the north. Like considerations applied to the
Devonian depositions of Germany, to the south and east of the Ilartz, put that part
of Central Europe in the condition of sea, and place the boundary-line as trendino-

north-east, conforming to the mass of the old Scandinavian land, as from above
Magdebourgtothe Gulf of Eiga, and thence, by St. Petersburg, to the White Sea.
   From this, Its northern limit, the "Devonian" sea stretched southwards over

Devon and Cornwall, France, the north-east parts of Spain, and over North Africa ·

eastwards, across Europe, to the shores of the Black Sea, into Central Asia (Altai) ·
and we have its characteristic fauna from Thibet and China.                                                                         '

_ From the south-eastern extremity of this great continent there was an exten-

sion of the land south-west along the present Atlantic sea-hoard, much as
Tenasserim and Malacca stretch away at present from the East-Asian continent.
  On the European side the extent of land-surface was much less ; it included only
the Scandinavian mass, together with the greater portion of the British-Islands

group, the whole having a common strike from north-east to south-west ; but this
land had a much greater extension on the Atlantic side than at present ; and it
is very probahle, on other considerations, that at that time this old part of our
present European land-surface was one with that of th« American, the whole
tornimg a great circumpolar continent, ranging across more than 180° of longitude.
   The positions of certain insular masses, such as the central plateau of France and
others, were indicated.

    Since Prof. Sedgwick and Sir R. Miu-cliison proposed to substitute " Devonian "

 for " Old Red Sandstone " very much lias been done, by very acciu'ate observers,

 with respect to the latter local accumulations. It has been ascertained to be cer-
 tainly a duplex, if not a triplex group, each division being dependent on contem-

 poraneous physical changes, and each of which may be representative of the three

 severally distinct stages, on the systematic marine scale ; namely, of part of the
 Upper Silurian of Sir R. Murchison's system, of the true " Devonian," and, lastly,
 in some cases of the Lower Carboniferous period.

    The great geological interest which attaches to the ti-ue " Old Red Sandstone "

--consists in this that, as does the " Hm-onian " for an earlier Pala3ozoic stage, and

 as does the Piu'beck-Wealden group for the great break in the Secondary (Jurassic
 and Cretaceous) formations, it serves hj its magnitude to illustrate the vast lapse
 of time which really separates the marine groups of formations which geologists
place in immediate sequence, and serves also to show the nature of the subaerial
 operations of the time.

    Owing to the length of the communication the second part, relating to the geo-
graphical distribution of the Devonian marine faxma, was not read.

Notes on the Dlscoveri/ of some Fossil Plants in the Cambrian (^Upper Long-

                 mynd) Rocks, near St. David's, By Dr. Hicks.

    The plant-impressions occur on some thin layers of shale facing the surfaces of
rough grit-ljeds, at a place called Treller\vi-, two miles to the east of St. David's.
These beds form a part of the section whicli underlies the " Menevian " rocks of
the well-kuo\sni creek of Porth-y-Rhaw, and belong to the same series of grey
beds as those in which the fossils, mentioned in the author's paper read at the
Norwich Meeting last year, were discovered ; they are lower down than the
zone of the Trilobites (a hivalved crustacean and Lim/idcUa ferriKjinea ha^e
been discovered over 800 feet deeper in the section). These beds are strongly
ripple-marked, and give indications of having been deposited in shallow water.
The ones immediately above, and which contain the other fossils {Plutonia Sedg-
wiclci, Conoconjphe LyeUii, &c.), are of a finer grain, and indicate a somewhat deeper

water-deposit. No other fossils have ]}een discovered as yet along with the

plant-impressions, though, as already stated, others occur below, and also almost
immediately above. These beds are entirely separated from the "Menevian
gToup " by a good thickness of purple and red rocks.

   One of the specimens exhibited was obtained by the author some years ago from
the " Menevian group;" it was shown because of some amount of resemblance to
the plants just found. This, however, came from a deep-sea deposit, and is there-
fore most probably a distinct species.

              The Extinction of the Mammoth. By H. H. Howoeth.

    After a survey of all the authorities within his reach, the author concluded that
no existing theory accoimted for the following facts, which are indisputable :

   1. That the Mammoth lived in the area where his remains are foimd.
   2. That a great portion of that area is now a moss-covered tundra, or an ice and

boulder heap, as in the Bear Islands.

  3. That no herbivore of the size and plentiful development of the Mammoth

could find food in that area now.

   4. That although covered with wool, and therefore adapted to a much more
rigorous climate than that of India and Africa, neither Mammoth nor Rhinoceros

could survive the present winter temperature of Northern Siberia.

   5. The remains of the food eaten by the Mammoth and Rhinoceros, found and
exam in ed by Midderndorft' and Brandt, are remains of plants only found now in

more southern latitudes.
   The only possible conclusion from these facts is, that the climate and condition

of things in Siberia have altered very greatly since the days of the Mammoth. In

--support of this conclusion, such facts as the following are conclusive : the bed of
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  91

the Arctic Sea north of Siberia is rapidly rising, and exposing banks of sand con-

taining Mammoth-remains, the land is rapidly gaining on the sea along the whole
coast-line, and successive terraces or beaches are mentioned by Wrangel and
other travellers. The appearance of the tundra seems to point to a not very dis-
tant submergence of the whole of Siberia, as far south as the high lands, which
roughly mark the present northern limit of trees.

   This being so, we have to ask ourselves what causes led to the change of con-
dition of things, and to the extinction of the Mammoth. The hand of man is
quite inadequate, and we must seek for it in the draining of the vast Mediter-

ranean sea, which once existed from the Euxine to the Klingar Mountains, of
which the author gave descriptions from authorities. The drainage of this sea

must have been sudden and overwhelming, and not gradual ; for we find the Mam-

moth remains aggregated in hecatombs on the pieces of high ground, and not
scattered indiscriminately. This alone would account also for such an immediate
change of climate (from an insular one to a continental) as should allow the
bodies of the mammoths to be immediately frozen and thus preserved intact.

On the Source of the Quartzose Conglomerate of the Neiv Med Sandstone of the
    Central portion of England. By Edward Hull, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.

   The source of the peculiar quartzite pebble?, which form the largest proportion
of the Conglomerate beds of the Bunter Sandstone of England, had formed a sub-
ject of inquiry for geologists from the days of the late I)r. Buckland downward.
Professor Ramsay, F.R.S., had shown that the quartz rock of the Lower Lickey

could not have given birth to the vast supplies of these pebbles of quartz, which
were originallj'^ spread over several hundred square miles of country, as this ridge
was buried imder Permian strata at the Triassic period ; and Mr. Hull had come to

the conclusion, on mineralogical grounds, that neither the Carboniferous or Silu-
rian rocks of the north of England or south of Scotland were capable of supply-
ing pebbles of the nature of those found in the Bunter Conglomerate.

   With the exception of a few fragments of Carboniferous and Silurian rocks, the
Bunter Conglomerate was found to consist of rounded pebbles of coloured quartz-

ite. Their invariably roimded form and small size (seldom exceeding 6 inches in
diameter) had for some years suggested to the author that they might have been
subjected to attrition during more than one geological period, and he had antici-

pated that in the Old Red Conglomerate of Scotland the source of these pebbles

might be found.

   Recent visits to the Old Red Conglomerate of Dumbartonshire and the district

of Lesmaliago had conlirmed this anticipation. In these districts the formation
was found to be composed for the most part of pebbles and boulders of quartzite,

Newprecisely similar to the peculiar " liver-coloured " * quartzite pebbles of the

Red Sandstone ; and in proof of this, specimens of the pebbles from the two

formations were exhibited to the Section t-
   This view of the northerly drift of the quartzite pebbles was shown by tlie

author to be in harmony with the stratigraphical arrangement of the Bunter
Sandstone of England, which thins away towards the south-east of the country-;
and the absence in this formation of any of the large boulders of coloured quartz-
ite, such as were found in the Old Red Conglomerate, was attributed to the addi-
tional wear and tear to which the boulders had been subjected in travelling from
Scotland into England, or to the inability of a probably weak oceanic current to
impel blocks of large size to the required distance from their source.

(hi the Action iqwn Earthy Minerals of Water in the Form of heated Steam,
     urged by wood fuel, an experiment reported to the Association at its
    Meeting at Glasgow in 1840. By Julius .Jeffreys, F.R.S.

The experiment was made at Futtehgurh in India, in 1830, its object having

been to determine the action of water in the form of steam at an intense heat, as

a solvent of minerals insoluble in it at lower temperatures.
   The instrument employed was a cylindrical kiln surmounted by a cone, and

interiorly about 30 feet high and 16 in diameter, employed for vitrifying stone-

ware.

Four furnaces, 8 feet long and 4 wide, projected radially from the exterior of

the kiln, and heated it through fire-throats about 3 feet wide and a foot high,

each inrush of fl.inie being allowed in part to flow towards the centre of the kiln,

in part laterally, but the larger portion being turned upwards by dwarf chimneys

in the kiln, built against its sides. These chimneys were as wide as the throats,

say a yard, and about 18 inches from front to back.

For the experiment, a pit was dug between each furnace and the kiln, about

A4 feet wide, .5 deep, and 10 inches broad from front to back.  fire-brick bridge,

or low wall, kept the fuel from falling into the pits. These pits were kept filled

with water.

Specimens of minerals, rock, and stones, and of ceramic ware and fire-brick

were ranged in the fire-chimneys, or fire-bags as they are called by potters, also
on the fioor of the oven, and on the shehes on which were placed a few imbaked

specimens of the stoneware (chiefly bottles for mineral waters), for firing which

the kiln was usually employed.

It should be mentioned that the arched shelves were made of a highly aluminous

and contractile clay, practically infusible, made into bricks (in a manner for de-
scribing which space is not here afforded) so dense that any fragments of them

would scratch glass readily ; whereas the fire-bags were built with an inferior and

much more porous and siliceous brick, nearly similar to English Stoui-bridge,

specimens of these being amongst them.

   The fuel was wood of mango, dawk, and a peculiar light wood from the Tewai
Jungle. These woods abounded in alkali. They gi-ow in the valley of the Ganges,
the soil of which is disintegi-ated mica and felspar.

The ordinary action of high firing with this fuel was to slightly melt the sm-faces

of the fire-bags into a glassy coat, sometimes v\dth tears of glass trickling do-wn,

bm-ning a little slag ; but the dense shelf-bricks were but slightly affected by the

alkali.

After an intense firing of more than forty-eight hours, during which the water

had to be renewed in the pits, on opening the kiln all the glazing had disappeared,

and the minerals in the fire-bags had been reduced in volume. Their walls were

eroded to a depth varjing from one to two inches. The specimens of ware on the

lower shelves were in some places eaten through. The xmbaked stoneware was

fully ^itrified, but the micaceous " slip " glaze on the surfaces, ordinarily a glossy

bro'wn coat, was dissipated, the body of the ware being also eaten into. The dense

brick-shelves were but slightly affected. The specimens of this ware on the

uppermost arch of the kiln, where the heat was not above a full red, were in the

usual state of any ware placed there, viz. under-fired in the body, and coated with
a rich brown glaze, the heat sufficing to melt it. But the surfaces, especially the

--shoulders of the ware, were covered with a mineral hoar-frost a loose incrusta-

tion evidently deposited before the glaze had melted, and under which the ware

had contracted in hardening, so as to raise up the frosty coat more clear of the

and under this crust the glaze-wash had, as the heat rose, melted into a complete

glass.

   What could this incrustation be but a small part of the mineral matter whicli had

been so largely dissolved away below, by steam at an intense heat (aided no doubt
by the alkali in the wood fuel), as to have much exceeded two hundredweight, and
which left trac^es of its flight in a sprinkling of hoar-frost, precipitated at a red heat
the glaze happily intervening to prove that it had a source altogether e.xtrinsic
from the ware on which it had lighted ?

       An Estimate of the quantity of Sedimentmvj Deposit in the Onmj.
                              By the E,er. J. D. L.v Totjche.

   The Onny is a .small stream in the south-west of Shropshire, the waters of
which are collected over an area of 81 square miles. It is well known to geologists

as flowing through the principal strata of the Silurian rocks.

   The following means have been taken to ascertain the rate of denudation of

this valley.

   At the commencement of the present year a gauge-post was erected at a con-

venient spot in the river, at Stokesay, and a register has been kept of the height
of the flood by means of it.

  A number of experiments have been made to determine the maximum surface-

velocity of the stream, and from these a Table (A) has been constructed, which at
a glance gives approximately the mean rate for every decimal of a foot, and the
amount of discharge per minute in cubic feet. For 'this purpose Table VII. in
Neville's ' Hydraulics ' was used.

   At the commencement of each flood, at its full height and decline, specimens of
water were collected in ordinary quart bottles, which contain about 2G ozs. each,
and the sediment after subsiding w<is filtered and accurately weighed, the filter-

Bpaper being first carefully dried. Table is an extract from the register of these

experiments. The entries only include the more important floods.
    The headings of the columns will speak for themselves ; with reference to the

fourth column, it has been found that the number of grains in the 100 ozs. of
water varies considerably with the place from wliich it is taken. That collected
close under the edge of a weir was 20-o per cent, higher than that collected about
thirty yards lower down. The difference is evidently due to the greater disturb-

ance of the water therc^ than elsewhere.

   I think of constructing a filter on a large scale, with wire gauze or some such
material, to be suspended for a certain time under the weir during a flood, to arrest
the coarser sand and pebbles, which cannot be estimated by the foregoing process.

   The fifth column gives the number of pounds of dried sediment which pass down

the stream per minute.

   To give an idea of what may be done with these data, I have made the follow-
ing calculation. The specific gi-avity of dry Silurian rock is about 2-5. Suppo-

sing the highest rainfall and the highest observed percentage of deposit to take
place for six weeks in each year (and this seems to be a very extreme estimate), it
would take 430 years to wear away a single inch of the surface of the valley of the
Onny. Of course this is far from being an accurate estimate, but it is evident
that it would be possible to approach indefinitely near to accuracy by these me.ans,
and therefore to a true estimate of the rate of denudation of the Tand.

    The last column gives the average rainfall of four' rain-gauges placed at different
points of the basin of the Onny.

    [t will be seen that, as might be expected, a certain relation exists between the

sedimentary deposit and the rainfall, though many things tend to interfere. The
suddenness of rain, its occurrence after a drought, or after long-continued wet
weather, will do so. But there is reason to expect that extended observation will

establish a general correlation between the average rainfall and the average rate
of denudation.

On Spheroidal Structure in Silurian Rocks. By the Eev. J. D. La Totjche.

   Spheroidal masses of various sizes are frequently met with in the Siliman and
seme other rocks. In the Wenlock shale smaller nodules, an-anged in lines with

the regularity of bricks in a wall, as well as huge masses of rich limestone, called

ball_ stones, may be observed. These latter concretions give plain evidence of

ha-i-ing been formed subsequently to the deposition of the whole stratum, inas-

Amuch as they have disturbed the lines of stratification both above and below.
discoloration, owing to the inhltration of moisture, is often found to accompany

nodular sh-ucture. The section of an oblong piece of Caradoc sandstone has been

found to exhibit three bands alternately of yellow and blue stone, the former appa-

rently more sandy than the latter. Here not only the coloming, but the physical

character of the stone seemed to have undergone a change from the effects of wea-
Athering.
           railway- cutting at the southern extremity of the Longmynd presents

an instructive example of the same kind. The cubical masses of rock almost

invariably weather into spheroids, the form of which is indicated by fine lines on

the faces of the stone, long before the edges fall oft" and reveal their perfect shape.

   Another veiy beautifid instance may be seen in the Whitclifle, near Ludlow,

where three large spheroids, of several feet in diameter, appear enclosed in concen-
tric layers of Upper Ludlow rock, which suiToimd them like the coats of an onion

the stratification of the general stratum, however, passing through them.

   Has this peciUiar structure been the result of an original deposition of nodules

or calcareous matter at certain spots,- or is it owing to more recent causes ?
   The fact that the shape of nodides fi-equently depends on the shape of the masses

in which they are contained, and that their position is determined by joints in the
rock, also that weathering produces a certain physical change in rocks, rearran-

ging to some extent their materials, would lead to the latter conclusion. It would

appear that if a quantity of soluble or crystallizable matter is equally distributed
through a large mass, and that some external agent, such as moisture, is brought

to bear on it, it may drive inwards the more soluble constituents, produce those
concentric layers above alluded to, and in many cases be the cause of a central

nodule.

   If this be so, we have here further evidence of an incessant change and motion
among the particles of the apparently motionless rocks, suggesting that some
important results are taking place in them, slowly, in immense periods of time.

Notice of remarl-ahle Glacial Strice latehj exposed at Portmadoc.

               By Jonjf Edward Lee, F.S.A., F.G.S.

The object of this notice was to bring before the Section the fact, that probably

one of the best specimens of glacial action had lately been exposed in the small
town of Portmadoc, and will very shortly be destroyed, the locality being wanted

for building-sites. The part now exposed is about 100 feet wide by 50 feet long ·
many of the strife can be traced the whole length. It is nearly a plane, with the

exception of a furrow about 13 inches deep in the middle. Most of the strife run
from S.E. to N.W., but a few run from S.S.E. to N.N.W. (magnetic).
                                                                    The ano°-le
of inclination varies from 14J to 16°.
As the plane slopes to the N.W., and the hill behind is comparatively low,

while the highest gi-ound in the neighbourhood is almost immediately in front

though on the other side of the vaUey, it would appear that if the glacier which
caused these strife originated in the highest gi-ound, it must have taken a sudden
turn when nearing the shore. If this is not thought probable, there must have
been two sets of glaciers meeting in the valley.

        Denudation of Western Brittany. By G. A. Lebotjr, F.R.G.S.

   The conclusions brought forward in this paper are as follows :
   1. That, with the exception of a central range of hills of elevation, Western Brit-
tany consists of two great plains of viarine denudation.
96 REPORT--1869.

    2. Tliat the last time tliese plains ^N-crc exposed to tbc levelliug action of the
sea was probably duriug the Upper (;') Miocene period.

    .3. That the rivers of this district are identical, at least iu their higher regions,
with those which flowed formerly from tlie central diy land into the Miocene sea.

   4. That the valleys at the bottom of which these rivers run are the result of

their own erosive action, aided bj' other subaerial agents.

    .5. That the uniformity of width and depth of these vallej's is due to the degree
of hardness of the rocks in this country, being in an order of succession exactly
corresponding to the time during which they have been exposed to the action

of subaerial denudation.

             On the Gold of Natal By R. J. Mann, M.D., F.B.A.S.

     On the Traitpean Conglomerates of Middletown Hill, Montgomeryshire.
                          By G. Maw, F.G.S., F.L.S., F.S.A.

   This was a description of the contemporaneous traps of Lower Silurian age ia
the ridge known as Middletown Hill, running parallel with the Breiddens, on the
borders of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire. Especial refei-ence was made to the
great beds of bouldered trap, consisting of boulders of compact felstone imbedded
in a softer matrix of felspathic tuti" The nodules occupy about half the mass of
the conglomerate, and are unaccompanied by pebbles of any other rock. They
vary from the size of a walnut to rounded masses of more than a hundredweight.
Sir R. Murchison's description of these beds was referred to, and the author took
exception to the term "concretionary trap " employed in the ' Silurian Sy.stem,'as
he considered that the rounded outline of the boulders was unquestionably due
to }nechanical causes. The interbedded traps, bounded on either side by Lower

Llandeilo Flags, are of a collective thickness of about 780 feet, including

bouldered felstone, alternating with a whitish-green felspathic breccia. The line
of separation between the breccia-bed and boulder-trap is remarkably sudden, and
no gradation of character occurs between them. The breccia is worked for hard
felspar used for pottery purposes, and contains small nests of steatite. The boul-
dered condition of the felstone-bed was considered due to its partial breaking
up on being erupted under water, the soft matrix of felspathic tutf being the por-
tion more intimately divided, and the compact boulders fragments that had re-
sisted disintegration. The sudden alternation in Middletown Hill of eruptive
beds of very dissimilar character was noticed ; they seem to have been emitted
in immediate succession, as, although overlain and underlain by sedimentary
deposits, there is no evidence of interstratification of sedimentary beds. The

author, in conclusion, pointed out the close geographical association with these

bedded traps of the much later porphyritic greenstone of the Breidden Hills,

which, it was suggested, might have been emitted from the same point of erup-
tion ; and the local association of the intrusive gi-eenstone with the Lower Silurian
interbedded felstones was noticed as being very general in North Wales.

    ExjJeriments on Contortion of Mountain Limestone. By L. C. Miall.

   The author cited previous experiments illustrating the behaviour of various
materials when subjected to pressure, and briefly' described the geological pheno-

mena of contortion. An apparatus was exhibited, which had been prepared to

produce artificial contortions in laminre of rock, and to ascertain the amount of
defiection capable of being caused by sudden and continuous strains respecti^·ely.

   The lamina is clamped at one end to a block, the length to be bent is regulated
by sliding the block along a groove, and a known weight descends upon the free
end. Provision is made that the weight shall act upon a knife-edge, which is
always perpendicular to the surface of the slab, and ahvays applied to the same

line. By means of an index the deflection can be read accurately to hundredths

of an inch.

  AIn the annexed Table the results of one series of experiments are given.

number of observed facts are neglected in order to give prominence to the chief
point, viz. the difference in the deflections produced hy the sudden application of a
considerable weight, and by the prolonged action of a force of low intensity. The
angles have been deduced from the amount of perpendicular deflection, and they

are consequently all taken as rectilinear.

                                          On some New Forms of Graptolites *.
                                  By H. Alletne Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc, M.A.

  In this comniuuication tlie author described twelve new species of Graptolites,
which had recently come under his notice. Of these, six were from the Skiddaw
Slates, raising the total number of Graptolites from this formation to thirty-four.

Three were from the Graptolitic Mudstones of the Coniston series, making, with
those already described by the author, a total of twenty-seven species (see Quart.
Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxiv.). The remaining three were from the Upper Llan-

deilo rocks of Dumfriesshire.

   The following is a list of the species here described :

Trigonograpsus lanceolatus.       DiplogTapsus Hughesi.
Dichograpsus fragilis.
                                            sinuatus.
          annulatus.              Graptolites argenteus.
                                  Diplogi-apsus insectiformis.
Didymograpsus fasciculatus,
Diplograpsus Hopkinsoni.                   bimucronatus.
                                  Climacograpsus innotatus.
         armatus.

Sketch of the Granite of the Northerly and Easterly Sides of Dartmoor.

                  By G. Waeeing ORifEEOD, M.A., F.O.S.

The district known popularly as "Dartmoor" consists of the forest of that

name, and portions of the adjoining parishes                                                                                                                                                                                                          it  is estimated as being twenty-two
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

miles from north to south, and twenty from east to west, and is formed of granite

or granitoid rocks. The gi-anite, for the most part, is a coarse-grained mixture of

quartz, felspar, and mica, which is sometimes white ; large crystals of felspar are

often seen, and schorl or tourmaline is of very frequent occurrence both in veins

and as an integral part of the rock ; near Chagford the author has found scapoHte.

The granite to the north of the Teign is more crystalline than that to the south of

that river. The rock-basins, with very few exceptions, are in the district south

of the Teign. Perpendicular j oiuts often occur ; tlie greater part have a direction from

N.N.W. to S.S.E., and other lines run at right angles to these. The joints that

have an easterly and westei-ly dfrection vary more from the perpendicular than

the others. Minor lines of joints, which cross at rather acute angles, give a ba-

saltiform character to the rocks in which they occur ; these occupy only small
areas. The sides of joints are sometimes smooth and shining, and of a dark co-

lour, caused by schorl, and the faces are occasionally intersected bj' numerous

minute lines, which penetrate about an inch. The beds of granite rarely exceed

2 feet in thickness, and the adjoining beds, whether horizontal or pei-pendicular,

often differ in character. The division of granite into tabidar masses and beds

having a stratiform appearance, is very general ; and the beds are occasionally seen

to curve beneath the schistose rocks (as near Belstone Tors)^ and to dip to the valleys

on each side of the range, probably causing the contour of the district, as at

Kestor and Middletor, between the North and South Teigns. To the south of the

Teign a spheroidal structure occurs, and masses resembling boulders are seen in

situ in deca^-ing granite ; a good example exists near the Lustleigli Station, and to

this peculiar structure the forms of the gi'anite masses, often regarded as trans-

ported blocks, is in a gi-eat degree to be attributed. The Elvans of Dartmoor do

not equal those of Cornwall either in size or extent ; veins of gi-anite of the same

composition as the adjoining gi-anite often penetrate the neighbouring sedimentary

rocks                             these can be studied near Chagford, on the left bank of the Teign, at Hunt's
                               ;

Tor and Sharpy Tor; at Sharpy Tor the vein is about 18 feet wide, and contains

large crystals of felspar, and masses of the adjoining carbonaceous rock. Veins of

porph^-i-y rarely occur ; a vein of coarse poq^hp-y containing pseudo-opal is ex-

posed in the farmyard at Forder near Easton, and" also at Sandy Park ; and a vein

of fine-gi-ained porphyry may be seen on the old road from Moreton Ilampstead to

Exeter, near the cross of the roads at the top of the hill. The decay of gra-

nite was next noticed ; various particulars as to granite-gravel were pointed out,

and the manner in which the perpendicular joints, the stratiform beds, and the
spheroidal structure combine to produce the tors and rocking-stones, and the
most characteristic features of the moor.

   In conclusion, the author said that he had not seen any glacial markings on the
Dartmoor granite, but that Professor Otto Torrell, when visiting the Moor with
him last autumn, gave an unqualified opinion that many of the gravels were the
remains of moraines.

Notice of the Discovery of Organic Remains in the Rods hetiveen the Nare Head
            and Porthalla Cove, Cornwall. By C. W. Peach, A.L.S.

  In May last, after assisting to arrange a collection of Cornish fossils in the new
Museum of the Geological Society of Cornwall, at Penzance, the author examined

there the interesting series of the rock specimens of Cornwall, made by Dr. Boase
many years ago, to see whether any of them contained organisms. One of them, a

dark limestone, marked 733, from Porthalla Cove, attracted his attention ; it evi-

dently contained organisms which were so indistinct that they had hitherto escaped

notice.

The authorities kindly had it rubbed down and polished, and thus Encrinites and

a coral, probably Favosites pohpnorpha, were well shown.

   Owing to this interesting discovery, the author resolved to visit the spot and to

try to find the rock in situ. He met with a few specimens of blackened remains,

enclosed in a dark slaty rock, between tide-marks, in Nelly's Cove, called " Betsey's

Cove " at page 95 of the ' Geology of Cornwall, Devon, &c.,' by the late Sir Henry
De la Beche. One of the specimens shows one septum of an Orthoceras and part of

another. The others are evidently portions of organisms. Similar blackened

Orthocerites, Szc. are not imcommon in a similar kind of rock at Fowey, Polruan,

&c.                   many  such                            obtained  there  by  the  author  are  in  the  Museum    at  Penzance.
                   ;

Those from Nelly's Cove are to be added to them.

On the alleged occurrence of Hippopotamus major a7id Machairodus latidens
              in Kent's Cavern. By W. Pengellt, F.R.S., F.G.S.

The author, having reminded palaeontologists that Prof. Owen (Brit. Foss. Mam.

&c. pp. 410 and 175, &c.) had mentioned Hippopotamus major and Machairochis
latidens as having been found in Kent's Hole, and that the late Dr. Falconer had

not been convinced that either of them had been met with there, proceeded to give,

in each case, a brief summary of the evidence furnished, first, by the published and

impublished statements of the early explorers of the Cavern, Mr. Northmore, Mr.

(now Sir) W. C. Trevelyan, Rev. J. M'Enery, Rev. Dr. Buckland, and Mr. God-

win-Austen                                                  secondly, by their figures of the specimens they found ;  and, thirdly,
                                                         ;

by the specimens themselves.

The following are the chief conclusions at which he anived :

1st. That there is no trustworthy evidence that Hippiopiotamus major had been

found in the Cavern.

2nd. That Mr. M'Enery found five canines of Machairodus latidens there.

   3rd. That at present one of the five is in the British Museum, one in the Museum
of the Royal College of Surgeons, one in the Museum of the Geological Society of
London, one in the Oxford Museum, and one in the private collection of Sir W. C.

Trevelyan.

                       By WiniAM Pengellt, F.R.S., F.G.S.

  MawIn this communication the author stated, in reply to some remarks by Mr.

(Quart. Joum. Geol. Soc. vol. sxiii. pp. 392-393, 1867), that he had been led to the
conclusion (Phil. Trans, part ii. 1862, p. 1027) that the clays in question were
derived from the degradation of the Dartmoor granite, by the following facts :

   First, the proximity to Dartmoor ; secondly, tliat all the beds of clay and of sand
thin out eastward, that is, with increased distance from Dartmoor; thirdly, the beds
                                                                                                                                                     ;

of sand thin out in that direction before the beds of clay, and the coarse beds of

each kind before  those  which  are                                       finer                               fourthly,  because the beds  of sand,  and
                                                                                                           ;

especially the " twentj'-seventh," are little more or less than disintegrated granite,

being made up of quartz frequently unrounded, crystals of felspar sometimes quite

angular, and grains of schorl ; and fifthly, because of the presence of sand in the

clay-beds, and of clay in those of unmistakeable granitic sand.

Denudation of the Shroj>sliire and South Staffordshire Coal-fields,

                             By John Eandall.

The author described a line of denudation in the Shropshire coal-field, familiarly

known as the Symon Fault, in which the coals and ironstones disappear in succes-

sion, more particularly at theKemberton audHalesfield pits, in the Madeley Wood

Co.'s Field, where it was stated that the workmen of one pit were stripping the

Fault in the top coal, whilst workmen in the adjoining pit were doing the same

thing in the clod coal, 60 yards lower down, and 'JOO yards nearer to what is sup-

posed to be the trough of the estuary, which would give a slope of 1 in 15. In

some instances portions of coal were stated to have been broken off and rounded by

the action of waves  or  currents                                         in others, as                       at  the Hill's  Lane and Shaw Field
                                                                       ;

pits, the strata on approaching the line of denudation was disturbed, and often

vertical. Instances were also given, as at Caughley, where the measures having

been denuded, excepting the lowest, a younger series had been formed above them

and again, as at Linley, where, the whole of the older series having entirety disap-

peared, a younger group rested u])on Old Red Sandstone. Looking at the island-

like form of the Brown Clu Hills, and at the wide tracts from which the coal-

measures had been swept clean away to the south, and along what might be

supposed to be the mouth of the estuary, also at tlie result of the borings made

through the red rocks, and at the fact that first the Permians, then the Banter, and

lastly the Keuper sandstones came in one after the other as receding from the coal-

field, the author was of opinion that for sixteen miles (that is, from the margin of

the Shropshire to that of the Staffordshire coal-fields) the measures had been swept

away, with the exception of such portions only as might have been saved by de-

pression, the results of faults prior to denudation, or others to the north-east in the

direction of Cannock Chase, which might have been out of reach of the waters of

the estuary.

The author added that, so far as he was aware, there was nothing on the oppo-

site or western side of the South Staffordshire coal-field inconsistent with this view.

There were perhaps a greater number of slip faults on that side on approaching the

western boundary of the coal-field, but these and similar facts, when read by the

light of those found on the Shropshire side, afforded grave reasons for further

inquiry, if not for the belief that either hy some strait or estuaiy the coal-measures

had, with the exception hinted at, been destroyed over a very Avide surface.

number of the known fossils of this country did not amount to 30. It was
also stated that the treatise on the geology of Asia Minor, of which this work
was a part, had been lately completed. In conclusion, a reference was made to the
flattering notice of this work by Sir Roderick Murchison in his last Address to the

Geographical Society.

   At the Nottingham Meeting, the author presented to the Association a topo-
graphical and geological map of Asia Minor, and on that occasion gave a sketch

of the principal geological features of Asia Minor.

On neiu forms of Pteroplax and other Carhoniferous Lahyrinthodonts, and
   other Megalichthys. By James Thomson (Glasyow), F.G.S. With Notes

   on their Structure, by Professor Young.

   During the past year the author has continued his investigations into the ver-

tebrate forms of the Lanarkshire Coal-iield, and has added many specimens of

reptiles and fishes to those brought under the notice of the Meeting last year.

Some of them are so well marked as to supply characters sufficient to admit of them

being referred to their systematic position, and he had been fortunate in securing

the cooperation, for their anatomical description, of Professor Young of the Glasgow
University. The author anticipated that in the course of the next year Professor
Young would be able to figure and describe them in a way which will satisfy the

systematic or anatomical student.

   They are found resting upon a thin seam of coal, which varies from five to fifteen
inches in thickness : upon the surface of this coal there occurs a thin seam of shale,
which forms a parting between the coal below and an ironstone band aljove. It is
in this parting that the remains are found, and to the fact of their having been
imbedded in the soft pulpy mass of the shale may be attributed the perfect state
of preservation in which they are found. In tlie superimposed ironstone are also
found similar remains, but owing to the hard matrix, they are seldom obtained in
good preservation.

   The ironstone belongs to the Upper Coal-measures, and represents a basin of
limited extent, and is situated upon the south side of the river Avon. The same
stratum has been identified in other parts of the Lanarkshire coal-field, but in no
place have there been discovered so many fossil remains as at Quarter, and it is to
be regretted that, from the limited extent of the basin and the length of time it
has been wrought, it is now almost exhausted, and a few weeks will terminate the

present workings.

                       Notes on their Structure, by Professor Young.

Megalichthys. The following species were defined from specimens in Mr. Thom-

son's cabinet, obtained from the Lanarkshire coal-field :

31. Hibherti. Scale covered with tine-grained, smooth, glossy enamel. In this

species occurs most frequently that imperfect development of ganoin referred to

in Q. J. Geol. Soc. 1866, pp. 6()7-8.

M. coccolepis, n. sp. Scale usually of a rich brown colour, set with stellar

tubercles, recalling the " berry-bone " of the Old Red Sandstone.

covered with asperities more or less confluent, never stellar. "With this scale is

associated a tooth which Dr. Young described as diagnostic of I'homhoptychius

(Q. J. Geol. Soc. 1866; p. 606), but which turns out to be common to two -distinct

genera.

                      On Teeth and Dermal Structure associated with Ctenacanthus.
                                           By James Thomson, F.G.S.

The author stated that he had discovered in the spring of this year, in the

neighbourhood of Airdrie, Lanarkshire, a slab of ironstone measuring 30x14-

inches ; although only a fragment, yet it exhibits, 1st, a mass of shagreen ; 2nd, two
spines of Ctenacanthus major 3rd, a nimiber of teeth, Chuhchis mirabilis, Agassiz,

                                                                                                                                                              ;

evidently in their proper relative position, the slightly curved line in which they

are disposed suggesting the contour of the mouth, and Ipng at a higher level than

those which were exposed ; 4th, a fragment of a small spine, the cross section of
which gives as its outline a spherical triangle with the posterior side less than the

others ; the anterior face is round and smooth, while the posterior face is flat. Along
the margins of the posterior face there are two rows of pointed tubercles curving in-

wards and downwards. Being thus formed on the upper surface of the head, it is

natural to infer that it was situated on the occipital region of the fish. This in-

ference is supported by subsequently finding another spine imbedded in another

slab, which, like the former, is associated with the teeth of Cladudus mirahilis.

  On removing the ironstone from the underside of the slab immediately over the

mouth, the author laid bare the skin, and found imbedded on its surface numerous

minute bodies, consisting of two, three, and four curved diverging points rising from

an expanded base, from which a sharp keel on the convex side passed to the apex of

each.

   On other parts of the slab are found similar bodies, larger than those found on the

crown of the head, but possessing similar tooth-like characters, divided into two,

to examine, were found a mass of similar teeth-like bodies, which exhibited similar

characters, in one instance divided into fifteen divergent points, and also associated

with the teeth of Cladodus.

In another slab, found at the same place and at the same time, were im-

bedded in a patch of shagi-een the so-called teeth of Diphdus c/ihhosm, very nu-

merous, and crowded together without order. "VVe have associated with these

another form of teeth-like tubercles, smooth, enamelled and circular in section

they are relatively larger, while the recui-ved apex is more pointed than the tu-

bercles before described ; they are occasionally found in patches of greater numbers
in some instances in clusters of eight and nine, and are attached to broad flat bases.

Finding such an amount of co-related evidence, the author prepared microscopic

sections of patches which were detached from the mass. After doing so, he was led to

refer to the results of other investigators, and found that Professor Owen had got

forwarded to him from Mr. Craggs similai' forms found in the Newcastle coal-field,

and which he described in a paper read to and published by the Odontological So-

ciety. He describes them as teeth, some of which he names Ditodus diverffens,

Mitrodus quadricormis, Ochhdus crassus, Gastrodus ^trepositus.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      103

   In a paper by Messrs. Hancock and Atthey, published in the Northumberland
and Dui'ham Natural-History Society's Transactions, they describe similar bodies,
which they found attached to patches of shagreen, and much resembling those
found in the Scottish beds.

   As some of the forms described by Professor Owen agree in detail with the sec-
tions made by himself, the author felt much puzzled at finding the different forms

distributed over and attached to the same shagreen ; in order to arrive at a some-
what satisfactory conclusion, he examined a number of the recent Rays.

   Founding on the analogy of existing rays his conclusions are :
   1st. That the two spines of Ctenacanthus belonged to the same animal, both pro-

bably spines of dorsal fins, the smaller being the anterior.

   2nd. That the animal was provided with the teeth known as Cladodus of Agassiz,
   3rd. That the body of the animal was covered with fine shagreen.
   4th. That among this fine investure were scattered large structures of i)(^Mi«s of
authors, which stand to the shagreen in the same relation as does the placoid ar-

mature to the fine denticulate tubercles of existinir Rays.
   5th. That among the living forms the sexual differences are to be noticed in the

dermal development, differences which find their probable coimterpart in the fossils.
The dermal characters in the fossils are those of Rays.

   Whether the views here stated be accepted or rejected, the author hopes the
identification attempted may serve as a basis for further observation.

Old Red Sandstone of Forfarshire.

  He referred to the finding of S. Symondsii in Herefordshire, a species agreeing
in size with the S. Pown'ei of Forfarshire, and showed that in the new species we

have evidence in Herefordshire of a crustacean belonging to the Merostomata and
to the genus Stylonurus as large as the great S. Scoticus. The specimens (which

formation of new reservoirs and filtering-ljecls by tlie East London Waterworks
Company. Two new resen-nirs are now being made, covering 120 acres in extent,
and of an average depth of 10 feet. The " puddle-walls " are excavated to a depth
of about 25 feet. The materials removed are all of posttertiary age, consisting of

surface soil, loamy clay, peat, sliell-marl, coarse and tine sands, rounded and sub-
angular gravels from tlie Challc and Woolwich series, with pebbles of chert and
sandstone from the older rocks. The deposit is rich in vegetable remains, the peat
 attaining a thickness of tliree feet, and containing evidences of the oak, the alder,
the liazel, and other trees and plants. The sbell-marl is at places equally thick, and
is rich in shells, twenty-six species having been detenuined by the author. The
bivalve shells are still united, and the Fahidi/KT See. have their opercula still in

place. Of the animals may be mentioned humaji remains and works of art of the
stone, bronze, and iron age. The wolf, the fox, the beaver, horse, wild-boar, red

 deer, roebuck, fallow deer, reindeer, the elk, the goat, three oxen (including £os
p->>iii(/('imis, B. lo7if/ifro/is, and li. fronfosiis), the sea-eagle and some iish-remaius
 complete the list. In the deep trenches of the puddle-walls tusks of the JMani-

moth and horns of the gigantic Bos and Cerrua have been found. Mr. A. W.

 Franks, F.S.A., Keeper of the Ethnographical Collections in the British Museum,
 has obtained from this deposit a flint scraper, two bronze spear-heads, one bronze
 arrow-head, one bronze knife, an iron sword (late-Celtic), bronze sheath, a Kini-

 meridge-clay armlet, a pierced axe-head of stag's horn, a bone knife, a stag's horn,
 club, various earthen pots (some hand-made and some turned on the wheel),

 besides many cut bones. In 1-300 all Essex was one vast forest. In 1154 the
 forest of Middlesex commenced at Iloundsditch and extended north and east for
 many miles, and the forest is described as abounding in wolves, wild boars, stags,
 and wild bulls. The Walthamstow marshes have not been disaflbrested more
 than 100 years. Of the antiquity of these deposits no doubt can exist, for the
 presence of the reindeer, the elk (determined by Professor Owen), and the beaver

  is conclusive. Their preservation so near the surface is entirely due to the pro-
  tective intiuenee of forest vegetation, which has precluded the inroads of agri-

  culture. The author expressed his belief that the deposits indicated, at places, the
  efl'ects of beaver-works, tracts of forest having been to all appearance submerged
  and destroyed by the action of beaver-dams.

  Allow me on taking possession of this chair to say, as a resident of Devonshire,
  how gratified we all feel at receiving you as Members of this Association. It is
   now nearly thirty years since this county had the honour of last receiving you. In
   the year 1840 you paid a visit to Plymouth. You were then a Society young in
   years, with many and powerful enemies to contend against. Since that time you

   have grown in dimensions, and become a power in the State, and second to none in
   your influence on, and encourngement of, science among the generally educated
    masses of the country.

      With the importance that the Society has assumed, has sprung rxp a natural and
   honourable rivalry among ihe more important towns in the country as to which
   shall have the honour of receiving you. On this occasion the good fortune has
   fallen to Exeter, and well we are assured that the hospitality of Devonshire may

    be trusted in the safe keeping of the " Ever-faithful City.*'

       But this desire to show welcome to you is not confined to this town ; the ex-
    cursions to Plymouth, Toiquay, Bideford. &c. are evidence of a wish on the
    part of the inhabitants of the county generally to bid you welcome, and to receive
    you heartily ; nay, this desire is not confined to Devonshire, but further west ; in

Cornwall the Natural-History Society of Penzance has projected an excursion to

the Land's End, to visit the Driiidic remains of interest in that district. This they

have arranged so as to suit the convenience of such members who, after the Meet-

ing, may like to extend their visit to that locality.

To the Members of the Association who are interested in this Section these two
Acounties must ever have peculiar features of interest.
                                                                                peninsula iuttino- out

from the rest of England, surrounded on all sides by the Atlantic Ocean, with

the exception of a narrow neck of land of about thirty miles in length, must have

features exclusive its own.

 --This position gives it a peculiarity of climate, a circumstance which also has its

influence ou its vegetation as well as on its animal life. The isothermal line of

these counties is that of nearly the southern part of Europe. This can be best

appreciated in the fact that the glowworm may be seen to shine in December, and

strawberries not imfrequently gathered at Christmas. Perhaps there is no part of

Enjilaud that affords such varied contrast as may be seen in this county. The

wild and rocky district of the north, the uncultivated waste of Dartmoor, together

with the fertile valleys of the southern shores, offer every inducement to naturalists

to extend their researches in their interesting paths of science.

   The narrow neck of land that separates the ancient Damnonia from the rest of

England lies between Bridgewater Bay and Lyme Regis, a line running nearly due

north and south. It is one, moreo^·er, which corresponds witli the most westerly

limit of the Nightingale. This in itself has long been a subject of interest to the

inhabitants of these couuties. That it is not due to food we think is evident ; for

in the more northerly latitudes the sweet songster keeps nearly to the same line of

longitude, and appears to avoid the western district of ^^'ales also.

   The inffuence of the geological character of soil in the growth of plants
may be well studied here. Examples may be seen in the luxuriant condition of

the elm-trees, when growing in the Red Sandstone valleys of this neighbourhood;

while the oak may be seen to flourish as a weed in the abimdant coppice, on

the slaty and granitic soils of the western extremity of the county. Perhaps to

the botanist no more curious and interesting sight can be seen in the west than

that of Wistman's Wood. In the heart of Dartmoor has continued, without appa-
rently any young growth, a grove of oaks that have been recorded in the Duchy

annals within a short period of the Norman Conquest. Here for a thousand

years these knarled and knotted trees have spread out their branches and sent

forth their green leaves every year, without apparently having the power to grow

higher than some few feet above a tall man's head. Their roots are amongst the

granite boulders, from which apparently they can procure no nom-ishment. They

exist as one of the greatest botanical wonders of the county.

But there are more notable distinctions than that of "geological conditions to

account for the distribution of plants. On the slope of the Dartmoor hiU-sides

every tourist must have noticed long grassy trackways where the turf has never

been encroached upon by the heather that luxuriantly flourished on either side.
Here is a suggestive hint that the chemist would be of service. It demonstrates

how nearly one branch of science is dependent upon another.

There are many plants more or less common in this county, which the botanist

will not flnd, or only rarely, in other parts of England.

To the zoologist, this western peninsula must have much of interest. Dr. Leach

and Col. Montagu stand side by side as pioneers in British zoology. They made
most of their collections in Devonshire, and it is but within a few weeks that their

old companion, Charies Prideaux of Kingsbridge, died, leaving his coUecrion, many

specmiens of wliich were procured  in  company                       with  Dr.  Leach  and  Col.  Montaou
                                                                  '

On alteration in the Structure of Lychnis diurna, observed in connexion iviih

         the development of a parasitic fungus. By Lydia E. Becker.

   Specimens were produced of the common red campion. Lychnis diurna, infested
with a parasitic fungus allied to the " smut" in wheat, which fungus developes its
fructification in the anthers of the ilower. The campion, in its ordinary healthy

state, has flowers bearing stamens only, or pistils only, but about half the plants
infested with the parasitic fungus bear flowers with both stamens and pistils in the

same flower. The writer had never seen bisexual flowers on healthy plants, and
attributed the occurrence of that condition in the specimens produced to the pre-
sence of the parasitic fungus. The diseased plants very rarely produced capsules,
but occasionally, late in the season, perfect capsules, bearing good seed, are found

on them. A few of these flowers had been submitted to Mr. Charles Darwin, and

he had suggested that the pollen beino: destroyed at an early period, the pistil
was developed in compensation. But though this explanation appeared probable
at first sight, further examination of the facts did not seem to sustain it. The
writer believed the influence exerted by the pollen to be of a niucli more subtle
and surprising character than this, and that instead of causing the development of
a pistil in a plant that would have produced stamens only if left to itself, the
fungus has the power to cause a plant which in its natural condition would have
produced pistils only, to develope stamens for the accommodation of the parasites.
She supposed that the spores of the fungus fell on the stigma of the flower, and
infested all the seeds produced by that capsule ; that of these, all the seeds which
would naturally have produced plants bearing stamens only remain imaffected in
structure, but they have their pollen destroyed by it ; that those which would
naturally have produced pistils only develope these to a certain extent ; but as the
fungus which pervades the tissues of the campion cannot produce spores without
anthers to fructify in, it compels the plant it inhabits to develope these for its
accommodation, and the eftbrt of so doing exhausts the forces of the plant, and
causes the decay of the capsule, if indeed the previous stunting of the style does
not prevent fertilization. The parasite comes like a cuckoo, establishes itself in
the flower of the campion, and in order to nourish and find accommodation for
the spores of the stranger its own oflspring perishes. The production of healthy

capsules late in the season may be accounted for by supposing that the vigour of

the fungus becomes exhausted, and the pressure being removed the plant resumes
its natural functions. The fact that only about half the diseased plants are bi-
 sexual favours the theory that the latter are female plants, in which the growth of
stamens has been induced by the presence of the fungus.

On the Fauna of British India, and its relations to the EtMopian and so-

    called Indian Fauna. By William T. Blanfokd, F.G.S., C.M.Z.S.

In the various works  published of late                                                                                                                    years  on  the  geographical                   distribution
               ^

of animals, it has been almost invariably assumed that the fauna of India proper

and the Malay countries is identical.  This is not the case, however                                                                                                                                      the  fauna of
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

the Himalayas, especially to the eastward, is purely Malay, and that of the hills

along the Malabar coast and in Ceylon has very marked Slalay affinities ; but the

fauna of the plains of India generally is, if anything, more closely allied to that of

Africa than to that of Malayasia.

    Illustrations of this tact were given from the Mammals, Birds, and terrestrial

Mollusca, these being chosen as having been most carefully examined, and their

range most accurately ascertained. Thus, taking the common larger mammals

found in the very centre of India around Nagpiir, excluding small rodents and

Cheiroptera, because their range is less accurately known, it is found that one

belongs to a genus peculiar to India, nine to genera common to Africa and the
Malay countries, eleven to genera, viz. Mellivora, Cynailurm, Hyana, Cam's

(two species), Vidjjes, Lepus, Antilope, and Gazella, found also in Africa,' but wanting
in the Malay countries, and only live to forms, viz., Presbytis, Cuon, Rusa, Axis,
and GavePHs, represented in the Malay countries, but not in Africa. Of the species

two are common both to Malayasia and Africa, sixteen are peculiar to India, four
(Felis tif/ris, Cuon rutilans, Eusa Aristotelis, and Gavmis gaunis) extend to the

eastward into the Malay countries, but not to the westward, while three others

{Felis chaus, Cynailurm jiihatvs, and Hycena striata) are common to Africa and

India, but extend no further to the east. The generic lists, however, give a far
more fair view of the real affinities of the Central-Indian fauna, because many

Bm-Indian forms, like Mellivoi-a indica, Canis aureus, Lepus rujivordutus, Gazella

7iettii, are scarcely separable as geographical races from those inhabiting the distant
Ethiopian region, while such forms as Axis mamlatus and Prochilus lahiatus,

although represented in the much less distant Malay countries, are replaced there
by forms differing much more widely, and indeed classed by many naturalists in

distinctgenera. Also it shoidd be noticed that the African "and Pahearctic types
(excluding Himalayan animals), which extend to India but no further to the south-

east, comprise the Hyanidce, Canidm (with the sole exception of Cuon), Leporida,
and Antelopidm, whilst the only great family of Mammals, which extends to India
from the Malay countries, and is not found in Africa south of the Atlas, is the

Ce)-vid(e (Busincs).

The  same is seen amongst the Birds                                                                                                                        for instance Neophron, Pterocles, and Otis

All are either found in Africa or represented by closely-allied forms, but not found

or closely represented in the Malay countries. On the other hand, there are

several Malay types equally abundant, as

   But in most cases these are more or less represented in Africa, wliilst a larger
number of the Afi-ican tj'pes have no closely allied forms in the Malay regions.

   In Bengal, however, Orissa, Malabar, and Ceylon, Malay forms are much more

largely represented, while the African types disappear. Throughout the southern
portion of the peninsula of India, south of the Kistna river, several pecuhar forms
occur, like Presbi/tis Prinmus, Macacus radiafiis, Tapaia Elliotici, Lepus nigricoUis,
some of which have Malayan affinities, though by no meaus all.

   The distribution of the Carnivora and Ruminants was discussed, and that of the
Birds also treated at some length. Amongst the operculated laud-shells it was
shown that the Cyclophoruhfi, which are chiefly developed in Malayasia, extend-
ing to South America, though largely represented in India, are almost confined to
the Bengal, Malabar, and Ceylouese subprovinces, whilst Cydotopsis, a genus of
 Cyclostomidce, a family widely developed in Southern Europe and parts of Africa,

is widely distributed over India.

   It was further shown that, although many of the Afi-ican animals belonged to

desert types, others, such as Pferocles hifasciatus, Otis aurita, Tocktis yinyalensis,

belono- to African bush or forest forms, and the absence of species of such marked
forest birds as the Treroniclfp and BiK-erotidee, except those most nearly allied to
African tj'pes in the forests of Central and Western India, was commented upon.

   The e.xtraordinary divergence in the migratory birds of Bengal and Western
India received notice. Besides the better known cases, it was shown that Circus
melanoleucos, Erythrosterna leucura, and Gallinayo sphenura were confined, so far

as is knowTi, to the eastern portion of India, whilst Erythosterna parva, at least

five species of Saxicola, Emheriza Huttoni, two species of Euspiza, Circus cyaneus,
 Cotyle rupestris, and others, are only found in the West and Centre.

   In Upper Burma there are a few forms with Indian affinities, which are not

represented in the !Malay countries proper. Such are Lepus peyuensis, the Jackal

 (perhap" introduced), Francolinus peyuensis, Pericrocotus albifrons, a, Chattarhcea,

&c., and two African or desert forms of land shells, Pupa insularis and P. cceno-

picta.

    Altogether it was considered that India proper was not an integral portion of
the Malay zoological province, but a border land containing a mixture of the
Malay ani ^Ethiopian faunas, and it was suggested that the name Indian region
might be advantageously changed to Mala}', as the emploj-nient of the former

 involves error.

TrichiaJlayeUifer was discovered on shoots of Spruce Fir in the winter of 1865,

by the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, since which time it has occurred more abundantly on
rotten stems of Puhus fruiicosus. The specific name was given to it on account of

the threads or elaters being repeatedly divided at their ends, thus resembling small

Ascourges.  more careful examination of its structure was made in the winter of

1868, and the result showed that it forms a connecting link between the genera

Trichia and Physorum, po.«sessing the spiral threads of the former combined with

the adnate capillitium of the latter. Fries describes the capillitium of Trichia as

"densely interwoven, and its threads adnate at the base," by which he means, as

the context shows, that the threads are attached to each other, but not to the

peridia. Corda, in his ' Icones,' followed by Wigand, 'Annales des Sciences' for

1862, describes the capillitium of Trichia as developed freely in the centre of

the peridium. Wigand says that " sections of the peridium of TAi'c7»'a show the

capillitium occupying generally the cential cavity of the peridium, the mass of

spores filling the .'·pace intermediate between the capillitium and the walls of the

peridium, and that the individual elaters are generally simple, or only slightly

branched, and detached from each other, and characterized by spiral projections."

In the nearly related genus Arcyria the threads of the capillitium ofttn form reti-

culations by their adhesion to one another, and are distinguished from the threads

of Trichia by annidar, or unilateral, instead of spiral prominences. Abnormal

slaters of Trichia furcata are figured by Wigand, combining the spiral threads of

Trichia with the annular structure of Arci/ria in one and the same elater, showino'

the close affinity of the two genera. The elaters of all the species of Trichia known

previous to the discovery of T.Jlac/eUifer are pointed at each end, and not attached

to tbe peridium. In the genus Phi/sarum the branched threads are adnate to the

peridia at or near the base, as in Trichia Jiariellifer, but they have no spiral pro-

jections. Physarum metallicum, Berkl., e'xhibits other characters, found also in

Trichia fiacjellifer , viz. a metallic lustre on its peridium, and ilesh-coloured spores.
The latter plant is thus described in the ' Annals of Natural History ' for 1866 :

*^ Trichia Jiaijellifer^  n. sp. giobosa sessilis, metallica;  flocci apice flagelliferis
                                                    ;

sporis carneis." This species is readily distinguished from its congeners by the me-

tallic peridium and colom- of the spores, and from Phimrum by the spiral bands

of its threads, which appear to be four or five in number ; its spores are smooth and

subgiobose, and measure 0-0003 to 0-0004 inch in diameter; -svhere the elaters branch

ofi'a line of junction is perceptible a considerable way below the point of imion, the
Wesame spirals involving both threads.
                                        may regard" these gradations of structure

in the genera Arci/ria, Trichia, and Phr/sarum as a proof of the arbitrary nature of

generic chaiacters, and, while we are compelled to retain such divisions for our
o-mi convenience, we must regard them as merely conventional ; and, not to go

the length of some naturalists, who deny the existence of species, even in a modi-
fied sense, we are forced to acknowledge that the more each plant or animal is

studied and investigated, the more nearly do we find it connected with other

mdividuals, the transition often becoming so gradual that it is impossible to say
where one species ends and another commences.

                    The Mammalian Fauna of North-west America.
By Robert Beoavn, F.R.G.S. Sfc, Botanist to the British Columbia Expedition.

   Looking at North-west America as that portion of the country to the west of
the Kocky Mountains, north of California, an extended study of its mammalia had

led the author to divide it into several zoo-geographical regions, which may be

briefly classified as follows :

   1. The region east of the Cascade Mountains.
   2. The region west of the Cascade Mountains.

Again, the region between the Rocky Mountains and the Cascade Mountains,

i. e. east of the Cascade Mountains, is divisible into :

A(a) north-eastern district.            A(/3) south-eastern district.

In the same manner the region west of the Cascade Mountains and between

the Cascade Mountaius and the Pacific, can be classed into :

  A(a) north-western district.          A(/3) south-western district.
A3. mountain-region.
A4. Uttoral region, divided into four districts.

(a) Arctic.                             A(y) northern.
(/3) Sub-arctic.                        A(S) southern.

                                 I. Region East of the Cascade Moimtains.

   This region extends throughout the whole of North-west America, but ends
rather before the termination of forests, the Rocky Mountains, according to Mr.

W. II. DaU*, not extending straight north to the Ai-ctic Ocean, but bending

ott' to the westward, and uniting -with the Cascade range, to form the Alas-
kan Mountains of the peninsula of Aliaska. This latter range is the Northern
boundary of the true Pacific tauna, the species of animals as well as plants
found to the northward of it apparently belonging (when not members of
the Arctic fauna) to the fauna and flora of the east of the Rocky Mountains

rather to the peculiar assemblag-e of forms included in the region to the west of
that range. This region is not so wooded as the one to the west of the Cascades,

and possesses a climate cold in winter and hot in summer. North of the limit of

trees, certain piu-ely Arctic species (such as the white fox, the polar bear, and tlie

musk ox find a home. These species never come within the tree limit (which

is about Kotzebue Sound).

  --a. North-eastern Didrict. The species characteristic of it are : Vulpes macroiirus

Tar. decussatus, Ercthizon epuant/ms, Hangifer caribou, Alces Americana (rare),

Fiber ooogensis, Arctomys okana(/anus, Latjoniys minimus, and Gidus luscus. The
Columbia River may be said to be about the dividing line between it and the next,
though their zoo-geographical lines can be but vaguely drawn.

 --/3. South-eastern or Californian Distiict. The mammalian fauna here partakes

more of the Californian type*. The species characteristic are : Lutra Californica,
Lepus artetnesia, Cervus macrotus, Atitilocapra Americana, with many other species
common to it and California.

                                II. Heffion West of the Cascade Mountains.

   Most of this province is densely wooded (the northern portion more especially),
with a greater rainfall than the country to the east, the rainfall at Sitka some-
times extending to 89 inches per annum. The southern portion of the region is
more open, and a break occurring in the range, where it joins the SieiTa Nevadas,
some of the eastern species come over, but still the difference between the two

--faimas is suiHciently well-marked to be divided into :
   a. The North-ioestern District. The characteristic species are all mammals of a
wooded country, and among typically representative species comprise Sure.v Suck-
leyi, S. Trowbridc/ii, Sculops Townsendii, Lynx fasciatus, Mejihitis occidentalis, Aplo-

--dontia leporina, and various species of squirrels.
   /3. Sottth-tvestern District. Lepus Washingtonii, L. campestris, Cams latrans, &c.

                                                    III. Montane Hegion.

   After ascending to an elevation, varying according to latitude from .3000 to 5000

feet on the whole of the higher mountain-ranges throughout N.W. America,
a new group of plants and animals make their appearance. They constitute the
Alpine fauna and flora of North-west America. Though there is a slight tendency
to form a northern and a southern type of mammalian montane fauna, yet the species

are very uniform in their distribution throughout this vast region. These are :
Aplocerus montanus, Ovis montana, Lagomys princeps, Arctomys (Jlaviventer ?) and
Neosorex navigator.

                                                    IV. The Littoral Region.

  We know too little of the marine mammalian fauna of this part of the world to

make any classification more than merely tentatiie. However, the author considered

the following geographical arrangement of the fauna tolerably near the truth :

   a. The Arctic District, represented hy Bahena mysticetus, Delphinapterns Inicas, and
Trichechus rosmarus. They are almost wholly 'confined vidthin the Arctic circle,

being only stragglers outside that limit.

   /3. The Stdmrctic District is represented by the now extinct (?) Hhytina gigas,

which at one time abundantly characterized tliis district. It is, however, distin-

guished by the presence of other animals, so that the division is still retained.

y. The Northern District, represented by Callorhimis ursinus, JIalicyon Bich-

ardsi, a species of Orca, and a Phocana, closely allied to, if not identical with the
Bhoccma communis of the Atlantic.

   ^. The southern t^-pe of marine mammalian fauna may be said to commence
about the Mid Oregon coast-line. It is represented by the sea-lions of San Fran-

cisco (Otaria, sp.), Arctocephalus montericnsis, Arctocephalus {Zilophus) Gillicspii,

A. Califor7iicus, Macrorldmis angustirostris, and various species of Cetacea. The

littoral fauna, like the flora of North-west America, partakes of a Japanese type.
There are certain cosmopolitan species, e.g., within the littoral fauna, Enhydra

marina                          in the land fauna,  Vrsus horrihilis,  Cervus columbianus,  C. canmlcnsis,  Vrsui
                             ;

--americana, Procyon Hernandezii, species common to several regions while the

beaver, wolves of various species, the fisher {Mustela Pennantii), are found in all
the districts of North-west America.

   The insular faunas of North-west America are identical with those of the nearest
mainland, with the remarkable exception of the Queen Charlotte Islands, about
forty miles off the north-west coast of British Columbia. On these islands there
are no deer or wolves, and there is rumoured to be no beaver or racoon either,
though all of these animals are exceedingly abundant on the mainland.

   The prevailing habitats of the mammals of North-west America may be judged

from the following enumeration, the numbers aifecting each locality being in a
direct ratio to the order in which the habitats are mentioned.

    1. Sylvan : species affecting woods.

   2. Campestral : species affecting prairies and open ground.

   3. Periaquatic : species found in swamps, or around streams and lakes.
   4. Marine : species frequenting or living in the sea.

                                               Introduced or Extinct Species.

   1. In addition to domestic animals, Mus decKmmms and 31. musculm have esta-
blished themselves. The horse was originally obtained from the Conianches, who

stole it from the Mexicans, into whose country it was introduced by the followers

of Cortes. Among the Indians it has much degenerated, and owing to the wooded
character of the country, is not found much north of the Frazer, or to the west

of the Cascades.

   2. With the exception of the Rliytina, there is no evidence of any animal
having become extinct within historical periods, unless indeed the vague rumours
of the Mastodon having been contemporary with man be received as^such. The
buffalo {Bos americanm) has, however, been exterminated in North-west America
within the memory of this generation.

   The following is an approximate enumeration of the species found in each

order :

1. Cheiroptera, about 10 species.  5. Ruminantia, 10 species.
2. Insectivora, 6 species.
3. Carnivora, 31 species.          6. Pinnipedia, 7 species.
4. Rodentia, 47 species.

        On Chiaris alba. By Egbert 0. Cunningham, M.D., C.M.Z.S.

    After referring to the different opinions of ornithologists as to the true place of
the Sheathbill in the class to which it belongs, on account of its peculiarities of
forui and habit, the following notes on the digestive organs of a female bird
obtained in the Strait of Magellan were read :

 _ The tongue was rather thick and deeply hollowed on each side of the mesial
line. The entire length of the oesophagus (including the proventiculus) was 64

minches. It presented a well-marked enlargement, which, though not materially

differmg its structure from the rest of the tribe, may be regarded as a modified

crop. This crop was empty. The stomach, which contained small pebbles alone,
was moderately muscular, and its lining membrane was of an orange-yellow
colour. Its long diameter measured If of an inch, and its greatest fransverse
diameter i of an inch. The intestinal canal, from the pyloric orifice of the
stomach to the anus, measured a little over 40 inches. The cffica, two in number
and of equal size, were 7 inches long, and the distance between their orio-in and
the anus was 2^ inches. They considerably exceeded the diameter of the intestine
at then- extremities, and tapered to their origin in the intestine, at which point
their diameter was much less. They were filled with a pulpy yellow substance

On the Flora of the Strait of MageUan and West Coast of Patar/onia.

              By Robert 0. Ccnningham, M.D., C.M.Z.S.

The author of this paper haTino- been engaged during the years 1866-69 in

capacity of Naturalist to an expedition for surveying the Strait of Magellan and

neighbouring regions, had had many opportunities of studying the fauna and

flora of the district, and mentioned some of the principal facts regarding the

plants.

    Beginning at the eastern entrance of the Strait, and proceeding westwards to
Cape Pillar, and northwards through the long line of channels extending along
the west coast of Patagonia, between the western entrance of the Strait and the

Gulf of Penas, three regions may be recognized, the first and third of which are most

distinctly opposed to one another in their leading features; the second, or interme-

diate area, forming in some respects a connecting link between the other two.
Each of these areas possesses a certain number of species of plants and animals

peculiar to itself, as well as a certain number common to its neighbours.

The first region is limited to the north-eastern part of the Strait of Magellan,

extending from the eastern entrance to Cape Negro on the Patagonian, and rather

further in a south-westerly direction on the Fuegian coasts. It consists of a vast

tract of low-lying undulating plains, with here and there a range of low saddle-

backed hills                                                 and boulder-clay is the principal geological formation.                                                         It is entirely
                                                          ;

destitute of trees, and almost so of shrubs, covered with yellow grass, dry and

arid in its nature, abounding in small lakes and ponds of salt water, and only here

and there presenting a green oasis where a small stream finds its way into the
waters of the Strait. It may be considered as a continuation of that vast tract of
Pampas which extends throughout Patagonia and the Argentine Republic as far

north as the extreme of the Plate. Over these plains the Guanaco, Puma, and

Hhea, hunted by the far-famed Patagonians, roam. The atmosphere is dry and

clear, and the climate a delightful and exhilarating one.

The third region is very different in all re.spect8, being foi-med of very rugged

mountainous country, densely covered with impenetrable evergreen woods, with

intervals of bare boggy land. It may be defined as reaching from Port Famine to

the western entrance to the Strait, and northwards through the channels to the
Gulf of Peiias. The climate is one of the most humid in the world, the atmo-

sphere being hardly ever free from mist, and heavy rain falling almost every day
throughout the year, fi'equently for many days and nights together. Magnificent

glaciers occur abundantly, and innumerable streams flow down the mountain sides

in most places, so polishing the rugged faces of the hills as to render their ascent

difficult, if not impossible, and feeding long chains of lakes and tarns which occupy

the narrow and winding valleys. Deer are occasionally to be met with in the

woods, and otter, seal, and poi-poises in the water of the channels ; but there is a
great paucity of animal life in this district.

The second region intermediate in position between the other two, and also as

regards its character, extends fi-om the beginning of the wooded country at Cape

Negro as far as Port Famine. Its mountains are not so steep, and its forests not so

impenetrable as those                                        of the third  or western region                                                                                 and it presents considerable

tracts of land available for pasture. The prevailing tree in the woods is the de-

ciduous or antarctic beech, which imparts a well-marked aspect to the landscape.
Though there is a considerable rainfall, the climate cannot be considered as a wet
one, and there is much fine bright weather, though the sun has no great strength. It

is in this district that the Chilian colony of Punta Arenas (Sandy Point) is situated,
and there cattle thri^-e in the open air, and various green crops come to maturity.

Parraquets, Woodpeckers, and a variety of small birds, inhabit the woods; aiid

geese, snipe, and an Ibis frequent the open tracts of ground.
   The distribution of the various orders, genera, and species of plants throughout

these three regions was then considered somewhat in detail, and the existence of a

considerable number of species not previously recorded as inhabitants of them was

noted. Among the additions to the fiora of the first region, Adesmia huronioides,

Arabis Muclovann, Botnjchium lunaria, Crantzia lineatn, jkippiiris vulgaris, and
Oenothera were specified. Instances of plants apparently peculiar to the second

tioned; wbile 3Ietro.sideras stipularis, Mitruria coccinea, Lomutia ferruginea, a
 Weinmanm'a, a Panaa, Campsiduan gracile, HymenophiiHum cruenfum, and H. pec-
tinattim, were enumerated as among the more remarkable additions to the flora

of the third region.

   From an examination of the Phanerogamia and Crvptogamia occurring to the
north and south of the Gulf of Peiias, it was concluded that many more species
were common to these regions than was at one time supposed, and that no very
marked alteration in the flora of the south-western coast of South America was

apparent between the Strait of Magellan and ^"aldinia.

                 Microscopical Observations at Miinster am Stein.
                      By George Gladstone, F.R.G.S., F.C.S.

    This communication contained a list of the principal freshwater animalculee
which the author had found within the week ending August 14 in the River Nahe

among the water-plants which border the river. It was verj' rich in the hio-her

forms of Rotatoria, including even that rare and beautiful creature the Stephano-
ceros. Flosadaria ornata and proboscidcs were very common, as were also the
Limnia. 3Ii'licerta rinf/ens and Lacinularia sociaUs were not rare. Potifer vidgaris,
Salpina, Hydutina, Ptcrodina patina, Chafonotm, and other forms of free swimmino-
Rotifera were particularly abundant. Of the Infusoria, the Vorticellina were well

represented both in respect of number, variety, and size, many of the VorticellcB
and Epistylis being unusually large. Vaginicoke also occurred. The lower orders
included, amongst others, Chihdon, Amphilepfiis, and Amoeba 2>rinceps. Of Cypri-

dina there were Daphnia, Cgpris, and Cgclops. Diatomacere and Desmideje were
very abundant, the former class comprising Diatom vidgare, Fragillaria, Bacillaria,
Navicida, Cocconcmn, and Gomphonema ; the latter, Closterium, Pediastrum,
Micrasterias. Arthrodesmus, and Euastrum.

   The mineral water, or rather the brine, after having passed through the Gradir-
salinen, was also subjected to microscopic examination. Not much was expected,
as the water is highly saline, though the tanks contain millions of larvae. The only
other living creatures consisted of a very active kind of worm, some round and

oval monads, Actinophrgs, and Amaha princcps. The tanks were full of Diato-

macefe, principally Fragillaria. The brine (which is used in Miinster and Kreuz-
nach for bathing) is of the specific gravity of about ITl, and contains about 1'2 per

cent, of chloride of sodium, 2 percent, of chloride of calcium, besides lesser propor-

tions of the chlorides of magnesium and potassium, and of the bromide of sodium.

On tilt Law of the Development of Cereals. By F. F. Hallett, F.L.S.

From his investigations the author had arrived at the following conclusions :

That where room has been aflbrded to the plant for its natural development

1. Every fully developed plant, whether of wheat, oats, or barley, presents an

ear superior in productive power to any of the rest on that plant.

2. Every such plant contains one grain which, upon trial, proves more produc-

tive than any other.

3. The best grain in a given plant is found in its best ear.

4. The superior vigour of this grain is transmissible in different degrees to its

progeny.

5. By repeated careful selection the superiority is accumulated.

6. The improvement whicli is at first rapid, gradually, after a long series of

years, is diminished in amount, and eventually so far arrested that, practically

speaking, a limit to improvement in the desired quality is reached.

   7. By still continuing to select, the improvement is maintained and practically

a fixed tj'pe is the result.

The accumulation of improvement obtainable on the principles set forth in the

paper was very fully illustrated by specimens.

114 REPORT 1869.

  On some curious Fossil Fungi fro^n the Black Shale of the Northumherland
       Coal-field*. By Albani Hancock, F.L.S., and Thomas Atthet.

   In this paper the authors described some small lenticular bodies found in the
black shale at Cramlington, Newsham, and in other localities in the district ; and
from the internal structure, which is well preserved, they conclude that these
bodies are Funf^i, related to the curious Indian form Sclerotium siipitahim, of
Berkeley and Currey. This relationship is likewise shown by the general form
and surface-characters.

   Five species were described under the following' names : Archagaricon bvlhosum,
A. glohuliferum, A. radiatuni) A. dendriticum, A. conglomeratum.

On the Occurrence of Rapistrum rugosum, All., in Surrey, Kent, and Somer-

                          setshire. By W. P. HiBEN, M.A.

   This plant the author first noticed on the 24:th of June, 1800, in Surrey, near the

river Thames, below Barnes. On the 8tli of Jul}' he also met with it in tlie Isle of

Thauet, gro'wing in corn-fields, in company with Siiiajiis arvcnsis, L., and other
common weeds. Again, in a letter to Mr. Berkeley, dated the 18th July, Mr.
Broome wi'ites from Batheaston, in Somersetshire, " Hajnstrum rugosmn, Koch,
turned iip here the other day in some abundance in one place, and I have since

seen it in my own meadows."

   On examining the plant, the cruciform flowers, with teti-adynamous stamens,
refer it to the natural order Cruciferte. Then the transversely 2-jointed fruit, with
the upper joint indehiscent, brings the genus into the tribe Cakilinese, which

limits the plant to about 40 out of the 1200 species or more that are contained in
Cruciferse. Further, the indehiscent and not verj- small lower joint of the fruit,

the conduplicate cotyledons, and the yellow flowers, bring the plant into the genus
Hapistruin, Desv. The nearest allied British genus is Cramhe.

   The upper joint of the fruit of this plant is hairy, globular, and without two horns

at the top, and is provided with meridional ribs like those of a mellon, except that
they are interrupted and rugose and the lower joint is oblong, in the form of an

                                                                                                                                                                             ;

inflated pedicel, unlike the upper joint, and nearly as long as the fruit-pedicel.
These characters refer the plant to the species R. rugosum, All., H. hirsutunt,
Host. Mapisfrxm contains eight weU-defiued species, all of which occur in the
countries on the shores of the Mediterranean sea ; most of them occur in Algiers, and
several in the Mediten-anean islands. H. rugosum has the widest distribution of all.

The author has seen specimens in the Kew herbarium from Constantinople, Syria,

Austria, Switzerland, and Algiers, from several places in Germany and France, and
from the islands of Sicily, Corsica, Tenerifie, Madeira, Canaries, and Azores.

On iJie Relative Value of the Characters employed in the Classification of

               Plants. By Dr. Maxwell T. Masters, F.L.S.

This paper was devoted to the consideration of some of the means employed by

botanists in elaborating the "natural" sy.stems of classification, and to the estima-

tion of the relative value to be attached to those means. The characters treated of

--were the following: 1. Characters derived. from the relative frequency of occur-

rence of a particular form, or a particular arrangement of organs ; 2, developmental

characters, wliether  " congenital "  or  " acquired "                                        3, teratological characters
                                                                                           ;

4, rudimentaiy characters ; 5, special physiological characters ; 6, characters de-

pendent on geographical distribution.

To arrive at an estimate of the first class of characters, the plan followed in the

paper was to enumerate, in the case of any particular " cohort " or " alliance," all

the main points which had been employed by various authors to characterize the

group in question, or to distinguish it from its allies, and to arrange them according

to tlie frequency of their occurrence in the several families, placing those characters

first which occurred most frequently, and afterwards, in order, those that occurred

less often. It this way it was shown that those characters which are most im-

portant, from tlieir frequency of occurrence and invariability, are those that are
congenital in their origin, while those that are least often met with are " acquired,"
i. e. later in their development. While the former are " general " in a physiolo-

gical sense, the latter are special and peculiar to the smaller groups, perhaps to
one family only. Further illustrations were given in explanation of these and
other characters, for the purpose of showing their applicability to particular cases.

In estimating the value to be attached to certain characters, it is necessary to con-

sider the purpose for which they are required. If the object be synthetical, if we

are seeking points of resemblance, so as to be enabled to gTOup together a large

number of forms into one or more large aggregates, stress must be laid, in the first
instance, on the congenital characters, as serving to bind together the greatest
numbers ; then on those dependent on frequency of occuiTence and special physio-
logical office, afterwards on such others as may be forthcoming. If the object be
analytical and discriminative, the special physiological characters demand the first
attention, then those which have the merit of frequency and invariability, and then
those that are congenital. The systematist can very rarely act up to his own
standard. Individual cases have to be treated on their own merits, philosophy has

to be sacrificed to expediency, but the tact and insight of a first-class naturalist
often lead him to make combinations, or to allocate forms, on what seem mere

grounds of expedience, but which afterwards prove, when :Oiller evidence is gained,

to be strictly consistent with philosophical views.

   The Eev. A. M. Normai^ made some remarks in introducing to the notice of the
Section the following important letter from Prof. WyviUe Thomson :

                                                                                                  " Belfast, Aug. 7, 1869.

My --" deae Noeman, You are already aware that, during the first cruise of

this year, Mr. Jeffreys and his party dredged and took most important thermome-

tricai and other observations to a Septli of 1470 fathoms. When I took Mr. Jef-

freys"s place for the second cruise, it was the intention to proceed northwards, and

to work up a part of the north-west passage, north of Rockall. I found, however, on

joining the \essel, the gear in such perfect order, all the arrangements so excellent,

the weather so promising, and the confidence of our excellent commander so high,

that, after consulting with Captain Calver, I suggested to the hydrographer that

we should turn southwards, and explore the very deep water off the Bay of

Biscay. I was anxious that, if possible, the gi-eat questions of the distribution of

temperature &c., and of the conditions suitable to the existence of animal life,

should be finally settled ; and the circumstances seemed singularly favourable. No

thoroughly reliable soundings have been taken beyond 2800 fathoms, and I felt

that if we could approach 2500, all the gi'and problems would be virtually solved,

and the investigation of any greater depths would be a mere matter of detail and

curiosity.  The  Hydrographer  at  once  consented  to  this  change  of plan                                         and  on  the
                                                                                                                   ;

17th of July we left Belfast and steered round to Cork, where we coaled, and then

stood out towards some soundings, about a couple of hundred miles south-west of

Ushant, marked on the Admiralty charts 20C0 fathoms and upwards. On the

20th and 21st we took a few hauls' of the dredge on the slope of the great plateau,

in the mouth of the Channel, in depths from 75 to 725 fathoms, and on the 22nd

we sounded with the ' Hydra ' sounding-apparatus, the depth 2435 fathoms, with a

bottom of fine Atlantic chalk-mud, and a temperature registered by two standard

AMiller-Six's thermometers of 36°-5 Fahrenheit.         heavy dredge was put over in
the afternoon, and slowly the gieat coils of rope melted from the ' Aunt-Sallies '--

as we call a long line of iron bars, with round wooden heads, on which the coils

are hung. In about an hour the dredge reached the bottom, upwards of three

miles off. The dredge remained down about three hours, the Captain moving the

ship slowly up to it from time to time, and anxiously watching the pulsations of

the accumulator, ready to meet and ease any undue strain. At nine o'clock p.m.

the drums of the donkey-engine began to turn, and gi'adually and steadily the

' Aunt-Sallies ' filled up again, at the average rate of about 2 feet of rope per second.

A few minutes before one o'clock in the morning 2 cwt. of iron (the weights fixed

500 fathoms from the dredge) came up, and at one o'clock preciselv a cheer from
                                                                                                     8*

a breathless little band of ^Yatcllels intimated that the dredge had returned in

slight accident had occurred. In going down the rope had taken a loop round the

dredge-bag, so that the bag was not full. It contained, however, enough for our

--purpose 1^ cwt. of "Atlantic ooze; " and so the feat was accomplished. Some

of us tossed ourselves down on the sofas, without taking off our clothes, to wait till
daylidit to see wliat was in the dredge. The next day we dredged again in 2090

--fathoms, practically the same depth, and brought up '2 cwt. of ooze the bottom

temperature being'36°-4 ; and we spent the rest of the day in making what will, I

am sure, prove a most valuable series of temperature observations at e^'ery 250

fathom-point from the bottom to the surface. These enormously deep dredgings

could not be continued. Each operation required too much time, and the strain

was too great, both upon the tackle and upon the nervous systems of all concerned,

especially of Captain Calver and his officers, who certainly did aU that could be

Wehome, dredging in easier depths.  start again to-morrow, and, as you may

suppose, I have enough to do. I can therefore only gi\'e you the slightest pos-

sible sketch of our results, anticipating fuller information when I have time to

collate the diaries and to look over the specimens. First, as to the temperature.

The superheating of the sun extends only to the depth of about 50 fathoms.

Another cause of superheating, probably the Gulf-stream, extends to the depth of

from 500 to 700 fathoms. After that the temperature gradually sinks at the rate

of about 0°-2 for every 200 fathoms. This is probably the normal rate of decrease,

--any deviation being produced by some special cause a warm or a cold current.

Secondly, the aeration of the water. Mr. Hunter, who accompanied me as phy-

sicist, found the water from great depths to contain a large excess of carbonic acid,

and he found the water from ail depths to contain a considerable proportion of

dissolved organic matter ; thus in e-\ery way bearing out the observations of Mr.
W. L. Carpenter during the first cruise. Thirdly, distribution of life. Life ex-

tends to the fp-cntest depths, and is represented by all the marine invertebrate

groups. At 24;^5 fathoms we got a handsome Dcntalimn, one or two crustaceans,

several Annelids and Gephi/iva, a very remarkable new Crinoid with a stem 4iuche.s

long (I am not prepared to say whether a mature form or a Pentacrinoid), several

starfishes, two hydroid zoophytes, and many Foraminifera. Still the fiiuna has

a dtvarfed and arctic look. This is, doubtless, from the cold. At 800 to UOO

fathoms, temperature 40^ Fahr. and upwards, the fauna is rich, and is especially

characterized by the great abundance of vitreous sponges, which seem to be nearly

related to, if not identical with, the Ventriculites of the (^'halk. This year's work

has produced many forms new to science and many new to the British fauna.

Among the most remarkable in the groups I have been working at I may mention

a very singular Echinoderm, representing a totally new (/roup of the subkingdom,

a splendid new Ophiurid, many specimens of Sars's Bhizocrinns Lofotcnsis, many

vitreous sponges, including species of AphrocaUistes, Iloltema, and Hyalonemo

a fine Solarium from the coast of Kerry, and many other tilings. As I am only

writing in the interval of scaling the boiler, Avith no opportunity of going over

the collections, you must accept this sketch. 1 trust to your contributing the

On a Hijbrid or other variety of Perclix cinerea found in Devonshire.
                             By i)r. W. K. Scoxt.

The author stated that in the year 1859-(j0 there appeared in the western part

of Devonshire a covey of partridges, differing considerably in colour from the

common species, Perdix cinerea, many of which were obtained and preserved. In

1861-62 a covey of twelve of these birds were observed, differing only from those

first seen by some of them having white feathers on their breasts. In 1862-6.3

birds of the same description were obtained, so that from the year 1859 to 1863

these birds appeared in this district. The plumage of these birds differed from

that of the ordinary species by being of a darker and richer brown uniformly spread

over the whole body, in having no grey markings, and in the entire absence of the

horseshoe on the breast. They had also a black patch on each cheek, extending

backwards, with a tendency to form a gorget across the throat. The question was

then, What were these birds ? were they sports from the ordinary colour of

P. cinerea, or were they hybrids ?  In  either  case  they were  remarkable                                                        for if
                                                                                                                                ;

considered as the former, then it was certainly unusual to find a whole brood de-

parting at once from the characters of the parents even in colour, while if they

were hybrids, they were equally exceptional, as there was no case on record that

he was aware of where P. cinerea and P. rufa had paired. For some time this last

supposition was inadmissible, since P. rrifa was not found in the west of England

but on stricter inquiry, it was ascertained that some had been introduced not far

from the district where the birds under consideration were found, and that one of

these had associated itself with a covey of the P. cinerea. In the eastern counties,

where both species are plentiful, no hybridity has ever taken place, and it is stated

that P. rufa drives the common bird away. But where both birds were numerous
and had a sufficient choice amongst those of their own species, remoter alliances

were not so likely to occur as when a single individual or so of one species only

existed, and was living with a covey of the others. In either case, however,

whether they were hybrids or mere varieties, the author considered them remark-

able and deservin": of record.

   Nicaragua was stated to present two distinct types of soil, vegetation, and cli-
mate, and the terrestrial mollusca were found to be restricted to some extent to
one or the other of the districts. Of the 55 species of laud and freshwater shells
catalogued bj^ the author, the following are new to science : Tvhennophurus auratus,
Limax meridionalis, Helix ccecoicles, II. Blakeann, Tornatellina interstriata, T.
hyalina, Planorlns declivis, Unio Tatei. The moUuscan fiiuna of Nicaragua presents
no marked fades, and is characterized by the absence of, rather than by the pre-
sence of peculiar genera. The geographical position of Nicaragua would lead us
to infer that its species would be in common with those of the Mexican province
on the one hand, and with those of the Columbian province on the other. This is
the case; thus Butimus Berendti, B. uniculor, B. maculatus, B. mimosarum, Ileli.v

Five Years^ Experience in Artificial Fish-hreedinri , showing in what waters
    Trout will and will not thrive, with some Remarhs on Fish and British

    Fisheries. B>/ W. F. Webb, F.E.G.S.
   This paper gives the result of many experiments conducted by the author at

Newstead Abbey, both in lakes and streams, by which it is evident that tempera-
ture is the main point to study. Trout will thrive well in waters the midsummer
temperature of which does not exceed 62°, but when it attains 70° and upwards
they sicken and die off, even in swift-running streams. The author demonstrates,
by numerous examples, that both trout and all the Salmonidfe inhabit and thrive
best in waters of low temperature in every part that they are indigenous to. The

paper strongly advises the introduction of tlie Indian ilahseer into the fresh waters
of Great Britain, as the author states, from personal experience, that it is a fish
attaining very great weight, excellent for the table, giving sport to the angler,

and from not being migi'ator3' in its habits, exempt from the destruction caused by
sewage at the mouths of many rivers. The paper concludes by pointing out the
great devastation caused by trawl-nets throughout the narrow Lochs of the Western
Highlands, and to the rapid decrease of small fry of all sorts of fish already from
this cause, which calls for the immediate attention of the Legislature.

               Human Vaccine Lymi^h and Heifer Lymph compared.
By Henrt Blanc, M.D., F.R.G.S., Staff Assistant- Surgeon, Bombay Army.

    Compvdsory vaccination is a wise and proper measure, but this must be subordi-
nate to one essential condition, namely, that the vaccine lymph forced upon the
public shall be as pure and as perfect as we can obtain it. The present human
lymph does not possess these characters. This leads us to examine the two fol-
lowing important questions :

    1. Can other than vaccine disease be transmitted by humanized vaccine lymph ?
    2. Is humanized lymph of long standing a trustworthy prophylactic against

 smallpox ?

    If we can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the transmission of disease has
 taken place, even if only in a few instances, these instances should render us less
 positive in our denials when in presence of very strong probabilities only.

    Science acknowledges two orders of disease that have been transmitted by human

--vaccine Ij'mph certain affections of the skin, and syphilis.

    On the 3rd of August, Dr. Uepaul, the Director of Vaccination in France, in
 concluding, at the Academy of Sledicine of Paiis, a very remarkable speech on
----

this question remarked, " Within a very short time more than forty cases of \-ac-

cinal syphilis have been observed and accepted as open to no doubt by many

scientific men. All the theories, all the false interpretations, all the subtleties of

those who, ag-aiust evidence, persist in their denial, cannot in any way weaken

these facts. Syphilis introduced i)ito the system by vaccination is no myth, it is a
sad and terrible reality.''

   As we cannot deny the existence of the transmission of disease, the public

should be supplied, in presence of compidsory vaccination, " with an uncontami-

nated vaccine lymph.''

Is humanized lymph of long standing a trustworthy prophylactic against small-

pox ? It is not. The present vaccine lymph is degenerated, and has lost much

of its antivariolic power.

If we begin with Jenner, we find that at that date direct inociUation from the

cow, in other words, " animal vaccination," is a most perfect and lasting protection

Aagainst smallpox.  few cases of post-vaccinal smallpox were noticed as soon as

natural animal vaccination was superseded by the use of humanized lymph. This

percentage gradually increased. In the London Smallpox Hospital from 1835

to 1845, the admission of patients attacked with smallpox, after vaccination, was

already 44 per cent. ; from 1845 to 1855 it rose to 64 per cent. ; fi-om 1855 to

18G5 to 78 per cent. ; and during the two years 1863 and 1864, it was as high as

eiyhty-three and eighty-four per cent, respectively.

The deaths from smallpox after vaccination have also gi'adually increased, from

none in 1800 they rose above nine per cent, in 1863; so that if we consider the in-

creased resusceptibility to smallpox, and the increased fatality amongst the vacci-

nated, we arrive at very discouraging results ; for example, during the ten j'ears

from 1855 to 1865, the mortality in the London Smallpox Hospital gives for the

unvaccinated only GO more than for the vaccinated ! the number being for the

vaccinated 450, for the unvaccinated 528 ! What does this teach us ? To foUow

the example of those who first practised animal vaccination ; do as the milkers of

cows did, and seek for a perfect protection in a return to the prophjdactic in all

its purity.

Animal vaccination offers the following advantages :

   1. The liealthy heifer, inoculated with pure spontaneous cowpox, supplies a
vaccine lymph free from all morbid and diathetic principles.

2. Spontaneous cowpox, by being transmitted only through the bovine race,

retains all its essential qualities.

3. Vaccination direct from the heifer offers all the characteristics of the cowpox,

as described hj Jenner, Ceely, &c., with such modifications only as are due to the

passage of the lymph through young and healthy animals.

  4. By animal vaccination we have always on hand an unlimited supply of good

vaccine lymph.

 Voltaic Electricity in relation to Physiology.* By W. Kencely Beidgman.

   At the Meeting held in Norwich in 1868, the author read a paper on " Electro-
lysis in the Mouth," having reference to an occurrence of a very singular character.

A ligature of silk -twist had been applied to some front teeth on account of their

malposition, and, when removed, it was foimd to have become encrusted with a
crystalline deposit, obtained from the enamel, the surface of which presented a

deep groove along the entire course of the ligature.

   To identify this proceeding as one of electrolytic transfer, it was sought to
obtain a parallel effect with the metals, and which, according to the author's ex-
periments, was successfully accomplished, clearly establishing their unity of origin.

                  On the Interpretation of the Limbs and Lower Jaw.

                              By Professor Cleland, M.D.

   In this commimication the following propositions were laid down and illus-

trated :

   * Published in externa in the ' British Journal of Dental Science ' for JNovember I8G9.
120 REPORT--1869.

   1. The various systems of tlie body are, in at least all the more symmetrical
animal forms, arranged in more or less perfect circles round the digestive tube.

   2. The visceral or costal arches of the vertebrate skeleton constitute, when fully

developed, circles external to those of the vascular system, and internal to the
primary stratum of the muscular system, and each visceral arch is a part of a
single segment of the body.

   .3. The limbs consist each of a girdle or limb-arch, and a radiation or appendage.
   That the limb-arch is not a radiation is sufficiently evident from its circling
always more or less round the body, and being sometimes complete above, some-

time complete below.
    4. Neither the limb-arch nor its appendage is the property of one particular seg-

ment. They receive nerves from various segments, not a very definite number,
and are very variable in position, especially the hind limb.

    5. Probably the typical position of the limb-girdle is superficial to the primary
muscular layer, as in the pectoral girdle of most animals, but it varies in position, and

this is explained by the development. The appendage is developed before the limb-
arch, and is an extension outwards of the ventral plate, while as yet that plate may
be considered as forming the periphery of the embryo ; and the arch is developed in

connexion with the appendage, while as yet the dorsal plates extend little outwards.
   6. The suspensorium and lower jaw form an arch corresponding with the limb-

arches and the opercular apparatus of fishes consists of appendages attached to it.
                                       ;
   In proof of this it may be mentioned that,
       a. The jaw is external to the visceral arc^hes of the skull.
       b. The jaw is composed of parts more complex than a visceral arch.
       c. The suspensorium, quadrate bone, or incus, is usually connected with at
          least two segments of the skull.
   7. The difficulty of distinguishing the jaw as a limb-arch arises from the thin-

ness of the visceral walls in the cephalic and cervical regions. Hence the intimate
connexion between jaw and hyoid arch in fishes, and the connexion of the hyoid
bone in turn with the branchial arches, which are splanchnic.

   8. The three limb-arches may be considered as corresponding with the three

greatregionsof the body, viz. the cephalic, the cervico-thoracic, and the abdomino-
pelvic regions, which are respectively the seats of greatest development of the
animal, vascular, and vegetative systems.

   The crowding forwards of the limbs in many osseous fishes is in harmony with

the whole piscine structure, the great regions in fishes being comparatively undif-
ferentiated and crowded under the head, while the mass of the animal is a mere tail.

             The Human Mesocolon iUustrated hy that of the Womhat.
                              By Professor Cleland, M.D.

The general an-angement of the small and gi'eat intestines in the Wombat is

very similar to what is found in the human subject, although they are of greater

proportional length. The paper pointed out that the arrangement of the perito-

neum in the Wombat exactly corresponded with the conditions which the writer

described in the ' Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,' May 18G8, as existing in

the human fcetus of three months. The descending, and half of the transverse

colon are provided, as in the human foetus, with a mesocolon springing from near

the  middle  line                      and  the  right  half of the  transverse  colon,  having  crossed  the
                                    ;

third part of the duodenum, is bound to the commencement of that part of the

intestine, near the pylorus, by a narrow fold of peritoneum, immediately above the

upper end of the mesocolon just mentioned. That narrow peritoneal fold marks

the neck of the primary loop of the intestine which formerly extended out at the

umbilicus, and the crossing of the duodenum by the colon is efiected by the twist

which tlie loop takes to the right. The mesocolon has no connexion \\-ith the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I

                          By John C. Galton, M.A., F.L.S*

   That wliich Brants (Dissert. Zool. Inaiig. de Tardigi-adis, p. 27 : Lugdun. Batav.
1828) has remarked relative to the muscles of the limbs of the Sloths appears to
be fairly applicable to the Two-toed Anteater, namely, " Vires motrices anticse

--corporis partis esse, posticam vero validis musculis ad anteriorem attrahi atque

hujus motus sequi debere," and the more so when we contrast the short hiimeru,<(,

rugged with strong muscular ridges, with the long smooth femur, which lacks
even a rudiment of a third trochanter.

   In addition to a long prehensile tail (at best but a stunted member in the

Sloths), naked for the lower third of its length, the fore and hind feet are marvel-
lously modified for arboreal progression, the functional absence of the pollex being
compensated for, as Meckel hints, by the enormous development of the pisiform
bone, to which are attached numerous strong muscles, while a long strigil-shaped
bone, passing baclrward from the scaphoid, more than makes up for the compara-
tive shortness of the calcaneal process.

  --After the consideration in detail of the muscular system in this and other Eden-

tates, the question naturally arises What zoological value do such details possess?

None, it must be confessed. For, apart from their bearings upon the question of
the serial and general homologies of muscles, they do not enable us in anywise to
simplify and improve the classification, as yet very unsatisfactory, of the members
of this much-varying order.

           On the Homologies in the Extremities of the Horse.
                     By E. Gaknek, F.E.C.S., F.L.S.

The author expressed a doubt whether the cannon-bone in the horse is the

metacarpal or metatarsal of the third finger or toe (as the case may be) soleli/ ;

and his doubts were derived from comparing the so-called monodactyle animal

with  the  fossil  horse,  and  also  with  the ox                                  from the articulation of the cannon-
                                                                                 ;

bone of the horse with two bones of the tarsus (confining himself to the hind

limb), the external cuneiform and the cuboid, and from one or two other conside-

rations, perhaps of less weight. He questions whether the horse is not monodac-

tyle by coalescence, with a trace of the fourth metacarpal or metatarsal ; and again,

whether in the ox there is not a trace of the first metatarsal in that part of" the

cannon-bone articulating above with the little bone which is probably the first or

inner cuneiform. He is hardly satisfied with the usual rendering of the subject in

the above and other points, as, for instance, the supposed want of homology between

the side hoofs in the hipparion and the little posterior hoofs of the ruminants.

   It does not appear that any use can be attributed to the little horny bodies

called chcifaif/nes, which we see in the fore and hind legs of the horse ; they have
a musky odour when shaved or cut, and hence they might be supposed to be

scent-organs, which, however, is unlikely. They are not merely epidermic, but

connected with the cutis vera like nails and hoofs. There are traces of the same

parts in all other equine animals, and also of another little horny body called the

e7-ffot, or spur, situated at the fetlock, behind the union of the cannon-bone with

the pastern. These cannot be reduced to the same category as the callosities

or mere epidermal hardnesses, placed where they are of use as protective shields in
certain animals, as on the legs and sternum of the camel. The chataig-nes appear

to the author to be the vestiges of the nails of the missing great toe and thumb

the ergots of the nails of the two minor toes of the fossil horse. In such aberra-
tions, as deficient or supernumerary fingers or toes, it is not rare to find a nail to
exist where the phalanges have disappeared, and in some individuals a whole row

of phalanges has disappeared, whilst all the nails remain normal. The situation

of the bodies in question agrees sufficiently with the theory broached.

122 REPORT--1869.

On the Solvent Treatment of Uric-Acid Calculus, and the Quantitative Determi-

 nation of Uric Acid in Urine. By the Rev. W. V. Haecoukt, F.R.S., Sfc.

The author of this paper having been apprized of the presence of a calculus in

the bladder of considerable size*, and consisting in all probability of uric acid, re-

solved upon giving a trial to the solvent alkaline treatment as proposed by l)r.

Roberts, Physician to the Manchester Roj'al Intirmary, of which the lirst notice

will be found in the Eeport of the British Association for 1861, and of which he

has given a full account in his ' Treatise on Urinary and Uenal Diseases.'

In one of the leading experiments made by Dr. Roberts, he passed the urine of

a patient who was taking citrate of potash at the rate of 40 grains in 5 ounces of

water every two hours, over a fragment of uric calculus, and by this process re-

duced it in twelve hours from 180-5 to 174 grains, or at the rate, in twenty- four hours,

of 13 grains. If the action within the bladder resembles that without it, though

the action on an entire calcidus could not be expected to equal that on a fragmen-

tary piece, yet there was reason to expect a difterence between the quantity of

uric acid normally excreted and the excretions under the effect of the alkaline

treatment, determinable by chemical analysis. With this view the author insti-

tuted a series of experiments in his own laboratory, which, though they did not

fully realize his expectations, throw some light on this important subject. The

method first employed of precipitating the uric acid was that in ordinary use by

hydrochloric acid. The first seven determinations, from the 20t]i of August,

1868, to the 26th inclusive, were made each day on the urine of the preceding

twenty-four hours, in a neutral or slightly alkaline state, brought to that state by

doses of from 120 to 105 grains of citrate of potash. The quantities of uric acid

obtained varied from ll'08to 8'43 grains. In the subsequent daily determinations,

down to the 5th of September, acid reactions were interpolated, due to the use of

smaller alkaline doses, which lowered proportionably the amount of uric acid ob-

tained                                  and when  no  alkali  had  been  taken for two daj^s, and  the urine was in
                                     ;

consequence strongly acid, the quantity of uric acid found was only 2-35 grains.

From this time commenced a course of large quantities of citrate of potash,

amounting, during fourteen days, to 315 grains in twenty-four hours, taken in a

state of eft'ervescence, in do!;es of 45 grains, dissolved in 3 fluid-ounces of waterf

For ten of these days hydrochloric acid was used to precipitate the lu'ic acid

and the determination of this gave from 11 -90 to 6-00 grains. The preference,

however, assigned by Dr. Thudichum, in his able and well-known treatise on the

'Pathology of the Urine,' to nitric over hytirochloric acid, as having given him

better results, led the author subsequently to employ his method. Tlie quan-

tity of citrate of potash taken in twenty-four hours was then raised to 350 grains

for four consecutive days. On the first of tliese days the uric acid found was 1'54

grain, on the second 1'23 grain. These results were so extraordinary that, for

the purpose of corroborating them, or disco^·ering any error. Dr. Thudichum was

requested to imdertake an analysis of a portion of the urine of tlie latter day. Ac-

cording to his analysis the uric acid amounted to no more than 0'775 grain.

This result led to one of two conclusions; either independently of any question

of the solution of the calculus the presence of the lu-ic acid in the bladder had

been almost entirely prevented by the alkaline treatment, or the process for ob-

taining it was altogether unreliable. The latter alternative appearing the most

probable, more attention was given to the method of determination. One half of

a urine which had yielded 8-42 grains with hydrochloric acid, was treated with

}r> per cent, nitric acid and kept at the temperature of 90° F., the alkalinity and

dilution ha^^ng been brought to a standard corresponding with the urine analyzed

by Dr. Thudichum. The uric acid thus obtained weighed 2-07 grains, showing a

loss by this method of 6-35 grains. The alkalinity was now determined for every

   * The size of the calculus, as determined by Mr. Spencer Wells, and confirmed by Sir
H. Thompson, was 1-5 inch in one of its diameters.

   t The tides of acidity and alkalinity in urine, consequent on digestion, which occur at
different periods of the day and night, deserve attention in the distribution of alkaline
doses, especially when the quantity taken is small enough to leave an aj)prehension of

uric acid being deposited in the bladder.

careful, the portions of urine operated upon were entirely filtered, and the water

with which the precipitates were washed was acidified with acetic acid. The

secretion of mucus being now a good deal in excess, the quantitj* of alkali taken

--was reduced ^for five days to 300 grains of the citrate in twenty-four hours, for

eight days to quantities varying from 270 to 240 grains, and for thirty-five days

more (wdth the exception of three days, on account of diarrhoea and bleeding)

to quantities varying from 285 to 120 grains. The details of these experiments

were given in the paper * ; but it may be enough to mention here that no propor-

tion could be observed between the determinations of alkalinity and those of the

accompanying uric acid. Twenty days, in which the alkalinity of twenty-four

hours varied from 19-2 to 40'3, gave an average of uric acid 7'94 grains ; whilst

--fiifteen days, when the alkalinity was from 191 down to 1'4, gave an average of

uric acid 8-08 grains a fact which would have shown that the alkali had exercised

no action on the calculus, in case the determinations of the uric acid could be

depended upon, and in case the alkaline treatment did not cause a diminution of

the uric acid secreted. The latter point coidd only be ascertained by a course of

experiments in cases free from calculus ; the former point the author proceeded

to investigate. He found that the quantity of uric acid precipitated from the

urine was diminished by dilution, and augmented by concentration pre\ious to the

addition of tJie hydi-ochloric acid. In forty comparative experiments, the two

extremes of excess in the concentrated over the natural urine were 1-08 and

4-13 grains, in the last fifteen of which the urine was reduced to a standard volume

of 6 or 3 fluid-ounces, according as half or quarter of the urine was employed ; the

average difference was 3-03; in the former twenty-five, reduced to the above pro-

portions, the average excess in the weight of the precipitates was 309 grains. The

determinations were further improved by the adoption of the following method :

a  fourth of the                            m-ine of twenty-four  hours  was  evaporated to                                      3 fluid-ounces                                                        it
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

was treated with a mixture of hydrochloric acid and alcohol in equal parts, each

being 2"o per cent,                         of the  quautitj' of urine  emploj'ed                                                the precipitate was washed
                                                                                                                              ;

with alcohol (methylated spirit), and then with equal parts of acetic acid and

water. The colouring-matter and phosphates &c. were thus removed, and the

lU'ic acid was of a light colour and completeh', though confvisedly, crystalline.

   The advantage which this method possesses over those heretofore in use is shown

--in the experiment which foUows : In urine having an acidity of 5 grains per pint,

the nitric-acid method gave 1-16 gi-ain of impure lu'ic acid ; the ordinary* hydro-

chloric-acid method 5-53 grains, the method above described 9-90 grains of uric acid.

The proportion of alcohol to the hydrochloric acid was then increased to the bulk

of the evaporate. The urine voided in twenty -four hours (35 fluid-ounces), of which

the Jicidity =15'7 grains of carbonate of potash, was neutralized and divided into

3 parts                              No. 1  (117  fluid-ounces) was evaporated to I'o fluid-ounce ;                              an equal bulk
                                  ;

of alcohol was added with 23 drachms of hydrochloric acid. To No. 2, 17-5 grains of

carbonate of potash were added, and it was then treated like No. 1. No. 3 was

treated like No. 2, but with the addition of 3 grains of uric acid dissolved in car-

bonate of potash. The three precipitates were severally washed, first with alcohol,

and lastly with equal proportions of acetic acid and water. The result was fol-

lows :

                                                    No. 1. No. 2.             No. 3.

   The urine of twenty-four hours (35-5 fluid-ozs.), of which the acidity =10 gi-ains

of carbonate of potash per pint, was neutralized and divided into four parts. No. 1
was treated in all respects Hke No. 1 of the above series. No. 2 was similarly
treated with the addition of 30 grains per pint of carbonate of potash neutralized.
No. 3 was treated like No. 2, with the addition of 2 grains of uric acid dissolved in
carbonate of potash. No. 4 was evaporated only to 3 fiuid-ounces ; the alcohol
added was only 1-7 fluid drachm ; in other respects it was treated like No. 2

but the precipitate of uric acid being more coloured than in Nos. 1, 2, and 3, it
was further washed with boiling alcoliol, which removed 0-14 grain of colouring-
matter, and still left it darker than the others, retaining, thatis, more of the colouring-
matter. The weight of uric acid obtained in the four experiments was as follows :--

      Uric acid  No. 1.  No. 2.             No. 3.    No. 4.
                  7-44    7-80                      7-30 grains.
                                     9-50-2=7-50

  Two further experiments were made, in both of which the proportion of one

grain only of uric acid was superadded to the urine of twenty-four hours, the pro-
cess employed being the same in other respects as that of No. 1 in the preceding
experiments. The results were as follow :

  =1. Uric acid without addition 7 -90 grains.
        = -- =,, ,, with addition of one grain S-74, or 1 7-74 grains.

  =2. Uric acid without addition 7'G7 grains.
       ==8,, ,, with addition of one grain -42, or- 1 7-42 grains.

In the first of these two last experiments the alcoholic acid was decanted from the
precipitate previous to filtration after standing for only ninvti-en hours, and an
interval considerably less would probably sutfice. The uniformity of these results

deserve to be remarked.

  --On the whole it appears that the best process for determining the quantity of

uric acid in urine is the following : To neutralize a third or fourth part of the
urine of twenty-four hours, if alkaline with hydrochloric acid, or of acid with car-
bonate of potash, to reduce this to 1'5 fluid-ounce, to treat it with 3 drachms of
hydrochloric acid, combined with 1'5 fluid-ounce of alcohol, to decant when the
liquid is clear, to wash the deposit first with alcohol, and when that dissolves no
more, with equal parts of acetic acid and water ; and it also appears that the
amount of alkalinity in the urine, after being neutralized, does not effect the pre-
cipitate or detract from the accuracy of the determination. It may also be con-

cluded that notwithstanding the variability of the quantity of uric acid in dif-
ferent states of the system, if under imiform conditions of health and diet, expe-
 riments be first made, in the manner described, on the natural urine, a sufficiently

exact average determination may be made of the normal quantity of uric acid an-

 tecedent to the alkaline treatment, and that if the alkaline treatment subsequently

 furnishes a grain or two more of uric acid, this may be relied upon as evidence

 that the uric-acid calculus in the bladder is undergoing solution.

    Though the foregoing researches have failed to realize the expectation of testing
 by analysis the effect of the solvent treatment on vesical calculus, a fact observed
 during the whole course of that treatment, and not afteiT^-ards, appeared to indi-
 cate that a solvent action was really going on. This fact consisted in a small but
 constant amoimt of deposit, in which fragmentary particles of uric acid were
 discerned by the microscope enveloped in mucus, resembling, in the opinion of Mr.
 Spencer Wells, as well as of the author and his assistant *, tlie detritus left by the
 incomplete action of carbonate of potash on uric-acid calculi, and such as might

 have been washed out of the bladder in consequence of partial solution. That no
 such solution should have been brought into evidence by the many determinations
 of uric acid, however imperfect, here described, if it cannot be fully accounted for

 by that imperfection, may possibly be due to a physiological effect of the alkaline
 treatment in preventing the formation of uric acid, which may have counter-
 balanced the excess expected from solution of the calculus. To ascertain these
 points, as has been stated above, two sets of experiments are required, one in a case

  in which calculus is prese7it, and one in which it is absent, in both of which the

 process for determining the quantity of uric acid here recommended may be of use.
     The author stated his conviction, from liis own experience of the effects of

  citrate of potash not exceeding 300 grains taken in twenty-four hours, and pro-

  ducing an alkalinity equalling from 20 to 35 grains of carbonate of potash con-

  tinued during three months, that no disadvantage to health need be feared from

been for some years an invalid. Neither during or since the treatment has any

irritation of tlie bhidder &c. been felt, and the urine has been for many months

perfectly clear and free from mucus ; it has never been ammoniacal when voided,

and has contained no albumen. The calculus was judged to be uric from the

previous passage of crj'stals of uric acid. Since the treatment no uric acid has

appeared in it, except once recentlj', and 2o grains of citrate of potash are found

suHicient to prevent its recurrence.

There is one prominent chemical fact attending these experiments which remains

to be noticed, viz. a great diminution in the quantity of the mineral acids subse-

quent to the allcaline treatment ; whilst from 120 to 150 grains of citrate of potash

were required for neutrality in August 18G8, in March and April 1869 from 30 to

--60 grains sufficed for the same purpose. Dr. Thudichum's analysis in September

1868 gave of sulphuric acid ol'l, of phosphoric 4o-7 grains. The analysis made

--in the author's laboratory in March 1869 gave, sulphuric acid 25-9, of phosphoric

34-2 grains, a difterence scarcely to be accounted for without reference to the alka-

line treatment undergone in the first three mouths of the interval ; and it is worthy

of remark that a similar reduction seems to have taken place in the amount of urio

acid.

In further continuation of previous researches as to the clinical value and pecu-

liarities of chloroform, ether, and other ansesthetics, the author invited discussion

on some conflicting opinions and ideas amongst physiologists, as to the precise

nature of anaesthesia itself, particularly under nitrous protoxide, contrasted with

chloral and chloroform                                                                                                          the relation of sleep to anaesthesia                                                                                                                                                             the exact physiology
                                                                                                                             ;                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

of sleep, so intimately bound up with medical treatment, in mania, fever, delirium

tremens, puerperal convulsions, and other diseases, where chloroform is sometimes

inadmissible, but at other times of great value, as in the " shock" of large surgical

or mechanical injuries to limbs, according as the practitioner has to treat pain and

irritation, or, on the other hand, exhaustion and inflammation.

Two, if not three forms of accident, as seen in hospital practice, as contradis-

tinguished from the simple suflbcation of animals in experiments on the methy-

lene series, were explained ; the chief one, sudden failure, not of the heart as

popularly believed, but of the laryngeal recurrent nerve and others distributed to

the larynx, causing spasm, or sudden apnoea. Deaths have occurred from the use of

" ether mixtures," and while every precaution was taken ; and while using the

'' Clover-apparatus," supposed to be safe ; but in a vast number of cases, by proper

precaution at the moment, and notably by use of electricity, the danger may

be warded off. Fatal accidents, in fact, are most common, not in the deep nar-

cotism of chloroform, but in the early excitement stage when reflex action is still

active, and chiefly hitherto in healthy active adidts for trivial small operations,

rather than in old unhealthy subjects with fatty heart or in large operations.

Again, connected not indirectly with the nature of antesthesia, is the nature of

ordinary "sleep," the latter a state of rest of the active molecular work previously

going on, with a restoration of the power. Can this condition depend on venous con-

gestion of the choroid plexus and such vascular parts, or on the opposite state of

the brain vessels ? Facts abound on each side, yet the question is undecided

though at the threshold of a world of phenomena and accurate treatment in fevers,

delirium tremens, mania, bad surgical accidents, with delirium, &c. Nearly all
our recent vast improvements in surgery, ovariotomy, especially large amputations,

Ca^sarean section, are due to chloroform, and probably better views as to "shock,"

and how .sleep is to be obtained, and rest for the nervous system ; chloroform in

puerperal convulsions, in tedious cases requiring "version," not only gives rest to

the nervous system, but is a directly curative agent, as well as taking away pain.
The author next illustrated various half-cleared up points as to sleep and anajs-
thesia, by what has been learned during the year of the extraordinary action of the

nitrous protoxide, or " laughing gas," in London hospital practice. This " gas,"
at first condemned from mere experiments on rabhits as the most deadly of all the
anaesthetics, proves to be in man the least deadly. In one hundred thousand cases
there has been perhaps no death due to the gas itself. One or two accidents have
been noted in dental practice from foreign bodies, loose teeth, or the cork used
to keep the jaws asunder slipping into tlie relaxed glottis. This gas neither
enters into combination with the blood, as ether for instance, nor does it produce
change in the blood as carbonic oxide, nor is it changed itself; it is, in a word,
quite passive, and offers to the notice of physiologists, the author believes, a pas-

sive agent, taking the place of atmospheric air in the lungs.

   As to the physiology of common " sleep," opposite instances were cited of sleep

from venous congestion, and sleep from vascular anaemia. In sleep the pupils are
contracted in children and fontanelles depressed. The ophthalmoscope, too, bears

out Mr. Durham's theory of anasmia ; or, is it because we sleep, the brain becomes

anffimic (independent of vaso-motor or ganglionic action, as urged by Mr. Moore) ?
Sleep is the chief remedy in delirium tremens ; and here digitalis is superior to

chloral as a remedy.

   Even the spectroscope can detect no change in the blood when the nitrous

--oxide is inhaled indeed there is not sufficient time in the forty or fifty seconds

during which the gas begins to act before sudden asphyxia takes place, for the
complex changes to occur supposed by Dr. Marcet and others ; even the same ten

gallons of gas thus unchanged may be inhaled over and over again by the same
patient with like results of complete insensibility, going off almost in a moment
when the inhalation is stopped, and atmospheric air allowed into the lung. The
author in previous memoirs in the ' Transactions,' from observation in London
hospitals in over 20,000 cases of chloroform administration, papers read at New-

castle, Oxford, &c., was led to doubt that the principle on which the Clover
apparatus, that of cardiac syncope, is constructed is always true, so that patients
die of cardiac exhaustion in every instance ; he thinks now, if any fact or sugges-
tion were wanting to complete the proof, it is this cardiac exhaustion under this
gas far greater than under chloroform, and yet the patients invariably recover in
three to four minutes ; the pulse under chloroform never sinks, it rises ; the pulse

under this gas gradually sinks till it is almost imperceptible.
   The iustantaneousness of the insensibility and tlie waking up are not unlike the

falling asleep under ordinary sleep ; deficient oxidation runs parallel with the sleep,
but the change is a "vital" one; oxidation alone will no more explain it than

explain a fit of chorea or epilepsy. The microscopic examination goes deeper, and
shows the blood-corpuscles and brain, or gi-ey matter (protagon) , altered by one set of
anresthetics but not by others ; the author, in fine, concludes that deaths from
chloroform are more frequent from emotion or fright on the part of the patient

than cardiac exhaustion from deficient oxidation.
    Experiments with methylene on animals, or chloral or ether "mixtures," so

strongly recommended from theoretic ideas by the Eoyal Medical and Chirurgical
Society (though previously abandoned in Austria, where they had been enforced
by government authority), experiments with the nitrous oxide, on the supposition
that it is more dangerous than terchloride of carbon, with voltaic narcotism,
or with some patent mixture or ether, are experiments that frighten patients and
lessen their faith in simple chloroform, and things that cause confusion, founded

 on the theory of deficient oxidation alone, and have only retarded the progress of
 anaesthetics ; nor is a fatty heart one of the chief sources of danger, at least as far

--as is shown by 300 cases of deaths from chloroform collected by the author from

journals, mostly cases of healthy adidt men attacked with sudden apncea from

 alarm or fright at viewing the preparation of kni^"es, saws, &c. for the operation,

the tears and grief of friends, &c., or of men who were bad subjects for opera-

tion, with healthy heart, from the presence of delirium tremens, want of sleep,

want of food, &c. The Association would now confer a great benefit on the public

 if these 300 or .350 cases were carefully tabulated, and the deductions as to age,

 sex, disease, character of accident (apncsa or asphyxia), post-mortem result, &c.

 were marked out. Electricity to the diaphragm has proved in many late chlo-

 roform cases most valuable, since the idea of apncea, in place of fatty heart, has
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

other accidents, such as drowning-, suH'ocation in coal mines, &c., the artificial

has astonished j^^ood observers in German}-, America, Australia, &c.

    In this communication attention -was dra-wn to the peculiarities of the den-
droidal forms developed upon some purely mineral crystals -when immersed in
v\-eak solutions of silicate of soda, and some additions were made to the observa-
tions upon this subject read at the Meeting of tlie Association at Dundee in 1867.

It was then pointed out that when crystals of sulphate of iron, sulphate of copper,
or some other mineral salts are immersed in a dilute solution of silicate of soda in
the course of a few hours branches shoot perpendicularly upwards in the liquid
presenting a remarkable resemblance to the branches of some vegetation. These
branches are straighter in a rather stronger solution, more contorted, and some-
times distinctly spiral, when the solution is somewhat weaker; but results are

parallel branches, after gTowing side by side for a time, -will approximate and

a^ain anastomose into a single trunk. At the base those developed on sulphate
ot iron may have a diameter of one-sixteenth

The author had stated at Dundee his opinion that the terminations of branches

still in process of elongation presented pointed extremities, which -svere carried

forward as growth proceeds, necessarily implying an interstitial mode of increase.
But haying since made an arrangement by which branches may be observed mi-

croscopically in the act of growth, he must n<^w correct that statement. No change

of size or form can be observed in a branch subsequent to its first development

but as a branch elongates, it narrows as the power of growth fails, and when the'

needle-shaped point is formed, there i.s no more elongation. The growing-point of
an elongating branch, as seen under the microscope, appears enveloped in a slio-ht

cloudiness in the liquid medium, which is gTadually lifted up and precedes the

extremity of the elongating branch, whose gradual and continuous development

presents a very curious appearance. The branches are delicate tubes, havino- thin

Description of an Apparatus for Measuring and Recording the Respiratory

   and Cardiac Movements of the Chest. By J. Buedon Sanderson, M.D.,

    F.R.S.

   The purposes which this instrument is intended to answer are (1) to measure
accurately any given diameter of the chest, (2) to determine the extent of those
rhythmical variations of that diameter which are due to breathing and to the

movements of the heart, and (3) to record the results mechanically on a cylinder
revolving at a known rate by clockwork.

   To accomplish these objects various methods have been employed by physiolo-
gists. The most accurate is that contrived by M. Marey. The subject of obser-
vation is placed on a chair, against the back of which he is directed to lean. The
measuring-apparatus is supported on a table at a short distance from the front of
the chest. Its construction is such that the variations of distance between the
anterior surface of the chest and the instrument (i. e. the table on which it rests)
are transmitted to a lever, by which they are inscribed on the recording-cylinder.
The instrument which has been recently introduced and exhibited in London by
Dr. Hawksley is constructed on the same pi'inciple. Both methods are subject to
a fundamental objection, namely that the curve inscribed on the cylinder expresses,

not the variations of the diameter of the chest, but the \ariations of distance between

the surface of tlie chest and the table. If it were possible to render the spinal

column of tlie subject of observation absolutely immoveable the objection would be

groundless, for the two variations  referred to woidd be the  same                            but, practically,
                                                                                           ;

any such fixation of the spinal column is impossible. Irregular contractions of the

muscles of the back occur constantly, and are of such extent that no method of

measurement in which they are disregarded can pretend to accuracy. If it be

alleged that they are so trivial as not materially to impair the general accuracy of

the tracing, I reply that, although they are in themselves inconsiderable, they are
enormous in proportion to the extent of the rhythmical movements to be measured.

Some of these movements do not exceed yi^ of an inch ; consequently an accidental
jerk, even if it amounted to only half that distance, would entirely vitiate the

result.

In the instrument exhibited to the Section this error is entirelj' avoided. It con-

sists of two parts, viz. (1) a light frame
of wrought iron which is applied to tlie
chest, and (2) the apparatus by which
the movements are transmitted to the re-
cording-cylinder. The construction can

be understood by referring to the sketch
in the margin. The letters a b c indicate
the frame of wrought iron ; rf is a rod of
brass which is graduated, and slides
through a socket in the arm a, termi-
nating in a knob covered with wash-
leather, h. c is a steel spring which is

fixed to the frame a b c at /, in such a
position that it is parallel to the arm c.

The end of the spring bears on its in-
ner surface a button, similar in form and

size to h, and on its outer surface a cir-

Acular plate, /. similar plate is screwed

on to the inner surface of the arm c in

such a position that the two disks face
each other. Between the two disks is
placed, when the instrument is in use,
a disk-shaped bag (k) of vulcanized caoutchouc, the mouth of which com-

mimicates witli a long flexible tube; the opposite end of the tube is in connexion

with the drum of Marey's cardiograph. The effect of this arrangement is, that

--when the frame is adapted to any diameter of the chest as, e.f/.,ihe antero-poste-
--rior in such a manner that while the button h is applied to the spine, the button

ff is pressed by the spring against the sternum, all, even the most minute, variations
of the particular diameter investigated are inscribed on the cylinder. The tracing
so obtained presents characters, as regards sharpness and regularity of contour, which
to the eye accustomed to the examination of kymographic tracings, appear exceed-

ingly satisfactory.

   The author claims for this instrument the following advantages, viz. (1) that it
affords to the physiologist a means of recording the rhythmical movements of the
chest, either in man or animals, with greater accuracy than is possible by any method
previouslv employed, and (2) that from its simplicity it is applicable to the purposes
of clinical observation. Here, as in every case in which instruments of exactitude

are employed, especially for the investigation of the functions of respiration, the

fact that the patient is conscious that he is under observation is apt to interfere
with the accuracy of the result. This difficulty cannot be entirely overcome. In
consequence of it a large proportion of observations made on patients are rendered
valueless. Its existence affords, however, no excuse for contenting ourselves with
clumsy instruments and inexact methods of research. It rather points to the
necessity of improving and simplifjang these methods and instruments to the

utmost, and of acquiring the greatest attainable skill in their use. At the same
time it is to be borne in mind that neither instruments nor skill will be of much
service unless the observer is possessed of that tact in the management of patients
by which alone disturbing emotions can be calmed and controlled.

and the range of linguistic variation observable in the very limited area of Eastern

   The author called attention to the fact that Aborigines, evidently allied to the

Tasmanians, existed in the North Pacific, in New Guinea, New Caledonia, New

probably the Pre-Maori inhabitants of New Zealand. Most of these, the Tas-

struction of boats. Unless, therefore, the Polygenistic idea be received, that they
grew where they were found, they must have been at one period geographically
connected. Their migration could only have taken place on land.

  A gi-eat number of interesting particulars, from such authorities as Dr. Hooker,

Dr. Owen, Prof. Huxley, &c., were adduced to show the plausibilit}' of the theory of
the existence of a former southern continent. The remarkable relation of ilora be-

tween Australia and South Africa, and Australia (with Tasmania) and New Zealand,

went to prove the position. Geology established the opinion of previous connexion

of a number of the islands with the continent of New Holland. At the time of the

gradual submergence of the old southern continent, many of these ancient races

had reached to the outside limits, and were thus preserved.
   The author contended for the high antiquity of man, in order to reconcile the

difficulties affecting the origin of the Tasmanians, as well as to support the doctrine

of the unity of the human species. On botanical and geological grounds, the

inhabited land of the Tasmanians was conjectured to have been part of a great
continent at a time when most parts of Europe and Asia were beneath the ocean.

        On a Orannoge in Wales. By the Rev. Edgar N. Dtjmbleton.

In the Lake of Llangorse, Brecknockshire, is an island about 90 yards in circum-

ference, and situated about 120 yards from the northern shore. Until two years

ago no idea was entertained that this had anj'thing remarkable about it.
   The angular appearance of the stones exposed at the margin first suggested the

thought that this island was no part of the natural structure of the lake-basin, and

subsequent investigation has shown that the whole material has been conveyed

from the main land and lieaped w-ithin flat piles. Ot these about fifty may be

counted about the edge of the Orannoge. They are from 4 to 5 feet in length, of

oak, and are well shaped, and pointed with a sharp metal instrument ; the cuts are

plainly visible, and resemble those made by an adze. The material of the island

--IS first, faggot wood and reeds, then loose mould, with but few stones, in which

is a considerable layer of charcoal, at about one foot from the level of the lake

nearer the surface the stones are more frequent; the whole does not exceed 5 feet

above the surface of the water.

In all parts of the island, and at all levels, are found large quantities of bones, as

well as in the shallow water all round ; very many of these are broken or split into

Afragments.  package of these bones was sent to Professor Rolleston, who pro-

noimced them to exhibit two varieties of horse, also the remains of the ox, the

sheep, and pig. Other specimens of bones found on the island were shown at the

Meenng, and were asserted to be those of the wild boar, red deer, and Bos longi-

frons.

Very little in the way of human implements has been found. One stone and a

bone appeared to have been shaped for use, and some fragments of leather, pierced

to admit sewing material, came to light. That there have been wooden structures

about and upon this island appears evident, the remains being plentiful, both about

the edge and under the water.

On the Discovery of Flint Implements of Palceolithic Type in the Gravel of the
        Thames Valley at Acton and Ealing. By Colonel A. Lane Pox.

 _ Dm-iug the first six months of the present year (1869) the author devoted some
time to an examination of the gravels, brick-earth, and surface-soils on the northern
side of the Thames valley, between Shepherd's Bush and Ealing.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  131

    In the nearly flat portion of the valley adjoining the river which lies between
Hammersmith, Shepherd's Bush, and Acton, the surface of which averages 5 to 10
feet above high-water mark, several cuttings were being made in the brick-earth,
which here lies to a thickness of 10 to 12 feet upon the gi-avel.

   The workmen had the appearance of flint flakes and implements explained to
them, by showing them specimens from other localities, and rewards were ofi'ered
to induce them to preserve any similar implements they might And during the
excavations, but no trace of the fabrication of flint implements was found in the area
above specified. This would tend to give some contirmation to the conjecture that
this portion of the bottom of the valley may have been excavated by the river more

recently than the Palseolithic period.

   At Acton the Uxbridge road passes over the natural slope which bounds the
plain on the north, and which rises fi-om 10 to 40 and 80 feet above high-water

mark.

   The upper portion of this slope near Acton is capped with gravel, which overlies
the London Clay, and varies from 6 to 12 feet in thickness. In Acton village it is
18 feet thick, and it was shown, by a cutting made for a sewer in the direction of the
Great Western Railway Station, that it thins out northward. It is very variously
stratified, in alternate layers of subangular gi-avel and yellow and white sand, with
red and yellow stains. In some places the sand and gravel lie in horizontal bands,
of greater or less thickness, above each other ; in others the strata are very much
contorted and undulating, thinning out in various directions, and sometimes turn-

ing up almost perpendicularly, indicating probably the existence of floods or currents,

or winding watercourses at the time when the river ran at this higher level. The
gravel consists chiefly of subangular flints, mixed with rounded quartz and quartzite
pebbles. No trace of freshwater shells or of animal remains have yet been found

in this drift-gravel.

   This is the flrst patch of gi-avel as we go westward from London which lies so

high above the river, all the high ground to the north in the direction of WiUesden,
and to the north-east in the direction of Hampstead and Highgate being composed of
the London Clay, whilst to the south and south-east, as already mentioned, the

gi'avel and brick-earth is at a much lower level. The position on the sides of the
valley corresponds so exactly to that in which implements have been found in the
valleys of the Somme, the Ouse, and elsewhere, that the author determined to make
a close examination of the cuttings that were being made for the erection of new

buildings, and for that purpose paid almost daily visits to the place for some months.
The result has been to bring to light several implements of the antique form, usually
found in drift-gravel, and others of more modern type.

  To the east of the East Acton Station, on the Willesden and Kew line, the gravel

had been disturbed at some former period. Some cuttings were being made for the
foundations of buildings at about 40 feet above high-water mark. All the worked

flints found here were of surface type, consisting of numerous small flakes, one or
two small scrapers, a chipped knife or spear-head, and, lastly, a chipped celt, with-
out any trace of grinding, corresponding in form to those, a large hoard of which
were lately discovered by the author at Cissbury in Sussex, and have been described

in the ' Archseologia.' This class of implement may probably be regarded as form-

ing an intermediate link between the Palifiolithic and Neolithic types.
   To the west of the Station the gravel was undisturbed, and stratifled in the

manner already described ; the surface rises to 60 and 80 feet above high-water
mai'k. It was in this gravel that the implements of Palaeolithic type were dis-
covered. They consist of numerous flakes, of larger size than those found at the
lower level to the east of the Station, one or two cores from which flakes had been de-
tached ; but these were not in suflicient number to denote that the fabrication of flints

--to any great extent had been conducted here two large and roughly made scrapers

and five implements. One implement of oval type was found under 7 feet of strati-
fied sand and gravel, resting on the clay beneath, another of pointed type was found
in the middle of the gravel, about 10 feet Irom the surface, and beneath a layer of
sand 8 feet in thickness. Three other implements of similar forms were found on
the roads in the neighbourhood, in gi-avel that had been excavated from the same
locality, and from Mill Hill, half a mile to the westward; and one well-formed

                                                                                                   9*

flake was found in a cutting in Acton village, as mucli as 18 feet from the surface.
Althougli the author did not succeed in himself finding any of these implements
in situ, he took all the stejDS necessary to ascertain the correctness of the reports
given him by the workmen, and he has no reason to doubt the accuracy ot the
positions here given. The majority of the flakes appeared to have been rubbed and
chipped by use, leaving concave scallops on the edges of the flint. All the imple-
ments and flakes were of the ochreous colour of the gravel, and they appeared by
their edges to have been much rolled in the gravel. The author also found two
very well-formed implements at Ealing Dean, at a spot the height of which is given
as 92 feet above mean water-mark in the Ordnance 6-inch map. (All these imple-
ments were exhibited at the Meeting of the Association.)

   The value of the discovery consists in its extending our knowledge of the dis-
tribution of these implements higher up the main valley of the Thames than they
have been found hitherto. It is well known that implements of Palasolithic type
have been found near Reculvers, at about .50 feet above the sea-level. The earliest
recorded discovery of a Drift implement was that found at the commencement of
the last century, near Gray's Inn Lane, at a height of probably from 50 to 60 feet
and Mr. Evans has lately discovered one at a higher level near Highbury.

   Though evidently of much less common occurrence in the Thames valley than
in those of the Somme, the Ouse, and other rivers in which they have been found,

there appears to be no reason to doubt that they are as widelj^ distributed, and that
they occupy corresponding positions to those which have been found in the above-
named rivers.

                       On the Brain of a Negro. By R. Gaener, F.R.C.S., F.L.S.

The author, in a previous paper read at the British Association, described his

method of making casts of the brain, flrst hardening them in a solution of corrosive

sublimate, about 1 oz. to 1 pint of water at 60^ F., that is of the speciflc gravity of

the brain itself, I'OoS. The Negro, of whose brain a cast was shown, though by no

means of quite black skin, was apparently of pure blood, judging from the shape of

his head and face, and woolly hair. He was a tall man, and when able to follow

his employment, acted as cook on board a ship, and in private families. He was

intelligent, and apparently had been placed in more favom-able circumstances for

mental development than the generality of his race.

The Negro skull is generally thick and heavy, as was the case here ; the parietals

are not unfrequeutly cut oft' from joining the sphenoidal wings in the temples, and

there appear to be one or two other little imperfections, so called. The brain is

commonly long and narrow, but high, as it was in the instance in question. Ac-

cording to Morton the Negro's brain, compared with the Englishman's in weight,

is only as &2 to 96. But the brain of the Negro in question weighed 49 oz., the

full weight of the Englishman's ; and, generally speaking, the convolutions may be

called rich, more so than those of the ordinary Englisliman, and more so than

those of an Englishman's brain exhibited, though the latter was of course wider or

brachycephalic. This Englishman was well known to the author. He could read,

write, and sum well, was quite of average intelligence, but self-indulgent in regard

to drink, and choleric, and had been a soldier and servant. If mere name were

anything he ought to be of our noblest blood, but probably he had no such claim.

The prognathousness of the Negro, to whatever due, is attended with a Ions

brain, but whether he is the better or the worse for this, or whether anj' other un-

common shape of brain has very much effect on the faculties, or what, is difiicult

to say. The Negro's prognathousness seems to affect his voice, which is commonly

rather guttural than sonorous. The brains of imbeciles have commonly all the

convolutions, though of course less developed, and the author doubts whether the

performance of any particular faculty can be attributed to any particular convolu-

tion                   language,  for instance,  as  distinguished  from its merely lingual and oral por-

tion, requires tlie development of the convolutions in general, and not of the ex-
ternal temporal gyri in particular. Wideness of skull, as seen in most of the

dominant races, the author would set down rather to bodily conformation than to
the reason the phrenologist would give. The Negro brain is well developed as

regards the posterior lobe, whether this be a perfection or the reverse probably it
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

is less a character of the brain of the Quadrumana, than of them and Bimaua,
smooth in monkeys, with gyri in man.

   The brain in the Negro in question is more developed than that figured so well
by Calori. The lobules of the orbit are certainly simple, but the frontal convolutions
are rather rich, the temporal lobes deep and long, the fissure of Rolando not
situated so far bade as in many Europeans, but this is due rather to a fulness of the
convolutions behind (where, at the summit of the brain, they are rich and extend as
far back as the post-parietal lobe, cuneus, and annectent gyri) than to the poverty

of those before.

   The sulci were in places an inch deep the grey matter looked dusky, but there
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

was no dark pigment in the arachnoid as we see in some animals. The author

thinks that it is a misnomer to call the fissure of Rolando the coronal Jissure, there
being another sufficiently well marked under the coronal suture, the direction ot
which the first does not follow.

   Though our prepossessions may be that the Negro is in his place as the labourer of

the hot regions of the earth, servant and not master, and that he is not of the most

highly organized race of man, yet the cast seems to show that he may be very

capable of improvement though still retaining his peculiar characteristics, but to
what extent and in what direction has not perhaps been fairly tried, and not set
about in the right way.

   The author anticipates that light will be thrown on the brain by a more precise
indication of the course of its formative fibres, resjiecting which no two authorities
agree. The mere topography of the organ has now been sufficiently made out, it
remains to connect it with fibrillation and formation.

   The cast of an old man's brain, oet. 97, which was exhibited, exemplified how
much the gyri shrink in old age, whilst the sulci enlarge, corresponding atrophy

occurring in all the other organs of the body ; whilst the brain of the deceased con-
sumptive retains all the plumpness of the healthy organ.

    In judging of the brain from its size, several qualifications must be made, the

size of the individual for instance. Unless we make such a qualification we might

conclude that the elephant is wiser than man, or the Chinese giant than all other
men, as he can get on no other man's hat.

                 On the Paucity of Aboruiinal Monuments in Canada.
                     By Sir Duncan Gibb, Bart., M,D., F.G.S.

   The ordinary sepulchral remains commonly found in various parts of the country
with fiint implements, pottery, &c., were excluded in this inquirj'. It was confined
to true Aboriginal monuments built of stone, such as are met with in Central
America and Peru. Their scarcity and almost complete absence he attributed to
the peculiar character of the climate, which would be imfavourable to their pre-
servation, unless constantly looked after as in modern times. The mounds existing
in the heart of the country north of Lake Ontario, though often filled with broken
granite, were not regular buildings, and the frost and ice exerted no destructive

influence upon them. He anticipated the discovery some day of traces of the

ancient inhabitants in the gi'eat caverns north of Flamliorough, and possibly in
similar caverns which he conjectured would be found in the i-sland of Anticosti,
composed of similar rocks belonging to the Middle Silurian formation.

                On an Obstacle to European Longevity beyond 70 years.
                      By Sir Duncan Gibb, Bart., M.D., F.G.S.

   The author had previously drawn attention to the position of the leaf-shaped
cartilage at the root of the tongue, known as the epiglottis, in 5000 people of all
ages, and in 11 per cent, it was found to be drooping or pendent in place of being ver-

tical. He discovered the important fact that in all persons over 70 its position was

--vertical, without a single exception a circumstance of the highest importance bear-

ing upon the attainment of old age amongst Europeans. In a number of instances,
where the age varied from 70 to 9.5, in all was this cartilage vertical. Man}^ of
these he cited as exaniples, such as the well-known statesmen, Lord Palmerston,

Lord Lyndhurst, Lord Campbell, and Lord Brougham. He also gave some among

old ladies still alive at ages from 76 to 92, whose epiglottis was vertical. But the

most remarakable was that of a gentleman still alive, 102 years old, in whom it

occupied the same position. His facts clearly demonstrated that longevity beyond

70 could not be attained with a pendent epiglottis. The author summed up his

--views in the following conclusions : 1. As a rule persons with a pendent epiglottis

do not attain a longevitj' bej^ond 70. Possibly a few may overstep it, but such
examples are exceptional. 2. With pendency of the epiglottis life verges to a close

Aat or about 70, and the limit of old age is readied. 3. vertical epiglottis, on the

other hand, allows of tlie attainment of fourscore years and upwards, all other
things being equal, and affords the best chance of reaching the extremest limit of
longevity. Lastly, pendency of the epiglottis is an obstacle to longevity certainly
beyond the age of 70 years, and it is a peculiarity that occurs in 11 per cent, of all
ages amongst Europeans.

                 On a Cause of Diminished Longevitif among tJie Jews.

                      By Sir "Dttncan Gieb, Bart., M.D., F.G.S.

   The author stated that a considerable portion of the Jewish race possesses a
physiognomy to which he gave the name of sanguineo-oleaginous expression, cha-
racterized by varying degrees of flushed face, sleepy aspect, greasy look, guttural
or husky voice, and fulness of body. The best examples of the class are to be
seen in the furniture auction-rooms of the metropolis. With this expression is
usually associated pendency of the epiglottis. As a rule longevity is rare among
such persons, for they are liable to those diseases of a congestive character which
influence the heart, brain, and liver. The cause of all this is eating food, especially
fish cooked in oil, which tends to the destructive formative processes in the system,
and induces premature old age, although the individual maj' appear to be tlie per-
sonification of comparatively good healtb. The extensive use of oil in the south of
Em'ope has the same effect in giving rise to congestive diseases and diminished
longevity. Pendency of the epiglottis, associated with the sanguineo-oleaginous

                                                              _

expression, is of serious import. The persistent use of oil, therefore, as an article of

diet, is pernicious, vmless in persons of spare habit of body, delicate constitution,

and liability to disease wherein its employment woidd prove usefid.

On the Method of forming the Flint Flakes used hi/ the early inhabitants of

     Devon, in Prehistoric Times. By Townshend M. Hall, F.G.S. Sfc.

The flint flakes and chippings found distributed throughout the soil in several

parts of North Devon, and those associated with the submerged forest at Northam,

occur so abundantly that the question has sometimes been raised, whether or not

they may have been naturally formed, or whether they may not be the results of
some unknown kind of accidental fracture.

In about ten different localities flint cores have been foimd buried with the

flakes                         and from  a  careful  observation of them  it  appears  that  they are of great
                            ;

importance in deciding this point ; for whilst a flake may possibly in some cases

be caused by an accidental blow, the cores show unmistakable evidence of design.
They show also that, owing to the extreme scarcity of flint all through the northern

parts of Devon and Cornwall, the early inhabitants appear to have adopted in these

districts a somewhat peculiar method of forming the flint flakes, which were pro-

bably used by them as knives and scrapers for domestic purposes, or as darts and
arrowheads for war and the chase.

This method, the author stated, differed considerably from that which prevailed

in flint-producing countries, and it seemed as if the value of the material was such
                            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                  135

as to induce the makers of these flint tools to adopt a plan by which the maximum
number were obtained with a minimum amount of waste.

All the flint flakes and cores from the ten different stations, ranging along the

coast from Croyde to Bude, show a singular uniformity in their design, and the

Amethod by which they were formed appears to have been as follows.                                         nodule

having been selected, a flat surface or base was tirst formed by striking oflT one end,

as near the point as possible. If the flint was cherty, or showed an uneven and

hackly fracture, it seems to have been rejected in this first stage of its manufac-

ture                        but if, on the other  hand, it split with a smooth conchoidal fracture, a series
                         ;

of blows were administered from the flat surface, at intervals round the margin,

so as to peel oft" the rough coating of the nodule on three sides. The second

series of blows produced the largest flakes, and a third or even a fourth set of flakes

could be obtained in this manner before the core was used up.

This peculiarity was noticed by the author about two years ago, in the coiu'se of

a communication to the Society of Antiquaries, and a subsequent examination of

many hundred flakes and cores has served to prove that the same process was in

use throughout the whole of this district.

The largest flakes hitherto foimd in North Devon are about three inches in length,

but between these and the smallest, which measm'e not more than three-quarters

of an inch, there are innumerable gradations in size. The results of the principal

excavations which have been made at Croyde and Northam, show that the average

proportion of cores to flakes is about 14 per cent.

         On the Circassians or White Khazars*. By H. H. Howobth.

   The author detailed the history of the Circassians and Kabardiens from the 12th
century downwards. Before the arrival of the Turks, Comans, &c. the chief race in
the plains of the Kuban and the Crimea were the Khazars, a race well known to

the Byzantines and Arabians. When the name Khazar disappears, that of Cir-

cassian appears, and from a comparison of the language, customs, and traditions
of both races, the author proved them to be one race under two names, and that
the Circassians are the descendants of the White Khazars.

        On a Frontier of Ethnology and Geology*. By H. H. Howoeth.

   The Isothermals in Europe are twisted far to the north of the normal course

they follow in Asia and America. This twisting has not always existed, as is
proved by the fauna and flora of prehistoric times, and by the remarks of the

Greek and Roman geographers on the climate of Central Europe. Their gradual

movement, synchronous with the gradual pushing back of the limit of the fauna
and flora of prehistoric times towards Siberia, the author correlated with the
gi-adual intrusion of the Iranian race of men, with its associated animals and
plants, into Europe, and the gradual displacement of the Ugrians ; the Ugrian

being as much a paL-eontologieal witness to ?uch a condition of things as we find
in Siberia, or as existed in prehistoric times, as the musk sheep or the reindeer.
The first intrusion of the Iranians into Europe, which the author coidd not date
before the 12th century B.C., marked the beginning of a new geologic period.
The climactic changes incident to it seem to be caused solely by the presence of
the Gulf-stream, so that if we can date the first giving way of the Ugrians, we
may possibly also date the first advent of the Gulf-stream.

especially in the periodical overflow of many of its rivers, it resembles Egypt.

Starting from Arica on the coast, in lat. 18° 27'"5, the railroad passes over 39

miles, to the town of Tacna, which is on the high road to the Cordilleras and

Bolivia. This is now a tree-less waste of sand, which sparkles with myriads of

hexagonal crystals of salt ; indeed scarcely a blade of grass is to be seen. Yet it

was formerly known as " the Forest of San Juan de Dios ;" and no doubt trees

were abundant, where now the traveller sees the mirage everj' day of the year.

At various times there have been found near the mummified bodies, in the

graves at Arica, small hemispherical objects of amber-looking matter; and occa-

sionally they have been found in the eye-holes of the skulls. These objects have

naturally been supposed to be  human                                                                     eyes                           but as  they  have  become  completely

solidified or hardened, they have been called incorrectly "petrijied human eyes."

Such being the simple facts of the case, I give the only theories which are

known on the subject, in the hope of eliciting some final decision, on the best

evidence, as to what the objects really are.

   1st. That they are hand fide human eyes.
   2nd. That they are the eyes offishes. Dr. MacDowell of Taboga, near Panama,
says, " The substance is evidently organic, but in no other way has it any atfiuity
with the human eye. With the difi'erence that the striated lines run transverse

instead of radial, it exactly resembles the eye of the shark. I lately made a dis-

section of one of these eyes, and hardened the lens in acetic acid, and it assumed

almost the exact appearance. I feel sure that they are the eyes of some similar

animal ; but it is a question for the microscope and for comparative anatomy.''

3rd. That they are the crystalline lenses of a Cephalopod, as shown on the

authority of Professors Clift and Owen, and Mr. Bowman.

4th. That they are vegetable matter, not animal.

Extract of a Letter from Dr. C, M. Tidy, of Cambridge Heath, Hackney :

" When I received the eye, I showed it to my colleague. Dr. Letheby, as well

Weas to the Professor of Comparative Anatomy at our hospital.                                                                                               were all agreed
--in this that it was not a human eye, nor was it the eye of an animal at all. Dr.

Letheby's impression at once was (and I perfectly agree with him) that it is a

resinoid exudation from some tree ; and this I proved further by analysis. The

form is at once explained by this, the concentric laminae also ; and the various

colours that are apparent may be explained by tlie length of time that elapsed

between the exudation of one lamina and another, and the amount of oxidation it

would undergo. I have myself no hesitation in stating that it is a vegetable and

not an animal substance."

To the last of these theories there is the obvious objection, that no such drip-

ping of gum is known, and in a district almost wholly destitute of vegetation

there is no tree to yield it. The second and third are open to a moral objec-

tion, viz. that the pagan Indian always regarded the future life as the repetition

of this one, with  slight varieties                                                                      and why should he represent a foreign body                 as
                                                                                                      ;

performing the functions of a natm-al part ? The living would not attach to the

dead the teeth of oxen or the leg of a mule. The opinion that they are human

eyes is less extensively and less confidently held than formerly ; but the whole

subject still requires a more thorough investigation.

                         By G. Henet Kinahan, M.R.I.A. 6fc.

   The author called attention to the various and numerous different races that from
the earliest period up to the reign of William III. came in masses into Ireland.

He took Co. Galway as an example, as it is believed to be one of the most Irish parts

of Ireland, and showed that nearly all the families in it are of foreign extraction.

He pointed out that in the hills of West Galway (Varconnaught), although the

worst land in Ireland, nearly all the inhabitants are of English descent, their an-
cestors being brought in at a comparatively recent date by the Martins, &c., to re-
generate the country ; the country, however, conquered, as their descendants became
so degenerate that the famous Colonel Martin had to get a law passed to prevent

them ploughing with the horses harnessed by their tails.
   The author stated that he believed no real type-Celt can now be found, as people

having Celtic names are exactly similar to those of foreign origin in complexion,
form, stature, &c. ; but he is inclined to believe that the nearest approach to the
true Celt vrill be found in some of the hill-countries, such as Slieve Phelin at the
junction of the counties of Tipperary and Limerick, or the Bui-ren in county of

Clare, &c.

         Notes on the Builders and the purposes of Merjalithic Monuments.

                                By A. L. Lewis, F.A.S.L.

  An almost unbroken chain of megalithic (Druidic) monuments extends from

India, through Persia and Asia Minor, the Mediterranean coasts and France, to
Britain and Scandinavia, those in India being still in use, and the whole having

throughout such a resemblance as could not possibly be accidental. This circum-
stance, with others, such as obsciu-e but identical superstitions, traditions, &c.
existing throughout this chain, induces the belief that these monuments were con-

structed under a common influence of some kind. The consideration of a variety

of facts leads to the conclusion that in Europe they were constructed by the
Celts under Druidic influence, but whether that influence was derived from India,
or whether India has been subjected to a Celtic influence of some sort, or whether

both India and Celticahave been influenced from some common source, is at present

uncertain.

   From the peculiar construction of the monuments, and from the uses to which
similar monuments are still put in India, it woidd seem that the alignments and

circles were used primarily as places of sacriflce, the dolmens or table-stones, of
which there are two classes, as places of sacriflce on the one hand, and places of
sepulture on the other, and the menhirs or single pillars as landmarks, comme-
morative pillars, tombstones, and possibly also, in some cases, as places of worship

or sacrifice.

--On the Origin of Civilization and the Primitive Condition of Man. Part II.

       By Sir John Lubbock, Bart., F.B.S., V.P.Ethn.Soc, 6,-c. Sfc. 6fc.

   At the Dundee Meeting of the British Association I had the honour of reading
a paper " On the Origin of Civilization and the Primitive Condition of Man.
The views therein advocated met with little opposition at the time. The then

Presidents of the Ethnological and Anthropological Societies both expressed their
concurrence in the conclusions to which I arrived ; and the memoir was ordered
to be printed in extenso. It has, however, subsequently been attacked at some

length by the Duke of Argyll*. As the Duke has in some cases strangely mis-

understood me, and in others (I am sure unintentionally) misrepresented my views,
and as the subject is one of great interest and importance, I am anxious, with the

permission of the Meeting, to make some remarks in reply to his Grace's criticisms,

--as well as to bring forward some additional arguments. The Duke has divided

his work into four chapters : I. Introduction ; II. The Origin of Man ; III. and

IV. His Primitive Condition.

   I did not in my first memoir, nor do I now, propose to, discuss the subjects dealt

with in the first half of the Duke's " Speculations." In using the expression

" First men or first beings worthy to be so-called," I did not intend to e.xpress any

opinion, but merely to indicate the alternative. I wish distinctly to point this out,
because the Duke so frequently quotes t'ne expression, from which he draws an
erroneous conclusion. I am, however, glad to find that he is not himself sufii-
ciently satisfied with his arguments to dispense with an appeal to the wishes
and failing of his readers. I must also observe that in attacking Prof. Huxley for

proposing to unite the Bimana and Quadrumana in one Order Primates, the Duke

uses a dangerous argument ; for if, on account of his great mental superiority over

the Quadrumana, Man forms an Order or even Class by himself, it will be im-

possible any longer to regard all men as belonging to one species or even to

one genus.

   The Duke is in error when he supposes that " mental powers and instincts
afford tests of easy application in other parts of the animal kingdom. On the con-

trary, genera with the most different mental powers and instincts are placed, not
only in the same Order, but even in the same family. Thus our most learned

hymenopterologist, Mr. Frederick Smith, classes the Hive-bee, the Humble-bee,

and the parasitic Apathus, in the same subfamily of Apidae. It seems to me,

therefore, illogical to separate man zoologically from the other primates on the

ground of his mental superiority, and yet to maintain the specitic unity of the

human race notwithstanding the mental differences between different races of men.

I did not, however, nor do I now, propose to discuss the origin of man, and pass

on therefore at once to the Duke's third chapter; and here I congratulate myself

at the outset that the result of my paper has been to satisfy him that " Whately's

argument *, though strong at some points, is at others open to assault, and that, as

a whole, the subject now requires to be differently handled, and regarded from a

different point of view." "I do not, therefore," he adds in a subsequent page t,
"agree with the late Archbishop of Dublin, that we are entitled to assume it as

a fact that, as regards the mechanical arts, no savage race has ever raised itself."

These are, indeed, important admissions; in fact the Duke, while supporting

Whately's conclusions, altogether abandons the arguments by which Whately

was convinced, and which he regarded as telling most strongly in their favour.

   I feel, however, less satisfaction on this account than would otherwise have been

the case, because it seems to me that though the Duke acknowledges the Arch-

bishop's argument to be untenable, he practically reproduces it with but a slight

alteration, and somewhat protected by obscurity. The Duke considers that "man
had instincts which afforded all that was necessary as a starting-ground." He

admits, however, that monkeys use stones to break nuts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   he might have added that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

they throw sticks at intruders. But he says, " between these rudiments of intel-

lectual perception and the next step (that of adapting and fashioning an instrument

for a particular purpose) there is a gulf in which lies the whole immeasureable

--distance between man and brutes." Yet in the very same page he adds the fol-

lowing sentence : " The wielding of a stick is, in all probability^, an act equally

of primitive intuition, and from this to throwing of a stick, and the use of javelins,

--is an easy and natural transition." These two passages seem to me irreconcileable.
  He continues as follows : " Simple as these acts are, they involve both physical
and mental powers which are capable of all the developments which we see in the

most advanced industrial arts. These acts involve the instinctive idea of the con-

stancy of natural causes and the capacity of thought, which gives men the convic-
tion that what has happened under given conditions will, under the same con-

ditions, always occur again." Certainly I should never have supposed that any

one who had studied the lower races of men would have considered that when
one savage knocked another down he therebj- demonstrated his appreciation " of

the constancy of natural causes," or gave any evidence of "capacity for thought."

   The Duke blames the Ai-chbishop of Dublin for not having defined the terms
"civilization" and "barbarism." It seems to me that Whately illustrated his
meaning better by examples than he could have done by any definition. The

Duke does not appear to have felt any practical dirticulty from the omission ; and it

is remarkable that after all he himself omits to define the terms, thus being him-
self guilty of the very fault for which he blames Whately. In truth it would

be impossible in a few words to define the complex organization which we call
civilization, or to state in a few words how a ci^dlized differs from a barbarous
people. On the other hand, to define civilization as it should be, is surely as yet
impossible, since we are far indeed from having solved the problem, how we may

best avail ourselves of our opportunities, and enjoy the beautiful world in which

we live.

that there is no necessary connexion between a state of mere childhood in respect
to knowledge and a state of utter barbarism, words which, if they have any de-

finite meaning at all, imply the lowest moral as well as the lowest intellectual

condition." To every proposition in this remarkable sentence I entirely demur.

There is, I think, a very intimate connexion between knowledge and civilization.
Knowledge and barbarism cannot coexist, knowledge and civilization are in-

separable.

   Again, the words " utter barbarism " have certainly a very definite signification,
but as certainly, I think, not that which the Duke attributes to them. The

lowest moral aud the lowest intellectual condition are not only, in my opinion, not

inseparable, they are not even compatible. Morality implies responsibility, and

consequently intelligence ; the lower animals are neither moral nor immoral ; the

lower races of men may be, and are, vicious ; but allowances must be made for
them ; on the contrary {corruptio optimi pessima est), the higher the mental power,

the more splendid the intellectual endowment, the deeper is the moral degradation

of him who wastes the one and abuses the other.
   Travellers who have lived much among savages differ greatly from the Duke in

his estimate of their moral condition. Thus, Mr. Wallace, our latest and one of
our best travellers, says*, " I have lived with communities of savages in South

America and in the East, who have no laws or law courts but the public opinion
of the villagers freely expressed. Each man scrupulously respects the rights of

his fellow, and anj^ infraction of those rights rarely or never takes place. In such

a community all are nearly equal ; there are none of those wide distinctions of
education and ignorance, wealth and poverty, master and servant, which are the

product of our civilization ; there is none of those widespread division of labour

which, while it increases wealth, produces also conflicting interests ; there is not
that severe competition aud struggle for existence or for wealth which the dense

population of civilized countries inevitably creates. All incitements to great

crimes are thus wanting, and petty ones are thus repressed, partly by the influence

of public opinion, but chiefly b}" that natural sense of justice and of his neigh-

bour's right, which seems to be in some degree inherent in every race of man.
Now, although we have progressed vastly beyond the savage state in intellectual
achievements, we have not advanced equally in morals."

 --As regards the Bushmen, Le Vaillant saj's : " For myself, who, far from fearing

the Houzouanas, had felt pleasure from their society, and entertained an affection

for them, I once more confess that I did not part from them without regret ; that

I found them an active, laborious, and intelligent race of men, ever ready to oblige

in spite of obstacles, and superior to other savages both in courage and ability . .
                                              They inspired me," he adds, " with more love and

esteem than any other tribe in Africa; with whom I woidd have undertaken,

without fear, to traverse the whole of that quarter of the globe had my good

innocent, and yet more criminal than civilized races ; thej are by no means in the

lowest possible moral condition, nor do they rise to the higher virtues.

  In my previous paper I laid much stress on the fact that even in the most civi-

lized nations we iind traces of early barbarism. The Duke maintains, on the con-

trary, that these traces afford no proof, or even presumption, that barbarism was

the primeval condition of man ; he urges that all such customs may have been,

--not primeval, but medieval ; and he continues " Yet this assumption runs

through all Sir J. Lubbock's arguments. Wherever a brutal or savage custom

prevails, it is regarded as a sample of the original condition of mankind. And
this in the teeth of facts which prove that many of such customs not only may

have been, but must have been, the result of corruption."

   Fortunately, it is unnecessary for me to defend myself against this criticism,
because in the very next sentence the Duke directly contradicts himself, and shows

--that I have not done that of which he accuses me. He continues his argument

thus : " Take cannibalism as one of these. Sir J. Lubbock seems to admit that
this loathsome practice was not primeval." Thus, by way of proof that 1 regard

all brutal customs as primeval, he states, and correctly states, that I do not regard

cannibalism as primeval.

   The Duke refers particularly to the practice of Bride-catching, whieh he states

" cannot possibly have been primeval."' He omits, however, to explain why not;

and, of course, assuming the word " primeval" to cover a period of some length.

Mr. M'Lennan has, I think, brought forward strong reasons for considering

Bride-catching to have been a primeval cuistom. As the Duke correctly observes,
I laid some stress on this custom, and am sorry that his Grace here meets me with
a mere contradiction, instead of an argument. It may perhaps, however, be as

well to state emphatically that all brutal customs are not, in my opinion, primeval.
Human sacrifices, for instance, were, I think, certainly not so.

  My argument, however, was that there is a definite sequence of habits and ideas

that certain customs (some brutal, others not so) which we find lingering on in

civilized communities, are a page of past history, and tell a tale of former bar-

barism, rather on account of theii- simplicity than of their brutality, though many

of them are brutal enough.

  No one surely would go back from letter-writing to the use of the quippu or

hieroglyphics ; no one would abandon the fire-drill and obtain fire by hand-

tricrion.

   Believing that the primitive condition of man was one of civilization, the
Duke accounts for the existence of savages by the remark that they are " mere
outcasts of the human race," descendants of weak tribes which were " driven to
the woods and rocks." But until the historical period these "mere outcasts"

occupied almost the whole of North and South America, all Northern Europe, the

greater part of Africa, the great continent of Australia, a large part of Asia, and

the beautiful islands of the Pacific. Moreover, until modified by man the great

continents were either in the condition of open plains, such as heaths, downs,

prairies, and tundras, or they were mere " woods and rocks." Now everything

tends to show that mere woods and rocks exercised on the whole a favourable

influence. Inhabitants of great plains rarely rose beyond the pastoral stage.
In America the most advanced civilization was attained, not by the occupants of

the fertile valleys, not along the banks of the Mississippi or the Amazon, but
among the rocks and the woods of Mexico and Peru.

Scotland itself is a brilliant proof that woods and rocks are compatible with a

Myhigh state of ci\"ilization.  idea of the manner in which, and the causes owing

to which, man spread over the earth, is very diflerent from that of the Duke. He

evidently supposes that new countries have been occupied by weaker races, driven

there by more powerful tribes. This I believe to be an entirely erroneous notion.

WeTake for instance our own island.  are sometimes told that the Celts were

driven by the Saxons into Wales and Cornwall. On the contrary, however, we

know that Wales and Cornwall were both occupied long before the Saxons landed

on our shores. The Celts were not driven away at all, but either destroyed or

absorbed.

force acting on any given race from without, but by internal necessity, and the

pressure of population ; by peaceful, not by hostile force ; by prosperity, not by

misfortune. I believe that of old, as now, founders of new colonies were men of

energy and enterprise ; animated by hope and courage, not by fear and despair

that they were, in short, anything but mere outcasts of the human race.

The Duke relies a good deal on the case of America. " Is it not true," he asks,

" that the lowest and rudest tribes in the population of the globe have been found

at the furthest extremities of its great continents, and in the distant islands which

would be the last refuge of the victims of violence and misfortune ? ' The New

World ' is the continent which presents the most uninterrupted stretch of habitable

land from the highest northern to the lowest southern latitude. On the extreme

north we have the Esquimaux, or Inuit race, maintaining human life under

conditions of extreniest hardship, even amid the perpetual ice of the Polar Seas.

And what a life it is ! Watching at the blow-hole of a seal for many hours, in a

temperature of 75° below freezing-point, is the constant work of the Inuit hunter.

And when at last his prey is struck, it is his luxury to feast upon the raw blood
and blubber. To civilized man it is hardly possible to conceive a life so wretched,

and in many respects so brutal as the life" led by this race during the long lasting

night of the arctic winter."

To this question I confidently reply. No, it is not true ; it is not true as a general

proposition that the lowest races are found furthest from the centres of continents

it is not true in the particular case of America. The natives of Brazil, possessing

a country of almost unrivalled fertility, surrounded by the most luxuriant vegeta-

tion, watered by magnificent rivers, and abounding in animal life, were yet

unquestionably lower than the Esquimaux *, whom the Duke pities and despises so

" When we rise," says Mr. Ilillf, " twice or thrice a day from a fuU meal, we

cannot be in a right frame either of body or mind for the proper enjoyments of the

chase. Our sluggish .spirits then wants the true incentive to action, "which should

be hunger, with the hope before us of filling a craving stomach. I coidd remem-

a touch of the charm of a savage life (for every condition of humanity has its good

as well as its evil), but never till now did I "fully comprehend the attachment of

the sensitive, not drowsy Indian."

   Esquimaux life, indeed, as painted by our Arctic voyagers, is by no means so
miserable as the Duke supposes. Capt. Parry, for ins"tance, gives the following

picture of an Esquimaux hut. " In the few opportunities we had in putting their
hospitality to the test we had every reason to be pleased with them. Both as to

food and accommodation, the best they had were always at our service ; and their
attention, both in kind and degree, was everything that hospitality and even good

breeding could dictate. The kindly offices" of drying and mending our clothes,

cooking our provisions and thawing snow for our drink, were performed by the

women with an obliging cheerfulne.ss which we shall not easily forget, and which

demanded its due share of our admiration and esteem. While thus their guest 1

with the women working and singing, their husbands quietly mending their lines,

the children playing before the door, and the pot boiling over the blaze of a cheer-
ful lamp, one might well forget for the time that an Esquimaux hut was the scene

of this domestic   comfort and tranquillity                                                                                                               and I can safely  affirm with Cartwright

higher was the opinion I formed of them."

Tuski: " Upon reachingMooldooyah's habitation, we found Captain Moore installed

was bestowed around us with care and in quiet, and we were free to take our own

way of enjoying such unobtrusive hospitality, without a crowd of eager gazers

watching us" like lions at feed ; nor were we troubled by importunate begging, such
as detracted from the dignity of Metra's station, which was undoubtedly high in

the tribe."

   I know no sufficient reason for supposing that the Esquimaux were ever more
advanced than they are now. The Duke indeed considers that before they were
"driven by wars and migrations" (a somewhat curious expression) they "may

have been nomads living on their flocks and herds ;" and he states broadly that
" the rigours of the region they now inhabit have reduced this people to the con-
dition in which we now see them ; " a conclusion for which I know no reason,
particularly as the Tinne and other Indians living to the south of the Esquimaux

are ruder and more barbarous.

  It is my belief that the great continents were already occupied by a widespread,
though sparse population, when man was no more advanced than the lowest
savages of to-day ; and although I am far from believing that the various degrees

of civilization which now occur can be altogether accounted for by the external
circumstances as they at present exist, still these circumstances seem to me to

throw much light on the very ditierent amount of progress which has been attained

by differeut races.
   In referring to the baclvwardness of the aboriginal Australians, I had obseiTed

that New Holland contained " neither cereals nor any animals which could be

domesticated with advantnoe," upon which the Duke remarks that " Sir John

Lubbock urges in reply to Whately that the low condition of Australian savages

afibrds no proof whatever that they could not raise themselves, because the materials
of improvement are wanting in that countrv, which affords no cereals, nor animals
capable of useful domestication. But Sir J. Lubbock does not perceive that the

same argument which shows how improvement could not possibly be attained, shows
also how degradation could not possibly be avoided. If with the few resources

of the country it was impossible for savages to rise, it follows that with those

same resources it would be impossible for a half-civilized race not to fall. And as
in this case again, unless we are to suppose a separate Adam and Eve for Van

Diemen's Land, its natives must oiiginally have come from countries where both
corn and cattle were to be had, it follows that the low condition of these natives

is much more likely to have been the result of degradation than of primeval bai'-

barism."

   But my argument was that a half-civilized race would have brought other

resources with them. The dog was, I think, certainly introduced into that coimtry
by man, who would have brought with him other animals also if he had possessed
any. The same argument applies to plants ; the Polynesians carried with them
the Sweet Potato and the Yam, as well as the dog, from island to island ; and
even if the first settlers in Australia happened to have been without them, and
without the means of acquiring them, they would certainly have found some

native plants which would have been worth the trouble of cultivation, if they had

attained to the agricultural stage.

This argument applies with even more force to pottery ; if the first settlers in

Australia were acquainted with this art, I can see no reason why they should

suddenly and completely have lost it.

   The Duke, indeed, appears to maintain that though the natives of Van Diemen's
Land (whom he evidently regards as belonging to the same race as the Australians

and Polynesians, from both of which they are entirely distinct) "must originally

have come from countries where both corn and cattle were to be had," still " de-

gradation could not possibly be avoided." This seems to be the natm-al inference

from the Duke's language, and suggests a very gloomy feature for our Australian

fellow-countrymen. The position is, however, .so manifestly untenable, when once

put into plain language, that I think it unnecessary to dwell longer on this part of

the subject. Even the Duke himself will hardly maintain that om- colonists must

fall back because the natives did not improve. Yet he extends and generalizes

this argument in a subsequent paragraph, sajnng, " there is hardly a single ftict

quoted by Sir J. Lubbock in favour of his own theory, which when "viewed in con-

nexion with the same imdisputable principles, does not tell against that theory

rather than in its favour." So far from being " indisputable," the principle that
when savages remained savages, civilized settlers must descend to the same level,

appears to me entirely erroneous. On reading the above passage, however, I passed
on with much interest to see which of my facts I had so strangely misread.

The great majority of facts connected with savage life have no perceptible

bearing on the question, and I must therefore have been not only very stupid,

but also singularly unfortunate, if of all those quoted by me in support of my

argument there was " hardly a single one," which read aright was not merely

irrelevant, but actually told against me. In support of his statement the Duke

gives three illustrations, but it is remarkable that not one of these three cases was

myreferred to by me in the present discussion, or in favour of  theory. If all the

facts on which I relied told against me, it is curious that the Duke should not give

myan instance. The three illustrations which he quotes from  ' Prehistoric Times

seem to me irrelevant, but as the Duke thinks other-wise, and some may agree

with him, it will be worth while to see how he uses them, and whether they give

any real support to his argument. As already mentioned they are three in number.

" Sir J. Lubbock," he says, "reminds us that in a cave on the north-west coast,

tolerable figures of sharks, porpoises, turtles, lizards, canoes, and some quadrupeds

&c. were found, and yet that the present natives of the country where they were

found were utterly incapable of realizing the most vivid artistic representations,

and ascribe the drawings in the cave to diabolical agency."

This does not prove much, because the Australian tribes differ much in their

artistic condition ; some of them still make rude drawings like those above described.

Secondly, he says, " Sir .T. Lubbock quotes the testimony of Cook, in respect to

the Tasmanians, that they had no canoes. Yet their ancestors could not have

reached the island by walking on the sea."

This argument woidd equally prove that the kangaroos and Echidnas must have

had civiHzed ancestors; it would have been equally inipossible for "their ancestors

to have reached the island by walking on the sea." The Duke, though admittino-

the antiquity of man, does not I think appreciate the geological changes which

have taken place during the human period.

   The only other case which he quotes is that of the highland Eskimo, who had no
weapons nor any idea of war. The Duke's comment is as follows. " No wonder,

poor people ! They had been driven into regions where no stronger race coidd desire

to follow them. But that the fathers had once known what war and violence

meant, there is no more conclusive proof than the dwelling-place of their children."

   It is perhaps natural that the head of a gi-eat Highland Clan should regard with
pity a people who, having " once known what war and violence meant," have no

longer any neighbours to pillage or to fight, but a lowlauder can hardly be expected

seriously to regard such a change as one calculated to excite pity, or as any evidence

myof degradation. In  first paper I deduced an argument, the condition of religion

among the different races of man, a part of the subject which has since been

admirably dealt with by Mr. Tylor in a lecture at the Royal Institution. The use
of flint for sacrificial pur]30ses long after the introduction of metal, seemed to me a
good case of what Mr. Tylor has aptly called " Survival." So also is the method
of obtaining fire. The Brahman will not use ordinary fire for sacred purposes, he
does not even obtain a fresh spark from flint and steel, but reverts, or rather
continues the old way of obtaining it by friction with a wooden drill, one Brahman
pulling the thong backwards and forwards while another watches to catch the

sacred spark.

   I also referred to the non-existence of religion among certain savage races, and as
the Duke correctly observes, I argued that this was probably their primitive condi-
tion, because it is difficult to believe that a people which had once possessed a

religion would ever entirely lose it *.
   This argument filled the Duke with " astonishment." Surely, he says, "if there

is one fact more certain than another in respect to the nature of Man, it is that he
is capable of losing religous knowledge, of ceasing to believe in religious truth, and
of falling away from religious duty. If by ' religion ' is meant the existence merely

of some impressions of powers invisible and supernatm-al, even this, we know, can
not only be lost, but be scornfully disavowed by men who are highly civilized."

   Yet in the very same page, with that curious tendency to self-contradiction, of
which I have already given several instances, the Duke goes on to say "the most
cruel and savage customs in the world are the direct effect of its 'religions.'

And if men could drop religions when they would, or if they could even form the

wish to get rid of those which sit like a nightmare on their life, there would be

many more nations without a ' religion ' than there are found to be. But religions

can neither be put on nor cast oft' like garments, according to their utility, or ac-
cording to their beauty, or according to their power of comforting."

  With this I entirely agree. Man can no more voluntarily abandon or change

the articles of his religious creed than he can make one hair black or white, or add
one cubit to his stature. I do not deny that there may be exceptional cases of
intellectual men entirely devoid of religion ; but if the Duke means to say that
men who are highly civilized habitually or frequently lose and scornfully disavow

religion, I can only say that I should adopt such an opinion with difficulty and
regret. There is, so far as I know, no evidence on record which would justify such

an opinion, and as far as my private experience goes, I at least have met with no

such tendency.

   It is indeed true that from the times of Socrates down to those of Luther, and
perhaps later, men in advance of their age have disavowed particular religions, and
particular myths; but the Duke of Argyll would, I am sure, not confuse a desire for
reformation 'with the scornful disavowal of religion as a whole. Some philosophers
may object to prayers for rain, but thej' are foremost in denouncing the folly of
witchcraft ; they may regard matter as aboriginal, but they would never suppose

nor would any one now suppose with the South-Sea Islanders that the Peerage
were immortal, but not Commoners. If, indeed, there is " one fact more certain
than another in respect to the nature of man," I should have considered it to be

the gradual diffusion of religious light, and of nobler conceptions as to the nature

of God.
   The lowest savages have no idea of a Deity at all. Those slightly more ad-

vanced regard him as an enemy to be dreaded, but who may be resisted with a
fair prospect of success ; who may be cheated by the cunning and defied by the
strong. Thus the natives of the Nicobar islands endeavour to terrify their deity by
scarecrows, and the Negro beats his fetish if his prayers are not granted. As

tribes advance in ci^-ilization, their deities advance in dignity, but their power is
still limited ; one governs the sea, another the land ; one reigns over the plains,
another among the mountains. The most powerful are vindictive, cruel, and un-
just. They require humiliating ceremonies and bloody sacrifices. But few races

have arrived at the conception of an omnipotent and beneficent deity.

   Perhaps the lowest form of religion may be considered to be that presented by

    * It is hardly necessary to explain to anyone that I did not intend to question the

 possibility of a change in, but a total loss of religion.

the Australians, which consists of a mere unreasoning belief in the existence of

mysterious beings. The native who has in his sleep a nightmare, or a dream, does
not doubt the reality of that which passes, and as the beings by whom he is visited

in his sleep are unseen by his friends and relations, he regards them as invisible.

   In Fetichism this feeling is more methodized. The Negro, by means of witch-
craft, endeavours to make a slave of his deity. Thus Fetichism is almost the op-
posite of Religion ; it stands towards it in the same relation as Alchemy to Che-
mistry, or Astrology to Astronomy ; and shows how fundamentally our idea of a
deity differs from that which presents itself to the savage. The Negro does not

hesitate to punish a refractory fetish, and hides it in his waistcloth if he does not

wish it to know what is going on. Aladdin's lamp is, in fact, a well-known

illustration of a fetish.

  A further stage is that in which the superiority of the higher deities is more

--fully recognized. Everything is worshipped indiscriminately animals, plants, and

even inanimate objects. In endeavouring to account for the worship of animals,

we must remember that names are very frequently taken from them. The children
and followers of a man called the Bear or the Lion would make that a tribal name.
Hence the animal itself would be first respected, at last worshipped. This form of
religion can be shown to have existed, at one time or another, almost all over the

world.

   " The Totem," says Schoolcraft, " is a symbol of the name of the progenitor,

generally some quadruped, or bird, or other object in the animal kingdom, which

stands, if we may so express it, as the surname of the family. It is always some ani-

mated object, and seldom or never derived from the inanimate class of nature. Its

significant importance is derived from the fact that individuals vmhesitatingly trace

their lineage from it. By whatever names they may be called during their life-

time, it is the Totem, and not their personal name, that is recorded on the tomb or
' adjedating' that marks the place of burial. Families are thus traced when ex-

panded into bands or tribes, multiplication of which, in North America, has been

very great, and has decreased, in like ratio, the labours of the ethnologist." Tote-
mism, however, is by no means confined to America. In Central India " the

Moondah ' Enidhi,' or Oraon ' Minijrar,' or Eel tribe, will not kill or eat that fish.
The Hawk, Crow, or Heron tribes will not kill or eat those birds. Livingstone,

quoted in Latham, tells us that the subtribes of Bitshuanas (or Bechuanas) are
similarly named after certain animals, and a tribe never eats the animal from which
it is named, using the term ' ila,' hate or dread, in reference to killing it "*.

Traces, indeed, of Totemisra, more or less distinct, are widely distributed, and

often connected with marriage prohibitions.

   As regards inanimate objects, we must remember that the savage accounts for all
action and movement by life ; hence a watch is to him alive. This being taken

in conjunction with the feeling that anything unusual is " great medicine," leads

to the worship of any remarkable inanimate object. Mr. Fergusson has recently

attempted to show the special prevalence of Tree and Serpent worship. He might,
I believe, have made out as strong a case for some other objects. It seems clear

that the objects worshipped in this stage are neither to be regarded as emblems,

nor are they personified. Inanimate objects have spirits as well as men; hence
when the wives and slaves are sacrificed, the weapons also are broken in the grave,
so that the spirits of the latter, as well as of the former, may accompany their

master to the other world.

The gradually increasing power of chiefs and priests led to Anthropomorphism

with its sacrifices, temples, and priests, &c. To this stage belongs idolatry, which

must by no means be regarded as the lowest state of religion. Solomont, indeed,

long ago pointed out how it was connected with monarchical power :

  Whom" men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took

the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king, whom

they honoured, to the end that by this, their forwardness, they might flatter him
that was absent, as if he were present.

    '' Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant
to more superstition.

   " For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to
make the resemblance of the best fashion.

   " And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a

God, which a little before was but honoured as a man.'
   The worship of principles may be regarded as a still further stage in the natural

development of religion.

It is important to observe that each stage of religion is superimposed on the

preceding, and that bygone beliefs linger on among the children and the ignorant.
Thus witchcraft is still believed in by the ignorant, and fairy tales flourish in the

nursery.

  It certainly appears to me that the gradual development of religious ideas among
the lower races of men is a fair argument in opposition to the view that savages

are degenerate descendants of civilized ancestors. Archbishop Whately would

admit the connexion between these different phases of religious belief, but I think
he would find it very difficult to show any process of natural degradation and decay
which could explain the quaint errors and opinions of the lower races of men, or to

account for the lingering belief in witchcraft, and other similar absurdities in

civilized races, excepting by some such train of reasoning as that, which I have

endeavoured to sketch.

   There is another caseiu this memoir wherein the Duke, although generally a fair

opponent, brings forward an unsupportable accusation. He criticises severely the

" Four Ages," generally admitted by archsologists, especially referring to the
terms "Palaeolithic" and " Neolithic," which are used to denote' the two earlier.

   I have no wish to take to myself in particular the blame which the Duke impar-

tially extends to archteologists in general, but having suggested the two terms in

question, I will simply place side by side the passage in which they first appeared,
and the Duke's criticism, and confidently ask whether there is any foundation for
the sweeping accusation made by the noble Duke.

The Duke says, " For here I must           My words, in proposing the terms,

port of my view. There is a considerable body of evidence tending to show that the

offspring produced by crossing different varieties tends to revert to the type from

which these varieties are descended. Thus Tegetmeier states that "a cross be-
tween two non-sitting varieties (of the common fowl) almost invariably produces a

mongrel that becomes broody, and sits with remarkable steadiness." Mr. Darwin

gives several cases in which such hybrids or mongrels are singularly wild and

imtameable, the mule being a familiar instance. Messrs. Boitard and Corbie state
that, when they crossed certain breeds of pigeons, they invariably got some young

ones coloured like the wild C. livia. Mr. Dar-svin repeated these experiments, and

found the statement fully confirmed.

So again the same is the case with fowls. Tens of thousands of the Black

Spanish and the white silk fowls might be bred without a single red feather

appearing, yet Mr. Darwin found that on crossing them he immediatelv obtained

specimens with red feathers. Similar results have been obtained with ducks,

rabbits, and cattle. Mules also have not unfrequently barred legs. It is unnecessary

to give these cases in detail, because Mr. Darwin's work on ' Animals and Plants

under Domestication' is in the hands of every naturalist.

Applying the same test to man, Mr. Darwin observes that crossed races of men

are singularly savage and degraded. " Many years ago," he says, " I was struck

by the fact that in South America men of complicated descent between Negroes,

Indians, and Spaniards seldom had, whatever the cause might be, a good expres-

sion. Livingstone remarks that ' it is unaccountable why half-castes are so much
more cruel than the Portuguese, but such is undoubtedly "the case.' An inhabitant

remarked to Livingstone, ' God made white men, and "God made black men, but
Whenthe devil made half-castes !
                                                                                                                                                   '  two races, both low in the scale, are crossed,

the progeny seems to be eminently bad. Thus the noble-hearted Humboldt, who

felt none of that prejudice against the inferior races now so current in England,

speaks in strong terms of the bad and savage disposition of Zambas, or half-castes

between Indians and Negroes, and this conclusion has been arrived at by various

observers. From these facts we may perhaps infer that the degraded state of so
many half-castes is in part due to reversion to a primitive and savage condition,

induced by the act of crossing, as to well as the unfavourable moral conditions
under which they generally exist."

I confess, however, that I am not sure how far this may not be accounted for by

the imfortunate circumstances in which half-breeds are generally placed. The

half-breeds between the Hudson's Bay Company's servants and thenative women

being well treated and looked after, appear to be a creditable and well-be-
haved race*.

I would also call particular attention to the remarkable similarity between the

mental characteristics of savages and tliose of children.

   "Tlie Abipones," says Dobritzhoffer*, "when they are unable to comprehend

anything at first sight, soon grow weary of examining it, and cry ' orqueenam ' ?
what is it after all ? Sometimes the Guaranies, when completely puzzled, knit
their brows and cry ' tupa oiquaa,' God liuows what it is. Since they possess

such small reasoning powers, and have so little inclination to exert them, it is no
wonder that they are neither able nor willing to argue one thing from another."
Richardson says of the Dogrib Indians, "that however high the reward they

expected to receive on reaching their destination, they could not be depended on

Ato carry letters.                                    slight difficulty, the prospect of a banquet on venison, or a

sudden impulse to visit some friend, were sufficient to turn them aside for an

indefinite length of time"!.

   Le Vaillant J also observes of the Namaquas, that they closely resembled chil-

dren in their great curiosity.

M. Bourien§, speaking of the wild tribes in the Malayan Peninsula, says that

an " inconstant humour, fickle and erratic, together with a mixture of fear, timidity,

and diffidence, lies at the bottom of their character, they seem always to think

that they would be better in any other place than in the one they occupy at the

time. Like children, their actions seem to be rarely guided by reflection, and they

almost always act impulsively."

The tears of the South-Sea Islanders, "like those of children, were always

ready to express any passion that was strongly excited, and, like those of children,

they also appeared to be forgotten as soon as shed"||.

At Tahiti Captain Cook mentions that Oberea, the Queen, and Tootathah, one

of the principal chiefs, amused themselves with two large dolls. D'Urville tells us

that a New Zealand chief, Tauvarya by name, " cried like a child because the

sailors spoilt his favourite cloak by powdering it with flour "^.

Williams** mentions that in Fiji not only the women, but even the men give

vent to their feelings by crying. Burton even says that among East Africans

the men cried more frequently than the women ff.
   Not only do savages closely resemble children in their general character, but a

curious similarity exists between them in many small points. For instance, the

tendency to reduplication, which is so characteristic of children, prevails remark-

ably also amongst savages.

The first 1000 words in Richardson's dictionary (down to allege), contain only

three, namely, adscititious, adventitious, agitator, and even in these it is

reduced to a minimum.                                         There is not a single word like aki alii, evening                                                                                                                                                                            ake ake,

The first 1000 words in a French dictionary I found to contain only two redu-

plications, namely, anana and assassin, both of which are derived from a lower

race, and cannot, strictly speaking, be regarded as French.

Again, 1000 German words, taking for variety the letters C and D, contain six

cases, namely, Cacadu (Cockatoo), cacao, cocon (cocoon), cocoshaum, a cocao tree,

cocos miss, cocao nut, and dagegen, of which again all but the last are foreign.

   Lastly, the first 1000 Greek words contained only two reduplications, one of
which is ajSap^apos.

savage races, and the results are given in the following Table :

in A. Goncaloes Bias's 'Diccionario da Lingua Tupy chamada lingui geral dos

Island, at Kedscar Bay, Kowrarega, and at the Louisiade, as collected by M'Gil-

Tongan Dictionary, given by Mariner, and that of New Zealand hj Bietfenbach.

The result is, that while in the four European languages we get about two

reduplications in 1000 words, in the savage ones the number varies fi'om 38 to 170,
being from 20 to SO times as many in proportion.

In the Polynesian and Fiji Islands they are particularly numerous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           thus, in

Fiji, such names as So})ioso)uo, Ruki raki, Haviravi, Lunialuma are numerous. Per-

Mmhaps the most familiar New Zealand words are meremere, patoo patoo, and

kivL So generally, however, is reduplication a characteristic of savage tongues,

that it even gave rise to the term "barbarous."

The love of pets is very strongly developed among savages. Many instances

have been given by Mr. Galton in his Memoir on the " Domestication of

Animals"*. Among minor indications may be mentioned the use of the rattle.

Originally a sacred and mysterious instrument, as it is still among some of the

Siberian Redskin and Brazilian f tribes, it has with us degenerated into a child's

toy.

Thus Dobritzhoffer tells us, the Abipones at a certain season of the year wor-

shipped the Pleiades. The ceremony consisted in a feast accompanied with dan-

cing and music, accompanied with praises of the stars, during which the principal

priestess, "who conducts the festive ceremonies, dances at intervals, rattling a

gourd full of hardish fruit-seeds to musical time, and whirling round to the right

with one foot, and to the left with another, without ever removing from one

spot, or in the least varying her motions''^.

 --Spix and Martius§ thus describes a Coroado chief: " In the middle of the as-

semblj', and nearest to the pot, stood the chief, who, by his strength, cunning, and

courage, had obtained some command over them, and had received from Marlier

the title of Captain. In his right hand he held the maraca, the above-men-

tioned Castanet, which they call gringerina, and rattled with it, beating time with

his right foot."

" The Congo Negroes had a great wooden rattle, upon which they took their

oaths"||.

The rattle also is very important among the Indians of North America^. When

any person is sick, the sorcerer or medicine man brings his sacred rattle and shakes

it over him. This, says Prescott, " is the principal catholicon for all diseases."

Catlin** also describes the "rattle "as being of great importance. Some tribes

have a sacred drum, closely resembling that of the Lappsft. When an Indian is

ill, the magician, says Carver J J, " sits by the patient day and night, rattling in his

ears a gourd-shell filled with dried beans, called a chiehicone." Klemm§§ also

remarks on the great importance attached to the rattle throughout America, and

Staad even thought that it was worshipped as a divinity ||||. Schoolcraft ^51 also
gives a figure of Oshkabaiwis, the Redskin medical chief, " holding in his hand the

magic rattle," whicli is indeed the usual emblem of authority in the American
pictographs. I know no case of a savage infant using the rattle as a plaything.

   Tossing halfpence, as dice, again, which used to be a sacred and solemn mode of
consulting the oracles, is now a mere game for children.

   So again the doll is a hybrid between the baby and the fetish, and exhibiting
the contradictory characters of its parents, becomes singularly unintelligible to

grown-up people.
   Mr. Tylor has pointed out other illustrations of this argument, and I would

refer those who feel interested in this part of the subject to his excellent works.
   Dancing is another case in point. With us it is a mere amusement. Among

savages it is an important and, in some cases, religious ceremony. " If," says
Robertson*, "any intercourse be necessary between two American tribes, the ambas-

sadors of the one approach in a solemn dance, and present the calumet or emblem, of
peace; the sachems of the other receive it with the same ceremony. If war is
denounced against an enemy, it is by a dance, expressive of the resentment which
they feel, and of the vengeance which they meditate. If the wrath of their gods

is to be appeased, or their beneficence to be celebrated, if they rejoice at the birth

of a child, or mourn the death of a friend, they have dances appropriated to each of
these situations, and suited to the different sentiments with which they are then

animated. If a person is indisposed, a dance is prescribed as the most effectual

means of restoring  him  to  health                                  and if  he  himself cannot endure the fatigue of
                                                                  ;

such an exercise, the physician or conjuror performs it in his name, as if the vii-tue

of his activity could be transferred to his patient."

   But it is unnecessary to multiply illustrations. Every one who has read much

on the subject wiU admit the remarkable similarity which 'exists between savages
and children. It explains the capricious treatment which so many white men have

received from savage potentates ; how they have been alternately petted and

illtreated, at one time loaded with the best of everything, at another neglected

or put to death.

This close resemblance existing in ideas, language, habits, and chai-acter between

savages and children, though generally admitted, has usually been disposed of in
a passing sentence, and regarded rather as a curious accident than as an impor-
tant truth. Yet from several points of view it possesses a high interest. Better

understood, it might have saved us many national misfortunes, from the loss of
Captain Cook down to the Abyssinian war. It has also a direct bearing on the

present discussion.

   The opinion is rapidly gaining ground among naturalists, that the development

of the individual is an epitome of that of the species, a conclusion which, if fully

borne out, will evidently prove most instructive. Already many facts are on record

which render it, to say the least, highly probable.

   Birds of the same genus, or of closely allied genera, which, when mature, differ
much in colour, are often very similar when young. The yoimg of the Lion and
the Puma are often striped, and fcetal whales have teeth.

   Leidy has shovra that the milk-teeth of the genus Equus resemble the perma-

nent teeth of Anchifherium, while the milk-teeth of Anchithcritim again approxi-

mate to the dental system of Meri/chippus^ . Rutimeyer, while calling attention

to this interesting observation, adds that the milk-teeth of Eqims cahallus in the
same way, and still more those of E. fossilis, resemble the permanent teeth of

Hippariun J.

   Agassiz, according to Darwin, regards it as a "law of nature," that the young
states of each species and group resembles older forms of the same group ; and
Darwin himself says § , that "in two or more grotips of animals, however much
they may at first differ from each other in structure and habits, if they pass
through closely similar embryonic stages, we may feel almost assured that they
have descended from the same parent form, and are therefore closely related."

 space of time, a series of changes whicli, when supposed to occupy a period inde-
 finitely great, and to go on in various ways instead of one way, give us a tolerably

 clear conception of organic evolution in general."

    It may be said that this argument involves the acceptance of the Darwinian

 hypothesis ; this would, however, be a mistake ; the objection might indeed be

 tenable if men belonged to different species, but it cannot fairly be urged by those
who regard all mankind as descended from common ancestors ; and, in fact, it is

strongly held by Agassiz, one of Darwin's most uncompromising opponents.
    Regarded from this point of view, the similarity existing between savages and

childi-en assumes a singular importance, and becomes almost conclusive as regards

the question now at issue.
   The Duke ends his work with the expression of a belief that man, " even in his

most civilized condition, is capable of degradation, that his knowledge may decay,
and that his religion may be lost." Far more noble, as it seems to me, are the

--concluding passages of Lord Dunraven's opening address to the Cambrian Archseo-

logical Association, " that if we look back through the entire period of the past
history of man, as exhibited in the result of archffiological investigation, we can

scarcely fail to perceive that the whole exhibits one gTand scheme of progression,

which, notwithstanding partial periods of decline, has for its end the ever-increas-

ing civilization of man, and the gradual development of his higher faciUties, and

for its object the continual manipulation of the design, the power, the wisdom,
and the goodness of Almighty God."

  I confess therefore that, after giving the arguments of the Duke of Argyll my

most attentive and candid consideration, I see no reason to adopt his melancholy

conclusion, but I remain persuaded that the past history of man has, on the whole,
been one of progress, and that, in looking forward to the future, we are justified

in doing so with confidence and with hope.

   The object of the paper was to show, by various experiments with the tissue,
seeds, and pollen of plants, that the germs of the Infusoria, supposed bj' hetero-

genists to be spontaneously generated in infusions of organic substances, are pre-
sent in these substances before infusion. These experiments .show also that Infu-

soria are developed fi-om the fungus which is produced from milk-globules placed
in water, as also from the contents of the pollen-cell, proving that decomposition
is not necessary to such development. The conclusion enunciated in the paper
is that infusorial germs are essential to the development of all plants, and that the
final product of these germs, whether it shall be animal or vegetable, depends on
the conditions under which they are brought to matmity.

Address hy Sir Bartle Feeee, President of the Section.

In opening the proceedings of this Section I have no intention to attempt any sys-

tematic summary of the progress, present state, or prospects of geographical science

generally. Such an effort would be impertinent in the presence of some of the

great geographers whom we see around us; and considering that the comprehen-

sive and exhaustive annual address of Sir Roderick Murchison for the past year is

in the hands of so many of our members and visitors, it would be supertiuous were

I to essay even a sketch of the progress of geographical science since the British

Association last met at Norwich.

  My object will be simply to state the proposed course of our proceedings in this

Section of the Association, and to inform j-ou very briefly, and by way of intro-

duction only, on what particular points we may expect to hear from the ^lembers
or from visitors who honour us with their presence, information which may be

either new in itself or may form the basis of useful discussion by those present,

whether tliey come in the character of masters or disciples of the science.

Polar discovery seems, by universal consent, to have a sort of precedence in all

classification of recent geographical inquiry, and in this branch we cannot expect

much that is new to be laid before our present fleeting.

  We are now in the midst of the vei-y brief season during which an Arctic

summer allows the navigator, for a few weelvs only, any chance of making fresh

discoveries, and we cannot, for some time longer, hear what measure of success may

have attended attempts like that of Mr. Lamont, to extend our knowledge of the

regions adjacent to the North Pole, and especially to solve the present great Arctic

problem as to the existence of an open Polar basin. "\Ve must not expect too

much. The point has been passed at which skill and well-directed energy could

command important results in the way of discoveries in those seas. Each fresh

addition to our knowledge of the distribution of land and water in those ice-bound

regions has generally left the difficulties of further discovery greater than before

and while the precautions to be taken, and the energy to be applied must be quite

as great as in the days of Baffin or Parry, the results must depend more than ever

on a favourable season, a lucky lane in the ice, or on what a sportsman would call

a judicious cast in critical cases of doubt.

  We may, however, hope to hear something of interest to geographers with

regard to the prospects of Antarctic discovery in connexion with the preparations

for observing the coming transit of Venus.

Geographers and astronomers will sympathize less than other taxpayers with

the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he finds even the heavenly bodies moving

Wefor a parliamentary grant.  may wonder, with l\Ir. Lowe, that Venus cannot

arrange a transit without an application to the British Treasury ; but we may
hope that Parliament, when the application does come before them, will not

be less liberal than they were; exactly a century ago (in the days of Cook), and

Wethat they will regard the investigation as one of really national importance.

may further trust that there will not be wanting a Hooker or a Darwin to record

the discoveries of our philosophers in the Antarctic regions. They will be most

important in a scientific point of view, even though they may lack the novelty and

thrilling incidents which make the voyages of the ' Erebus ' and ' Terror ' almost

as exciting as the most sensational of modern works of fiction.

  Directly we leave the immediate neighbom-hood of the Polar seas we come to

regions where the restless activity of geographical discoverers is at work filling up
Wethe vast spaces of terra incognita which still exist on oiu- best maps.
                                                                           may

not this year hope to hear statements of such importance as at former Meetings,

when Livingstone, Speke, Baker, or Palgrave enchained the attention of the Asso-

ciation with their narratives of their then recent discoveries. Still I believe there

are gentlemen present who will satisfy you that the spirit of research is not less

active now than in former years, and that every season brings additions to our

stock of geographical knowledge which, in the aggregate, are of vast importance._

   There are amongst us, I am glad to hear, more than one geographer who will
represent that vast Russian Empire, whose territories extend in so many directions

into regions comparatively unknown, and whose Government has long been so

honourably distinguished "by the aid it has aftbrded to geographical science. It

may I believe be truly said "that along the line of thousands of leagues which form

the' southern boundary of the Russian Empire in Asia, there are scarcely a hundred

miles regarding which our knowledge is as complete as could be desired ; and

almost eveiy Government official employed on the frontier, and every trader who

crosses it, has the means of adding important information to our stock of ascer-

tained geographical facts.

An increasing share of public attention has of late been directed to those regions

where the southern frontier line of the Russian Empire approaches the northern

limits of our own Indian Empire.

The vast space which intervenes between our two empires, differing, as it does,

so widely, both in physical aspect and in political condition, from these ocean-

washed shores of Europe, is a region not unblessed by nature. History assures us

that it is little changed in anything, save in political condition, since it was a

nursery of great nations, and the cradle, not only of kings and founders of empires,

but of trains of thought and of vast systems of moral and political philosophy

which have overspread and largely influenced the richer regions of the south and

west. What has inflicted on countries once so famous such a curse that the soli-

tary traveller who passes through them, as Vambery did, in disguise, is welcomed
among us as one just escaped from almost certain death, who has during his

whole sojourn carried his life in his hand ? Surely we must rejoice that the

thoughts of two gTeat civilized neighbouring nations are at length earnestly

directed to this vast region that we no longer regard our neighbours to the north
                                                                                                                                                   ;

and west of our Indian frontier with studied aversion and distrust, as nations of

born men-stealers and man-slayeis, all intercourse with whom must be discouraged

and prohibited as the only condition on which we can hope to avoid being drawn

into desolating wars or embarrassing political alliances.

I believe that nothing but good can result from the attention of the great states-

men of Russia and of England being directed to the condition of the countries

which inters'ene between our empires in Asia. As far as we are ourselves con-

cerned, I feel sure that the cause of peace and good neighbourhood could not be in

better hands than those of the able and enlightened nobleman who now rules over

India as Viceroy ; and geographers may, I think, rest assured that it will not be

Lord Mayo's fault if he fails to secure that condition of permanent good neigh-

bourhood which both empires most earnestly desire. It is the best guarantee for

progress in geographical science as in aU those other branches of knowledge and

civilization which flourish best in peace, and languish, or maintain but a fevered

existence, in time of war or political disturbance.

AVe shall have among us Mr. Douglas Forsyth, honourably distinguished among

those who, like Capt. Montgomery and his fellow-labourers, have led the way in

geographical discovery to the north of India, and contributed to lift the veil which

has for so many generations separated the inhabitants of Tartary and Thibet from
those of India. He will give you, I hope, much interesting information regard-

ing the trade-routes towards Thibet and Eastern Chinese Tartary, and will satisfy

you that he is actuated by no motive more dangerous to us or our neighbours

than a sincere desire to extend the peaceful domain of commerce, and, as a hand-

maid thereto, to aid the cause of geographical discovery.

  He will tell you how much has been accomplished since Humboldt, but a few

years ago, pointed to a correct knowledge of those regions as among the great
--154 REPORT 1869.

desiderata of geographical science. He will give you the latest intelligence of those
enterprising travellers, Messrs. Shaw and Hayward, the former of whom is at

Yarkaud, well treated, and apparently a special favourite with both rulers and

people. Times are indeed changed since Adolphe Schlagintweit, only a few years

ago, became a martyr to his zeal for science, and was put to death at Kashgar,

almost all his valuable papers and observations being, it is to be feared, irre-

trievably lost.

Mr. Trelawney Saunders will read a paper in which he has combined some of the

latest information acquired by Capt. Montgomery, and his intelligent and enter-

prising assistants, the Pundits, and applied it to illustrate the general geography

of the Himalayan range. Much as has been written about that vast chain, it can

hardly be said that even professed geographers have any adequate conception of

the bulk and importance of that great mountain-mass. Its length may be said to

be still almost a matter of conjecture, for its eastern and western terminations

have both still to be defined. Its breadth, as Capt. Montgomery, who may be said

hrst to have spanned it, tells us is more than 400 miles at its narrowest, or about

eight times the average width of the Alps, with a summit-ridge the passes over

which average about 15,000 feet in height. Probably many scores of peaks may

be enumerated higher than Mont Blanc. Considering how long it has taken

geogi-aphers in Europe to trace out the yet unexhausted wonders of our own

Alpine ranges, it is clear that the Himalayan range and its offshoots may afford

ample ground for the most energetic of explorers for many generations to come.
   I trust some of our visitors may be able to give us late and detailed accounts of

what Mr. Cooper has done and proposes to do towards exploring the almost un-

known region which he has already so vigorouslj' attaciied from various directions.

Though he has not hitherto succeeded in traversing the inhospitable countries

between Bengal and China, the energy and judgment with which he has repeated

and varied his efforts must, sooner or later, lead to important discoveries ; and I

trust that liis repeated disappointments may find compensation in the ultimate

solution of what may be regarded at present as the great geographical problem of

that part of Asia.

The Association will recollect that the latest intelligence regarding the course

of the Sanpoo, the great river which runs so far from W. to E. in a course nearly

parallel to the general direction of the main Himalayan range, has revived a former

discussion as to whether that river is the* upper stream of the Barrumpootra or of

the Irrawaddy. The supposition that it was identical with the Irrawaddy has

long been considered as set at rest, and some of our best authorities, such as Drs.

Hooker, Thomson, and Campbell, would, I believe, scout the notion that there was

any present doubt on the subject. Still it is certain that some Chinese and

Thibetan informants have assured later travellers that the Sanpoo is the upper

stream of the Irrawaddy, and we are almost destitute of any accurate data regard-

ing the course of the Barrumpootra much higher tip than Sudiya. It is clear,

then, that there is need of fm-ther inquiry before the question can be said to be

finally set at rest, and the little we know of the rivers further down, between Burma

and China, tends to show that it would be unsafe to dogmatize too confidentlv as

to the impossibility of any theory, however improbable it tx^&j prima facie appear

to be.

Thus, unless there be a misprint in the published accounts of Capt. Sladen's

expedition, he ascertained Mourein, one of the furthest points reached near the

Bm-mese and Chinese frontier, to be 8000 feet above the sea, an elevation hitherto,

I believe, quite unsuspected. It is true that the somewhat doubtful course of the

four great rivers, the Irrawaddy, the Salween, Cambogia Kiver, and the Yang-

tse-Kiang, which are represented on our latest maps as running for so many

hundred miles, in courses nearly parallel, and frequently less than sixty miles apart,

would indicate streams flowing in deep gorges, like the upper course of many

of the rivers which have their source in the Himalaya, separated probably by

very lofty mountain-ranges ; but hitherto the data for mapping out the course of

Wethese rivers have been little better than conjectural.  may hope that future

attempts to penetrate in this direction from Burma wiU meet with better success

than that of Capt, Sladen, who has, however, brought back information of con-

   siderable value, and may aid future explorers to renew their attempts, -witli better

   prospect of a complete and successful result.

      The glory of being the first in modern days actually to traverse the almost un-
   known region between the Indo-Chinese races and China proper, has been re-

   served for our neighbours the French. The Fellows of the (Geographical Society

   will recollect the admirable summarj- of the residtsof the great French expedition,

   which was given by the President in his last Anniversary Address, wherein Sir

   Roderick Mm-chison described the general course of a journey almost unparalleled

   --in modern days a journey of 6200 miles from the tidal waters of the Cambogia
   --River to Shanghai, 2-480 miles of the distance having been traversed on foot the

   whole distance, with very few exceptions, being almost entirely new to modern

   European travellers.

   I am not sure whether we are likely to hear from any of our visitors any details

   of this expedition beyond what has been already published in the French geogra-

   phical periodicals; but we cannot doubt that whenever the scientific results of

   Asuch a journey are published, they will prove of surpassing interest.  country

   so rich and varied in soil, with a rainfiiU probably, in parts, exceeding that of

   almost any known portion of the globe, and a great variety of temperature, which

   has been hitherto almost cut off from civilized Europe, while it approximates geo-

   graphically to some of the most interesting regions of India and the Eastern Archi-

   pelago, must possess a founa and flora of gi-eat novelty and interest.

   Is or can it be doubted that all these attempts to traverse the regions which sepa-

   rate India from China have a political and social aspect of the highest importance.

     It is clear that the time has arrived in China when we may witness one of those

   great social movements which in all ages liave so powerfully afiected the destinies

   Aof nations, and the geographical distribution of races.  vast surplus population,

   pressed at home by over-competition in the race for life, wells over, as it were,

   and seeks in other lands the means of supporting existence which have become

   difficult of attainment in their native country. The pressure from within, in the

   case of China, has been increased by the existence of artificial barriers, in the
   shape of legislative obstacles to the free movement of the popidation, and when

   these are removed or disregarded, the human tide will pour outwards with a force

   of which emigration from Europe to our own oclonies can give us but a faint idea.

   The Chinese labourers, who meet but a doubtful welcome, or are repelled from
   Australia and America, would be hailed as benefactors much nearer their own
   homes, in almost any of the rich but thinly-inhabited countries between Assam
   and Saigoon ; and the first Chinese who succeeds in passing overland from China
   to India and back, may be the herald of an immigration calculated to change the

   face and the destiny of that vast rich, but almost uninhabited region, which has

   for so many ages proved an almost impassable barrier between India proper and

   China.

   Before turning from this part of Asia, I would remind you of a fact new, I

   beheve, in the annals of geographical discovery, and not often observable in the

   history of parliamentary interpellations, that two of the best ivsumees of the pre-

   sent state of our geographical knowledge of Central Asia and the Indo-Chinese

   frontier, are to be found in the answers given, in his place in parliament, by Mr.

   Grant Dufi", a Member of the Council of the Royal Geographical Society, to ques-

   tions addressed during the last session to him, in his capacity as Under Secretary

   of State for India.

      I may also mention, as a proof of the extent to which purely European ideas are

   penetrating to those remote regions, that I have seen a translation of a letter, ad-

   dressed by a friendly Indian potentate to the Grand Llama of Thibet, remon-

   strating with him on the illtreatment of certain Roman Catholic missionaries and

   their converts, on the gToimd that the suti'erings of the converts had formed the

   subject of comments in some of the Indian journals; and the writer of the letter

   felt assured that evil would result to bis friend the Grand Llama if he suffered

   public attention in Europe, with the ways and inhabitants of which the writer had

   intimate personal acquaintance, to be thus attracted to the inhospitable proceedings

   --of the Grand Llama's subordinates.

out revealing, as far as I am aware, a single new fact which would throw light on

the fate of Livingstone. The additional information we have received since last

the Association met, is purely negative, and adds literally nothing to what was

then laid before you in the masterly sketch of Livingstone's ascertained progress,

Wecontained in Capt. Richards's address.             still only know that up to December

14th, 1867, he was alive and well and in good spirits, at a place south-west of

Lake Tanganyika. Further than this all is coniecture. Whether we may hear of
him in the Nile Basin from Sir Samuel Baker's expedition, or on the west coast,

must for the present be pure subject of speculation. Most fervently do I join in

Sir Roderick         JNlurcLison's  hopes  that  we  may yet  welcome  him  back  among us
                  ^

during the course of the coming year. It was my privilege to see much of him in

Bombay after he had taken leave of his friends in England, and before he arrived

at Zanzibar, at the outset of his last expedition, and on this, as on former occasions,

I was at a loss which to admire most, his unconquerable courage and perseverance,

his patience and forbearance, or the grand simplicity of his character. I never me{-

a man of such lofty aims and of such genuine humility ; but what is more to tht

purpose, as a ground of our present hopes, I never met a man of such sagacity and

unfailing resources in overcoming diiRculties of every kind ; and if his health is

spared him, I feel every coniidence that he will vanquish every obstacle, and ulti-

mately succeed in whatever he may have undertaken.

There can be little doubt that great results may be looked for from the Egyptian

expedition up the Nile, under Sir Samuel Baker, which is so totally unlike in its

conception and objects anything of modern days, and for any parallel to which in

its difficulties and in the important results it may produce, we must go back to the

days of our earliest English, Spanish, and Portuguese discoverers.

I am assured that Sir Samuel's hopes point to passing next Christmas on Lake

Albert Nyanza, and if he does that he will have achieved more than, with such a

great expedition, could be expected even from his skill, energy, and enterprise.

   Mr. Blanford, who remained in Abyssinia after Lord Napier's expedition left,
writes to me that he will be present, if his brief time in England permits, and he

will doubtless have much of mterest to tell us regarding the geography as well as

the geology and natural history of those regions which he has made his special study.
   Further south we may hear something of Mr. Ersldne's explorations on the

Lower Limpopo, and in other parts of the regions adjoining the Natal colony, to

which recent rumours of gold and diamond mines discovered have attracted so
much attention. Whatever the value of these gold-fields, it is certain that geo-

graphical discovery is likely to benefit by the search ; and if, in the course of their

wanderings, the explorers should find coal-seams such as Dr. Livingstone found on

the Zambesi, the discovery may be more important to the future of that part of

Africa than if they rediscovered the Ophir of Solomon.

In West Africa Mr. W^inwood Reade, under the auspices of the Royal Geographical

Society, and Mr. A. Swanzy, one of those liberal merchants to whom geographical

discovery on that coast owes so much, is on his way to the sources of the Niger.

Mr. Stirling will give you an account of his visit to the holy city of Faz, which

has been long kept so sacred from the foot of any but Mahomedans, that 1 believe

few European travellers in modern days, except Lord St. Maur, have visited it.

  We cannot turn from Africa without a passing tribute to the great French engi-

neer who has reversed the geological revolutions of ages before the birth of history,

and restored Africa to that insular position which the vast continent probably

occupied in the geography of times preceding the early dawn of authentic history.

It is difficult to speak without exaggeration of a work which is destined to have

such important results on the commerce and intercourse of the East and West, and

M. Lesseps's great work itself may seem to belong of right to another Section of

this Association. But geographers must recollect how much of our geographical

discovery is due to the closing of this ancient route to the East. Had the action of

the Moslem powers not interfered with tJie Genoese and Venetian trade with the

East, the discoveries of Columbus and Vasco de Gama and Magellan, and even

those of Hudson, Baffin, and Frobisher, might have been delayed for generations

and now, such are the insatiable demands of commerce, no sooner has the genius

and energy of M. Lesseps removed one great barrier to this ancient trade-route,

than mercantile men turn their attention to others still shorter, and investio:ate the

long-forgotten geography of those lines by ·which the commerce of tlie Persian
Gulf and India used to reach Tyre and Palestine via Tadmor and the valleys of

the Tigris and Euphrates.

    Colonel Pelly, well remembered by geographers as a daring traveller, writes, in a

letter only j ust received, of the sudden growth of commerce which has sprung up
in the Persian Gulf Bahrein, once an important emporium of Ai-abian commerce,
has long been known to us, till within these few years, as little better than a nest
of pirates and slave-dealers ; but the chief who, till quite lately, strenuously op-

posed everything in the shape of legitimate foreign commerce, is now in treaty

with two steamer companies to visit his port regularly, and there is talk even there

of agricultural companies to cultivate the lower plains of the Euphrates vallev, and

of railways to connect the Persian Gulf with the Mediterranean.

   In South America Mr. Chandless is carrying out, single-handed, and, I believe,
entirely at his own expense, his wonderful surveys of the tributaries of the Amazon.
I trust Mr. Bates wUl give us some account of labours, with the value of which, as

well as with the difficidty attending them, no man is better acquainted than our

indefatigable Secretary.

   In North America the great Pacific Railway, which has just been opened, must
exercise a very important influence in making us better acquainted with the little-
known regions which for hundreds of miles lie on both sides of its course.

   There may be among us this day men who, within the last month, have looked

on the waters of the Pacific from the shores of British Columbia or California,
have since traversed the whole width of the American continent, and have seen,
within the space of a few days' travel, every variety of country, from the wilds of
the Eocky Moimtains and the abode of the grisly bear and the bison, to the most

civilized cities of the western world.

   From Australia we have nothing very striking to relate, though we have among
us some of the most distinguished of Australian explorers. I know of no gi-eat
expedition on foot from which we are likely to derive any sudden and important

addition to our knowledge of the vast regions still imexplored on that continent.
But the ever-active population of Australia is always at work, pushing forward
exploring expeditions on a smaller scale, and the agsrregate of their annual dis-
coveries is very considerable, often bringing to light districts of great future value

to the colonists.

   The death of the last native Tasmanian, which has been lately reported, has a
melancholy interest in the history of the geographical distribution of the human
r\ce, and I may be permitted to mention it, though ethnology has been this year

    msfeiTed to another Section.

    "·'rning from the land to the sea, we find almost every month adding to our

      vledge of the depth and conditions under which animal life is sustained in the
    at ocean-beds. The extraordinary results obtained by Dr. Carpenter and his
companions in their examination of the deep-sea soundings of our own Northern

Ocean will be fresh in the recollection of Members, and I trust we may at this

Meeting hear some of the details of their labours during the present season.
   The laying of the French electric telegraph line also, cannot fail to have fiu--

nished many new facts regarding the ocean-bed which that cable (at present, I

believe, the longest in the world; passes over; and there are other examinations of
ocean-beds in tlie eastern seas, connected with the contemplated laying of the

cable to India from Suez, which cannot fail to be new and interesting, and reo-ard-
ing which our indefatigable Member, Capt. Sherard Osborn, if he is present, would

be able to enlighten us.

    Information of this kind is likely, as ocean electric cables multiply, to increase

in value. When first such cables were laid, it was usual to select comparatively

shallow portions of the ocean-bed for the cable to traverse, and the deep ocean-
valleys and hollows were, as far as possible, avoided. But experience shows that
in the deepest water the cable is safest from injury, especially in latitudes where

there is risk of icebergs, which may ground and destroy the cable. Hence our

Electric Telegraph Cable companies are likely to become valuable allies to geogra-
phical exploration in all that relates to our deepest ocean cavities.

158 REPORT-- 1869.

Geographers are aware that from the earliest days of the Electi-ic Telegi-aph Com-

pany, the Indian records have contained a vast amount of important g-eographical

information. No one knows better than our Member, Sir Andrew Waug-h, who
was for so many years at the head of the Grand Trigonometrical Survey of India,
how valuable and accurate, how varied and extensive were the stores of informa-

tion, bearing on every portion of Indian geography, which had been accumulated

during the last two centuries of our connexion with India and China. But mo,st

of this information was very difficult of access to geographers, and they will be
glad to know that, since the last Meeting of the Association, a separate geogra-

phical department has been formed at the India Office, under the general direction

of Mr. Clements Markham, the able Hon. Secretary of the Roj^al Geographical

Society, and that an excellent map-room has been arranged and placed under the

special charge of Mr. Trelawney Saunders, so well and favourably known to all

practical geographers, while arrangements have been made for the more rapid

printing and publication in India, under the care of Cols. Thuillier and Walker, of

the Royal Engineers, of those series of maps for which, during so many years, we

have been indebted to the conscientious accuracy of Mr. Walker, who may, I
believe, now be called almost the Nestor of our English map compilers.

   As connected with this subject may be mentioned arrangements for compiling a

complete and trustworthy Gazeteer for India, and for sy.stematic ethnological in-

quiry, which has now such important bearing on political and historical geography

in India as well as in other parts of the world. I may be excused for here

dilating on a reform which is not only in itself important to geographers, but

which originated with youi- member, Sir Stafl'ord Northcote, while Secretary of

State for India.

Colonel Strange will, I hope, be able to give you some account of another reform,

which I have the authority of Sir Edward Sabine for saying is likely to have very

important bearing on the accuracy of all instrumental observations connected with

our Eastern Empire.

   Here in Devon, where so many of our great English discoverers are claimed as
among the numbers of our western wortliies, I may be excused for alluding to tlie

prizes which (at the suggestion, I believe, of Mr. Francis Galton) were oli'ered by

the Royal Geographical Society for proficiency in geography among the scholars

still in statu pwpillari. I believe the conditions of the prizes are as \et but im-

perfectly known, and we may hope that in future our great public schools will

send us more competitors in what surely ought to be considered a necessary branch

of a liberal education.

   Every practical geographer knows how trying it is to come across some un-
educated seaman, who has voyaged in regions almost unknown to civilized man,

and who, for lack of educated powers of observation, has been able to make no use

of his rare advantages. But the disappointment is a thousand times greater when
he who has missed such opportunities is a man of fortune, and, in the ordinary

sense of the word, of high education aud accomplishments. I have knovni two
instances of such men who, in pursuit of game, traversed regions of Africa abso-

lutely unknown to modern geogi-aphers ; in one case the knowledge thus acquired

was not absolutely lost, for the sportsman fortunately communicated his observa-

tions to a scientific friend, who at once recognized their value. In the other case
the sportsman could only satisfy the man of science that an imparalleled oppor-

tunity had been irretrievably lost.

   I hope, from time to time, as they come forward to address you, to have the
opportunity of introducing to you some of the eminent foreigners who have come

to England for the special purpose of being present at this Meeting of the Associa-

tion. M. Khanikof has on previous occasions attended Meetings of the British]

Association, and is already personalh^ known to many Members, and he will, 1

mirer, the President of our own Hoyal Geographical Society, and in such felicitous

terms, that I cannot do better than refer our visitors and members to what Sir

Roderick Murchison says of the labours of our illustrious ^uest in his last Annual

Address. I am happy to be able to inform you that M. Tchihatchef proposes to

favour us with an address on the geography of Central Asia, and I feel assured

that the interest of the subject will render us all anxious to hear him, apart from

the privilege of discussing the subject with one who, on all topics connected with

the geography of Central Asia, is allowed by the great geographers of France and
England to be one of the highest geographical authorities of our age.

   Another equally distinguished guest is the Commaudatore Negri Christoforo,

who, as members are aware, is the President, and I beheve I may say the founder

of the Italian Geographical Society. I cannot better state to you bis claims to a

warm welcome among us than by describing him as the " Murchison of Italy."

After slumbering for ages, the spirit of geographical discovery seems once more

revived in the native land of Marco Polo and Columbus, and we mav look for the
most important results from the labours of the Society of which the Commandatore

is, at any rate, the foster parent.

I have been commissioned by Sir Roderick to state how deeply he regrets that

he has been prevented being present this day to offer to these distinguished

foreigners the expression of that hearty appreciation and welcome which would

come most fitly from the President of our Royal Geographical Society ; and you

mywill all join with me in                                                          regi-et, that our venerated friend and leader" is not here

himself to give to that welcome the personal weight which it would derive alike
from his official position and from his scientific standing among the first of living
European geographers.

Notes on a Journey in Northern Abyssinia. By W. T. Blanfoed.

Subsequently to the departure of the British troops Mr. Blanford made a journey

in Northern Abyssinia to the Anseba Valley and the Bogos Country, in company

with Mr. Werner Munzinger and two other gentlemen. The great mass of the

Abyssinian highlands, 7000 to 8000 feet in elevation, teiTuinates a little north of

the parallel of Zulla. From the northern side of the plateau two considerable

streams arise, the Anseba and the Barka, which afterwards unite and fall into the
Red Sea south of Suakin. Both are dry except in the rainy season, when they are

frequently impassable. The country drained by them is of a general level of 3000

to 6000 feet, and is inhabited by tribes of Bedawins, some of whom, the Boo-os

being the principal, still remain Christian. The party first marched due west

about thirty miles to Ailat, a village lying in a plain at the foot of the hills,

abounding in lions and leopards. From' this place they proceeded to Asus, and

thence to Kenzal and the Lebka Valley. The road, like all the passes leading to

--the Abyssinian highlands, lay up the bed of a torrent a gradual slope of 1000 feet in

twenty miles. At Kokai, some forty miles up the valley, the passage was sudden

from a perfectly desert region to hills covered with bushes and rich val^-s clothed

with fine trees                                                                     this abrupt transition was to be explained by the upper part lyinc
                                                                                 ;

within the sharply-limited area of the Abyssinian rains. At Kokai they found a
large encampment of the Az Temeriam, with immense herds of camels. These

people, and all others of the Habab and Shoho tribes, live a curious nomade life.

During the cold weather, from November to April or May, they inhabit the lowlands
near the Red Sea, which at that time, in consequence of the winter rain, aflford

pasturage for their animals. When grass and water fail here, they move with their

herds to the highlands, and remain there from June to November. The wild
elephants migrate like the people, and for the same reason. On the 13th of July
the party marched from Kokai to Bedj uk in the Anseba Valley, and remained till
the 8 th of Augus, collecting specimens of animals which exist there in great numbers
and variety. Lions were numerous and very noisy, and two specimens were
obtained of a rhinoceros, allied to the H. bicomis of South Africa. In the valley
Christian tribes live on perfectly friendly terms with others who are Mohammedans
in religion. During their stay the weather was very pleasant, always tine in the
morning, with occasional showers in the afternoon. Owing to the continuance of
the rains they were unable to return down the valley, and made a detour to the
north from Kelamet through Rairo, and thence to Ain, and across the desert by
the direct route to Massowa.

 On the Supposed Injluence of the Gulf-stream on the Climate of North- West
                        Europe. By A. G. Findlat, F.R.G.S.

   The author referred to a former communication to the British Association at
Liverpool in 185.3, where it was shown more clearly than had been before done,
that a continuous series of current-streams could be traced all over the globe, and
that by analogy these circulations extended from the surface to the bed of the
ocean, a process by which the universally uniform character of sea-water was
maintained. Our knowledge of deep-sea temperatures, and of the depth of the
ocean, was then comparatively limited, and the opinion that at tha,t time might be
entertained, that the Gulf-stream had sufficient depth and velocity to reach our
shores as a continuous stream of warm water, has been since proved to be falla-

 cious.

   First, the volume of the Gulf-stream is very much less than was formerly believed.

We have now a tolerably exact knowledge of its dimensions as derived from the sur-

veys made in the summer months between 1855 and 1866, by the officers of the U.S.
Coast Survey. The term "Gulf-stream " is here confined to the current between the
Florida Strait and the Nantucket Banks, an excellent history of which was pub-
 lished at Bremen in 1868 by M. Kohl.

    In estimating the volume of the stream theoretically we meet with a difficulty

 at the outset. It is derived from an area of not less than 5,400,000 square miles of
 the equatorial portion of the Atlantic, drifting westward at a rate of from fifteen to
 twenty-two miles per day. The whole of this tropically-heated water is apparently
 represented by the outlet of the comparatively puny Gulf-stream, not more than
 1200 teet deep and less than one sixteen-hundredth part of the breadth of its parent

 source.

   mIts dimensions in the Strait of Florida have been ascerta. medn . sections, from

 its entrance between the Dry Tortugas and the Havana, and its outlet on the Nan-ows
 off Cape Florida. In the first section (1858) it is ninety-eight miles wide, but the
 stream occupies only the southern moiety of the channel. Between the Sand Key and
 Havana (1866) the distance is 82^ miles, of which the Gulf-stream occupies only
 forty miles, and it was not more than 1200 feet deep, not reaching to the summit
 of a submarine ridge discovered here, on the summit of which the temperature
 was only 60° Fahr., while at the bottom it was only 45°. Passing over the other
 sections", that of the Narrows between Cape Florida and the Bemini Isles was chosen
 as an index of the whole. It was examined in 1855 by Commander Craven, U.S.N.,
 and proved to be the narrowest, and also the shalhiuest part of its course. The

 maximum depth is only from 300 to 370 fathoms, and the temperature at the
                                                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                   161

bottom was only 49°, so that warm water did not extend much beyond one-thii-d

of the entire depth. The Gidf-stream at its outset is then not more than 391 miles

wide, and 1200 feet deep.

The velocity has been much exaggerated. From all attainable data the author

computes the mean annual rate to be 65'4 miles per day, more in summer, less in
winter. As this rate decreases with the depth, the mean velocity of the whole

mass does not exceed 49-4 miles per day. As the sectional area of the stream is

not more than 6'64 square miles, there are not more than from 294 to 333 cubic

miles of water per day passing over a given line in the Gulf of Florida.

   From the entrance of the Gulf to the Narrows, the distance is 330 miles. To the
northward of this, it appears as the innermost of a series of warm bands, alternating

with cold ones flowing in an opposite direction, and having the cold Ai-ctic cm-rent

also flowing southwards, between the stream and the coast. In ten days it arrives

oft" Cape Hatteras, with a loss of only 3° of its initial temperature ; in tweiaty days it is

ofl" Nantucket, being 14° or 15° cooler still ; it is this rapid course and preservation
of its original warmth thus far which has made it so remarkable in all ages, but

beyond this it rapidly loses its characteristics. After fifty days it is oS" the banks of

Newfoundland, and its warmth is lowered to 51° in summer. In January it is down,

to 30°. The distance thus travelled is about 3500 miles ; its velocity is not more

than one-third of its commencement, and it has lost all the extra warmth it

possessed at the outset ; for the volume of water above 70° in the Narrows will not

form a film more than 60 feet thick ofl" Newfoundland.

The second point insisted on was that it is here more than neutralized, as a ivarm

cui-rent, by the ice-bearing Arctic current flowing southwards into its northern

edge, bringing a volume of cold water equal fully to one-half the entire stream

flowing eastward, and peneti-ating, as a cold-water gulf, shown by the isotherms,

from 150 to 200 miles southward of its general limit. It was therefore urged that

the Gulf-stream is here so thinned out and cooled down, and further neutralized
by the Ai-ctic current, that it could no longer be recognized as a heat-bearing stream,
and as such ceased to exist. The southern and warmer portion of the stream

passes onwards, also eastward, until it is finally lost on the general drifts about the

Azores.

The third point proposed was, that the warm N.E. stream flowing past the

British Isles cannot be taken as the Gulf-stream ; it has a distinct origin, and should
have a distinct designation. It is true that there is a continuous stream from

the West Indies, past the Banks of Newfoundfand, but not throughout a warm

stream                                  for the  temperature  rises  considerably,  from  20°  to  27°, to  the  eastward
                                     ;

of the Banks. How can this be the Gulf-stream ? the warmth must be derived

from more southern som'ces. The evidences of this easterly drift (the cocoa-nuts,

tropical seeds, &c.") pass onwards to the coast of Norway, to Iceland, &c. It will

take a floating body fully 150 days to reach Cornwall from the banks of

Newfoundland, and perhaps double that period to reach the North Cape or Ice-

land. The area claimed to be influenced by the stream, or raised in its tem-

perature, is fully 1,500,000 square miles to the northward of the 50° parallel.

The known bulk of the Gulf-stream proper (and it receives no accessions) wiU

only give six inches per diem over this area, and this too after an interval varying

from one to two years from the time it left the Gulf of Florida.

   The origin of the warm ocean temperatm'e in high latitudes was attributed by

the author to the prevalent S.W. winds, which, passing over a higher sea tempe-

rature, and also driving the water from that direction, brought to North-Western

Europe the climatorial attributes of much more southern regions on the eastern

side of the Atlanic, and that this N.E. current, which has only of late years been

called the Gulf-stream, should possess a specific term.

into wMch most scientific geographers had fallen, namely, that of assuming that

the mighty Himalayas presented a grand impassable bulwark, and that the moun-

tains of the Kuen Luen rose like a wall 17,000 feet high, with scarcely a crest or

depression throughout their entire extent. There were two great outlets for trade

from Northern India : one, the route of a veiy large commerce, crosses the Indus at

diflerent points between KuiTachee and Peshawur, and threading the various

passes of Bolan, Goleri, Kyber, &c., finds its way into AiFghanistan, Balkh,

Bokhara, Kokan,  and Western  Turkistan                                        the  other crosses the Himalayan passes,
                                                                            ;

and enters Eastern Turkistan or Chinese Tartaiy, a region containing several

ancient and renowned cities, such as Yarkund, Yangihissar, Khoten, &c. It was

this latter outlet which had been most studied by the author. Between the years

1750 and 186:3 the Chinese held military possession of all Eastern Turkistan ; in

the last-mentioned year the Tungani insurrection against their rule commenced,

and the Chinese were finally expelled in 1864. One of the leaders in the revolt was
Yakoob Beg, who took the Chinese fort of Kashgar, and is known by the title of

Koosh Begi, or Comm<ander-in-Chief. This man now holds the chief power in the

countiy, and is a brave, energetic, liberal-minded man, with whom and his subjects

the author contended it was for the advantage of India to establish commercial

relations. Dming the period of Chinese domination aU trade over the passes

north of Cashmere to Eastern Turkistan was extremely hazardous. The physical

difiiculties opposed to extensive communication had recently been found not so great

as was supposed. Formerly the route over the Karakorum pass was the one chiefly

used ; by this traders had to march five or six days consecutively without obtaining

one blade of grass or one atom of fuel ; but by anew route further to the east, which

the author had lately endeavoured to establish, namely, the Changchenmo, fuel

and grass eoidd be found at nearly every stage. After this route had been explored

by Mr. Johnson and Dr. Cayley, and declared by them to be perfectly practicable, it
was still difficult to induce the native traders in Cashmere to try the road. The

author, however, whilst at Ladack, succeeded in prevailing upon the Vakeel of the

Koosh Begi to return by the new route last year, and was gratified to learn that he

had accomplished the journey with the utmost ease. Since then Mr. Shaw, an

EngUsh tea-planter, had succeeded in reaching Yarkund by this I'oute. Four

passes have to be crossed between the plains of Hindostan and Leh ; but onlj

the lowest, the Rotang, is spoken of by traders with anything like fear, owing

to the severity of its ascents and to the danger fi-om sudden storms, caused by the

proximity to the monsoons of the plains. Atmospheric influences and deficiency

of fuel fOpart, there would be little physical difficulty in lading a railroad from Tso

Moreri Laie to Yarkund.

                 On the Existence of Sir Walter Raleir/h's El Dorado.

                              By Dr. C. Le Neve Foster.

   The author advanced his own experience as acquired in a recent journey to the

Caratal gold-mines of the Oiinoco, as confirming the veracity of Sir VValter Raleigh,

so coarsely impugned by the historian Hume, who says, " On his return Raleigh

published an account of the country full of the grossest and most palpable lies
that were ever attempted to be imposed on the credulity of mankind." Schom-
burgk, in defending Raleigh's statements, had, in his time, no positive evidence of
the existence of gold in Venezuelan Guiana. The gold-mines which the author
visited last year were discovered in 1849 by Dr. Louis Plassard, in the bed of the
Yuruari, near the old Spanish Mission of Tupuquen. The Yuruari falls into the
Yuruan, a tributaiy of the Cuyuni, which enters British Guiana, and eventually
pours its waters into the Essequibo. In 18-57 people began to flock to the place,
and washed for gold in the river-bed, establishing the settlement of Caratal. The
author had given the geological details of these mines in a paper recently read

before the Geological Society. He maintained that the present Caratal gold-field
was the one of which Raleigh heard such wonderful accounts. The " white spar "
in Raleigh's detailed description was imdoubtedly quartz ; for spar is the name stiU
used for quartz in Devon and Cornwall, and the author had himself seen outcrops
of lode in Caratal where gold was visible in blocks of quartz rising up fi'om the
                               a

--surface. There could be no mistake, also, in identifying the locality, " the Caroli,"

mentioned by Ealeigh as the Caroni ; for he mentions the falls, which are close to
the point where the Caroni joins the Orinoco. The other details of locality and
distance in Raleigh's accoimt were shown by the author to agree closely with the

facts that have now come to light.

     On the Munn of Cutch and the Countries between Majjoootana and JSind.
                                   By Sir Baktle Feere.

     The author stated that little had been recorded regarding this singular tract of
 country, which he had visited in the exercise of his oificial duties. It formed a

 great belt, presenting extraordinary physical features, lying between India Proper
 and the Indus. It had neither mountain-ranges nor river-systems ; nor could it be

 called a plain, for it is ridged into sand-hills ; nor desert, for it is everywhere

 inhabited, in parts supporting a considerable fixed population and numerous herds

--of cattle. The term "Pampas," or "Savannah," would imperfectly describe it.

 The length of the district, N.E. to S.W. from the point where nmnerous streams,
 descending from the lower ranges of the Himalayas, between the Sutlej and the

--Jumna, flow towards it and lose themselves in its sands, to the hills of Cutch, was

 about 600 miles, its breadth was about 150 miles ; the total area was somewhat larger

--than that of Great Britain. The north-easterly part was termed the " Thun-,"

 plain diversified by sand-hills or ridges and waves of sand, varying from 60 to 200

 feet in height, not uniform in direction and not lying in the direction of the wind.
 The appearance of this countiy was most singular, reminding the traveller of the
 ocean, with billows formed of sand. Next to this was the " Put," alluvial plains

formed of hard soil and adapted to cultivation. Throughout the "Put " could be

 seen traces of ancient canals and ruins of cities. Lastly, the portjon nearer the
Indian Ocean and separated from it by the crescent-shaped, elevated territory of
 Cutch was the " Runn." This was neither a morass nor a swamp, but a vast level
plain, with a siu-faee so firm that the feet of camels traversing it scarcely left an
imprint on the soil. Its length was about 150 miles, but if outlying areas were

included, it would be 300 miles, to the shores of the Cambay Gulf. The Runn was

nearly a dead level, rising slightly in its centre ; heavy rains covered it only transi-
ently with a thin film of water which found no drainage-outlet, but remained until
it evaporated, and became salt through the intensely saline nature of the surface.
It was totally destitute of landmarks, and travellers guided themselves only by the
stars ; and, on approaching Cutch, by a fire, kindled on the top of a hill, the lighting
and care of which was the self-imposed duty of a faqueer living near the spot. Not-
withstanding all precautions, however, travellers were sometimes lost on the plain
and perished miserably. The whole country was subject to earthquakes, most of
which were only slight vibrations, and it was to the action of these vibrations

that the author ascribed the pecidiar configuration of the country. Sometimes
small crateriform pits would be formed in the sandy soil, which subsequently became
obliterated, the sandy particles rearranging themselves and the perfectly level
surface again resumed. The more elevated district around showed evidences

--of severer shocks, and the remains of ruined cities some, as Brahminabad, beinc
--of great extent testified to their violence. To these shocks were due the

elevated ridges which constituted so singidar a feature ; these, in the opinion
of the author, being folds produced by earthquake-waves that had not again
subsided like other parts of the surface. The Rimn is periodically inundated
by the waters of the Indian Ocean, at the height of the south-west monsoon and
at high tides ; several rivers also discharge themselves into it on the eastern side,
but the water reaches the depth of only a few feet. During the dry season the eflects
of mirage were most extraordinary, the skeletons of camels perished in the traversal
presenting a deceptive resemblance to a magnificent city with its palaces and
towers. This fiequent phenomenon had given rise to a myth related by the inhabi-
tants, to the eft'ect that a pious king once obtained, as the result of his prayers, the
favour of the translation of his city to heaven, but on the discovery, after the upward
journey was commenced, of a jackass concealed in the buildings, the favom- was
revoked, and the proud city remained ever afterwards fixed in mid-heavens.

  On the best Eoute to the North Pole. By Captain R. V. HAMiiTOiir, B.N.

On the Latitude of Samarcancl. By M. Kicholas de Khanikof.

Twenty-six years ago (September 1841) the author visited Samarcand, being,

after his companion, Lehmann, the first Em-opean who had seen the famous

capital of Tamerlane since 1404, when, in the same month of September, Gonzales

Clavijo, envoy of Henry the Eighth, of Castille, entered the city. Exhausted by the

heat and covered with dust, M. de Khanikof reached the summit of an elevation, on

the road from Bokhara, where he first beheld the place he had been permitted to

visit, as member of a mining commission, invited by the Khan of Bokhara. M. de

Khanikof  was not  able himself to fix the longitude  or latitude of Samarcand                                                                                                               but
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

M. Struve, who visited Samarcand on a scientific mission in 18C8, has verified the

latitude of the city at 39° 38' 45", and the longitude 64° 38' 12" east of Paris.

ErsMne's Discovery of the Mouth of the Limpopo. By R. J. Mann.

On the Straits of Magellan and the Passages leading Northward to the Gulf
                     of Penas. By Captain R. C. Matne, E.N.

The whole distance through the Sti-aits of Magellan is about 300 miles, and the

width of the passage varies from 2 miles to 15 or 20. The eastern and western

portions are strongly contrasted in scenery and climate ; on the east we have low

prairie land, perfectly bare  of trees,  with  a  clear bright  sky,  and  hard,  fresh  wind
                                                                                                               ;

on the west rise, almost perpendicularly from the sea, lofty nioimtains clothed

vdth the evergi'een beech, which produce ton-ents of rain, varied by hail and snow

in their seasons. From the western end of the Straits is a passage leading north-

ward among numberless islands for 360 miles, and ending in the Gulf of Penas.

In this part it is scarcely too much to say that the rain never ceases for twenty-four
hours together ; the channel is much narrower than the Straits, and lofty mountains

close it in on each side, so that the sim scarcely ever penetrates into its recesses.

Diuing the recent naval survey, in which Capt. Mayne was engaged, the ship's

crew passed three months without being once able to dry their clothes, except by

the engine fires. When, however, the mists do clear away from the mountain-

tops the scenery is grand beyond description. Dreary as is this passage it is of

great commercial importance, enabling the largest steam-vessels to get northward

to finer latitudes, without encountering the high seas of the open Pacific, and to

reach Valparaiso without the strain to the ship and machinery which the outer

passage so frequently involves. Between the date when the celebrated survey of

the ' Beagle,' under Capt. FitzRoy terminated, in 1836, and the present day, a new

era has commenced in the na\dgation of the southern extremity of America. AU

vessels of war, and a great proportion of merchant vessels, are now steamers, and

the Straits of Magellan ofler immense advantages to them over the stormy passage
round Cape Horn. Many vessels which now pass into the Pacific are 300 to 400

feet long, drawing 25 or 26 feet of water : the surveys of thirty or forty years ago, "

therefore, which provided only for vessels 100 feet in length, drawing 14 or 15 feet

of water, were no longer applicable. In those days, moreover, harbours were

sought for and surveyed, into and out of which vessels could work imder sail

with the monster steamers of the present day such harbours were not requu-ed,

and the recent survey had to provide for the new conditions of navigation. In

1867 Capt. Mayne went through the Straits in H.M.S. ' Zealous,' an iron-clad of

4000 tons, and in that year thirty-eight steamers, in all, passed. At the present time

a monthly line of large steamers runs from Liveiiiool to Valparaiso by this route,

accomplishing the distance in forty-two days, or quicker than the overland route vid

Panama. The work of the Survey, which Capt. Mayne commanded, in the 'Nassau,'

commenced in December 1866, and ended May 1869. The surveying parties fre-

quently met with Patagonians in the eastern part of the Straits. They were clad

in their usual long robes of guanaco skins, which make them look so much taller

than they really are. Their chief Casimiro spoke Spanish, and at the first meeting

requested the Captain to give him two hottles of rum, not, as he explained, for

the tribe, hut as a gift from chief to chief. Capt. Mayne took the trouble to
measure several of the men ; he found one who was 6 ft. lO^ ins. high, and several

reached 6 ft. 4 ins., but the average of those met with was 5 ft. 10 ins. or 5 ft. 11 ins.,

which is some 4 or 5 inches taller than the middle height of Englishmen. The
women are nearlj' as tall in proportion. Tall as the Patagonians are, their costume

adds gi-eatly to their apparent size ; their robes of guanaco skin being as decep-

tive an addition to their stature as a woman's dress would be to a man of our
own race. Their habit of standing on the cliffs, beside their diminutive houses, to

gaze on passing ships, further explains the exaggerated accounts of the early voy-

agers. The Patagonians are entii'ely confined to the eastern portion of the Straits,

never going fm-ther west  than the  Chilian  settlement  of Pimta Arena                                                              they have
                                                                                                                                  ;

no canoes, and much dislike going ailoat. Wonderful is the difference between

them and the natives of the mountainous and wooded coimtry further west, and

even those of the eastern part of the southern islands, from whom they are sepa-

rated only by a narrow strait. These are the Fuegians ; those of this race who live

on the east being finer physically than their western relatives, probably owing to

a more abundant diet of guanaco meat ; but both sections, unlike the Patagonians,

are untrustworthy. The western Fuegians extend even up the western channels

and inhabit both sides of the Strait. They differ in almost every respect from the

Patag-onians, being usually small, badly shaped, and ugly in features but they
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

have one advantage, in their dislike of wine and spirits. Capt. Mayne often tried

them, and could never get them to taste a second time, whereas any Patagonian

would drink as much as he could get. Among the ethnological points the expe-

dition was asked to notice was, whether these people ever smiled. Not only did

they frequently smile, but they laughed outright wlienever anything amused them.

But mimicking was their peculiar /o/-/e ; they would repeat whatever was said to

them, and hum tunes after the men, though whistling rather bothered them. They

were much amused at the officers walking up and down the deck two and two,

and frequently joined hands and walked after them, looking over their shoulders

to hit the right time of turning. Sometimes their mimickiy was rather annoy-

"Whying, as when they repeated the remark,         have not these people left the

ship ?" at times when they had stayed too long aboard. The new Chilian settle-

ment in the Straits, at Pimta Ai-ena, now nimibers 800 souls, and signs of civi-

lization are rapidly rising around it. Coal having been foimd in the neighbour-

hood, it promises soon to become a coaling-station for steamers, and will take

away all trade from the Falkland Islands, which lie too far to windward of the

Straits to be of importance in the new era of navigation of the Cape, which has

now set in. During the survey, the ' Nassau ' entered a small bay in an island

called Sta. Magdalena, 12 miles from Punta Arena, which had never before been

visited. The vessel was immediately suiTounded by himdreds of seals, phmging

about the ship in the utmost astonishment at this invasion of their haunts, and

the clifts were covered with thousands of penguins, looking on in an absiu'dly sedate

manner. None of these and other animals which swarmed around the bay were

afraid of the approach of man, whom they had not yet learnt to consider as their

enemy, and the penguins in particular, when the cliffs were climbed, swarmed round

and attempted to peck the legs of their visitors.

     Account of Mr. Cooper's Attempt to reach India from Western China.

                             By Tkelawney W. Sattndees.

    In Februaiy 1868 Mr. T. T. Cooper ascended the Yang-tsze-Kiang, with the
intention of passing, if possible, through the little-known couutiy which separates

the western frontier of China Proper into British India. At Suchan, where the
river Min joins the Yang-tsze, he proceeded by the fomier river to Ching-tu, the
chief town of the province of Sze-chuen, and from thence proceeded, through
Ta-tsien and Litang, to Batang, a Chinese post on the frontiers of Sze-chuen, and

bordering on Thibet, a vast highland country, stretching along the whole of the

northern frontier of India, and subject to the imperial sway of the Chinese. From
Batang he expected to reach India either by way of Lassa, or by a direct route to
Sudiya, in the British province of Assam. Between Batang "and Assam lies a

mountainous country, not more than 200 miles in width, with villages at intervals.
The Thibetan authorities refused I\Ir. Cooper permission to proceed by way of
Lassa, or even to enter their comitry. The resolute traveller thereupon directed
his utmost eiforts to get across the short distance of 200 miles, which separated
him from Assam, but he found himself completely foiled by the vigilance of the
authorities. After waiting ten days, he was obliged to attempt theYunan route

for Burmah. He crossed on his way the Kin-char-Kiang, six miles south-west of

Batang, on the 3rd of June ; and travelling two days, came in sight of the range

of mountains forming the "boundary of the kingdom of Lassa." He was here

again stopped by a party of armed Lamas, and was obliged to turn south. In this
direction he travelled for about twelve miles, and struck the east foot of the snowy
range, forming the east bank of the Lan-tsan-Kiang. Deserted by his guides,

he lost his way, and reached the Thibetan village of Tsimg Tsar. He next cro.ssed
a pass in the snowy range, and reached the village of Tong. On the 10th of June

he arrived at Artenze, the first Chinese military station, on the borders of Yunan.

On the 12th he struck the left bank of the Lan-tsan-Kiang, and reached the vil-
lage of Coneah, the head man of which took it for gi-anted that the traveller had
come from Assam. At the Ludzu village of Wharfoopin he found the people

were chiefly Christians, connected with the Catholic mission of Succoo, distant
about eight miles, on the right bank of the Lan-tsan-Kiang. Leaving this place, in
two days he reached the residence of a Yertzu chief His nex-t stopping-place

was at the house of a Mooquor chief, who talked quite familiarly of Assam, and

showed the traveller his gold-mines and gold-washings on the banks of the Lan-

tsan-Kiang. Two days thence he arrived at the Chinese imperial city of VVussee-

foo, the General at which place gave him a pass to Talifoo ; but idtimately he was
obliged to return to "\^"esee, and thence to Permootan, in Thibet; and being again
foiled in an attempt to get to Lassa, he returned to Hankow via Kia-ting-foo, on
the Min river. Tlie author explained that Mr. Cooper in his report contributed
but little to our knowledge of the geography of the'new countiies he traversed. His
track could only be made out in a general way ; but it seems not improbable that
the place he calls Wusee might be the Chiisi of Lieut. Wilcox ; and if so, Mr.
Cooper must have reached the very threshold of British Assam without knowing
it, in a valley descending immediately into the Brahmaputra. His nan-ative,
chiefly relating to his personal adventures with the obstructive or hostile people,
seldom contains any graphic description of the country. Mr. Cooper's failure in
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                 167

his laudable purpose to initiate communication between two friendly empires of
such vast populations, was one of a series of such failures, dating from the first
quarter of the present century, when British ofiicers, having penetrated the Hima-
layas, naturally attempted to extend their explorations fm-ther into Central Asia.

From these cases it may be concluded that, if British intercourse is to be extended

from India into the Chinese Empire, it can only be done by a fresh treaty between

the two supreme governments.

Peruvian Explorations and Settlements on the Upper Amazons.

                        By Francis F. Seakle.

Yquitos, a small town on the upper part of the Amazons, or Marafion, has

recently sprung into importance as the site of a Peruvian Government station. It

is situated on the left bank of the Maranon, below its jimction with the Ucayali,

and at the mouth of a small affluent, the Itaia. The place was fixed upon in 1862,

as affording the best station for a factory and floating dock, and the steamers ' Mo-

rona ' and ' Pastaza,' of 500 tons burthen each, proceeded thither from England, in

ASeptember, to commence the works.  difficidty was encountered at the outset

by the Brazilian authorities disputing the right of foreign vessels laden with cargo

and flying the pennant of men-of-war to ascend the Amazons.  The ' Morona was
                                                                                                                                      '

fired at from the fort at Obydos, and subsequently ran aground, when all the crew

were taken prisoners ; but the right of free passage being afterwards conceded,

two more steamers were sent up in 1865, with a floating-dock, and the materials

for constructing two smaller steamers, for river exploration. The author was sent

in charge of this portion of the expedition, and stated that one of the vessels, of

750 tons burthen, safely ascended to Yquitos, a distance of 2400 miles froni the

mouth of the river. Other vessels, and numerous mechanics with machinery,

soon after arrived from England, and the settlement was soon in full working

order. The larger steamers were then used as passenger and cargo vessels,

running monthly between Tabatinga, on the Brazilian frontier, and the little town

of Yurimaguas, on the river Huallaga ; the smaller steamers, a,t the same time,

were despatched up the various tributaiy streams, most of which were hitherto

unknown, except by name, to examine their capabilities for navigation and com-

merce. One of the principal objects of tlie Peruvian Government was to ascer-

tain the practicability of navigating the Ucayali and its affluents to within a

moderate distance of Lima, and of establishing a port at some point to which a

road might be made from Lima, with a view to its becoming an outlet to the

Atlantic for the trade of the rich provinces of Central and Southern Peru. In

Sursuance of this grand idea, the ' Putomayo ' steamer was sent up the Ucayali in
  une 1866. Passing with facility up this great stream and one of its western

tributaries, the Pachitea, the expedition encountered a ferocious tribe of Indians,

called Cachibos, and two of the officers, Tabara and West, were enticed ashore

and treacherously slain. Foiled for a time in the attempt to ascend the stream,

the vessel returned to Yquitos, and a larger expedition was despatched, in Decem-

ber of the same year (1866) in three steamers. On arriving at Chunta Isla, on

the Pachitea, the scene of the treacherous onslaught of the Cachibos, a severe
Alesson was taught the savages.
                                 party of soldiers was landed in the forest, toge-

ther with a number of friendly Conibo Indians to act as guides ; and the secret

path to the hostile villages being tracked in the silence of night, the Cachibos

were surjjrised and shot down without mercy. In the centre of a viLlage was

found a kind of altar, on which human sacrifices had been offered, and one of the

·women who were captured wore a necklace of human teeth, which she stated had

belonged to one of the officers, who had been roasted and eaten. This done, the

three steamers proceeded further up the river ; the two smaller succeeded in reach-

ing the port of Mayro, the nearest practicable point to Lima, from which the Pre-

fect of Loreto and his staff" passed by land to the capital. One of the vessels

remained in the Pachitea for several months, and received on board the Hydro-

graphic Commission sent across the Andes from Lima, -who aftei-wards descended
the river, to survey the boundaries between Brazil and Peru. The same Commis-
sion also ascended the Ucayali, with the view of exploring the River Tambo, but
were not able to reach far up that river, owing to the strength of the current
being too great for the capabilities of the steamer. The Commission had arrived
at the coucliLsion that the Ucayali must be considered the iipper stream of the
Amazons, and not the upper Maranon or Tunguragua, as hitherto supposed. The
distance from the port of Mayro, to which the smaller steamers of the expedition
ascended, to the mouth of the Amazons, is about y300 miles. The present popu-

lation of Yquitos is about 1000, of whom 72 are English. The Peruvian Govern-

ment oiFered grants of land in this new and fertile country to immigrants ; and the

author concluded his paper by stating his conviction that no other tropical country

offered so healthy a climate and so many advantages to Em'opean emigrants.

                                  A Visit to the Hohj City of Fas, in Marocco. Bif J. STrRllifG.

   Fas, usnally misspelt Fez, is one of the three or four capitals of Marocco, and has
rarel}"^ been visited by Eiu'opeans. It is termed " holy " probably because it was
once a substitute for Mecca as a place of pilgrimage for the Moors, during a period

when ajoiu-ney to Arabia was rendered impracticable. The author visited the city in

the suite of Sir J. Drimimdndllay, the British Minister, on his official mission in
November 1867. It is a- fortified place, situated at the eastern extremity of a fine

plain, sloping towardslhe great and fertile valleys watered by the Sebu river, into
whose stream flow the waters of a river which passes through the centre of the

city. This river forms an interesting feature of the place, supplying, as it does,

abundant water for domestic purposes, and numerous fountains, public and private,

besides irrigating the gardens outside the walls. There were no means of ascer-

taining with accuracy the population of the city ; the author estimated it at some-
·«yhat less than 100,000. There are numerous hotels, picturesque mosques, and

Mfdresat, or colleges, the latter containing libraries and apartments for the stu-

dents                             but  the  range  of  studies  is  limited  to  the  Koran  and its commentaries,
                               ;

grammar, logic, and geometry. The official interview took place in the open court

of the palace, the Sultan mounted on a white horse, according to ancient Arabian

etiquette.

                   On Central Asia. By Pieeke be Tchihatchef.

   I beg leave to submit to your kind attention a few remarks in reference to a publi-
cation which is about to be issued, and which recommends itself by the name of the
author and the importance of its subject : I mean the intended publication of a new,
completed, and corrected edition of Baron Humboldt's 'Asie centrale,' a celebrated
work published in the year 1843, which was entirely exhausted even before the death
of the great German philosopher. This fact alone would certainly be sufficient to jus-
tify' the enterprise : but a peculiar circumstance conveys to it an additional interest and
renders it still more desirable ; it is the discovery of an autograph letter in French,
wi'itten in the year 1854, addressed by Baron Humboldt to M. Gide, his publisher

--and intimate friend, a letter which has been found among the valuable papers of

this gentleman recently deceased, and after whose death all those papers, as well
as the exclusive property of the works of Baron von Humboldt, wiitten in French
and published in Paris, have been acquired by JNI. Guerin, one of the chief and
ablest publishers in France. In this letter, which Baron von Humboldt designates

as his last will, entrusted to a dear friend ("c'est mou testament depose enti-e les
mains d'uu ami qui m'est cher ''), the illustrious philosopher enti'eats most warmly
M. Gide to xmdertake a new edition of the ' Asie centrale,' which Baron von
Humboldt declares to be the most important of all his writings ("le plus important
de tons mes ouvrages"), and .which, therefore, he wishes to be raised to the level of

the numerous discoveries made in geography, natural history, and the physical

sciences during the twentj^-six years elapsed since its publication. But, what is

still more interesting, he gives in this letter a sketch of the principal additions and

corrections his work is to receive, and among which the following desiderata play

--the chief part : a new delineation of the moimtainous ranges of Central Asia in

conformity with the numerous and important materials acquired since the year

1843, particularly in reference to the Thian-chan and to the orography of the vast
and complicated" Himalayan regions ; fmther, a summaiy of the residts of the

recent explorations of the Lac Ai-al and the Caspian Sea, of the hydrographical

system of the Jaxartes and the Oxus, of the northern extremities of the Oural

Mountains, &c. ; finally, a complete official account of the annual produce of the

amiferous deposits in Russia since the year 1854 until the present day, and a

survey of all the meteorological and magnetic observations collected during this

time in the Caucasian regions, in Siberia, and in the Turkestan. It is evident that

the additions and modifications by which Baron von Humboldt intended to com-

plete, emich, and adorn his celebrated work coidd not have been carried out with-

out the assistance of many fellow-labourers, however great may have been the

imiversal knowledge of this extraordinaiy man. No doubt, we must regi-et that

death prevented him from accomplishing a task which he seems to have considered

as the last and most brilliant crown of his long and laborious life ; but whatever may

have been the araoimt of additional gloiy it could have given him, all his disciples,

friends, and admirers are bound to consider the expression of his last and most

cherished wishes as a kind of sacred legacy imposed upon them ; and this was

precisely the feeling which decided me to yield to the sippeal M. Guerin addressed

to me, in order to work out a new edition of the ' Asie centrale ' according to the

instructions left by its illustrious author. In spite of the various occupations which

absorb myall time, particularly at the present moment, when I am preparing

myself for a new expedition in the East, I have decided to perform this rather

mydifficult task to the best of                                                                                                                                      abilities, and I hope that in the coLU-se of the next

winter the three volumes of the ' Asie centrale ' will be published, accompanied by

a fourth supplementary one, which will contain all the important additions and

modifications desired by the author, and, moreover, a new map of Central Asia,

quite difterent from that which appeared in 1843, at the end of the third volume

of the work.

Now, before I conclude this little bibliographical information, which I hope will

be received with interest by many persons who compose this distinguished assembly,

let me add that, independently of the great name of Humboldt, a special work on

Central Asia has, now-a-days, a peculiar importance and a striking opportuneness,

for it will at last dispel for ever the threatening clouds which, during so many years,

were gathering on those regions, as gloomy forebodings of a dreadful tempest. The

truth is, that as long as our knowledge oi Central Asia was scanty and vague, this

mysterious country must have appeared, not only to the ignorant crowd, but also

to many of the most enlightened and sagacious statesmen, as the natural battle-field

where, sooner or later, England and Russia had to meet in an exterminating,

dogged struggle. The danger seemed so unavoidable and so urgent that no expense

no sacrifice was spared in order to postpone this disastrous crisis. Now, thanks to
the indefatigable exertions of men like Montgomerj', Walker, Johnson, Godwin-

Austen, Schlagintweit, Sewerzow, Semenow, Baron Osten-Saken, Poltarazki, Struve,
and many other recent explorers, whose important labom-s will be thoroughly

discussed in the supplementary volume of Humboldt's ' Asie centrale,' the ominous

crisis so positively prophecied, and so unanimously feared, turns out to be nothing

more than a fantastical dream                                                                                                                                        for surely nothing could be more fantastic, nothino-
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

fitter to remind us of the stories of the thousand-and-one nights, than to see a
large army with heavy artillery, not only hover like ghosts during two or three

months amidst dense clouds and eternal snows, but even, after such laborious gj^m-
nastics, descend in the coimtryof the enemy and defeat the English troop.s, who would

be quietly and comfortably expecting the cmious visitors. Well, that is precisely the

marvellous fact which must be admitted by the advocates of a Russian invasion of

India                             for we possess now numerous trustworthy docxmients which prove most po-

Russian province, whatever may be the starting-point of a Russian army intended

to reach the Punjab, no less than two, and perhaps even three months, spent

amidst snowy, desert mountains, are required before such an army is allowed to put

their frost-bitten feet on English ten-itory. I am far from denying that among the

advocates of a Russian invasion there are men of deep science and of unques-

tionable good faith ; but they all start either from the one or from the other of these

two very arbitrary hypotheses, namely, that what has been done once may be

performed again, or what is now impossible may hereafter become possible. In

support of the first hypothesis, the numerous invasions of India ascertained by

history have been quoted ; and a learned French orientalist, M. Quatremere, en-

deavoured even to prove that the lofty mountains which form the northern boim-

dary of Cashemir, and which hitherto have been considered as not having at any

time yielded a passage to a military expedition, have been traversed more than

once, as late as in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, by considerable armies,

which, starting from Kachgar and Jarkand, reached the Punjab across Tibet and

Cashemir. But what do such facts prove ? Only one thing ; that those armies, con-

ducted by Eastern generals and directed against Eastern populations, were placed

more or less in the same conditions under which similar expeditions have been

Buccessfully performed by Alexander the Great and the Mongol conquerors, con-

ditions widely different from those which woidd be now imposed upon a Russian

or any other invading army, not only because Asiatic adventurers, as well as Mace-

donian or Roman conquerors, were not encumbered by the troublesome encum-

brances of artillery, indispensable to European troops, but also because they pos-

sessed over their enemies an overwhelming superiority either of moral or of

material strength, whereas now-a-days no invading army would enjoy this last

advantage. Even now, if an European army may succeed in dragging their ponderous

artillery over large snowy mountainous tracts, as the admirable expedition into

Abyssinia has so brilliantly proved, success is possible only under the express con-

dition  of having Abyssinians or some other Asiatic popidation to         deal with                                               for if
                                                                                                                               ;

the country, or even Magdala alone, had been occupied by French, Russian, or

Prussian troops, instead of those of Theodorus, the issue of that glorious expe-

dition might have been a most disastrous one. As for those who invoke the con-

tingencies of future times, and put an unlimited confidence in the progress of

engineering science, believing that, after all the marvels witnessed by our age,

there is no reason why the highest and the most extensive mountains of our globe,

those of Central Asia, may not be crossed by railways and pierced by tunnels, the

answer to those sanguine expectations is rather easy. Now, even granting (what

certainly is an enormous exaggeration) that there is no limit whatever to the con-

quests of man over nature, we must not forget that the most splendid triumphs of

this kind hitherto accomplished (such, for instance, as the akuost finished tunnel

and the mountain railway of Monte Cenisio, or the gigantic American railways

joining the Atlantic to the Pacific) are mere trifles in comparison with works required

for the accomplishment of similar perfomiances in the mountainous systems which

separate Turkestan from India. Indeed to launch steam-waggons along immense

vertical sui-faces, or across stupendous glaciers, or to scoop out tunnels running

many hundred miles, is now almost as impossible as to employ balloons for the per-

formance  of  such  marvellous  travels                                   and if really the time will come when
                                                                       ;

peculiar steam-engines, or rapid and manageable balloons shall be invented, no doubt

this time is so far from us that at the brilliant dawn of that glorious day the

civilizing task of England and Russia in Asia will have been fulfilled long before
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

then the now barbarous populations wiU be perfectly able to defend themselves

without wanting any tutelage, and the newly invented marvellous engines will be

used for the transport of travellers and merchandise, but not for military expe-

ditions. In one word, the more we contemplate the real state of things, such as

has been revealed to us by the recent explorations of Central Asia, the more we

must admit that the phantom of a Russian invasion in India is a worn-out bugbear

and the day may not be distant when people will smile at such prophecies, and

when the inhabitants of Bombay will be as little afraid of the appearance of

Russian soldiers as the inhabitants of London are of the arrival of French troops

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                     171

and uninvited visits. The same thing, but only in an opposite sense, may be said of

England and British India what a French poet said, speaking of honour as of a

rocky island from which one may get out hut never get in again,

" L'honneur est une ile escarpee et sans herds,

 On n'y peut plus rentrer des qu'on en est dehors."

Here, on the contrary, those who may get in will never be able to get out safely. Let

us, therefore, drop those chimerical but most dangerous illusions, which the study

of Central Asia has so happily dissipated, and let us mention another vahiable

advantage wliich such studies have bestowed upon us, showing that, if British India

is defended by an impregTiable natural bidwark, this bulwark is inaccessible only to

bloody representatives of war, but not to gentle messengers of peace ; for among
the results of recent explorations of Central Asia, one of the most remarkable and the

most satisfactory is the fact that those complicated mountainous ramifications, which

are spread, like a gigantic labyi'inth, over the whole of Central Asia, are not devoid

of numerous passes and even of considerable local depressions, in the shape of plains,

which hereafter may be very useful for the establishment of commercial communi-

cations between the remotest points of the stupendous chains of Thian-chan,

Kuenlun, Mustagh Dagh, and Himalaya. So, for instance, thanks to the important

explorations of the Kuenlun range by Mr. W. H. Johnson during the year 1866, we

know that, contrary to what has been admitted hitherto, even by Humboldt,

this lofty range does not spread itself beyond 100 miles to the east of the meridian

of Ilchi, where it is limited by long plains, through which caravans transporting

merchandise may cross the whole country between Ilchi and Leh, and consequently

almost as far as the superior valley of the Indus, only six miles distant from Leh.

A similar topographical featiu-e seems to characterize equally the vast country be-

tween Khatan and Aksu, the last city being situated on the southern slopes of the

Thian-chan range ; so that nature herself has indicated the lines which, worked out

by human art, may, in the future, connect the valley of the Indus with the Thian-

chan range, crossing in this manner from north to south a large portion of Central

Asia, and possessing the immense advantage of avoiding entirely the rugged in-

hospitable range of Kuenlun. Even the mysterious Bolor, with its cold gigantic

tableland of Pamir, seems not to be quite deprived of natural thoroughfares liable

to acquire hereafter a practical importance ; at least such a conclusion is suggested

by the map of that country constructed by Mr. Hayward, according to the itinerary

--of a merchant of Jarkand,- a map which will be replaced in a short time by a far

more accurate one, for the vast and unknown countries of the Bolor are about to

become the object of important explorations which science expects with impatience

from the accomplished geographer Colonel Walker, as well as fc-om Mr. Hayward

himself. Again, the compact network of various natural roads or paths which unite

the valley of the Indus with the range of Thian-chan is more or less connected with

other branches of natm-al communications which pen etrate across the mountains of

Turkestan and those of Southern Siberia into the hydrographical systems of the

Jaxartes, the Oxus, and Bi, as well as into the vast basin of the Balkasch Sea ; so,

for instance, there is a pass leading from Guldja to Aksu, across the Thian-chan,

and another one from the river Hi to Samarkand.

Yet all those natural thoroughfares, although even now of some importance for com-

mercial communications, cannot be of any value to military purposes, because the

various passes and depressions are interrupted by rugged mountainous masses, which

would stop or delay almost at every step  the  movement  of  an  army                         so  that  the
                                                                                           ;

necessity of performing frequent and tortuous circuits would render the march of a

Russian army, encumbered by artillery, perhaps still longer than in a straight line

across the mountains, a passage which, as we have seen, is quite out of question.

The consequence is that, at the present moment, both roads are almost equally shut

to an invading Russia. Nevertheless one may ask if those natural thoroughfares,

once developed, would not become as favourable to the transport of troops as to the

conveyance of merchandise: no doubt some facility wQidd be offered to the servants of

Mars who could be tempted to creep through the open doors of the temple of Minerva;

but is not the creation of monuments of peace the best means to render war more odious

to the populations amongwhich they have been erected, imparting to them altogether

the wish and the strength to oppose and to baffle the criminal designs of reckless in-
truders ? Therefore, instead of fearing the consequences of the development of the na-
tural thoroughfares spread out through Central Asia, it is the interest of England to

--see them established the sooner the better ; and as such a happy revolution can never

take place as long as the countries of Central Asia are not submitted to a regidar
European government, nothing can be more satisfactory for the sake of humanity in
general (but particularly for the material interests of British India) than the recent
political events which tend to convert the whole Turkestan into a Russian province,

and in this way to throw a bridge over the abyss of Central Asia, in order to unite

the valley of the Indus with the valleys of the Jaxartes and the Oxus. I dare say

that, if we consider the settlement of Russians in those remote barbarious countries
from the point of view revealed recently by science, it must be hailed by the whole

of Europe (and by England more than by any other coimtry) as one of the most im-
portant and beneficial facts of modern history, and, at the same time, as one of the
most astonishing accomplishments of long-postponed providential schemes ; for let
us not forget that the high political and commercial significance of the valley of

the Jaxartes did not escape the genius of Alexander the Great, who founded on
that river a city imder the name of Alexandria, which was perfectly known in the
time of Plinius, who mentions, "Alexandria in ultimis Sogdianorum tinibus."

Now this city, like many other creations of the great Macedonian conqueror, not

sufficiently imderstood by posterity, did never play the important part to which,
imdoubtedly, it was destined by its founder ; for the Alexandria of the iSogdiani is

nothing else than the miserable muddy Khodjeud, now in the possession of Russia,
a name as little known to the European public as it is difficult to be properly pro-

nounced by European tongues; and still it is not improbable that (thanks to its posi-
tion in the midst of Tm-kestan on the border of an important river, the classic Jaxar-

tes) the humble Khodjend may be some day raised to the rank of one of the chief
thoroughfares between Europe, Central Asia, and India : in this way the successors
of Peter the Great may become the executors of a legacy bequeathed to them by

Alexander the Great, whose mysterious testament has remained sealed up during
more than 2000 years !

   Such are the considerations naturally suggested by the wonderful recent ex-
plorations in Central Asia; and I hope they convey a sufficient idea of the high
.nterest which must inspire all enlightened persons (but particidarly English and
Russian) when they hear of the publication of a new, completed, and corrected
edition of Baron von Humboldt's ' Asie centrale.' If the diffusion of geographical

information about countries little known may in itself be considered as a service
rendered to society, what must not be the importance of such information which

relieves two powerful nations of a long-expected and seemingly quite unavoidable
struggle, and which proves once more that for the promotion of the sacred cause
of Christianity and civilization there is on our globe sufficient place for all ; and that,
moreover, England and Russia are charged by Providence to accomplish this great
task in the vast continent of Asia, where each of them has a peculiar mission,
which can only successfully be carried out if both combine in their exertions and
place their moral and material interest under the mighty safeguard of peace, mutual
sympathy, religious toleration, and justice.

Notice of a Bifurcate Stream at Glen Lednocli Head, in PerthsMre.

                       By Capt. T. P. White, E.A.

A small rivulet rises under a craggy hill which separates the drainage systems of

the Tay and Earn ; for a short distance it takes the course of a well-defined gully,
till it is met and divided into two by a slight but immediate rise in the ground,

which forms, as it were, the nan-ow end of a pear-shaped elevation. This is the

extremity of a new ridge which, starting from the Forth, carries on the main

watershed, hitherto coincident with the direction of the stream. One of the two              I

divergent waters becomes the Finglen Biu'n, descending into the valley of the Tay

the other, passing into Glen Lednoch, is a feeder of the river Earn, reunion

Abeing ultimately established in the Firth of Tay.  loop is thus formed which

insulates a large area of the county of Perth.

            ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

   Address by the Eight Honourable Sir Staffobd Northcote, Bart., C.B.,

                                D.C.L., M.P., President of the Section.

If it had not been the custom for those who occupy the position which I have

been called on to tQl to open the proceedings of the Section with some general re-

marks, I should have invited you to proceed to the consideration of the papers

which will be laid before you, without any preface. For the preface is not only

the dullest part of a work, and that which is the most fi-equently skipped ; but, as
a matter of authorship, it is the part which ought to be written last, because it

ought to be adapted to that which is to follow it ; and what that may be, I do not

yet fully know.

   Forecasting, however, as well as I can, the character of the work which now
lies before us, though not prepared as yet to present to you a summary of what you
may expect, I cannot doubt that the transactions of the present Meeting will con-

tinue to exhibit the tendency of statistical iuquuy to take year by year a wider
range. That such is its tendency is, I think, not only evident to the observer, but

may be said to be a law of the science. For the statist is not animated by a mere

spirit of curiosity, nor does he content himself with the simple accumulation of

fects. His objects are at once nobler and more practical. He aims at discoverino-

the actual condition of his country, and the causes of that condition, with a view
to discover also the methods of improving it. Now, even the true condition of the

coimtry is not immediately obvious to the superficial observer ; while the causes
of the several phenomena which it exhibits lie very deep, and can only be discerned
by the aid of patient and extensive inquiries, conducted with skill and discernment,
as well as with the most rigid exactitude ; and the investigation of the methods by

which improvements may be effected imposes a further and at least an equally
severe labour. The " Condition of England " question is one which does not lie

in a nutshell.

   I need not, I am sure, recall to the recollection of such an audience as the pre-
sent, the interesting Report presented by an eminent member of this Association*,
whom we have now the pleasiu-e of seeing amongst us, to the International Statis-
tical Congress of 18G0. You will remember how he drew attention to the two oi-eat

laws which the study of statistics reveals to us, and on which the science rests,
 the law of Stability, which teaches us to deduce from the observation of particular
phenomena general conclusions, as to the regidarity of their recun-ence ; and the
 law of Variation, which teaches us in what manner, and within what limits, the

 conditions of human life, and the cun-ent of human action, may be modified or
 controlled by man. The main interest of our studies is, of course, concentrated on

 the working of this second law, and on the discovery of the limits within which

 our power is confined, and here it is that we find the necessity for that extension

 of the range of our inqiuries to which I have adverted.

    As in the ease of most other sciences and branches of learning, so most assuredly
 in the case of Statistics, our progress is marked by a series of disappointments.

 We begin in ignorance and we phmge into error ; then we find out om- mistakes,

 and, after having fancied that we had attained to gi-eat proficiency, learn, like the
 wise man of old, that the sum of our knowledge is, that we know "nothing. From
 that point, if we are wise enough and honest enough to profit by om* experience
 we may indeed begin to make some solid progress ; "but both wisdom and honesty

 are needed for the purpose ; aye, and courage too, and self-denial. For it is no

 slight trial to a man, who with much labour and much ingenuity has collected a

 mass of materials, and has constructed a theory out of them, to find that, throuo-b
 some mistake or oversight, he has gone wi-ong from the first, and that the whole
 work must be taken to pieces, the materials sifted and rearrano-ed, and the

 favourite theoiy abandoned. No one will go through such a tiial who is not sup-

 ported by a genuine love of truth, and by a hearty conviction that it is a prize
 worth every sacrifice.

    But this lesson, at all events, we learn from the history of these disappoiutments,

                                                                   * Dr. Farr.

and from the still more melancholy spectacle which sometimes presents itself of

--men fighting against facts in support of a theory, and trjing to bend them to it,

and to suppress what makes against it : we learn that it is important to spare no

pains in the first collection of our materials, to neglect no source ot information,

Weand to despise no element of calculation.  learn to be slow to dogmatise, and

to be patient of correction and contradiction. And we learn, or ought to learn,

that we cannot successfidly conduct a statistical inquiry into any particular sub-

ject, without keeping our attention alive to the inquiries which other persons are

conducting in connexion with other, and, perhaps, apparently remote subjects, and

to the bearing which their discoveries may possibly have upon our own.
   Let me illustrate what I have been saying by a brief reference to our vital sta-

tistics.

Here, in the first place, we have an interesting illustration of the law of Stability

Weand of the law of Variation.  are able to deduce from the statistics of births

and of deaths averages of human life on which we can calculate with considerable

certainty ; and by so doing we are of coiu-se enabled to secure some important ad-

vantages. But we go further, we distinguish the various causes of death ; we

separate those which appear preventible from those over which we seem to have

little or no control ; and we conclude that if we can hit upon the proper remedies,

we may so far qualify the rigid law of Stability by invoking the aid of her elastic

sister the law of Variation, as to diminish in a sensible degree the rate of mortality,

Weand to lengthen the term of human life.  act on the conclusion, and we apply

our remedies. At first we flatter ourselves that we are in a fair way to attain our

object ; but, just as we are congratulating ourselves on having done so, some dis-

agreeable fact crops up in an unlooked for quarter, which seems to upset our entire

Wetheory.   have just now had our attention drawn to a striking illustration of

this contingency. Among the most prominent causes of death some years ago,

smallpox held a foremost place. To children it was especially fatal. But small-

pox, we learnt, was a disease preventible by vaccination. Vaccination was called

to our aid, and with great success. The deaths by smallpox were reduced within

an exceedingly narrow compass. But it appears while this, the most formidable,

foe of childhood has been repelled, infant mortality has not been reduced in any-

thing like a con-esponding proportion. Diptheria and scarlatina have taken the
place of the vanquished malady ; and the law of stability seems to be reasserting
its authority, and to be demanding that, whether it be by the one disease or bv the

other, a like proportion of children shall eveiy year fall victims among us. " Our

--statists, however, are not discom-aged by this imtoward discovery. They draw

from it the true inference, that the causes of infant mortality, and indeed of

human mortality at large, lie deeper than in the prevalence of a particular form of

disease ; and, while perceiving that vaccination alone will not put a stop to the
premature deaths of children, they still believe those premature deaths to be in a

measure preventible, and they seek for further methods of prevention. Having

found that the repression of a pai'ticular disease is not sufficient, they inquire into
the predisposing causes which render our children obnoxious to disease generally,

eliminating as it were from their inquiry the element of which they have already
ascertained the value, and not troubling themselves to look for specifics against scar-

latina or diptheria, but for general prophylactics against diseases of whatever kind.
In short they broaden the investigation, and seek to ascertain the general conditions

of health.

This is in itself a great step in advance ; but we nuist discard the proverb which

tells us that it is but the first step which costs trouble. The further the inquiry is

carried, the more its difficulties wiU show themselves. Remedies which, before

they have been tried, appear certain to be efficacious, may, when tried, only serve

to show that we have not yet reached the root of the matter; while the collateral

questions which the investigation wiU open up will prove, we may be well assured,

Whenpretty intricate ones to settle.  we are told that the primary object to aim

at is, the " placing a healthy stock of men in conditions of air, water, warmth,

food, dwelling, and work, most favourable for their development," we feel that we

have a task of pretty fair dimensions before us, and when we learn, among other

things, that " a bad land tenure is a cause of death " (a proposition which does not

appear to be limited to the case of Tipperary landlords), we may be pardoned for

doubting whether any one can assign bounds to the range of the inquiry we have

imdertaken.

It is therefore both natural, and satisfactory, that statistical inquiry should year

by year be extending to wider fields ; since no one branch of it can be successfully

pursued without speedily bringing us to the necessity of inquiring into" the pro-

gress which is being made in other branches. The statistics of education, of crime,

of pauperism, of labour, of health, of trade, of agiiculture, of manufactures, and of

every one of the details which enter into the survey of our national condition and

prospects, are interdependent, and connect themselves with another. At the same

time, not only do they admit of being studied separately, but more true progress

wiU be made by such a method of study. The educational inquirer examines the

bearings of juvenile labom-, for instance, from one point of view ; the sanitary in-

quirer examines them from another ; the inquirer into the causes and conditions of
pauperism from a third ; and so on. Where their inquiries tend to similar conclu-

sions, each confirms the other all the more for the independence of their ^lines of

argument. Where the conclusions are inconsistent, they are all the more sugges-

tive                      and suggestiveness, as it seems                                                                                                                      to me, is what constitutes the gTeat value of
                       ;

statistics.

The old sarcasm, that you may prove anything by figures, has no doubt much

truth in it. In the sense in which the words are usually taken, they convey a pro-

test against crude, and of course still more against unfair, statistics. But we may

ferhaps affix another idea to them, and one less uncomplimentary to our science,

  am sometimes inclined to look at a gi-eat mass of statistics, undigested and shape-

less as it seems, in the spirit in which the sculptor may be supposed to look at the

rude block of marble out of which he is to fetch the form of beauty that lies hid

within. Innumerable are the lessons which may be drawn from those hopeless-
looking figures, if only the student knows how to search for them; just as the

forms which might be developed from the marble are innumerable, if the artist

knows how to bring them to light. Remote as the region of statistics appears to

be from the region of the imagination, there is no pursuit of which it may more

truly be said that its success depends upon a proper exercise of the imaginative
Afaculty.
                          wholly unimaginative statist is as intolerable as an unimaginative

Averse writer. man must know what he is going to look for, and how he wiU look

for it, before he begins his examination of a mass of figures ; but he must keep his

mind open, throughout the process, to receive the suggestions which the study is

sure to produce. He must work upon an hypothesis, but he must be ready to aban-

don it as soon as he finds it untenable ; and he should be quick to form new hypo-
theses, and to subject his materials to new tests, as occasion arises. For all this

kind of work it is of great advantage that other minds should be brought into con-

tact with his own, and that he should profit by the suggestions which their inde-

pendent inquiries cannot fail to elicit.

It is of course obvious that meetings such as that in which we are now engaged,

are likely to advance the study in the direction which I have been indicating. But

that is not their sole advantage. It is, I think, no slight one, that we are called on

to dispute in public, and to address ourselves to a general audience. If our studies

are really valuable, if our methods of conducting them are sound, if we are doing
good service to our countay, we certainly ought to be able to interest and to attract
our hearers. The subjects with which we deal are of general concern; they are
not mere matters for closet speculation, nor is it good that we should treat them as
if they were. Neither does the discussion of them involve the necessity for the use

of strange or technical language                                                                                                                                               nor is it even necessary that we should weary our
                                                                                                                                                                            ;

hearers with long columns of figures. It is rather a sign of indolence than of pro-

fundity when speakers oppress. their hearers with technical phrases, and with pro-

cesses of arithmetic. These should be used in the closet, but should be as sparingly

as possible obtruded on the platform. Our methods of inquiry should indeed be
strictly scientific ; and we should never cease to be on our guard against fallacies,
but we should adapt our arguments to the circumstances of human nature, and
endeavour to make them attractive by making them intelligible. In a word, if I

may borrow an illustration which promises to take root among us, we must make

our hearers feel that we are all on the earth together, and that we are not mere

aeronauts addressing them from a balloon.

And here may 1 venture, as a Devonshire man, while bidding you heartily wel-

come to the county, to bespeak your indulgent consideration of the circumstances

Weof my compatriots ?              Devonians do not hurrj' on in the race of life quite so

rapidly as some of our fellow-countiymen. Perhaps I may venture to say without

oft'ence that, as compared with north-countrymen, we live slowly. Our birth-rate

is below the average of England, and so is our marriage-rate ; but then it must be
remembered that our death-rate is also low. If you compare us with Lancashire,

for instance, you will find that, for less than .32 births per 1000 in proportion to the

population here, there are more than .38 per 1000 there [the precise figures for

1867 are Devon 31'75, Lancashire 38-19] ; that, for less than 16 marriages per 1000
here, there are more than 19 per 1000 there [Devon 1.5-72, Lancashire 19-04]. But

then, for less than 20 deaths per 1000 here, there are nearly 27 per 1000 there

[Devon 19-72, Lancashire 26-83]. So, again, you will find that our children die

less rapidly than theirs, and our old people attain to greater ages. The proportion

which the deaths of children under .5 j'ears of age bear to the births in the year is,

in Devonshire 19^ per cent., and in Lancashire 323 ; while the proportion of deaths

of people over 65 years of age is, in Devonshire 18j per cent., and in Lancashire

8| per cent. Our mamages, too, take place at a more advanced age than do theirs.
Of our men only 6-0.5 per cent, marry under 21 years of age ; of theirs 8-45 per cent.

do so. For women the proportions are, in Devonshire 16-81 per cent., and in Lan-

cashire 21-10. In short, we are born, we many, and we die more slowly than they

do. But we are not behind them in all things. If the state of education is to be

judged of by the proportion of married people who can write their names, we may

hold up oui- heads even by the side of Lancashire. Of our bridegrooms (in 1867)

82-7 per cent, wrote their names like men ; of theirs only 76-8 per cent. Our

brides did still better in proportion : 78-6 of them wrote their names, while in Lan-
cashire only 56-0 did so. In the matter of wealth no doubt we are behind them

our assessment to the Schedules A, B, D of the income-tax comes to only £10 12s.

Ser head of our population, whUe theirs comes to £13 14s. On the other hand I
 oubt whether we have a very much larger number of paupers in proportion to our

population than they have (on the average of the three years 1866-68 they seem

to have had 65 able-bodied paupers to every 10,000 of the population, while we

had 69). And as regards criminals we fall far short of their ratio ; the proportion

of persons committed or bailed for trial in 1867 having been in Devonshire less than

4 to 10,000, and in Lancashire 12 to 10,000.

There are many other points on which it would be interesting to compare the

two counties ; and the comparison would be rendered still more valuable by ex-

tending it to other counties, of which these miglit be taken as the tj-pes. But

time forbids my entering into the details which would be requisite. I have refeiTed

to the point principally for the purpose of reminding you that observations which

might have been applicable in one part of England may be very much out of place

in another ; that each county has lessons of its own to teach, as well as to receive

and that Devonshire, though she does not aspire to the position of Lancashire as

the standard bearer of British manufacturing and commercial enterprise, is not

without her own claims to respect and admiration in regard of many of the essen-

tials of hmnan happiness.

I return from these local remarks to the wider field which more properly claims

our attention ; and I desire to invite you, who are so much more competent for
the task than I am, to endeavour to realize for yourselves as far as may be the
general character and tendencies of the age in which we live. To me it appears to

be emphatically, and in the highest sense of the term, a statistical age ; an age, that

is to say, in wliich we are inquiring extensively and methodically into the facts by

which we are surrounded, comparing ourselves with our neighbours, measm-ing our

progress, and estimating our prospects with unprecedented care. Nor do we stop

here                         but,  giving a practical turn to  om* inquiries, we  study not only to ascertain,
                          ;

but to husband and to develope our resources. Pressed, it may be, by the increas-

--ing competition of foreign nations, pressed, too, by the consideration that our
wealth and our desires for enjoyment are increasing far more rapidly than our popu-
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                        177

--lation, and consequently than our supply of labour, and conscious, moreover, that

the non-reproductive sources of our material wealth, such as our minerals, are being

very heavily drawn upon, we are daily casting about to tind how this competition
may best be sustained, how the balance between capital and labour is to be pre-
served, and how we can best economize those supplies which we fear may some day

fail us.

  We are beginning to feel that the time for waste has gone by. It may, perhaps,

provoke a sneer from the cynic when he hears that England is becoming anxious
as to the possible exhaustion of her coal-measures, and is considering how and

where she can find water enough for her population. One cannot help being re-

--minded of the sarcastic remark of the American traveller that we had a tidy little

country enough, but that for his part he was always afraid of tumbling over the

edge of it. There is some truth at the bottom of the taunt ; but it is not to such
considerations that I wish to direct your attention. Rather I desire to point to

the satisfactory indications, which such inquiries as I refer to present, of the deter-
mination of our people to make a stand against the bane of national prosperity,
Waste. I speak not only of waste of raw materials, but of waste in all its mate-

--rials, but of waste in all its forms, waste of power, of labour, of time, of health,

and of life. Year by year we are learning to make skill do the work of strength, to
draw greater results from equal eflbrts, and to supply our labourers with every com-
fort, every advantage which science can devise for enabling them to fight the bat-

tle of life on better terms ; and hence it comes that the question of education is not

only claiming a larger share of our attention, but is presenting itself in new phases;

and that we are looking to education in physical science, and even to technical

Weeducation, with such unwonted interest.  are grappling, I think, more boldly

than we ever did before with the difficult problems of our national life, and are ad-

vancing to their solution with greater breadth of view and greater confidence of step.

   Let me ofier an illustration of the economy of labour which is taking place
among us, by a reference to some remarkable statistics which have quite recently
been laid before us. Last week my friend, Mr. Shaw Lefevre, introduced the Mer-
chant Shipping Bill into the House of Commons ; and after pointing out the enor-
mous increase which had taken place in our commercial navy in the last fourteen
years, and showing that we had now as much sea-going tonnage as all other na-

tions put together, proceeded to say that, while the amount of tonnage had in-

creased since 1854 by no less than 50 per cent., the number of seamen required to

navigate it had increased by only 21 per cent. ; that in 1868 we required one man
less to work every 100 tons of shipping than we required in 1854, or, in other words,
that we could work our present marine with 55,000 fewer men than would have been
necessary for the same amount of tonnage fourteen years ago. And to show to how

great an extent this economy had been brought about by the introduction of

machinery and improved methods of working, Mr. Lefevre gave the particulars of
the manning of twenty-two large sailing-vessels in the years 1849, 1859, and

1869 respectively, showing that in the first of those years they required crews

--amounting to 463 men, in the second to 417, and in the third to no more than

348 the ships being identical, and the voyages nearly the same.

   I have dwelt at some length on these figures, because they suggest to me seve-
ral reflections. The first is one in which I think we may justly indulge, and which
is the counterblast to that sarcasm which I quoted just now from an American

--critic ; that the power of England is not to be measured by the dimensions of this

little island, bvit rather by those of the great empire of the seas which it has so
long been our boast to rule. If we were to fall over our country's edge we should

only fall into an element which we have made our own. England, it may truly be
said, that is, the mere island of Great Britain, is but the shadow of herself, and we

might address our rivals in the proud words of the Talbot of Shakespeare

       " You are deceived, my substance is not here;

         For what you see is but the smallest part
         And least proportion of humanity.
         I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here.

          It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,

         Your roof were not sufficient to contain it."

178 REPORT--1869.

    Justly, then, in our statistical inquiries we take note, not only of the progress of

England proper, but of all parts of the great British empire ; and this you will

--observe in looking to the Tarious collections of information which Parliament is

annually making for us, that year by year fidler statistics are produced with relation

to om- colonies and dependencies. That valuable 'Fifteen Years' Abstract,' which

has now reached its sixteenth number for tJie United Kingdom, has been adapted

to the British colonies for four or fire years past, and to India for two or three.

We have, in addition to these compendious handbooks, several more voluminous

collections of tables relating both to our colonies and to foreign countries, enume-

rating not only their areas, populations, amounts of revenue, expenditure, and debt,

and the extent of their trade ; but in the cases of many of oui- colonies giving most

useful information as to their moral and social condition, the state of education, of

crime, of immigration, of wages, of prices, of land sales, mortgages, savings' banks,

and an immense variety of other matters. All these are a testimony to the extended

character of our transmarine connexions and interests, and may be taken at once in

explanation and in justification of our position as a colonizing power. In spite of

all that may be said as to the alteration of the relations between England and her

dependencies, she need hardly be called on to abdicate her proud title of the " Mo-

ther of Nations," while she can point to these effects of her influence in every

quarter of the globe.

 --Another reflection which occun'ed to me when I dwelt on those statistics of our

shipping just now was this, oiu- population continues to increase ; but it increases

far less rapidly than our wealth. That is a fact which, if it stood alone, would in-

dicate that in the struggle between capital and labour the advantage was likely to

be on the side of labour, for that the demand would be in excess of the supply.

But this advantage is to a considerable extent corrected by the increasing economy

of labom- indicated by the figures whicli Mr. Lefevi-e gives us for a single trade,

and which are no doubt equally applicable to other trades.

    It is sufficiently obvious that such economy nmst in the main be advantageous

at the same time we must not forget that the displacement of labour is often the

cause of suffering, and sometimes, when it occurs suddenly, of very severe suffer-

ing. It may produce, not only individual disti-ess, but, imder certain circumstances,

even political danger. If it were possible so to reconsti-uct society as to give every

individual member of it a direct share in every gain made by society as a whole,

this particular danger would of com-se vanish. But this is the theoiy of Socialism ;
and we have no evidence that, if socialism were in the ascendant, society would

make these gains at all. Reasoning leads us to the conclusion that it would not

and the time is probably {av distant when England will accept a system which has

so obvious a tendency to discourage private and individual enterprise.

    Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that Englishmen are beginning to look to

Government for assistance, and to disti'ust individual action, to a much gi-eater ex-

tent than foiinerly.

    Some years ago it used to be thought to be the duty of the Government to foster

private entei-prise by protective laws, monopolies, bounties, and differential duties.

The great Free Trade movement overthrew this theory, and left upon us the im-

pression that the more private enterprise was left to itself and the less the Govern-

ment interfered with it the better. But of late the tide of public opinion has

seemed to be setting in a somewhat different direction. Not that we are going

back towards the                                             protective  system                             but that,  on the  one hand, we are beginning
                                                                                                         ;

to invite or to urge the Government to take upon itself work for which a few years

back we shoiUd ha-\e deemed it utterly incompetent, and which we should have

jealously reserved for private hands; while, on the other hand, our private enter-

prise is becoming more and more dependent on the assistance of the Government

for its own proper organization and development. Thus, in this matter of our

Merchant Shipping, while we have been repealing our navigation laws and sweep-

ing away every vestige of a differential duty, we have been creating a code of al-

most Brobdignagian dimensions for the regulation of every detail of our marine

affairs. The choice of proper masters and mates is no longer left to the discretion

of  the  shipowner                                           he must  employ men                            who  have  passed a Government  examina-
                                                          ;

 misconduct. The contracts between owners and seamen are regulated by the Go-
 vernment, and are made under the direct superintendence of public officers. The

 proper construction and fitting of the ships, their sanitary an-angements, the quan-
 tity and quality of the provisions and medicines, and the strength and texture of
the anchors and chain cables, are all matter for the consideration of the same pater-
nal mind. Nor is this kind of care confined to a single branch of industry. There

are many others with which the CTOvernment concerns itself, and still more with
which it is pressed to do so ; while at the same time we are becoming accustomed
to its direct action in the management of various classes of business, and are not

 unwilling to see that action fmther extended.

    Can it then be that we are learning to sink the idea of the individual in the idea
of the State ? Do the mass of the people, as our constitution becomes more demo-
cratic, begin to see in the Government an organ better fitted to do their work than
they find in the classes above them ? Perhaps, as monopolies are put down, and

privileges abated, and education is more generally diffused, and a closer approach

to equality is efi'ected, the tendency to deal with questions nationally, rather than

by the action of classes or of indi^id uals, may increase. Perhaps, as the competi-
tion of foreigners presses upon us with greater severity, and as we become con-

scious that it is only to be encountered by the aid of all the resources, all the edu-

cation, all the organization that we can command, it is natm'al that the desire to

invoke the powerful aid of the State in gathering up all tlie elements of our strength
and giving- it the best possible direction, should become more and more marked.

Perhaps there may be something in the nature of things which renders coopera-
tion more and more necessary as we make gi-eater progress in the work of subduing
the universe. In the ruder states of society, when industiy is in its infancy, the

isolated labour of the individual suffices to procure the simple necessaries of life

which he requires. As civilization advances, and greater results are sought, co-
operation begins, and the division of labom- is resorted to. By degrees we intro-
duce, first the small capitalist, then the larger one, and then the joint-stock com-
pany. It may be that the tendency to invoke the aid of the Government is but
another step in the same career. Or possibly we maj^ explain it by the fact that
the progress of civilization is, as of necessity, accompanied by the gTOwth of new
dangers against which precautions have to be taken which the State alone is com-
petent to take. In a civilized society, as we have lately been reminded, deaths by
violence, that is to say by accident, have a tendency to increase. In England they

are rapidly increasing, and special precautions are needed to render safe that free

application of the vast forces of nature to the intercourse and the arts of life which

is now so essential to our prosperity. Or, lastly, it may be that in the increasing

struggle for wealth the interests of the weaker classes, of the poor, the young, the

female, are likelj' to be set aside imless the State interfere for their protection : and

the acknowledged demand for such interference may be another cause for the ten-

dency to which I have refen-ed. Such seems, at all events, to be the tendency of
the age, and it is one which it is impossible to notice without some uneasiness.

That we have hitherto been somewhat too jealous of the State, and that it would
be wise to call in its aid rather more freely, may probably be true. But the gi-eat-
ness of England has been achieved by the self-reliant energies of individual Eng-

lishmen, and by the energies of individual Englishmen it will be best maintained.

whose piu-pose was to carry out the same investigations in the Devonshire loca-
lities which occupied the attention of the British Association in its far wider and
far more important field. Seven volumes had been published of the ' Transactions

as Presidents, Mr. Spence Bates, Mr. Edw. Vivian, Dr. Daubeny, Earl Russell,
Sir J. D. Coleridge, Mr. Pengelly, and Mr. George Bidder, and the next President
Elect is Mr. Froude. Scarcely any portion of the local area had been unexplored,
and special attention had been given to the attractions of the localities v?here the
Meetings had been held. The number of Members had constantly increased, and
pride wan felt in the fact that Devonshire had, liowever imperfectly, and at how-
ever remote a distance, imitated the example and followed in the footsteps of
the greater Association.

                    Oji Penal Law as applied to Prison Discipline.
                         By Sir John Bowling, LL.I)., F.R.S.

   The object of this paper was to show the very unsatisfactory working of the
Prisons Act of 1865, and that while it allowed magistrates and governors to make

jail-labour remunerative, it permitted the greatest inattention to this important

object ; and that consequently the cost of prisoners and the produce of their work
was so incredibly various as to make it difficult to believe that the subjects of Great
Britain were under the rule of any common legislation. The coimty prison of
Devon was one of the most remarkable instances of the bad effects of routine, for
large amoimts of money had been spent to provide machinery for wasting labour.

A treadmill, at the cost of £1760, imposing in interest alone an annual charge of

more than £80, had lately been erected in Exeter prison, though it was well
known that the treadmill had been rejected in every prison in Scotland, and was
repudiated in most of the prisons of the civilized world ; the invention was a cala-
mity, its employment an opprobrium. The labour of the hundreds of con\-icts
passing through that establishment left nothing but heavy cost to the commimity.
It was disgraceful that in an enlightened and inquiring country the cost of felons
should vary from nil up to more than £120 each per annum. Prison inspectors
are helpless when magistrates are obstinate ; and to nothing but the application of
some sound general principles enforced by parliamentary reqmrements could we look
for any general improvement. The contrasts presented by the best conducted
prisons of the United States and the Continent, when compared with our own, is
disgraceful to British reputation, whether as regards the reformatory or the pecu-
niary residts of their administration. The author referred with great and hopefid

-- --satisfaction to the International Confess proposed to be held in some great Euro-

pean city he trusted London would oe selected in the coming year, in which the
experience of the highest authorities woiUd be brought to bear on this important

question. He thought that the number of our prisons was far too great, and iU

adapted to these purposes, and that nine-tenths of that number might be usefully
sold ; and new prisons, on the best models, built not only with a view to economy,
but to the higher questions of discipline. Great advantage woidd be found if par-

--ticular trades were carried on in particular prisons shoemaking, for example, in
--one, tailoring in another selected with reference to the locality itself. In Belgium

the army was clothed by prison labour, in France the Government received £178,000
for work in 1868. In the United States the best prisons left a large balance of

profit to the State after the deduction of every outlay. He pressed the necessity of

making, as far as possible, retribution to the injured one of the requirements to be
laid upon the convict, and gave elaborate reasons for the abolition of the punish-
ment of death.

              Some Statistics of Railways in their Relation to the Public.

                                  By Eaphael Brandon.

   The author showed that the returns made for railway investments had not been
such as might have been expected from capital laid out, and that the public had

every reason to complain of the present railway system. He suggested that it

could only be accomplished by uniting all the railways under one general manage-
ment, to form them into a separate branch of the public service. The author con-

tended that a passenger should be enabled to travel one joiu-ney, of any distance,

in a given direction for a sum little more than nominal. In 1868, 310,150,915

passengers travelled on the railways, paying an average fare of 11 fd. to ll^d.
Six times the number of passengers could be caiTied for a very small (if any) ad-
ditional expense ; and if a universal fare of 3d. was charged for any distance for
each person, at a verv moderate computation, six times the present number of persons
would travel, and would produce £23,261,318, being £8,536,516 in excess of the re-

ceipts of 1865 from passengers only. This calculation was made supposing that each
person pays only a 3d. fare ; but he would divide them into three classes as now, and

--fix the fares for any distance at the following rates : first class. Is. ; second, Qd.

third, 3d. For such first-class passengers who would pay £10 and £5 annually in

addition for such distinction should travel in carriages provided exclusively for

them. He proposed that separate lines should be constructed for the goods and pas-

senger services ; and he would make passengers pay for all luggage that had to
be placed in the van, which would largely increase the revenue. There would be,
no doubt, many who would say that the idea of can-ying a passenger from London
to Edinburgh for 3d. is preposterous, but they must remember that it was not
imtil Sir Rowland Hill had shown its feasibility that any one thought it was reason-
able to take a letter from London to Edinburgh for the same charge as fi'om London
to Richmond. Under the most adverse circumstances, for instance, that by his
plan not one more passenger was induced to travel, there would still be a gain to the
railways of £2,000,000, a year. In conclusion, he showed that the scheme would
have a beneficial effect on the labour markets in enabling a working man to re-
move at once to, the district where his skill is in demand, and would thus tend

to equalize the value of labour in the country.

             On the Want of Statistics on the Question of MLvecl Eaces.
             By Hyde Claeke, F.S.S., For. Sec. Ethnological Society.

   The author stated that the existing materials are fragmentary, and admit of no
comparison, and that the approaching Congress of the English and American
Empires should be taken advantage of to obtain figures as to mulattos, half-

breeds, Anglo-Maories, eurasians, &c., to determine the question of vitality of
mixed races.

              On the Distinction between Bent and Land Tax in India.
                              By Hyde Clarke, F.S.S. Sfc.

   In various parts of India rent and land-tax have been fused into one sum, and
hence a serious confusion exists as to the functions and duties of Government in
its respective capacities of landowner and tax-receiver. This acts likewise in re-
tarding the establishment of private freeholders in India. The writer urges the
desirability of returning to the original distinctions of rent and land-tax. These
are observed in other parts of the East. In Turkey and Persia the land-tax com-
monly represents 10 per cent., but occasionally of late 15 per cent. The remainder

of the sum received by the Government may be treated as rent.

       Note on Variations in the Bapidity and Bate of Human Thought.
                              By Hyde Clakke, F.S.S. ^c.

   The purpose of this note is to extend the range of statistics or the numerical
method of investigation. The author states that after an attack of typhus fever,
finding his physical system much weakened, he put himself through an examina-
tion to test whether his mental system was affected. This he found not to be the
case as to quality, but as to speed of thought. By a rough process of test he
devised, he found the speed was reduced to one-fourth of the previous power.
The correctness of reasoning was not aflPected, but processes requiring rapidity of
thought, as poetical composition, were influenced. It was some years before the
former rate of rapidity was restored. The practical conclusions are, that the rate

of thought is subject to great fluctuations within the same individual at various
periods, that these fluctuations are possibly daily and hourly, and that the difl'er-
ences between diflerent i)idividnals at the same time must be very considerable.

   Some Statistics of the National Educational League. By Jesse Collings.

                  On-tTie.Teclniical Education of the Arjricxdtural Labourer.
                                E>/ J. Bailey Denton, C.E., F.G.S.

    The object of this paper was to show that, in addition to, and associated with,

 elementary school teaching, technical education in the duties of agriciiltm-al laboiu"
should be encouraged as a means of making greater the value of manual work.

The result, the author contended, would be that the former would have better work
performed and be better able to pay higher wages, it being a mistake to believe that
physical health and strength were alone required to make a farm-labourer all that
he need be. The business of the farmer is gradually becoming more like that of
other industrial classes, in which technical knowledge and education are highly
esteemed. To regulate wages simply by the physical strength of a laboui-er,
without regard to skill or knowledge, cannot be maintained ; while to pay higher
wages without increasing the quantity or improving the quality of labour could
only be maintained by impoverishing "the farmer -without increasing the produce of
the country. It was advanced on the author's own experience, that the farm-
labourers of Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, and Cornwall, earning from 7s. to 12*-. a
week, performed work of much less value than those of Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and
Northumberland, where wages vary from I2s. to 18s. a week; and that a northern
fanner employing the latter secured a better return for his money than a soutliern
farmer employing the former. By the technical teaching of Dorsetshire labourers,
who had originally been emploj'ed by the author at from 7s. to 10s. a week, he had
been enabled to pay the same men from 18s. to 25s. a week with advantage.

   The mode of conveying technical information to the children of agi'icultural
labourers which the author recommended, was to teach them at school to read
books purposely written on the common objects of the farm, so as to secure an early
interest in the "duties upon which they would be aftei-wards engaged. These chil-
dren's books should deal with the animals, insects, crops, and weeds of the farm,
and should be written purposely in language and style as interesting as possible, in
order to interest the worst-taught branch of the community. Thus primary and
technical education would proceed together. The teachers at the school should be
specially qualifled to interest children in agiicultural objects. As soon as the
youths leave school and take part in farming duties, the author proposed that they
should be placed under leading labourers in different departments of the farm, and
not be allowed to rim from one duty to anothei', as is now the case ; and to encourage
the best workmen to con-^-ey information to youths, it was proposed that examina-
tions should take place periodically, and rewards or prizes be given to the teachers

as well as to the taught.

Statistics of Invention illustrating the Policy of a Patent-Law.

                  By Henet Diecks, C.E., LL.D.

The author stated that the time seemed to have arrived for a close inquiiy into

the policy of a patent law, as the subject was not only likely to come before Par-

liament next Session, but had also excited the attention of the working classes,

Heas one aflecting their interests.  considered it a first requisite in the treatment

Heof the subject to trace the inquiry both historically and statisticallj'.  urged

the disadvantage of excessive patent-fees, and showed that under the existing

liberal system a great impulse had been given to invention ; also that heavy patent-

fees, acting like a prohibitory duty on commerce, only served to limit the inventive

ingenuity of the country. He refeiTed to the thirteenth century for its gun-

powder, and to the fifteenth century for its printing-press, both of which, although

unpatented, left a long waste period without any considerable progress. The

increase of patents since 1852 he looked upon as afibrding- evidence of the impulse

given to the trade and commerce of the country. He objected to the opinion that

the inventive faculty was innate in mankind; and likewise to the supposition

that we had arrived at a state of improvement in arts and mauufactm-es so emi-
nent that we might now safely cast away all expectancy of future benefits from
the protection sought through the medium of patent laws. He contended that
the inventor was encouraged in his researches and labours, despite all opprobrium

to which he might be sulijected, by the expectancy of reaping fame and fortune;

and that no process so easily secures these to him as patent law. He cited cases,

and gave a table of the progress of the invention of the steam-engine, in support of
his statements and arguments closing with the observation that the inventor was

                                                                                                                                                                   ;

as useful and important to society now as ever he was, and that advance in inven-

tions and improvements was required ; and tlmt purpose could only be promoted

by the protection of a patent law.

On International Coinage. By W. Faek, M.D., D.C.L., F.B.S.

Starting from the principle that the current coins should be metiic weig-hts of

the precious metals, and that the expense of coinage shoidd be taken as a seigniorage

--from the fine gold in the coin which would, within limits sufficiently near for all

--practical purposes, retain its actual value, as its cost of production woidd remain

unchanged the author proceeds to show that the decaf/ram, or ten grams of

standard gold, to be called a Victoria, or by any name, would form the most conve-

nient coin of account. It would make a well-defined useful international coin.

A heavy half-sovereign weighs 4 grams ; consequently a fourth part of it is one
Agram by weight, and one half-crown in value.
                                               heavy sovereign weighs 8 grams

a decagram is 10 grams, and in gold is worth 10 haK-croAvns, or 25 shillings.

1. The Ten-ffram (decagram) of standard </old= the Victorta=the 2o-s7iUb')iff piece.

The gram is a weight in daily use among the people of France, Italy, Switzer-
Aland, and Belgium ; its multiplies are in aU their shops and houses.
                                                                       coin of

standard gold weighing ten gi-ams coidd be appreciated and be tested by theni at

any time. But the Napoleon, weighing 6-4516 grams, or a 25-franc piece, weighing

8-0646 gi-ams,is expressed in fractions, not easily comprehensible, while a ten-gram

coin of standard gold is perfectly intelligible, and its weight is easily determinable.
Under these circumstances no one can be surprised that Cobden's friend, M. Che-

valier, one of the highest French economical authorities, should propose a ten-grain

gold unit as the basis of the monetary system of the world. The metric system of

weights and measures wiU in the end be inevitably adopted, like the Arabic figm-es,

by every civilized nation. That system is the real glory of France, which none can

contest "or deny, but the glory is incomplete so long a-s the measiuing imit of value

is not the gram, or the ten-gram weight of standard gold.

   The ten-gram gold unit of money necessarily ditlers fi-oni anyof the units now
in use ; it will be a new international coin ; but its scientific basis commends it to

the philosophic minds of Germany. Holland, Scandinavia, and Italy; while it has

accidentally strong claims on the three nations which coin the largest quantities of

gold. France has in it a kind of paternal interest ; it is the natural develop-

ment of her scientific system of weights and measures. The English sovereign

weighs almost exactly eight grams ; and the passage to a ten-gram coin is easy, as

the new coin decimally divided embraces two of the principal subordinate silver

Acoins in use in England.  ten-gram gold coin is almost the exact equivalent of

a six-dollar American gold coin. The new scientific coin is a natural development

of the English and the American coinage, corresponding in increase of weight with
the increase of the existing quantity of gold and the increase in the values of com-

modities to be measured.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         .
   I will endeavour to show how the new unit is deduced directly from the basis of

the metric system, and how readily it can be adjusted by slight variations of fine-

ness to our own existing svstem of money.

   All the units of the metric weight's and measures are based on one fundamental

unit; the metre.
184 REPORT 1869.

The unit of weight is the gram, which is deduced from the weight of a cubic

centimetre of distilled water at its maximum density. It would therefore be in

strict analogy with this system to take a gram of standard gold as the unit of the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         _

measure of value ; for then, as a cubic centimetre is the volume unit, the weight
of its volume of water the weight unit, that weight, or a multiple of it, would be

the unit measure of values. This would be simple, logical, and in strict accordance
with the basis of the metric system, which renders the passage from linear and

superficial to cubic units, from cubic units to weights, so easy. The idea of weight
is totally different from the idea of volume, but the two are connected by the in-

tervention of water ; so the idea of value is totally different from the idea of weight,

but the two are connected by the intervention of standard gold. Then the imit of

work, a kilogram lifted a metre in a second, and the measure of the value of that

work, would be alike connected with the metric system.

   The principal commercial witnesses before the Royal Commission, and the Com-

missioners themselves, attach the first importance to the fact, that conti-acts to pay

in money should imply contracts to pay fixed weights of fine gold. Now it hap-

pens that the English sovereign does weigh, as it comes from the Mint, very closely

on 8 grams                                                                   it  may by the  tolerance  indeed  exceed 8 grams.  By simply adding
                                                                          ;

only a small fr-action of a grain (i grain) to the alloy, leaving the fine gold pre-

cisely in its present quantity, we get the sovereign theoretically, as it is practically,

8 grams in weight, the half-sovereign 4 grams, the half of this again 2 grams,

worth a crown, and consequently the gram worth half-a-crown, an old favourite.
                                                                                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  185

so that live of the new cents would be of the same value as six of the present farthings

= three halfpence. The money of account of all denominations would be gold.

Accounts of money and weights of gold would be represented by the same figures.

   100 of the gi-and gold coins would weigh a kilogram ; and as' 1000 kilograms are
a metric ton, 100,000 new coins would be a metric ton of standard gold.

If the Mint assay and stamp kilogi-ams of standard bar gold so as to guarantee the

fineness, these kilograms of gold will be convenient forms of bidlion, available for
Aexportation, or for deposits in banks.
                                                                                                                   thousand kilogi-am bars weigh a metric ton,

=worth 100,000 of the great gold coins. A. million of these coins ( V- 1,000,000)

would weigh ten tons of standard gold, and be worth a million and quarter poimds

of the present sterling.

   The multiplication of pounds sterling by -8 converts them into the ten-gram
gold coin. The specific gravity of a new sovereign is 17-58, water being one, and

this enables us under the metric system to pass from value to weight, fro^ weight

to volume.

   Accounts are now kept in England in four imits, (1) pounds, (2) shillings,
(3) pence, (4) farthings. Under the ten-gram gold coinage accounts may be exhi-

bited in two columns.

  To illustrate the new ten-gram gold coinage, the author gave the revenues of

some of the principal States of the world in their present coins, and in the proposed

international coins.

   The annual State expenditure of 432 million people was 456 million of these ten-
gram Victorias (o-crown pieces), that is a little more than a Victoria a head, or

more exactly 1 Victoria and 55 cents a head = l Victoria, 5 threepennies, and
=5 cents 1 Victoria, 5| Anglo-Saxon pennies.

         2. Clianges in the English Coinage U7ider the Ten-gram gold unit.

   The ten-gram unit of gold -915 fine, instead of -916 fine, would contain exactly
the same quantity of fine gold as 1^ sovereign, worth five-and-twenty shillings in

the present currency                                                                                               and if the Mint and Bank cost of making and sustaining the
                                                                                                                ;

gold comage is fixed at 15, 10, or 5 centigrams of fine gold for eveiy decaoram, the
fineness wiU be -900, or -905, or -910 ; while the amount of fine gold taken as

seigniorage wall be worth from od. to M. or to l|rf. in the present currency, which
will be as much a part of the cost of production as the expenditure at'the gold
diggings. The cost of producing 9 grains of fine gold is expressed in our currency

by 24s. 7d., so that if the Mint and Bank cost of converting ten grams of standard

gold (-900 fine) into a coin, replacing its wear, is expressed by 5d., the value of
the ten-gram com current is '25s., of which it will be the equivalent so long as the
customer of the Mint has to send 916 grams of fine gold, or its equivalent in money,
for every 10 coins he ^ets, each containing 9 grams of fine gold.

 _ At the International Conference suggested bv the Royal Commission this ques-
tion of a universal standard of fineness and of" seigniorage could be settled ; and
whatever the decision may be, the change will cause but slight and temporary in-

convenience in this country.

                                                                                                                   3. Gold Coin.

England can at once coin the sovereign of 8 grams of standard gold with the

slightest possible inconvenience, and without changing its contents of fine gold.
AThe half-sovereign will weigh 4 grams.
                                                                                                                   gold crown of 2 grams might also be

coined.

The only new coin necessarily required is a fine five-crown gold piece of 10 grams,
which would probably in time get into circulation as a sort of new guinea, even if
it were not at once stamped as the international coin.
more popular than small coins.                                                                                                    Large coins are "o-enerally

   Once accepted as the international unit, the 10-gram piece might with advantage
become the basis of a decimal money of account for England : the o-ram of o-old
the decigram and the centigram being the subordinate units, to be represented
with some of their multiples in gold, silver, and copper coins. The Eno-lish

standard gold coins luider this system are the coin to be called Victoria, or some

other name (10 grams), the sovereitrn (8 grams), the half-sovereign (4 grams), the

crown (2 grams) ; and lower than this it is useless to go, as the coins in gold.become
too small for use. The sovereig-n and the half-sovereign in England might ulti-

mately be replaced by the gold Victoria and its half. In France the Napoleon of

20   francs, still circulating, if brought into this                   system would weigh 6-400  grams
                                                                                                                        ;

it would in due time be superseded.                                                   ,

                                 4. Silver Coin.

    Silver coins are said, under the single gold standard, to be counters ; there is no

restraint on their weight or iineness, and they need not be at first international.

    In England the silver coins will represent the same proportions of the gold unit

as those now in circidation ; but a slight change in weight is required. The silver

crown -weighs 28-2759 grams -925 fine, and contains 26-15.5 grams of fine silver.

Now the Mint pxu-chases standard silver at rates ranging from 5s. to 5a-. 2d. (say

5s.  Id.) an ounce  of  31-1035  gi-ams                                so that if it  coined silver without charge,  the
                                                                    ;

crovm should weigh 30-594, the half-crown 15-297 gi-ams. The half-crown now

coined actually weighs 14-138 grams; the difterence is the Mint chai-ge (1-159

gram). The fine silver in the half-crown weighs 13-078 grams. By making the

half-crown exactly 15 grams and of the same fineness as the five-franc piece, namely,

·900, it will contain 13-500 gi-ams of fine silver ; that is, it will weigh more by

exactly 0-862 gram than the present half-crown, and it will be better, as half the

addition (-422 gram) -wall be in fine silver. The Mint will still retain under this

arrangement 4--59 per cent, of fine silver (one shilling in 21) as the cost of coinage.

Then the silver cro-«Ti will vreigh exactly 30 grams, the half-crown 16 grams,

the florin 12 grams, the. shilling 6 grams, the sixpence 3 grams, the threepenny 1^

gram and there the silver coinage will stop. Five crowns will contain the same
                              ;
                                                                                         tiorin will
= Aamount of fine silver (1-50 X -9 1.35 grams) as six five-franc pieces.

contain nearly the same weight of fine silver (10-80 grams) as the rupee (10-69

grams).

   This is only one of the -ways in -which the object may be obtained of making our

silver coins simple midtiples' of gi-ams of standard silver by var^nng the fineness.
The French have the standard of -900 fine for their five-franc piece, and the lower

standard (-835) for the franc itself and the other silver coins. By making the half-
cro-wn of 15 grams -872 tine, it will contain the same amount of fine silver as it
contains at present (13-078 grams), and the Mint will get its present profit. If the
silver coin were of the same fineness as the gold, the one gram of gold would, at the

averao-e market value, purchase 15-5 grams of silver ; but as the expense of coining

silver'^is necessarily greater than the expense of coining gold of the same ^alue,

the weight of fine "metals in the gold and silver coinage should be in a lower ratio

(sav 1 to 15), to compensate for the difterence in the cost of production.

                                 5. JBronze Coin.

The silver threepenny piece represents a decigram of gold, and is the equivalent

of 12 farthings of the present currency. The centigram of gold is the lowest imit
of value recognized in the new system of account, and it may for the sake of

brevity be called a cent. The United States' cent is their lowest unit ; it is worth

nearly two English farthings, and is too large to express the graduated prices of

articles of small value. The French centime, on the other hand, is too small a unit

for general use in Europe ; it is the fifth part of the lowest American unit, and only

Now2.:^ -4 of our present farthing.                                    the value of the centigram of gold is the mean

                        2 ji

convenient low unit, and is admirably suited to use all over the civilized world.
   The smaU centigrams of gold will be represeiit('d by bronze coin. The value of

the copper coin was formerly expressed in the weight of metal, but this is no longer
the case ; the bronze in the English penny is worth about a farthing. The three
coins in use ai-e convenient counters ; and the farthing and halfpenny are usually

threepenny silver coin, will be conA'eniently supplemented by bronze coins of 1, 2,
3, 4, and 5 cents ; the 5 cents being the half of the silver 10-cent piece would cor-
respond to three halfpence of the present currency. The cent will supply a better

graduated scale to express prices than the farthing, halfpenny, and penny, and

popular demand will soon determine how many of each coin should be struck.
Bronze coins of three sizes are now unnecessary, as no attempt is made to express
value by weight. One type of coin, inscribed with one cent, two cents, three
cents, four cents, and five cents, may suffice. They wall form part of the decima-

lized currency. I annex a scheme of the coins.

crowns), 75 centigrams or cents. For smaller sums cents alone suffice ; for instance,

we may say the price of a loaf of bread is 22 cents, of a pound of beef 30 cents.

Although the coined shilling only consists of eleven-pennyworth of silver, it

exactly represents in an account twelve pence, or the 20th part of a gold sovereigTi

and a penny, consisting of a farthing's worth of bronze, represents the value of the

240th part of a sovereign. So, under the gram system, half-a-crown in silver,

weighing 15 gTams, represents one gram of standard gold ; a threepenny piece (10

cents) represents the tenth of a gTam, or a clecic/ram of gold ; a bronze cent repre-

sents a centigram of gold, ^^alue is invariably expressed in weights of standard

gold, which are conveniently represented in tangible manageable silver and bronze

tokens.

5 crowns will contain the same amoimt of fine silver as 6 five-franc pieces. The

                                      8. Economies of Decimal Coitutge.

   Several imits of weight are required, and when the Roman notation was in use

the advantages of connecting these units by the factor ten were not clear. It was
accordingly never done in England. In troy weight four units are recognized, the
frain, the pennyweight, the ounce, and the pound ; 24 grains make one pennvweight,

    pennyweights one ounce, 12 ounces one pound. The money units are tased on

these weights ; 240 pennyweights of silver were a pound,and were so called, //J/'w, the
origin of our £1. The pound sterling and the penny fell in evil days to a third of

=their primary weight, still 12 pence became a shilling, 20 shillings =240 pence £1.

Then the penny was halved and quartered, so there are four money units in use.

==connected by the factors 20, 12, and 4; thus £1 20 shillings 240 pence = 960

farthings. The clumsy Roman notation was discarded and was displaced by the

beautiful Arabic notation, where each figure in a series is ten more, or a tenth
less than the same figm-e to its right or left ; hence all the transcendent achieve-
ments of modern arithmetic. Unfortunately om- money as well as weight and

measure units remained unaltered, and all are now in a state so chaotic as to
reflect disgrace on the intelligence of England. To perform a simple sum in
compoimd multiplication or division is beyond the powers of ninety-nine in a

hundred educated men, who, on leaving school, forget the tables which have per-
plexed, wearied, and wasted so many of their hours.

   It is difiicult to estimate the economy of time and thought through the whole of
life to be realized by the substitution of units decimally related to each other in
the place of the units now in use.

    France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Russia,
Greece, Sweden, Turkey, China, Japan, and the United States of America, have
all decimal moneys of account, and England would probably have already enjoyed
this inestimable advantage had it not been for the difficulties of dealing with the

penny. The penny is the rock on which the late project of decimalization split. The
phantom of a duodecimal notation in arithmetic deceived nobody. The price of a
peat number of articles is measured by the penny. Thus the price of 4 lbs. of bread
18 6i(?. ; mutton is Q^d., beef \0d. a pound. In all such instances the price in gold
units can be expressed with great accuracy ; and a slight variation of price could

give rise to no inconvenience, for the prices are pei-petuaUy fluctuating ; as they
are regulated by supply and demand, prices could be more acciu-ately adjusted and
expressed in cents than in pence. The price of 4 lbs. of bread is 6|c?., but what is
the price of 1 lb. ? That is not easily expressed. Certain articles are so constantly
associated with the penny as their price that this coin is looked upon almost as an
English institution. There is, for instance, the penny toll of some bridges, the

penny postage, and the penny newspaper, to say nothing of many other pcn^v
articles. The price is thus expressed because the penny coin exists!^ just as prices

in America are expressed in cents.

9. Eccmomies of Intel-national Coinage.

   The value of money is, like the value of all other commodities, local : 100 pieces
of gold in England may purchase a bill to entitle its owner to receive 101 or 100
pieces of the same coin in Australia. The rate of exchange where the same coins

are in use is thus expressed in the simplest manner possible. The recoo-nition of
one gold coin as the international medium of exchange gives all the contracting'

countries the same simple par. But it is different where the money units are not
the same ; there the calculations grow so intricate as to be unintelligible to the
public, and to be troublesome even to adepts. Many examples may be cited from

the pages of Mr. Tait.

Traders, if trade prices of commodities are quoted in international money and

measures, will have no difficidty in perceiving at a glance the state of the markets  '

and the cun-ents of trade.
--190 REPORT 1869.

   Travellers with international money will sustain less loss, and less discomfort
than they now encounter abroad.

   The relations between man and man will thus be enlarged and multiplied in
indefinite, proportions, when all things are measured, weighed, bought, and sold by

the same units.

                          10. The 25-franc and the 25-shiIlin(/ gold unit*.

    All the advantages of the decimal notation can be enjoyed under a gold unit of
either of these values ; but to be scientific, symmetric, international, the 2.5-franc
coin and the sovereign must consist of exactly 8 grams of gold of the same fineness,

coined under the same conditions of seigniorage. Then the after-passage from an
8-gram unit to the use of a 10-gra.m unit will be easy, and will end in a complete
identification of decimal money units with metric weights of gold, as everlasting
as the basis of the metric system. The inconvenience of the change will be real
and transitorj', but the benefit to mankind will be perpetual. By a slight sacrifice
the present generation will earn the gratitude of posterity, while it vsdll be more
than repaid for its pains in the course of two or three years of its own existence.

    In the metric measures, weights, and money, the trade of the world will enjoy

perfect instruments, facilitating the exchange of commodities as much as the steam-

engine accelerates their carriage.

      On our National Accounts. By Feank P. Fellowes, F.S.A., F.S.S.

   The paper, after detailing the steps that were being taken to carry out the re-
commendations of Mr. Seely's Committee on Admiralty Moneys and Accounts,
advocated the adoption of similar methods for other departments of Government.
These may be briefly described as having for their object, amongst other reforms,
the unification of all accounts having any relation to the Admiralty expenditure.

This paper pointed out that with the Admiralty, as with several other depart-

ments, there were three great classes of accounts. First, the estimates of money
required for the service of each department in the ensuing jeax. These estimates
are voted by the House of Commons in Committee of Supply, and they are divided

--as below : Army Estimates, Navy Estimates, Civil Service Estimates (which are

divided into seven great classes or subdivisions, called Class I. to VIL), and the
revenue departments, being Inland Revenue, Customs, Post-office, and Post-office
Packet Service. The second series of accounts are the " Appi'opriation Accounts,"

which give the money each department has received from the Treasuiy as contra-
distinguished from the money voted by the House of Commons, or, in other words,
the money the Treasury has been authorized by Parliament to expend on the
special services for which it was voted. These second series follow the order and
form of the estimates, and give in one column the money voted, and in the other
the money expended, so called, but, strictly speaking, this is only the money each
department has received from the Treasury, and it may not follow that all this has
been expended. The third series of accounts are accounts published by the various

dena'^.iients, giving detailed accoimts of the expenditure or of parts thereof, and
these the author gave the generic term of Departmental Expense Accoimts. This
paper pointed out that one of the great objects of the scheme of accoimts devised

by Mr. Seely and ]\Ir. Fellowes, which scheme is now being introduced into the

Admiralty, was the unification of these three series of accounts, and the paper ad-

vocated this for the accounts of other departments. By these means the Admiralty

estimates, though remaining in the same form as at present, so far as the order and

method in which the House of Commons voted the supplies, would be so retabu-
lated and rearranged, that in addition to showing, as now, the salaries it was in-

tended to vote, the wages, the stores proposed to be purchased, there would be
given the amount of wages required for shipbuilding and maintaining, salaries
required for superintendence and stores for this purpose, so that, in short, the
House would have before them the whole amount of the navy estimates, in divi-

--sions, as follows : Division 1, for naval yards, for shipbuilding, repairing, and main-

--sented in other coinages than the franc." Bullion and Foreign Exchanges. By Ernest

taining, then the amounts of Division 1 required for each dockyard, as A, Deptford;

B,Sheemess; C, Portsmouth; D,Devonport; E, Pembroke; F, Chatham, and so on

Di^dsion 2, Victualling the Navy ; then follow the amounts for each Victualling-
vard : Division 3, Medical ; and so on, till the whole amount of the estimates was
incorporated in these and other divisions. The appropriation accounts (series 2)

would give the same divisions, and would show the money expended, so called, as

distinguished from the money voted, so that the appropriation accounts would be

--the debtor side to the final expense accounts of 1, the cost of building, repairing,

and maintaining the fleet ; 2, the cost of victualling, and so on, so that all these ac-

Acounts would be parts of one gi'eat whole system.  similar retabulation was ad-

vocated for other departments, where practicable, so that we might have one

great account. The author also maintained that the nation ought to know the

whole value of the Governmental property of every description, land, buildings,

machinery, stock of every description, and that the increase or decrease should

be shown by each department at the end of the year. The author recognized the

labours of Sir John Bowring, Sir H. Parnell, Mr. Childers, and Mr. Stansfeld in

improving om- accounts, and urged that it was of national importance that a

thoroughly good scheme should be introduced to give the House a greater check

on expenditm-e.

   The writer alluded to a general expectation that next session some measure

of direct or indirect compulsion, as regards the education of the children of agri-

cultural labourers, would be proposed, and meet with general approval. Out
of 14,877 parishes in England and Wales the Committee of Council report that
there are only 740G which have aided schools ; that of the remainder 2779 have
schools built with State aid, but not fulfilling the conditions of annual State aid,
and described, after inspection, as generally more or less ineflicient ; while, with
regard to 4G92 parishes, nothing whatever is officially known, though there is
reason for supposing that in some of them there are good schools, in many more
schools of various degrees of inelficiency, and, in not a few, no schools at all. Canon
Girdlestone proceeded to explain the cause of this deficiency of good schools. Most
men agreed that the difliculty consists, not in the one great but isolated effort in-
volved in the first building of a school, but in the continuous eftbrt involved in the
annual maintenance of it. Canon Girdlestone stated that there can never be any

guarantee for there being an efficient school within easy access of every labourer

until the land is made to do its duty. He recommended that the children should

continue to pay a penny a week, as now, thus avoiding the risk and evil of educa-
tion becoming a pauperizing dole ; that the State grant should be distributed as

now ; that in every parish or district in which there are not at the present time

existing school-buildings in all respects satisfying the requirements of the State,

such buildings should be immediately erected with money borrowed wholly on
the parochial rates, and to be repaid, like loans from Queen Anne's Bounty for
parsonages, by equal instalments in thirty years, or partly in this way and partly
by a tax on the land. That Denison's Act should be made compulsoiy, and so
throw upon occupiers of land the charge of educating in the parochial school the
children of all receiving outdoor relief--a process which would at one and the
same time bring himdreds of idle children under education and increase the
funds of the school. And, lastly, that all that portion of school expenses which
is now defrayed by voluntary contributions should be satisfied by a tax or rate
upon the land. As regarded Devonshire, Canon Girdlestone said that there are
aided schools in little more than one-third of the parishes in that county, and
there was much reason to fear that in many of the remaining two-thirds the

--schools were chiefly inefficient, and that in some there were none at all a state of

things which contrasted unfavorably with the condition of the country at large,

bad even as that was.

194. REPORT-- 1869.

Poor-law iu Ireland till 1838. The parish vestry was found a couvenient orga-

nization in Eng-land, and a number of other rates, for purposes unconnected with

the relief of the poor, are therefore assessed and collected with the Poor-rate. In

Ireland, the parish vestry did not exist as a financial committee, and Church-

Arates were abolished iu 1833.  distinct machinery is therefore found in Ireland

for the collection of each separate tax.

   Grand-Jm-y Cess is the most important and most ancient local tax in Ireland.
Its purposes, generally speaking, con-espoud to those of the County-rate, Hun-

dred-rate, Police-rate, &c. in Eugiaud. In the earliest attempts to raise a

County-rate in Ireland the machinerj' of the parish was resorted to (11 & 12

Jac. I. c. 7), but the later enactment (10 Car. I. c. 26. sec. 2) authorized the
justices of the county to malce the rate with the assent of the Grand Jury. This rate

was substantially a copy of the English Act of 22 Hon. '^'III., with the exception

of the provision requiring the assent of the Grand Jury. This provision was the

point of departure from which the systems subsequently diverged. In 183G, Pre-

Asentment Sessions were created as a check on the grand jury.  Session is held for

each barony (a district about the size of a hundred in England), composed of the

magistrates of the county and a number of cess-payers chosen by ballot. Pre-

sentments must be passed by the Session before they are submitted to the Grand

Jury.

The late Committee of the House of Commons (18G8) on the Grand Jurv Pre-

sentments, considered the propriety of substituting elective Baronial and County

Boards for the Sessions and Grand Jury. But they have recommended the con-

tinuance of the present system with modifications, which would make the Sessions

more representative of the general body of cess-payers.

Grand-Jury Cess is applied to the purposes for which County-rate, Hundred-

rate, and Police-rate are applied in England. It also contributes to the sup-

port of fever hospitals, lunatic asylums, and reformatories, and pays the cost of

witnesses for the Crown. Some of these charities would appear more properly pay-

able out of the Poor-rate, but they were established when there was no Poor-rate in

Ireland. Tlie Committee on Grand Jury Presentments have recommended that

compensation for malicious injury (corresponding to the Hundred-rate) should be

limited in amount to £100, and tliat the holding of the injured person should bo ex-

empt from contribution. The charge of the Police or Grand-Jury Cess is now con-

fined to the cost of extra police in disturbed districts. The cost of the Irish consta-

bulary is paid out of the Consolidated Fund since 1847 ; a boon given to Ireland

as compensation for loss which it was expected would be sustained by the aboli-

tion of the Corn Laws. As to its incidence, Grand-Jury Cess is divisible into two

parts, one for general objects levied off the county, and one for objects of a more

local character levied oil" the barony. It is assessed, applotted, levied, and col-

lected by the Grand Jury and their officers, and is iu eveiy way distinct from all

other taxes. It is a first charge on the land and hereditaments, and not, like the Poor-

rate, assessed on the occupiers. The tax is, however, payable by the occupier, and

by him only, as the landlord pays no portion of it, unless he occupies the pre-

mises. The Committee of tlie House of Commons have recommended that in

future the payment of Grand-Jury Cess should be divided between the owners

and occupiers of land.

Until 1838 there was no Poor-law in Ireland. The Irish Poor-law may be

generally described as fettering its administrators more as to general outdoor

relief, and less as to medical relief, than the English Poor-law. It is payable

by the landlord and the occupier in equal portions. The electoral divisions of the

Irish Union correspond in size to the average English parish, and forms an inde-

pendent district for the purposes of assessment of the rate. Union rating, now in-

troduced into England, was the principle of the original Irish Bill, but the House

of liords substituted electoral rating.

The Acts for tlie goveruuicnt of towns are similar to the English -Vets for the

same purpose, but, in respect of many provisions, are considerably behind them.
Two important steps towards consolidation have lately been made in Ireland. In

the counties of the cities of Dublin, Limerick, and Cork, the powers of Grand

Juries of the city taxation have been transferred to the Corporations, and the im-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                              195

portant town of Belfast has been separated from tlie counties of Antrim and
Down, and a like transfer lias been effected. Also in Dublin there is now a Col-
lector-General, who collects by quarterly instalments, and in one bulk sum, the
entire of those rates for which the citizens are liable.

   In Ireland there are four systems of audit of local taxation. The GJraud Jury
expenditure is audited by the Judge of Assize as to points of law, and by the Re-
ceiver Master in Chancery as to matters of accoimt. The Poor-law taxation of
£600,000 is audited as to points of law by the Poor-law Commissioners, and as to

matters of account by auditors appointed by them. Town Councils and other

municipal bodies are under no system of audit as to points of law, such points

being only determinable by a Chancery suit, as in the case of Belfast. The only
audit of municipal accounts is performed by auditors selected by the ratepayers
and Town Council or Commissioners. TJie audit best adapted for municipal ac-
counts would be a combination of the Poor-law and Grand Jury sj'stems. As

to the question of the legality of the rate or expenditure, the best audit is that

enjoyed by the Grand Jury accounts, viz. by the Judge of Assize in the case of
Assize towns, or of the County Courts in other cases. As to the final audit, the
Conuuittee recommend the Poor-law system.

   The valuation for all local rates levied in Ireland is the same, and amounted,
in 1865, to £12,986,026, giving for Grand-Jury Cess an average of Is. l^d. in the
pound, and Poor-rate Is. \^d., which make a total average of 2s. Q\cl. The average
town rate is about 2s. Id. in the poimd.

  On tlie Examination Suhjecfs for Admission into tlie College for Women at
                          Hitcliin. By J. Hetwood, F.M.S.

   This institution is designed to hold in relation to girls' schools and home teaching

a position analogous to that occupied by the universities towards the public schools
for boj-s. It is proposed to raise the sum required for building and preliminaiy
expenses by public subscription and by the sale of a limited number of presentations.
The building had been provided, the students' fees will be hxed on such a scale as

to secure that the institution shall bo self-supporting. At an examination held at
the University of London in July last, twelve ladies out of seventeen passed ; and

the College will be opened, under the direction of Mrs. Manning, on October 16th
next. The whole course will occupy three years. There will be three terms a
year ; the charge for board, lodging, and instruction will he £35 per term, paid in
advance. Efforts will be made to obtain for the students admission to the exa-
mination for degrees of the University of Cambridge, and generally to place the
College in connexion with that University. Religious instruction and services are
in accordance with the principles of the Church of England, but the attendance of
students to them is not enforced.

              Oti Naval Finance. By E. Main (0/ the Admiralti/).

   The object of this paper was to show how the cost of the Navy had increased in

the last twenty years. Dining' the last twenty years the naval system of this
cnnntr}^ had nndergone no great change, thongh considerable changes had been
introdnced both into the construction of men-of-war and the manning- of the Navj'.

These changes had greatly increased naval expenditure but, in addition, the Navy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

was much larger now than it was twent}' j'ears ago. In that period a Naval

[Reserve had been added, a Channel squadroai maintained, the Const-guard trans-

ferred from the Customs to the Nav}', and the force of men kept in permanent
reser^'e at the different ports, to man ships immediately they were commissioned,
considerably increased. These additions to tlie material strength of the Navy
amounted alone to nearly two millions sterling ; and by cutting any of them off" a
great reduction could certainly be effected. 15ut these additions had been made at
the express demand of the country, to meet needs which existed as much now as
twentj^ years ago. Then several alterations, of an expensive character, had been
made, which had increased the cost of the Navy, since 1849, by about £1,700,000.
These were the increase of pay to nearly every class of officers and seamen, which
had been carried to such an extent that every officer cost, on an average, about £60
a year more than in 1849, and every seaman more than £10. Food was dearer
now than then, and was better in quality, and more liberally bestowed ; so that,
while the average cost of each man for provisions, &c. was £14 10s. in 1849, it was
now £18. In addition to these expensive alterations were the improvements in the
dockyards and in administration generally. It was difficult to see how any very
extensive reductions could be made in this branch of expenditure unless the Navy
was reduced to a much smaller size than it was twenty years ago. It is, however,

in this branch that the present reductions have been chiefly carried out ; but it has
required a public spii-it and determination of no ordinary character in the present
Board of Admiralty to effect here a reduction of even £100,000. Lastly, the

increased use of steam in the Navy and the substitution of iron for wooden men-of-
war have increased the cost of the Navy now as compared -with 1849 by £800,000.
Thus, altogether, the increased cost of the Navy in 1868 as compared with 1849,
which is about four millions and a half sterling, has been accounted for.

      On Assisted Emigration. By Dr. E. J. Mann, F.E.A.S., F.B.6.S.

   The object of this paper was to show that the most promising course in organizing

a sj'stem of assisted emigration is to provide suitable grants of land in the colonies

for selected and well-qualitied emigrants, and to give them advances of such means
as may be found indispensable to secure them a start in getting a living by the
cultivation of their grants, requiring them to repay such sums within a ffxed
period by easy annual instalments, and holding their land in security until the

repayments have been completed. An instance was adduced in illustration of the

practicability of such a system, in which thirty-five German families had been sent
out to a colony (the colony of Natal), and settled upon the land. These people were
embarked in the j'ear 1847, and were entirely without means ; and were nearly all of
them weavers, and destitute of the most important knowledge of agi-icultural opera-
tions. Yet when the author of this notice visited their settlement, which he did

eighteen years subsequently, he found each family in possession of a valuable little
estate cffrom 1.50 to :200 acres of land, which had been purchased at the rate of from
los. to 30.>'. an acre, and paid for, and with accumulated property in almost every in-
stance amounting to, and in some instances exceeding, £800. There can be no possible
doubt that, under a well-conceived and well-managed system, it would be found
that thrifty and industrious English, Scotch, and Irish farm-labourers, initiated in
the mysteries of the spade and plough, would be able readily to accomplish, at least,

as much as was done in that instance by German weavers not having the same
special and technical qualifications. Details were then given to show how a
capital of £50,000 might be made available in perpetuity to transport and start 500

families, comprising 2500 individuals, to and in a colony lilce Natal, and then to
add to them fifty other families, comprising 250 individuals, eveiy year. It was
shown that such a proceeding would alike benefit the community from which the
TRANSACTIOXS OF THE SECTIONS.  197

emigrants were takeii, and the colonial community to which they were added; and
that it would confer an addition upon the public revenue of the colony, through
indirect contributions, of some £4-5,000 within a period of ten years. It was also
pointed out that the colony of Natal was eminently adapted for such a course of
action, by the abundance of available laud in open pasture ready for the plough, by
the mildness of its climate, by the cheapness of the necessaries of life, by the
large range of natural productions, stretching through sugar, coflee, tobacco, cotton,

silk, horses, cattle, sheep, wool, root-crops, and grain-crops of nearly every variety,
and by the abundance and cheapness of native labour.

Statistical JVotes on some Experiments in Agriculture. By Frederick Puedy,

         F.S.S., Principal of the Statistical Department, Poor-Law Board.

  The memoranda of the plan and results, which Mr. Lawes has circulated among his
friends, give the issue of upwards of 1400 separate experiments, not experiments

that can be quickly performed like the ordinary ones of the laboratory, but experi-
ments each requiring one revolution of the seasons for its answer*. It is beyond

my scope to attempt a description of these researches in any detail ; at the same

time I hope to convey some idea of the extreme importance of Mr. Lawes's achieve-
ments, by selecting a few salient examples from each process of cultivation employed

--by that gentleman.

 On the Population and Mortality of Bombay, derived from the last Census,

    and the Reports of the Health OJ/icers of Bombay to the latest dates. By

    P. M. Taix, F.S.S., F.R.G.S.

    To Sir Bartle Frero, late Governor of Bombay, and Dr. Leitli we are mainly-
 indebted for the census taken in 18(34. Bombay is the second city, in point of

 population, in the British Empire, the numbers being S1G,5G2, or very nearly a

 million, of whom Brahmins, or professing Brahminical creed, are about 71 per

 cent. ; Mahomedans, 18 per cent. ; Zoroastrians, G per cent. ; Clivistians, only
 .3'o4 per cent. ; Bhuddists, 1 per cent. ; and the remainder Jews and other races.
 There are 18-5 males to every 100 females, the proportion of the sexes up to the age
 of 13 being nearly equal. Nearly one-fourth of the whole population are unskilled
 labourers. Of the Brahmins one-third are beggars, and only 2 per cent, teachers or
 schoolmasters, while amongst the 50,000 Parsees there is not one beggar or
 mendicant. Caste appears to have little influence in determining the occupation
oi the Hindoo population. The proportion of the population born in Europe is only
six in every 1000. Tliese figures are necessary to gi\e any solution to the results

given in the health officers' reports, which are made up to the end of June 1869. The
most remarkable fact in connexion with the mortality of Bombay is, that more than
one-half of the total casualties are caused by zymotic diseases of the miasmatic order

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

that is to say, are consequent on defective drainage, impure water, absence of
ventilation, and the unclean habits of the community. In Calcutta the chief scourge

is, as a rule, cholera ; in Bombay, fever. The sea-water invades certain portions of
the island of Bombay, turns some acres into a salt swamp, penetrates into the
drains, and thus distributes the efliuvium fiu- and wide. The mortality from fe\-er
is at the minimum during the monsoon months, when the drains throughout the
native town are well scoured by tlie rains ; while the sudden rise in the deaths
from smallpox is coincident with the time of the influx of Mahomedan pilgrims to
Bombay, for the purposes of the Haj. Upon the whole, Bombay is healthier than

Calcutta, so f;ir as the figures iu the paper carry us, the deaths in the latter during

18(36 having been -17 per IGOO, while at Bombay they were only 21 per 1000, and
iu 1807 19 per 1000. The tejuperature was referred to : and as to rainfalls, there

are 80^- inches in Bonibay to Go-} in Calcutta. During July 1867 the rainfall at
the former place was 37 inches. Tin; paper, which will be published in the Journal
of the East Indian Association, concluded by fully recognizing the exertions, under

extraordinaiy dillicidties, of I\Ir. Crawford, the municipal commissioner of Bombaj-,
Dr. A. II. Leith, and Dr. T. G. Hewlett, in the interest of sanitary reform, and by

declaring that, with an improved conservancy, Bombay could, it is believed, be
made as healthy a town for Englishmen to li\e in as cities of similar size on the

continent of Europe.

On the Method of Teachiny rhysiccd Science. By the Eev. W. Ttjckwell.

--The author sot forth the leading subjects to be tauglit, viz. experimental

mechanics, chemistry, systematic botany and pliysiology. But this last depended

on the period to which school education ^vas protracted. The time to be gi\-en to

science should not be less than three hours a week                                                                                                                                                                                                                               at this rate two years might be

playground there should be a botanic garden.

         Address hy C. "NVilliaji Siemens, F.li.S., President of the Section.

In addressing you from this Chair, I feel that I have accepted a task which, how-
ever liatteriug, I should have hesitated to undertake, had I not every reason to
rely on j^our forbearance, and upon the friendly support of those senior members

of our profession who by their attendance at these annual gatherings give weight

and importance to our proceedings. I also greatly depend on the cooperation of
those Members of the British Association who, although devoted chiefly to the
cultivation of pure science, are nevertheless e^'er ready to assist us in our endea-
vours to apply that science to practical ends.

    It is by submitting such subjects as -^^-ill be brought before us to the double

touchstone of science and of practical experience that we shall be able to appre-

ciate real merit, and at the same time assist the authors of the several papers, b)' a
confirmation or rectification of their views; thus redeeming our proceedings from
the adherent disadvantage of lack of time to give that fall and patient attention
which the authors might meet with in bringing their subjects before the purely
professional Institutions of Civil Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, or Naval

Architects.

    In prefacing our proceedings with a few remarks on the leading subjects of the
day of special interest to om- section, I can scarcely pass over the popular question

of technical education.

   The Great International Exhibitions proved that, although England still holds
her ground as the leading manufacturing country-, the nations of the Continent have
made great strides to dispute her preeminence in several branches, a result which
is generally ascribed to their superior system of technical education. Those desi-
rous of obtaining a clear insight into that system, and the vast scale upon which it
is being carried out under Government supervision, cannot do better than read
Mr. John Scott Iiussell's very able volume on this subject : they will no doubt
agree with the author in the necessity of energetic steps being taken in this country
to promote the work of universal education, although I for one think that objection
may fiiirly be made against the plan of merely imitating the example of our

neighbours.

   The pol3'technic schools of the Continent, not satisfied to impart to the technical
student a good know ledge of mathematics and of natural sciences, pretend also to
superadd the practical information necessar}^ to constitute them engineers or manu-

facturers.

   This practical information is conveyed to them by professors lacking themselves
practical experience, and tends to engender in the students a dogmatical conceit
which is likely to stand in the way of originnlity in the adaptation of new means
to new ends in their future career. On this account I should prefer to see a sound

" fundamental " education, comprising mathematics, dynamics, chemistn-, geology,
and physical science, with a sketch onh' of the technical arts, followed up by
professional training such as can only be obtained in the workshop, the office, or
the field.

   The universal interest evinced throughout the country in the work of education
by parliamentary inquiries, by the erection of colleges and professorships, and by
the munificence of a leading member of our Section in endowing a hundred scholar-
ships, are proofs that England intends to hold her place also in this question of

education amongst the civilized nations ; and I am confident that she will accom-

plish this object in a manner in unison with her practical tendencies and indepen-

dence of character.
           TRANSACTION'S 01' THE SECTIONS.  201

Closely allied to the question of education is that of the system of Letters Pa-

Atent.     patent is, accordiii<>- to modern views, a contract bet\yeen the common-

wealth and an individual who has discovered a method peculiar to himself of accom-

plishing' a result of n-eneral utility. The State, beini;- interested to secure the in-

formation and to induce the inventor to put his discovery into execution, grants

him the exclusive right of practising it, or of authorizing others to do so, for a

limited number of years, in consideration of his making a full and sufficient de-

scription of the same. Unfortunately this simple and equitable theory of the patent

system is very imperfectly carried out, and is beset with various objectionable prac-

tices, which render a patent sometimes an impediment to, rather than a furtherance

of, applied science, and sometimes involve tlie author of an invention in endless

legal contentions and disaster, instead of procuring for him the intended reward.

These evils are so great and palpable that many persons, including men of un-

doubted sincerity and sound judgment on most subjects, advocate the entire abo-

lition of the Patent Laws. They argue that the desire to publish the results of

our mental labour suffices to ensure to the commonwealth the possession of all new

discoveries and inventions, and that justice might be done to meritorious inventors

by giving them national rewards.

This argument may hold good as regards a scientific discovery, where the labour

bestowed is purely mental, and can-ies with it the pleasurable excitement peculiar

to the exercise and advancement of science on the part of the devotee ; but a prac-

tical invention has to be regarded as the result of a first conception elaborated

by experiments, and applied to existing proces.ses in the face of practical dif-

ficulties, of prejudice, and of various discouragements, involving also great expen-

diture of time and money, which no man can well afford to give away; nor can
men of merit be expected to advocate their cause before the national tribunal of

rewards, where at best only very narrow and imperfect ^iews of the ultimate im-

portance of a new invention A\-ould be taken, not to speak of the favouritism to

which the doors would be thrown open. Practical men would midoubtedly pre-

fer eitlier to exercise tlieir inventions in secret, where tliat is possible, or to desist

from following up their ideas to the point of their practical realization. If we

review the progress of the technical arts of our time, we may trace important prac-

tical inventions almost without exception to the Patent Office. In cases where the

inventor of a machine, or process, happened to belong to a nation without an effi-

cient patent law, we find that he readily transferred the scene of his activity to

the country ofiering him the greatest encouragement, there to swell the ranks of
intelligent workers. Whether we loolc upon tlie powerful appliances that fashion

shapeless masses of iron and steel into railway wheels or axles, or into the more

delicate parts of machiney, whether we look upon the complex machinery in our

cotton-factories, our print-works, aiul paper-mills, or into a Birmingham manu-

factory, where steel pens, buttons, pins, buckles, screws, pencil-cases, and otlier

objects of general utility are produced by carefully elaborated machinery at an

extremely low cost, or whether we look upon our agricultural machinery by which

England is enabled to compete without protection against the Itussian orDanubian

agriculturist, with cheap labour and cheap land to back him, in nearly all cases

we find that the machine has been designed and elaborated in its details by a pa-
tentee who did not rest satisfied till he had persuaded the manufacturers to adopt

the same, and had removed all their real or imag-inary objections to tlie innovation.

We also find that tlie knowledge of its construction reaches the public direct^ or

indirectly through tlie Patent Office, thus enlarging the basis for further inventive

progress.

  The greatest illustration of the beneficial working of the Patent Laws was sup-

plied, in my opinion, by James Watt when, just 100 hundred years ago, he pa-

tented his invention of a hot working-cylinder and separate steam-engine condenser.

After years of contest against those adverse circumstances that beset everv im-
portant innovation, James Watt, with failing health and scanty means, was only

upheld in his struggle by the deep conviction of the ultimate triumph of his cause.
This conviction gave him coniidence to enlist the cooperation of a second capitalist
after the first had fidled him, and of asking for an extension of his declining patent.

   Without this opportune help Watt could not have succeeded in maturing his in-
203 REPORT-- 1869.

veution. lie would in all probability liave relapsed into tbe mere instrument-
maker, -with broken health and broken heart, and the introduction of the steam-
enr;-ine would not only have been retarded for a generation or two, but its iinal
progress would have been based probably upon the coarser conceptions of Papin,
bavorv, and Newconien.

   It can easily be shown that the perfect conception of the physical nature of steam,
which dwelt, like a Meaveu-born inspiration, in ^^'att"s mind, was neither imder-
stood by his contemporaries nor by his followers up to very recent times, nor can
it be gathered from "S'S'att's imperfect specitication. James "Watt was not satis-
fied in excluding the condensing-water from his^workiug-cylinder, and suiTOimdiug
the same by non-conducting substances, but he placed beween the cylinder and the
non-conductiug envelope a source of heat in the form of a steam-jacket, tilled with
steam at a pressure somewhat superior to that of the working steam. His imme-
diate successors not only discarded the .steam-jacket, and even condemned it on the
superficial plea that the jacket presented a larger and hotter surface for loss by ra-
diation than the cylinder, but expansive working was actually rejected by some of
them on the ground that no practical advantage could be obtained by it.

   The modern engine, notwithstanding our perfected means of construction, had
in fact degenerated in many instances into a virtual steam-meter, constructed ap-
parently with a A'iew of emptying the Isoiler in the shortest possible space of time.

    It is only during the last twent}' or thirty years that the subtile action of satu-

rated steam, in condensing upon the sides of the cylinder when imder pressure,

and of reevaporating M-hen the pressure is relieved towards the end of each stroke,

has been again recognized aud insisted upon by I.e C'hatelier and others, who have
shown the necessity of a slightly superheated cylinder, in order to realize the ex-

pansive force of steam.

   The result has been a reduction in the consumption of fuel in our best marine
engines from G or 8 to below 3 lbs. per gross indicated horse-power.

    It is a hopeful circumstance that, during the next Session of Parliament, the

whole question of the Patent Laws is likely to be inquired into by a Special Com-

mittee, who, it is to be hoped, will act decisively in the general interest, without

being influenced by special or professional claims. They will have it in their power

to render the Patent Office an educationfxl institution of Ihc highest order.
   In viewing the latest achievements of engineering science, two works strike the

imagination chiefly by their exceeding magnitude, and by the influence they are
likely to exercise upon the traffic of the world. The tirst of these is the Great
Pacific Railway, which, in passing through vast regions hitherto inaccessible to
civilized man, and over formidable mountain-chains, joins California with the
Atlantic States of the gTeat American Ecpublic. The second is the Suez Ship-
ping Canal, w^iich, notwithstanding adverse prognostications and serious diffi-
culties, will be opened veiy shortly to the commerce of the world. These works
must greatly extend the range of commercial enterprise in the Xorth Pacific and

Indian Seas. The new waterway to India will, owing to the difficult navigation
of the Red Sea, be in effect only available for ships propelled by steam, and will

give a stimulus to that l)ranch of engineering.

   Telegi-aph communication with America has been rendered more secure against

interruption bv the successful submersion of the French Transatlantic Cable. On

the other hand, telegraphic communication with India still remains in a very un-

satisfactory condition, owing to imperfect lines and divided administration. To
supply a remedy for this puljlic evil, the Indo-European Telegraph Company will

shortly open its special lines for Indian correspondence. In jN'ortheru Russia the
construction of a land line is far advanced to connect St. Petersburgh with the

mouth of the Amour River, on completion of which only a submarine link between

the Aniom- and San Francisco will be wanting, to complete the telegi-aphic gii'dle
round the earth.

   AVith these great highways of speech once established, a network of submarine
and aerial wires will soon follow to bind all inhabited portions of our globe toge-
ther into a closer community of interests, which, if followed up by steam comnui-
uication by land and )5y sea, will open out a great and meritorious field for the
activity of the civil aud the mechanical engineer.

   But while pToat ^TOlks have to he carried out in distant parts, still more remains
to be accomplished nearer home. The railway of to-da}- has not only taken the
place of high roads and canals, for the transmission of p'oods and passengers be-
tween our g-reat centres of industry and population, but is already superseding' Ijy-

roads leading; to places of inferior importance ; it competes with the mule in car-
rying minerals oyer mountain-passes, and with the omnibus in our great cities.
If a ri-\-er cannot be spanned by a bridge without hindering nayigation, a tunnel is

forthwith in contejnplation ; or, if that should not be practicaljle, the transit of
trains is yet accomplished by the establishment of a large steam-ferry.

   It is one of the questions of the day to decide by which plan the British Channel
should be crossed, to relieve the unfortunate traveller to the Continent of the ex-
ceeding discomfort and delay inseparable from the existing most imperfect arrange-

ments. Considering that this question has now been taken up by some of our
leading engineers, and is also entertained by the two interested governments, wo
may look forward to its speedy and satisfactory solution.

    So long as the attention of railway engineers was confined to the construction of
main lines, it was necessary for them to provide for a hea\-y traffic and high speeds,
and these desiderata are best met by a level permanent way, by easy curves and
heavy rails of the strongest possible materials, namely, cast steel ; but in extending
the system to the corners of the earth, cheapness of construction and mainte-
nance, for a moderate speed and a moderate amount of traflic, become a matter of

necessity.

   Instead of plunging through hill and mountain, and of crossing and recrossing
rivers by a series of monumental works, the modern railway passes in zigzag up
the steep incline and conforms to the windings of the narrow gorge; it can only
be worked by light rolling-stock of flexible construction, lurnished with increased
power of adhesion and great bralie-power. Yet by the nid of the electric telegraph,

in regulating the progress of each train, the number of trains may be so increased

as to produce nevertheless a large aggregate of trafiic, and it is held by some that
even our trunk lines vrould be worked more advantageously by light rolling-stock.

the time being into a pump forcing steam and water into its own boiler. It is

difficult to overestimate the beneficial efi'ects likely to result from this invention.

While the extension of communication occupies the attention of perhaps the

greater number of our engineers, others are engaged upon weapons of oftensive and
Wedefensive warfare.
                                                                 have scarcely recovered our wonder at the terrific destruc-

tion dealt by the Armstrong gun, the Whitworth bolt, or the steel barrel conso-

lidated under Krupp's gigantic steam hammer, when we hear of a shield of such
Asolidity and toughness as to bid defiance to them all.
                                                                                                                  larger gun or a harder

bolt by Palliser or Griison is the successful answer to this challenge, when ao-ain

defensive jdating, of greater tenacity to absorb the power residing in the shot, or
of such imposing weight and hardness combined as to resist the projectile absolutely

(causing it to be broken up by the force residing -within itself) is brought forward.

   The ram of war with heavy iron sides, which a few years since was thoua'ht the
most formidable, as it certainl)' was the most costly weapon ever devised, is already
being superseded by vessels of the " Captain type " as designed by Captain Coles,

and carried out by ^lessrs. Laird Brothers, with turrets (armed with guns by

Anustrong of gigantic power) that resist the heaviest firing, both on account of
their extraordinary thickness, and of the angular direction in which the shot is

likelj' to strike.

   By an ingenious device Captain Moncreiff lowers his gun upon its rocking car-

riage after firing, and thereby does away with embrasures (the weak places in
protecting works), while at the same time he gains the advantage of reloadino- his
gun in comparative safety.

It is presumed that in thus raising formidable engines of offensive and defensive

warfare the civilized nations of the earth will pause before puttino- them into earnest

operation                                                        but, if they should do so, it is consolatory to  think that they coidd not

work them for long without eftecting the total exhaustion of their treasuries, already

drained to the utmost in their construction.
204 KEPOKT-- 1869.

   While science and meclianical skill combine to produce these wondrous results,
the germs of furtlier and still greater achievements are matured in our mechanical
workshops, in our forg-es, and in our metallurgical smelting works ; it is there that
the materials of construction are prepared, refined, and put into such forms as to
render greate]- and still greater ends attainable. Here a great revolution of our
constructive art has been prepared by the production, in large quantities and at
moderate cost, of a material of more than twice the strength of iron, which, instead
of being fibrous, has its full strength in every dii'ection, and which can be modu-
lated to every degree of ductility, approaching the hardness of the diamond on the
one hand, and the proverbial toughness of leather on the other. To call this ma-
terial cast steel seems to attribute to it brittleness and uncertainty of temper, which,
however, are by no means its necessary characteristics. This new nuiterial, as
prepared for constructive purposes, may indeed be both hard and tough, as is illus-
trated by the hard steel rope that has so materially contributed to the practical

success of steam ploughing.

   Machinery-steel has gradually come into use since about ISoO, when Ivj'upp of
Essen commenced to supply large ingots that were shaped into railway tyres, axles,

cannon, &c., by melting steel in halls containing hundreds of melting-crucibles.
   The Bessemer process, in dispensing with the process of puddling, and in uti-

lizing the carbon contained in the pig-iron to effect the fusion of the final metal,
has given a vast extension to the application of cast steel for railway bars, &c.

    This process is limited, however, in its application to superior brands of pig-iron,

containing much carbon and no sulphur or phosphorus, which latter impurities are
so destructive to the quality of steel. The puddling process will still have to be
resorted to, unless the process of decarburization proposed by Mr. Ileaton should
be able to compete with it, to purify these inferior pig-irons which constitute the

bulk of our productions, and the puddled iron cannot be brought to the condition
of cast steel except through the process of fusion. This fusion is accomplished
successfully in masses of from three to five tons on the open bed of a regenerative

gas furnace at the Landore Siemens-Steel "Works and at other places. At the same

works cast steel is also produced, to a limited extent as yet, from iron ore which,
being operated upon in large masses, is reduced to the metallic state and liquified
by the aid of a certain proportion of pig metal. The regenerative gas furnace, the
application of which to glass-houses, to forges, iSrc, has made considerable progress,
is unquestionably well suited for their operations, because it combines an intensity
of heat limited only by the point of fusion of the most refractory material, with
extreme mildness of draught and chemical neutrality of flame.

   These and other processes of recent origin tend towards the production at a com-
paratively cheap rate of a very high-class material that must shortly supersede iron
for almost all structural puiijoses. As yet engineers hesitate, and very properly so,
to construct their bridges, their vessels, and their rolling-stock[of the'materiarpro-
duced by these processes, becau.se no exhaustive experiments have been published

as yet fixing the limit to which they may safely be loaded in extension, in com-

pression, and in torsion, and because no sufficient information has been obtained
regarding the tests by which their quality can best be ascertained.

   This great want is in a fair way of being supplied by the experimental researches
that have been carried on for some time at Her Majesty's Dockyard at AVoolwich

under a committee appointed for that purpose by tlie Institute of Civil Engineers.
In the mean time excellent service has been rendered by Mr. Kirkaldy in giving
us, in a perfectly reliable manner, the resisting-power and ductility of any sample

of material which we wish to submit to his tests.
   The residts of Mr. '\\ liitworth's experiments, tending to render the hammer and

the rolls partly mmecessary, by consolidating cast steef while in a semifiuid state,
in strong iron moulds, by hydraulic pressure, are looked upon with general interest.

   But, assuming that the new material has been reduced to the utmost degi-ee of

uniformity and cheapness, and that its limits of strength are fidly ascertained,
there remains still the task for the ci^ il and mechanical engineer to-prepare designs
suitable for the development of its peculiar qualities. If, in constructing a girder,
for example, a design were to be adopted that had been worked out for iron, and
if all the scantlings were simply reduced in the inverse proportion of the absolute
Tll.VNSACTIOXS OF THE SECTION'S.                                       20o

and relative .strengtli of the new material as compared witli irou, sucli a girder

would assm'edly collapse when the test-weight was applied, for the simple reason

that the reduced sectional area of each part, in proportion to its length, would be

insufficient to give stilihess. You might as well almost take a design for a wooden

structure and carry it out in iron by simply reducing the section of each part. The

advantages of using the stronger material become most apparent if applied, for in-

stance, to large bridges, where the principal strain upon each part is produced by

the weight of the structure itself; for, supposing that the new material can be

safely weighted to double the bearing strain of iron, and that the weight of the

structure were reduced to one-half accordingly, there would still remain a largo

excess of available strength, in consequence of the reduced total weight, and this

would justify a further reduction of the amount of the material employed. In con-

structing works in foreign parts, the reduced cost of carriage furnishes also a pow-

erful argument in fa\our of the stronger material, although its first cost per ton

might largely exceed that of iron.

The inquiries of the Koyal Coal Commission into the extent and management

of our coal-fields appear to be reassuring as regards the danger of their becoming

soon exhausted ; nevertheless, the importance of economising these precious de-

posits in the production of steam-power in metallurgical operations and in domes-

tic use can hardly be over-estimated. The calorific power residing in a pound of

coal of a given analysis can now be accurately expressed in units of heat, which

again are represented by equivalent units of force or of chemical action ; therefore,

if we ascertain the consumption of coal of a steam-engine or of a furnace employed

in metallurgical operations, we are able to tell, by the light of physical science,

what proportion of the heat of combustion is utilized and what pi'oportion is lost.

Having arrived at this point we can also trace the channels through which loss

takes place, and in diminishing these, by judicious improvement, we shall more

and more approach those standards of ultimate perfection which we can never

reach, but which we should nevertheless keep stedfastly before our eyes. Thus

a pound of ordinary coal is capable of producing 12,000 (Fahrenheit) units of heat,

which equal 9,240,000 foot-lbs. or imits of force, whereas the ^-ery best perform-

ances of our pumping engines do not exceed the limit of 1,000,000 foot-lbs. of

force per pound of coal consumed. In like manner 1 lb. of coal should be capable

of heating -33 lbs. of iron to the welding-point (of, say, o000° Fahrenheit), whereas,

in an ordinary furnace, not 2 lbs. of iron are so heated with 1 lb. of coal. These

figures serve to show the great field for further improvement that lies yet before us.

Although heat may be said to be the moving principle by which all things in

nature are accomplished, an excess of it is not only hurtful to some of our processes,

such as brewing, and destnictive to our nutriments, but to those living in hot

climates, or sitting in crowded rooms, an excess of temperature is fully as great a

Whysource of discomfort as excessive cold can be.  then, may I ask, should we not

resoii; largely to refrigeration in summer as well as to calorihcation in winter, if it

can be shown that the one can be done at nearly the same cost as the other ? So long

as we rely for refrigeration upon our ice-cellars, or upon importation of ice from

distant parts, we shall have to look upon it as a costly luxury only; but by the

use of properlv constructed machines, it will be possible, I believe, to produce re-

Afrigeration at an extremely moderate expenditure of fuel and labour.  machine

has already been constructed capable of producing 9 lbs. of ice (or its equivalent)

for 1 lb. of coal, whereas the equivalent values of positive heat developed in the

combustion of 1 lb. of coal and of negative heat residing in 1 lb. of ice is about as

12,000 to 170, or as 1 to 70. This result already justifies the employment of refri-

gerating machines upon a large scale ; but it is hard to say what practical results
may yet be reached with an improved machine on strictly dynamical principles,

because such a machine seems not to he tied in its results to any definite theoretical

limits. In changing, for example, a pound of water from liquid into the gaseous

state, a given number of units of heat are required, that may be produced by the

combustion of coal or by the expenditure of force ; but in changing the same

pound of water into ice, heat is not lost but gained in the operation, which heat

must be traceable to another part of the machine, either as sensible heat or as

developed force, It would lead me too far to enter here into particulars on this
206 REPOKT-- 1869.

question, which is one not without interest for the physicist and the meclianical

eno-ineer.

   There are several other subjects I should liave gladly mentioned were I not
afraid of encroaching undulj' upon our time ; some of these "will, however, be brought
before the Section in the form of distinct papers, and will, I trust, lead to inter-

esting discussions.

Description of a proposed Cast-Iron Tuhe for carryinri a Railway aci'oss the

   Channel between the Coasts of England and France. By John Frederic

   Bateman, F.B.S., M.Inst.O.E., and Julian John Eevt, M.Inst.C.E.,

     Vienna.

The advantages which would accrue from a continuous railway communication

between England and France are great beyond any possibility of estimate.

   From time to time various proposals for effecting this object have been before

--the public by a tunnel to be driven beneath the bed of the sea, through the chalk,
-- --which is supposed to be continuous by submerged roadways and tubes by large
--ferry-boats carrying trains on board and by bridges to be carried on piers formed

on islands to be sunk in the Straits. To the latter proposition there are so many

obvious objections, that it is hardly necessary to discuss its practicability.

  A large ferry-boat, of great length and breadth, large enough to receive a whole

ordinary train on board, and driven at high speed by powerful engines, would

unquestionably be a material improvement upon the present miserable means of

conveyance. Such boats cannot, however, be employed, except \)j the construction

of special harbours on each coast, which would be works of difficulty and expense.

However successfully such a scheme might be worked out, the anno5'ance attending

a sea-passage in rough weather, althougli mitigated, would not be removed ; and

it would frequently occur in the course of the year that tlie traffic would be inter-

rupted by fogs and bad weather. Under any circumstances ferry-boats across the

channel would be very far from a complete and perfect railway communication.

With reference to a tunnel, it has been proposed to drive one of ordinaiy size

for a double line of railway, which shall descend by a gradient of 1 in GO on each

side of the channel to a depth of about 270 feet below the bed of the sea. The

total length of the tunnel would be thirty miles, of which twenty-two would be

beneath the sea.

The uncertainty of the strata in the bed of the channel, and the dangers to which

any tunnelling operations for some twenty miles under the sea would be subject in

the event of meeting Avith open stratification or dislocated material, are such as

would in all probability deter capitalists from entering on so hazardous an enter-

prise, and would baffle and overpower both engineering skill and all mechanical

appliances. Still the project of a tunnel is entertained and advocated by engineers

of great standing and reputation, and must only be discarded on a better system

being proved to be available.

The distance to be crossed, and the cost to be incuiTcd, require that the mode to

be adopted shall be absolutely free from serious doubt and risk, and shall be as

evidently capable of accomplishment as the most ordinary mechanical operation.

Some degree of uncertainty must exist in every contri^'ance and speculation ; but,

unless a scheme can be proposed which will be free from all doubt and objection
so far as human knowledge and foresight can extend, it will hardly deserve, and

will probably not receive, the support of the public.

Our object has been to devise a scheme bj' which all difficulties of operating ia

Wewater should be avoided.     propose to lay a tube of cast-iron on the bottom of

the sea, between coast and coast, to be commenced on one side of the channel, and

to be built up within the inside of a horizontal cylinder, or bell, or chamber, which

shall be constantly pushed forward as the building up of the tube proceeds. The

bell or chamber within which the tube is to be constructed will be about 80 feet

in length, 18 feet internal diameter, and composed of cast-iron rings 8 inches

thick, securely bolted together. The interior of the bell will be bored out to a true

cylindrical surface like the inside of a steam cylinder. The tube to be constructed
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                207

Avitliiu it will consist of cast-iron plates in segiiients 4 inches in thickness, connected

by flanges, bolted tog-ether inside the tube, leaving- a clear diameter of 13 feet when

finished. Surrounding- this tube and forming part of it, ^\·ill be constructed annular

disks or diaphragms, the outside circumference of which will accui-ately tit the

interior of the bell. These diaphragms will be furnished with arrangenients for

making- perfectly watertight joints for the piu-pose of excluding sea-water and

secm-ing a dry chamber, within which the various operations for building up the

tube, and for pressing forward the bell as each ring of the tube is added, will bo

performed. There will always be three and generallj- four of these waterti"-ht
Ajoints contained within the bell.
                                    clear space between the end of the tube and the

end or projecting part of the bell, of 30 feet, will be left as a chamber for the various

operations, "\^"ithin this chamber, powerful hydraulic presses, using the built and

completed portion of the tube as a fulcrum, will, as each ring is completed, push

forward the bell to a sufficient distance to admit the addition of another ring to

the tube. The bell will slide over the watertight joints described, one of which

will be left behind as the bell is projected forward, leading three always in operation

against the sea. The weight of the bell and of the machinerj' within it will be a

little in excess of the weight of water displaced, and therefore the only resistance

to be overcome by the hydraulic presses when pushing forward the "bell, is the

friction due to the slight ditterence in weight and the head or column of water

pressing upon the sectional area of the bell against its forward motion. In like

juanner, the specific gravity of the tube will be a little in excess of the weight of
water which it displaces; and in order to obtain a, lirm footing upon the bottom of

the sea, the tube will be weighted by a lining of brick in cement, and for further

protection will be tied to the ground by screw piles, which will pass through

stuffing boxes in the bottom of the tube. These piles will, during the construction

of the tube within the bell-chamber, be introduced in the annular space between

the outside of the tube and the inside of the bell, and will be screwed into the

ground as they are left behind by the progTession of the bell. The hydraulic

presses and the other hydraulic machinery, which will be employed for lifting and

fixing the various segments of the tube, will be supplied with tlie power required
for working them from accumidators on shore, on Sir William Armstrongs system,

and the supply of fresh air required for the sustenance of the workmen employed

within the bell and within the tube will be insured also by steam power on shore.
As the tube is completed, the rails will be laid within it for the trains of waa-o-ons

to be employed in bringing up segments of the rings as they may be required for

the construction of the tube, and for taking back the waste water from the hydraulic

presses, or any water from leakage during the construction.

The tube will be formed of rings of 10 feet in leng-th, each ring consisting of six

segments, all precisely alike, turned and faced at the flanges or joints, and fitted

together on shore pre-Nious to being taken into the bell, so that on their arrival the

segments may, with perfect certainty and precision, be attached to each other.

Every detail of construction has been designed, and so iar as we can see, no contin-

gency has been left unprovided for. The possibility of injury by anchors or wrecks,

or submarine currents has also been investigated. The tube" when laid will be
secure from aU dangers arising from such causes.

   The building of the tube will be commenced on dry land above the level of the
sea, and will be gradually submerged as the tube lengthens. The operations on
drj' land will be attended with more difficulty than those underwater; but all these

circumstances have been carefully considered and provided for. The rings forming
the tube will be made by special machinery, to be expressly constructed for facili-
tating the work and economising the cost. This machineiy is all desio-ned and
specified. The first half-mile will test the feasibility of construction ; for that will

have to be built both above and under water. "When once fairly under water the

progress should be rapid, and it is estimated that the whole uiidertakino- may be

easily completed in five years from the commencement.

   The precise line to be taken betwixt the English and French coasts can hardly
be determined without a more minute survey of the bottom of the Channel than at
present exists. It will probably be between a point in close proximity to Dover on

the English coast, and a point in close proximity to Cape Grisnez on the French

coast. From an examination of the Admiralty Charts, and of snch information as

at present exists, the sea-bed on this line appears to be the most uniform in level,
and, while free from hard rocks and broken ground, to consist of coarse sand, gra'\'el,

and cla}'. The average depth of water is about 110 feet, the maximum about
200 feet. On the line suggested the water increases in depth on both sides of the

Channel more rapidly than elsewhere, although in no instance will the gradient be
more than about 1 in lOO. The tube, when completed, will occupy about 16 feet

in depth above the present bottom of the sea. Up to the point on each shore at

which the depth of water above the top of the tube would reach, say 30 feet at
low water, an open pier, or other protection, would have to be constructed for the
purpose of pointing out its position, and of preventing vessels striking against the

tube. These piers may be rendered subservient to harbour improvements. The

tube at each end would gradually emerge from the water, and on arriving above
the level of the sea would be connected with the existing railway systems, so that

the same carriage may travel all the way from London to Paris, or, if Captain
Tyler's anticipations be realized, all the way from John O'Groat's to Bombay.

   The distance across the Channel on the line chosen is about twenty-two miles.
The tube as proposed is large enough for the passage of carriages of the present
ordinary construction, and to avoid the objections to the use of locomotives in a
tube of so great a length, and the nuisance which Avould bo thereby created, and
taking advantage of the perfect circular form which the mechanical operation of
turning, facing, &c., will insure, it is proposed to work the traffic by pneumatic
pressure. The air will be exhausted on one side of the train and forced in on the
other, and so the required difference of pressure will be given for carrying the train
through at any determined speed. Powerful steam-engines, with the necessary
apparatus for exhausting and forcing the air into the tube, will he erected on shore
at each end ; and supposing one tube only to exist, the traffic will be worked alter-

nately in each direction.
   This system of working the traffic will secure a constant sup])ly of the purest air,

which will accompany every train ; and sitting in a train on its passage through
the tube, will be as pleasant and agreeable, in respect of ventilation, as sitting in
the open air on the sea-side or in tlie best ventilated drawing-room.

   By this system of working and by adopting the best description of materials and

--rolling-stock, there would scarcely exist the chance of accident no collision could

take place. There would never be foul air within the tube to anno_y the passengers
or to hinder the traffic by the necessity of removing the tainted air before another
train could pass tlirough. The pneumatic system, thougli hitherto tried on a small
scale only, is undoubtedly one which, by the proper choice of means, can be cer-

tainly and easily, as well as cheaply worked, and in so long a tunnel, we believe it
to be in every way preferable to locomotive power, although that also could be

adopted.

   It has been found by calculations, that, for moving a large amount of tonnage
and a great number of passengers, the most economical arrangement will be to send
combined goods and passenger trains through the tube at twenty miles an hour,
with occasional express trains at thirty miles an hour. Thus, an ordinary or slow
train would occupy about sixty-six minutes in the transit, and a quick or express
train about forty-five minutes. In this way the tube, if fully worked, would
permit the passage of sixteen ordinary slow trains (eight each way), and six express

--trains (tliree each way), each conveying both goods and passengers about 10,000
--tons of goods per day, or upwards of 8,000,000 per ainium, and 5,000 passengers,

or nearly 2,000,000 per annum might be taken through, or a less amount of goods
and a larger number of passengers, or rice icrsiJj if circumstances rendered other

proportions necessary or desirable.

   The horse-power required for working the traffic with the above number of
ordinary and express trains, will be, on the average, 1750 indicated, or about
400 nominal horse-power at each end.

   The journey from London to Paris may be easily performed in eight hours, or

less, without any break or change of carriage, and the annoyance, delay, and inter-
ruption attending a sea-passage would be altogether avoided.

   The estimated cost of the whole undertaking, including the statioua and approaches

at eacli end, the engine power and machinery, the interest of outhiv during con-
struction and engineering superintendence, witli a large margin for contingencies,

 is £8,000,000.

    The tube is capable of conveying, on the pneumatic plan of working the trains,
with ease, 10,000 tons of goodsper day, and we may reasonably calculate that the
amoimt of traffic will be limited only by the power which may exist of passing it

through the tube.

   The annual working expenses will consist of maintenance, wliich will be light,
of the cost and wear and tear of the pumping-eugines, and of the ordinary expenses
of management, the whole of which would be most amply covered by £150,000.

   It would be easy to enlarge on the advantages to the whole world which such a
bond of imion would Ijring about, especially to the two great nations which would
be thereby most intimately connected ; but in a dry and scientific description of
the means by which this" important work of communication is proposed to be
accomplished, such language would be out of place. Let it be proved to be a
practicable undertaking, and the best or most promising which has been suggested,

and it may well claim the support and the material assistance of the Governments

of England and France, as well as of all the nations of Europe.

The effluent water could be made clear and innocuous, whilst the suspended or
solid matter could be sold to the farmer at a price which would pay the cost of fil-

On the Ilydranlic Buffer, and Expeiiments on the Flow of Liquids through

  small Orifices at High Velocities. By Colonel H. Clerk, li.A., F.E.S.

The hydraulic buffer was first applied for the purpose of checking the recoil of

guns in 1867. It consists of a wrouglit-iron cylinder closed at one end, the other
end fitted with a cap and stuffing-box, through which a piston-rod passes. The
piston fits well in the cylinder, and is perforated with four small holes. The dia-

meter of these holes, and the length of cylinder and piston-rod are determined by

the amount of recoil required, or the space in which the moving body has to be

brought to rest.

The cylinder is not filled entirely with water, enough air-space being left to al-

low of the displacement of the piston-rod, and to act as an air-bufi'er, to take off

the first violence of the blow. In actual practice, oil is used instead of water.

    Tn order to ascertain tlie action of this description of buffer -witli high velocities,

some experiments were made, and described iu tliis paper. They consisted in al-
lowing a truck loaded with various weights to run down an incline plane, so as to
attain a velocity from 10 feet to 44 feet per second, with which initial velocity the
piston was driven through the water. 13y means of a rotating-drum fixed above
the cj'liuder, and a pencil attached to the piston-rod, a curve was obtained from
which the velocity of the piston-rod during the whole of its motion can be deter-
mined, and a formula obtained for calculating the various dimensions of the buffer
required for any impinging weight, at any velocitj^

   The smoothness and ease with which a body mo'sang at a velocity of 44 feet per
second (or thirty miles an hour) was brought to rest renders it probable that this
description of buffer may be found useful for many purposes, especially as a sta-
tionary ))ufier on railway's.

        On the Hydraulic Internal Scrapinr/ of the Torquay Water-main.
                                     By R. E. Feotjde.

   Torquay is supplied with water from Dartmoor by a cast-iron main 13J miles iu
length, and having an aggregate fall of .370 feet between the inlet and the outlet
at the standard reservoir. The diameter for the first eight miles is 10 inches, for
the remainder 9 inches, an intermediate town drawing a regulated supply fit the
point of change. In 184.3, six years after the opening of the work, the delivery,
which appears from the first to have been defective, was found to be barely half
what the recognized formulas promised.

   The defect was attributed to internal oxidation ; but as this, though forming a
rough carbuncular surface, did not much exceed of an inch in average thick-

                                                                                                                                                                                                            i-

ness, the obstruction would have been insignificant according to the commonly re-
ceived view, that the water detained in the roughnesses would furnish a smooth
surface for the internal column to glide through ; and it followed that either the
received view needed some con-ection, or that local obstructions must ha's e been
established by accumulations of sediment or otherwise in the many deep depressions
of grouud-surfiice traversed by the main.

    Under the directions of Mr. "W. Froude a novel and effective test was debased and
employed for the determination of this question.

  A very delicate and accurate pressure-gauge was applied to the main, at short

and selected intervals throughout its length ; a method of drilling the necessary
holes and fitting the connecting taps, without emptying the main, having been con-
trived, which prevented any escape of water during the operation under the heaviest

pressures.

    Colmuns of water equivalent to the pressures thus tested were calculated : and
the heights of these being laid down on the section of the line of main, at the
positions of the several gauge-stations, or, in other words, being added to the datum-
 lieights of those stations, the resulting elevation of the column-summits were found
 to form, for the 10-inch and 9-inch pipes respectively, perfectly uniform gradients,
 showing that in each the consumption of pressure per mile was also uniform
throughoiit, and that there could be no local obstructions.

    The incrusted oxide thus appeared to be the only known cause of obstruction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

 and the late Mr. Appold, with characteristic acuteuess and boldness, suggested
 that it would be possible to force a suitably constructed scraping implement, along
 the main internally, by the existing hydraulic pressm-e, so as to remove the incrus-

 tation.

   In accordance with his directions, a stont bar about 5 feet long was armed at the

tail-end with two expansive cup-shaped and cup-leathered pistons, placed with such
an interval between them, as to ensure the mamtcnance of pressure while passing-
stop-valves and branches. Its front end was armed with four pairs of scrapers,

Ueach formed of Hat iron bar, bent tlatways like the letter reversed, the cross

sti-okes forming cutting edges which the spring of the metal pressed against the

sides of the pipe, the whole circumference of which they together embraced, and
intended to act not imlike the patent road-scraper. The cutting edges were
" skewed" so as to prevent their dropping into, and laying hold of any pipe-joints

more than usually open; a regulated flow of water was permitted to pass the

piston, so as to drive the scrapings forward.

  The Torquay Local Board, on whom the responsibility rested, were induced, on

]\Ir. Fronde's strong recommendation, to allow the implement to be tried on a mile
of main ; not without hesitation, for the shortness of the existing water-supply en-
hanced the anxiety attending so novel and bold an experiment, which, should the

scraper stick fast, might involve serious delay in the reinstatement of the delivery
the main had to be cut and closed again in two places, at all events. The

scraper, happilj', travelled the mile without difficulty ; and the pressure-gauge test,

tried before the operation, and again after the flow had been reinstated, showed,
by the consequent reduction of pressm'e at the upper end of the distance, and its
increase at the lower end, that the scraped pipe drew away the water from above,
and delivered it belowVith greatlj' increased freedom : 21 feet of "head " had pre-
viously been consumed on the distance, 7 feet only were consumed on it subse-

--quently, a dirterence promising an improvement of 75 per cent, in the delivery,

when the pipe shoidd be scraped throughout*.
   One material cause of anxiety was removed, by finding that the grating noise

made by the scraper in transitu indicated its exact pof<ition to all observers who

accompanied it. Thus encouraged, the Local Board entrusted to Mr. Froude the
completion of the work throughout ; but the experience gained in the trial showed
that an amended scraper and complete appliances would be required for it.

   Lengths of pipe, fitted with moveable covers to admit of the insertion of the

scraper, were interpolated at suitable positions ; and a new scraper was made fitted

--with hard steel cutters, pressed against the pipe by independent steel springs, im-

provements which the preliminary trial had shown to be essential to a persistent

and vigorous scraping action. In the extended operation, serious difficulties which

fortunately had not appeared in the preliminary trial, were encountered in the

large number of stones (some several inches in diameter) which had been carelessly

enclosed in the pipe when laid                                                                                                                                           and  it  became  necessary to  clear  the way for the

scraper by passing first a strong cast-u-on cup, which commmuted the smaller

stones and picked up the large ones, and eventually the whole work was completed.

For reasons too long to state here, the impi-ovemeut first attained was only 40,

not 70 per cent., as had been hoped ; but subsequent repeated scrapings with a very

improved pattern of scraper, wliich does not, however, admit of brief description,

have increased the delivery by considerably over 100 per cent.; it was only .317

gallons per minute bef(n'e opei-ations were commenced, it was G55 after the most

recent scraping; and the operation is now so simplified and well understood, that

but for the change of diameter, which involves a change of scraper, the whole

length of main could be traversed witliout any pause.

   It is found that very soon after the scraping a perceptible decline of delivery
takes place, proljably owing to a gradual erosion of the smeared smoothness, which
is likelv to be an immediate result of the operation ; and besides, minute pustules
of oxide begin at once to form, and it is evident that mere infinitesimal roughness

sensibly obstructs the flow, but in its practical aspect the operation is perfectly

successful.

212 REPORT--1869.

througli the Torquay -water-main, under small variations in smoothness of internal
surface, suggest the necessity of a revision of the theory of " Huid friction," which
in its commonly accepted form, ignores the etl'oct of " quality of surface " entirely,
and in which, even as amended by later able writers, less importance is attached
to it than the variations referred to prove it to possess.

   The theory appears defective in two other important respects.
    (1) In assigning to pipes of different diameters, imder the same hydraulic gra-
dient, a How proportioned to the power (|) of the diameter, it proceeds on the
assumption that the ratio of the mean velocity to the maximum velocitj' is the same

in pipes of all diameters. This is equi-valent to assuming, either that the velocity
of the central particles of a flowing column does not exceed that of the circumfer-
ential particles more in a 12-inch than in a G-inch pipe ; or that particles of water
can glide more freely past the semi-rough surface of the pipe, than they can glide

past each other ; whereas, since the latter alternative seems absurd, we ought to

expect that within the 12-inch pipe, the particles occupying the central inches
must possess, in addition to the velocity of those immediately surrounding them,

the whole mean velocity which they would have possessed if flowing indepen-
dently in a 6-inch pipe ; an expectation irreconcileable with the law that the deli-
very with a given hydraulic gradient is as the power (-|) of the diameter.

    (2) The commonly received theory assigns to every square foot of an extended
plane, drawn edgeways tlirough undisturbed fluid, one and the same intensity of
I'rictional resistance ; and this is expressed in terms of the velocity of the surface,
 calculated with reference to the undisturbed part of the fluid, and is supposed to

 create an equal resistance per square foot throughout the plane ; whereas it is cer-
tain that the anterior portions of the surface, in rubbing against the particles which
it passes, and experiencing resistance from them, 7iuist impress on them equivalent

force in the direction of its motion, and must impart to them some velocity in that
direction. Thus, though it may be in some sense asserted that the anterior portions

 of the plane rub against the contiguous particles with the entire velocity of the plane,

 since these particles are undisturbed, this cannot be truly asserted of the posterior

 portions of the plane, since the particles against wliich these rub have already re-
 ceived a velocity conformable to that of the phtue ; and a " state of motion" will be
 thus produced in the contiguous particles involving a widening body of fluid, and

with increasing velocity imparted to it, as we recede foot by foot sternward along

 the plane ; forming, in fact, a '' cui-rent," created and left behind, by the transit of the

 plane, such that if we could integrate the volume of current created in each unit of
 time, and the exact velocity possessed by each of its particles, the aggregate mo-
 mentum must be precisely tliat which is due to the frictional resistance of the en-

 tire plane acting during that unit of time. Obviously the stemward portions of the
 plane moving forward in such a favouring current, must experience a less intense
 frictional resistance than the anterior portions.

   A consideration of these objections to the received theory, the latter especially,

 suggests the question, how the velocity of the surface relatively to the fluid is

 properly to be estimated, as relevant to, or as governing the intensity of frictional

 resistance. And in attempting to arrive at this, it is plainly necessary to take ac-

 count of the manner in which, and the distance to which, the velocity which the
 rubbing surface imparts to the particles, spreads into the fluid.

    With a view to this, the following propositions seem relevant and admissible.

   A( 1) surface free from such roughnesses and prominences as to produce eddies,

 if of such quality that the fluid thorouglily zeds it, will experience the same resis-
 tance in moving past the particles which resist it, as if it had itself consisted of

 particles of the fluid.

    (2) No particles of the contiguous fluid can be strictly regarded as sliding past

 the surface, or, vice versa, in the sense in which a solid slides past a solid ; but be-
 tween the complete motion of the surface, and the complete quiescence of the fluid
 where it is yet undisturbed, a graduated state of motion must exist, the mamier
 of the graduation govei-ning the intensity of the force transmitted from particle to

  particle.

    (3) When a plane slides edgeways through tmdisturbed fluid, part of the force

 which it transmits into the fluid around it is employed in giving motion to the par-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  213

tides wliicli it .affects, and as these in turn, when put in motion, affect other parti-

cles outside tliem, the remainder of the force is transmitted to those particles.
Hence it becomes desirable to conceive an arrangement under which the force

would be transmitted entire, instead of being partly absorbed in momentum, and
to trace the law of transmitted motion which would correspond with this.

   (4) Such a state must be conceived to exist if we imagine two parallel planes, of

infinite extension each way, having the intervening space filled with Huid, and
having possessed for an infinite period equal edgeways velocities (say v) in oppo-
site directions. The trnnsmission of motion and of force in the intervening fiuid
must have become established and permaneiit, and the following propositions woidd
seem true respecting it.

   (a) Each plane must be experiencing throughout its surface a definite frictional
force per square foot, acting in the direction of the plane, equal and opposite in the
two planes, and the force must be transmitted statically from plane to plane by the
state of motion in the intervening fiuid.

   (b) Along the imaginaiy plane which bisects the intervening space, the particles
of fluid must be stationary, since they are similarly situated with respect to the two
equal opposite forces and motions.

   (c) Between the imaginary central plane, and each of the two moving planes,
the particles must possess a graduated motion corresponding with that of the

nearer plane.

   If we further imagine the whole intervening space to be subdivided into laminfe

or layers of equal infinitesimal thickness, say 1, 2, 3, . . . n, it would seem that, to
transmit the definite force vmchanged from layer to layer. No. 1 must be gliding
past Xo. 2 exactly as fast as No. 2 past No. -3, and so on throughout, from one
outer plane to the other, for these are to be judged as adherent to the fluid, as the
fluid to itself (see prop. 1) ; .since that supposition, exclusively, secures throughout

an identity in the relative motions of similarly placed contiguous particles : if we

were to suppose different gradations of velocity in relation to lateral space, or
thickness of layer, in different parts of the series of layers, it would follow that dif-
ferent relative motions of similarh' placed contiguous particles would develope the
same amount of force.

   The character of this graduated transition of velocity may be best explained by
observing that if at any moment a straight filament were laid at right angles

across the interval between the planes, and were to accept the motion of the
particles which it traversed, it would remain straight, while it continued to
describe a growing rectilinear angle, the angle being as the time, and the centre of
motion being the centre of the space between the planes where the particles are

.stationary.

   The conception of this angle will be relied on as important in the course of the
investigation, and it will, for convenience, be termed the " filamental" angle (cf)),
and will be taken account of as described in some definite infinitesimal interval

of time, At.

   Bearing in mind the graduated transition of velocity, it follows that if we were

to substitute for any one of the interior layers a plane similar to the original planes,

assigning to it the velocity of the layer for which it is substituted, we might re-
move the fiuid external to it on one side without in any degree altering the state

of relative motion (as expressed by the filamental angle) and of force, in the
layers of fiuid which remained.

   The absolute velocity of this plane might be less in any assignable ratio than that
of the original planes, j'et it would expeiience the same resistance per square foot
as they ; and it follows that the frictional force experienced by a surface moving

past the particles of a fiuid, is independent of the absolute velocity of the plane, so
long as the filamental angle is imchanged. If, retaining the original planes and

the space between them unaltered, we assign to them an established velocity, say

m7)1 times as great as before, the filamental angle will also have become times

as great, expressing the circumstance that the relative motion of similarly placed
contiguous particles is increased in that ratio, and that a condition appropriate to
a difference of frictional force has been established. The force of fluid friction
must be regarded as governed, not by the absolute velocity of the moving surface,
but by its velocity as related to that of contiguous particles, expressed in terms

   The best experiments seem to show generally that the force of fluid friction is

as the square of the velocity ; and as it is probable that for any given plane moved

with various velocities the integral value of ^p throughout the area will in each

case be as the velocity, it woidd seem that we may substitute for the ordinary ex-
pression F=kv'^a (in which F is the force per square foot at every point in the area,

V the absolute velocity of the plane in relation to the wholly undisturbed fluid,

and a the area) F--Jkcj)'^ da, where ^ is the value of filamental angle which the

If to an infinitely extended plane, immersed in an infinitely extended fluid, we

suddenly assign a definite velocity and maintain it, motion will gradually spread

itself into the fluid from the plane, the layers nearest the plane having always the

greater A'elocity, and each experiencing an acceleration depending on the differ-

ence of frictional force measured at its two faces. If the thickness of any layer

   On this basis a differential equation might be constructed .sho^^'ing the rate at
which the velocity would penetrate the fluid in the case supposed, and this might

be extended to the case of a finite plane penetrating an undisturbed mass of fluid

with a definite velocity.

            By TnoMAs Login, C.E., F.E.S.E.', and Memh. C.E. Inst.

             [A communication ordered to be printed in c.rtcnso in the Proceedings.]

   At the last Meeting of this Association the author drew attention to the
" Abrading and Transporting Power of Water," when he ventured to bring fonvard

his views regarding this important subject. Since that time he has studied the
subject still more, ami in the theory then brought forward he has been more and
more coniirmed.

   As many of those present may not have seen or heard what these Aiews are,

he briefly recapitulated the most prominent points before entering on the question
of their practical application to engineering works.

   1. All silt-bearing streams when in train only transport a given proportion of

earthy matter,

   2. That the proportion depends on the velocity, and the nature of the materials

transported.

  3. Any increase of the velocity must cause a tendency to cutting, and any decrease

to deposit.

   4. That a silt-bearing stream is retarded by having to exert a force sufficient to

transport certain proportions of certain descriptions of earthy matter, consequently

the slope required for a given velocity under such circumstances must be gi-eater
somewhat than if the water was pm-e.

   From those conclusions he amved at certain deductions regarding the flow of
water down irrigation canals, which at present it is not necessary to dwell on, and

he went on to state that, so far as his personal observations extended, they went
to show that, though the transporting power of water increased with the velocity,
yet it diminished as the depth increased, and suggested that this was possibly owing
to the rotatory motion of liiiids, wliich are supposed to follow some figure more of

the nature of the involutes of circles rather than straight lines.

   Having got so far, he stated his belief that it signified little what may be the

cross section or velocity of a stream while passing over or through a work,
·so long as it could again resume its natural section and velocity immediately on
leaving it.

   The main object of his former paper was to show how the above-mentioned

conclusions affected the question as to the ]n'oper velocity to give to artificial

rivers, that is, irrigation canals in India and elsewhere, and on the present occasion he

proposed confiuinghis attention to the rivers of Northern India, with suggestions

as to how thev should be bridged.

To do so, however, probably it wiU be best to give a general desciiption of the

plains of Northern India without attempting to infringe on the work of the geolo-

gist, but simply to state what is now to be fomid, and what changes in nature have

lately taken place and are at present being worked out.

   The plains of Northern India may be considered imder two great divisions,
namely, the Gangetic "\'alley and the'Valley of the Indus. Approximately it may

be said that from the head of the Bay of Bengal to where the Ganges escapes

from the hills is a little short of 1200 mUes. The general shape of the surface of

the country would in section be the quadrant of a very flat ellipse, with a small

portion of botli ends cut off* ; the total fall, rather less than lOUO feet, commen-

cing with rapid slopes near the hills, and ending with a fall of only one or two
inches in the mile at the sea. These plains consist of alluvial deposits to unknown

depths in alternate strata of clay and sand ; but in addition to this are to be found

extensive beds of limestone, known in India by the name of " kunkur."

As a general rule, the uppermost stratum is a rich light clay from 5 to 10 feet

in depth, with sand below it, and it is chiefly owing to this that Upper Lidia is .so

very productive. Strata of clay, sand, and " kunkur " are met with at various

depths, and of various thicknesses, and all have a general parallelism to the sur-

face, but how or when deposited the author Avill not attempt to discuss.

These plains are cut up by deep troughs or valleys, usually from 5 to 10 miles
Abroad, of various depths, from that of 10 to even 100 feet.

them was before the Section ; it is through these vallej'S that the large rivers

wLieh are fed by the melting of the snow now meander.

These valleys are known in India by the name of " Khadirs," aud_ as there is

nothing similar to them that the author is aware of in England, it will be best to

adhere to this local name in contradistinction to what is called Bhaugir, or the
high-level plain already referred to. The formation of these " Khadirs" i.a, how-

ever, a matter of interest to the engineer, so the author will state his views as to

how they were scooped out and are now being filled up.

In the' great valley of the Dehra Doon, lying between the Ganges and the Jumna,

and beyond the Scwalic range, where the ground chiefly consists of boulders and

sand, -\\'ith a co^·ering of A-egetable soil, there are evident marks to show that these

two rivers stood at much higher levels than at the present day. It is also -(-ery

evident that the sea extended several hundred miles further inland than the present

head of the Bay of Bengal, so that at no veiy distant period, speaking of time in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               _

a geological sense, the chief rivers of N orthern India must have had, when escaping

from the hills, their beds higher than at present, and their channels shorter; so, with

slopes more rapid, the transporting power of these rivers must have been much

greater than now, and a violent cutting back on the bed has taken place from

the sea, scooping out these deep troughs to excessive depths through the alluvial

plains.

   This also would further add to the declivity of the beds of these rivers near the
foot of the hills, and thus boulders could be transported for many miles further

into the plains than they are at present.
   It is thus the author would account for sand only being foimd to great depths in

the valleys of the large rivers some distance down their coiu'se, as, for example, on

the Beas", where the Uelhi Railway crosses it ; also near the foot of the hiUs, shingle
and boulders some twenty miles down the course of these rivers are to be found a
few feet below the sand, as in the case of the Dadoopoor dam at the head of the

Jumna Canal, where the foundations rest on shingle at a depth of about 10 feet

below the bed.

   With sand overhdng boulders and shingle it can only be supposed that the beds

of the rivers are here being raised, and as the Delta is extending year by year out
into the Bay of Bengal, the river here also is becoming higher, so it is natural to
suppose that all along the course of the river between these points a similar process

is o-oing on. This is a very important point to know ; for though this silting up may

                                 * Possibly this curve may be parabolic.
216 REPORT~1869.

be imperceptible, yet it clearly sliows that there is no danf^er to any permanent
work by a general depression of the beds of these rivers going on, as some
suppose, because an}^ scooping out of the bed is only local, and can be met by local
remedies.

   Borings in the beds of torrents which drain the southern slopes of the hills, and
not the interior, and which meander over the plains rather than intersect them,
give very different residts to what are found in the ^"alleys of the large rivers, as
alternate strata of clay, sand, and kunkur are found.

   It is necessary to know the rainfall at various points to xmderstand certain
natural features, and the changes now going on. In the Gangetic valley the rain-

fall is considerable, being, on an average, nearly

               20 inches a year at Delhi,

               30 ,, ,, 3Ieerut,
               40 ,, ,, Eoorkie.

   The level of the Bhangir here being so very much above that of the Khadir, a
gradual wearing down of the Bhangir is going on ; thus the high level plains between
the Ganges and the Jumna, commonly called " the Doab,"' is cut up by several large

streams. "With such a rainfall a,s there is all over tlie Doab, it is natural to suppose
that there must be some line marking out the catchment basins of each stream, and
that this line, by its being least exposed to the action of running water, remains the
highest, and is neither more nor less than the " backbone of the country," not

caused by any upheaval, but simply that it is worn down less than any other por-

tion of the plains. It is along this ridge or ridges that irrigation canals should be
led ; but as the plains are so level, the general direction of these ridges is difficult

to determine. This at once explains why so many cross sections of the countiT

have to be taken to discover the best line for an irrigation canal and its liranches,
which are iiOt necessary with a road or a railway where dislance becomes so im-
portant an element.

   The author would now make a few remarlis on the valley of the Indus, that is,

the plains which form the " Doabs "' of the Punjab, which are similar, geologically,
to those of the Gangetic valley, the only difference being that they have not any
deep rivers intersecting the plains, nor ridges similar to what ai-e found in the North-
western Provinces.

   Take, for example, the Richna Doab, the high level plains between the Ravee
and the Chanab I'ivers, which is 50 miles broad near Lahore, where the Bhangir is
only about 10 feet above the Khadir of the Ravee ; and on the Chanab side at
Wuzeerabad the difference of level is only 17 feet, so that iu a lateral direction

there can be very little fall.

   Again, the rainfall is very little compared with what there is in the valley of
the Ganges, as approximately it is at Jhuug 4 inches yearly, or i of the fall at

Delhi.

and these points are respectively about equidistant from the hills. The fact is that

the land nhsorbs all the rain which falls, so that at fifty miles below the hills every

A-estige of drainage-lines disappears. Not that no drainage passes over this line,

for it is on tliis parallel that the Lahore and Peshawur road runs ; and 13,470

running feet of gaps, in addition to 37 bridges and cuh-erts of various sizes, are left

iu this embankment to pass off the cross drainage which comes down from the

It appears to the author that in such a case it would perhaps have been better

cither to divert the drainage higher up, or to have had no road whatever raised, hut

to have allmved the food to pass ijiiieflj/ (ff over the road. The effect in this case, by

increasing the velocity at certain points, has been, for the comparatively y;«;-e water

which had harmlessly flowed through fields of cultivation, to sweep away scleral

miles more of the embankment, thus showing " that with increased velocity there
must be abrasion." "Where floods even at higher velocities are not obstructed, no
such action takes place. The author in October ISG-j laid down a causeway of
" kunkur " metal across the Khadir of the Sutledge at Loodvanah level with the
surface of the country, and up to 1867 it was standing, and for anything he knows

to the contrary, it may be there still. Thus a number of floods huxc passed over
it at great velocities, yet as the water had its^j?'op«' had of silt there has been no

cutting.

   But to continue, the Eichna Doab being so little raised above the Khadirs, there
could be no great fall east or west ; consec^uently, with a plain fifty miles broad with
a considerable fiill towards the sea, the tendency would be for the floods to spread

themselves over it, and as the rainfall is so little, this drainage is ultimately ab-
sorbed. There is therefore no weari/if/ down of this plain by the action of water

so instead of there being any natural ridges, the surface of the country is so uniform

that the author found by one of his trial cross-sections, with points taken at every
400 feet, in a distance of six miles in a straight line, that the highest point did not
exceed in height the most depressed more than .3 feet, though the fall of the
country at right angles to this line was some 2 feet in the mile. It is this imi-
formity of the plain and the richness of the soil that make the Eichua Doab so pecu-

liarly well adapted for irrigation, and in this opinion the author is supported by the
late chief engineer of the Punjab, Lord Napier of Magdala.

   The courses of rivers in India are very changeable, so much so that Government

have to collect the land-rents in the neighbourhood of these rivers on a difl'ereut
system to other parts, so as to admit of change of proprietorship as the course of the
river shifts. These deep troughs or valleys, called '* khadirs," are the limits through
which the rivers change their com'ses from time to lime ; and though the course

may be said to he always serjjentine, the changes are not exactly so, but follow that
of the valley; thtis there is a gradual movement of all the bends downwards, so
that after a given luimber of years, say half a century, the river may be exactly as

it was fifty years before, but at the end of tweuty-flve years every bend would be
found at the opposite side of the valley.

   Sometimes the changes are more or less sudden, when instead of the channel
moving gradually down, these bends are diverted, and the two ends get silted up

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

thus these diverted channels often become a marsh, and are known by difierent
names in different countries, such as " broads " in Norfolk, " lagoons " in America,
"jheels" in Upper India, " dhars " in Bengal, and "choungs" in Burmah. One
remarkable feature of them is that they are on a lower level generally than the
main river, proving that the rivers are raising their beds ; but it is this peculiarity
that makes it all the more necessary to guard against the tendency of the main
stream returning to its deserted channels, and it is to this the author would more
f)articularly call attention, for he believes that hereafter it may be a work of no
 ittle dilHculty to prevent this where the large rivers are crossed by railways.

   During high floods a large body of inundation water passes down the vallev,
which is alt more or less under water, but its flow is retarded for various

reasons, chiefly owing to vegetation ; consequently, comparatively speaking, the
water is pure, and does not hold in suspension anything like the same proportion
of earthy matter that the main stream does.

   To give sufficient waterway by flood-openings to pass off all the inundation at
its natural velocity would require exceeding!}- large bridges. To increase the

velocity through the bridges implies a heading-up of the water with a still greater
reduction in the velocity on the up-stream side of the embankment, which neces-
sitates a still further reduction of the silt held in suspension.

   The water thus lightened of its load, rushes through the flood-openings and
reaches the down-stream side at an increased velocity, in nearly a pure state ; and
as it must take up a proportion of earthy matter due to this velocity, a violent
action takes place below the bridge. Nay, sometimes owing to this increased
velocity on the up-stream side, a scooping out takes place above the bridge; and if
the bridge happens to have a raised flooring, it simply becomes a submerged weir,
doing harm instead of good by deranging the flow. If floorings are to be used,
they should be as inverts to rest the bridge on, and not raised to a higher level
 218 REPORT--1869.

  thau the foundations. In nine cases out of ten it would be better to brealc up all
  raised floorings, and throw tlie material round the pier foundations, rather than
  give a plunging direction to the water down-stream.

     If this view be correct, it at once proves that with loose sand to unknown depths,
 the only safe mode for bridging the large rivers is to have deep foundations, which
 necessitate great spans, and iron girder jjridges, and as the sand pump makes the
 sinking such a simple matter now, the difference of 10 feet more or less of depth
 in cost is insiguihcant. (In Madras, where there is an imlimitod supply of heavy
 material, the ease may be different, and there shallow foundations may be more

 economical.) An extra depth of 10 feet or so, however, is nearly tantamount to

 doubling the sectional area of the watei-way, and as water does not move in straight
 lines, it matters little what the shape of tlie section may be when passing through
 a bridge ; thus the waterway may be doubled without adding to the breadth, but
 by deepening the bed. By this means, without adding much to the cost of a bridge,
 not only the main stream, but also the inundation water could all be passed through
 the one bridge, and thus a great saving effected b}' having no flood-openings, and
 consequently no danger of the main river taking to these side openings, while the
 only inconvenience would be to cause tbe flood to last a few hours longer than it

 otherwise would.

    But, however, where the embankment crossing a valley is of a great length, all
 the water could not drain back to the main stream, after the flood had passed ofl', par-
 ticularly when, as has been already shown, the gTOund is much lower away back from
 the river than at its banks. To get rid of this Avater, siphons with spoon-mouthed
 openings at both ends should be jirovided, so that though the water could rush
 through the greater length of the siphon at a velocity of even 10 feet a second, yet
 it would approach and leave the siphon at the natural velocity of perhaps not more
 than 2 feet a second. Thus no violent action could take place either above or
 below, and at the points of admission and egress, the water would have the proper
 load of silt due to its velocity.

    From all the author has read, seen, and heard, he cannot help thinking that a

 large proportion of the late accidents on works in India is to be attributed to the
 causes assigned in this paper, namely, an excessi\'e velocity given to a stream that
 has already been partialh- depri\ed of its natural load of earthy matter, thereby
 causing a violent action below, and sometimes even above bridge.

    The importance of the questions now raised as to bridging rivers in India is
 daily becoming greater ; for, while this paper was being prepared, the Government
 of India has determined to construct the Lahore and Peshawur IJailway, which
 line must cross, not onlj^ the Ravee, the Chanab, and the .Ihiluni, but "also the
 Indus passing over the IMchna Doab, which has been described above. Should,
 therefore, the suggestions now made be con-ect, it is evident that hundreds of
 thousands of poimds may be saved by adopting them, and thus, a proper knowledge
 of these laws arri^x'd at, may enable the engineer to make this line of railway,
 which is supposed to be one of the most difficult lines to construct in India, with
 perfect confidence of success, and at possibl}' less cost than many of those now

 constructed.

    The author would only now add, that the knowledge of the abrading and tran-

 sporting power of water is not only desirable in designing roads, railway's, or canals,
 but affects every question connected -wiih hydraulic works in all countries. It
 would occupy too much time to allude to them further; but he may, ho-\\-ever, venture

 to ask what would be the fluancial state of Southern India (which now does not

 pay) if harbours were constructed on sound principles, so as not to be silted up ?
    Time -will not admit of the author's describing a modilication of the siphons,

 which he thinks, in some instances, may be introduced with ecimomy for crossing
 minor streams, instead of bridging them in the usual manner ; but ho believes not

 only can this be done with advantage, biit also, with spoon-mouthed siphons,

in Bengal inundatioij. water may be carried through embankments in regulated

 volumes, so as to be aya^hible for irrigation, thus adding both to the fertility of
 the soil and the salubrity ^i! the climate, while the embankments would protect
the country from those devastating floods which so often destroy both life and

^property.

   Description of a New System of House Ventilation. By J. D. Moekison.

   The maiu features of this novel system of warming- and ventilating, consist in
so circulating pure fi-esh air (tlirough a warming chamber) into the room, and of foul

ail" (through the tire) into tire chimney, that all local currents are resolved into one,
which, describing an unbroken circuit, forms an upper warmer current from the
fire to the opposite wall, and an under colder current from the wall back again to
the lire, when, after supporting combustion, the products escape up the chimney.

The vacuum thus produced by the warmer current through the chinniey creates
the now colder current from the atmosphere, which, passing tlirough the heating-
chamber, supports the respiration of any number of men.

On an Imjjroved Vertical Annular Hi<jh-pressure Steam-boiler.

Nowwith an extreme simplicity of construction.      the boiler stands by itself in this

latter respect. The body of the boiler and the fire-box are constructed separately

as distinct parts, the water and flue-spaces being disposed annularly. The outer

part consists of the external skin or shell of the boiler, and a concentric inner

cylinder is rivetted thereto near the bottom, a wrought-iron ring being interposed

to keep the proper distance apart. This inner cylinder is also firmly stayed to the

shell by screwed stays placed at suitable distances apart.

To the top of this inner cylinder a tube-plate is rivetted, which is also connected

to a central pendant annular water-space, descending to within a short distance of

the furnace-bars.

Thus the fire-box proper consists of two rings forming an aimular water-space

round the furnace, the inner ring being made slightly conical to give a better heat-

ing-surface, and at the same time permit the steam to get away freely. The top of

this fire-box is connected to the tuoe-plate by a series of short lap-welded tapered

tubes, screwed at both ends.

   In the boilers first constructed on the ^Vllibon and Manbre system, the central

pendant portion was merely a receiver, pocket, or " pot," but in the boilers now

constructed by them an important modification has been introduced to this portion

of the boiler. The central portion forms part of the fire-box, to which it is con-

nected by the short horizontal tubes or Hue-passages shown at the top of the cen-

tral pendant portion. The products of combustion, on reaching the top of the fire-

box, are deflected by the upper tube-plate, and descend between the outer ring of

the fire-box and the inner cylinder or body of the boiler, until they arrive at the

bottom, where they pass into an annular flue surrounding the base of the boiler,

and from thence by an oblong flue or uptake to the chimney.

The flue-passages are made sufficiently large to allow of their being cleaned easily,

and any repairs ett'ected.

   The annular flue sm'rounding the base of the boiler may also be converted into

a feed water-heater by jacketting or surrounding it with a water-space.

   The feed is pumped in by a circulating pump ; a check-valve and a reUef-valve

being pro^vided to prevent any excess of pressure.

This system possesses all the well-known advantages of vertical independent

boilers, rendering unnecessary the hea^-y item of expenditure for the setting of

Cornish and other enclosed boilers, whilst it allows of free inspection, and the con-

sequent ready detection of leakage or other defects, and thus tends materially to

diminish the risk of explosion.

Amongst some of the leading features of this boiler may be included the thorough

circulation of water which is insured, the large extent of effective heating-surface,

the rapid boiling oft" of large vohmies of steam, the thorough utilization of the pro-

ducts of combustion, simplicity in construction of the several parts, and great
strength of the whole as a steam-generator.

Railway Passengers^ and Guards^ Communication.

      By S. Alfred Vaeley, Assoc. Inst. C.E.

   The author remarked that the subject had occupied considerable attention, that
he had been engaged upon it during the last four years, and he thought there would
be some points of interest in a description of a system of communication which was
applied in 18(36, and is at the present time in use on the Eoyal train in which Iler
Majesty travels to and from the A'orth ; tiie s}-stem referred to had also been applied
to an ordinary train, and daily used for more than eighteen months.

   The author stated there was a belief on the part of some (but by no means all of
the railway authorities) that, owing to the subtle nature of electricity, it was not

suitable for the purpose of train intercommunication ; but he thought this belief

arose chiefly from a want of acquaintance with the progress made by those who

have made the practical application of electricity their special study, and he believed

the time would come wlien electricity would be imiversally acknowledged to be

the best medium for signalling upon the rolling-stock of this country.

The author remarked the application of electricity to signalling in trains, con-

sidered in the abstract  as an electrical problem, was a sim)ile  one                 the mechanical
                                                                                   ;

difficulties in its application, however, had been somewhat complex, and the solution

of these difficulties had depended chiefly upon the mechanical construction of the

various parts.

   The conditions laid down by the railway authorities as necessary, were that the

system should be simple and not liable to derangement, that passengers should be
able easily to signal in an emergency, and that the apparatus should be detective

to prevent the repudiation of a signal when once given ; besides this it was suggested,

for the sake of economy, that the apparatus should be portable, so that it could bo

moved from one train to another if required.
   Numerous electrical systems had been proposed, but only three had been practically

applied.

   The first on the list was Mr. Preece's, in use on the Lundon and South- Western
Railway ; the second was Jlr. C. Y. Walker's, in use on the South-Eastcrn Railway

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the third the joint invention of JNIr. JNIartin and Mr. S. A. Varley, and in use upon
the London and North-Western Railway.

   The three systems referred to differed from one another in the mechanical con-
struction of the couplings, the alarums, the galvanic batteries, and the carriage

signalling apparatus ; he did not, however, propose to discuss their respective merits,
butwould couttne himself to adeseription of the system with which he was associated.

  An insulated wire was run underneath the carriages, the coupling bars and iron-

work of the carriages were connected electrically together, and the circuit was com-
pleted, when the apparatus was in use, through the insulated wire, the apparatus,

the ironwork, and tlie railway metals.

   Two insulated wires, the one connected to the ironwork, the other to the insulated

wire running under the vehicles, were led up into the compartments of each carriage,
and bringing these into contact with one another closed the circuit through the
galvanic batteries and the alarums in the vans, and on the engine.

   The connexions between vehicle and vehicle composing the train were effected
by means of two coupling-ropes containing flexible conductors ; this enabled the
can-iages to be joined together at either end, and gave a double connexion between

*ach vehicle.

   The coupling-ropes were made by wrapping a wire spirally round a hempen core
                        TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                     221

seven of these were then laid longitudinally and bound togetlier by a serving of
hemp protected by an insulating compound ; each rope therefore contained seven
separate conductors ; and in practice the ropes were found to be very durable ; for
as the conducting- wires touched one another throughout, should one or all of them
be broken, continuity would be still maintained by the ends of some of the wires
touching, and unless the rope was actually severed the electrical continuity was

still complete.

   Malleable cast-iron eyes were attached to the ends of the coupling-ropes where
the connexions were made, and these were grasped by strong iron hooks actuated

by powerful springs placed in cast-iron boxes attached to the carriages.

 " The eyes of the couplings were coated with copper at the points of contact, and
pressed against a plate of brass attached to the hooks, by this means very perfect

contact was secured.

The  apparatus  in  the  vans  consisted  of  a  battery  and  an  electrical  alarum                                     these
                                                                                                                       ;

were placed in boxes ; and the connexions were made by simply hanging them on

brass studs.

The vans were supplied also with ringing keys, to enable the guards to signal

to one another.

   The apparatus on the engine was a portable alarum, and the power to work it

was obtained from the galvanic battery in the leading van.
   The carriage-apparatus consisted of a lever handle in a metal box, which when

pulled closed the circuit and became locked ; all the alarums were set ringing, and

continued to ring until the apparatus had been reset by a special key.
   Tlie cost of maintenance w.is almost nominal, and no electrical knowledge was

required in its management, all the operations of testing being mechanical ; the
connexions also being double, any faulty coupling was readily detected, and the

system rendered most reliable, as the apparatus woidd work even in the unlikely

event of a faulty coupling in every carriage.

   To meet the wishes of the Board of Trade, some of the railway companies had

electrical systems applied to ordinary passenger-trains, and the system referred to

by the author was titted up on an express train running 250 miles daily between
London and Wolverhampton. This train was started from all the stations at which

it stopped by means of the apparatus, and its working reported by the guards, and
in tliis way it was tested twenty-two times daily.

   Many thousands of signals have been sent and recorded, the apparatus having

been at work on the train more than eighteen months, and its performance, as

shown by the guards' reports, has been marked by the most unvarying regularity.

The distinguishing features claimed for this system are :
I. The construction of the flexible conductors renders it almost impossible for

the electrical continuity to fail.

   II. V'ery perfect contact is obtained by the construction of the hook-and-eye

--coupling, the surfaces of contact being made of brass and copper metals not

liable to oxidation ; the act of coupling cleans the contact surfaces, and the hook-
nnd-eye couplings are firmly grasped by powerful springs.

III. The couplings release themselves without damage, if the carnages be

forcibly separated, and the breaking away of a train can be indicated.

r\^. The connexions being double between each vehicle, the efficiency of the

system is not impaired even in the unlikely event of there being se^-eral faulty

connexions in a train.

V. The apparatus and connexions can be tested at any time, and any defect

localized without special electrical knowledge.

YI. The connexions in the vans and on the engine being made by hanging up

the apparatus, and the batteries aud alarums being portable, they can be readily

shifted from one train to another, or replaced, if necessary.

VII. Greater striking-power is obtained in the construction of the alarums than

in the usual construction of continuous ringing bells ; and all the parts being
mounted upon one piece of cast iron, they are very durable, and not liable to

derangement.

   Vni. The carriage apparatus and all parts of the system are constructed to stand
very rough treatment without damage.
223 KEPORT--1869.

   IX. The apparatus is not expensive in its first cost, and the cost of its main-

tenance is almost nominal.

   X. The system has had the advantage of being practically tested for more than
eighteen mouths upon an ordinary train running daily 250 miles and tested twenty-
two times each day and the result of this trial, as shown by the guard's daily

On the Physiological Action of Hydrate of Chloral.

   By Benjamin W. Richardson, M.D., F.E.S.

The following paper was drawn up by the desire of the President of the Biological

Section and tlie Department of Physiology during the Meeting. In opening the

subject, the author tirst expressed his thanks to Mr. Daniel Ilanbury, of Plough

Court, who had supplied him witli a specimen of the hydrate of chloral, and had

also been so good as to abstract from Liebreich's papers the piiucipal facts and

opinions on which the introduction of the hydrate into medical practice was based.

In brief, hydrate of chloral is a white crystalline body, soluble in water, and yield-
ing a solution not disagreeable to the taste. It is made by the addition of water

to the substance chloral. Chloral, the composition of whicli is C^IICl^ 0, is the

final product of the action of dry chlorine on ethylic alcohol. It is an oily fluid,

thin, colourless, volatile. The specific gTavity is 1-502 at 64° Fahr., and it boils

at 202' Fahr. It has a vapour-density of 7-"j, taking hydrogen as unit}'. The odour

Whenis pungent.  chloral is treated witli a little water, heat is evolved, and small

stellate white crystals are formed as the fluid solidifies. The solid substance is the

hydrate of chloral, C, IICl^ OIL, 0. The hydrate is slowly volatilized if it be ex-

posed to the air, and tlie odour of it, were it not pungent, is so like melon as to be

hardly distinguishable from melon. When heat is applied to the hydrate, it distils

over without undergoing decomposition.

  When to a watery solution of hydrate of chloral caustic soda or potassa is

added, the hydrate is decomposed, chlorofonn (CHCl.,) is set free, and a formate

of sodium or potassium, according to the alkali used, is formed. It was on a

knowledge of this decomposition by an alkali that Liebreich was led to test the

action of the substance physiologically. lie conceived the idea that in the living

blood the same change could be effected, aud that the chloroform would be libe-
rated so slowly that ana3sthesia of a prolonged kind would result. To try this, he

subjected animals to the action of chloral, and even man, and proved that sleep

could be rapidly induced without the second stage of excitement common to the

action of chloroform when it is given by inhalation. Liebreich produced in a

rabbit, by a dose of 0'5 grm. of the hydrate of chloral, a sleep which lasted nine

hours. This dose was equivalent to 0'35 of chloral, and to 0'29 of chloroform.

The symptoms, he found, were like those produced by chloroform. In some cases

he gave the hydrate to the human subject. The first case was that of a lunatic, to

whom he administered 1'35 grm. Xo irritation was set up, and five hours of

sleep was obtained. In a second case, he gave internally a dose of 3'5 grms. to

a man suftering from melancholia, by which he produced a sleep of sixteen hours.
                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                  223

   Sucli was an epitome of the facts placed before the author at the time when he
commenced to make his experiments. In setting- out on his own account, he first
prepared a standard solution of the hydrate. He found that 30 grains dissolved in

40 grains of water, and formed a saturated solution, the whole making up exactly

the fluid drachm. The standard solution prepared in this way was very con-

venient.

   The author next proceeded to inquire whether, hy the addition of the hydrate

to fresh blood, chloroform was liberated. This was proved to be the fact ; the

odour of chloroform was veiy distinct from the blood, and chloroform itself was
distilled over from the blood, and condensed by cold into a receiver.

   The narcotic power of the hydrate was then tried on pigeons, rabbits, and frogs.
The standard solution, named above, was employed, and was administered either
by the mouth or by hypodermic injection. The action was equally effective by
both methods. The general results were confirmatory of Liebreich's own expe-

--rience to a very considerable extent. They are as follows : In pigeons, weighing

from 85 to 11 ounces, narcotism was produced readily by the administration of

from I5 to 2^ grains of the hydrate. In these animals the doie of 2^ grains was
the extreme that coidd be borne with safety, and a dose of I5 grain was sufficient

to produce sleep and insensibility. The full dose of 2^ grains produced drowsiness
in a few minutes, and deep sleep with entire insensibility in twenty minutes.

Before going to sleep there was in every case, whether the dose was large or small,
vomiting. As the sleep and the insensibility came on, there was in every instance

a fall of animal temperatm-e, and even in cases where recovery followed, this de-
crease was often to the extent of five degrees. The respirations also fell in pro-

portion, declining in one case from 34 to 19 in the minute during the stage of

insensibility. From the full dose that could be borne by the pigeon, the sleep

which followed lasted from three and a half to four hours. Six hours at least was

required for perfect recovery. During the first stages of narcotism in pigeons the
evolution of chloroform by the breath was most distinctly marked.

In rabbits weighing from 8-3 to 88 ounces, thirty grains of the hydrate were re-

Aquired in order to produce deep .sleep and insensibility.  smaller do«e caused

drowsiness and want of power in the hinder extremities, but no distinct insen-

sibility.

  When the full effect is produced in rabbits from the administration of the larg«

dose, the drowsiness comes on in a few minutes ; it is followed by want of power
in the hinder limbs, and in fifteen minutes by deep sleep and complete insensi-
bility. The pupil dilates, and becomes irregular ; the respiration falls (in one case
from GO to .39 in the minute), and the temperature declines 6° Fahr. ; sensibility
returns with the rise in number of respiratory movements, but in some cases falls

again during the process of recovery. The di'owsiness, or, if the animal is left alone,

what may be called sleep, lasts from five and a half to six hours. But it was ob-

served that the period of actual ansesthesia was very short, lasting not longer than

half an hour, after which the skin seemed rather more tlian naturally sensitive to

touch. During recovery there are tremors of the muscles almost like rigors from

cold                    they are due probably to great failure of animal temperature.
                     ;

In frogs a grain of the hydrate causes almost instant insensibility, coma, and

death.

In further prosecution of his research, the author tested, on similar subjects, the

effect of chloroform, bichloride of methylene, tetrachloride of carbon, butylic
alcohol, and chloride of amyl. In all the observations with these substances, the

narcotizino- agent was used by hypodermic injection. It was found, as a result of

these inquiries, that 7 grains of chloroform, o of tetrachloride of carbon, and 7 of
chloride of amyl, produced the same physiological efl'ect as 2 grains of the hvdrate.
Seven grains of bichloride of methylene induced a shorter insensibilitv. A" rabbit

subjected to 30 grains of chloroform slept four hom-s and twenty-five minutes
and a pigeon subjected to 7 grains slept three hours and twenty-five minutes. All

these agents caused vomiting in birds, before the insensibility was pronounced,
the same as did the hydrate ; but in no animal was there any sign of the stage of
excitement which is seen when the same agents are administered by inhalation.
This fact is most important, as indicating the difference of action of the same

remedy by diiference in tlie mode of administration. The temperature of the body

was reduced by the agents named above, but not so determiuately as by the

hydrate.

  Two animals, pigeons, made to go into profound sleep, the one by the hydrate,

the other by chloroform (each substance administered subcutaneously), were

placed together, and the symptoms were compared. The sleep from the chloro-

form was calmer; there was freedom from convulsive tremors, which were pre-

sent in the animal under the hydrate, and recovery was, it was thought, steadier.
It was observed, and the fact was well worth}' of note, that no irritation was

caused in the skin or subjacent parts by the injection of the chloroform and other

chlorides.

The neutralizing action of the hydrate on strychnine was tried, and it was de-

termined that the substance arrests the development of the tetanic action of the

poison for a short period, and maintains life a little longer afterwards, but does not

avert death. This subject deserves further elucidation.

  When the hydr9,te of chloral is given in an excessive dose it kills : there are

continuance of sleep, convulsion, and a fall of temperature of full 8^ before death.
   The post-mortem appearances were noticed after a poisonous dose. The vessels

of the brain are found turgid with blood. The blood is Huid, and coagulation is

delayed (in a bird to a period of three minutes), but afterwards a loose coagulum

is formed. The colour of the brain-substance is darkish pink. The muscles ge-

nerally contain a large quantity of blood, which exudes from them, on incision,

freely. This blood coagulates with moderate hruiness. Immediately after death

all motion of the heart is found to be arrested. The organ is left with blood on

both sides, but with more in the right than the left side. The colour of the blood

on the two sides is natural, and the coagulation of this blood is moderately tu-m.

The other organs of the body are natural.
   Other observations were made on the changes which the blood undergoes when

the hj'drate of chloral is added to it. The corpuscles undergo shrinking, and are
crenate ; and when excess of hydrate is added the blood is decomposed in the

--same way as when treated with formic acid. The summary of the author's work

may be put as follows :

Hydrate of chloral, administered by the mouth or by hj-podermic injection,

produces, as Liebreich states, prolonged sleep.

   The sleep it induces, as Liebreich also shows, is not preceded by the stage of ex-
citement so well known when chloroform is administered by inhalation.

The narcotic condition is due to the chloroform liberated from the hydrate in

the organism, and all the narcotic effects are identical with those caused by chlo-

roform.

In birds the hydrate produces vomiting in the same manner, and to as full a

degree, as does chloroform itself.

The sleep produced by hydrate of chloral is prolonged, and during the sleep

there is a period of perfect anesthesia ; but this stage is comparatively of short

duration.

The action of the hydrate is (as Liebreich assumes) first on the volitional

centres of the cerebrum                                                                                         next, on the chord ;  and lasth', on the heart.
                                                                                                             ;

   Whether liytbate of chloral will replace opium and the other narcotics is a
point on which the author was not prepared to speak. It is not probable it will
supersede the volatile ansesthetics for the purpose of removing pain during the
performance of surgical operations, but it might be emploj'ed to obtain and keej)
up the sleep in cases of painful disease. This research had, however, led to the
fact that chloroform, when injected subcutaneously in efficient doses, leads to as
perfect and as prolonged a narcotism as the hydrate, with an absence of other
symptoms caused by the hydrate, and which are unfavourable to its action. This
was a new truth in regard to chloroform, and might place it favourably by the
side of the hjdrate for hypodermic use. Lasth-, as the hydrate acts by causing
a decomposition of the blood, /. e. hy undergoing decomposition itself and seizing

far this is useful or injurious reiuaius to be discovered. But while putting- these
views as to practical application at once and fairly forward, the author said it was
due to Licbreich to a<.ld that his (Liebreich's) theory and his experiments have
done fine service in a physiological point of view. They liave shown in one de-
cisi-\-e instance that a given chemical substance is decomposed in the living body
bj' virtue of pure chemical change, and that the symptoms produced are caused by
one of the products of that decomposition. The knowledge thus definitivelj^ ob-

             On the Matives of Vancouver s Island and British Columbia.

                                  By Dr. Richard King.

  --The natives are called Flat Heads, of whicli there are four varieties, the elon-

gated head from before backwards, the conical head, the square head, and the
elongated head from side to side. These artificial heads are produced by pressure
on the forehead and bandaging on the sides until the child is a year old. The au-

thor called this series of deformities the deformity aiii/icicd, in which there is
mere displacement of brain, or a conformity of error ; but he described a defor-

mity which is going on to a great extent in civilized life, which he named defor-
mity natural, or non-conformity of error, in wliich case it is not mere displacement
of brain, but an alteration of the oval shape of the brain, which he attributed to
the mode of nursing.

   The alteration that takes place in the Flat Heads is mere displacement of the
cerebral mass and of the cerebro-spinal fluid, which has neither mentally nor physi-

cally any deteriorating efiect. Tlie frontal sinuses are, however, almost entirely

obliterated ; but wliethcr the sense of smell is affected is a problem yet to be solved.

   The Flat Heads are peculiar to America, if we except the Avaren, a Turco-Ural
race inhabiting the countries between the l)ou and the ^'olg·a, and they are now re-
stricted to certain tribes in the neighbourhood of the Columbia River. The same
habit prevaik^d among the ancient Peruvians ; and it only shovs's the infant state of
the ethnologist, when Tiedemaun and I'entland maintained that these Flat Pleads
owed their singular configuration, not to art, but to a natural peculiarity.

   The native population of Vancouver's Island is estimated at 18,000, but, as in all

cases of estimates of the uncivilized races, wandering as they do, this estimate

cannot be relied upon. By far the most numerous and powerful tribes live on the
west coast, or on the outward sea-board of the island, and the white man is re-
spected by them. The natives generally are in a very degraded state ; occasionally
industrious trustworthy individuals are to be met with, but, as a body, for con-

tinuous labours they cannot be depended on.
   The fauna of the island is very rich, but the natives restrict themselves entirely

to lish, and a small esculent plant, called Caniass, which they collect and store up
for winter, and also coolc them as we do potatoes by boiling and bailing. The

Camass digging is a great season of reunion for the women of the various tribes, and

answers to our haymaking or harvest-home.

On the Occasional Definition of the Convolutions of the Brain on the exterior of

The general outline of the skull, with the exception of its base, is convex, pre-

senting a flowing curve. Occasionally, however, and perhaps more frequently in

the forehead than elsewhere, the outline of a convolution is so prominently defined

on the skull as to be very apparent on the exterior of the head through all the

integuments. Now, could we discover the cause whicli underlies this exceptional

configuration of the brain, we could scarcely fail of being much enlightened as to
the laws which preside over the development of this organ. Are we to regard

examination reveals gTeat differences in the proportion which the sizes of the con-

volutions bear to each other in brains of the same general size. In two foreheads

of the same breadth, for example in A, the conA-olutions seated in the mesial line

shall be much wider than in B, whilst iu B the lateral convolutions shall be much

wider than in A.

As iu different families or races the features of the face bear very different pro-

portions in size to each other, a certain average proportion being characteristic of

each, so with the convolutions and groups of convolutions of the brain. The theory

proposed Ijy the author as an explanation of the protuberance of isolated cerebral con-

\-olutions is, that either exercise or the crossing of races by marriage has caused off-

springs to be born with a predisposition towards the more energetic manifestation of

a function than the extent of surface allotted to it by the brain type of its race will

furnish that this extent of surface not being susceptible of being widened without
                                         ;

subverting the general packing and an'augement, and the proportion of the convolu-

tions and the figm-e of the brain as a whole belonging to the type, Nature effects her

purpose of enlarging an isolated organ by thrusting the skull outwards. This theory

requires that the cerebral convolutions most frequently protuberant shall be those ap-

propriated to functions which the progress of civilization has a tendency to cultivate

and render more active than they are found in a ruder state of society ; and if the

author is right in belie-ving that the convolutions which, in the frequency with

which they occm- defined on the exterior of the head, sm'pass all others are those

of the organs of music and causality, he thinks it must be admitted that so far the

test does not fail. Gall especially described two different forms of development

presented by the organ of music. . In some of the most eminent composers, the

external corners of the forehead are enlarged and rounded towards the temples,

giving extent of superficies to the organ without defining its outline. In others

equally celebrated, the organ presents a well-defined prominence in the form of a

pyramid, the base of which rests above the eye, whilst the apex reaches halfway

up the forehead and terminates at its exterior edge. Gall gives the Mozarts, father

aud sou, IMiehael Haydn, Pacr, Dusselc, Crescentini, and several others, as examples

of the first conformation ; Beethoven, Joseph Haydn, J. J. Eousseau, Gluck, &c.

as examples of the second                                                                                                                        and the author adds  to the list of gi-eat musicians pre-
                                                                                                                                              ;

senting the outline of the organ in a well-defined pyramidal form, the names of

Mendelssohn and Weber. He is acquainted with a lady who possessed from child-
hood an extraordinary genius for music, in whom the organ presents the first form.

The configiu'ation of the corners of the forehead is such as to provide a wide extent

of smface for the organ of music, but no defined outline is perceptible. This lady

married into a family singularly wanting in musical capacity. She has two

daughters, who, without equalling their mother in genius, inherit from her a

capacity for music much above the average. Their heads, however, follow in

general outline  the type of                                                                                                                     their  father's faniUy                                                                     they lack the spacious  temporal

region of their mother, and present the organ of music in the p^Tamidal form ; and this

form is beyond doubt that which is most commonly met with in England. On an

average the author has his attention arrested at least once in six montlis by seeing

a very conspicuous development of the organ of music in the pyramidal form in a

complete stranger; when circumstances permit he always endeavours to ascertain

whether the endowment with the faculty is commensurate with the development

of the organ, and he has never yet received a negative answer.

   On the Economical Condition and War/es of the Ar/ricultural Labourer in

               England. By Professor Leone Lett, F.S.A., F.S.S.

   1. That the great causes of low wages in Agricidture, as compared with other
industi-ies, appear to be the prevalence of physical labour and the permanent and

general excess of labourers.

   2. That it being highly important for the welfare of the labourer to raise the
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  227

 condition of agricultural labour from that of unskilled to skilled labour, it is neces-
sary to extend elementary education, to promote technical education among
farmers and stewards, and to offer liberal remuneration for superior skill and care-
ful working in any of the operations of farm-labom- by the extension of payment
by piecework, and the greater adoption of machinery.

    3. That, with a \-iew to the greater efBciency of labourers, nothing is more im-
portant than that the labourer should receiye wages sufficient to maintain him in
a condition of healtli and vigour.

    4. That, in order to modify the excess of labourers in agriculture, it is requisite
to remove any obstacle, by the law of settlement or otherwise, to the free removal
of labourers from county to county, to promote emigration direct from the country
districts, to extend the cultivation ot land, and to increase the commerce and
manufacture of the coimtry.

    5. That the difi'erence existing in agricultm-al wages in different counties in the
kingdom, though greatly modified by the allowance in kind in some of them only,
mainly arises from a greater or less excess of labour, greater or less efficiency of

labour, different degrees of productiveness of the soil, difference in the capital
invested in agricultm-e, and the presence of other industiies.

    6. That, for the purpose of encouraging the investment of capital in agricultui'e,
it is important to extend the custom of granting long leases, to secure compensa-
tions for agricultural improvements, and to remove any inequalities in the bm-den
of taxation wherever they exist, and to extend as far as possible railway accom-
modation in agricultural districts.

    7. That, having regard to the advantages connected with the system of yearly

hiring, as the best mode of securing a continuity of labour in the same service, and

of promoting the welfare and contentment of the labom-ers, it is highly desirable

to extend the custom in all comities, provided it may be introduced without the
objectionable practice of hiring fairs and markets, substituting for them registry

offices in all the market towns.

    8. That, whilst paj^ment in kind is objectionable, as it is liable to gi'eat abuse,

produces much uncertainty, throwing the dangers of the market on the party less
able to bear them, it is still more objectionable where any part of the wages is

paid in the shape of cider or spirits.

   That the bondage system prevailing in Northimiberland operates most imjustly

to the labom-er, and acts most disadvantageously on the moral condition of women

in that district.

    10. That, upon'a comparison of the purely agiicultm-al with the purely indus-

trial counties, the agricultural exhibit a smaller rate of births, deaths, and mar-
riages, a better state of education among the adults, especially among women,
nearly an equal proportional number of children at school, less diamkenness and
less crime, but more pauperism and more illegitimacy than the industrial coimties.

   11. That the house accommodation in the rural districts iippears to demand
decided improvement, many of the old cottages being inconsistent with the moral

and physical well-being of their inhabitants.

   12. That it were much to be desired that to every cottage a small gai'den

should be attached ; and that, where that is impossible, an allotment of land con-
Teniently situated should be granted with it.

   13. That for the purpose of stimulating habits of self-reliance and independence
of character among the agricultural labourers, it is most important to restrict as

much as possible tlie operation of the Poor-Law, to promote the establishment of

savings' banks, insurance companies, and friendly societies under proper control,
and to limit to the utmost extent the licensing of public-houses, and the inordi-
nate consumption of spirits.

   14. That, tailing into account the large excess of agricultural labourers, and the
probability of a stiU fm-ther displacement of labour in proportion with the intro-
duction of machinery and skill, the need of regulating the effiux of such labourers
to the towns and manufacturing districts in relation to the power of commerce
and manufactiires to absoib them, the importance of procuring the contentment
of such agricultural population, and the universal desire of the most industrious

among them to own a plot of laud or to farm it on his own account, as well as
                                                                                                 15*

the gi-eat adyantage of oft'ering means for the investment of sayings in the mode
most consonant with their habits, and in ahnost the only way within their reach,

it seems liighly expedient, even regardless of other economic considerations of a
conllicting character, that facilities should he alforded for the purchase of lots of
land of reasonable size, capable of being cultivated by the proprietors themselves,

that any laud now held by corporate or public bodies should be appropriated for
that purpose, and that in each estate, divided into large holdings, a limited num-

ber of small holdings, varying in extent from 30 to 100 acres, should be set aside,
 to ser\-e as stepping-stones for the labourer to rise to the position of a farmer.

    15. That it is important that the agricultural statistics published by the Board
of Trade should be extended, so as to show the number and extent of land-pro-
prietors, the number and acreage of farm-holdings, tlie wages of agricultural la-
 boiu'ers, and, as far as can be ascertained, the produce of the soil.

           0)1 certain Economical Iinprovements in ohtaining Motive Poiver.

                                    By Richard Eaton.

    Referring to the fact that work and heat are now generally admitted to be con-

 vertible terms, and showing that tlie steam-engine in its most improved state is

 not able to develope into useful work much more than one-tenth of the mechanical
 power due to the combustion of coal, the paper brought out the fact that whilst
 2218 heat-units would be the cost of obtaining 150 cubic feet of air at 60 lbs. pres-
 sure, to produce the same volume of steam at this pressure would require 29,350
 heat-imits. The improvements forming the subject of the paper were invented and

 patented by INlr. George Warsop, of Nottingham, with the assistance of the author

 of the paper.

    Cold air is taken in by an air-pump which is worked by an ordinary steam-engine,
 and the air is forced on, in its compressed state, through an air-pipe, past such
 parts of the flues and funnel as contain waste heat or gases, such waste heat being
 thus taken up by the air, which finally passes, at a temperature of about 600° Fahr.,
 by a self-acting- clack valve into the boiling water at the base of the boiler.
 Within the boiler the air is distributed, and rises through the water. The cohesion
 of the water is diminished by the presence of the air, and ebullition takes place
 more easily.

     Carefully conducted experiments on the plan adopted by the Royal Agricultural
 Society of England, and made by one of the consulting Engineers of the Society,
 proved that 47 per cent, more work was obtained out of a given quantity of fuel by
 this system than by steam only. Other advantages also were referred to ; and an
 announcement was made that the fullest possible investigations would be instituted
 and reported. It is to be hoped that the residts will be brought before the notice
 of the British Association at the Meeting next year.

LIST OF NEW WORKS

                        NOW READY.

A Copious and Critical English-Latin

                          Dictionary.

                      COMPILED FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES

By WM. smith, LL.D., and THEOPHILUS D. HALL, M.A.

                                                Medium 8vo, 21s., and square 12mo. 7s. Qd. (970 pp.)  {In February.)

It has been the object of the Authors of this work to produce a more complete and

more perfect Enqlisii-Latix Dictionary than yet exists ; and the long delay in its

publication has been owing to the time and labour necessary to execute this intention.

It has been composed from beginning to end preci.sely as if there had been no work of the

kind in our language. Every article has been the result of original and independent

research                                        the Authors  have  had the assistance  of several scholars in the preparation of
                                             ;

various j)arts of the work ; and it is no exaggeration to say that it represents the unre-

mitted and conscientious labour of nearly twelve years.

   In the preparation of the work the Authors have had a constant eye to its practical
use. Great attention has been paid to the arrangement of the different meanings of a
word, and to giving the conesponding Latin equivalent to every separate meaning. Each
meaning is illustrated bj' phrases from the classical writers, and these phrases are trans-
lated into English, in order to put their appositeness to a decisive test. Moreover,

the exact references are given to the classical writers from whom these citations are

taken, and the most scrupulous care has been bestowed upon the veritication of the
references. In the case of words for which there neither is nor can be any classical
equivalent, recourse has been freely had to more modera sources. But while special
terms have been taken from writers of various ages, in all that relates to the complexion
of sentences which involve a question of taste or style, the aim of the Authors has been
to follow in the steps marked out by Cicero and his contemporaries, or the writers of
what is called the Augustan age.

   By the order and an-angement of the different meanings under every word the teacher

will perceive that his pupil can use it without fear of being bewildered by its fulness, and
with the certainty of finding the Avord he wants.
