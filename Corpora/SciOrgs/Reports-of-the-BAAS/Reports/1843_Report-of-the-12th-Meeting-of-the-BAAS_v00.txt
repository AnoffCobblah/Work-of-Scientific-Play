                       ADDRESS

                  LORD FRANCIS EGERTON.

--Gentlemen, Some twelve years have now elapsed, since, by the exertions of

individuals, most of whom are now present, the prototype of this meeting was

held in the city of York ; and so successful was that first experiment, that it
has been annually repeated. The order and course of the proceedings of the
body there constituted and arranged, has not, I apprehend, been strictly
uniform, but I believe, on the whole, it has been usual, that on the occasion
of its annual assemblage, those proceedings should be open to some observa-
tions incidental to the occasion, on the part of the President ; and this pre-

liminary duty I am anxious, to the utmost of the very limited means of my

ability, to execute. In the earlier meetings of this Society, and on occasions

when the office I now hold has been filled by men distinguished by scientific
acquirement, it was, I believe, found possible and convenient for such Pre-

sidents to include in a preliminary discourse, a compressed but instructive
statement of past proceedings and present objects. The punctual and com-
plete observance of such a practice, indeed, could not be consistent with
those arrangements which admit to the occasional honour of your Presidency,
individuals, selected, like myself, not for any scientific pretensions, but from
the accidents of local connexion with the place, rather than the objects of
the assemblage. I apprehend that other reasons of equal urgency exist,
calculated to make this custom one of partial observance. The operations
of this Society have grown with its growth, and expanded with its strength

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and I am happy to believe that it would be difficult for the most able and
instructed of those with whose knowledge I am proud, for the moment, to
find my own ignorance associated, now to compress into reasonable limits,
and to reduce to terms adapted to a mixed audience, a satisfactory summary

of scientific proceedings, past and contemplated, connected with the labours of
this Society. If, indeed, I look to the proceedings of the last year's meeting
at Plymouth, I find some warrant for this supposition. You met last year,

--indeed, under different auspices. I cannot forget I wish for the moment

--you could how your Chair was then filled and its duties discharged. Could

you forget the fact, it were hardly to my interest to awaken your recollec-
tion to it, that such a man as Professor Whewell filled last year at Plymouth,
an office which I now hold at Manchester. I do so for the purpose of re-
marking that he, more able, perhaps, than any man living in this country to

give you a concise and brilliant summary of all that he and his fellow-
labourers are doing, forbore in his discretion from that endeavour. If he,
then, who is known in matters of science to have run

                        " Through each mode of the lyre, and be master of all,"

abstained from that undertaking, I may now be excused, not for my own

silence, which would require no apology, but for not calling on one of your

other functionaries to supply my place for the purpose.
   Slightly, indeed, before I sit down, I may presume to touch on one or two

topics which I may consider immediately illustrative of the advantages of
this Institution. In the first instance, however, allow me to indulge for a

moment in the expression of feelings of congratulation on the subject of the

particular locality which sees us here together. Guests and strangers will

--excuse me inhabitants, I think, will sympathise with me, if, as a neighbour,

and all but an inhabitant, I indulge in some avowal of complacency on this
subject. It is not merely that to this spot from which I now address you,

mechanical invention and skill have long been attracted as to one of their

principal centres ; nor that a neighbourhood so rich in mineral treasures
bears its own recommendation to the followers of several important branches
of natural science. These, with a host of other local reasons, might well

justify the selection of Manchester as a place of scientific assemblage. It

myhas, in  opinion, a claim of equal interest as the birth-place, and still the

residence and scene of the labours of one whose name is uttered with re-

spect wherever science is cultivated, who is here to-night to enjoy the

honours due to a long career of persevering devotion to knowledge, and to

receive, if he will condescend to do so, from myself, the expression of my

own deep personal regret, that increase of years, which to him, up to this

hour, has been but increase of wisdom, should have rendered him, in respect

of mere bodily strength, unable to fill, on this occasion, an office which, in

his case, would have received more honour than it could confer. I do

regret that any cause should have prevented the present meeting, in his

native town, from being associated with the name of Dalton as its President.

The Council well know my views and wishes in this matter, and that, could
my services have been available, I would gladly have served as a door-keeper

in any house where the father of science in Manchester was enjoying his just

pre-eminence.

myIt is no part, as I consider it, of  present office to discuss the reasons

which have induced others to suppose that I might hold it, at least, without

prejudice to the interests of the Society, or of this meeting. With those who
originated its efforts, who conceived its formation, and who have tended it

from its cradle in York to its present vigorous maturity in Manchester, I

respectfully leave my apology. In addressing to you any remarks on the

objects we are met to promote, I can only do so in one way, by endeavouring

--to convey to you the impressions of an unscientific man the reasons which

induce me, as such, to wish success to its operations, and to defer to the

judgment of those who have thought I might be of service in my present

position. All readers of German literature must have observed the frequent

--recurrence of a word which signifies the position from which an object is

viewed by the spectator the Standtpunkt, or place of standing, meaning

the place from which an object is viewed by a spectator, the position of

of the vast temple of science which, raised by successive architects, is daily

deriving new additions, is dim, and distant, and shadowy. Not even a prose-

lyte of the gate, far less a Levite of the sanctuary, I cannot mould my lips

to any Shibboleth of entrance ; and though I fain would worship at a distance,

the echo of the ritual falls too faintly on my ear to allow me to join in the
service of the altar. The pile is a vast one ; but who shall live to pronounce
it complete? New edifices are daily arising round the central structure.
Many a shaft remains to be polished, and many a capital to be elaborated into

new forms of fitness and of beauty. The architects, I know, are at work.

              ADDRESS.  XXX1U

I hear with you the clink of the trowel and the hammer. The builder is busy

on the ground from which Bacon cleared the rubbish of centuries, and shaped

the vast esplanade, the Moriah of philosophy, into a fit foundation for the

--subsequent erections of Newton and others. All this is going on, I may and

do congratulate you on the fact ; but it is not for me to describe and particu-

larize the progress of the labour. This will be done by the builders them-

selves in those sectional departments into which they have divided themselves-

There the geologist will teach and learn the results of recent research and

adventurous travel. Mr. Lyell is still, I believe, pursuing his investigations

in the distant regions of the New World, but Mr. Murchison is returned rich

witli the results of his exploration of an interesting portion of the Old, and to

tell you how highly and how justly such objects and such labours as his have

been appreciated, how honourably to himself they have been assisted and

promoted by the sovereign of those vast domains. With the political nature

or extent of that sovereign's power we have here nothing to do. Quid belli-,

cosus Cantaber aut Scythus cogitet is no subject for our thoughts or disquisi-

tions ; but his liberal appreciation of science, as evinced in the recent case of

my friend Mr. Murchison, is worthy of our warmest acknowledgments ; and

I trust that those distinguished men among his subjects who have honoured

us with their presence on this occasion, will bear back to him evidence of the

fact, that the followers of science in England duly appreciate his conduct

towards their countrymen. You will learn in those Sections through what

new channels the electrical inquirer has directed the fluid which Franklin

snatched from Heaven, into what shapes, and what service, the grasp of

science has compelled the imponderable Proteus it is his mission to enslave

to his bidding. The communication and the discussion of these past achieve-

ments, the suggestions of new methods and branches of inquiry which spring

from such discussion, are among the main purposes of our meeting, and the

volumes of this Society's Transactions bear ample witness to their accom-

Weplishment.  have, indeed, no longer to deal with conjecture in this respect

we have no longer an estimate to show, but an account, a profit, and a divi-

dend. It was well for the originators of this Society to enter into calculations

of prospective advantages, to foreshow that from personal intercourse and

collision, light and heat would be elicited, that dormant energies might be

excited in various parts of the country by the nomadic principle of this So-

ciety, that scientific operations which require simultaneous exertion on an

extensive scale, might derive their necessary element of combination, and

their necessary funds, from the voluntary association of men in this shape.

All this it was reasonable to predict, and fortunately it is no less easy now to

show that the prediction has been in all particulars of importance ratified by

--the result. It has been observed on more than one former occasion, it was

noticed on the last by my predecessor in the Chair, and at York in 1831,

that in the whole range of physical science Astronomy was the only one which

had, generally speaking, derived direct assistance from governments, or even

enjoyed what I may call the patronage of society at large. It was also re-

marked, with equal force and truth, that many other subjects are specially in

need of that species of assistance which the power of the State, or the opu-

lence of individuals, can afford to the otherwise solitary man of science. It

has come, as you well know, within the scope of the operations of this Society

to endeavour, in many instances, to meet and remedy this deficiency. To the

science of the stars the first rank in the table of precedence may indeed be

cheerfully conceded. Let it walk first in that dignity with which its very

nature invests it, but let it not walk alone. The connexion, indeed, between

that science and the State, between Greenwich and Downing Street, rests

 now upon the soundest principles of mutual advantage. It was not always
 thus that the astronomer found favour and footing in the councils of states-
 men and the courts of princes. Time was when the strange delusions of
judicial astrology reduced such men as Kepler to the level of Dr. Dee ; and
 it is melancholy to think how much of such a life as Kepler's was wasted in
 casting the nativities of princes, and calculating the fortunes of their foolish
 and wicked enterprises. The sun of science has drunk these mists. The tele-
 scope of a Wellington was pointed, not like that of Wallenstein from his ob-
 servatory in Egra on the heavenly host, but on the frowning masses of his

 country's foes. He knew but one, the Homeric omen, the defence of his

 country and the performance of his duty. Three centuries ago, a Mr. Airy
 might have been distracted from his intense and important labours at Green-

Wewich, to mark what star was culminating at the birth of a royal infant.

 do not now watch the configuration of the heavens on such events ; but to
 that Providence which has shielded the mother, and under that Providence to
 the love and prayers of a loyal people we cheerfully confide thefateand fortunes
 of the infant hope of England : still, though such delusions are swept away, it

 is impossible that in this maritime country the protection of the State should
 not in the first instance be accorded to the science which directs her fleets.
 Even here, as you well know, the labours of this Society have not been

wanting nor inefficient. Her advice has been followed, the contribution of
 her funds has been accepted. It is to the suggestion and the actual assist-
ance of this Society that the country owes the reduction of observations now
in progress under Mr. Airy ; and were this the only practical result of which
we had to boast, I might ask whether this were a mere trifling benefit con-
ferred upon the nation which has accepted it at your hands. On this parti-
cular point, were it in the least degree doubtful, I might hereafter find an
opportunity of appealing to Prof. Bessel, whose authority was specially quoted
on a former occasion, and who will shortly be here in person to support it.
Yes; and the railroad on Monday will convey in one of its carriages a most
important freight. Adam Smith says, that of all luggage man is the most
difficult to transport ; fortunately the difficulty is not commensurate with the

value of the article.

                                 " Weigh'd in the balance hero dust
                                               Is vile as vulgar clay."

Were it otherwise I doubt whether the workshop of my friends, Messrs. Sharp

and Roberts, could construct an engine of power sufficient to draw here in
safety a freight so illustrious as one which is shortly expected here by such
conveyance. If ever accident is destined to happen on the Birmingham and
Grand Junction rail-road, I hope it may be spared us on an occasion when
two such companions as Herschel and Bessel are trusting their lives to its

axles. May they convey to us in health and safety the illustrious stranger,

the accuracy of whose observations, and the grasp of whose calculations

have enabled him, if I am rightly informed, to pass the limits of our planetary
system and the orbit of Uranus, to expatiate extra fiammantia mama mundi,

and to measure and report the parallax and the distance of bodies, which

--no contrivance of optics can bring sensibly nearer to our vision and which

remain on the mirrors of our most powerful telescopes, the same points of
unextended light which they appeared to the Chaldean shepherd.

   I have been speaking of matters for some time past in progress, and no-
torious to all who have taken an interest in j'our proceedings. They are gra-
tifying as proofs that the impulse of this Society has been communicated and
felt in high quarters. It is surely desirable that, under any form of go-
          --

ADDRESS.  XXXV

vernment, the collective science of a country should be on the most amicable
footing with the depositories of its power; free, indeed, from undue control
and interference, not dangling in antechambers, nor wiping the dust from
palace staircases, uncontaminated by the passions and influences with which
statesmen have to deal, but enjoying its good will and favour, receiving and
requiting with usury its assistance on fitting occasions, and organized in such
a manner as to afford reference and advice on topics with respect to which

they may be required. One more recent instance of the operations of this
Society in this respect I may mention, in addition to those I have slightly

--enumerated. I do not refer in detail to other most important operations

which owe their origin to this Society the Magnetic Expedition now in pro-
gress ; the extension of the Trigonometrical Survey on an expanded scale, sug-

--gested by you, and liberally adopted by the Board of Ordnance these and

many other similar matters are recorded in your Transactions ; and to those
Transactions, rather than to any defective catalogue of mine, I would refer
those who may doubt the benefit of our labours. The most recent instance,
however, I cannot omit ; I mean the important accession to the means of this
Society of a fixed position, a place for deposit, regulation, and comparison of
instruments, and for many more purposes than I could name, perhaps even
more than are yet contemplated, in the Observatory at Kew. This building
was standing useless. The Council of the Association approached the throne
with a petition that they might occupy it, and I am happy to say that the
sceptre was gracefully held towards them ; and I think this transaction a

fair instance of that species of connexion between science and government,

which I hope may always be cultivated in this country. I am informed

that the purposes to which this building is readily and immediately appli-

cable, are of an importance which none but men advanced in science can
appreciate. You will hear further of them in the Committee of Recom-

mendations.

   With reference to the past transactions of the Society, it would be a pre-
sumption in me to enter upon any detail. I confess, however, that on looking

over the printed Transactions of the year 1839, my eye was caught by a pa-

ragraph of the introduction to Prof. Owen's treatise on the fossil reptiles of
Great Britain, in which he avows that but for the assistance of the Associa-
tion he should have shrunk from the undertaking of that work. The context
to this passage is a vast one. Those who wish to feel the entire force of the
commentary it conveys, must follow it through the pages of subtle disquisition
which succeed it. I ask you, learned and unlearned alike, to give but a glance

-- --at those pages. See how the greatest am I wrong in calling him so ? of

the British disciples of Cuvier walks among the shattered remnants of former
worlds, with order and arrangement in his train. Mark how, page after page,
and specimen after specimen, the dislocated vertebrae fall into their places,
how the giants of former days assume their due lineaments and proportions,
some shorn of the undue dimensions ascribed to them on the first flush of
discovery, others expanded into even greater bulk, all alike bearing the inde-
lible mark of adaptation to the modes of their forgotten existence, and preg-
nant with the proofs of wisdom and omnipotence in their common Creator.

This is a portion, at least, of the results of this Society. I select it for no-
tice, because it deals with a subject which comes, partially at least, within the

comprehension of those to whom algebraical formulae or the hieroglyphics

of mathematical science are a sealed letter.
    Gentlemen, I have endeavoured by these remarks to convey to you the ge-

neral reasons which induced me, an unscientific man, to wish this Society

success, and to endeavour to assist that success by any means at my disposal.
xxxvi    --REPORT 1842.

I would ask leave, before I conclude, to further illustrate these views and

feelings which are incidental to my own position, by reference to a scientific

transaction of no very distant date. Some two years ago, as I have under-

stood, an adventurous and scientific party, with Prof. Agassiz at its head, un-
dertook the ascent of that Swiss mountain, whose name indicates that it had

for ages been pronounced inaccessible to the foot of man. They applied,

however, to physical difficulties in this case the energies and perseverance
which have won them many triumphs over intellectual obstacles, and they

succeeded. I doubt not that there were many who, from the chalet and the

pasturage beneath, directed their glasses to those peaks of ice, and watched

with intent and thrilling interest the progress of those adventurers. Perhaps

among them were some who, by some trifling incursions into those awful re-

gions, in pursuit perhaps of the artist's or the hunter's pastime, had learned

to appreciate the dangers of the crevice, the toil of the ascent, cut step by step

with the hatchet in the precipitous ice, and the general magnitude of the en-

terprise. Be assured, you climbers of the heights of science, and there are

many of you here, that individuals so situated hail the progress they cannot

--share, that they sympathize with your advance, lament when you are baffled;

and that when you plant your flag on some hitherto virgin summit, their

--shout of applause would reach you from below, if it could be conveyed to

your organs by the pure and attenuated atmosphere it is yours, and yours

alone, to breathe. Dwellers in the peopled valley as we are, absorbed by

other cares, and I hope discharging other duties, breathers of a heavier and

Wetoo often tainted atmosphere, we yet can look upwards.  watch and

count your triumphs ; and as you gain them, wre gladly add your names to the

list of those who have done honour to their country and service to their kind.

For your labours have this privilege, that while their results become the com-

mon property of man, for that very reason, and because they confer that com-

mon benefit, they elevate the country in which they originate in the scale of

nations, and gratify the most reasonable feelings of national pride, while they

fulfil to the most unrestricted extent the obligations of our common hu-

manity.

            REPORTS

                               ON

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir J. Herschel, the

  Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, the Dean op Ely,

   Dr. Lloyd, and Colonel Sabine, appointed to conduct the co-

   operation of the British Association in the system of Simulta-
   neous Magnetical and Meteorological Observations.

  OURI Committee have great pleasure in being enabled to continue their

 hitherto favourable report of the progress of the important operations which
 they have been delegated to watch over ; and the extent of their operations
 being now vastly increased, by the addition of new foreign establishments

 tion of a system of colonial and national magnetic Surveys, based upon and

--ing great facilities for magnetic determinations to travellers both by land and

 sea, it will be convenient, both for clearness and precision, if we subdivide this

 our report into several distinct sections, according to the subject matter of

 these and other heads. And as offering grounds of the warmest interest and
 most lively sympathy to a British audience, we shall commence with the

       1. Antarctic Expedition

   Our last year's report brought down the account of the progress of the ex-
pedition to its departure from Hobart Town in November 1840. The pub-

lished extracts from the dispatch of Captain Ross, dated April 7, 1841, con-

taining the details of the brilliant success of the expedition in penetrating the

formidable barrier of ice, which had baffled the efforts of the French and

American navigators, (an achievement as daring as any which has illustrated

the annals of British nautical prowess,) and of his discovery of the great vol-

canic and lofty continent of Victoria in the previously unexplored seas far to

the southward of that bai'rier, must be too fresh in your recollection to need

any recapitulation in this report. It is with the magnetic observations and

results of the voyage only, that our immediate concern lies.

Landing on the Auckland Islands shortly after leaving Hobart Town, Cap-

tain Ross observed there the November term of 1840. Abandoning then, by

reason of the ill success of his predecessors in that direction, his original in-

tention of sailing across the isodynamic oval surrounding the point of maxi-

mum intensity, his adopted course led him between the two southern foci.

And although his return to the northward was by a more westerly route, it

seems probable that he was generally to the eastward of the present locality of

the greatest intensity. The magnetic observations accumulated in this voyage,

however, have only lately reached England. Their full import therefore can-

                                                                 --,

not yet be known ; but it is understood that intensities have been observed by
Captain Ross in these regions exceeding 2\ times the minimum observed by him
near St. Helena; and that intensities of this high value prevail with little

variation over a space extending from the 47th to the 77th degrees of lati-

tude The intensity in lat. 76°, where the nearest approach was made to the

magnetic pole, was found to be actually less than in 47°. The nearest ap-

proach to that interesting point, viz. the magnetic pole, was made in lat 76°

12', long. 164° east, the dip being between 88 and 89 degrees.

It was mentioned in our last Report that the publication of the magnetic

observations of the expedition had, at the request of the Admiralty, been

placed under the superintendence of Lieut. Col. Sabine. The first portion

of this work has been published in the Phil. Trans, of the present year, con-

taining the observations of intensity made at sea between England and Ker-

guelen Island. In this paper, the 3rd of a series of " Contributions to Ter-

restial Magnetism" which we owe to Col. Sabine's zeal and industry, the whole

series of interesting observations made on board each of the ships with Fox's

statical or deflecting magnetometer, are carefully analysed, projected, and rea-

soned on. The results are every way most satisfactory as regards the prac-

ticability of observing with precision at sea, in all sorts of weather; as a

proof of which, it will be necessary only to mention, that out of 647 observa-

tions of this kind made between London and the Cape of Good Hope, on

board the Erebus, one only was found so far irreconcileable with their general

tenor as to be declared doubtful : while the observations taken on board both

ships, when compared, exhibit a steady accordance which cannot be accidental,

and may well be termed beautiful. From this examination it would appear (if

earlier observations can be relied on) that the line of least intensity on suc-

cessive meridians in the middle and eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean is tra-

velling rapidly northward.

In addition to the sea observations, the expedition since our last Report

has made absolute determinations and observed terms as follow :

1840. Nov                   Auckland Island.
1841. May and June          Van Diemen Island.

July                        Sydney.

Aug., Sept, Oct., Nov       New Zealand.

The November term having been kept in the Bay of Islands, the expedi-

tion, according to the last letter received from Capt. Ross, dated Nov. 22, 1 841

was to sail thence the day following to resume the exploration of the Antarctic

regions. His intention, as stated in that letter, Avas to traverse the isodynamic

oval surrounding the focus of greatest intensity, supposed to be in lat. 60°,

long. 235° east, and steering thence directly south to the edge of the ice-pack,

to make, on reaching it, for the point at which the first year's exploration of
the coast of the new continent terminated, with intention to pursue the barrier,

wherever its course may lead. The working out of this arduous undertaking

may of course involve a winter spent within the antarctic circle. Should it

be otherwise, we may expect shortly to hear of the arrival of the expedition

at the Cape of Good Hope, or at the Falkland Islands *.

--2. British and Foreign Observatories. Extension of the periodfor which the

       British Establishments have been granted by the British Government.

All the British and Indian magnetic observatories, that at Aden excepted, as

 well as those Continental ones which can be regarded as intimately connected

--with and bearing partinthegreatoperations in progress areof course, and have

long been, in full activity. The Russian Government has been pre-eminently
active in the establishment of new observatories, and supported by the power-
ful protection of M. le Comte Cancrine, Minister of Finance, as well as
aided by funds placed at his disposal for the purpose by Prince Mentchikoff
and other Russian noblemen of distinction, the zealous and energetic director-
general of the Russian observatories, M. KupfTer, has succeeded in procuring

the establishment of magnetic observatories at Kasan, Barnaoul, Nertschinsk,
and Catherinebourg, and in bringing them by his personal exertions into a
 state of efficient activity, as well as in obtaining the re-erection of the old
and insufficient observatories of Tiflis and Nicolaijeff, and the prospect of a
new foundation for the same purposes at Moscow, under the auspices of Count
 Strogonoff, curator of the university of that city.

    This vast development of the original plan of operations, followed up as it
has been by almost every European power, has of course not been accom-
plished, to say nothing of expenditure, without the lapse of much valuable
time. The original term of observations granted by our own Government
and the East India Company, was three years, which expire in the current

--year just when in fact everything is come into full action, and the fruits of

so much labour and expense are beginning to be regularly gathered in, on a
scale commensurate to the exertions used. The necessary preparations, the

instruction of officers, their conveyance to their points of destination, the
building of observatories, the establishment and adjustment of instruments,
were all works of time. The first year of the term was necessarily thus oc-
cupied, and in some cases a considerable portion of the second ; so that in no
case has anything like the three years of actual observation contemplated,
been secured. Under these circumstances, and considering that a pause for
the present, and resumption at some future time of the observations, would
involve the breaking up of the whole system so auspiciously commenced, the
dismantling and decay of the existing observatories, the fresh initial expense,
delays, and difficulties of concerted organization in their re-establishment, it
was considered advisable by the President and Council of the Royal Society
that application should be made to Government on their part for the con-
tinuance of the observatories during another period of three years, to termi-

nate with the end of the year 1845. At the same time it was officially inti-
mated on the part of the Russian Government, that the Russian observatories
should be kept on as long as the British ; Baron Brunow at the same time
stating, that so far from supposing the period thus asked for long, his com-
munications led him to presume that it would be considered as the shortest
time in which the objects contemplated were likely to be accomplished, and
in which adequate returns could be made for the great exertions and outlay

occasioned in the establishment of the observatories.

   To these representations your Committee are happy to be enabled to re-
port that an unhesitating assent on the part of the British Government has

been given, and that in consequence the continuance of the general system for

three additional years must be considered secure. Whatever may be the

course of men's opinions as to the additional burdens recently imposed on the

country, men of science may at least congratulate themselves that their quota
of the general contribution will be devoted to objects which they cannot but

heartily approve.

   To this new period that which is on the point of elapsing must be consi-
dered (independent of the rich and valuable results it has yielded) as a pre-

paration of incalculable value, since whatever modifications and improvements,
                                                        b2
--4 REPORT 1842.

under a revised system of instructions, it will be found necessary to introduce,
will now be based on mature experience, and adopted with sound deliberation.
Uniformity can now be insisted on in points which were necessarily at first
open to peculiarities of local and individual practice. Hourly in place of two-
hourly observations may possibly be found generally practicable. Instrumen-
tal corrections, and especially that for the temperature of the magnets, which
has proved to be the most important of all, as well as the most difficult to as-
certain, will have been accurately determined, and can henceforward be con-

fidently applied.

    But in regarding what has been done as preparatory to what is to follow,
we are not to lose sight of its actual independent value. Were it only on ac-
count of its affording so vast a basis of comparison with the itinerant results
of the antarctic expedition, it would have been inestimable. The demonstra-
tion it has afforded of the ubiquity over the whole globe of those singular dis-
turbances to which the name of Magnetic Storms has been applied, could
have been no otherwise obtained, and is in itself a physical result of the first
importance. The data it has afforded for the revision of the Gaussian theory
are numerous, and beyond all comparison more exact than any which had ever
before been collected. In a word, were the series broken off at this point,
though we must have grieved to find ourselves arrested in full career, we
should stillhave found cause to regard the operation as conspicuously successful.

                                            3. Magnetic Surveys.

  --Southern Africa. Lieut. Clerk, R.A., who is noticed in the last Report as

having been ordered by the Master-General of the Ordnance to join the mag-
netic observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, in anticipation of an application
for this survey, arrived at the Cape in December, and has since taken part in
the duties of the observatory as assistant to Capt. Wilmot. In the estimate
which has been forwarded to the Treasury of the expenses of the magnetic
establishments under the department of the Ordnance for the newly autho-
rized period, Lieut. Clerk and one additional gunner are included in the
strength of the Cape observatory, the survey having been made part of the
duties of that establishment. It is proposed that the survey shall comprehend,

in addition to the colony itself, as extensive a portion of the earth's surface in
all directions from the observatory as time and circumstances will permit.

Application has been made to the Admiralty (who have on all occasions shown
the utmost readiness to promote magnetical inquiries.) to permit the sea por-
 tions of this survey to be carried into execution by occasional opportunities
which the Admiral at the Cape station may be able to afford without prejudice
to the public service in other respects, in Her Majesty's ships and vessels
 under his command. This will include the coasts of Africa on either side of

the Cape. When this portion of the survey shall have been considerably ad-
 vanced, we shall be better able to judge of the expediency of completing the

 circle by an excursion into the interior. With a view to this, inquiries have
 been set on foot at the Cape, and answers received from the colonial autho-
 rities in the commissariat and surveying departments, relative to the most de-
 sirable route, the strength of the party, time required, mode, and probable
 cost of transport and subsistence, &c. The Geographical Society have also

 furnished notices of high interest as to the points of geographical discovery

 (including the discovery of the Great Lake in the interior of South Africa,
 whose existence is considered certain, but which has never been visited by
 any European), which might be accomplished consistently with the objects of
 such survey.

  --North America. Lieut. Lefroy, R.A.,has been appointed successor to Lieut.
       ON MAGNETICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 5

 Riddell, in the principal direction of the observatory at Toronto, and of the
survey there, which, as at the Cape of Good Hope, is made a part of the ge-
neral duties of the establishment. Having been relieved at St. Helena by
Lieut. Smyth, Lieut. Lefroy is now in England preparing instruments for the
survey, and will proceed to America in a few weeks. Since Lieut. Riddell's
return to England in January 1841, on account of health, the observatory at
Toronto has been conducted in the most satisfactory manner by Lieut. Young-
husband on the excellent system established there by Mr. Riddell. Exten-
sive as is the field of research which now opens in that quarter of the globe,
and arduous as will be the task of profiting duly by the opportunities likely
to be afforded, the zeal, intelligence, and perseverance which have been al-
ready shown by Messrs. Lefroy and Younghusband, give the best assurance
of the good performance of the further service entrusted to them. The Hud-
son's Bay Company, with its accustomed readiness to promote scientific in-
quiries of all kinds in their extensive territories, have most liberally under-
taken to furnish conveyance in the summers of 1843, 1844, and 1845, over
the countries to the north and west of Canada, extending to the shores of
Hudson's Bay and to the Pacific Ocean, and have made the further offer of
a passage in one of their annual ships from Hudson's Bay to England, so as
to include in the survey the interesting magnetic region of Hudson's Bay
and Straits.

   The operations thus contemplated in the north will connect themselves
with magnetic surveys actually in progress by several distinguished magneti-
cians in the United States. Mr. Bache has during the last summer com-
pleted the systematic survey of Pennsylvania, commenced in the preceding
year, including the three elements of Declination, Inclination, and Intensity.
Professor Loomis has extended his series of observations of the Inclination
over many parts (previously unvisited by him) of the States of Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, and Missouri. M. Nicollet has also observed in the same region, and
Dr. Locke has added a contribution. These and other similar operations
which we may expect in the United States, from the increasing interest which
magnetism excites there, will connect the Northern British survey with the
determinations of Captain Barnett, R.N., commanding H. M. S. Thunder, on
the southern coasts of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico. Cap-
tain Barnett is well provided with instruments both for sea and land observa-
tion, and has shown himself a zealous and careful observer.

                                 4. Observations made at Sea.

   It has already been stated in the last year's Report, that by the use of Mr.
Fox's instrument the inclination or dip, and the magnetic intensity may be mea-
sured at sea, if not with absolutely the same pi'ecision as at land, yet with a
precision quite as great as is requisite for every possible use to which obser-
vations at sea can be turned, that is to say, for the purpose of tracing out the
isodynamic and other magnetic curves in the portion of the globe occupied by
water ; and the probable absence of local attractions and disturbances in open
ocean, while it renders such curves more easily traceable, so it affords a ready
method of checking each particular observation by reference to the chain of
determinations of which it forms a part. To extend and facilitate the use of
this valuable instrument, a set of instructions for its use has been drawn up
by Col. Sabine, and printed by the Admiralty for general circulation. The
use of this instrument has been adopted by Captain Blackwood in his sur-
veying expedition to Torres Strait, and the same system of daily observation
is practised with it, as in the Erebus and Terror ; and the example it is to be
hoped will be followed, not only in voyages designed expressly for purposes
--6 REPORT 1842.

of survey and exploration, but in ships pursuing ordinary tracks, so as at
length to furnish data for the construction of complete magnetic sea-charts,
founded on observation alone, for these important elements, as well as for
the declination.

    For the formation of such charts, however, it is necessary to eliminate the
influence of the ship's iron, an influence which the continually increasing
quantity of iron on board of vessels renders an evil of great and increasing
magnitude. Instructions for this purpose, as regards the declination, have
also been issued by the same authority, founded on the experience obtained in
our arctic expeditions, and embodied in rules which are substantially the same
with those given by Col. Sabine in his paper in the Phil. Trans, on Compass
Deviations on board the Isabella and Alexander in the arctic voyage of 1818,
consisting in simultaneous sea and shore observations, and reciprocal bearings
with the ship's head laid in succession round every point of the compass.

    In reference to contributions made to our knowledge of the magnetic ele-
ments in various parts of the globe, it would be unjust to omit the mention
of the. valuable series of such determinations made by Captain Belcher, R.N.,
of H. M. S. Sulphur. These determinations, the first portion of which have
been reduced by Col. Sabine, and published in the Phil. Trans, for 1841,
have been continued by Captain Belcher at more than 20 stations in the
islands and coasts of the Pacific and China Seas. The observations are
arrived in England, and will shortly be reduced, forming altogether a very
valuable contribution towards the data accumulating for the revision of the
numerical elements of Gauss's Theory.

    Still less pardonable would it be in this Report to omit signalizing the final
publication during the last year of Professor Erman's magnetic results in his
journey into Siberia and voyage round the world. It is true that these results
are already in part interwoven with the numerical computations of M. Gauss's
magnetic coefficients, and so constitute an integrant part, and a most import-
ant one, of that vast and laborious work. But this has been by the especial
favour and liberality of that eminent traveller, in placing at the disposal of
those engaged in theoretical researches, results to them invaluable, and which
have actually proved most useful even without that final revision and labo-

rious reduction which he has ultimately given to them. When we consider

the vast extent of sea and land traversed by this indefatigable traveller, his
long residence in the dismally cold and inhospitable regions of Siberia, the
infinite labour of the observations themselves, and the care with which they
have been made, we shall see reason to regard this work as one which must
constitute an epoch in the history of magnetic science, both for the mass of
information it contains and the personal devotion it indicates.

                                         5. Magnetic Disturbances.

   M. Gauss truly remarks, that " It is one of the great results of British

enterprise, that the existence of disturbances extending over the whole globe has

been ascertained." As a physical fact deeply connected with the general
causes of terrestrial magnetism, this is indeed a result of the first magnitude

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and its consideration under all its circumstances, and especially as modified
by distance and geographical locality, is eminently calculated to lead to spe-
culations on those causes, and to theoretical views tending to connect these
abrupt variations with the usual course of the magnetic phaenomena. To dis-
connect, in the phaenomena of the magnetic storms, what is local from what
is general, and to trace individual shocks occurring in them from observa-
tory to observatory, and from station to station, until they become so far en-
feebled by the effects of distance from their origin as to be confounded and

 masked by the growing influence of other shocks whose point of action is
 nearer, is now one of the principal points to which attention must be directed.
 The great mass of the magnetic bars used for the regular determinations, and
 for observations of small and moderate disturbances, throws some obstacles
 in the way of this inquiry, when the changes of magnetic force are very sud-
 den and irregular, which seems more likely to be prosecuted effectually by
 the use of very small bars capable of being instantly affected by short and
sudden shocks. But however this may be, the occurrence of many and re-
 markable storms during the continuance of these observations, at the most di-
 stant localities, and with all their detail of circumstances, has given a very
 high degree of immediate interest to this branch of the inquiry, and occa-
 sioned a change in the contemplated order of publication of the reports. It
has been considered advisable to collect together from all the returns the cases
of remarkable disturbances observed, arrange them in chronological order,
and publish them in volumes by themselves. Those of 1840 and 1841 will
appear in the course of the summer. By pursuing this course it alone be-
comes practicable to mature such a plan of extra or storm observation (whe-
ther by the use of smaller needles or by other processes which will suggest
themselves,) as can be fairly tried and effectually brought into action while

the colonial observatories still subsist. Among those which will be included

in this first publication, the great disturbance which took place on and about
the 25th of September, 1841, though not the greatest in point of actual devi-
ation which has occurred, is yet in many respects one of the most remarkable.
It was observed at Greenwich and immediately made the subject of a circular
communication addressed by the Astronomer Royal to his brother observers.
Speedily accounts" dropped in of the observation of the same disturbance at

outlying stations, from Toronto, from St. Helena, from the Cape of Good
Hope, nay, even from Trevandrum in Travancore. All these accounts ar-
rived in time to be inserted in the Report of this Association for 1841, and
it must surely be regarded as a signal proof of the efficiency of the arrange-
ments made on all hands, that a phsenomenon, casual in its nature so far as
we yet see, and manifested by no external and visible premonitory symptoms,
should have been thus seized upon by our observers in Europe, Asia, Africa
and America, reported thence to England, reduced, printed and circulated
in three months and a week after its occurrence. " Tantum series June-

turaque pollet" /*
   Anomalous magnetic movements of unusual magnitude take place on the

average 3 or 4 times in the month, but apparently with greater frequency
in some months than in others. The returns from the different stations
show hitherto without exception that these disturbances are general, that is

to say, that though the movements individually may not be, and in fact are
not, always simultaneous, the observations of the same day never fail to ex-

hibit unusual discordances at all the stations. Generally the disturbances
are characterized by a diminution more or less of horizontal intensity, pre-
vailing more or less for several hours together, everywhere, and mostly ac-
companied by a movement, also general, of the north end of the needle to-

wards the west. By a memorandum of Lieut. Younghusband on the disturb-
ance on the night of the 15th April 1842, which was so considerable that the
range of the declination in little more than an hour extended over 2° 15' in

arc, it appears that with the 15-inch bars used in the observatory, which re-
quire 17 s for a vibration, a change of more than 50 divisions of the scale, or

which was observed by him at Munich,) the movements exhibited no correspondence, taken
seriatim, with those at Greenwich.

35 minutes of arc, occasionally takes place in the time required for the three
vibrations which give the mean place entered in the tables.

    Experience has somewhat diminished the value of the term observations as
a principal means of detecting disturbances ; especially since our observatories
have adopted hourly observations, by which a departure from the normal
state cannot continue long without notice ; and thus the disturbance furnishes,
of itself, at all the stations, a natural signal for extra and simultaneous ob-
servation. Besides our Colonial and East India observatories, the disturbances
are watched with the greatest diligence at Prague, Munich, and Greenwich.

            6. New Magnetic Instruments and Modes of Observation.

  --Transportable Magnetometer. Among the most useful services that have

 been rendered to the magnetic cause in the year elapsed, has been the ma-
 king this a thoroughly practical instrument, and the instructions which have
 been drawn up by Mr. Riddell for its use. These instructions are now in
 progress of printing. They are of the most distinct and practical kind, and
 contain the formulae of correction and reduction with numerical examples
 from actual practice. This instrument and the instructions for its use, freely
 supplied to officers of the army and navy, will multiply absolute determina-
 tions, teriu observations, and disturbance observations far beyond what could
 ever be done by fixed observatories, and also in localities where such could
 not be established. Already have these improved instruments been supplied
 to the ships of Capt. Blackwood and Capt. Sulivan, the first proceeding to
 survey Torres Strait, and the latter the Falkland Islands, and the officers have
 been instructed in the use of the instruments at Woolwich. Another has
 been supplied to Mr. Lefroy, and will enable him to keep the terms in what-
 ever part of America he may find himself on the days appointed. Others are
 preparing for Capt. Barnett and Capt. Grove, R.N., who are engaged in sur-
 veys at Bermuda and Malta, both being stationary for several months in the
 winter. From Capt. William Allen, R.N., of the Niger expedition, we have
 received the November and December terms, 1841, kept at Ascension, with
 the original German transportable magnetometer, as also the absolute deter-

--minations made with it in the same island.
     Professor Lloyd's new Inclinometer. The vertical element of the magnetic
 force is one of difficult determination with that precision which is required to
 become comparable with the determinations of its horizontal component, so as
 to afford a perfectly correct means of calculating the changes of the incli-
  nation and of the total intensity. The instrument hitherto used for the
  purpose, called by Prof. Lloyd the Balance Magnetometer, has been found

  scarcely adequate to its intended purpose. " Unexceptionable as its principle
  is in theory, the accuracy of its results has not been commensurate with that
  of the others. This inferiority is owing to the large influence which the un-
  avoidable errors of workmanship necessarily have on the position of equili-

  brium of a magnet supported on a fixed axle." " The sources of error seem
  to be inherent in every direct process for determining the third element, and
  it is only by an indirect method that we can hope to evade them."* Such a
  method has accordingly been recently proposed and subjected to trial by Dr.
  Lloyd, by means of an instrument to which he has given the name of an
  Induction Inclinometer, the principle of which is the measurement of the
  intensity of the magnetism induced on a vertical bar of soft iron (which must be
  considered as due to the vertical magnetic component only) by the deviation it
  is capable of causing in a horizontal bar suspended near it. The details of

the construction and adjustments of this instrument are given in the work

--cited below.
    Weber's Inductive Inclinometer. Similar in respect of its general principle,

but widely different in the mode of application of that principle, is a recent

invention of M. Weber for the same purpose. The deflection of the horizontal

magnet in this instrument is produced by the earth's magnetism, induced not

on a vertical soft iron bar at rest, but on a ring, sphere, or plate of copper

made to revolve about a vertical axis with a perfectly uniform and given ve-

locity by clockwork. This ingenious instrument has not been tried in Eng-

-- Aland, but is stated by M. Kupffer to perform very satisfactorily.
M. Lamonts Inclinometer.       third and much less simple mode of ac-

complishing the same object of measuring the intensity of the earth's mag-

netism by its inductive power has been devised by M. Lamont. As in Dr.

Lloyd's process, a bar of soft iron is used as the temporary magnet, but in

other respects the application of the general principle is widely different.

The bar so temporarily magnetized is made to act unequally on the two

bars of an astatic magnetic couple, thereby tending to draw them aside from

a given position in which they would otherwise be held by a fixed magnet of

given power. This tendency however is destroyed by another magnet placed

Ain a given position and distance.  series of reversals and changes of di-

stance in the soft iron bar and the neutralizing magnet is then operated, which

furnishes equations by which everything but the intensity sought and known

quantities can be eliminated.

  7. Publication of Magnetic Observations, Descriptions of Observatories, fyc.

   As it is not by any means the object of this Report to give a historical

view of the progress of magnetic science generally, except in so far as the
immediate purposes for which your Committee is constituted are concerned,

--and as bearing on the practical operations over which they are delegated by

the Association to watch, it must suffice under this head to notice very
briefly the appearance of several works and memoirs, in which observations
are recorded or discussed, instruments and observatories described, &c.

   None of the returns of the regular observations at our stations are as yet
printed ; but, as has been noticed, those of the disturbances in 1840 and 1841
will appear in the course of the present year. In this respect however we
are not more in arrear than our Russian coadjutors, the observations made
in the whole extent of which empire under the superintendence of M.
Kupffer, for the year 1839, have appeared in the course of 1841, forming the
regular continuation of that noble collection, the " Annuaire Magnetique et
Meteorologique du Corps des Ingenieurs des Mines de Russie". Nor indeed
does it seem practicable in works of this vast extent, and where the returns
have to arrive from such distant quarters, to place a much less interval be-
tween the making and publication of the ordinary observations.

   The year elapsed has also been marked by the publication of the first vo-
lume of the magnetic and meteorological observations made at Prague by M.
Kreil, containing the observations from July 1, 1839 to July 1, 1840; a sin-
gular departure from the usual and far more convenient practice of packing
together in the same volume the observations of each separate year. In this
work the observations are not only registered, but very amply discussed and
reduced, and the daily, monthly, and yearly march of the results investigated.
The suspected influence of the moon on magnetic and meteorological phse-
nomena is made a subject of especial discussion by M. Kreil.

   M. Quetelet continues his praiseworthy labours in collecting and project-

ing meteorological observations on the solstitial and equinoxial term days.
--10 REPORT 1842.

These, and his observations of the magnetic terms with their graphical pro-
jections, continue to be regularly published by him in the Bulletins of the
Royal Academy of Brussels.

    Dr. Lloyd, Dr. Laraont, and Messrs. Lovering and Bond have respectively
furnished descriptions of the magnetic observatories under their direction at
Dublin, Munich, and at Harvard University, Cambridge, N. S. In the last-
mentioned of these works (published in the Memoirs of the American Acade-
my of Boston,) are also printed the term observations made in 1840 and the
commencement of 1841 at that Institution, projected, and in the case of the
term of Oct. 21, 1840, compared with the corresponding observations at
Toronto (as regards the declination), and exhibiting (conformably to what has
been found to obtain in stations not more distant from each other in Europe)
a close and minute agreement in the march of the deviations, which on that
occasion was very irregular.

    Dr. Lamont's observations are characterized by the use of very small
needles. Some anomalies appear to have been produced in their readings by
circulating currents of air arising from inequality of temperature in their
glass inclosures ; but these he has succeeded in great measure in destroying.

Indeed there seems no good reason why such needles should not be sus-

pended in vacuo. Assuredly if very small needles could be used in place of
large ones, (for those observations, that is to say, which do not depend on
observed times of vibration, for to such they are quite inappropriate,) not only
would the costliness of apparatus be much diminished, and its portability in-
creased, but the temperature corrections would become more certain, by rea-
son of the rapid distribution of heat through the whole extent of the needle,

(neither would there probably be found much difficulty in keeping such
needles constantly up to a definite state as to magnetic saturation) not to re-
fer again to what has been already said of their applicability to a closer ana-

lysis of the shocks producing irregular disturbances.

   Dr. Lloyd's paper may be advantageously referred to for a full account of

the construction, adjustments and mathematical theory of all the magnetic in-
struments employed, and in this respect must be considered as a very useful
and valuable contribution to the cause in hand.

    Col. Sabine has reduced and discussed during the past year the observa-
tions of Capt. Belcher on the west coast of America and at Otaheite in the
second series of his " Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism" published in the
Phil. Trans., 1841, and in his third series of such contributions has passed
under examination the sea observations of intensity made onboard the Erebus
and Terror in the voyage from England to Kerguelen's Land.

    Professor Loomis's observations of intensity and dip in several stations in
the United States, made in the years 1838, 1839, 1840, have also appeared in
the year elapsed.

    The subject of the mutual action of permanent magnets, with a view to
their best relative position in an observatory, has been resumed by Dr. Lloyd
in a supplement to his former paper on that subject published by the Royal
Irish Academy. Choosing among the incompatible conditions which a total
destruction of the mutual actions of three magnets would require those of
most importance to satisfy, he has been enabled to propose several arrange-
ments adapted to specific purposes, which accomplish their object with great
simplicity and convenience.

   A considerable extent of correspondence has taken place on the important

subjects of the best formula to be used and method to be adopted for deter-
mining the absolute intensity of a magnet by deflection observations, Mr.

Airy contending for the inadequacy of Gauss's formula, and proposing a

different method, and Dr. Lloyd for its practical sufficiency. The subject

must be considered as still under discussion, and the necessary revisal of the
instructions for the new period will either cause both methods to be practised,

or otherwise bring the point to a satisfactory issue. Opportunity will also be

afforded for attention to many other valuable practical suggestions which

have been offered as the result of experience already gained ; such as Mr.

Lamont's correction for change of magnetism in the deflecting bar in the
same class of experiments, when in the meridian, and when perpendicular to

it ; as also Dr. Lloyd's determination of the ratio of the distances of the de-

flecting bar which shall give the smallest possible error in the resulting in-

tensity corresponding to a given force of deflection, and his suggestion re-

specting the employment of the bifilar suspension for the purpose of magni-

fying small declination-changes, whether such changes require to be mea-

sured for ascertaining the temperature correction of a deflecting magnet, or

simply for their own sake, at stations near the equator where they are habitu-

ally very small.

   No expense beyond a charge of 10/. 8s. lOd. for observatory registers sup-
plied to Mr. Boguslawski for the new period of three years, has been incurred,

but your Committee pray a continuance of the remainder of their grant to
meet such demands as may arise.

   " I have received with great pleasure, although much retarded, your es-
teemed communications of May 19th, 1841, and January 11th, 1842, as well
as the highly interesting inclosures, but am still in expectation of the arrival

of the requiredforms, as also of the new books for observations of this year,

from 2 to 2 minutes. They will however arrive in time, because for this year

past, extraordinary obstacles to the labours of the observatory have taken

place, which however have now been happily removed. The only assistant
who was associated with me was suffering under a complaint of the chest,

which rendered him incapable of continued work. The labours thereby fallen
to my share were increased by the death of Dr. Scholtz, Professor of Mathe-
matics, part of whose lectures I was obliged to take upon me until his place

was supplied again.

" Not without much exertion I have taken care, that all the magnetic term

observations were made complete, and that everything was prepared to proceed

presently to the absolute observations under more favourable circumstances,

as also not to omit observations of perturbations out of terms.

" During the vacancies of the Easter holydays I have caused to be made for

that purpose, not without difficulty, a deep blind (niche) within the old thick

and strong wall of the tower, in order to get thereby sufficient room for ob-

servations of deviations of the declination needle also in the westerly direction.

I place much confidence in the new assistant, who is to arrive by the 1st
July, and live in hope that my request for a second assistant will be acceded

to, so that the magnetic observations will be continued with redoubled zeal,
and more time can then be given to the forming of the abstracts and registers

for you.

the British Association, and to present to them at the same time my most

12 REPORT-- 1842.

Report on the present state of the Ichthyology of IVetv Zealand. By
   John Richardson, M.D., F.R.S., Sfc., Inspector of Naval

   Hospitals, at Haslar.

Now that New Zealand has become the adopted home of thousands of our

countrymen, whose numbers are daily receiving fresh accessions, and whose

efforts are primarily directed to the overthrow of the native forests with a

view to their replacement by farm-houses, verdant pastures, rich crops of the

cerealia, and the other accompaniments of a successful agriculture ; we may

expect that a corresponding change will follow in the distribution of animals.

Some will become rare or perhaps entirely disappear, while others, casually

or intentionally introduced, and finding appropriate food and protection, will

increase, and people the land. It is of importance to zoology that the num-

ber, range and habits of the animals should be ascertained and recorded be-

fore the din and bustle of civilisation scare them from their native haunts

and it was with the view of facilitating the execution of such a task, that

J. E. Gray, Esq. of the British Museum, and I undertook, on the recommenda-

tion of the general committee assembled at Plymouth, to draw up a report,

of which the present paper is a part.

The islands of New Zealand crossing thirteen degrees of latitude, and pos-

sessing from their narrowness and their remoteness from continents, a purely

maritime climate, are well situated for showing how far the distribution of

animals is influenced by an increasing distance from the tropic, independent

of other considerations. Several able zoologists have gone to reside in this

the most remote of our colonies, and it is to them that we look for an accu-

mulation of facts bearing on this question, before the unwearied assiduity

and continual progress of the Anglo-Saxon race, and the ravages of the do-

mestic beasts of prey which follow in their train, shall have compelled the

various species to overpass the demarcations of their ancient ranges, which

could have been but little disturbed by the operations of the thinly scattered

aboriginal inhabitants. These observations apply more extensively to the

birds than to the other vertebrata, for quadrupeds are very rare in New

Zealand, Cook having observed only two, the dog and rat, and Polack, in his

recently published popular account of the Colony, says that it nourishes no

serpents or snakes of any description. Three individuals of the genus Pela-

mys were indeed thrown ashore on a piece of timber ; but from the way in

which the fact is mentioned, I suppose that they were destroyed by those

Awho witnessed the descent.  large agama (Hatteria, Gray) is known to

the settlers by the name of iguana, but it is now scarce, having been nearly

extirpated by wild cats sprung from the introduced domestic race.

   Mr. Gray with the assistance of his brother has prepared a list of the birds,

and also drawn up one of the reptiles and invertebrata known to inhabit New

Zealand ; but he has lately received an accession of specimens which require

time for examination, and has therefore found it expedient to defer his report

to another year, that he may be able to present it in a more complete state.

The fish have hitherto been more neglected than the other vertebrata or the

mollusca, and had I designed to draw up an orological report, or to make ex-

tended observations on the peculiarities of organization exhibited by the fish

which inhabit the seas of New Zealand, I must also have deferred this paper
until materials accumulated ; but my object is the much more humble though
still useful one of furnishing the naturalists now at work on the ichthyology

of those distant seas with a list of the known species and references to their

figures and published descriptions.

It is to the accurate observers who accompanied Cook on his first and

second voyages, that we are indebted for almost all that is known of the fish
of New Zealand. They figured or described upwards of sixty-five species, to
which nine have been added by Cuvier and Valenciennes in their admirable
' Histoire des Poissons,' and sixteen by other writers, making in all ninety.
Even in this small list it is to be feared that in two or three instances the same
species is mentioned more than once under different names.

   From the great prolongation of the islands in a north and south direction,

the deep indentations of their coast-lines, the different exposures of their bays,
the variety of the beaches, the existence of sand-banks off their shores, their

numerous rivers and interior lakes, we should expect to find them rich in
fish, and in fact Polack says that few countries possess a greater abundance
or variety of the finny tribes. There is no place in the northern hemisphere,
situated in the same manner as New Zealand, so that it can be used as a

standard of comparison ; but the Mediterranean sea embraces similar parallels
of latitude and it is known to nourish at least 230 species of acanthopterygii

alone. The fish which frequent the shores of New Zealand are probably as
numerous as those which visit the coasts of Italy and Sicily, and we may ex-

pect to find among them a greater variety of the wandering oceanic kinds.

Lesson, in the zoological part of the account of the voyage of the Coquille,

gives an eloquent sketch of the general distribution of fish in the Southern

seas, which may be consulted with advantage ; but much information is still re-
quired to complete this department of zoology. Seamen are so well acquainted

with the general forms of the pelagic fish, that they have ceased to regard

them as objects of curiosity, or to record their appearance ; and we conse-

quently lack observations on the precise ranges of the species. It is of the
more local kinds, owing to their peculiar habits and strange shapes, that navi-

gators on visiting a foreign coast form the bulk of their collections. Of these,
some are strictly littoral in their haunts, and prey on the minute Crustacea
which deposit their spawn in such localities ; others browse on sea-weed or on

coral, and are not likely to traverse large districts of the ocean destitute of
such productions. The boleophthahni and some other Gobioides even ascend
the beach, and like little lizards chase their insect prey through rocky crevices.
The plectognathi seem to be peculiarly adapted for living in the surf of coasts
exposed to all the fury of the ocean, and particularly among the coral barriers
of the intertropical isles. Their powers of natation are small, aided though the
caudal be by the approximation to it of the other two vertical fins, and they are
apparently tossed about at the mercy of the waves. Some of them are protected
by hard elastic cuirasses, strengthened by strong spines placed at the angles
others have their soft integuments studded by projecting flexible spines like
those of the terrestrial hedge-hog or sea echinus ; and they possess moreover
the power of rendering themselves more buoyant by inflating the skin with
air, or of steadying themselves by taking in water as ballast. Australian spe-
 cimens of these fish abound in every museum.

    The predominance of marsupial quadrupeds over the other Mammalia in
 Australia is the distinguishing feature of its zoology, and it would form a
 curious subject of inquiry, to ascertain whether there be anything analogous
 in the other divisions of the animal kingdom existing in that quarter of the
 world. Mr. Owen has shown that the marsupial structure is peculiarly

 adapted to the necessities of animals that are required to traverse large tracts

 of poor and barren country in search of food. Now an inhabitant of the

 waters must be in a condition somewhat similar to the kangaroos in the wastes

 of New Holland, when the element in which it is primarily organized to move

 and from which it draws its subsistence is occasionally deficient. Immedi-
 ately without the tropics there is a zone of various width but nowhere passing

from Pitis and Lower California across the new world to the Atlantic. In

the old world it includes the Sahara and lesser deserts of Northern Africa,

Egypt, Arabia Deserta, and certain districts in Asia, being interrupted chiefly

by the intrusion of lofty mountain chains. This arid belt is bounded by

zones of periodic rains, which on the north side of it fall in the winter season,

and on the south side in the summer only, the rains having a more uniform

character in the latter district. Similar zones exist in the southern hemi-

Cape the rivers are for the most part mere chains of ponds. Some provision

must be made for the preservation of fish inhabiting the ponds in such coun-

tries, in the dry season ; and we observe, accordingly, that in Australia vari-

ous Cheironectes, Batrachi, Gobioides, Megalapes and Apocles bury themselves

in the mud as the water dries up, and like the lepidosiren of the Gambia re-

main in an inert state until the rain falls. In South America some siluroids,

such as the Callichthys, also bury themselves in the mud, while the Doras

hancochi when the water fails marches overland in dense bodies in quest of

another river. The Anabasidece have a peculiarity in the structure of the

pharynx enabling them to retain a supply of water in seasons of drought, which

has been compared by some authors to the water-bag of the camel, that

ship of the desert. These fish are most abundant in the southern parts of

Asia, a few range to the Indian archipelago, and the genus Spirobrcmchus

peoples the rivers of the Cape of Good Hope. The Indian Anabas, a member

of the family, is said to ascend palm-trees in quest of little pools of water to

be found in the axils of the leaves. None of the group have as yet been de-

tected in Australia, though the nature of the country would lead us to ex-

pect to find them there : but the rivers have been scarcely explored by the

ichthyologist. As to New Zealand, its maritime, and consequently more humid

climate, seems to render any peculiarity in the structure of the respiratory

apparatus of its fresh-water fish less necessary. With regard to the marine

fish the proportion of known species is as I have already said too small to en-
able us to draw any very precise conclusions ; but we cannot fail in reckoning

the known Australian fish (including those of New Zealand) to be struck with

the unusual number which are furnished with simple pectoral rays, more or

less divided from the rest of the fin. The cottoid family, in which this struc-

ture is predominant, is as numerous, if not more so, in the Australian seas, as

in the corresponding latitudes of the northern hemisphere, and there are in
addition many Polynemi, Ckeironemi, Aplodactyli, Cheihdactyli, Nemadac-

tyli, and Latres, all furnished with simple pectoral rays. Many Australian

genera exist also in the seas of China. Of the Cyprinoids which are so

very abundant in India, but one species is known to exist in Polynesia or

Australia.

   In the following list " Solander" refers to that naturalist's manuscript ' Pisces

Australia^,' containing his descriptions of the New Zealand fish obtained on

Cook's first vuyage. The term " Australia" as used by him relates solely to

New Zealand, which was supposed until Cook circumnavigated it, to be part of

a great southern continent. The figures of fish executed in the same voyage
are quoted under the name of the artist " Parkinson". " G. Forster" indicates

the drawings made on the second voyage, which are preserved with those of
Parkinson, and Solander's manuscripts in the Banksian library. " J. R. Forster "

refers to the description of the species in Schneider's edition of Bloch. Forster's

manuscripts are kept at Berlin, and are said to be at present in the course of
publication in an entire state. The ' Histoire des Poissons' is quoted under
the initials of its authors, and reference is occasionally made to the 9th vo-

lume of the Annals of Natural History, in which I am now publishing " Con-

tributions to Australian Ichthyology."

1. Serranus lepidopterus (Rich. Annals, 9, p. 18.). The Butterfly-bar-
   ber-fish. {Perca lepidoptera J. R. Forster MS. II. 58. apud Schn. Epi-

    nephelus lepidopterus, Bl. Schn. p. 302.)

    This fish was discovered on Cook's second voyage, and has recently been
detected by Dr. Lhotsky on the shores of Van Diemen's Land. It belongs
to the group of Serrani, which is named " Les Barbiers" in the * Histoire des
Poissons,' and which is nearly equivalent to Bloch's genus Anthias. The
works above quoted contain all that has been published respecting it.

2. Polyprion cernuum &(C. V. 3. p. 24. t. 42.), Wreck-fish, Cherny or

    Jew-fish. (Sciama gadoides, Solander, p. 38. Parkinson, 2.t.74. Perca
    prognathus, et "Palo-tera," G. Forster, 2.t.l8. J. R. Forster, MS.iv.19.
     Epinephelus oxygeneios, Bl. Schn. p. 301 .)

    Few of the finny tribes have a wider range than this curious fish, which is
 remarkable among the percoids for its considerable size, and the peculiar ar-

 mature of its head. It is abundant in the Mediterranean, where the fisher-
 men have long applied to it an epithet expressive of its worthlessness and con-
 sequent rejection as an article of food ; and it has been taken on both sides
 of the Atlantic, from the coast of Cornwall to the Cape of Good Hope. Yet
 it seems to have been quite overlooked by European ichthyologists until the
 publication of M. Valenciennes' paper upon it in the eleventh volume of the
 · Memoires du Museum,' unless Duhamel intended to represent it in his

 &< Peches,' pi. 6. (vide C. V. 3., p. 23.). In the same year however as the pub-
 lication of Duhamel's work, this fish was an object of interest to Solander, who
 was then with Cook, navigating the seas of New Zealand. His 'Pisces

  Australia?' contain an extended description of a specimen taken off Motuaro,
  which embraces most of the peculiar characters of the genus. Parkinson's figure
  was executed at the same place, and most probably is a portrait of the same

 individual. On Cook's second voyage the species was seen by the Forsters

 at Queen Charlotte's Islands, near the 19th parallel of south latitude and 138th
 meridian, where it was known to the natives by the name of " Palo-tera". G.
  Forster's drawing of it is preserved in the Banksian library, and J. R. Forster's
 description may be found in Schneider's edition of Bloch.

 3. Centropristes trutta (C. & V. 2. p. 54.). (Scicena trutta, G. Forster, 2.

               t. 210. Perca trutta, J. R. Forster, apud Bl. Schn. p. 542.)

     This fish was procured by the Forsters in one of the coves of Queen Char-
  lotte's Sound, and Schneider quoting from the manuscripts of J. R. Forster,
  informs us that it was named by the natives " Kahavai," and by the sailors
  " Salmon-peel," on account of its rich and delicate flavour. Cuvier adopted
  the species in the second volume of the ' Histoire des Poissons,' under the de-
  signation that it has in Schneider's edition of Bloch ; but in the third volume
  of the ' Histoire des Poissons ' he supposes that the species may prove to be
  the same with the Centropristes ? truttaceus procured by Messieurs Quoy and
  Gaimard at Port Western. Several very closely resembling but distinct

  species appear to exist in the Australian seas. Two of them are named be-
  low, and Polack in his popular list of New Zealand fish mentions " Kahawai"
--16 REPORT 1842.

or colourless Salmon, but gives us no clue by which to discover the species
to which he alludes.

4. Centropristes mulloides. (Sciana mulloides, Parkinson, 2. t. 68. Sci-
                    <E?ia mulloides, ft. (sapidissima), G. Forster, 2. t. 211.

   This species was obtained by Parkinson at Hetrawai, and by the Forsters
in Queen Charlotte's Sound.

5. Centropristes sapidissimus. (Mulloides sapidissimus, Solander, p. 22.

                                                  Parkinson, 2.t.67.)

Solander has given a pretty full description of this species in his ' Pisces

Australia,' and mentions that it inhabits Tegadoo bay, and Tolaga, between

the 38th and 39th parallels of latitude. Parkinson procured the specimen

which he has figured at Opooragi. The drawings of these three, variously

named Centropristes, being unfinished, we are not in a condition to point out

their distinctive characters, neither is it quite certain that they are all speci-

Newfically different from the  Holland Centropristes truttaceus (C. and V.),

C. georgianus* (C. and V.), and C. salar (Zool. Trans. 3. p. 78.). Some ob-

servations on their peculiarities may be found in the paper last quoted.

6. Aplodactylus meandratus (Rich. Zool. Trans. 3. p. 83.). (Scicena

            meandrata, Parkinson, 2. t. 65. Mceandrites, Solander, p. 2.)

It was not until the year 1831 that the genus Aplodactylus was made

known by Cuvier, on M. d'Orbigny bringing specimens of punctatus from

AValparaiso.       second species, the arctidens, from Van Diemen's Land, is

described in the third volume of the Zoological Transactions, now in the
course of publication ; and a third, not yet named, exists in the Museum of

Fort Pitt. But as long ago as October 1769 Solander was in possession

of a New Zealand species, which was taken off Cape Kidnappers, otherwise

named Matamawi, in the forty-second parallel, and Parkinson made a draw-

ing of it. This figure in conjunction with the extended description contained

in the ' Pisces Australia? ' leaves us no reason for doubting the genus of the

fish.

7. Percis colias (C. and V. 3. p. 273.). Coaly Percis. (Labrus macrocephalus,

   Solander, p. 27. Parkinson, 2. t. 57., Gadus colias, and New Zealand Cole-
   fish, G. Forster, 2.t. 181. J. R. Forster, MS. II. 36. apud Schn. Enche-

    liopiis colias, Bl. Schn. p. 54.)

   This fish was discovered on Cook's first voyage off Owhooragi, and was

named " Cole-fish" by the seamen. Parkinson's figure was done from a spe-
cimen which was taken at Motuaro. The Forsters afterwards found it on the
same coast, and ascertained its native name to be " nera-warre." The painters
and describers of this fish differ in the numbers of the fin rays, and we may

conclude either that the species is variable or that two species have been con-

founded.                       Solander, Pise. Austr.

                                              17. J. R. Forster, apud Schn.

The two drawings however are very like one another, and there is no other
marked discrepancy in the descriptions than the variation of the numbers of

the rays.

8. Percis nicthemera (C. and V. 3. p. 274.).

Messieurs Lesson and Garnot brought this fish from the Bay of Islands, and

Cuvier says that he should be inclined to consider it as the same with J. R.
Forster's Gadus colias, but for its very different numbers of rays, which are
the same as in Parkinson's figure of macrocephalus, above quoted. It is pos-
sible that there may be a mistake or misquotation of the dorsal rays by
Schneider, in which case the nicthemera would most probably have to be
razed from our list of species. Solander mentions that the opercular bones
of macrocephalus are the only scaly parts of the head, and this character is

Heconsidered in the ' Histoire des Poissons' as a peculiarity of nicthemera.

also states that six or seven brown bands are faintly visible on the body of the
living fish, the colours in other respects being those ascribed to nicthemera.
The banded distribution of the darker tints is a prevailing one in the genus.

    In the last -quoted paper reasons are assigned for considering the several
names here quoted as synonyms of a single species, examples of which Avere
procured at Tolaga bay on Cook's first voyage, in Queen Charlotte's Sound on

his second voyage, and in the Bay of Islands by the naturalists of La Coquille.
Lesson states that 'Kouripooa,' is the name given to it by the natives of New

Zealand, while Forster says that they call it ' Bedee'.

10. Upeneus vlamingii (C. and V. 3. p. 452.). (Labrus calophthalmus, So-
     lander, p. 35. Parkinson, 2. t. 46. Up. vlamingii, Annals, 9. p. 21 1.)

   This fish came under the observation of Solander and Parkinson in Queen
Charlotte's Sound. It exists likewise in the Indian ocean, Admiral Vlaming
having left a figure of it which was copied by Renard. Specimens were also
collected by Messrs. Quoy and Gaimard.

11. Upeneus porosus (C. and V. 3. p. 455.).

   This Upeneus was detected by Peron in Van Diemen's Land, and by Les-
son and Garnot in the rivers of New Zealand.

   Parkinson and Solander saw this gurnard in Tolaga bay, at Opooragee,

and on other parts of the coast of New Zealand. INT. Lesson, and at a later

period Mr. Darwin procured specimens of it in the Bay of Islands. Solander
describes the colours of the recent fish more fully than any succeeding writer.

13. Scorp^na cardinalis (Solander, p. 28.); Parkinson, 2. 1. 12. Annals,

   The ' Pisces Australia? ' contain a long description of this species. The
habitat there assigned to it is Motuaro, but on Parkinson's drawing the more

general one of Eaheenomauwee, or the northern island of New Zealand, is
given. Much of Solander's description is quoted in the Annals of Natural

History.

14. Scorpjena cottoides (Forster apud Schneider.). (Scorpcetia cottoides,
            G. Forster, 2. 1. 190. Synanceia papillosa, Bl. Schn. p. 196.)

   Forster's figure has a strong resemblance tot\\c. Scorpama ergastulortim of Van
Diemen's Land (Annals, ix.), but wants the black mark on the first dorsal
fin. Cuvier compares it with the cirrhosa and venosa of the ' Histoire des
Poissons.' Its New Zealand name is " enooheetara."

15. Scorp^na plebeia (Solander, p. 21.). (Rich. Annals, ix. p. 214.)
   Little is known of this species. Solander, who found it in Tolaga bay, de-

scribed its colours merely, and there is no figure of it extant. It remains

therefore for the local investigator of the Zoology of New Zealand, to com-

pare it with the established species.

16. ScoRPiENA cruenta (Solander, p. 5. Annals, ix. p. 217.).

   Neither have we any figure of this fish. It was procured off Cape Kid-
nappers, and has the black mark on the dorsal fin which is so conspicuous in
the European scrofa and ergastulorum of Van Diemen's Land.

17. Sebastes percoides. (Scorpana percoides, Solander, p. 4. Parkinson, 2.

                                                   1. 16. Annals, ix.)

This fish was obtained at Motuaro in Queen Charlotte's Sound on Cook's

first voyage. Parkinson's unfinished drawing does not express the generic

characters with precision, and Solander's description is confined to the tints of

colour exhibited by the recent fish.

the second in Dusky Bay. Quoy and Gaimard found it in King George's

   In the ' Histoire des Poissons ' this species is confounded with the prece-
ding one, but it seems to be sufficiently distinct and to be characterized not
only by a more conspicuous black mark above the shoulder, but also by a

different number of rays, thus

ing proportionally longer than that of carponemus. Specimens were pro-

cured on Cook's first and second voyages off Cape Kidnappers, in Queen Char-

                                 monea, Rich. Zool. Trans. 3. p. 114.)

   The ' Pisces Australia? ' contains no account of this fish, which was procured
in Totaeranue Cove, Queen Charlotte's Sound, and Parkinson's figure is not
complete enough to render the genus perfectly certain, though the general

aspect is that of Latris.

21. Latris lineata. Yellow-tail. (Scicena lineata, G. Forster, 2. t. 204 ;
   J. R. Forster, MS. ii. 52. apud Schneider; Cichla lineata, Bl. Schn. p. 342;

    Latris lineata, Rich. Zool. Trans. 3. p. 108.)

   This inhabitant of the rocky narrows of Dusky Bay was discovered on
Cook's second voyage, and immediately named by the sailors " Yellow-tail."
It is very like the " Trumpeter" of Van Diemen'sLand (Latris hccateia), and
may possibly prove on examination to be the same, but the specimens of the
Trumpeter which have been transmitted to this country do not show any yellow

tints on the tail.

22. Latris ciliaris (Rich. Zool. Trans. 3. p. 115). (Scicena ciliaris, G. Fors-
   ter, 2. t.205. and 2. t. 209. ; J. R. Forster, MS. 2. 55. apud Bl. Schn. p. 31 1 ).

   Two sketches of this fish were made on Cook's second voyage, one (205)

in Dusky Bay, where it bears the native appellation of " moghee "; the other

(209) in Queen Charlotte's Sound. Two ciliated tubercles placed above the

eyes are peculiar to this species.

   The characters of the genus Latris are detailed in the third volume of the
Zoological Transactions, and a full description with an accurate figure is
there given of the Trumpeter ; Parkinson's and Forster's figures of the three
.New Zealand species have much of the general character of the genus, but

do not clearly show the simplicity of the lower pectoral rays*.

   The Sciasnoid fish known to frequent the coasts of New Holland are Ele-

ginusbursinus (C. and V.); Scolopsis longulus (Annals, ix. p. 389) ; Cheilo-
dactylus carponemus (Zool. Tr. 3.); Latris hecateia (Zool. Tr.); Nemadactijlus

rubro-cinctus (Annals, ix. p. 391) ; Pristipoma sexlineatum (Q. and G.).

   * And it may be proper to mention, that there is in the Museuin of the College of Surgeons
a fish, procured on one of Cook's voyages and presented to the Museum by Sir Joseph
Banks, having a very close external resemblance to Latris, but with more dorsal spines
than any species here enumerated, and the lower pectoral rays branched like the uppermost.

   Solander procured this fish between Owhooragi and Opooragi, and Forster
found it on the second voyage in Queen Charlotte's Sound. The natives of
the latter locality name it " ghoo-paree."

   Pagrus guttulatus (C. and V.) ; P. unicolor (C.and V.) ; Pentapus vitta

(C. and V.) ; P. iris (C.and V.); Lethrinus cyanoxdnthus (Icbn.Phc.~4'.f*l);
L.cinnabarhius (Id. 4. f.2);and Oblata tricuspidata (C.and V.) are Sparoid

forms which have been detected in the Australian seas.

  We have the Mamoid Gerres subfasciatus (C. and V.), and G. Jilamento-

sus (C. and V.) from the same seas, which likewise produce the following.

PLnals), Platax leschenaldi (C. and V.),  orbicularis (C. and V.), and

Scorpis georgianus (C. and V.). No Anabasidea have as yet been brought

from New Holland.

26. Scomber (scombrus) solandris. (Scomber scombrus, Solander, p. 31 ;

                                               Richardson, Annals.)

   Solander observed a mackerel in Queen Charlotte's Sound, which he thought

was the well-known European species. He neither describes nor figures it,

but merely mentions the number of its rays, and states that the ordinary size
of the fish is greater than in Europe. It is probably the Scomber loo of the

' Histoire des Poissons.'

27. Thyrsites atun, altivelis (Rich. Zool. Tr. iii. p. 119). (Scomber splen-
   dens, Solander, p. 37 ; Scomber dentex, G. Forster, ii. t. 216; Sc.dentatus,
   J. R. Forster, MS. II. 58, apud Bl. Schn. p. 24.

    Solander saw this fish in Murderer's Bay, and the Forsters found it in
Queen Charlotte's Sound, and learnt that its native name was " maga." So-
lander's description is full and characteristic, and the figure corresponds pretty
well with a specimen from Port Arthur, Van Diemen's Land, which is de-

scribed in the 'Zoological Transactions.' An actual comparison of specimens-

is required to decide whether it be the same with the Thyrsites atun of the
Cape of Good Hope, described in the 'Histoire des Poissons,' viii. p. 137,

pi. ccxix.

28. Gempylus solandris (C.and V. viii. p.216). (Scomber macrophthalmus,
    Solander, p. 40 ; Parkinson, ii. t. 91 ; Gempylus solandris, Annals, ix.)
   The account of this inhabitant of the seas washing Eaheenomauwee, in the

'Histoire des Poissons,' rests upon Solander's description and Parkinson's
figure. Some passages are quoted from Solauder in the ' Annals of Natural

History.'
          ON THE ICHTHYOLOGY OF NEW ZEALAND.                 21

   Polack mentions Sword-fish in his list of the productions of New Zealand,

but the latitude with which popular names are applied prevents us from form-

ing any decided opinion as to the genus. He may have seen the Histiopho-
rus indicus, which probably ranges southwards to New Zealand. The true
sword-fish (Xiphias gladius) is confined as far as we know to the Atlantic.
The same writer also includes "pilot-fish" in his list. He may perhaps mean

the Naucrates indicus (C. and V. viii. p. 326).

29. Chorinemus forsteri (Rich. Annals, ix.). (Scomber maculatus, G.
    Forster, ii. t. 228; J. R. Forster, MS. II. 120, apud Schn. ; Sc. forsteri,

    Bl. Schn. p. 26.

   The Forsters found this fish in New Zealand, and a New Holland specimen

is described in the 'Annals of Natural History.' It is named "milinjidnee" by
the natives of Port Essington, and is very probably the same species with the
Chorinemus commersonianus of the ' Histoire des Poissons,' viii. p. 370.

30. Trachurus Nov^e Zelandije (C. and V.ix. p. 26).

   This trachurus belongs to the group which has the lateral line armed by
fewer than eighty shields, and differs little in external appearance from the
common European Caranx trachurus, but there are peculiarities in the struc-

ture of its skeleton and viscera. It was brought from New Zealand and Am-
boyna by Quoy and Gaimard, and from Shark Bay, New Holland, by Lesson

and Garnot.

31. Trachurus ? clupeoides (Ann. ix.). (Scomber clupeoides, Solander,

                                                                 p. 31.)

   Solander obtained this species in Dusky Bay. There is no figure of it, but
his description points it out to be a Caranx, and most probably of the group

of Trachuri.

32. Caranx lutescens (Annals, ix.). (Scomber lutescens, Solander, p. 38.)
   Was procured in Queen Charlotte's Sound on the 30th of March, 1 770.

33. Caranx sinus-obscuri (Annals, ix.). (Scomber trachurus, varietas,

                             G. Forster, ii. t. 223. C. and V. ix. p. 20.)
   This Caranx, discovered by the Forsters in Dusky Bay, is, like the preceding
species, a member of the third of the three groups into which the " caranx
proprement dit " are divided in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' x. p. 45.

34. Caranx platinoides (Annals, ix.). (Scomber platinoides, Solander,

                                                                  p. 13.)

  An inhabitant of Tolaga Bay, but depending as a species on Solander's too

brief description.

35. Caranx georgianus (Jenyns, Zool. Beagle, p. 71.). (Scomber micans,

Solander, p. 27 ; Parkinson, 2. t. 89. Caranx georgianus, C. and V. ix.

p. 85 ?)

Inhabits Opooragi, New Zealand, and Shark Bay, New Holland.

Polack mentions Dories as inhabiting the seas of New Zealand, but whether

he alludes to the same species that is taken at Van Diemen's Land or not re-

mains to be ascertained.

The Australian Scomberoids are Scomber australasicus (C. and V.), Thyn-

    t. 239 ; J. R. Forster apud Bl. Schneider, p. 120.)
    Forster states that this mullet ascends the rivers of Dusky Bay in shoals in
 the month of April.
     Polack says that mullet frequent the deep banks on the eastern coast of

 New Zealand, and are named " kanai " by the natives.
    Mugilperonii (C. and V.), M. acutus ( C- and V.), M. argenteiis (Q.and G.),

                                                       GoBIOIDEjE.

    Fish of this family abound in great variety in the seas of New Zealand aud

 Australia, examples of most of the generic and sub-generic forms described
 in the ' Histoire des Poissons ' having been brought by voyagers from that
 district of the ocean. The exposed haunts, singular habits and strange forms

 of many gobioid fishes subject them to easy capture, and we find accordingly

 that they form a considerable portion of the collections of the casual visitors
 of the shores which they inhabit.

 38. Clinus littoreus (C. and V. xi. p. 389). (Blennius littoreus, G. Fors-
    ter, ii. t. 184 ; J. R. Forster, MS. II. 42, apud Schn. ; Bl. quadridactylus,

      Bl.'Schn. p. 177.)

    Named " kogop " by the inhabitants of Queen Charlotte's Sound, where

 the Forsters saw it on the 24th of October, 1774.

 39. Acanthoclinus fuscus (Jenyns, Zool. Beagle, p. 93, pi. xviii. f. 2).
    This form is peculiar to New Zealand. Mr. Darwin procured his speci-

 mens in the Bay of Islands. It is remarkable for the number of its anal spines.
 Mr. Jenyns remarks that the preceding species is probably another member
 of the genus, but this supposition is discountenanced by Forster's figure,
 which shows only nine anal rays.

 40. Cristiceps australis (C. and V. xi.p. 102).
    Pcron discovered this fish in Van Diemen's Land, and Quoy and Gaimard

 afterwards found it in the river at Hobart Town, and drew the portrait of a
 specimen which measured seven inches. Another paragraph in the ' Histoire
 des Poissons ' mentions that the last-named naturalists brought three very

small examples of the species from New Zealand.

41. Tripterygion nigripenne (C. and V. xi.p. 413).

    Lesson and Gamot, when they accompanied Duperrey, discovered this

species in the rivers of New Zealand.

42. Tripterygion varium (C. and V. xi. p. 414). (Blennius varius, G. Fors-
            ter, ii. t. 185 ; J. R. Forstcr, II. 43, apud Bl. Schn. p. 178.)

  A finished drawing was made by G. Forster of a specimen of this fish,

captured on the 9th of Nov. 1774, in Queen Charlotte's Sound. Its native
name is " ke kogop."

43. Tripterygion forsteri (C. and V. xi. p. 415). (Blennius tripinnis,
                 J. R. Forster, MS. 11.41, apud Bl. Schn. p. 174.)

   This Tripterygion is also from New Zealand, notwithstanding the following

--passage in the ' Histoire des Poissons:' " On ne nous dit pas ou il avait etg

trouve." But in Forster's ' Notes,' as quoted by Schneider, we find, under
Tripterygion fenestratum, " Habitat cum sequentibus circa insulam Novae
Zelandice, inter saxa ad ostia rivulorum aquae dulcis, locis cestu mari irrigatis."

   Now in Forster's manuscripts the species stand in the following order :

MS. II. 39. Tript. fenestratum.    MS. II. 42. Clinus littoreus.

40. ' 43. Tript. varium.

41. Tript.forsteri (B.tripinnis).  44. Scorpaena cottoides, Sfc.

   te, G. Forster, ii. t. 186 ; J. R. Forster, MS. II. 39, apud Bl. Schn. p. 173.)

   G. Forster executed a figure of this species in Dusky Bay with more than
usual care. It frequents the mouths of rivulets, and is named " he-tarooa "

by the natives.

45. Tripterygion capito (Jenyns, Zool. Beagle, p. 94, pi. xix. f. 1.).

   Mr. Darwin captured this little fish on tidal rocks in the Bay of Islands.
   Several gobies and periophthalmi have been detected on the northern shores
of New Holland, and in the islands of Torres Straits, but none exist in any
of the collections that have hitherto been made in Van Diemen's Land and

New Zealand.

46. Eleotris gobioides (C. and V. xii. p. 247). Jenyns, Zool. Beagle, p. 98.

   Discovered by Quoy and Gaimard in the fresh waters on the north-east

coast of New Zealand. Forster named another member of this family, which

he found on the island of Tanna, Blennius gobioides. It is the Salarias al-
ticus of the ' Histoire des Poissons.'

47. Eleotris radiata (C. and V. xii. p. 250).
   Found by Quoy and Gaimard in the mouth of the river Thames, in Febru-

ary 1827.

48. Eleotris basalis (Gray, Zool. Misc. p. 73.).
   Inhabits the river Thames.

49. Hemerocjetes acanthorhynchus (C. and V. xii. p. 311). (Callio-
   nymus acanthorhynchus, G. Forster, ii. 1. 175; J. R. Forster, 11.30, apud

    Schneider; Call, monopterygius, Bl. Schn. p. 41.)

   No specimen of this curious fish having been seen since the time of Cook,

our knowledge of it is entirely derived from the figure and description of the
Forsters. It was thrown up after a storm in Queen Charlotte's Sound. The
natives named it " kogo-hooee," probably from some fancied resemblance or
connexion with Eleotris nigra, which is termed " kogo " in the Polynesian

language. " Hoee-hoec " signifies poisonous or man-killer in the same tongue,
and is the appellation given to the Tetraodon hispidus at Parietea. Since
writing this passage, I have, through the kindness of Mr. Gray, seen a drawing

by Dr. Dieffenbachof a Hemeroccetes from New Zealand, which may be the same

species*. It appears to differ in some of the markings from Forster's figure,
but I have not hitherto had an opportunity of comparing them accurately.

   The following Australian Gobioids have been noticed by naturalists :
Blennius tasmanius (Zool. Tr. iii.); JBlennechis anoints (C. and V.); Salarias
meleagris (C. and V.) ; S.forsteri (C. and V.) ; S. kingii (C. and V.) ; Clinus

50. Labeus pcecilopleura (C.and V. xiii. p. 95).
   Lesson and Garnot discovered this species at New Zealand, and ascertained

its native name to be " pare-quiriquiri."

51. Julis? rubiginosus (Annals). (Sparus rubiginosus, Parkinson, ii. t.
    38 ; Solander, p. 7.)
    Solander discovered this fish off Cape Kidnappers. The species resembles

 Julis decussatus.

52. Julis notatus. (Sparus notatus, Solander, p. 16; Parkinson, ii. t. 37.)
    This fish was found in Totaeranue Cove and Tolaga Bay. It resembles

Julis decussatus still more closely than the preceding species.
    The ' Pisces Australia?' contains accounts of the colours merely of Sparus

stellatus and of a Labroides asellinus, but no drawing of them being extant, it
is impossible now to say whether they ought to be referred to the Wrasse
family or not. This point remains to be settled by the ichthyologists who
may hereafter explore the bays in question. The two following species are
nearly in the same predicament, though a description of their forms is to be
found in Schneider's edition of Bloch.

53. Julis miles. (Labrus coccineus, J. R. Forster apud Schneider ; Labrus

                                            miles, Bl. Schneider, p. 264.)

    Forster's notes, as quoted by Schneider, inform us that this fish resembles
 Labrus lutiaris of Linneus, meaning most probably thereby the Julis blochii
which Cuvier distinguishes from the true Julis lu?iaris. All three have lunate

caudal fins. The New Zealand fish was captured with the hook by the sea-
men, who named it the " soldier " on account of its red jacket.

54. Julis celidotus. (Labrus celidotus, J. R. Forster apud Schn. ; Bl.
                                                    Schneider, p. 265.)

    Taken at the same place with the preceding fish.
    The Sparus prasioplifhalmusot Solander (p. 5) has six obscure bands, while
celidotus has only three, and also a large black lateral mark over the anus not
 noticed as existing in prasiophthahnus. There being no description of the form

    * Since the report was read I have had an opportunity, by the kindness of Mr. Owen, of
examinmg a specimen of this rare fish, which was presented by Dr. Dieffenbach to the Col-
lege of Surgeons. Forster's description has been misunderstood in some material parts. The

species will be described in the appendix to Dr. Dieffenbach's account of New Zealand, which
is uow preparing for the press.
                                                                        ;;

of the latter given, the genus of the fish must remain for the present uncer-
tain, since in Solander's time the genus Sparus was made to include very-

various forms.

55. Odax pullus (C. and V. xiv. p. 304). (Scarus pullus, G. Forster, ii.
           t. 202 ; J. R. Forster, MS. IV. 17, apud Schneider, p. 208.)

   Inhabiting Queen Charlotte's Sound, and known there by the name of

" niarraree."

56. Odax? vittatus (Annals, ix.). (Coregonoides vittatus, Solander, p. 1

and 39 ; Callyodon coregonoides, Parkinson, ii. t. 24.)

Two entries of this fish occur in the ' Pisces Australise,' the second being

an account of the differences between the old and young. It was taken at

Mataruhow.

The following Labroids have been taken in the Australian seas. Labrus

tetricus (Zool. Tr.) ; L.fucicola (Zool. Tr.) ; L. psittaculus (Zool. Tr.) ; L.

Icon. Pise. 3. f. 1); Odax pullus (C. and V.); Odax algensis (Zool. Tr.)

Hoplegnathus conwayi (Zool. Tr.).

Of the extensive family of Siluroidece, of which nearly 300 species are de-

scribed in the ' Histoire des Poissons,' not a single individual has been bi-ought

from New Zealand. Nor was it to be expected that many species should have

been found there, since most of the family are inhabitants of fresh water and

of the lower latitudes. In North America one species only is known to reach

the 55th parallel, and the only European species is partially diffused over

similar latitudes. The plotosus ikapor or lineatus (C.and V. xv. p. 412), a

widely spread inhabitant of the Indian and Polynesian oceans, descends to

the west coast of New Holland, and is the most southerly Siluroid which is

known to us.

  We have no Cyprinoid fish to enumerate among the productions of the

fresh waters of New Zealand, though it is highly probable that some will here-

after be brought from thence. The Leuciscus (Ptycholepis) salmoneus, which

is the Mugil salmoneus discovered by Forster at the island of Tanna, exists at

APort Essington, New Holland.      specimen brought from thence by Mr.

Gilbert has enabled me to ascertain that this fish is not an Elops, as Cuvier

has said in his ' Regne Animal ' (ii. p. 324). Solander notices briefly, in his
' Pisces Australia?,' a Mugil lavaretoides, which is also referred to Elops in

the ' Histoire des Poissons ;' but the little that Solander says of the fish ap-

plies entirely to Mr. Gilbert's specimen of salmoneus, though his account is not

particular enough to establish their specific identity ; we may therefore quote
Solander's New Zealand fish, with some doubt, as

57. Leuciscus ? lavaretoides. (Mugil lavaretoides, Solander, p. 15.)

                                                              Esocnxffi.

   Taken with the hook in the lakes and rivulets which flow into Dusky Bay.
The aborigines name it " he-para." Cook's sailors called it " rock-trout."
Another species, most probably the truttaceus of Cuvier, inhabits the rivers
of Van Diemen's Land, where it obtains the appellation of " the trout."

59. Galaxias fasciatus (Gray, Zool. Misc. p. 73.).
   This species was discovered by Dr. Dieffenbach in the river Thames.

26 REPORT-- 1842.

60. Mesitf.s attenuatus (Jenyns, Zool. Beagle, p. 123, pi. xxiv.f. 5).

   This fish was taken in the fresh waters of the Bay of Islands by Mr. Dar-
win. The genus Mesites seems to be very nearly allied to Galaxias, and this
species in particular to be scarcely distinguishable from a young Galaxias

fasciatus.

61. Sairis scombroides. {Esox scombroides, Solander, p. 40 ; Esox saurus,
 G. Forster, ii. t. 233 ; J. R. Forster, MS. II. 65, apud Bl. Schneider, p. 394.)

    Solander first saw this very handsome fish in lat. 39^° S., long. 204?° W.,

between New Zealand and New Holland. He describes it as having the most

intense ultramarine or " garter-blue " on the back, and a silvery hue on the

belly. Forster's description corresponds with Solander's, both agreeing in the

colours, and in mentioning a blue network on the caudal fin, in the numbers

of the dorsal and anal finlets, and in the upper jaw being only about two lines
shorter than the lower one. They may therefore be considered as identical,
or at least as very closely allied species. The specimen figured by G. Forster
was captured on the 27th March, 1773, in Dusky Bay. The aborigines named
it " he-eeya."

62. Hemiramphus marginatus (Cuv. Reg. An. ii. p. 286).

Polack includes " Flying Fish " in his enumeration of the animals of New

Zealand. The Exoccetus exiliens and volitans inhabit both oceans, and both

are mentioned by White in his ' Voyage to Botany Bay,' as existing in the

Weseas of New Holland.  have no means of judging what the species are to

which Polack alludes, unless the Esox subpellucens of Solander (' Pisces

Australia?,' p. 14) be an Exoccetus. The only particulars of form that he men-

tions are, that the upper jaw is longest ; that there is a barbel beneath, and an

appendix at the base of the pectoral. It cannot therefore be either of the

common species, but is rather allied to the bearded ones of America, and will

stand in our list as

63. ExOC&TUS? SUBPELLUCENS.

  An inhabitant of Tolaga Bay.
   None of the voyagers, whom we have consulted, mention any of the Salmon
family as peopling the waters of New Zealand. Saurus and Aulopus exist in
the sea that washes the north-west coast of New Holland. Vide Icon. Pise. f. 1
  Esox lewinii (Griff., Cuv. pi. 60) is from New Holland.

                        Clupeoideje.

64. Clupea lata (Solander, p. 17).

    Solander records the colours merely of this fish, and as there is no figure

of it, the group of Clupeoidese, to which it ought to be referred, must remain
for the present undecided. It was procured in Tolaga Bay. The Clupea se-
tipinna of Forster, discovered by him in the island of Tanna, is a Megalops

which ranges southwards to the coast of New Holland.

                        Gadoidete.

   Polack mentions Cod-fish, bearing the native name of " wapuka," as inhabit-

ing deep banks on the east coast of New Zealand. He also particularises Hake,

Haddock and Polack as being frequently taken, though it is not likely that they
correspond exactly with the European species, whose names the settlers have

appropriated to them.

65. Lota baccha (Cuv. Reg. An. ii. p. 334). ( Gadus bacchus, G. Forster, ii.
1. 180; J. R. Forster, MS. II. 34, apud Bl. Schneider, p. 53, sub Encheliopode.)

   This is probably the Haddock mentioned above, as it has a large black spot
on the upper base of the pectorals. Solander obtained it in Murderer's Bay,
ON THE ICHTHYOLOGY OP NEW ZEALAND.  27

and has recorded a pretty full account of it's colours when fresh. George

Forster's figure is coarsely executed, but in conjunction with J. R. Forster's
notes, quoted by Schneider, it renders the species easily recognisable. Its
native name, in Queen Charlotte's Sound, is " ehogoa."

70. Lota rhacina. (Gadus rkacinus, G. Forster, ii.t. 179 ; J. R. Forster,
            MS. iv. 16, apud Schn.; Phycis rkacinus, Bl. Schn. p. 56.)

    This resembles the preceding species in form, but differs in colour and in
the numbers of the fin-rays. It was also taken in Queen Charlotte's Sound,
where it bears the appellation of " ahdoroo."

71. Brosmius venustus. (Blennius venustus, Parkinson, ii.t. 5.)

   This is doubtless one of the Hakes mentioned by Polack. Parkinson's figure
was executed from a specimen obtained in Totaeranue, or Ship Cove. Solan-
der gives no account of it, unless the brief notice of his Blennius rubiginosus,
in p. 14 of the ' Pisces Australia?,' ought to be referred to this species. As
he mentions only a single dorsal, it is most likely a congeneric fish, and there
is no great discrepancy in the colours so as to point unequivocally to a distinct

species. He took it in Tolaga Bay.
  We have already seen that the "Cole-fish" of the sailors is aPercis: whether

the " Polack " of the settlers be another Percis or a true Gadoid fish we have
no means of ascertaining.

   The Lepidolepri, or Macrouri, which are considered by Cuvier to be nearly
allied to the Gadoid family, but by the Prince of Canino to form a group of
the Ganoid order, having much affinity with many fossil genera, exist in the
depths of the Australian seas, and will probably be hereafter added to the list

of New Zealand forms.

                                                Platessoideje.

   Polack says that the seas of New Zealand produce Flat-fish, which are named

"pitiki" by the natives, and are intermediate between the large flounder
and the sole.

72. Rhombus? scapha. (Pleuronectes scapha, G. Forster, ii.t. 193; J. R.
                      Forster, MS. II. 46, apud Bl. Schn. p. 163.)

rigines, and compared by Forster with the Platessa limanda. The eyes are
on the left side.

73. Rhombus plebeius, Solander, p. 12.

    Solander having noticed only the colours of this flat fish, without describing

its form or dentition, we cannot refer it to its proper genus, but it is very pro-

bably a Rhombus brought from New Zealand by Dr. Dieffenbach, which

agrees with the little that Solander says of the species. The eyes are on
the right side. It was taken in Tolaga Bay, and, like the preceding one,
measured a foot in length.

   Mr. Jenyns notices a Platessa which was found by Mr. Darwin in King

George's Sound, but does not name it. He says that it scarcely differs from

the Platessa orbignyana of Bahia described by Valenciennes in the ' Voyage
of Orbigny.' Another species from Port Arthur, Van Diemen's Land, is de-

scribed in the ' Zoological Transactions,' vol. iii.

Forster from a specimen which was taken in Queen Charlotte's Sound on the

23rd of October, 1774. Its general appearance is very similar to the Gobiesox
marmoratus of Chiloe, figured in the 'Zoology of the Beagle ' by Mr. Jenyns,
but it has a square pectoral disk with niammillated edges behind the trian-
gular one of Gobiesox. The L. pinnulatus haunts stony beaches at the mouths

of rivulets, and is named by the New Zealanders " moyeadoo."

   An inhabitant of stony beaches.

   At least two species of Echcneis exist in the Australian seas, and it is pro-
bable that the islands of New Zealand are within their range.

   This Eel was sent to me from Port Arthur, Van Diemen's Land, by Deputy

Assistant Commissary General Lempriere, and fully described in a paper read
before the Zoological Society on the 9th of March, 1841. Mr. Darwin had

previously found it in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, and it has recently

been described by Mr. Jenyns in the ' Zoology of the Beagle.'

   This fish is named "ekokh" by the inhabitants of New Zealand. Schneider,
who describes it without making the usual reference to Forster's notes, in-

forms us that it is voracious, torpid and sluggish, and lurks in stony places at
the bottom of the sea, whence it may be easily extracted by an eel-spear. It

is much prized by the natives as an article of food.

several other species. The Hippocampus foliaceus seems to range over the

entire circuit of the coasts of New Holland.

                              Plectognathi.

   The Australian seas are very rich in fish belonging to this order, and doubt-

less many of the same species frequent the coasts of New Zealand, though

only a few have hitherto been brought from thence. The Diodon nycthemerus
is abundant at Van Diemen's Land.

80. Tetraodon hamiltoni (Nob.).

   This species was brought from New Zealand by J. M. Hamilton, Esq., As-
sistant Surgeon in the Royal Navy, and the specimen is now in the Museum

of Haslar Hospital. It resembles the Tetraodon jiuviatilis of Hamilton (Fishes
of the Ganges, t. 30. f. 1). Van Diemen's Land produces another species of
the same group, which is said to have poisoned several of the settlers.
ON THE ICHTHYOLOGY OP NEW ZEALAND.                              29

   The Telraodon sceleratus, discovered byForster in New Caledonia, descends

to the west coast of Australia, where it attains a great size. It bears the re-
putation of being very poisonous. Another species is named at Otaheite
" hoee-hoee " (kills men).

81. Monacanthus scaber. (Balistes scaber, G. Forster, ii. t. 247 ; J. R.

   This is known at Queen Charlotte's Sound by the name of " baddeek."
There is nothing either in the figure or description which disagrees with a
species seen by Solander at Motuaro and off Cape Kidnappers, and entered
twice in his ' Pisces Australia?' under the names of Balistes unicornu (p. 9)
and Balistes scabrosus (p. 35).

   Solander observed this fish in Murderer's Bay on the 16th of January,
1770. His description extends merely to the colours of the recent fish. Its
aboriginal name is "erke-perkepe;" its designation by the English settlers
" elephant-fish." The species of Callorhynchus have not been rigidly com-
pared with each other, but two certainly exist, if the size of pectoral fins be
considered as a specific mark.

     Report on the Progress of the Meteorological Observations at

           Plymouth. By W. Snow Harris, F.R.S., fyc.

Since I last had the honour of presenting to the Association the results of
the discussion of the hourly meteorological observations, made and registered
at H. M. Dock-yard at Devonport, three additional years have been nearly
completed ; and I shall be in a position at the close of the present year (1842)
to revise and bring under one general view the results of the series, con-
tinued now hourly, without any material omission, since the year 1S32, and
which will hence complete for temperature ten years' observations. The vast
mass of registered observations of the different instruments which the Asso-

ciation has entrusted to my care, have not been so far discussed and brought

under an appropriate form, as to enable me, on the present occasion, to enter
fully upon them ; nor indeed is it desirable to do so before the observations
of the present year are complete and can be included with the preceding
years. The only notice, therefore, of the further progress of the meteoro-

logical register at Plymouth, which it is at present in my power to submit for

the consideration of the Section, is a general discussion of five years' results

of the barometer and of experiments on the wind made with Whewell's ane-
mometer, and which I venture to hope the Association may deem not alto-
 gether unworthy its attention.

    In the annexed table and accompanying chart (pi. iv.) will be found the
mean hourly pressure for each of the years 1837, 1838, 1839, 1840 and
 1841, together with the mean of these years deduced from 43,800 observa-
tions, at 75 feet above the level of the sea, and reduced to 32° of Fahren-
heit's scale by Schumacher's tables, from the table referring to the expan-
 sion of the mercury without reference to the scale of measure, the instrument
 employed being of the peculiar construction already noticed in the Reports
 of the Association*, and to which that table is most perfectly applicable.

    In laying down the graphical delineations given in this chart, the same
 method was resorted to as in my preceding Report three years since, viz.

                              * Reports of the British Association for 1833, p. 415.
METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AT PLYMOUTH.  31

the mean points were first marked off, and then a continuous line was passed
through them by means of a flexible batten, so as to include the greatest
number ; the points of deviation from such a continuous and fair curve being
marked by a star. Now, I have to call the attention of the Association to
the surprising coincidence in the general character of all these lines, and the
very few and small deviations which they present ; a result which I cannot
but deem somewhat remarkable, considering the frequent atmospheric dis-
turbances to which we are liable in these latitudes. The observations them-
selves must have been most carefully made, otherwise such a constant result

could not possibly have been arrived at ; and I cannot but deem it my duty

to impress on the Association, the propriety of preserving with great care the
original manuscript of the observers and printing the whole series, as being
calculated to advance the present state of meteorology. The meteorologist

will have then at his command a series of hourly records obtained at con-
siderable cost in money and time, of as unexceptionable a character as in

the nature of the circumstances under which they have been made, and the
present state of science, it is possible to obtain.

Table, containing the mean hourly pressures for each of the years 1837> 1838,
   1839, 1840 and 1S41, together with the mean of these years from 43,800

 --observations, at 75 feet above the mean level of the sea, reduced to 32° of

   Fahrenheit's scale. The periods of maxima are denoted by the sign +,

  --the minima by the sign , and the mean by a *. See pi. iv.
--32 report 1842.

10 a.m. and 10 p.m., being, with only one exception, a uniform result for
the whole series.

   The hours of minima are 4 a.m. and 4 p.m., being also a uniform result of
the five years without any exception.

   When we consider that the few deviations from a fairly continuous curva-
ture, as laid down in the graphic delineation of the mean hourly march of the
atmospheric pressure (pi. iv.), apply to the fourth place of decimals, we have
fair ground for believing that by these observations we have really arrived at

the general laws of the horary oscillation at Plymouth.

  My Report for the year 1839 contains many general deductions from these

observations ; and Professor Airy, to whom they were submitted, seemed to

think that at present little more could be effected by them. I cannot, how-
ever, but again remind the Association that 48,000 hourly observations on
pressure and 87,600 hourly observations on temperature, of a very fair and
perfect kind, made and discussed with great labour and at great cost to the
Association, should not be lost sight of, and be allowed to exist only in the
fragile form of a manuscript, but should be permanently secured and placed
at the disposal of the scientific world generally. There are members of this
Association so highly gifted with powers of physical research, that it would
be by no means unreasonable to hope that, should their attention become di-
rected to particular views of this branch of science, they would with such a
mass of accredited observation at their command, find themselves in a posi-
tion to contribute essentially to the future advance of meteorology.

  My last Report on Whewell's anemometer contained an account of the

general indications of the instrument for one year, and of the means I pro-
posed to pursue with a view of giving its indications not only a relative but
an absolute value. Although the tempestuous and unsettled weather which
marked the close of the last meeting of the Association greatly impeded the
experiments which I proposed to make, and the early period of our meeting
this year has somewhat abridged the intermediate time, I have been to a
great degree enabled to realize the view I entertained of the possibility of
deducing, by actual experiment, the absolute velocity of the aerial current
corresponding to certain indications of the instrument, so as not only to de-
termine the mean direction of the wind for a given time, but the absolute
mean rate at which it has moved.

    It does not appear requisite at present to enter into a minute detail of the

various experiments ; it may perhaps be sufficient to state that the pressure
and velocity of the wind were observed simultaneously with the anemometer,
and the results tabulated and discussed. From these results the following

deductions were arrived at.

   1. When the pencil tracing the integral effect of the wind moved by the

revolutions of the fly at the rate of 1 division of the scale of measure, or *1

of au inch per hour ; the current of air for the same time moved at a mean

rate of 11 feet per second.

   2. The space described by the pencil appeared to be proportional to the
square of the velocity of the aerial current acting on the fly. Thus when
the pencil described 4 divisions of the scale in an hour, the velocity, by a
mean of many observations, amounted to 22 feet in a second.

   When the velocity was 15 feet in a second, the pencil had described about

two divisions of the scale in an hour, and so on.
    Having then the velocity due to a given rate of indication per hour taken

as unity, it is easy to find the velocity of the wind due to any other rate of
indication, since we have only to multiply the square root of the given rate
by the constant 1 1 , the velocity per second corresponding to a space of 1 divi-
METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AT PLYMOUTH.  33

sion of the scale. I have in this way endeavoured to arrive at something like
an approximation to the velocity and direction of what I believe would
amount to a trade-wind in the place of observation. The general type of the
wind, as laid off on the principles suggested by Mr. Whewell, I have now
the pleasure of exhibiting to the Section ; and it will be seen that it furnishes
a general resultant, directed from about S.S.W. to N.N.E., being from the

southerly to the northerly points of the compass*.

   In the annexed table will be found the mean velocity of the current for
each successive month, taken without regard to direction, together with the
mean velocity for the whole year ; the period of observation being from April
1841 to April 1842.

never hope to arrive at anything like a correct view of the great annual

movement of our atmosphere.

In the preceding calculations it is to be understood that I have only been

dealing with mean results, and not with particular ones, which would of

course give velocities far surpassing anything exhibited in the preceding table.

I have now, in concluding this short notice of the progress and present

state of the meteorological observations at Plymouth, merely to suggest to

the Physical Committee of the Association, the propriety of either closing

these observations after the completion of another year, or otherwise recom-

mending the further continuance of the observations at the Dock-yard to the

consideration of Her Majesty's government : a system and method of observa-

tion having been completely organized there, the inconvenience and expense

to the naval department of the government would be too small to merit con-

Mysideration.  own view is, that the ten years' observations which will be

speedily complete, are sufficient for deducing the principal laws of tempera-

ture and pressure at this place ; but that, inasmuch as similar observations are

now being recorded through the instrumentality of the Association in various

parts of the world, it would be so far desirable to have simultaneous observa-

tions made at Plymouth. I cannot but hope that the Physical Committee

will give this matter serious consideration.

Plymouth, June 10, 1842.

Second Report of a Committee consisting of Mr. H. E. Strickland,
   Prof. Daubeny, Prof. Henslow, and Prof. Lixdley, appointed,
   to make Experiments on the Growth and Vitality of Seeds.

In order to carry out the objects of this Committee arrangements have been
made for the formation at the Botanic Garden, Oxford, of a depot of seeds to
be preserved in various ways, and to be submitted, at successive periods, to
experiment. The amount of labour required for the preservation of these
seeds, the conduct of the experiments, and the tabulating their results, has
necessitated the appointment of a curator at a small salary, whose report for
the present year is annexed.

   The expenses incident to these experiments have amounted to £9 15s. lid.
As a considerable number of jars and other materials for preserving seeds
will be required for the further prosecution of the inquiry, the Committee re-
spectfully recommend that the sum of £15 be this year granted for the pur-

pose.

   The Committee having now established a permanent place of deposit for

seeds to be submitted to experiment, they wish particularly to request the

contribution of specimens from persons who may be interested in this inquiry.

Parcels of seeds of various species, both recent and of old dates, in quantities
sufficient for a considerable number of experiments, and accompanied with
remarks specifying the yeai's in which they were collected, and the conditions
under which they have been preserved, will be highly acceptable, as will also
specimens of soils taken from excavations of various depths, and carefully pro-
tected from the access of extraneous matter, in order to ascertain the species

of plants which may spontaneously vegetate in them. All communications
on this subject to be sent to Prof. Daubeny, Botanic Garden, Oxford.

                                                                            H. E. Strickland,

ON THE GROWTH AND VITALITY OF SEEDS.                                     35

during the present year towards forming an extensive collection of seeds of

at least one species of as many genera of plants as practicable, to be sub-
jected to various modes of preservation, for the purpose of carrying on a se-

ries of experiments with the view of ascertaining the true limit of their ve-
getative durability, the curator begs to say, that he has, under the immediate

superintendence of the Committee appointed to investigate the same, since

October 1, 1841, received and collected seeds of 78 species of 60 genera,
illustrating 25 natural families of plants, which are now preserved according
to the mode decided on as that to be generally adopted ; namely, in brown-
paper parcels placed in earthen jars with one aperture, and covered with a

stratum of fine sand.

   Besides the mode just referred to as particularly determined on for general

adoption, the curator has also put up some wheat and also seeds of Lasthenia

californica, gathered in 1841, each in amass in porous earthen jars toith two
Aapertures, which are covered with fine wire-gauze.
                                                     few seeds also of some

of the same species as those preserved according to the prescribed mode are

put up in waxed cloth, by way of comparison of methods of preservation.

The subjoined is a list of seeds, of which, with few exceptions, a sufficient

quantity of each species has been obtained and already put up for experiments,
if sown according to the scheme entered in the resolutions, up to the year 1909.

   Of these seeds a portion has been purchased, and the remainder has been

received from the London Horticultural Society, the Oxford Botanic Gar-

den, and the Editor of the Gardener's Chronicle.

  A certain number of seeds of each of the species entered in this list have

this spring been sown, as directed, at the Oxford Botanic Garden, the Cam-
bridge Botanic Garden, and also at the Garden of the London Horticultural

Society at Chiswick, the result of which will be seen by reference to the

following table:

   At Oxford, with the exception only of those seeds which are usually sown
on a hotbed, the seeds here registered were sown this season (1842) on the
3rd of May, on a warm south border in the Botanic Garden.

    The table shows that the three species of seeds gathered in 1834 and sub-
jected to experiment in 1842, had entirely lost their vegetative power, as was
the case with the eight species of the growth of 1835, the eighteen species of
the growth of 1836, and also thirteen species of that of 1837, fifteen species
having been sown. The whole under these dates were preserved according
to the usual mode, viz. in stout brown paper : thus involving the necessity
of procuring, if possible, new seeds of those species, during the current sea-

son, to be subjected to future experiments for the purpose of ascertaining the

actual limit of their vegetative durability.
    Although the above-registered seeds are all that can in conformity with

the resolutions of the Committee be looked upon as constituting a portion of
the experiments to which this report has strict reference, it may still be well
to add that in the spring of 1841, having the same object in view which these
experiments it is hoped will determine, many seeds of old dates were sown on
a gentle hot-bed, principally in the Oxford Botanic Garden.

    They were,
    I. Experimented on by Professor Daubeny, taken from Professor Morison's
Herbarium at the Oxford Botanic Garden, bearing date, in many instances,
          --

of 1706. One hundred species were sown, but as it is supposed that they

had been brushed with corrosive sublimate, this experiment is not of much
Avalue, and it is therefore not necessary to enumerate the species.
                                                                     list of

them is however preserved for reference.
    II. Twenty-four species from Dr. Sibthorp's Collection at the Oxford Bo-

tanic Garden, dated about 1787, experimented on by Professor Daubeny.
These seeds having been imperfectly preserved and injured by insects are not
of much authority, and it is therefore needless to enumerate them.

   III. The following species, from a very old Herbarium in Merton College
Library, Oxford, given to the Committee by the Rev. J. Bigg, experimented

on by Professor Daubeny.                Hedera helix.
                  Atropa belladonna.

              Viburnum Opulus.          Aspidium Filix mas.

IV. One hundred seeds of Wheat, Barley, and Lentils respectively, from

Egyptian catacombs, given to the Committee by the Trustees of the British
Museum, experimented on by Professor Daubeny and H. E. Strickland, Esq.

   V. Twelve seeds of Maize, brought from Peruvian graves by Mr. Cuming,
given to the Committee by Dr. Robert Brown, experimented on by H. E.

Strickland, Esq.

   VI. Fourteen seeds of Green Melon, gathered in 181 4, given to the Com-
mittee by Dr. Lindley, experimented on by H. E. Strickland, Esq., and Pro-

fessor Daubeny.

In all these instances a purely negative result was obtained, no vegetation

taking place in any of the cases.

Report of the Committee on Railway Sections. By Charles

   Vignoles, Esq., F.R.A.S., M.R.I.A., M. Inst. C.E., Professor

   of Civil Engineering, University College, London.

A grant of 200/. from the Association was made at the Glasgow Meeting in

1840, on a joint application from the Geological and Mechanical Sections,
towards obtaining profiles of the various railways in the United Kingdom,
chiefly with a view (before the slopes of the excavations become soiled over and
covei-ed with vegetation) of putting on record the geological appearances and
strata developed by the many vast openings made through the country by the

operations of modern engineering.
    At the Meeting in 1841, a renewal of the unappropriated balance of the

first grant was made : the whole of this sum has however since been ex-
pended, and further liabilities have been incurred ; and the results are now
laid before the Sections which originated the subject, in the shape of nume-
rous plans and sections of several of the railways, and of the enlarged parts

of the profiles of the excavations only.

   The Committee appointed by the Association have great pleasure in report-
                      --

ing, that in obtaining these documentsthey have been aided in the most effective

and satisfactory manner by all the Railway Companies to whom they have

applied, and also by their several officers ; the engineers in particular having
taken extreme pains and great interest in forwarding the views of the Asso-

ciation. When so many parties have thus zealously co-operated, it might be

almost invidious to name one without specifying all ; but in particularly men-
tioning Mr. Swanwick the engineer of the North Midland Railway, the Com-
mittee wish to do so for the purpose of remarking on the great care taken
by that gentleman to mark upon the sections as his works went on, all the
geological detail shown in the excavations of that railway which passes
through so interesting a region. There has consequently been put into pos-
session of the Committee a vast extent of most valuable records of the kind
sought for, and which at the same time form a most striking example, well
worthy of imitation, of the combination of engineering and geological infor-

mation available for ceconomic purposes.

   The Committee were not at first able to organize a system of working the
grant to their entire satisfaction, but after some experience they ascertained
that, with the favorable disposition shown by all the Railway Companies, they
might (without increasing the expense) by degrees and in no great time be
able to form an interesting and valuable collection, not only of the sections of
the excavations of the railways, but of the whole of the plans and sections of
the lines, which, concentrated in a public depository and open to the inspec-
tion of all scientific and literary bodies and individuals, and to the public in
general, under proper regulations, would be of high interest. In fact such do-
cuments were almost necessarily required as the mere indices whereby to iden-
tify the particular geological profiles ; but so useful and important is such a
collection likely to become, that it is not unreasonable to hope and believe
that after another year's experience shall have matured the arrangements of
the Committee, and perfected their proposed system of record, and brought
down the expense to a certain and moderate rate per mile, the subject may be
taken up by Her Majesty's Government, and made to form part of the great
Geological Survey of the United Kingdom, conducted by Sir Henry De la
Beche in connection with the Trigonometrical Survey now carrying on by
Colonel Colby and the Officers of the Corps of Royal Engineers.

   The Committee are therefore not without hope that the Geological Section
will again apply to the General Committee for a further grant at the present
meeting to enable them to complete the organization they have begun. The
documents which the Committee have to submit are the following :

    1st. Plans and sections of the whole of the Midland Counties Railway from
Rugby to Derby and Nottingham, about 68 miles.

    Enlarged sections of the cuttings only of this railway, prepared to be filled
in geologically. The chief characteristics of this district are the gypsum

beds, commonly called plaster of Paris, and the water-setting lime, well known
to engineers as the Barrow lime.

    2nd. Plans and sections of the whole of the North Midland Railway from
Derby to Leeds, about 72 miles. The geological detail, as furnished by Mr.
Swanwick, is laid down on the working sections of the cuttings, but as it has
been considered by the Committee that a uniform system should be observed,
enlarged sections have been prepared, on which, as on the similar sections of
the other lines, the strata should be delineated. It may be observed here, that
these enlarged sections are laid down in the proportion of one inch to forty feet
upon the natural scale, that is, the vertical and horizontal scales are alike,
which is not always the case in ordinary geological sections, and very seldom

so with the working sections for earth-work and similar engineering purposes.
--40 BEPORT 1842.

   This railway intersects the coal districts for many miles, and is replete with

interesting subjects.

   3rd. Plans and sections of the Manchester and Leeds Railway from Man-
chester to Normanton, about 50 miles.

    These latter are not quite finished, but will be so before the close of the

Meeting.
    Enlarged sections of a considerable portion of the excavations only on this

railway, filled up with the geological detail.
    4th. Enlarged sections of the excavations only on the Glasgow, Paisley, and

Greenock railway, about 15 miles, with the geological detail.
    5th. Similar sections of the Manchester and Bolton Railway, about 11 miles,

containing full details of the strata where the remarkable fossil trees were
found, and of the trees also, models of which are in the Exhibition-room at the
Royal Institution in Manchester. The liberality of this Company will afford
several opportunities for the members of the Association to visit these trees,
and the particular profile of the excavation where they were found will remain
in the Geological Section, or in the Royal Institution, with the models.

   6th. Similar enlarged sections of the cuttings only on the Hull and Selby
Railway, about 20 miles, with the geological detail.

   The whole of these enlarged geological sections were furnished by Mr.
Wright ; and others are stated to be preparing for the Committee, but they
have not yet come to hand.

    These records, according to the directions of the Association, will be depo-

sited in the Museum of CEconomic Geology in London, where they may at all

times hereafter be usefully referred to.
   In conclusion the Committee cannot refrain from observing, that the docu-

ments thus collected are equally important and interesting to the philosopher,

to the geologist, and to the engineer. To the theoretical investigator they

present the curious and varying features of the crust of this portion of the globe ;
to the practical engineer they offer a memorial of the experience of the pro-

fession, whence many a serviceable lesson for future operations may be learned,
whereby difficulties and expense may be hereafter avoided and diminished,
and from which valuable information may be derived for the appliance of

materials in constructions (it being one of the greatest arts of the engineer
to avail himself of the most immediate natural resources which he has to dis-

place in one instance, and to apply them usefully in another, when in juxta-
position). On the other hand, the minute variations of the strata and soil,
thus accurately delineated, and referred to well-defined altitudes above the
general level of the sea, become of the very highest interest to the geolo-
gist, and no less so to the mining engineer; more especially on the lines
of railway intersecting the coal and mineral districts, where in so many in-
stances labour, directed by science and sustained by commercial enterprise,
has laid bare in deep chasms the secrets of nature, and the stores whence
this country has derived so many advantages ; and drawn from our mines
of coal and rude metallic ores, that abundant wealth and prosperity which
the more splendid productions of Potosi and of Mexico have failed to bestow

on their possessors.

only propose to state the results, and terminate the series of experiments com-
menced by the former Committee appointed at the Liverpool Meeting in 1837,
as we consider them to have been now continued for a sufficient time to sup-
ply us with very considerable negative evidence upon the preserving powers
of the different materials taken separately. Upon receiving notice of our ap-
pointment, we determined that as no report upon these experiments had been
printed by the Association, it would be advisable to defer the commencement
of any new ones until after we had had an opportunity of giving a short state-
ment concerning those already in progress, but hope in the autumn of the pre-
sent year to commence a new series, in which it is proposed that vegetable
substances should occupy a more prominent place.

   The experiments to which this report refers were commenced in June 1838,
having thus continued for four years, and were made by placing in small glass
jars (5 inches by 2) solutions in water of the different substances unmixed,

but tried in three proportions, namely, (1) a saturated solution, (2) a solution
diluted with an equal quantity of water, and (3) with a double quantity. The
following are lists of them, arranged according to their value as preservatives

of animal substances.

                                     1. Good Preservatives.

              Subcarbonate of potash.
            Naphtha employed in the proportion of 1 part to 7 of water.

2. Moderately good, but the specimens rather too soft.

Sulphate of magnesia.  Arseniate of potash.

3. Moderately good when examined in 1840, but the specimens now decom-

                                                                  posed.

Alum.                  Sulphate of zinc.
Muriate of ammonia.    Bicarbonate of potash.
Muriate of magnesia.   Arsenious acid.

Nitre.

4. Quite useless for the purpose of Preservation.

Sulphate of iron.      Nitrate of soda.
Sulphate of copper.    Muriate of barytes.
Sulphate of soda.      Muriate of lime.
Sulphate of potash.    Phosphate of soda.
Carbonate of ammonia.  Chloride of potash.
Nitrate of barites.    Oxalic acid.
Nitrate of ammonia.
                       Rough pyroligneous acid.

Nitrate of strontian.

  A few drops of kreosote in water is a good preservative, but stains the

specimens brown.
    Corrosive sublimate preserves perfectly, but hardens the substances too

much.

   Concentrated acetic acid decomposes the skin, bones, and cellular mem-

brane, but leaves the muscles untouched.
   The vegetable specimens are well preserved in oxalic acid, concentrated

acetic acid, naphtha and kreosote ; moderately well in muriate of ammonia,
nitrate of ammonia, and corrosive sublimate : none of the others appear to have
succeeded, nor indeed is the colour of the vegetables well preserved in any case,

and. on the whole the experiments with them are far from satisfactory.

Abstract of Professor Liebig's Report on " Organic Chemistry ap-

  plied to Physiology and Pathology. By Lyon Playfair, M.D.

The first part of Professor Liebig's Report consists in the examination of

the processes employed in the nutrition and reproduction of various parts of

the animal ceconomy.

In vegetables, as well as in animals, we recognise the existence of a force

in a state of rest. It is the primary cause of growth or increase in mass of

the body in which it resides. By the action of external influences, such

as the presence of air and moisture, its condition of static equilibrium is dis-

turbed ; and entering into a state of motion or activity, it occupies itself
in the production of forms, which, though occasionally bounded by right

lines, are yet widely distinct from geometrical forms. This force has re-

ceived the appellation of vitalforce, or vitality.

Vitality, though residing equally in the animal and vegetable kingdoms,

produces its effects by widely different instruments. Plants subsist entirely

upon matter belonging to inorganic nature. Atmospheric air, the source

whence they derive their nutriment, is ranked with minerals by the most

distinguished mineralogists. All substances, before they can form food for

plants, must be resolved into inorganic matter.

But animals, on the other hand, require highly organised atoms for nutri-

ment ; they can only subsist upon parts of an organism. They possess within
themselves a vegetative life, as plants do, by means of which they increase

in size, without consciousness on their part ; but they are distinguished from

--vegetables by their faculties of locomotion and sensation faculties acting

through a nervous apparatus. The true vegetative life of animals is in no

way dependent upon this apparatus ; for it proceeds where the nerves of vo-

luntary motion and sensation are destroyed, and the most energetic volition

is incapable of exerting any influence on the contractions of the heart, on the

motion of the intestines, or on the processes of secretion.

All parts of the animal body are produced from the fluid circulating within

Aits organism, by virtue of vitality, which resides in every organ.  destruc-

tion of the animal body is constantly proceeding ; every motion, every mani-

festation of force, is the result of the transformation of the structure, or of its

substance ; every conception, every mental affection, is followed by changes
in the chemical nature of the secreted fluids ; every thought, every sensation,

is accompanied by a change in the composition of the substance of the brain.
   It is to supply the waste thus produced, that food is necessary. Food is

either applied in the increase of the mass of a structure (i. e. in nutrition), or

it is applied in the replacement of a structure wasted (i. e. in reproduction).

   The primary condition for the existence of life is the reception and assimi-

--lation of food. But there is another condition equally important the con-

tinual absorption of oxygen from the atmosphere.

All vital activity results from the mutual action of the oxygen of the at-

mosphere and the elements of the food. All changes in matter proceeding

in the body are essentially chemical, although they are not unfrequently in-

creased or diminished in intensity by the vital force. The influence of poi-

sons and remedial agents on the animal ceconomy, proves that the chemical

combinations and decompositions proceeding therein, and which manifest

themselves in the phaenomena of vitality, may be influenced by bodies pos-

sessing a well-defined chemical action. Vitality is the ruling agent by which

the chemical powers are made to subserve its purposes, but the acting forces

are chemical. It is from this view, and from no other, that we ought to view

vitality. Wonders surround us on all sides : the formation of a crystal is not
             ON ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.                         43

less incomprehensible than that of a leaf or of a muscle ; the production of

vermilion, from the union of sulphur and mercury, is as much an enigma as

the production of an eye from the substance of the blood.

According to Lavoisier, an adult mail takes into his system every year

827 lbs. of oxygen, and yet he does not increase in weight. What then be-

comes of the enormous quantity of oxygen introduced in the course of a year

into the human system ? The carbon and hydrogen of certain parts of the

body have entered into combination with the oxygen introduced through the

lungs and through the skin, and have been given out in the form of carbonic

acid and the vapour of water. At every moment, with every expiration,

parts of the body are thus removed, and are emitted into the atmosphere.

   No part of the oxygen inspired is again expired as such. Now it is found

that an adult inspires 32^ ounces of oxygen daily ; this will convert the car-

bon of 24 lbs. of blood into carbonic acid. He must therefore take as much
nutriment as will supply the daily loss. And in fact it is found that he does

so ; for the average amount of carbon in the daily food of an adult man,

taking moderate exercise, is 14 ounces, which require 37 ounces of oxygen

for their conversion into carbonic acid.

But it is obvious, as the inspired oxygen can be removed only by its con-

version into carbonic acid and water, that the amount of food necessary for

the support of the animal body must be in direct ratio to the quantity of

oxygen taken into the system. Thus a child, in whom the organs of respira-

tion are naturally in a state of great activity, requires food more frequently,

and in greater proportion to its bulk, than an adult, and is also less patient

Aof hunger.  bird deprived of food dies on the third day ; whilst a serpent,

which inspires a mere trace of oxygen, can live without food for three months.

The number of respirations is less in a state of rest than in exercise, and the

amount of food necessary in both conditions must vary also.

   An excess of food is incompatible with a deficiency in respired oxygen,

that is, with deficient exercise just as violent exercise (which implies an in-
                                                                                                                                    ;

creased supply of food) is incompatible with weak digestive organs.

   The capacity of the chest in an animal is a constant quantity ; we there-
fore inspire the same volume of air, either at the pole or at the equator, But

the weight of the air, and consequently of the oxygen, varies with the tem-

perature. Thus an adult man takes into the system daily 46,000 cubic inches

of oxygen, which, if the temperature be 77°, weigh 32-| oz. ; but when the

temperature sinks down to the freezing point (32°), it will weigh 35 oz. Thus

an adult in our climate in winter may inhale 35 oz. of oxygen ; in Sicily he

would inspire only 28^ oz. ; and if in Sweden, 36 oz. It is obvious also, that

in an equal number of respirations we consume more oxygen at the level of

the sea than on a mountain. The quantity of oxygen inspired, and carbonic
acid expired, must therefore vary with the height of the barometer. Hence
we expire more carbon in cold weather when the barometer is high, than we

do in warm weather ; and we must consume more or less carbon in our food
in the same proportion. In our own climate, the difference between summer
and winter in the carbon expired and therefore necessary for food, is as much

as f

   Even when we consume equal weights of food, an infinitely wise Creator

has so adjusted it as to meet the exigencies of climate. Thus the fruit, on
which the inhabitants of the south delight to feed, contains only 12 per cent,

of carbon; whilst the bacon and train-oil enjoyed by the inhabitants of the

arctic regions, contain from 66 to 80 per cent, of the same element.

   Now the mutual action between the elements of food and the oxygen of

the air is the source of animal heat.
--44 REPORT 1842.

    All living creatures whose existence depends on the absorption of oxygen,
possess within themselves a source of heat independent of the medium in
which they exist. This heat, in the Professor's opinion, is wholly due to the
combustion of the carbon and hydrogen contained in the food which they
consume. Animal heat exists only in those parts of the body through which
arterial blood, (and with it oxygen in solution) circulates ; hair, wool, or
feathers do not possess an elevated temperature. The carbon and hydrogen
of food, in being converted by oxygen into carbonic acid and water, must
give out as much heat as if they were burned in the open air. The only dif-
ference is, that this heat is spread over unequal spaces of time; but the actual
amount is always the same.

   As animal heat depends upon respired oxygen, it will vary according to
the activity of the respiratory apparatus of the animal. Thus the temperature

of the body of a child is 102°, whilst that of an adult is 99|°. That of birds
is higher than that of quadrupeds, or than that of fishes or amphibia, whose
proper temperature is 3° higher than the medium in which they live. All
animals, strictly speaking, are warm-blooded ; but in those only which pos-
sess lungs, is their temperature quite independent of the surrounding medium.
The temperature of the human body is the same in the torrid as in the frigid

zone. But as the body may be considered in the light of a heated vessel,
which cools with an accelerated rapidity, the colder the surrounding medium,

it is obvious that the fuel necessary to maintain its heat must vary in different
climates. Thus less food is necessary in Palermo, where the temperature of

the air is that of the human body, than in the polar regions, where it is about

90° lower.
   It has formerly been stated that the quantity of oxygen respired in the

colder regions of the earth is greater than that inhaled in the tropics ; and
by a more abundant supply of food, a greater generation of heat must ensue.

   The human body may be aptly compared to the furnace of a laboratory
destined to effect certain operations. It signifies nothing what intermediate
forms the food or fuel of the furnace may assume ; it is finally converted into
carbonic acid and water. But in order to sustain a fixed temperature in the
furnace, we must vary the quantity of fuel, according to the external tempera-

ture, that is, according to the supply of oxygen.
   In the animal body the food is the fuel, and by a proper supply of oxygen,

we obtain the heat given out during its combustion. In winter, when we
take exercise in a cold atmosphere, we respire a greater amount of oxy-
gen, which implies a more abundant supply of carbon in the food ; and by

Ataking this food, we form the most efficient protection against the cold.

starving man is soon frozen to death ; and every one knows that the animals
of prey of the arctic regions are far more voracious than those of the torrid

zone.

   Our clothing is merely an equivalent for food, and the more warmly we
are clothed, the less food we require. Were we to go destitute of clothes,
like certain savage tribes, or if in hunting or fishing we were exposed to the
same degree of cold as the Samoyedes, we could with ease consume 10 lbs.
of flesh, and perhaps a dozen tallow-candles to the bargain, as warmly-clad
travellers have related with astonishment of these people. Then could we
take the same quantity of brandy or blubber of fish without bad effects, and

learn to appreciate the delicacy of train-oil.
    We. thus perceive an explanation of the apparently anomalous habits of

different nations. The maccaroni of the Italian and the train-oil of the Green-
lander and the Russian are not adventitious freaks of taste, but necessary
articles, fitted to administer to their comfort in the climates in which they
                       :

have been born. In cold regions, the food must contain a greater quantity
of carbon, or, in other words, be more combustible.

   The Englishman in Jamaica perceives with regret the disappearance of his
appetite, which in England had been a constant recurring source of enjoy-
ment. By the use of aromatics he creates an artificial appetite, and eats as
much food as he did at home. But he thus unfits himself for the climate
in which he is placed ; for sufficient oxygen does not enter his system to
combine with the carbon contained in the food, and the heat of the climate
prevents him from taking exercise to increase the number of his respirations
the carbon of the food is therefore forced into other channels, and disease

results.

    England, on the other hand, sends her dyspeptic patients to southern cli-
mates. In our own land, their impaired digestive organs are unable to fit the
food for that state in which it best unites with the oxygen of the air, which
therefore acts on the organs of respiration themselves, thus producing pul-
monary complaints. But when they are removed to warmer climates they
absorb less oxygen and take less food, and the diseased organs of digestion
have sufficient powers to place the diminished amount of food in equilibrium

with the respired oxygen.

   Just as we would expect from these views, in our own climate hepatic dis-
eases, or diseases arising from an excess of carbon, are more prevalent in
summer ; and in winter pulmonic diseases, or those arising from an excess of

oxygen.

   The cooling of the body, by whatever means it may be produced, implies
a greater demand for food. Violent exercise, loud and long-continued speak-

ing, the crying of infants, moist air, all exert an appreciable influence on the
amount of food which is taken.

   The whole process of respiration appears most clearly developed in the
case of a man exposed to starvation.

   32|- oz. of oxygen enter into his system daily, which never again escape,
except in combination with parts of his body. Currie mentions the case of
an individual who was unable to swallow, and whose body lost 100 lbs. in
weight in one month ; and Martell, in the Transactions of the Linnean So-
ciety, recounts the case of a fat pig, overwhelmed in a slip of earth, which
lived for 160 days without food, and had diminished in weight during that
time 120 lbs. The history of the hybernating animals and of those which
acquire a periodical accumulation of fat, proves that the oxygen of the air
readily combines with the carbonaceous matters ; whilst in their winter

sleep they may be considered in the light of a lamp slowly burning, the oil
or fat for which has been stored up in sufficient quantity to sustain the com-

bustion, that is, the animal heat ; for nutrition, properly so called, does not

proceed in these animals during winter. The more fat then an animal con-
tains, the longer will it be able to exist without food, for that will be con-
sumed before the oxygen of the air acts upon the other parts of the body.

   From all this it will be seen, that in Liebig's view respiration is the fall-
ing weight, the bent spring which keeps the clock in motion; the inspirations
and expirations are the strokes of the pendulum which regulate it. In our
ordinary time-pieces we know with mathematical accuracy the effect pro-
duced on their rate of going, by changes in the length of the pendulum, or
in the external temperature. Few, however, have a clear conception of the
effect of air and temperature on the health of the human body ; and yet the
research necessary for keeping it in the normal state is not more difficult

than in the case of a clock.

   No one can deny that the nerves have considerable influence in the re-
--46 report 1842.

spiratory process, and some have even gone so far as to suppose that they

are capable of generating heat. When the pons Varolii is cut through in a

dog, or when a sudden blow is inflicted on the back of the head, the dog

continues to respire, perhaps more quickly than before, but its body cools as

rapidly as if sudden death had occurred. Exactly similar effects ensue on

the cutting of the spinal cord, or the par vagum. These experiments have

been supposed to prove that animal heat is due to nervous influence, and not

to combustion but this singular view has arisen from the erroneous con-
                                                                            ;

ception that the combustion proceeds in the blood itself. Nothing could be

more erroneous. As will afterwards be shown, the compounds which are

consumed by the oxygen of the air are produced by the viscera, and these

being paralyzed in the experiments alluded to, are unable to furnish com-

pounds for combustion, so that the heat disappears.

Others, oh the contrary, have ascribed animal heat to the contraction of

the muscles, just as heat is evolved when caoutchouc is allowed to contract

from a state of extension. Some have gone so far as to ascribe part of the

heat to the mechanical motions of the body, as if these motions could exist

without an expenditure of force consumed in producing them. Let us in-

quire in what manner this heat is produced.

  We kindle a fire under the boiler of a steam-engine and generate steam,

which steam may be applied to a machine destined for producing friction.

By this friction heat is disengaged, but it is quite impossible that the heat

Wethus obtained can ever be greater than that employed to heat the boiler.

employ a galvanic current to produce heat ; but the amount of heat obtained

is never greater than we might have by the combustion of the zinc used in

producing the current.

The contraction of muscles produces heat ; but the force necessary for the

contraction has manifested itself through the organs of motion, in which it

has been excited by chemical changes. The ultimate cause of the heat pro-

duced is therefore to be found in these chemical changes.

Professor Liebig then proceeds to prove that the heat evolved by the com-

bustion of carbon in the body is sufficient to account for all the phenomena

of animal heat. He shows that the 14 oz. of carbon which are daily con-

verted into carbonic acid in an adult, disengage no less than 1 97*477° of heat;

a quantity Avhich would convert 24 lbs. of water, at the temperature of the

body, into vapour. And if we assume that the quantity of water vaporized

through the skin and lungs amounts to 3 lbs., then we have still 146.380° of
heat to sustain the temperature of the body. And when we take into calcu-

lation the heat evolved by the hydrogen of the food, and the small specific

heat possessed by the organs generally, no doubt can be entertained that the

heat evolved in the process of combustion, to which the food is subjected in

the body, is amply sufficient to explain the constant temperature of the body.

From what has preceded, it is obvious that the amount of carbon con-

sumed in food ought to depend on the climate, density of air, and occupa-

Ation of the individual.  man will require less carbon when pursuing a

sedentary occupation, than when he is engaged in active exercise.

Professor Liebig having thus discussed the source of animal heat, proceeds

next to consider what are the ingredients in the food which may be properly

considered to be nutritious. Physiologists conceive that the various organs

in the body have originally been formed from blood ; if this be admitted, it

is obvious that those substances only can be considered as nutritious which

are susceptible of being transformed into blood.

   When blood is allowed to stand it coagulates and separates into a watery

fluid called serum, and into the clot, which consists principally of fibrin.
ON ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.  47

These two bodies contain in all seven elements, amongst which sulphur, phos-
phorus and nitrogen are found ; they contain also the earth of bones. The

serum holds in solution common salt and other salts of potash and soda, of
which the acids are carbonic, phosphoric, and sulphuric acids. Serum when

heated coagulates into a white mass called albumen. This substance, along
with fibrine, constitutes the globules of blood, along with a red colouring
matter in which iron is a constituent.

   Analysis has shown the singular result, that fibrine and albumen are per-
fectly identical in chemical composition. The arrangement of their particles
is different, as the variation in their forms proves, and their composition in
100 parts is exactly the same. They may be mutually converted into each
other. In the process of nutrition both may be converted into muscular
fibre, and that in return into blood.

    All organized parts of the body, i. e. parts possessed of a decided shape,

contain nitrogen. The principal ingredients of blood contain 1 7 per cent, of
nitrogen, and there is no part of an active organ which contains less than 17

per cent, of this element.

   The nutritive process is simplest in the case of the carnivora. This class
of animals lives on the blood and flesh of the graminivora ; but this blood
and flesh is identical with their own. The nutriment of carnivora is derived
originally from blood, and on the entrance of the nutriment into their system
it is again converted into blood. "With the exception of hair, horn, hoof and

feathers, every part of a graminivorous animal is susceptible of assimilation.

In a chemical sense, therefore, it may be considered that a carnivorous
animal in taking food feeds upon itself, for its nutriment is identical in com-
position with its own tissues.

    But at first sight the nutritive process of graminivorous animals seems al-
together different ; their digestive apparatus is less simple, and their food
contains very little nitrogen. From what constituents of vegetables is their
blood produced ?

    All vegetables contain nitrogenized compounds, and the most ordinary ex-
perience shows us, that the greater the quantity of these compounds which
 are in the food, the less is the quantity of food required for the purposes of
nutrition. The nitrogenized compounds of vegetables are called vegetable
fibrine, vegetable albumen, and vegetable casein. Vegetable fibrine is fami-
liarly known as gluten ; vegetable albumen is obtained from decoctions of
the juice of nutritious vegetables, such as cauliflowers, asparagus and man-

 gel-wurzel ; vegetable casein is principally found in leguminous seeds, such as
peas, beans, and lentils.

    These three compounds are the only nitrogenized bodies which form food
 for graminivorous animals, for all others existing in plants are rejected from

 the system.

   Now analysis has led to the interesting result that they are exactly of the

 same composition in 100 parts ; and, what is still more extraordinary, that they

--are absolutely identical with the chief constituents of the blood animal fibrine

 and animal albumen. By identity, be it remarked, we do not imply similarity,

 but absolute identity even, as far as their inorganic constituents are concerned.

   How beautifully simple, then, by the aid of these discoveries, does nutrition

 appear ! Those vegetable constituents which are used by animals to form
 blood, contain the essential ingredients of blood ready formed. In point of
 fact, then, vegetables produce in their organism the blood of all animals ; for
 the carnivora, in consuming the blood and flesh of the graminivora, consume,
 strictly speaking, the vegetable principles which have served for the nourish-

 ment of the latter. In this sense, we may say that the animal organism gives
--48 REPORT 1842.

to blood only its form ; and further, that it is incapable of forming blood out
of other compounds which do not contain the chief ingredients of that fluid.
Liebig does not, indeed, maintain that other compounds may not be trans-
formed in the body, for we know that they are ; but that they cannot form
the blood, the starting-point of the series.

   Animal and vegetable life are therefore closely connected ; for the Jirst
substance capable of affording nutriment to animals is the last product of the
creative energy of vegetables. The seemingly miraculous, in the nutritive
power of vegetables, disappears in a great degree ; for the production of the
constituents of blood cannot appear more surprising than the occurrence of
the fat of beef and mutton in cocoa beans, of human fat in olive oil, of the prin-
cipal ingredient of butter in palm oil, and of horse fat and train-oil in certain

oily seeds.

    Whilst considerations such as these have led Liebig to these conclusions
regarding the increase of mass in animals, he has still to account for the use

of the substances in food, which are destitute of nitrogen, but which we
know are absolutely necessary to animal life. Such substances are starch,
sugar, gum and pectine. In all of these substances we find a great excess
of carbon, with oxygen and hydrogen in the same proportion as in water.
They therefore add an excess of carbon to the nitrogenized constituents of
food, and they cannot possibly be employed in the production of blood, be-
cause the nitrogenized compounds contained in the food already contain exactly
the amount of carbon which is required for the production of fibrine and
albumen. Liebig enters into proofs to show that very little of the excess of

this carbon is ever expelled from the system either in the form of solid or liquid
compounds. It must therefore be expelled in the gaseous state. In short, by
a train of admirable reasoning, he arrives at the interesting conclusion, that
they are solely expended in the production of animal heat, being converted by
the oxygen of the air into carbonic acid and water. The food of carnivorous
animals does not contain non-azotized matters, so that the carbon and hydro-
gen necessary for the production of animal heat are furnished in them from
the waste of their tissues. The transformed matters of the organs are ob-
viously unfit for the further nourishment of the body, that is, for the increase
or reproduction of the mass. They pass through the absorbent and lymph-
atic vessels into the veins, and their accumulation in these would soon put a
stop to the nutritive process, were it not that the blood has to pass through
a filtering apparatus, as it were, before reaching the heart. The venous
blood, before returning to the heart, is made to pass through the liver and
the kidneys, which separate from it all substances incapable of contributing
to nutrition. The new compounds containing the nitrogen of the transformed
organs, being utterly incapable of further application in the system, are ex-
pelled from the body.

    Those, again, which contain the carbon of the transformed tissues, are
collected in the gall-bladder as bile, a compound of soda, which being
mixible with water in every proportion, passes into the duodenum and
mixes with chyme. All the soda of the bile, and ninety-nine-hundredths of
the carbonaceous matter which it contains, retain the capacity of resorption

--by the absorbents of the small and large intestines a capacity which has

been proved by direct experiment.
   The globules of the blood, which in themselves can be shown to take no

share in the nutritive process, serve to transport the oxygen, which they give
up in their passage through the capillary vessels. Here the current of
oxygen meets with the carbonaceous substances of the transformed tissues,
and converts their carbon into carbonic acid, their hydrogen into water.
                                                                               --

                          ON ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.                                49

Every portion of these substances which escapes this process of oxidation, is

sent back into the circulation in the form of bile, which by degrees com-

pletely disappears.

This view of Liebig's, of the use of bile, is highly iugenious and important.

In the young of carnivorous animals, the circulation and the respiration are

more rapid ; but an infinitely wise Providence has furnished in the butter of

the milk of the mother a highly carbonaceous substance, by which the loss of

the organized tissues by the action of the oxygen of the air is prevented. In

the young of carnivorous birds milk is not required, because the absence of

all motion is an obvious cause of a diminished waste in the organs.

It is obvious also, that in the system of the graminivora, whose food con-

tains relatively so small a proportion of the constituents of the blood, the

process of metamorphosis in existing tissues, and consequently their restora-

tion or reproduction, must go on far less rapidly than in the carnivora. Were

this not the case, a vegetation a thousand times more luxuriant would not

suffice for their sustenance. Sugar, gum and starch, which form so large

a proportion of their food, would then be no longer necessary to support life

in these animals, because in that case the products of waste, or metamor-

phosis of the organized tissues, would contain enough of carbon to support

the respiratory process.

Man, when confined to animal food, requires sources of nutriment more

widely extended than the lion and tiger, because when he has an opportunity

he kills without eating. This is the reason that a nation of savage hunters

cannot multiply themselves beyond a certain extent; but when civiliza-

tion reaches them, and they become herbivorous as well as carnivorous,

the population rapidly increases. When exercise is denied to gramini-

vorous and omnivorous animals, this is tantamount to a deficient supply of
oxygen. The carbon of the food not meeting with sufficient oxygen to con-
sume it, it passes into other compounds containing a large excess of carbon

and deficiency of oxygen, or, in other words, fat is produced. It is thus that

the sedentary ladies of oriental countries acquire so much embonpoint, and
stall-fed animals so much fat. That fat does arise in some such way as Liebig

describes is obvious ; for the herbs and roots consumed by the cow contain
no butter ; in the hay or other fodder of oxen no beef-suet exists ; no hog's-
lard can be found in the potato refuse given to swine ; and the food of geese
or fowls contain no goose-fat or capon-fat. The fat must be formed in the

organism, and for this purpose oxygen must be separated from the carbona-

ceous constituents of food. Liebig is led to the startling conclusion, that fat

is altogether an abnormal and unnatural production, arising from the adapta-

tion of nature to circumstances, and not of circumstances to nature, altogether

resulting from a disproportion of carbon in the food to that of the oxygen

respired by the lungs or absorbed by the skin. Wild animals in a state of

nature do not contain fat. The Bedouin or the Arab of the desert, who

shows with pride to the traveller his lean, muscular, sinewy limbs, is altoge-

ther free from fat. And the Professor points out the diseases arising from

this cause, and furnishes some valuable hints to therapeutics.
   From all that has preceded, we may sum up the nutritious elements of food

as follows. The ingredients adapted for the formation of the blood, and

which the Professor calls the plastic elements of nutrition, are as follows :
                                               Vegetable fibrine.

                          Vegetable albumen.

                          Vegetable casein.

                          Animal flesh.

                          Animal blood.

1842.                     e
--50 REPORT 1842.

The other ingredients of food being fitted to sustain the temperature of the

body, he calls the elements of respiration. They are,

Fat.          Sugar of milk.

Starch.       Pectine.
              Bassorine.
Gum.
              Wine.
Cane-sugar.

Grape-sugar.  Beer.

                                                                                               Spirits.

   Having been led to give at such length an account of Professor Liebig's
general principles of nutrition, we must dismiss with a mere announcement
the details of which the second part of his work consist. In this he examines
the chemical processes engaged in the production of bile, of urea, uric acid
and its compounds, as well as of cerebral and nervous substance. The con-
clusions to which he has arrived on these subjects are of the most intense in-
terest, and have surprised their author as much as they must his reader. In
fact, we dare not venture to make an abstract of them, without entering into
the calculations with which they are accompanied,, lest their beautiful har-
mony with known operations would incline the reader to think that they are
the creations of a brilliant imagination, instead of being (as they are) the re-

sults of sober calculation.

   His explanatory remarks on digestion are highly beautiful, and we cannot
pass them without referring to the singular function which he ascribes to

saliva.

    In the action of gastric juice on the food, no other element participates
except the oxygen of the atmosphere and the elements of water. During
the mastication of food the fluid saliva is secreted into the mouth. This fluid
possesses the remarkable property of enclosing air in the shape of froth, in a
far higher degree even than soap-suds. This air, by means of the saliva, ac-
companies the food into the stomach, and there its oxygen enters into combi-
nation with the constituents of the food, whilst its nitrogen is again given

out through the lungs or skin. This, then, accounts for the fact discovered

by physiologists, that pure nitrogen is given out by the lungs and skin. The

greater the resistance of the food, that is, the longer digestion continues, the
greater is the quantity of saliva, and consequently of air, which enters the
stomach. Rumination, in certain graminivorous animals, has plainly for one
object a renewed and repeated introduction of oxygen ; for a. mere mechani-

cal division of the food only shortens the time required for solution. Of
course, the Professor does not mean to infer that this is the only mode by

which oxygen enters the stomach ; it does so also by the property possessed

by all animal tissues of being permeable to air.
    The Professor, in treating of the formation of bile, shows the very inter-

esting result, that if the formula of the compounds existing in urine and
those of the bile be added together, we obtain the precise formula of the
blood ; as was indeed to be expected from his view, that the nitrogenous
matters go principally to the former fluid, the carbonaceous matters to the

latter. He enters largely into the hitherto mysterious transformations of

bile into choleic acid, taurine, &c. ; and as a consequence of this examination
he obtains the remarkable result, that if the elements of prcteine and starch
(oxygen and water being also present) undergo transformation together and
mutually affect each other, Ave obtain, as the products of this metamorphosis,
urea, choleic acid, ammonia and carbonic acid, and besides these no products
whatever ! This is full of significance with regard to the processes which

we actually know to proceed in the animal ceconomy.

    Following out the subject still further, he accounts very happily for the
                     ON ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.                      51

formation of calculi ; a subject upon which, for obvious reasons, we cannot

enter. In fact, in this second part of his report, all the most interesting
transformations of the food of the various organs and tissues of the body are

discussed with his usual success. Whilst examining the action of organic
remedial agents on the animal ceconomy, he touches upon the use of tea and

coffee as an article of food ; and as this is a subject of very general interest,
we will briefly state his opinions.

It is well known that recent chemical research has proved the fact, which

the boldest imagination dared not have ventured to conceive, that the active

principles of tea and coffee, viz. theine and caffeine, are absolutely one and the
same body, being perfectly identical in every respect. The presence of this

iu two vegetables belonging to different natural families, and derived from

different quarters of the globe, proves that the action of tea and coffee on the
system must be the same. Some cause there must be to explain how the

practice of taking them has become a necessary of life to whole nations.

Now caffeine (theine) is a highly nitrogenized body. Bile, it is well known,

Nowcontains an essential nitrogenized ingredient, taurine.      Professor Liebig

considers that caffeine goes to the production of this taurine ; and by calcu-

lating the formulas of both, he shows, that if nine atoms of water and nine
atoms of oxygen be added to the formula of caffeine, we obtain the formula

of two atoms of taurine. Two and eight-tenths of a grain of caffeine is sufficient
to form the taurine contained in one ounce of bile ; and if we admit that the

infusion of tea consumed contained no more than one-tenth of a grain of caf-

feine, still if it contribute in point of fact to the formation of bile, the action

even of such a quantity cannot be looked upon as nullity.

Neither can it be denied, that in case of using an excess of non-azotized

food, or deficiency of motion, which is required to cause the change of matter

in the tissues, and thus to yield the nitrogenized matter of the bile ; that in
such a condition the state of health may be benefited by the use of tea or
coffee, by which may be furnished the nitrogenized product produced in the

healthy state of the body, and essential to the production of an important

element of respiration. It is only in a chemical sense that these remarks are

intended to show, that such compounds as caffeine or theine, asparagine and

theobromine, are better adapted to this purpose than all other vegetable

principles.

The American Indian, with his present habits of living solely on flesh,

could not with any comfort use tea as an article of food, for his tissues waste

with such rapidity, that, on the contrary, he has to take something to retard

this waste. And it is worthy of remark, that he has discovered in tobacco

smoke a means of retarding the change of matter in the tissues of his body,

and thereby of making hunger more endurable ; and that he cannot with-

stand the captivation of brandy, which, acting as an element of respiration,

puts a stop to the change of matter by performing the function which pro-
perly belongs to the products of the metamorphosed tissues. With the Indian
savages, brandy administers to their feelings of comfort, which tea in their

cases would not do.

The third part of Professor Liebig's report treats of the recondite laws of

the phenomena of motion. His observations on these fully bear out the high
character of the other parts of the report ; but as they require more detail iu
order to be understood, we can better afford to shorten our abstract by

merely referring to the report itself.

   The Professor concludes his valuable communication by two chapters, one
on the Theory of Disease, the other on the Theory of Respiration. With a

very few words on these subjects, we will close this abstract.

                                        e2
--52 REPORT 1842.

The whole life of animals consists of a conflict between chemical forces

and the vital power. In the normal state of the body of an adult both stand

in equilibrium ; that is, there is an equilibrium between the manifestations of
the causes of waste and the causes of supply. Every mechanical or chemical

agency which disturbs the restoration of this equilibrium is a cause of disease.
Disease occurs when the resistance offered by the vital force is weaker than

the acting cause of disturbance.

Death is that condition in which chemical or mechanical powers gain the

ascendency, and all resistance on the part of the vital force ceases. This re-

sistance never entirely departs from living tissues during life. Every abnormal

-condition of supply or waste may be called disease.

But it is evident that one and the same cause of disease, that is, of disturb-

Aance, will have different effects according to the period of life.  cause of

disease added to the cause of waste, may in old age annihilate the resistance

of the vital power, or, in other words, occasion death ; while in the adult

state it may produce only a disproportion between supply and waste, and in

infancy only an abstract state of health, i.e. an equilibrium between supply and

waste.

   Now from what has preceded, it is obvious that a deficiency of resistance

in a living part to the cause of waste is in fact a deficiency of resistance to

the action of the oxygen of the atmosphere. Professor Liebig has shown,

in that part of the report which I have omitted, that the phaenomena of mo-

tion are dependent upon the change of matter ; consequently, if by a diseased
transformation of living tissues a greater amount of force be generated than

is necessary for the production of the normal motions, it is seen in an acce-

leration of the involuntary motions, as well as in a higher temperature of

the diseased part.

This condition is called Fever.

And when a great excess of force is produced by change of matter, the

force, since it can only be consumed by motion, extends itself to the appara-

tus of voluntary motion.

This state is called a Febrile Paroxys.

Should there be any products formed during disease, which the organs in

their immediate vicinity cannot employ in their own vital functions, erema-
causis will ensue, which may be communicated to other parts of the body.
The physician sometimes removes those diseased conditions by exciting an

artificial diseased state in their vicinity, such as by blisters or by setons. In

this case he throws a less important part of the body into a state in which it

more readily yields to the oxygen, and therefore removes the causes of waste

from the diseased organ. When this cause of waste is reduced, the resistance

or vital force increases, and renovates the part removed by oxygen.

In cases of a different kind, where artificial external disturbance produces

no effect, the physician adopts other indirect methods to exalt the resistance

offered by the vital force. He diminishes the number of blood-carriers (the
globules), and by this means the cause of change. He excludes from the

food all matter capable of conversion into blood, and gives chiefly or entirely

non-azotized food, which supports the respiratory process.

In regard to the nature of the vital force, it is plain that it must be con-

nected with other physical forces, for its manifestations are similar; it is de-

void of consciousness or volition, and is, as we know, subject to the action of

a blister.

   Perhaps we cannot give a better notion of the Professor's theory than by
comparing the human body to a self-regulating steam-engine.

Every one knows that the tube which conveys the steam to the cylinder,
                       ;

ON ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.  53

where the piston-rod is to be raised, contains a stop-cock of a peculiar con-

struction, through which the steam must pass. By an arrangement connected
with the regulating-wheel, this stop-cock opens when the wheel moves slower,
and shuts when it moves more rapidly than is necessary to produce a uniform
motion. When it opens, more force (steam) is admitted, and the motion of
the machine is accelerated. When the stop-cock shuts, the steam is more or

less cut off, the force in the cylinder diminishes, the tension of the steam or

force increases, and is preserved for subsequent use. The force, that is, the
tension of the vapour, is produced by the change of matter by the combustion
of coals. The force increases with the temperature of the fire-place. There
are in these engines other arrangements, all intended for regulation. When
the force augments beyond a certain point, the channels for the admission of
air close themselves, combustion is diminished, and less force generated
but when the engine goes slower more steam is admitted to the cylinder, its
tension decreases, the air-passages are opened, and the cause of the disen-
gagement of heat, that is, of the production of force, increases. Another
arrangement supplies the fire-place incessantly with coals, in proportion as

they are wanted.

   The body, in regard to the production of heat and of force (in Liebig's
view), acts just like one of those machines. With the lowering of the external
temperature, the respiration becomes deeper and more frequent ; oxygen is
supplied in greater quantity and of greater density ; the change of matter is
increased ; and more food must be supplied if the temperature of the body is

to remain unchanged.

    It has been proved that iron is not necessary to the colouring matter of the
blood, but that it forms an essential constituent of blood-globules. These
globules, it is well known, take no part in nutrition. Liebig proves that iron
is contained in a state of protoxide in venous, and in the state of sesquioxide
in arterial blood. The latter very readily yields its oxygen to organic matter,
the former becomes very readily oxidized ; but the sesquioxide, in yielding
its oxygen to organic tissues, produces carbonic acid, which (according to
well-known facts) protoxide of iron readily absorbs. The globules of blood
darken when exposed to carbonic acid gas, but become florid when exposed
to oxygen, whilst all the carbonic acid is again evolved. Therefore,, the or-
ganic compound of iron which exists in venous blood, recovers in the lungs
the oxygen which it had lost, and liberates its carbonic acid. Professor
Liebig conceives that the iron is therefore the great means of conveying to
the lungs the carbonic acid formed in the system ; and he has made a calcu-

lation of how much the iron contained in the body could thus actually con-
vey, and the result of the calculation shows that twice as much carbonic acid

could thus be conveyed as actually is expelled daily from the system.

   In conclusion, I entreat that this abstract may not be regarded as doing
justice to Professor Liebig. It is difficult indeed to abstract from a work in
which every sentence contains some new views, if possible, more interesting
and more important than those preceding. And when the very unfavour-

able circumstances under which this abstract was prepared are considered,

I am sure that justice will be done to my learned friend by consulting the

report itself.

   In the opinion of all, Liebig may be considered a benefactor to his species,
for the interesting discoveries in agriculture published by him in the first
part of this report. And having in that pointed out means by which the food
of the human race may be increased, in the work now before us he follows
up the chain in its continuation, and shows how that food may best be
adapted to the nutrition of man. Surely there are no two subjects more
--54 REPORT 1842.

fitted than these for the contemplation of the philosopher ; and by the con-
summate sagacity with which Liebig has applied to their elucidation the
powers of his mind, we are compelled to admit that there is no living philo-

sopher to whom the Chemical Section could have more appropriately entrusted

their investigation.

Report on the British Fossil Mammalia. By Richard Owen, Esq.,

                      Part I. Unguiculata and Cetacea.

By many recent valuable works there may be evidently discerned in the

labours of the Naturalists of the present day a tendency to the acquisition
of complete and precise knowledge of the animals and plants of particular
countries and localities. The birds of Europe, the freshwater fishes of the
same continent, the vertebrated animals of Italy, those of the northern re-
gions of America, the fishes of Scandinavia, have had respectively their
historians in a Gould, an Agassiz, a Bonaparte, a Richardson, and a Nillson ;

and, not to mention many other fauna? and florae of foreign countries, the
series of excellent zoological works, published by Mr. Van Voorst, have in-
 cluded able surveys by our most eminent Naturalists of the existing species

 of different classes of animals of Great Britain.

    The British Association has favorably promoted the acquisition of analo-
gous knowledge of the extinct animals of these islands, and the result of such
 investigations in regard to one class, encourages their application to other

 departments of primaeval zoology.

   How marvellous is the contrast, for example, which the catalogue of the

 British Fossil Reptiles presents in regard to the number, diversity, bulk, and
 outward forms of its subjects, with that of the existing species ! In this com-
 parison Prof. Bell's instructive volume on British Reptiles seems to form but a
 small appendix to that which treats of the extinct forms ; to so small a group
 of diminutive species have the cold-blooded air-breathing animals dwindled
 down in our portion of the earth's surface.

    The .contrast promises to be, though not so striking, still very great, be-
 tween the catalogues of the extinct and existing British Mammalia ; and in

 undertaking, at the request of the Association, the present survey of the British

 Fossil Quadrupeds and Whales, the number and variety of these have made it
 requisite to divide the subject, and prolong the researches which it demands

 into another year.
     It is proposed in this Report to record the fossil remains of extinct British

 Mammalia; first, according to their zoological relations, following them in
 the descending order ; and, secondly, to enumerate them according to the
 strata, and in the same order.

    The present division of the Report includes the Quadrumana, Clieiroptera,
 Insectivora, Carnivora, Bodentia, Marsupialia, and Cetacea.

     This simple enumeration makes known the remarkable fact, that two
 orders of Mammalia, one of which has totally disappeared from the conti-
 nents of the old world of the geographer, and the other is hardly recognized
 as European, have once possessed representatives in the land which now
  forms the island of Great Britain. So that whilst the Zoologist, enumerating
 the existing mammals of this island, finds the nearest approach to man in
 the diminutive bats, the palaeontologist, by the extinct forms, can ascend
 another step, and commence his catalogue with a species of the quadruma-

 nous order.

    The existence of this genus during the earlier tertiary epochs was esta-
blished by the discovery, in sand, beneath a stratum of blue clay, at Kyson
near Woodbridge, Suffolk, of a fragment of a lower jaw, including the socket
of the last molar, with that highly characteristic tooth entire and in place,
and the anterior part of the base of the coronoid process. This fossil was
determined by me in August 1839* ; it was of a dark colour and brittle
from the loss of its original animal matter, but less absorbent than the cave
fossils usually are. The crown of the tooth presents five tubercles, the four
anterior ones being arranged in two transverse pairs, the fifth forming the
posterior heel or talon. This conformation of the crown of the last molar of
the lower jaw, is characteristic, as is well known, of two families of catarrhine
or old-world monkeys,--the Semnopithecidce, including Semnopithecus and
 Colobus, and the Macacidce including Macacus, Cynocephalus and Papio.
In the Semnopithecidce the fifth tubercle or talon is large but simple. In
most of the Macacidce it presents two cusps, the outer one being much
larger than the inner one. This character is well marked in the fossil, and
reduces it to the lower group, or Macacidce; in which, after a close com-
parison with several recent species, it appears to me to come nearest to the
true Macaci. But the fossil exhibits the following differences from the re-

--cent Macaci : the whole tooth is rather narrower in proportion to its length

the transverse ridge at the anterior part of the tooth crossing the base of the
two anterior tubercles is a little more prominent, and passes more obliquely
from the outer to the inner side ; the second transverse ridge uniting the

first pair of tubercles, rises nearer to their summits ; the portion of the jaw
is more compressed than the corresponding part of the jaw in the recent
Macaci; the internal wall of the socket of the tooth is flatter and much
thinner ; the ridge on the outer side of the alveolus, which forms the com-
mencement of the anterior margin of the coronoid process, begins closer to
the tooth. These characters are sufficiently important and well-marked to
establish the specific distinctions of the Macacque to which the portion of
the jaw belongs, and are the more valuable as corroborating the evidence
already adduced in proof that the fragment in question is a true fossil of the
Eocene stratum in which it wus discoveredf.

  A second specimen of the fossil Macacus consists of the crown and one

fang of the second molar, left side, lower jaw ; or the tooth which corre-
sponds with the second ' bicuspis ' in human anatomy ; it was discovered in
the same stratum and locality as the preceding. The crown presents four
tubercles arranged in two transverse pairs, the anterior pair being the most
distinctly developed, and rising the highest ; there is also a very small ridge
at the anterior, and another at the posterior side of the crown ; the latter is
placed between and connects together the two posterior tubercles. The
fangs are two, strong and divergent ; the anterior one has been broken off.
The grinding surface of the tooth presents two depressions, a small one in
front of the anterior pair of tubercles, and a larger one between the two pairs
of tubercles. The tooth has evidently belonged to an old individual, for the
tubercles are worn, and the posterior concavity is smoothed and deepened
by attrition. It differs from the corresponding tooth of a recent Macacus

   * See Magazine of Natural History, 1839, p. 444.

  At newspaper critic, when this discover}' was first announced, suggested that the sup-

posed fossil might be nothing more than the remains of some monkey belonging to a
travelling menagerie, which had died and been cast out in the progress through Suffolk.
--56 REPORT 1842.

of the same size in having a slight ridge along the base of the anterior part
of the crown, and in being a little narrower from side to side, and the same
characters distinguish the posterior molar of the fossil Macacus above de-
scribed. As, moreover, the present fossil molar bears exactly the same pro-
portion to the above-mentioned fossil posterior molar, which obtains in the
corresponding teeth of the recent Macaci, I have no doubt that the two fos-
sil teeth belong to the same species of extinct Macacus.

    The evidence on which this ancient British monkey has been recognized,
is of the same nature as that which has proved the existence of another and
higher organized Quadrumane, in a contemporary formation in the South of
France. During the life-time of Cuvier no fossil referable to the quadru-
manous order had been discovered in any part of the world. Such remains
have, however, been subsequently determined not only from tertiary strata
in England and France, but also from tertiary beds in the East Indies and
South America ; four different genera of apes and monkeys being now known
to have co-existed with the stranger Mammalia of the tertiary periods which
have become extinct.

                                        Order Cheiroptera.

   The most common situations in which the fossil bones of the bat- tribe
have been met with are the bone-caves, in some of which, as in the cavern
at Kostritz, they occur mixed with the bones of existing as well as extinct
animals, and may have been introduced at a recent period. I shall not,

therefore, here notice the remains of existing species of bats found in the
superficial stalactites of caves, and which appear also to have been acci-

dentally and recently introduced, like the remains of the human species, into

caves containing the true fossil bones of extinct animals.
    In the cavern called Kent's Hole, near Torbay, Devon, fragments of the

skeleton of a bat have been found so associated with the remains of the ex-

Atinct animals as to claim a like antiquity. ramus of the lower jaw presents

two large cuspidated molars in place, the socket of a third, those of two small

premolars, and a canine, from which I am disposed to refer these fossils to the

genus Rhinolophus, typified by the horse-shoe bat of the present fauna.

  A species of small insectivore, referable only, as it appears to me, to the

bat-tribe, has left indications of its presence during the remote tertiary pe-
riods in which the Macacus, already described, existed. These indications
consist of two molar teeth, apparently the last and penultimate of the right
side of the lower jaw.

   One of these small grinders (penultimate or antepenultimate grinder) has
the crown composed of four triangular prisms, placed in two transverse rows,
with an angle turned outwards, and a side or flat surface inwards, the sum-
mits being sharp-pointed. The exterior prisms are the largest ; the crown
swells out abruptly above the fangs, defending them as it were by an over-
hanging ridge. There is a small transverse eminence or talon at the anterior
part of the crown ; and a very small tubercle is placed between the bases of
the two external prisms. The second molar differs from the preceding in
having the two posterior prisms suppressed, and replaced by a flattened tri-
angular surface. The anterior prisms are present, and their apices project
far beyond the level of the posterior surface. There is a small ridge at the
anterior part of the tooth. These teeth agree more nearly with the ante-
penultimate and last molars of the larger insectivorous bats, than with any
other teeth with which I have as yet compared them ; they differ chiefly in

the presence of the small tubercle at the basal interspace of the exterior

prisms ; a difference which M. de Blainville regards as ground for doubting
ON BRITISH FOSSIL MAMMALIA.                         57

the legitimacy of their approximation to the Cheiropterous order at all*.

Since, however, an anatomist so familiar by his recent researches with all

the modifications of the teeth of the Mammalia has been unable to refer the

fossil molars in question to any of the terrestrial or aquatic genera of Insec-

mytivora, but has given  figures of these molars a place in the plate illus-

trating the ancient Vespertiliones in his ' Osteography,' I deduce from that

myfact additional confidence in  original determination. It is to the grinders

of a tropical species of Molossus, in the collection of Mr. Cuming, that the

present British fossils make the nearest approach.

                                          Order Insectivora.

                                              Genus Talpa.

    Moles have been introduced into the retreats of owls and other birds of
prey, and these remains have been detected in the earth at the bottom of
caves, as in that at Pavilandf, but these cannot be regarded as true fossils.

   The almost entire skeleton, figured as a Saurian in the ' Geology of Bacton,'
by Mr. Green, unquestionably belongs to the genus Talpa, as I have ascer-
tained by examination of the characteristic humeri, which in the figure
alluded to are placed so as to correspond with the coracoid and pelvic bones
of Saurians. This mole's skeleton was discovered in a lacustrine deposit
consisting of a greenish kind of mud intermixed with sand, underlying a
stratum of bluish mud, with patches of brown clay, itself covered by the
hard ferruginous crag and the superficial till.

   The associated skeleton I of a quadruped, combining a dentition like that
of the ruminants, with, apparently, a divided metacarpus and metatarsus, as
in the Anoplotherhim gracile, would indicate this formation to belong to the
older tertiary series ; but of this I shall be enabled to speak with more cer-
tainty, after a personal examination of the fossil and strata previous to the
preparation of that part of the present report which will treat of the herbivo-
rous Mammalia.

                                             Genus Sorex.

    Fossil remains of shrew-mice have been found in the bone-cave at Kent's
Hole § ; in the collections of bones in the raised beaches near Plymouth,
and in other recent formations : they offer no evidence of species distinct

from those now existing in Great Britain.

                                       Genus Amphitherium.

   The mammalian fossils which have excited most interest, and been the
subject of closest examination and warmest discussion, are the small jaws

from the oolitic calcareous slate at Stonesfield near Oxford, first indicated
as evidence of the mammalian class by Dr. Buckland, in his celebrated
paper on the Megalosaums, published in 1823 in the ' Transactions of the
Geological Society of London,' vol. i. 2nd series, p. 399 ; and there referred,
on the authority of Cuvier, to the genus Didelphys.

  A statement of so much importance as that of the existence of the remains

of a terrestrial mammal in a secondary formation, much lower than the
chalk, excited, as might be expected, much scepticism and close inquiry,

first, in regard to the geological relations of the alleged oolitic stratum, and

next as to the zoological affinities of the fossils.

   The first exception to any generalization which has assumed the cha-
racter of a law, is always admitted with difficulty, and by the strict or
mechanical systematists with reluctance. The geological arguments by
which M. Prevost endeavoured to invalidate the conclusions of Dr. Buck-
land, were soon and satisfactorily refuted by Dr. Fitton ; and the question

as to the real age of the rock containing the bones in question has not since

been agitated. The attempts to remove the supposed anomaly by inter-

preting the appearances in the fossils as indications of a cold-blooded spe-
cies, have been more frequent and persevering; and they assumed the
character of so systematic a refutation of the Cuvierian view, in the me-

moirs communicated by M. de Blainville to the French Academy in the

year 1838, that a close and thorough re-examination of the fossils in ques-
tion became imperatively called for, in order that the doubts cast upon their
mammalian nature might be tested. For this purpose the original fossil jaw
described by Dr. Buckland, and those subsequently obtained from the
Stonesfield slate and preserved in the Oxford Museum, were submitted to

my inspection. I carefully examined the specimen described by Mr. Brode-

rip and presented by him to the British Museum, and likewise that which is
preserved in the Museum of the Philosophical Society at York. The results
of these examinations were communicated to the Geological Society, and
have been published with new and more exact figures of the fossils in the
6th vol., 2nd series, of the Transactions of the Society.

   By a very singular coincidence the mammalian fossils from the Stones-

field slate, hitherto determined, are all portions of the loAver jaw ; whether

belonging to individuals of different species, or of different genera, or even,

as appears by examination of new specimens acquired since the publication

of my memoir of 1838, of different orders of Mammalia.

   The first fossil was referred originally to the genus Didelphys, from the
resemblance of the grinders to those of the opossums ; but Cuvier expressly
states that they exceeded in number the molar series in that or any other known
carnivorous genus of mammal. M. Agassiz, originally regarding this fossil as
insufficient to determine the nature of the animal to which it belonged, sub-
sequently proposed, nevertheless, a generic name, Ampltigonus, for that
animal, expressive of its supposed ambiguous nature. M. de Blainville,
likewise, though participating in the incertitude or doubt which M. Agassiz
had cast upon the original determination of the Stonesfield fossil, had as
little hesitation in suggesting a name for the new genus which it seemed to

indicate, whatever might subsequently prove to be its characters or affinities ;
and it is remarkable that the Greek compound ' Amphitherium,' should
imply by its terminal element a relation to the class Mammalia, which the

two memoirs read to the French Academy by its inventor were designed to

 disprove.

    M. Valenciennes, in his reply to M. de Blainville, arriving at the conclu-
sion that the fossil jaw described and figured by M. Prevost and Dr. Buck-
land not only belonged to a mammalian but likewise to a marsupial animal,

 proposed for it a third generic name, indicative of these presumed affinities,

 viz. Thylacotherium.

    The arguments of M. Valenciennes were opposed in a second detailed
 memoir by M. de Blainville, who concluded by stating that he felt himself

 compelled to pause, at least until fresh evidence was produced, in the con-
 viction that the portions of fossil jaws found at Stonesfield, certainly did not
 belong to a marsupial probably not to a mammalian genus, either insectivo-

----rous or amphibious that, on the contrary, it was most likely the animal had

 been oviparous, and that, had not M. Agassiz decidedly given his opinion
                                                                               ;

against the fossils in question belonging to fishes, he would rather have been
led to suppose that they might have been the remains of an animal of that

class.

   With respect to the term ' amphibious,' in M. de Blainville's conclusion,
this has reference to a later opinion expressed by M. Agassiz*, who, admit-
ting the Stonesfield fossils to be certainly those of mammals, rejects them

from the marsupial and insectivorous orders, observing that " each separate
tooth resembles the greater part of those of seals, near which group (am-
phibious Carnivora) the animal to which the jaws belonged should form a

distinct genus. In fact," adds M. Agassiz, " the aspect of these fossil

fragments is so peculiar, that it draws our attention towards aquatic animals
rather than away from them."

  A mammiferous animal, not larger than the water-shrew, may manifest

aquatic habits, but can hardly be supposed to have been piscivorous, or to
have been endowed with instincts and an organisation like those of the
seals ; at all events it must be admitted, in the absence of any evidence of
the locomotive extremities, that such an affinity can only be matter of mere
conjecture ; which a close examination of the dental and maxillary characters
will show to have little probability.

    The fossil first discovered by Professor Buckland, and figured by the Pro-
fessor, by M. Prevost and myself, is the left ramus of a lower jaw wanting
the anterior extremity, containing ten of the molar teeth more or less broken,
and measuring ten lines in length.

  --This specimen, however, plainly exhibits, first, a convex articular con-

dyle ; secondly, an indubitable and well-defined impression of what was once
a broad, thin, high, and slightly recurved triangular coronoid process, rising

immediately anterior to the condyle, having its basis extended over the
whole of the interspace between the condyle and the commencement of the
molar series, and having a vertical diameter equal to that of the horizontal
ramus of the jaw itself; thirdly, the angle of the jaw continued to nearly the
same extent below the condyle as the coronoid process reaches above it, and
with its apex continued backwards in the form of a process ; fourthly, the
parts above described forming one continuous portion with the horizontal
ramus of the jaw, which is not compounded of three or four distinct pieces.

As respects this last statement, it is to be observed that an inferior marginal
groove has been considered as evidence of the composite structure of the
jaw under consideration ; but there is no other mark that could be inter-

preted as an indication of this reptilian structure, whilst a similar groove
characterizes the lower jaw of the marsupial Myrmecobius and Wombat, and
of some large species of Sorex.

   M. de Blainville was led to suppose that there was no trace of a convex

condyle, but that in its place there existed an articular fissure, somewhat as
in the jaws of fishes ; that the teeth, instead of being imbedded in sockets,
had their fangs confluent with, or anchylosed to, the substance of the jaws

and that the jaw itself presented evident traces of a composite structure.
   The point, therefore, which first demanded the closest attention, was

the actual condition, in the Stonesfield fossils, of the articular or condyloid
process, in regard to which they give the same evidence. In the jaw examined

by Cuvier, in the second specimen of the same species examined by M. Va-
lenciennes, and in the lower jaw of another genus described and figured by
Mr. Broderip, a prominent convex articular condyle is more or less distinctly
revealed ; it is most entire and unequivocal in Mr. Broderip's specimen which

--60 REPORT 1842.

I shall subsequently describe. What M. de Blainville has mistaken for an
articular fissure, " une sorte d'6chancrure, articulaire un peu comnae dans

les poissons," must be the entering angle or notch, either above or below the

true articular condyle.

   The angle of the jaw in the original fossil is produced backwards in the

form of a process, as in the insectivorous and in all the carnivorous Mam-

malia, with the exception of the seals ; but it could not be determined in

that specimen whether this process was likewise bent inwards in the way

Awhich so strikingly characterizes the Marsupialia.  very complete half-

lower jaw from Stonesfield, obtained since my paper was printed in the

Geological Transactions, determines this question in the negative ; and at the

same time, therefore, turns the scale of evidence in favour of the affinities

of the present ancient mammal to the placental insectivora.

   Before, however, describing this fossil, I shall proceed to offer a few ob-

servations on the second specimen of Amphitherium figured in my paper in

the Geological Transactions ; and on the evidence which it affords of the

affinities of this most interesting genus.

In this specimen the whole of the exposed surface of the lower jaw, with

the exception of the coronoid, articular and angular processes, is entire ; the

smooth surface near the anterior extremity of the jaw is in bold relief, and

slopes away at nearly a right angle from the rougher articular surface of the

elongated symphysis. It may be supposed that this symphysial surface,

which at once determines the side of the jaw, might be obscured in the

plaster cast studied by M. de Blainville, but there is no possibility of mis-

taking it in the fossil itself; it is long and narrow, and is continued forwards

in the same line with the gently convex inferior margin of the jaw, which

thus tapers gradually to a pointed anterior extremity, precisely as in the jaws

of the Didelphys as well as in other Insectivora, both of the marsupial

and placental series. Its lower margin presents a small but pretty deep

notch, which possesses every appearance of a natural structure, and a corre-

sponding but shallower notch is present in the same part of the jaw of the

Myrmecobius. In the relative length of the symphysis, as in its form and po-

sition, the jaw of the Amphitherium corresponds with that of the Didelphys,

AMyrmecobius and Gymnurus.  greater proportion of the convex articular

condyle is preserved in this than in the foregoing specimen, and it projects

backward to a greater extent. The precise contour of the coronoid process

is not so neatly defined in this as in the first specimen of Amphitherium, but

sufficient remains to show that it had the same height and width.
   The exposed surface of the coronoid process is slightly convex. The sur-

face of the ascending ramus of the jaw is entire above the angle, whence we

may conclude that if the process from the latter part had been continued

directly backwards, it would also have been entire ; but the extremity of the

angular process is broken off, proving it to have originally inclined inwards

or towards the observer : as, however, the greater part of the angle is entire,

it could not have been inflected to the same extent as in the Didelphys,

ADasyurus, or the Phascolotherium next to be described.      groove is ex-

tended from the lower end of the articular condyle forward to the orifice of

the canal for the dental artery, where it divides ; the upper branch terminates

in the dental orifice, the lower and larger division is continued forward near

the lower margin of the jaw, and is gradually filled up half way towards the

symphysis : this smooth vascular groove has no resemblance to an articular

fissure. There is a broader and snorter groove in the corresponding part of
the jaw of the Myrmecobius ; and a narrower groove in that of the Wombat.
The alveolar wall of the posterior grinders makes a convex projection, cha-

racteristic of the inner surface of the ramus of the lower jaw. The posterior

grinder in the present jaw is fortunately more complete than in the first ex-
ample, and shows a small, middle, internal cusp, with part of a large external
cusp, both projecting from the crown of the tooth in nearly the same transverse

line. The enamel covering the internal cusp, which is vertically fractured, is
beautifully distinct from the ivory, and considerably thicker in proportion to
the size of the tooth than is the enamel or its analogue in the teeth of any spe-

cies of reptile, recent or fossil. The six molars anterior to the one in place, are
broken off close to the sockets ; both the fifth and fourth false molars are en-
tire : the anterior cusp presents the same superior size as in the first specimen.
The thick external enamel, and the silky, iridescent lustre of the compact ivory,
are beautifully shown in these teeth. The third and second grinders are more
fractured than in the first specimen, but sufficient remains to show that they
possess the same form and relative size ; but the most interesting evidence as
regards the teeth, which the present jaw affords, is the existence of the sockets
of not less than seven te'eth, anterior to those above described. Of these
sockets the four anterior ones are small and simple, like those of the mole,
being more equal in their size and interspaces than in the Didelphys. The
fifth socket contained a small premolar with double fangs, and so likewise

did the sixth and seventh sockets. Thus the two false molars, with perfect
crowns in the present specimen, are the eighth and ninth teeth, counting

backwards, or the fourth and fifth of their class, viz. premolares or false

molars. This fossil, therefore, gives evidence that the dental formula of the

Amphitherium must have included thirty-two teeth in the lower jaw (sixteen

on each side) ; that these, instead of presenting an uniform, compressed, tri-

cuspid structure and being all of one kind, were divided into three series as

regards their form : five, if not six, of the posterior teeth are quinque-cuspi-

date, and must be regarded as molares veri. Some of the molares spurii are
tricuspid and some bicuspid, as in the opossums ; but these are six, if not
seven in number. Anterior to the molars are four simple teeth, of which the

fourth may be regarded as the representative of the canine, and the anterior
three as incisors. Thus the Amphitherium differs considerably from the ge-
nus Didelphys in the number of its teeth. Indeed at the time when Cuvier
wrote respecting it, believing it to have had ten molars, no mammiferous
ferine quadruped was known to possess a greater number of these teeth

than the Chrysochlore, which has nine molars on each side of the upper jaw,
and eight molars on each side of the lower jaw. The Chrysochlore, however,

is not the only mammal in which the molars exceed the number usually
found in the unguiculate Mammalia. The marsupial genus, Myrmecobius,

has nine molars on each side of the lower jaw, besides one small canine and

three conical incisors.

    The teeth of Amphitherium, moreover, differ from those of Didelphys not
only in number but also in size, being relatively smaller. The teeth of Myr-
mecobius, besides their approximation in number to those of Amphitherium,
resemble them in their small relative size more than do those of Didelphys,
but they are still smaller than in Amphitherium, which in this respect, as

well as in the structure of the teeth, appears to hold an intermediate posi-

tion between Didelphys and Myrmecobius. The Didelphys Prevostii being
evidently, as Cuvier states, a distinct genus from Didelphys properly so
called, a distinct generic name was no doubt desirable for it, and the term

Amphitherium fulfils all the requisite conditions. In my memoir of 1838 I
ventured to observe in reference to the new name proposed by M. Valen-

ciennes, that it would have been more prudent to have chosen one less de-
 scriptive than Thylacotherium, since the affinities of the fossil insectivore to
--62 report 1842.

the marsupial order were indicated only with a certain degree of probability,
and required further evidence before the desired demonstration could be at-
tained. But the determination of the particular order of mammals to which
the fossils in question belonged, was a matter of very inferior importance to
the discovery of the class of vertebrate animals in which it ought to rank.
In reference to this point the evidence afforded by the two jaws above de-

scribed, decisively proves, in my opinion, that they belong to a true, warm-

blooded, mammiferous species, referrible also to the higher or unguiculate
division of the class Mammalia, and to an insectivorous genus ; with a pro-
bability of the marsupial character of such genus.

   The probability entertained in 1838, and supported by the degree of re-
semblance between AmplritJierium and 3Iyrmecobius in the number and form
of the molar series of teeth, has since been diminished, if not destroyed, by
the discovery of the right ramus of a lower jaw, presenting its external sur-
face to the observer, and in which the angular pi'ocess is shown not to have
extended inwards. This jaw, now in the possession of Prof. Buckland, con-
tains the whole series of twelve molar teeth, the last six being quinque-cus-
pidate ; the six anterior ones uni-cuspidate, with one or two small basal ac-
cessory cusps ; one small canine and three small incisors ; altogether amount-
ing to sixteen teeth on each side of the lower jaw, as indicated by the sockets
of the second specimen above described. The convex condyle, the broad
and high coronoid process, the projecting angle, the varied kinds and double-

rooted implantation of the teeth, all unequivocally displayed in this fossil,
establish the conclusions which I had deduced from the foregoing fossils, of

the existence of a small insectivorous mammal during the oolitic epoch ; and

turn the scale in favour of the placental affinities of this ancient insectivore,

for which, therefore, I shall retain the generic name Amphitherium, in pre-
ference to the later one of Thylacothe?'ium, proposed by M. Valenciennes.
Other fossils, also portions of the lower jaw, establish the existence of small
Mammalia in the oolitic slate of Stonesfield ; but they present more decided
characters of the marsupial order, and will be, therefore, noticed after a sur-
vey of the fossils belonging to the larger placental Carnivora.

UrSIDjE.

In regard to the larger extinct carnivorous quadrupeds, the remains of

which are dispersed in the superficial drift or diluvial gravel, but are more

especially accumulated in caves, it has been proved, chiefly by the researches

of Dr. Buckland, that England differs very remarkably from the rest of

Europe in the small number of its ancient bears as compared with the

hyaenas; the proportionate numbers of Ursus spelceus and Hyarna spelcea

Howbeing reversed in the island and on the continent.  far this difference

may be taken as an indication of some geographical separation having ex-

isted at the remote period of these beasts of prey, analogous to that which

now divides us from the continent, may be worthy of closer inquiry ; but

the facts in regard to the Carnivora in question are indisputable.

I shall first indicate the chief localities of Ursine remains in this country,

and then enter upon the question of their specific characters and relations.
   The tusk of a bear, equalling in size that of the Ursus spel&its, has been dis-

covered in the celebrated hyaena-cave at Kirkdale in Yorkshire. The soli-

tary character of this specimen is made more remarkable by the fact of the

incalculable numbers of hyaenas' teeth which have been discovered in the
same cavern. The size of the Ursus spelaus must be regarded as one of its

striking and remarkable characters, but if this character were not associated

with modifications of the osseous and dental structures, it might only indi-

cate that the brown bear of Europe was a degenerate descendant of the same

species, as M. de Blainville has recently endeavoured to show. The diffi-

culties which oppose themselves to the view of the specific identity of the

great cave bear and the existing European bears, I shall point out after

noticing other localities in which the Ursus speleeus of Cuvier have been

found in this country.

In the cave at Paviland, in the lofty limestone cliff facing the sea on the

coast of Glamorganshire, the following parts of a large species of bear are

--enumerated by Dr. Buckland : Many molar teeth, two canines ; the sym-

physial end of two lower jaws, exhibiting the sockets of the incisor teeth

and of the canines ; the latter are more than three inches deep ; a humerus
nearly entire ; many vertebrae, two ossa calcis; metacarpal and metatarsal

bones.

At Oreston, on the coast of Devonshire, several caverns or cavernous fis-

sures were discovered during the quarrying of the limestone rock for the

construction of the breakwater at Plymouth. The first of these, described

in the Philosophical Transactions for 1817, contained the bones of a species
of Rhinoceros ; in the second, a smaller cavern distant one hundred and
twenty yards from the former, and described in the Philosophical Transac-

tions for 1821, were found, associated with the tooth of a rhinoceros and

parts of a deer, some teeth and bones of a large species of Ursus.

The fossils referable to the bear here discovered, include a canine tooth,

left side, lower jaw ; a canine tooth, left side, upper jaw ; the penultimate
grinder, right side, upper jaw; the penultimate grinder, left side, lower jaw;

a portion of the sacrum                                                                                     portions  of two  tibiae ;  a  portion  of the ulna ;  a

The richest cave-depository of the fossil bones of bears hitherto found in

England is that called Kent's Hole, near Torquay. The natural history, with

a special account of the organic riches of this cave, will be given in the se-

cond volume of the ' Reliquiae Diluvianae,' which Dr. Buckland is now pre-
paring for the press. It is to the assiduous researches of the late Rev. Mr.

Mac Enery that the discovery of the various and interesting fossils of this

cave is principally due, and some of the rarest and most valuable of this
gentleman's collection have been lately acquired by the British Museum.

Among the Ursine fossils meriting especial notice, are portions of the skull

and teeth of the Ursus spekeus, some of the latter equalling in size the

largest specimens from the German caverns.

The anterior portion of a lower jaw, includiug the anchylosed symphysis,

with two enormous canines, is likewise remarkable from the circumstance of

its retaining a small and simple-fanged premolar in the interspace or dia-

stema between the canines and the double-fanged molars.

  A second interesting fossil is a large proportion of the lower jaw, in-

cluding the symphysis and the whole dental series of each ramus ; the sockets
of two small simple-fanged premolars are visible in the diastema above de-
scribed ; one close to the canine, the other, less completely preserved, near

the first double-fanged molar.

   Amongst the bones of the trunk and extremities there occur remarkable

examples of diseased action ; a lumbar vertebra, for example, presents ex-
tensive exostosis from the under part and sides of the body ; the distal
extremity of the radius exhibits an oblique fracture of that bone, in the

attempt to heal which a new and irregular ossific mass has been deposited
on the surface of the bone. Several bones and teeth of the Bear from
Kent's Hole exhibit very decided marks of having been gnawed, most pro-
bably by a hyaena. One of the fragments of the lower jaw of a young Bear

shows the same interesting transitional state of dentition as has been dis-
covered in fossils from the continental bear-caves.

    The drift or diluvial deposits in several localities of England have yielded
remains of large carnivorous quadrupeds, and among these of the Bear.

    In the valley of the Thames this deposit affords considerable quantities of
brick-earth, and in working this material at Grays in Essex, and also at
Whitstable, remains of a large species of L'rsus have been discovered.

   An entire skull and portions of the upper and lower jaws of a bear have

been discovered in Manea Fen, Cambridgeshire, five feet below the surface.
The skull forms part of the collection of Piofessor Sedgwick : the portions
of the jaws are in the possession of Sir P. de M. Grey Egerton, Bart.

    These, though belonging to a genus extinct in Great Britain, can scarcely
be considered as fossil bones, and they are included in the present report,
rather as satisfactory objects of comparison with the remains of Bears from
the caverns and drift formations.

   I proceed now to inquire into the relations which the Bears, formerly inha-
bitants of this island, have to the existing species in Europe or other parts

--of the world ; an inquiry which the recent doubts pubbshed by If. de

Blainville as to the real nature of the specific differences pointed out by
Cuvier between the Cave Bears (L'rsus spelceus, U. priseus, Sec.) and the
existing species render more necessary.

    For this purpose I have critically compared most of our British fossils with
specimens from the German caverns, in the museums of this country, and
with the skeletons of the largest existing species, as the Vrsusferox, L. ma-

ritimus, arctos. See.

  --Cranium. John Hunter, who first instituted an anatomical comparison

between the Cave Bears and those of the present period, selected the great
Polar Bear for this purpose, as being the largest existing species with which
he was acquainted. Hunter, however, restricts himself to pointing out the
difference in the proportion of length to breadth in the skull of an old White
Bear and in that of the great Cave Bear : the individual skulls which he

compared are still preserved in juxtaposition in the Museum of the College
of Surgeons, as they were left by Hunter when removed by death from this

the latest field of his extensive and various researches.
    This difference in the proportions of the skull, though one of the most

striking between the fossil and recent species of Bears, is not the only one.
The last molar tooth of the upper jaw in the White Bear has a smaller an-
teroposterior diameter, and a narrower posterior termination. The inter-
space between the antepenultimate molar and the canine tooth presents the
remains of two sockets, one near the molar, the other near the canine, which
in young full-grown Polar Bears contain small and simple-fanged premolars.
The youngest specimens of Cave Bear which I have seen, exhibit no trace of
either of these small premolars, or of their sockets : they doubtless existed
in the foetus, but normally were very soon lost ; the exceptions are extremely
few in which their traces are visible in the jaws of full-grown Cave Bears.
The posterior palatal foramina are situated opposite the middle of the last
molar tooth in all the skulls of the White Bear examined by me, but oppo-
site the interspace between the penultimate and last molars in the skulls of
the Cave Bear. The zygomatic arches are wider and shorter, and the base
of the zygomatic process behind the glenoid cavity is more horizontal in

--the White Bear than in the Cave Bear. The Grisly Bear (Ursus ferox),
--larger species than the White Bear, and unknown to Hunter, agrees with

the Cave Bear in the great proportional size of the last molar tooth, but the
interspace between the antepenultimate grinder and the canine is relatively
                                    --

less than in either the Cave Bear ( U. spelceus) or White Bear ( U. maritimus),
and it contains two small and simple premolars in specimens, which from
the worn state of the molar teeth have belonged to older individuals than
those to which the skulls of the Cave Bear have belonged, which present no

trace of premolars.

    The lower jaw of the Ursus spelceus differs from that of the Ursus ferox
in the greater breadth of the posterior molar as compared with its length,
and in the greater convexity of the inferior contour of the ramus of the
jaw, in which latter circumstance it differs, though in a somewhat less degree,

from the Black Bear of Europe ( Ursus arctos).
   The lower jaw of the Grisly Bear, in differing by the larger size of its

molar teeth, especially of the last molar from the Polar Bear, in the same

degree differs less from the Ursus spelceus.
   The Ursine remains from the Paviland Cavern, and some of those from

Kent's Hole, are unquestionably identical with the Ursus spelceus.

   To this species, also, I should refer, on account of the size of the canines

and the extent of the diastema between these and the large molars, the
anterior part of the lower jaw from Kent's Hole ; notwithstanding the presence
of a small simple-fanged premolar in that diastema : since a few exceptional
instances have occurred of the persistence of these teeth in lower jaws of
the Ursus spelceus from the German and Belgian caverns.

   The fossil humerus from Kent's Hole likewise manifests all the characters
of that of the Ursus spelceus ; characters which appear to me to be as well

marked as those which can be pointed out as distinguishing the same bones

in any other two species of one genus.
   Cuvier, as is well known, conceived that he had met with two very distinct

forms of the humerus, belonging to equally gigantic extinct species of Cave

Bears.

   " On trouve deux sortes d'humerus, tous deux appartenant a des ours, et

cependant fort differens l'un de l'autre, John Hunter les a deja represented

(Phil. Trans. 1794, pi. xx.) ; mais depuis on n'a insiste dans aucun ouvrage

   Whatever may be deemed the value of the character of the perforation of
the inner condyle, I can affirm that it derives no accession from the other

differences manifested by the figure in Hunter's memoir, which Cuvier sup-
posed to be of a fossil Bear ; that figure having been, in fact, taken from the
humerus of an old Polar Bear, inserted in the plate (pi. xx. Phil. Trans.
1794.), and placed above the figure of the fossil humerus in order to illus-
trate the differences between the recent and fossil species. The bone of the
Polar Bear was placed by Hunter in the same drawer with two humeri of the
Cave Bear from Gailenreuth, which it exceeds in size, and which are the
identical specimens alluded to in the following passage of Hunter's Memoir:
" These are two ossa humeri rather of less size than those of the recent White
Bear." Hunter does not allude to any other differences, probably intending
these to be illustrated by the figures. These, in fact, show that the humerus
of the White Bear is broader at both extremities, and thicker in proportion to
its length. The supinator ridge forms an angle instead of being continued
downwards in a gentle convex curve ; the internal condyle is much thicker

and stronger, where it bounds the olecranal cavity, and it extends inwards to
a greater distance from the articular surface ; the deltoidal ridge reaches
lower down in the White Bear ; the antero-posterior diameter of the proxi-
mal third part of the bone1 of the White Bear exceeds in a marked degree
that of the extinct species.

   The decease of Hunter took place before the printing of his observations
on the fossil cave-bones, and the individual to whom the task of superin-
tending the printing was entrusted, described both the figures of the humeri
in the Plate, as belonging to the fossil species. Cuvier, who did not perceive
the resemblance of the upper figure to the humerus of the White Bear, and
who therefore did not recognise the mistake, avails himself of it to illustrate
his opinions respecting the specific distinction of his Ursi spelceus et Arc-

toideus.

    Cuvier, in fact, possessed a humerus of one of the great Cave Bears, the
internal condyle of which was perforated, as in the feline tribe, whilst other
humeri were imperforate, and corresponded with the lower figure in Hunter's
plate. But the perforated fossil humerus figured by Cuvier differs from that
of the White Bear in the shorter deltoid ridge, the narrower proximal and
distal extremities, the convex outline of the supinator ridge, and the inferior
production of the inner condyle ; in short in all those characters by which the
imperforate fossil humerus has been shown above to differ from that of the
White Bear. Not any of the three fossil humeri in the Hunterian Collec-
tion have the perforation of the internal condyle ; and amongst the ex-
tremely numerous humeri that have since been obtained from the bone-
caves of Germany, not any have been found to present the perforation which
Cuvier regards as the specific character of this bone in the Ursus spelceus ; it
is most probably therefore, as Professor de Blainville conjectures, an acci-
dental anomaly. But the differential characters which both the imperforate
and perforate humeri of the great Cave Bear present, when compared with
those of any recent species, cannot be reconciled by the hypothesis that these
are merely degenerated descendants of the Ursus spelceus.

    The humerus from Kent's Hole presents all the characters of that of the

--Ursus spelceus above described.
    Ulna. The ulna of the Cave Bear ( Ursus spelceus), compared with one
of the same length from the Polar Bear, is less straight, being more convex

towards the radius ; is thicker, particularly at the anterior part of the shaft
the ridge on the outside of the distal end of the bone is more produced ; the
styloid process is more pointed ; and the concavity on the inner side of the
proximal articular surface is deeper.

    The ulna from Kent's Hole agrees with that of the Ursus spelceus from the
 German caves.

    The difference between the femur of the Ursuc spelceus and the femur of Ur-
 sus arctos or ferox, is analogous to that which has been pointed out in the hu-
 meri ; the femur of the Grisly Bear being broader in proportion to its length,
 especially at its two extremities : it is owing to this breadth that the lesser tro-
 chanter is thrown wholly to the posterior surface of the bone, the inner mar-
 gin being continued beyond it, whilst in the Cave Bear the lesser trochanter,
 though on the posterior surface of the bone, projects a little beyond the inner
 margin. At the distal end of the bone the tuberosity above the internal
 condyle, corresponding with that in the humerus, is larger and more promi-
 nent in the Grisly than in the Cave Bear ; the same difference in the position
 of the lesser trochanter is presented by the White Bear as compared with
 the Cave Bear, and the extremities of the bone are relatively broader.

     I have not been able to detect any other well-marked modification of form
                    ON BRITISH FOSSIL MAMMALIA.                                                                       67

in the remaining bones of the extremities of the Ursus spelams, but the co-
incidence of such appreciable modifications in the femur, ulna, humerus,
with those in the form and proportions of the head, and in the form and the
relative size of certain teeth, seem to offer as good grounds for the specific
distinction of the Ursus spclceus as for that of the Ursus maritimus, or any
other existing species proposed by Pallas and Cuvier, and admitted by the

best modern zoologists.
   The question which the Palaeontologist ought to propose to himself in his

first survey of the fossils of any particular district, is the value of the distinc-

tive characters which such remains may present, as compared with those
which distinguish species, according to the zoological systems and principles

of the time being. For if he disregard or suppress such differential cha-
racters in the fossils, because the limits of variation by the influence of time

and surrounding circumstances may not be determined, he rejects one of the
valuable means whereby the ultimate resolution of such higher and more
general questions in zoology may be effected.

   To refuse to recognise such differences as have been .pointed out in the
skeleton of the great Cave Bear, because they may be possibly or hypothe-
tically accounted for by degeneration of the specific type, and thereupon to

record the fossil species as the primaeval Ursus arctos, seems a voluntary-

abandonment of the most valuable instrument in all ulterior inquiries.
    Observation has well determined the extent of modification which the

skull of a carnivorous species may undergo according to age, to sex, to the

free or the constrained exercise of its destructive weapons ; and the relative
size of the intermuscular crests, the relative strength of the zygomatic arches
and the proportions of the canines to the other teeth are well known to vary

within certain limits.

   But in the Ursus speleeus we have to account for the greater relative size
and complexity of certain molar teeth ; for the more extended diastemata,
accompanying more lengthened jaws ; for a premature loss of certain teeth
and their sockets, without any predominating development of neighbouring
canines to account for it ; for narrower zygomata, with longer and higher
parietal crests ; for large frontal sinuses impressing a striking and readily

recognisable feature upon the skull.
    It has been endeavoured to explain the last-cited modification, by assert-

ing that the primasval Bears had their frontal sinuses more developed in
virtue of their respiring a fresher, drier, and more invigorating atmosphere
than their less fortunate and degenerated descendants*. But we may question
whether the flat-headed Ursus ferox has a less exposed locality or breathes
a more humid and impure atmosphere on the rocky mountains of North
America, than did the old Cave Bears of the German and British forests ;
and we may more than doubt that the cold and bracing sea-breezes inhaled
by the still flatter-headed Polar Bear, should be less efficient in expanding
the sinuses along the respiratory tract, than the musty air of the sepulchral

retreats in which the Cave Bears slept.
    Existing species of Bears, reckoned distinct by modern zoologists, do in

fact differ in the relative convexity of their forehead, and the flat-headed
species, as the Polar and American Bears, are unquestionably not those which
habitually respire the least pure and invigorating air. Instead of speculating

on the atmosphere as a physical cause of the inflation of the bony cells, it
would be more profitable, if it were possible, to trace the relationship between
the different degrees of development which the frontal sinuses may present in

Wedifferent species of Bears, and their peculiar habits and modes of life.

may thus, I think, see the reason why, in the piscivorous species of the Polar

ice, the receptacles of air in the bones of the head are least developed, viz.
to offer least resistance to its progress through the water when diving after

its prey.

    The opposite extreme in the condition of the frontal sinuses of the Ursus
spelceus, may have had some corresponding relation to the habits of that gi-

gantic extinct species.

   From the great proportional size and more complicated tubercular surface
of the posterior molar teeth, especially in the upper jaw, and from the
greater complication on the crown of the smallest persistent molar in the
lower jaw, one might be led to suppose that the Ursus spelceus fed more on
vegetables than the Grisly Bear does.

    If this were the case, one might infer from the slight traces of abrasion in
the teeth of full-grown specimens, that the vegetable food, in whatever pro-
portion it entered into their diet, was of a soft nature, as berries, or tender
twigs or sprouts. The size and strength of the Ursus spelceus would, how-
ever, enable it to cope with the large Ruminants and ordinary Pachyderms,
its contemporaries in ancient Britain and on the Continent, and to success-
fully defend itself against the large Lion or Tiger, whose remains have been
found in the same caverns.

    I proceed next to speak of other species of Ursus, of which the fossil re-
mains have been found in the caves and superficial deposits in this country.

  A large proportion of a lower jaw, with the incisors, canines, and the entire

series of molar teeth on both sides, from Kent's Hole, corresponds with the

jaw of the Ursus priscus, Goldfuss. The size is much inferior to that of the
Ursus spelceus ; while the worn surface of the teeth proves the animal to have

been mature, and probably aged.
    The socket of the first fangless small premolar is immediately behind the

canine, and a trace of the socket of a similar premolar is visible near the first
double-fanged molar. The interspace containing the simple sockets of the
two small premolars is relatively longer than in the Brown Bear or White
Bear. The last true molar is relatively smaller than in the Ursus spelceus.

   The Oreston Ursine fossils appear to me to be referable also to the Ursus

priscus.

   The most remarkable fossils of the Ursine family which have been found
in this country, are those of the Ursus cultridens, or at least of a species closely
allied to that from Auvergne and the Val d'Arno ; the singularly compressed
and serrated canines of which suggested to Cuvier the specific name above
quoted. The evidence of this species, since made the type of a distinct
sub-genus under the names of Machairodus and Stenodon, which British

localities have afforded, consists of detached canine teeth found in Kent's
Hole. These are larger and broader in proportion to their thickness, and
have shorter fangs than the Auvergne tooth figured in the ' Osteography '

of M. de Blainville.
   The crown of one of the canines of the Ursus cultridens, from Kent's Hole,

measures 2-g- inches ; the fang of a second canine, with the apex of the canine
worn down, is 2^ inches in length ; the breadth of the base of the crown is
1 inch 2 lines ; its thickness half an inch.

    The oldest fossil referable to the genus Ursus which I have yet seen, is the
crown of a molar tooth, found associated with remains of a large species of
ON BRITISH FOSSIL MAMMALIA.  69

Felis in the red crag, below the so-called mammaliferous crag near Wood-

bridge, Suffolk ; the Ursine fossil in question is the antepenultimate grinder
of the right side, upper jaw ; it is smaller than the corresponding tooth in the
 Ursus spelaus.

    The most recent remains of the Bear which can claim to be included in
the present Report, are those already mentioned, which have been disco-
vered about five feet below the surface in the Manea Fen, Cambridgeshire.

    Sir Philip Egerton possesses a fine example of the right superior maxillary
and intermaxillary bone of the Bear from this locality.

    The jaw nearly equals in size that of the Ursus spelceus, but differs in the
much shorter interspace between the canine and the third molar tooth, count-
ing from behind forwards ; likewise in having this interspace occupied by
two small and simple-fanged false molars. The crown of the penultimate

grinder is broader in proportion to its length or antero-posterior diameter.

The difference in regard to the presence of the two first false molars must be
allowed due weight, since the present Fen Bear has its grinders much worn,
whilst the Cave Bear, with which it is compared, is a younger but full-grown
specimen, with the tubercles of the grinding teeth entire, and the last molar
tooth of the Fen Bear has a narrower posterior termination than in the Cave
Bear. The Fen Bear differs also from the Ursus priscus, which retains the
two first false molars, by their being in contact, which results from the nar-
rower interspace between the canine and the third false molar, which inter-
space is relatively as wide in the Ursus priscus as in the Ursus spelceus ; and
a great proportion of this interspace divides the first from the second false

molar in the Ursus priscus. This likewise cannot be a difference dependent
on age or sex, for the jaw of the Fen Bear here described belonged to an
individual absolutely larger than the Ursus priscus, with which it is com-
pared ; and, judging from the size of the canine incisor teeth, the Fen Bear
was probably an old male. The grinding surface of the molars prove it to

have been a much older individual than the Ursus priscus with which it is
compared, and to have attained that age when no difference could be ex-

pected to take place in the length of the interspaces of any of the teeth. In
all the characters in which the upper jaw of the Fen Bear differs from that of
the two species of Cave Bear with which it has been compared, it agrees with
the Ursus arctos, especially the Black, or Norwegian variety.

   In the museum of Prof. Sedgwick at Cambridge there is an entire cranium
of the same species of Bear from the Manea Fen, which enables us to extend

the comparison of this ancient British species with those still existing in

Europe. In regard to which it may be observed that the cranium of the
Manea Fen Bear in its less convex forehead, and the length of the sagittal
crest, which commences at a greater distance, in front of the occiput, resembles
the black variety of Ursus arctos more than it does the Brown Bear.

   As it may serve to further elucidate the characters of the Cave Bears (Ursi

spelceus et priscus), as well as those of the Ursus arctos, of which I regard
the specimens under consideration to be a variety, I shall add a few observa-
tions arising out of the comparison of the lower jaw of the Fen Bear. The
specimen, which is in the collection of Sir Philip Egerton, consists of the left
ramus of the lower jaw, from Manea Fen, Cambridgeshire. It equals in
length the largest specimen of the lower jaw of the Ursus spelceus, but differs
from that species in the more simple form of the last spurious molar, or the
fourth grinder counting from behind forwards ; for, whereas the Cave Bear
has two distinct cusps developed upon that tooth, in the present species there
is only one cusp, as in the Black, Brown and White Bears. The Bear of the
Fen also differs from the Ursus spelceus in the shorter interspace between the
70 REPORT-- 1842.

last-described molar and the canine, even when compared with the lower jaw
of a Cave Bear absolutely shorter, The preceding interspace in the Fen Bear
contains the sockets of two small spurious molars, 'each with a simple fang,
but there is no trace of these in the Cave Bear, save in very rare excep-
tions ; and this difference cannot be the effect of age, because the lower jaw
of the Fen Bear, which has the grinders moderately worn by mastication, is
here compared with the jaw of a young and small Ursus spelceus, in which
the tubercles of the grinding teeth are all entire. The Fen Bear resembles

the Ursus prisons in so far as the latter retains the first false molar, but dif-
fers in possessing the second, which is wanting in a younger specimen of the
Ursus priscus ; it differs also in the greater extent of the interspace between
the canine and the third false molar ; and, more importantly, in the form of
that tooth, which in the Ursus priscus presents a second cusp on the inner
side, and a little behind the first, which is wholly wanting in the Fen Bear.

The ramus of the jaw is deeper, and the slope of the symphysis is more gra-
dual. In all the particulars in which the Fen Bear differs from the two ex-
tinct species above cited, from the caverns, it agrees with the existing Black
Bears of Europe, from which it does not appear to differ in any well-marked
specific character. The Grisly Bear of North America agrees with the Cave
Bear in the absence of the first two false molars and in the more complicated
crown of the third false molar of the lower jaw.

                                              Subgenus Meles.

    Fossil remains of the Badger {Meles vulgaris) have not been discovered in
British strata more ancient than the diluvium. They offer no characters
distinguishable from those of the existing species : the comparison support-
ing this conclusion has been made on the right branch of the lower jaw, with
the entire series of teeth, of the fossil Badger, from Kent's Hole, Torquay.

    Remains of the Badger have been found fossil in the cave at Berry Head,
Devon.

                                             Genus Putorius.

    Remains of a species of Weasel, not to be distinguished from the bones of
 the Putorius vulgaris, have been obtained from the bone-cave at Kirkdale,
 and from Kent's Hole, near Torquay. The collection of the late Mr.

 Mac Enery contained a nearly entire skull, having all the characters of that
 of the common Weasel, but evidently a contemporary with the Cave Bears
 and Hyaenas, now extinct.

     Remains of a somewhat larger species of Putorius, probably Put. Ermi-
 neus, have been discovered in the bone-cave at Berry Head.

   A cranium stained red and absorbent from the loss of animal matter, of

 the size and conformation of that of the Putorius Euro, was obtained, with
 other fossils, from one of the raised beaches at Plymouth.

                                               Genus Canis.

     Amongst the fossils referable to the Wolf ( Canis lupus) which have been
 discovered, associated with those of the Hyaena and Bear in most of the

 bone-caves of England, as at Kirkdale, at Paviland, at Oreston, in Kent's
 Hole, in the Mendip caverns, &c, the most remarkable is an almost entire
 skull, discovered in Kent's Hole. This does not exceed in size the skull of a
 fine male Arctic Wolf, but the penultimate molar is a little larger, and the
 lower border of the jaw rather more convex.

     Remains of a smaller species of Canis, not distinguishable from those of
 the Fox (Canis vulpes), have been found in Kirkdale (a calcaneuui and

 many teeth) ; at Oveston (teeth and bones of the extremities) ; and in Kent's
 Hole (an entire left ramus of the lower jaw, with other less perfect and in-

 structive specimens).

                                              Genus Hycena.

     In regard to the extinct British species of the genus Hycena, little remains
to be added to the accurate and graphic history of these Ossivora contained
in the ' Reliquiae Diluvianae ' of Dr. Buckland.

    Besides the cave at Kirkland, in which the abundance of Hyaenas' teeth
and bones is so extraordinary, the remains of the same species of Hyaena
have been found in the caverns at Oreston, at Paviland, at Kent's Hole, and
in the Mendips.

    The ancient British Hyaena resembles more closely the Hycena crocuta of
South Africa than the Hycena vulgaris of North Africa and Asia Minor : it
differs however from the Cape Hyaena in the smaller interspace between the
occipital condyle and the mastoid process ; and in the greater relative depth

of the posterior plate of the glenoid cavity for the lower jaw. In the spotted
Hyaena the anterior and internal tubercle of the penultimate molar (upper
jaw) is relatively larger, and the small posterior molar is a little further

removed from the penultimate one. The posterior ridge of the second molar
tooth of the lower jaw is relatively broader in the fossil than in the recent
Hyaena ; the first molar lower jaw is also relatively larger, especially in its pos-
terior division, and it is nearer the canine in the fossil Hyaena. The numbers
of the Hycena spelcea in England may be conceived, when the remains*of not
fewer than from 200 to 300 have been discovered in a single cavern, as that
at Kirby Moorside.

    Fossil Hyaenas have been shown by Dr. Buckland to be found in this
country, as on the Continent, in situations of two kinds, viz. caverns and drift,
or the so-called diluvial gravel. In the latter formation they were first dis-
covered in England in the year 1 822, at Lawford near Rugby, associated
with bones of the Mammoth, Rhinoceros, Equus, Bos, &c. The integrity of
the Hyaena's under-jaw from this locality presents a remarkable contrast
with the uniformly fractured condition of the bones from the caverns, and the
explanation of, and deductions from, this difference, given by the author of
the ' Reliquiae Diluvianae,' are replete with interest.

                                              Genus Felis.

   The remains of a feline animal surpassing in size the largest existing
Lion or Tiger, have been found in the bone-caves of the Mendip Hills, in
those at Oreston, at Kirby Moorside, and in Kent's Hole. Of this remarkable
species, to which the name of Felis spelcea has been given, most of the cha-
racteristic bones have been discovered in the caves at Gailenreuth, proving
its true feline structure and its large relative size.

   The metacarpal bone of a large Felis from the Hyaena-cave at Kirby Moor-
side does not exceed in size the corresponding bones of the Tiger : it might
have belonged to a young individual of the Felis spelcea. In a collection of
fossil teeth from the red crag of Newbourne near Woodbridge, the genus
Felis is represented by a posterior molar, belonging to the left side of the
lower jaw of a species equal in size to the Leopard. This tooth presented
the same mineral condition, and had been subject to the same mechanical
attrition as the fossil teeth of an extinct Shark (Carcharias megalodoti) found

along with it.

   The lower jaw of a species of Felis about the size of the Wild Cat (Felis
catus) has been found in Kent's Hole.
--72 REPORT 1842.

                 Genus Lutra.

   Of this genus I have determined characteristic remains of a species about
the size of the common Otter, in the so-called mammaliferous crag at South-

wold, and near Aldeburg, Suffolk.

                 Order Cetacea.

   Most of the remains of this order of Mammalia, have been, in Great Britain
found in gravel-beds adjacent to estuaries or large rivers, in marine drift or

diluvium, and in" the subjacent clay-beds : but although these depositories are

the most superficial, and belong to the most recent period in geology, the

situation of the cetaceous fossils generally indicate a gain of dry land from

the sea. Thus the skeleton of a Balsenoptera, 72 feet in length, found im-

bedded in clay on the banks of the Forth, Mas more than twenty feet above

the reach of the highest tide. Several bones of a whale, discovered at Du-

more Rock, Stirlingshire, in brick-earth, were nearly forty feet above the

present level of the sea. The vertebrae of a whale, discovered by Mr. Richard-

son in the yellow marl or brick-earth of Heme Bay, in Kent, were situated

Aten feet above the occasional reach of the sea on that coast.  large verte-

bra of Balccna mysticelus was discovered fifteen feet below the surface, in

gravel, by the workmen employed in digging the foundation for the new

Temple Church. The teeth of a Cachalot have been discovered by Mr. Brown

in the diluvium of Essex. Part of the tusk of a Narwhal (Alonodon) has

been discovered in the London clay presenting the usual condition of the
                                                                                                                                                               ;

fossils*from that old tertiary stratum.

The most completely petrified remains of this order are a series of anchy-

losed cervical vertebra? of a large Delphinns in the museum of Prof. Sedg-

wick. Their fossilized condition indicates a higher antiquity than the Ceta-

cean fossils above noticed : they were discovered in Cambridgeshire, but the
stratum and locality were unfortunately unknown.

   No specimens of herbivorous Cetacea have hitherto been discovered in

British strata.

                 Order Rodentia.

   The British fossil remains of species of this order hitherto detected are

referable to the genera Castor (Beaver), Arvicola (Water-vole, Field-vole),
Mils (Rat and Mouse), and Lepus (Hare and Rabbit); which have been
found in superficial drift, bogs and fens, (Castor), in bone-caves, in the
brick-earth deposits, in the mammaliferous crag, and in the subjacent red

crag. The ancient Rodents from the last two tertiary formations belong to
the genus Arvicola. The fossils of the Beaver above noticed agree with the
species of the Danube. Besides these, the remains of the great Castor Tro-
gontherium have been found in the submarine forest at Bacton.

                                       Order Marsupialia.

                                           Genus Didefphi/s ?

   In the eocene sand, underlying the London clay, at Kyson near Wood-

bridge, Sussex, a small portion of jaw, with a spurious molar tooth, has been
found. This fossil has been referred to the Opossum (Diddphys), but the

evidence which it afforded is, in my opinion, insufficient to support that con-

clusion. There is no tooth so little characteristic, or upon which a deter-
mination of the genus could be less safely founded, than one of the spurious
molars of the smaller carnivorous and omnivorous Ferce and Marsupialia.

A large, laterally compressed, sharp-pointed middle cone or cusp with a small

posterior, and sometimes also a small anterior talon, more or less distinctly de-
veloped, is the form common to these teeth in many of the genera of the above
                                                                        :

orders. It is on this account, and because the tooth of the fossil in question
differs in the shape of the middle and size of the accessory cusps from that

of any known species of Didelphys, that I regard its reference to that genus
as premature, and the affinities of the species to which it belongs as needing
further evidence before they can be determined beyond the reach of doubt.

Mr. Charlesworth, by whom the present fossil was first described and figured,

has accurately specified the differences above alluded to in the shape of the
crown of the tooth as compared with the false molars of the true Opossums

they are seen in the more equilateral or symmetrical shape of the middle
cusp, the greater development of the posterior talon, and the presence of
the anterior talon at the base of the middle cusp : the grounds on which his

determination of the fossil was founded are not stated.

The crowns of the spurious molars of the placental Ferae, which present the

same general form as the fossil, are thicker from side to side in proportion to

their breadth ; the spurious molars of the Dasyurus, Thylacinus, and Pkas-

cogale, differ in like manner from the fossil. It is in the marsupial genera

Didelphys and Perameles that the false molars present the same laterally

Nowcompressed shape as in the fossil.  besides the perfect tooth, the fossil

includes the empty sockets of two other teeth ; and the relative position of

these sockets places the Perameles out of the pale of comparison. On the

hypothesis that the present fossil represents a species of Didelphys, the tooth

in situ unquestionably corresponds with the second or middle false molar,

right side, lower jaw. This is proved by the size and position of the an-

terior alveolus.

   Had the tooth in situ been the one immediately preceding the true molars,

the socket anterior to it should have been at least of equal size and in juxta-
position to the one containing the tooth. The anterior socket, however, is

little more than half the size of the one in which the tooth is lodged ; it is
also separated from that socket by an interspace equal to that which separates

the first from the second false molar in the Didelphys Virginiana. This is

well shown in the inside view. In the placental Mammalia, in which the first

small false molar is similarly separated by a diastema from the second, the
first false molar has only a single fang. In the present fossil, the empty

socket of the first false molar proves that the tooth had two fangs, as in the

marsupial Perce and Insectivora. There is nothing in the size or form of the

socket, posterior to the implanted tooth of the fossil, to forbid the supposition

that it contained a false molar, resembling the one in place ; had it been the
socket of a true molar, then the fossil could not have belonged to Didelphys,
or to any other known marsupial genus, because no known marsupial animal,

which presents the posterior false molar of a similar form and in like juxta-

position with the true molars as the tooth in the present fossil (on the sup-

position that it immediately preceded the true molars), has the next false

molar so small as it must have been in the fossil on that supposition.

   Upon the whole, the conclusion that the present eocene tertiary fossil is
marsupial is the most probable one, but the evidence is insufficient to demon-
strate its truth. Cuvier, however, might have failed to convince contem-
porary naturalists that the corresponding formation in France contained the

remains of a Didelphys, unless he had had the good fortune to demonstrate

the marsupial bones in their natural connections with the pelvis.

                                      Genus Phascolotherium.

   With regard to the fossil on which the genus Phascolotherium is founded,

the maxillary evidence is more complete. Two rami of lower jaws, one con-

taining the whole dental series, have been discovered in the oolitic slate at
74 REPORT-- 1842.

Stonesfiekl, associated with the Amphitherium described in a preceding sec-
tion of the Report.

    In the Geological Transactions, vol. vi., second series, p. 58, will be found
the description and figures of the most complete of these fossils, and the ob-
servations in proof of the marsupial affinities of the Phascolotfierium. It has

--four true molars, and three, or, at most, four false molars one canine and

three incisors in each ramus of the lower jaw. In the proportionate size of
the molars, especially the small size of the hindmost tooth, the Phascolothc-
rium resembles the Myrmecobius more than the Opossum or Dasyure, but it
more resembles the Thylacim in the shape of the grinding teeth. It likewise
agrees with the Thi/lacine in the low position of the condyle, and in the lon-
gitudinal extent of the inwardly inflected angle of the jaw. The close ap-
proximation of the Phascolotherium to marsupial genera, now confined to

New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, leads us to reflect upon the in-

teresting correspondence between other organic remains of the British oolite
and the existing forms now confined to the Australian continent and neigh-
bouring seas. Here, for example, the Cestracion swims which has given the

key to the nature of the " palates " from the oolite, now known as teeth of
congeneric gigantic forms of cartilaginous fishes. Living Trigonice and Te-
rebratulce abound in the Australian seas, and afford food to the Cestracion,
as their extinct analogues probably did to the Aciodi, Psammodi, &c. of the
oolitic period. Araucariae and cycadeous plants flourish on the Australian
continent, where marsupial quadrupeds abound, and thus appear to complete
a picture of an ancient condition of the earth's surface, which has been su-
perseded in our hemisphere by other strata and a higher type of mam-

miferous organization.

Addendum to Report on British Fossil Mammalia, Part I.

Since the printing of the first part of the above Report, I have, in the course

of an investigation of the mammalian fossils of Essex and Norfolk, examined

the skeleton " combining a dentition like that of the ruminants, with, appa-

rently, a divided metacarpus and metatarsus," and alluded to at p. 57, in re-

ference to the stratum containing the remains of a mole.

The bones placed in the position of the metacarpus and metatarsus, and

so described in Mr. Green's work*, do not belong to the same animal as the

jaws and the rest of the skeleton : one of the so-called metatarsals is the tibia

of a quadruped about the size of a hare, the other is a shorter bone, with a

wide medullary cavity, like the shall of a femur. The two metacarpals are

the un-united divisions of the metatarsal, or cannon-bone, of a very young

Aor foetal ruminant.  portion of the vertebra dentata, and the distal epiphy-

sis of the right radius of the animal to which the chief part of the skeleton

belongs, are placed in the position of the tarsal bones ; the distal end of the

right femur is placed above the tarsus as the distal end of the left tibia : in

short, the parts of the skeleton in question have been artificially and arbi-

trarily fixed in the position in Avhich they are represented in the plate in Mr.

Green's work, and in the drawing originally submitted to me.

The portion of the skull, jaws and teeth, vertebrae, pelvis, scapula, hume-

rus, radius and ulna, femur and tibia, are parts of the same individual, which

is a ruminant closely resembling the Roe-deer (Cervics capreolus), probably

female, arrived at full size, as the dentition proves, but immature, as the state

of the epiphyses shows. The bones have lost much of their animal matter,

and are of a brown colour.

        ON THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT ON SEEDS AND PLANTS. 75

Researches on the Influence of Light on the Germination of Seeds

  and the Growth of Plants. By Mr. Robert Hunt, Secretary to

   the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society.

The British Association having committed to my care this interesting in-

quiry, to which I had the satisfaction of first drawing attention, I feel it is

incumbent on me to furnish to the present meeting some account of the
results of my researches, as far as I have proceeded with them. I wish it

to be particularly understood, that this communication does not pretend to
contain anything, which can fairly be looked upon as pointing to any defi-
nite laws, or which can support any theoretical view of the influence of

solar light on vegetation. As it was not possible to commence my ob-

servations, in series, until January, the short time which has elapsed has not

permitted of my varying the conditions under which my experiments have
been tried. Had I been enabled to do so, I should in all probability have
had it in my power to explain with some approach to correctness, the causes

which have operated in the production of some of the effects described, but

on which I am scarcely enabled to speculate in the present state of the in-

quiry. I simply record the facts as they stand, trusting they will prove the
singular importance of the subject, which promises to lead us to a clear

view of many of the most mysterious functions of plants, to explain some of
the most interesting phasnomena of vegetable life, and beyond this, to deve-

lope properties in light which have not yet been discovered.

    Before I proceed to the principal subject of this paper, it is necessary I
should particularly describe the arrangements with which I have operated.

    Six boxes have been so prepared, that air was freely admitted to the plants
within them, without permitting the passage of any light, except that which
passed through the coloured glasses with which they were covered.

    These glasses permitted the permeation of the rays of light in the follow-
ing order.

   A1. Ruby Glass, coloured ivith Oxide of Gold This glass permits the

permeation of the ordinary red, and the extreme red rays only.

  --2. A Brown Red Glass. The extreme red ray appears shortened ; the

ordinary red ray, and the orange ray pass freely, above which the spectrum
is sharply cut off.

 --3. Orange Glass. The spectrum is shortened by the cutting off of the

violet, indigo, and a considerable portion of the blue rays. The green ray is
nearly absorbed in the yellow, which is considerably elongated. The whole

of the least refrangible portion of the spectrum permeates this glass freely.

  --4. Yellow Glass, somewhat Opalescent. This glass shortens the spec-

trum by cutting off the extreme red ray, and the whole of the most refran-

--gible rays beyond the blue ray.
   5. Cobalt Blue Glass. The spectrum obtained under this glass is
perfect from the extreme limits of the most refrangible rays down to the
yellow, which is wanting. The green ray is diminished, forming merely a
well-defined line between the blue and the yellow rays. The orange and

red rays are partially interrupted.

 --6. Deep Green Glass. The spectrum is cut off below the orange and

above the blue rays. Although the space on which the most luminous por-
tion of the spectrum falls appears as large as when it is not subjected to the
absorptive influence of the glass, there is a great deficiency of light, and on
close examination with a powerful lens, a dark line is seen to occupy the
ss pace usually marked by the green ray.

        l

  A case has also been prepared containing five flat vessels filled with dif-

ferent coloured fluids. Much delay has been occasioned in the observations

with these, owing to the difficulty of securing the contents in the glass cells
from leakage and evaporation ; the sun, the alkalies, and the acids acting on
the cements used to secure them. At length I have procured some very flat
flint glass bottles, which answer extremely well ; in these the fluids are about
an inch thick, and observe the following order in their absorptive actions :

  --A. Red. Solution of Carmine in Supersulphate of Ammonia. This gives

a spectrum nearly in all respects similar to that given by the ruby glass (1) ;
all the rays above a line drawn through the centre of the space occupied by
the orange being cut off.

  A --B. Yellow. saturated Solution of Bichromate ofPotash. This beauti-

fully transparent solution admits the permeation of the red and yellow rays,
which are extended over the space occupied by the orange ray in the unab-
sorbcd spectrum. The green rays are scarcely evident.

   From the absorptive powers of the sulphurets of lime and potash in solu-
tion, I was very desirous of using them, but they were found to be so liable
to decomposition when exposed to the sun's rays as to be quite useless for
my purposes, sulphuretted hydrogen being liberated in such quantities as

to burst the bottles with great violence.

  --C. Gbeen. Muriate of Iron and Copper. This medium is remarkably

transparent ; the blue, green, yellow and orange rays pass freely, all the

--others being absorbed.
   D. Blue. Cupro-sulphate of Ammonia. This fluid obliterates all the rays
below the green ray, those above it permeating it freely.

 --E. White. This is merely water rendered acid by nitric acid, for the

purpose of securing its continued transparency. It should be noted that
spaces in the cases have been left open to the full influence of the light, that

a fair comparison might be made between those plants growing under ordi-
nary circumstances, and the others under the dissevered rays.

   It will be seen from the above that the following combinations of rays
have been obtained to operate with.

   1 and A. The calorific rays, so called, well-insulated.

  A2. smaller portion of these rays mixed with a small amount of those

having peculiar illuminating powers.
   3. The central portion of the solar spectrum well-defined, and all the rays

of least refrangibility, thus combining the luminous and calorific rays, so

called.

   4-. The luminous rays mixed with a small portion of those having a calo-

rific influence.

   5. The most refrangible rays with a considerable portion of the least so
thus combining the two extremes of chemical action, and affording a good
example of the influence of the calorific blended with the chemical spectrum.

   6. Some portion of those rays having much illuminating power, with those
in which the chemical influence is the weakest under ordinary circumstances.
[Some information given me with great kindness by Sir John Herschel

shows that this is not a correct expression of the, case, as he has discovered
some preparations on which these rays act with the greatest intensity.]

   B. The luminous rays in a tolerably unmixed state.
   C. The luminous rays combined with the least actively chemical ones, as
in 6 ; but in this case the luminous rays exert their whole influence.
   D. The most refraugible or chemical rays well-insulated.
   E. White light.
    Although I have adopted the terms usually employed to designate the
divisions of the spectrum, yet it is necessary to bear in mind that these terms

material upon which it is made to act.                                     .

.

   planted in pots, and placed in boxes under the glasses 1, 2, J, 4, b, b.
78 REPORT-- 1842.

   The first appearance of germination took place with the tulips under the

orange glass (!3), which was followed in three days by those under the red
glass (2), then by those under the ruby glass (1), and next by those under
the influence of the yellow (4), blue (5), and green glasses (6). The roots
under the orange glass developed the cotyledons a week earlier than those

under the yellow, blue, and green glasses. But that the ranunculuses ob-

served the same relative order in germinating, I should have suspected that

some peculiarity in the bulbs had influenced the result, although these had
been selected with the most scrupulous care, At first the greatest pro-

gress was made by the tulips under the yellow (4) and orange glasses (3) ;
but the leaves under eacli of these were by no means healthy, particularly

under the yellow glass (4), which had a singularly delicate appearance, being
of a very light green, and covered with a most delicate white bloom.

   The leaf-stalks of the tulips shot up remarkably long, and were in both

cases white ; at length an exceedingly small flower-bud appeared on the

plant under the orange glass (3), which perished almost as soon as it ap-
peared, and the death of the plant immediately followed. The tulips under

the yellow glass (4) never showed any buds, and their vitality soon failed
them. The condition of the ranunculuses was in most respects similar to
that of the tulips ; they exhibited the same exuberant length of stalk
but the leaves were of a more healthful appearance. These plants, however,
never showed any flower-buds, and they died nearly about the same time

with the tulips.

It may be proper to mention that the garden-pots in which these roots

were planted, were filled with a mixture of fine earth, sand, and well-rotted

Amanure from a hot-bed.  few days after their exposure, those under the

orange and yellow glasses threw up several fungi, and continued for some

days to do so, which was not the case with any of the others.
   Under the ruby (1 ) and red glasses (2), the tulips shot up a single lobe,

which maintained a little life for three or four weeks, but never rose more
than two inches above the soil. There was a marked redness upon this
stunted formation, which I often fancied was in some respects characteristic
of the kind of medium under which they were placed. The tuberous roots
perished in the soil ; sufficient moisture and warmth had called into action
the latent principle of germination, but being unable to maintain it against

the destructive influence of the light, they rotted.

   Beneath the green glass (6) the plants grew all of them, slowly but tole-
rably strong. They were, however, marked by a more extraordinary length
of stem than those before mentioned ; some of the stems of the ranunculuses
being above ten inches in length, having a small leaf at the end not more
than two-thirds of an inch in diameter. These plants all show flower-buds, but
none of them could be made to flower, notwithstanding the greatest care
and attention was bestowed upon them ; the effort of throwing up the buds
appeared to exhaust their powers, and the whole of these plants soon died.

   The results under the blue glass (5) were very different ; the roots germi-
nated, I think, a little less quickly than they did in the open ground, forming
compact and healthy plants, developing their flower-buds strongly. Most un-
fortunately the wind on a tempestuous night overturned this box and scat-

tered its contents, preventing of course the formation of the perfect flowers,
which but for this accident there can be no doubt would have ensued.

   Numerous experiments have been tried with the seeds of mignonette,
many varieties of the flowering pea, the common parsley, and cresses ; with
all of them the results have been similar to those already described. The

seeds have germinated, in general, the most rapidly under the red glass (2),
       ON THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT ON SEEDS AND PLANTS. 79

and next under the ruby, blue, and orange glasses (1, 3, and 5). Except
under the blue glass, these plants have all been marked by the extraordinary
length to which the stems of the cotyledons have grown, and the entire abs-

ence of the plumula. No true leaves forming, the cotyledons soon perish,

and the plant dies. Under the green glass (6) the process of germination
has been exceedingly slow, and the plants, particularly the cresses and

mignonette, have speedily died.
    Under the blue glass (5) alone has the process gone on healthfully to the

end, and although 1 have found a few instances of a perfect plant under the
yellow glass (4), it has not on any occasion yet endured to the formation of
a flower ; excepting the plants under the yellow and blue glasses (4- and 5),
all have been more or less etiolated.

   The most remarkable phsenomenon remains to be noticed ; under all ordi-
nary circumstances plants bepd towards the light, whereas those growing
under the red glass (2) have invariably bentfrom it.

    The experiments with the light analysed by the fluid media, have been in
every respect confirmatory of the results I originally obtained, which were
published more than two years since in the Philosophical Magazine. Ger-
mination has been in nearly all cases prevented by the absorptive powers of
yellow and red fluids (A and B). I say in nearly all cases, as I have within
the last few weeks, since the sun has shone with more than usual fervour,
noticed a few symptoms of weak germination under the yellow fluid (B).
It will be seen by reference to my paper above referred to, that I suspected
the difference in the results obtained by Professor Draper and myself, arose
from some peculiar difference between the condition of the rays of the sun
in Virginia and in England. The above fact confirms me in this opinion.
The absorptive powers of the atmosphere I have no doubt are constantly
changing, not merely with regard to its influence on the solar beam, but va-
rying as it regards particular rays ; and I think it will be found that the

 condition of the prismatic spectrum is not on all occasions the same. I be-

lieve Sir David Brewster has proved this to be the case ; I am not, however,

 acquainted with the facts.

    Under the green medium (C) the cotyledons only have been formed, and

 these have all been etiolated.

   A very large wooden case was perforated with four small holes, two within

 a few inches of each other, on either side of the front of the box, one pair being
 about three feet from the other. These holes were covered with coloured
glasses, red (2), yellow (3), blue (5), green (6) ; thus arranged it was turned
 over on the ground, several potatoes having been planted close to the back
of the box, at the greatest possible distance from the holes through which
 alone light was admitted.

    The red and yellow glasses were at one end, and the blue and green at

 the other.

    After some weeks, when examined, it was found that the shoots from the
 potatoes, and the weeds which had sprung up from the ground, had, all of
 them, in the most marked manner, run towards the yellow glass, through
 which the greatest quantity of the luminous rays passed. This, I think,
 proves that the luminous spectrum .has two distinct influences on the plant;
 or otherwise, that its action is modified by some peculiar functions of the

 plant itself.

     I submit these few results, incomplete as they are, to the attention of the

 Association without any further remark. I do not consider that my experi-
 ments have as yet proceeded far enough to warrant my taking up the time
 of the Meeting with any opinion I may have formed. I hope the result of

the apparent contradictions which at present exist. I have planned many

Wethese experiments require much time, and often to be repeated.   have

to deal with a subtile agent, and the few results which I have already ob-

tained, convince me of the existence of some secret principle in light, which

I hope to render evident to the senses by its operations, although it may not

itself be sensible to the human eye.

Report on the Fossil Fishes of the Devonian System or Old lied

   Sandstone. By Louis Agassiz*, Professor of Nat. Hist, at

    Neufchatel.

Having been requested by the British Association for the Advancement

of Science to draw up a report on the Fossil Fishes of the Old Red Sand-

mystone, I think it.  duty, in the first place, to mention the favourable cir-

cumstances which have allowed me to undertake this labour, and under

what auspices I have been able to accomplish a part of the important task

confided to me.

   It would be very difficult for me to give at present an idea of the limited

extent of the knowledge possessed a few years back of the fossils of a for-
mation very little known at that time, and which, nevertheless, is found at

the present day to extend over a considerable portion of the surface of

Europe. But if the rapid progress of discoveries in this field renders

the appreciation of their limits almost impossible, I must nevertheless ac-

knowledge, above all, that it is to the persevering researches and indefatiga-

ble zeal of English geologists that science is indebted for the knowledge of

one of the most curious faunas, I might even say one of the strangest, that

has hitherto engaged the attention of palaeontologists. When I Visited Scot-

land for the first time, in 1834, Dr. Fleming and Messrs. Sedgwick and Mur-

chison were the  only persons who had signalized fossil fishes in  the old red
                                                                                                                     ;

the first having described various scales from Clashbinnie, which he consi-

dered allied to the sturgeons; while Messrs. Sedgwick and Murchison, as-

sisted by Cuvier, Valenciennes, and Pentland, published the description of

two new genera of fossil fish from Caithness. The total number of species

then determined amounted only to four, and only one of these had been

fio-ured. I have already mentioned in various parts of my ' RechercKes sur les

Poissons Fossiles,' the numerous communications which were made to me at

that time on the subject, principally by Mr. Murchison, Mr. Lyell, and Dr.

Traill, who enabled me to increase the number of genera to ten, and that of

the species to seventeen, previous to the appearance of Mr. Murchison's great

work on the Silurian system. Such was the impetus given to the study of

the ancient rocks by the publication of this important work, that on visiting

Scotland again in 1840, during the meeting of the British Association at

Glasgow, I had occasion to examine, in consequence of communications

which were made to me, nearly double .the number of genera, and treble

the number of species of fossil fishes, which had all been recently discovered,

and had not yet been described. In one of the meetings of the Geological

Section, I was, nevertheless, able to draw the attention of geologists and

paleontologists to some of the most curious types I had just examined the

characters of, forms agreeing so little with all we knew previously in re-

gard to fossils, that it was impossible to determine at first sight even the
        ON THE FOSSIL FISH OF THE DEVONIAN SYSTEM.                        81

class to which they belong. Never shall I forget the impression which

the sight of these creatures, provided with appendages resembling wings,
produced upon me, when I had assured myself that they belonged to the
class of fishes. It was an entirely new type which was about to figure for

--the first time since it had ceased to exist in the series of beings, again to

form a link which nothing of all that had been revealed up to the time,

with regard to extinct creations, would have led us even to suspect the exist-

ence of; showing forcibly that observation alone can lead us to the recogni-
tion of the laws of development of organized beings, and how much we should

guard against all those systems of transformation of species which the ima-

gination invents with as much facility as reason refutes them. The merit

of the discovery of these curious fossils is chiefly due to Mr. H. Miller, and

I had only to fix their characters, and their relations to the fossil fishes al-

ready known, for all their importance to be appreciated. I believe that the

minute and comparative study of the type which I have called Pterichthys,

and of the not less curious genusdiscovered at Caithness by Messrs. Murchison

and Sedgwick, and to which I have applied the name Coccosteus, will open to

comparative palaeontology a field not less fruitful than was the first announce-

ment, now nearly a quarter of a century ago, of the Ichthyosauri and Plesio-

Howsauri.  many interesting relations of organization have we not a right to

expect to discover in analysing the solid remains of animals which have been

regarded by the most able naturalists successively as Tortoises, Fishes, Crus-

tacea, and even Coleoptera ! Mr. Miller has already made known, in a separate

publication, a portion of the palseontological treasures contained in the old red

sandstone of the neighbourhood of Cromarty. The difficulties, almost insur-

mountable, which have occurred in determining fossils, varying so much from

those already known as these two genera, have necessarily required on my part

numerous and repeated comparisons, and a minute study of the smallest frag-

ments preserved in all the collections of Scotland, to which I should have been

unable to apply myself, notwithstanding the facilities afforded me for this exa-

mination by all the persons possessing any of these fossils, had it not been for

the assistance which the British Association has kindly afforded me.

   Among the recent contributions which have so considerably increased our

knowledge of the fossil fishes of the Devonian system, I must place in the first

rank what has been accomplished by Lady Gordon Cumming in order to il-

lustrate this ancient fauna. Not satisfied with collecting and distributing

among geologists with unequalled liberality the numerous specimens of these

remains, which she had collected in a quarry worked on purpose, she studied

them with care, placed aside the most perfect specimens, and painted them

with a precision of detail and an artistic talent to which very few naturalists

have been able to attain. These drawings, indeed, and those of her daugh-

ter, who constantly assisted her in her studies, will form one of the principal
ornaments of my ' Monograph.' On the point of presenting this selection to

the public, it is painful to me to think that this noble lady will no more be

able herself to receive from geologists the tribute of gratitude which she so

justly deserved. May this record, planted upon her grave, remind her esti-

mable companion that the willingness with which she assisted her parent has

contributed to raise for her a lasting monument in the scientific world.

Dr. Malcolmson has likewise deserved well of the geology of the old red

sandstone by the memoir which has been recently inserted in the Transactions

of the Geological Society of London. Endeavouring to characterize this

formation with the greatest possible precision, he had caused to be made

beautiful drawings of a very large number of fragments of fish which occur

in it ; their fragmentary state, however, did not allow of my determining

184.2.     g

them with sufficient accuracy previous to the printing of his memoir for the

palaeontological portion to be published at the same time. These drawings,

however, will not be lost to science perhaps the larger portion are already
                                                                                                                                                            ;

published. Alexander Robinson has also devoted himself with much success
to the investigation of the fossil fishes of the old red : he even forwarded to me

some very rare ones, with a book of drawings executed in a superior style,

representing those contained in the Museum of Elgin and in several private

collections. The collections of Lord Enniskillen and of Sir P. Egerton have

likewise furnished very beautiful specimens from the old red sandstone of

the North of Scotland ; and these gentlemen have had the great kindness to

cause Mr. Dinkel to draw for me all those which it appeared desirable to

publish. Dr. Traill and Mr. Strickland again have increased the number of

known species, already so considerable, from the schists of the Orkney Islands,

which appear to be an inexhaustible deposit.

While the North of Scotland thus furnished treasures hitherto unknown,

Professor Jameson and Mr. Anderson were collecting in the counties of the

South the species contained in the upper strata of this formation, which are

not less curious nor less well-preserved, and of which several have been

figured very fairly by Mr. Anderson in his interesting Memoir on the

Geology of Fifeshire.

   Thanks to the distant excursions of Mr. Murchison, I need not confine

my report on the fishes of the Devonian system to the species found in the

British Islands, but I am able to compare them with those which that inde-

fatigable geologist has brought with him from Russia, and which exhibit the

MM.most perfect identity with those of Scotland. On the continent,  Omalius

d'Halloy and Hoeninghausen have likewise found some scaly-plates of fishes

Myirom this formation.  Report would be imperfect were I not to notice

the doubts which have long since been entertained with regard to these

large scaly plates of the old red sandstone, which have been cast at various

times into the most different classes of the animal kingdom, and even of the

vegetable kingdom, and which are at present solved in a satisfactory manner.

They must be referred to the Crustacea, of which Dr. Buckland and myself

were convinced at the meeting at Glasgow.

At present I will offer some general considerations on the characters and

the geological distribution of the species of fossil fishes which are found in

the various strata of the Devonian system, reserving the descriptive details

for the special part of my ' Monograph.'
   On this occasion I cannot refrain from making a general observation on

the method to be followed in determining these fossils. There was a period,

already remote from us, when the most superficial approximations between

the organic fragments buried in the strata of the surface of our globe and

the species at present living at its surface sufficed for the investigations of

the time. Cuvier was the first who applied to these determinations the ne-

cessary precision, establishing them on satisfactory comparison one with the

other and with the living species : and the results, therefore, at which he

arrived, have undergone no modification with time. Unfortunately, the

method employed by Cuvier is not yet very generally followed ; nume-

rous works on fossils might be mentioned whose authors have never studied

the recent animals which might have some analogy with the fossils they de-

scribe, trusting to the general results obtained by their predecessors, or else

establishing their analogies from the comparison of simple figures. More-

over, now that a new and efficacious means of determining accurately the

structure of fossil remains has come into use, it is less possible than ever to

admit into the sanctuarv of science results which have not been submitted to
ON THE FOSSIL FISH OF THE DEVONIAN SYSTEM.  83

the test of the most severe criticism. It suffices, in fact, to look at the bril-

liant results obtained by Mr. Owen from the structure of the teeth, to bo

convinced that in future no palaeontologist will be able to avoid microscopical
researches, if he wishes to arrive at a profound knowledge of the beings of
which he has undertaken to reconstruct the forms and the organization, even
in its most minute particularities. If, however, such detailed researches are
indispensable to establish general results, which sooner or later become public
property, it is not less important that they be expressed in the most simple
and correct manner, to render them intelligible to the largest number.

   One of the first observations to make on the ichthyological fauna of the
old red sandstone is, that it is wholly peculiar to this formation ; its numerous

species differ alike from those of the Silurian system and from those of the
carboniferous strata ; the greater portion of the genera even of the Devo-
nian system are restricted to the duration of this geological system, and of
tnis number are those containing most species, such as the genera Pterich-
thys, Coccosteus, Cephalaspis, Osteolcpis, Dipterus, Glyptolepis, Platygna-

thus, Dendrodus, Diplacanthus, Cheiracanthus, and Cheirolepis. Among

the genera which have representatives in the Silurian rocks or in the car-
boniferous series, such as the genera Onchus, Ctenacanthus, Ctenoptychius,

Ptyc/tacanthus, Acanthodes, Diplopterus, and Holoplychius, I am not ac-

quainted with a single one of which the species are identical in these dif-
ferent formations ; but, on the contrary, each formation in which they are
represented has its peculiar ones. This result agrees admirably with those

winch I have already obtained for the other strata of the series of rocks of

which the crust of our globe is composed, as well in my researches on fos-
sil fishes as also in those on the fossil Echinodermata and Mollusca. And
if my conclusions with regard to this latter class of animals were frequently

not in harmony with those of the greater number of conchologists, I have
at least the satisfaction of finding at present M. d'Orbigny arrive at the same
results from the study of other families and of other formations than those I
examined. This difference in the results which I had obtained arises, with-

out doubt, from my having applied, in determining the fossil remains of the
Mollusca, the same principles of criticism which have always guided me in

the determination of the fossil Vertebrata.

   It is now a truth which I consider as proved, that the " ensemble " of or-

ganized beings was renewed not only in the interval of each of the great
geological divisions which we have agreed to term formations, but also at the
time of the deposition of each particular member of all the formations ; for

example, I think that I can prove that in the oolitic formation, at least

within the limits of the Swiss Jura, the organic contents of the lias, those of
the oolitic group properly so called, those of the Oxfordian group, and those
of the Portlandian group, as they occur in Switzerland, are as different from

each other as the fossils of the lias from those of the Keuper, or those of
the Portlandian beds from those of the Neocomian formation. I also be-
lieve very little in the genetic descent of living species from those of the va-
rious tertiary layers which have been regarded as identical, but which, in

my opinion, are specifically distinct. I cannot admit the idea of the trans-

formation of species from one formation to another. In advancing these
general notions, I do not wish to offer them as inductions drawn from the
study of any particular class of animals (of the fishes for instance), and ap-
plied to other classes, but as the results of direct observation of very con-
siderable collections of fossils of different formations, and belonging to dif-
ferent classes of animals, in the investigation of which I have been spe-
cially engaged for many years, in order to assure myself whether the con-

                                         g2
                   ;

--84 REPORT 1842.

elusions which I had drawn from the tribe of fishes were applicable to this

class only, or whether the same relation existed in the other remains of the

animal kingdom.
    Another fact results in the most evident manner from the simple inspec-

tion of the specimens of these fossils which have hitherto been collected,
viz. that the very large majority of the species are of middle and even of

small size. I dwell on this circumstance because it has afforded me an op-

portunity of rectifying an exaggeration which has been pretty generally

adopted, and which consists in representing the species of ages anterior to
our own as being generally larger than those now existing. The idea of a
gigantic size has become, so to say, the necessary reflection of a tableau of
 fossils of all the geological epochs, and nevertheless such a manner of view-

 ing the question is quite out of the pale of truth. In fact, if it seems strange
 to us to find in the diluvial strata of Europe, and even of the northern por-
 tion of this continent, fossil fragments of Pachydermata very similar to those

 now existing in the tropical regions, and differing very much from those
 which inhabit these countries at present, it wrould nevertheless be an exag-

 geration to represent those fossils as vastly superior in size to the animals
 of the same families and even of the same genera which live in our days
 and even as regards the species of Pachydermata of the lower tertiary rocks,
 it is necessary to admit that those of our time, taking all into consideration,
 are evidently larger than the former. I do not pretend on this account to

 deny the fact of the existence in certain fossil families of types much larger

 in size than those of the present day, I only intend to state that these propor-
 tions have been exaggerated, and that this disposition to exaggeration has

 occasioned a neglect of the study of the remote relations of these types be-

--tween each other, and with those which have preceded and those which have

 followed them relations which appear to me alone capable of solving this

 enigma. It is incontestable, for instance, that the reptiles of the oolitic rocks,
 the Ichthyosauri and the Megalosauri in particular, possessed dimensions to
 which no type of the reptiles of our time has been found to attain; but

 in comparing them with reptiles now existing, it must not be forgotten that
 these gigantic reptiles lived at a time when the Mammifera did not yet exist, or
 at least had not yet acquired the preponderance they now have; when theCeta-
 cea and Pachydermata were as yet only projected in the plan of Nature ; when
 the class of fishes and that of the reptiles reigned in sovereignty ; and when,

--consequently, it is not surprising to see the Reptilia, which, in separating from

 the Fishes after the carboniferous formations, are examples of a real progress

--in this series of the Vertebrata, prepare a new progress, a movement towards

 the class of the Mammifera and that of the Birds by the introduction of the
 type of the Ichthyosauri, which announces in some measure the Cetacea; of the
 type Megalosaurus, which might be considered in relation with the Pachy-

 dermata ; and of the bird-like type of the Pterodactyli. For my part, there-

 fore, I cannot regard simply as ordinary reptiles those types precursory of

analogous types which are met with at a later period in other classes; I am

 rather inclined to view them as types prophetic of the more recent ages ; and
 hence it is necessary to apply to their study "a different measure from that
 which should be employed when the object is to fix the degree of analogy
 existing between contemporary types. I might apply these same considera-
 tions to other families, and carry them even further, if I had not already ob-
served elsewhere that among the fossil fishes the family of the Sauroids, of
 which the carboniferous series contain such remarkable fragments, might be
viewed as announcing, by its ambiguous characters, the introduction of the
reptiles, at a period when this class was not yet represented on the earth. Nor
                                                                                                                                                    --;

                                              ON THE FOSSIL FISH OF THE DEVONIAN SYSTEM.                                                                      85

is it here the place to examine, under this point of view, the invertebrated ani-

mals, the study of which has likewise red me to very curious considerations

I will confine myself solely to the mentioning, in relation to the fishes of the

old red sandstone, that the small size of the great majority of the species,
compared with those of more recent periods, is a fact agreeing with what is

observed relatively to the first development of the greater part of the classes
of the animal kingdom. The genera of fish of the old red sandstone, the

species of which are of middle or small size, are the following : Pterichthys,
Cephalaspis, Osteolepis, Dipterus, Glyptolepis, Acanthodes, Diplacanthus,

Cheiracanthus, and Cheirolepis ; and I mean by species of middle or of small
size in the class of fish, such as do not exceed the length of one or two feet.
The genera Diplopterus, Coccosteus, and the four Placoidian genera of this
formation, contained species certainly larger, but which nevertheless appear
to me not to have exceeded two or three feet in length. The genera Holo*

ptychius,Dendrodus, and Platygnathus, alone contained species of larger size
but I doubt if any one of them has attained the dimensions of our Sharks

and our Sword-fish, and much less those of the large Tunny.
   The close relation which appears to exist between the size of animals and

their organization, is evident in nearly all the families of the animal kingdom;

to be convinced of this, it suffices to pass in review a small collection only of

animals.

Nothing is more striking in a museum arranged systematically, than the

conformity in size of species of the same family, where the extremes of the

Howdifferences are generally circumscribed within very narrow limits.                                                                                         little

do the Quadrumana differ in reality one from the other in size ; what uni-

formity in this respect in their ensemble, among the Cheiroptera, the Insecti-
vora, the Rodents, the Ruminants; among the birds of prey, the Granivora,

the Chelonians, the Anourous Batrachians ; among Insects, taken as a whole,

compared                                      with other                                                 classes ;  among  Infusoria,    &c. &c.    The same rela-
                                                                                                      .

tions equally exist between the families of Fishes ; and the diversity in size

which I have just noticed, among the species of different genera of this

formation, is indeed the first indication of the diversity of the types to

which they belong. I will point out, in the first place, four genera of the

Placoidian order, the genera Ctenacanthus, Onchus, Ctenoptychius and Pty-

chacanthus, which are provided with spinous rays to the dorsal fins, re-

sembling the gigantic Ichthyodorulites of the carboniferous and Jurassic for-

mations, but differing in their less considerable size; they are distinguished

among themselves by the forms and the ornaments of their rays. In the order
of Ganoid fishes, the genera Acanthodes, Diplacanthus, Cheiracanthus, and

Cheirolepis, present themselves at first sight as a separate group ; for although
covered, like the others, with enamelled scales, these are so small that they im-
part to the skin the appearance of shagreen. The manner in which the fins

are sustained by spinous rays, or the absence of these rays, and the position

of the fins themselves, have served as characters in the establishing of these

genera. The genera Pterichthys, Coccosteus, and Cephalaspis, form a second

group exceedingly curious : the considerable development of the head, its
size, the large .plates which cover it, and which likewise extend over the

greater portion of the trunk, and the moveable appendages in the form of a
wing, placed on the side of the head, give to them the most remarkable ap-
pearance. It is these peculiarities, indeed, which caused the class to which
these genera belong for a long time to be misunderstood. The large bony and

granulated plates of Coccosteus led to their being considered as belonging to

Trionyx                                       and  it  will  be                                          a sufficient  excuse  for this  error  to  call  to  recollection
                                           ;

that the greatest anatomist of our age had sanctioned this approximation.
--86 report 1842.

The form of the disc of the head of the Cephalaspides, which has the appear-
ance of a large crescent, and their more numerous but very elevated scales,
resembling the transverse articulations of the body, explain how it was possi-

ble to see in these fishes Trilobites of a particular genus. Lastly, the winged
appendages of the sides of the head of Pterichthys, as moveable as fins, have

  easily °-iven rise to the variety of opinions concerning the true affinities of these
 singular creatures, and has caused them to be taken at one time for gigantic
  Coleoptera, at another for Crustacea or small marine Tortoises ; so little do
  the types of the classes appear fixed in certain respects at those remote times.
  Another singularity of these genera is the association to the bony plates of
  the head of a vertebral appendage, which is far from having acquired the
. same solidity, but appears, on the contrary, to have remained fibro-cartilagi-
  nous during the whole life of the animal, resembling in this respect the ske-

leton of the Sturgeon.

It would be difficult to find among recent fishes types presenting any direct

analogy with the genera Pterichthys,  Coccosteus, and  Cephalaspis                                                               it is only
                                                                                                                              ;

from afar that they can be compared to some abnormal genera of our epoch.

Thus the Sturgeons, (and especially Loricaria and Callichthys), offer but a

slight analogy with the Cephalaspis in their shielded head, and in the bony

plates of their flanks ; the bony shields ornamented with scidptures and re-

gular granulations, which protect the head of the Trigla, of the Peristediones,

and of the Dactylopteri, in a slight degree call to mind what is seen in the

"·enus Coccosteus, without however the analogy being perfect ; the structure

of the throat and the remainder of the skeleton are very different ; and lastly,

I find it impossible directly to compare those moveable appendages of the

sides of the head of Pterichthys to anything observable in fishes of the present

period. Perhaps they have some relation with the moveable sub-orbitals of

the Acanthopsis of the family of the Cyprinoids ; perhaps they might likewise

be compared to the prolongations of the prreoperculum o£ certain Trighc,

and in particular of the genus Cephalacanthus ; but I have found it impossi-

ble as yet to determine precisely with what bone of the head these extraor-

dinary appendages must be considered parallel. As to the less solid nature of

the vertebral column of these fishes, they have it in common with the greater

part of the species of the older rocks. The analogy which they offer on the

one hand in form with the dorsal cord of the embryo of fishes, together

with the inferior position of their mouth, which is equally met with in the

embryos, and, on the other hand, the distant resemblance of these fishes to

certain types of reptiles, present the most curious assemblage of characters

that can possibly be conceived.

  A third group of fishes belonging to this formation comprises those genera

whose vertical fins are double on the back and under the tail, and which
approach very near to the caudal. These are the genera Dipterm, Osteo-
lepis, Diploptervs, and Glyptolepis, which differ from one another by the

form of their scales and their dentition.

   And lastly, it seems to me necessary to regard as a fourth group of this

order the genera which are characterized by large conical teeth situated

on the margin of the jaws, between which are alternately smaller, and in-
deed very small ones in form of a brush ; such are the genera Holoptychms

and Platygnathus, and the genus recently established by Mr. Owen under

the name of Dendrodus, and respecting which this learned anatomist has
o-iven some exceedingly interesting microscopical details. These were evi-
dently the Pirates of their day ; but it would be difficult to determine pre-
cisely their size, for the very simple reason that nowhere have any portions

of their body of any considerable size been discovered assembled together.

What we possess of them is nothing more than some detached scales, isolated
teeth, and some broken bony plates.

    This primitive diversity of the ichthyoid types of a formation so ancient

as the old red sandstone, is, in my opinion, one of the facts the most con-

tradictory to the theory of the successive transformation of species, and of
the descent of organized beings now living from a small number of primitive
forms.

   In support of these general observations I add the synoptical table of all
the species of this formation which I have to the present time been able to

determine, and of which the detailed descriptions will be found in my

88 REPORT 1842.

It results from this table, that the Devonian system contains not less than fifty-

five species of fossil fish belonging to twenty different genera ; a number more than

ten times that which was nominally known in the entire series of formations of the

WhoBritish Islands ten years ago.  at that time would have believed that fifty-five

species of vertebrated animals would have been discovered in one of the formations

of the transition rocks ?

 Appendix to a Report on the Strength and other Properties of Cast

   Iron obtainedfrom the Hot and Cold Blast. By William Fair-

     bairn, Esq.

 The experiments, of which the present is a notice, were entered upon in
 March 1837, and subsequently the British Association did me the honour to

 print them in their seventh volume of Transactions. They were intended to
 determine an important quality in the strength of materials, viz. the powers
 of crystalline bodies to sustain pressure for an indefinite period of time, and
 to ascertain whether cast iron, when subjected by a given weight to long-
 continued transverse strain, would, or would not, be subject to fracture.

     It appears that former writers on the transverse strength of materials had
 come to the conclusion, that the bearing powers of cast iron were confined
 within the limits of that force which would produce a permanent set, and
 that it would be unsafe to load this material with more than about one-third
 of the weight necessary to break it. This assumption is, however, incorrect,
as the experiments which follow will abundantly testify.

    It would be superfluous to offer in this notice any observations on a dif-
ferent theory, as the recent experiments of Mr. Hodgkinson and myself fully
prove* that cast iron takes a permanent set with a load considerably under
one-sixth of the breaking weight.

   From these experiments, it will be found that cast iron is more to be de-
pended upon, and exhibits more tenacity in resisting heavy strains long con-

tinued, than is generally admitted, and its bearing powers have deserved a
much higher reputation than has at any former period been given to them
indeed it is evident from the experiments, that a cast-iron bar is capable of

resisting for a series of years a force equal to §ths, and sometimes ^yths of
the load that would break it.

    In the application of this force, it must be observed, that the room in
which the experiments were made, and which are now in progress, is not
entirely free from vibration, being slightly affected by persons crossing the
floor, particularly when two or more are walking at the same time.

    The experiments already published on the " Effects of Time," embrace a
period of fifteen months, from the 6th of March 1837 to the 23rd of June
1838. Up to that time the deflections of both hot and cold blast iron were
carefully registered ; and the present is a continuation of the same experi-

ments, exhibiting the changes that have taken place for the last four years,
and the effects which the permanent weights have produced upon the bars.

It is satisfactory to observe that, during the whole time of the experiments,

the bars (whether loaded with the lighter or heavier weights) exhibited little

or no change beyond what may be traced to the variations of temperature.
One of the bars was, however, found broken some time since, but whether
from accident or the effects of continued strain I am unable to determine with
certainty ; I am inclined to believe that the former was the cause, as the cor-

responding bars still retain their position, indicating changes so exceedingly

   If we examine the results of this table, it will be observedthat the deflec-
tion in the cold blast iron has not increased but rather decreased since June
1S38, an anomaly not easily accounted for, unless from some error in writing

--down the figures 1-316, which according to the progressive increase which
--has been going forward since the commencement of the experiments should

have been 1*306. On comparing the rate of increase of the deflection in
this table with Table XII. in my former Report, it will be seen that the

tendency downwards has been regular and progressive (with the above ex-
ception) up to the present date. In the hot blast iron it is also progressive,
the increase of deflection in four years being -082.

    It will be observed, that the state of the atmosphere has considerable in-
fluence upon the bars, an increase of temperature producing a correspond-
ing increase of deflection, and vice versa.

Another instrument consists of four horizontal glass tubes, slightly turned

up at each end, and filled with mercury. These tubes are laid down on the

solid floor of a room, according to the different points of the compass; and
it is expected that, when a shock takes place, the mercury will flow out of

one or more of these tubes. If there is a horizontal movement of the earth's
surface, say in a direction from W. to E., the mercury will flow out of the

west end of the tube placed in that direction, and partially out of two

other tubes. If there is no horizontal movement, but an inclination of the
ground only, the mercury will flow out of the tube or tubes affected by the

inclination, and probably in a larger measure from the ends of the tubes to-

wards the dip. This instrument was made by Mr. Newman of London, under

the directions of Professor Wheatstone and Mr. Milne.

The two remaining instruments are intended exclusively to indicate any

vertical movements of the ground. They consist of a horizontal bar, fixed

to a solid wall by means of a strong flat watch-spring, and loaded at the op-

posite end. If the wall suddenly rises or sinks, the loaded end of this hori-
zontal rod remains, from its vis inertia, nearly at rest, and thus can move any

light substance (as paper or a straw) brought against it by the vertical move-

ment of the ground, and which light substance is so adjusted as to stick

wherever the rod leaves it.

   One of this last mentioned class of instruments, and the one formed with

--glass tubes, have been set at Comrie, in the upper story of a house occupied

by Mr. Macfarlane, post-master there, a very intelligent person, and most

anxious to aid the Committee in their inquiries. He has kept an accurate

register of all the shocks felt at Comrie during the last three years.

In regard to the instruments formed on the principle of the watchmaker's

noddy, one of them has been placed at Crieff (six and a half miles east of

AComrie), under the charge of the Rev. Mr. M'Alester.        second has been

placed at St. Fillans (a small village five and a half miles west of Comrie)

Aunder the charge of the Rev. Mr. Logan.      third is placed at Invergel-

die, about five miles north of Comrie, under charge of the farm-overseer

Athere.  fourth instrument of this kind is about to be sent to Kinlochmoi-

dant, near Strontian in Argyleshire, where shocks are occasionally felt. It

Wm.is to be taken charge of there by  Robertson, Esq., the proprietor of

Kinlochmoidart. To the same place there is to be sent one of the horizontal

bars intended to indicate vertical movements of the ground.

Besides the foregoing instruments, others of a meteorological character

have been placed at Comrie, in order that the state of the atmosphere at the

moment of the shocks, and the nature of the weather generally during their
occurrence, may be as nearly as possible ascertained. These instruments
consist of a barometer, double thermometer, and a rain-gauge. They are
under the charge of Mr. Macfarlane of Comrie, by whom their indications

are regularly registered.

   III. The Committee will next notice any effects produced on the instru-
ments, during the course of last year, by earthquake shocks. The instru-

ments sent lately by the Committee have not yet been affected, having been

but a short time at their respective stations. Those which have been af-

fected, were the instruments sent last year.

   1. On the 26th of July 1841 (as Mr. Macfarlane reports), a shock oc-
curred, which is noticed in the register. The inverted pendulum set in the

steeple of Comrie parish church was thrown about half an inch to the west,
apparently indicating a horizontal movement of the ground as much towards

the east. Another instrument, invented by Mr. Macfarlane himself, on the

principle of the common pendulum, and kept at his own house, about 150
yards from the church, had vibrated in a direction due east and west. On

this occasion an itpioard heave of the ground, to the extent of half an inch,

was also indicated by two instruments, one of them being a horizontal bar,

of the nature before described.

2. The next shock by which the instruments were affected, occurred on

the 30th of July 1841. Mr. Macfarlane reports that the two inverted pen-

dulums in his house vibrated to the extent of half an inch, and in a direction
south and north, which is different from previous indications. At Tomperran

(about a mile and a half east of Comrie), an instrument on the principle of

the common pendulum vibrated east and west. The instruments for showing

any vertical movement were but slightly affected.

Notwithstanding the slight nature of the effects of this shock on the in-

struments, Mr. Macfarlane reports that it was very severe, though not so

violent as the one which occurred in October 1839. Reckoning this former

one at 10, he says the shock of July 30, 1841, may be reckoned 8. He adds,

that " it was distinctly double, the latter part, if anything, more violent than

the first : the noise and shake awful, at least I felt them so in the house,

and those out of doors gave the same account. It is difficult to account for

the smallness of its effects on the instruments. Perhaps the vibrations of the

ground, though violent, were short and frequent, and thereby interrupted the

natural swing of the pendulums. I recollect some person, on the occurrence of

one of the former severe earthquakes, describes his feelings as if on horseback,

when the animal shook itself. Somewhat such were my impressions on the

30th, even before I had looked at the instruments. It is said here that there

were twelve shocks that day. I felt nine myself; there was one about

8 a.m., pretty smart, and none else till the great one about 2\ p.m. Imme-
diately after it there were two or three slight shocks, and about an hour

afterwards a loud one, &c. The weather was cold and inclined to stormy

about the time of the severe shock, and for a day or two before and after."

In a subsequent letter, dated August 9, 1841, by which time Mr. Macfar-

lane had visited all the places in and near Comrie affected by the shock, he

Agives some details, which it may not be out of place here to notice. "

house at Garrickrow (about two miles west of Comrie) was so severely

handled that three out of four chimney-tops will require to be rebuilt or re-

Apaired, and there is a rent in the west gable of the house.                                                      man from

Comrie, who happened to be working at the time on the hill behind, de-

scribes the shock as awful indeed ; and he says the trees around him were so

much agitated that he thought they would have been torn out of the roots, but

he cannot remember exactly in what direction they waved, but thinks it was

east and west. The wall of one of the houses of Ross (the neat suburb of

our city) was rent, and the miller's house (you '11 recollect it), in spite of its

numerous abutments, has had its rents much enlarged. This shock, I learn,

has been felt as far east, at least, as Newburgh, about thirty-eight miles from

Garrickrow                                                     as far to  the west as  Dalmally, the distance of  which I do not

it was taken down and rebuilding when I saw it. The directions in which

the stones have been moved, seem to have been various. It is remarkable

that neither the row of chimney-stacks on the hot-house wall, of the same

construction with those of the gardener's cottage (octagonal), nor those of

the gamekeeper's house, which is a little up the hill, have been injured.

The gardener told me the foundation of all the buildings thereabout (except

the last) was upon a gravelly soil, but how near the subjacent rock he could

Anot guess.  person who happened to be on the hill or rising ground im-

mediately to the west of Duneira House, told me as a proof of the shock

having come even there from the west, that after the shock passed him he

heard the rattle of the slates and of the buildings about Duneira; but this

you will at once see was not evidence of the alleged fact. Another stand-

ing on the hill above, said that he thought he saw the disturbance of

the woods pass eastward. This was near Comrie. Those in the wooden

shed at the saw-mill near Duneira, saw the roof open for a moment ; and

when they rushed from the shed, they observed that the water in the mill-

head was for a short time dammed backwards, and raised about four inches

above its former level at that place ; and from this, and other indications,

they judged that the earth there was heaved directly upwards about six inches.

There were traces of electricity in the clouds at the time, and other pecu-

liarities in the appearance of the sky, but nothing amounting to the least

hint, so far as I could judge, that we were to be so roughly handled. I re-

collect before of noticing the appearance of the sky as lurid and particularly

sombre when we had quakings below, but I have frequently since seen the

same, or even stronger marks of the same kind, and yet all pass peaceably

off, and, on the other hand, earthquakes when the sky was clear and open.

Even a course of previous wet weather, which, from its being hitherto an

almost constant forerunner of the violent and frequent shocks, warranted

the inference that they were somehow connected, does not seem to be a sine

qua non ; so that the remark of a sagacious old man, one well-known here

as ' Deacon lleid,' will hold good, who long ago, in the first series of our

earthquakes, had been paying particular attention to the phenomena, and

being asked if he had made out whether they affected the weather or the

weather them, replied that he had attended particularly to that point, and all

that he could make of them was, that there was ' aye some kind o' weather

when they happened.' I may here add, it was omitted in its proper place,

that the only difference I could observe in the circumstances of the shattered

chimneys about Duneira, was that they were all on walls or gables running

south and north, while those untouched had the walls on which they stood

east and west. Dykes were thrown down in many places."
   With reference to the part of Mr. Macfarlane's letter last quoted, it may

be proper to explain, that the spot from which the Perthshire shocks of

earthquake appear to emanate, is situated about a mile north of Duneira, and

therefore it is not difficult to understand why walls running north and south

should chiefly or exclusively have been rent, whilst walls running east and
west should have escaped. ' This explains the fact mentioned in Mr. Mac-

farlane's letter, that the hot-house wall and range of chimneys on it escaped

injury, whilst the west gable of the house at Garrickrow (a quarter of a mile

east of Duneira House) was rent.

   Accounts have been received by a Member of the Committee, of the effects

produced by the same shock in other parts of the country, which in so far as

interesting, will be given in a treatise he is publishing on British earthquakes.

                ON EARTHQUAKES IN GREAT BRITAIN.    97

3. On the 9th of September 1841, another pretty severe shock was felt

at Comrie, at about ten minutes before midnight. Mr. Macfarlane reports
concerning it, " The next morning the Association's instruments indicated as

follows :

" The steeple one was inclined to south three-quarters of an inch. The

Comrie House one inclined north half an inch.

   " No damage, that I have heard of, has been done. The weather for the
two preceding days was remarkably wet and close, much resembling that
in which the shocks occurred in 1839 ; so much so was the sky, that the

evening previous I was remarking to some folks here, that it looked very

like an earthquake night. But I have more than once observed the same

misty and lurid sky without any shock ; so that, after all, the thing may be

a mere coincidence."

The indications of the instruments, mentioned in Mr. Macfarlane's note,

do not coincide with those produced by previous shocks, and are in them-

selves somewhat perplexing, if they are assumed to have been caused by one

and the same shock. Comrie House is about half a mile due north from

Comrie Church, and it is difficult to understand how Comrie Church could

have moved three-quarters of an inch to the north, whilst at the same time

Comrie House was moved half an inch to the south, unless on the supposi-

tion that the intermediate ground was lifted up to an extent which certainly

would have been perceivable by the inhabitants.

But it will be seen from the register, that after the severe shock near mid-

night on the 9th of September, two other shocks occurred before the instru-

ments were examined. It is very possible, therefore, that the indications

registered were not the effects of only one shock.

4. On the 8th of June 1842, two shocks were felt at Comrie between one

and two in the morning, by which the horizontal pendulum in Mr. Macfar-

lane's house (recently rent) was affected. It indicated a vertical upheave of

the ground of fully a quarter of an inch.

From the foregoing details, it seems probable that the opinion entertained

by those acquainted with the locality, that the particular spot from which

the Perthshire shocks emanate on the earth's surface, is situated about one

mile north-north-east of Duneira House, and about one mile and a half north-

west of Comrie, may be correct. It is desirable therefore to have additional

instruments placed at Duneira, and in the neighbourhood of it, with the view

of approximating still nearer to the exact spot of discharge or emission. Two

instruments have been lately sent to Duneira and St. Fillans, from which, if
the shocks continue, some useful data may be expected.

Further, it is evidently desirable to have instruments greatly more sensi-

tive than any which the Committee yet possess ; and the Committee would
be greatly obliged for any hints which may be given to them with that view.

Some of the members of the Committee are now making experiments which

promise well : and if the Committee be reappointed, with a renewal of the

grant, they hope, even before the earthquaking season (autumn and winter)

commences in Perthshire, to be prepared for a correct registration of most

of the shocks.

IV. The Committee wish particularly to call the attention of the Associa-

tion to the importance of carrying on meteorological observations at Comrie.

There seem strong grounds for the opinion entertained by many, that an

intimate connection of some kind or other exists between earthquake shocks

and the state of the weather, or rather those various agents which affect the

weather. Some persons, indeed, maintain, that the shocks are nothing else

'than electrical discharges from the earth, and are preceded as well as followed

1842.                 h

by certain meteorological symptoms, which are capable of accurate registra-
tion. This view of the matter is, for the sake of the theory of earthquakes,
deserving of being tested by meteorological observations : and such observa-
tions have accordingly been commenced at Comrie, by means of instruments,
sent there in accordance with the recommendation contained in last year's
Report, and understood to have been approved of and sanctioned by the As-
sociation. At present the barometer and thermometer are observed at Com-
rie only twice in the twenty-four hours. It would, however, be evidently
desirable to have much more frequent observations, in order that the state
 of the atmosphere immediately before, as well as immediately after shocks,
should be ascertained. The Committee understand that there are two places
in Scotland, where, at the expense of the British Association, hourly obser-
vations of the barometer and thermometer are now made and registered.
The importance of these observations to meteorology is unquestionable ; and
 it is manifest that great additional value would be given to them were they
 carried on at Comrie, Avhere they would become subservient to another
 branch of scientific research. In this view of the matter they are strongly
 supported by the Meteorological Committee of the Association, whose con-
 vener (Sir David Brewster) may be with propriety consulted on this subject.

    The Committee have ascertained that proper persons can be found at
 Comrie, who, under the superintendence of Mr. Macfarlane, would observe
 the barometer and thermometer every hour in the twenty-four hours, at an
 expense of 40/. yearly ; and the Committee express a hope that the Associa-
 tion will enable them to carry this plan into effect.

    On this subject the Committee will only further observe, that they would

 be glad if some other meteorological instruments could be sent to Comrie.
 For an anemometer there is an excellent situation, viz. on the steeple of the
 parish church. It would be very desirable also to have some instrument
 capable of indicating the existence of any sudden changes in the electrical
 state of the earth or the atmosphere ; and it is understood that the expense
 of these instruments is not great.

    V. The Committee have not yet attempted the registration of earthquake
 shocks occurring in any other part of this country, except Scotland. Else-
 where the shocks are not so frequent, or so regular in their recurrence, as to
 warrant the establishment of instruments : at the same time there do appear
 to be some parts of the country much more subject to shocks than others.
 For example, the primary districts of Cornwall and Wales have pretty often
 experienced shocks ; ami if in the course of the following year any are re-
 peated in these quarters, it may be right to send some instruments there.

     VI. The Committee have finally to report, that the sum of 261. 16*. have
 been expended by them in the prosecution of their inquiries.

 Report of a Committee appointed at the Tenth Meeting of the Asso-
     ciation for the Construction of a Constant Indicatorfor Steam-en-

 In the conclusion of their last report the Committee stated it to be their
 purpose, during the present year, to apply the indicator to some of those en-
 gines whose work is registered by other means, and to compare the result of
 the two registrations. It is to this comparison that their labours have ac-

cordingly "been directed. Of the numerous engines whose duty is periodi-

cally recorded, none seemed to be so well adapted to their purpose as the
Cornish engine at the East London Water-works. The long-continued and
careful experiments of Mr. Wicksteed upon that engine*, have made the work
performed by it better known probably than that of any other engine. The
request of the Committee to be allowed to apply the indicator to it was at
once and most liberally acceded to, and every facility was afforded to them
during the progress of their experiments by the servants of the company.

mean work done by the steam (in lbs. one foot high) on each square inch of

the piston per stroke during that time (according to the indicator) was, by

Also the mean stroke of the engine, during that time, was (by the measure-
ment of the engineer) 9 ft. 10§ in., or 9*875 ft., so that the mean effective press-

~-- =ure of the steam upon each square inch of the piston was, by the indicator,

The whole number of units of work done upon each square inch of the pis-

ton, between the 28th of January and the 15th of February, was, by the in-

This number multiplied by the number of square inches in the piston, which
is 5019-5, gives the whole number of units of effective work done by the
steam upon the piston of the engine during the time of the experiments, or
the whole number of lbs. of water which would have been raised one foot

Comparison of the Results given by the Indicator with the Expemnetits of

              Mr. Wicksteed.                    t

   The effective work done by the steam per square inch of the piston per
stroke of the engine, as determined by the experiments of Mr. Wicksteed
(Experimental Inquiry, p. 22), was

                         =129-4 -7-30f 122-1.

   In Mr. Wicksteed's experiments the engine was assumed to make a mean
stroke of 10 feet. At the time of the experiments with the indicator, the
mean stroke of the piston was 9 ft. \0\ in. (by the measurement of the en-
gineer). The mean stroke being thus 1^ in. short of its former length, the

                                                                              ]i 1
work done per stroke is to be diminished by the r-^rth part, or the -^rth part.

This deduction being made, we obtain

The duty done per cwt. of coals, consumed between the 28th of January

and 1 5th of February, estimated by the water raised, was, by Mr. Wicksteed's

calculation,  81-627,471.

                                          Variations in the Registration.

   The greatest variations from the mean registration per stroke, as shown by
the table, occur on the 6th and the 1 1th of February. The latter differs from
the mean by -032, which is equivalent by the formula to 4*26 units of work.

  --These variations are due, 1st, to a variation in the length of the stroke,

                                                                                                   21
amounting to 2| in. at least, and giving a variation of the -r^th part, or the

units of work per square inch of the piston.

   * The coals used were small coals of the worst quality, Mr. Wicksteed having, it is well
known, adopted the excelleut expedient of contracting with the coal-merchant, on the part

of the company, to pay not according to the quantity or quality of the coals supplied, but
according to the pounds of water which the engine is made to raise by them one foot high ;
i. e. to pay the coal-merchant so much per unit of work doue by the coals. Had the best
Welch coals (such as are used in Cornwall) been used on this occasion, the duty would have

been 110 millions per cwt.

effective work, which is evidently that shown by the indicator.

which variation amounts, according to the statement of the engineer, to 16

work per square inch of the piston.
   The possible variation in the registration due to these two causes amounts,

therefore,

                                                                         Units per square inch.

            By variation in water-load, to .... 1*284.

            Total  3-827

   That further variation in the work of the engine which is due to a different
state of the packing of the piston and a different supply of oil, it is of course
impossible to estimate ; but it is not too much to assign to it a possible varia-
tion of T%ths of a unit of work per square inch of the piston per stroke. This
small variation, added to that shown to be due to the length of the stroke and
the water-load, accounts for the entire amount of the greatest variation in the
daily registration of the indicator, as shown by the table.

   If the friction of the indicator be neglected altogether, the work shown by
it per stroke will be 120'2944, whilst the work by experiment is 120-574.
The difference is on this supposition, therefore, only -27, or about one quarter

of a unit of work out of 120| units.
    In respect to these results it is sufficient to say, that no others ever obtained

by any of the instruments applied for a similar purpose have approached to
them in the accuracy of their registration of the work, although that regis-
tration, which was by those instruments limited to a single stroke, has been
by this extended continuously over 179,000 strokes; and that Mr. Wicksteed
has expressed an opinion that the results given by the indicator are probably
nearer to the true work of the engine than his own experimental results.

    These experiments having sufficiently established the general accuracy of

the instrument and its working qualities, as applied to single acting stationary
engines, the Committee became desirous of trying it on the marine engine, and
the directors of the Great Western steam-ship having kindly given their con-
sent, it was fixed upon the engines of that vessel when about to proceed on

her first vovage in the present year.
    Unfortunately no trial could be obtained of the particular expedients adopt-

ed for this new application of the instrument until the vessel was actually
upon her voyage, and the Committee regret to state that this costly experi-
ment was rendered useless for their purpose by circumstances which would
have been obviated had such a trial been possible, and which would have
been wholly unimportant and soon remedied on shore. Of these the princi-
pal was the accidental unscrewing of one of the pistons from the extremity

of the piston rod.

   The knowledge which would be supplied by a series of registrations of such
accuracy as those given by the indicator, as well in regard to the duty of

marine engines as in respect to the general conditions of the resistance op-
posed under different velocities to the motion of a vessel of the dimensions of

a steam-ship, is of vast importance practically and scientifically ; it is there-
fore desirable to repeat this experiment under more favourable circumstances.

   The attention of the Committee was directed by the Association, in the

second place, to an application of the admirable chronometrical instrument

suggested by M. Poncelet, and contrived and applied by M.Morin, to an ad-
measurement of the velocity of the piston of the steam-engine at different pe-
--104 REPORT 1842.

riods of the stroke. This velocity is dependent in engines working expan-
sively upon the particular law, according to which the pressure of the steam

varies as its volume expands ; any such law being assumed, the velocity may
be expressed by a mathematical formula in terms of that law and of other
given elements of the question. The determination of it by experiment thus
supplies a means (and apparently the best) of verifying the different formulas
which have been proposed to represent the true law of the expansion of steam.

   M. Morin has himself kindly undertaken to superintend the construction of
one of his instruments for the use of the Committee. It is in the hands of M.
Breguet, and they hope to receive it early in November.

    Nothing has hitherto approached to the admirable accuracy of the admea-
surements stated to have been given by this instrument. It discriminates be-
tween spaces described in successive intervals of time, whose duration does
not exceed the 10,000th part of a second, and measures them.

Report of a Committee on the Form of Ships. By John Scott

                                      Russell, 31. A.

It contained upwards of 20,000 observations, the result of careful experi-
ments on the resistance to models of ships of more than a hundred different
forms and sizes, and extending from small models of 30 inches long, to ves-
sels of 25 feet, 60 feet, and 200 feet long, and above 1000 tons burden.
These experiments were under the general superintendence of a Committee
of the Association, consisting originally of Sir John Robison, Mr. Scott
 Russell, and Mr. Smith. Unfortunately, the ill-health of Mr. Smith's family
had altogether deprived the Committee of his advice and assistance, but the
observations were personally conducted by Mr. Scott Russell, who had to
acknowledge the pleasure he had derived from conferring with his friend

Sir John Robison, with whom he had frequent occasion to consult during
the progress of the observations. The smaller experiments had been made in

 a reservoir in the ground attached to his (Mr. Russell's) residence, and the
larger ones in the open sea. It was probable that these results, maturely di-
 gested, and illustrated by accurate drafts of the forms of the ships subjected
 to experiment, would be published in such completeness as might be practi-
 cally serviceable to the naval constructor and mercantile ship-builder ; and
 he would therefore confine the present Report to a general account of the
 objects contemplated in the experiments, and the method by which these
 designs had been carried out. Several series of experiments have already
 been made, both by scientific bodies and by public-spirited men, for the ad-
 vancement of naval architecture. These had cost large sums of money, and
 consumed much valuable time and talent. To most of them it had been ob-

-- --jected unhappily not without reason first, that they had not been con-

 ducted with an adequate knowledge of the Avants of the constructor ; se-
 condly, that the forms of bodies submitted to experiment were by no means
such as are used by the ship-builder ; thirdly, that the scale on which these
 bodies were constructed was too small to claim for the results, as applied on a
large scale, any considerable degree of confidence ; fourthly, that it had not
 been established by what law the results of experiments on one scale of mag-
 nitude are to be transferred to a different scale, either greater or less ; and,
 fifthly, that the apparatus formerly used was liable to errors which it was

difficult to eliminate from the results. To obviate such objections was one
great object in these experiments. Mr. Russell had contrived a new appa-

 ratus, which was so simple and convenient, that a uniform propelling force
        --

            ON ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.         105

was obtained, by which vessels of any magnitude might be drawn by a uni-
form mechanical force along any given distance- The forms of the models

employed were not confined to mathematical and arbitrary solids, but were

those of such classes of ships as are either actually employed in navigation,

or have been proposed for that purpose. Among these were some of the

highest reputation. It was found that there were other circumstances be-

sides the form of the vessel which affected the result ; and that the form and

dimensions of the channel were as important as those of the vessel in deter-

mining it. Experiments had been instituted on the largest as well as the

smallest scale, to show the law of relation between different scales. These

various modes of experiment were illustrated by reference to drawings and
tables which were prepared for publication. As an illustration of the value

of giving a proper form to ships, altogether independently of proportion or

--dimension, the following remarkable experiments were adduced : Four ves-

sels, of about twenty-five feet length, having all the same dimensions of breadth

and depth, of the same capacity and weight, and of the same draft of water,

were towed together at the same time, under the same circumstances and at

the same velocity. Some writers on naval architecture have asserted that,

in such circumstances, vessels would have precisely the same resistance.

The forms of these four vessels were not, to an inexperieuced eye, very dis-

similar : they were all good sea boats, and each of them found its admirers
to give its shape a preference over the others. These vessels, alike in all

their principal dimensions, and weight, and area of midship section, and draft

of water, differed so much in resistance, that the one had nearly double re-

sistance to another : thus, at 7§- miles an hour, the resistances were as fol-

lows :

            No. I. form  56*6 lbs. resistance.

            No. II       138-5

            No. Ill      102-7

            No. IV       90-2

All of these were good sea boats, and it was one of the most valuable of
these results, that No. I., the form of least- resistance, was found also the best
sea boat, the easiest, and the driest. The whole of the observations, com-
prising more than 20,000, were in the course of preparation for publication, so

that the whole body of the observations would be at the disposal of the Mem-

bers of the Association. It had been the aim of the Committee to reduce the
whole into the form most immediately conducive to the purposes of the naval
constructor and mercantile ship-builder, and the drawings had been made on
the scale and with the accuracy of the drafts of ships of the largest class.

   Mr. Russell also explained a model showing the waves in a channel arising
from the natural channel wave and the wave resulting from the form of the

boat.

The Committee appointed by the Council of the British Association to

carry out the above object, beg leave to report, that at the meetings which

--they held in London the following gentlemen were added to the Committee

and assisted in its labours : Messrs. W. J. Broderip, Prof. Owen, W. E.
Shuckard, G. It. Waterhouse, and W. Yarrell. An outline of the proposed

code of rules having been drawn up and printed, copies of it were sent to

many eminent zoologists at home and abroad, who were requested to favour

the Committee with their observations and comments. Many valuable sug-

gestions were obtained from this source, by the aid of which the Committee

were enabled to introduce several important modifications into the original

Aplan.  few copies of the plan as amended were then printed for the use of

the Committee, and the total cost of printing these two editions amounts to

£4- 10s.

   As the probable success of this measure must greatly depend on its ob-
taining a rapid and extensive circulation among foreign as well as British
zoologists, the Committee beg to recommend that a small sum (say £5 10s.)
be appropriated for printing and distributing extra copies of this report in
the form which it may finally assume in our Transactions.

   The plan as amended has been further considered by the Committee du-
ring the present meeting at Manchester, and the Committee having thus
given their best endeavours to maturing the plan, beg now to submit it to
the approval of the British Association under the title of a

SERIES OF PROPOSITIONS FOR RENDERING THE NOMENCLATURE
               OF ZOOLOGY UNIFORM AND PERMANENT.

        PREFACE.

All persons who are conversant with the present state of Zoology must be

aware of the great detriment which the science sustains from the vagueness

Weand uncertainty of its nomenclature.  do not here refer to those diver-

sities of language which arise from the various methods of classification

adopted by different authors, and which are unavoidable in the present state

of our knowledge. So long as naturalists differ in the views which they are

disposed to take of the natural affinities of animals there will always be di-

versities of classification, and the only way to arrive at the true system of

nature is to allow perfect liberty to systematists in this respect. But the evil

complained of is of a different character. It consists in this, that when

naturalists are agreed as to the characters and limits of an individual group

or species, they still disagree in the appellations by which they distinguish it.

A genus is often designated by three or four, and a species by twice that

number of precisely equivalent synonyms ; and in the absence of any rule on

the subject, the naturalist is wholly at a loss what nomenclature to adopt.

The consequence is, that the so-called commonwealth of science is becoming

daily divided into independent states, kept asunder by diversities of language

as well as by geographical limits. If an English zoologist, for example, visits

the museums and converses with the professors of France, he finds that their
ON ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.  107

scientific language is almost as foreign to him as their vernacular. Almost
every specimen which he examines is labeled by a title which is unknown
to him, and he feels that nothing short of a continued residence in that
country can make him conversant with her science. If he proceeds thence
to Germany or Russia, he vis again at a loss : bewildered everywhere amidst
the confusion of nomenclature, he returns in despair to his own country and
to the museums and books to which he is accustomed.

    If these diversities of scientific language were as deeply rooted as the ver-
nacular tongue of each country, it would of course be hopeless to think of
remedying them ; but happily this is not the case. The language of science is
in the mouths of comparatively few, and these few, though scattered over di-
stant lands, are in habits of frequent and friendly intercourse with each other.
All that is wanted then is, that some plain and simple regulations, founded
on justice and sound reason, should be drawn up by a competent body of
persons, and then be extensively distributed throughout the zoological world.

    The undivided attention of chemists, of astronomers, of anatomists, of
mineralogists, has been of late years devoted to fixing their respective lan-
guages on a sound basis. Why, then, do zoologists hesitate in performing
the same duty ? at a time, too, when all acknowledge the evils of the present

anarchical state of their science.

     It is needless to inquire far into the causes of the present confusion of
zoological nomenclature. It is in great measure the result of the same branch

of science having been followed in distant countries by persons who were
either unavoidably ignorant of each other's labours, or who neglected to in-
form themselves sufficiently of the state of the science in other regions. And
when we remark the great obstacles which now exist to the circulation of
books beyond the conventional limits of the states in which they happen to
be published, it must be admitted that this ignorance of the writings of others,
however unfortunate, is yet in great measure pardonable. But there is another

--source for this evil, which is far less excusable, the practice of gratifying

individual vanity by attempting on the most frivolous pretexts to cancel the
terms established by original discoverers, and to substitute a new and un-
authorized nomenclature in their place. One author lays down as a rule,
that no specific names should be derived from geographical sources, and un-
hesitatingly proceeds to insert words of his own in all such cases ; another
declares war against names of exotic origin, foreign to the Greek and Latin ;
a third excommunicates all words which exceed a certain number of sylla-
bles ; a fourth cancels all names which are complimentary of individuals, and
so on, till universality and permanence, the two great essentials of scientific

 language, are utterly destroyed.

     It is surely, then, an object well worthy the attention of the Zoological
 Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, to devise

some means which may lessen the extent of this evil, if not wholly put an
 end to it. The best method of making the attempt seems to be, to entrust

 to a carefully selected committee the preparation of a series of rules, the
 adoption of which must be left to the sound sense of naturalists in general.

 By emanating from the British Association, it is hoped that the proposed
 rules will be invested with an authority which no individual zoologist, how-
 ever eminent, could confer on them. The world of science is no longer a
 monarchy, obedient to the ordinances, however just, of an Aristotle or a Lin-
 nseus. She has now assumed the form of a republic, and although this revo-
 lution may have increased the vigour and zeal of her followers, yet it has de-
 stroyed much of her former order and regularity of government. The latter
 can only be restored by framing such laws as shall be based in reason and
--108 REPORT 1842.

sanctioned by the approval of men of science ; and it is to the preparation of

these laws that the Zoological Section of the Association have been invited

to give their aid.
    In venturing to propose these rules for the guidance of all classes of zoolo-

gists in all countries, we disclaim any intention of dictating to men of science
the course which they may see fit to pursue. It must of course be always at
the option of authors to adhere to or depart from these principles, but. we
offer them to the candid consideration of zoologists, in the hope that they
may lead to sufficient uniformity of method in future to rescue the science

from becoming a mere chaos of words.'

  We now proceed to develope the details of our plan ; and in order to make

the reasons by which we are guided apparent to naturalists at large, it will be

requisite to append to each proposition a short explanation of the circum-

stances which call for it.

   Among the numerous rules for nomenclature which have been proposed by
naturalists, there are many which, though excellent in themselves, it is not
now desirable to enforce*. The cases in which those rules have been over-

looked or departed from, are so numerous and of such long standing, that to
carry these regulations into effect would undermine the edifice of zoological
nomenclature. But while we do not adopt these propositions as authoritative

laws, they may still be consulted with advantage in making such additions to
the language of zoology as are required by the progress of the science. By
adhering to sound principles of philology, we may avoid errors in future,
even when it is too late to remedy the past, and the language of science will
thus eventually assume an aspect of more classic purity than it now presents.

   Our subject hence divides itself into two parts ; the first consisting of Hides
for the rectification of the present zoological nomenclature, and the second of
Recommendations for the improvement of zoological nomenclature in future.

PART I.

RULES FOR RECTIFYING THE PRESENT NOMENCLATURE.

[Limitation of the Plan to Systematic Nomenclature.']

In proposing a measure for the establishment of a permanent and universal

zoological nomenclature, it must be premised that we refer solely to the Latin
Weor systematic language of zoology.
                                      have nothing to do with vernacular

appellations. One great cause of the neglect and corruption which prevails

in the scientific nomenclature of zoology, has been the frequent ffnd often

exclusive use of vernacular names in lieu of the Latin binomial designations,

which form the only legitimate language of systematic zoology. Let us then
endeavour to render perfect the Latin or Linna?an method of nomenclature,
which, being far removed from the scope of national vanities and modern
antipathies, holds out the only hope of introducing into zoology that grand

desideratum, an universal language.

\_Law of Priority the only effectual andjust one.]

   It being admitted on all hands that words are only the conventional signs
of ideas, it is evident that language can only attain its end effectually by

being permanently established and generally recognized. This consideration
ought, it would seem, to have checked those who are continually attempting
to subvert the established language of zoology by substituting terms of their
own coinage. But, forgetting the true nature of language, they persist in

   * See especially the admirable code proposed in the ' PhilosopMa Botanica ' of Linnaeus. If
zoologists had paid more attention to the principles of that code, the present attempt at

reform would perhaps have been unnecessary.
ON ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.  109

confounding the name of a species or group with its definition ; and because
the former often falls short of the fullness of expression found in the latter,
they cancel it without hesitation, and introduce some new term which ap-
pears to them more characteristic, but which is utterly unknown to the science,
and is therefore devoid of all authority*. If these persons were to object to
such names of men as Long, Little, Armstrong, Golightly, &c, in cases where
they fail to apply to the individuals who bear them, or should complain of
the names Gough, Laiurence, or Harvey, that they were devoid of meaning,
and should hence propose to change them for more characteristic appella-
tions, they would not act more unphilosophically or inconsiderately than they
do in the case before us ; for, in truth, it matters not in the least by what
conventional sound we agree to designate an individual object, provided the
sign to be employed be stamped with such an authority as will suffice to

make it pass current. Now in zoology no one person can subsequently claim

an authority equal to that possessed by the person who is the first to define a
new genus or describe a new species ; and hence it is that the name origin-
ally given, even though it may be inferior in point of elegance or express-

iveness to those subsequently proposed, ought as a general principle to be

permanently retained. To this consideration we ought to add the injustice
of erasing the name originally selected by the person to whose labours we
owe our first knowledge of the object ; and we should reflect how much the

permission of such a practice opens a door to obscure pretenders for dragging
themselves into notice at the expense of original observers. Neither can an
author be permitted to alter a name which he himself has once published,
except in accordance with fixed and equitable laws. It is well observed by

Decandolle, " L'auteur meme qui a le premier etabli un nom n'a pas plus
qu'un autre le droit de le changer pour simple cause d'impropriete. La pri-

orite en effet est un terme fixe, positif, qui n'admet rien, ni d'arbitraire, ni
de partial."

   For these reasons, we have no hesitation in adopting as our fundamental
maxim, the " law of priority," viz.

   § 1. The name originally given by the founder of a group or the

describer of a species should be permanently retained, to the exclu-
sion of all subsequent synonyms (with the exceptions about to be

noticed).

   Having laid down this principle, we must next inquire into the limitations

which are found necessary in carrying it into practice.

                      [Not to extend to authors older than Linn&us.~\

   As our subject matter is strictly confined to the binomial system of nomen-
clature, or that which indicates species by means of two Latin words, the one
generic, the other specific, and as this invaluable method originated solely
with Linnaeus, it is clear that, as far as species are concerned, we ought not
to attempt to carry back the principle of priority beyond the date of the
12th edition of the ' Systema Naturae.' Previous to that period, naturalists
were wont to indicate species not by a name comprised in one word, but
by a definition which occupied a sentence, the extreme verbosity of which
method was productive of great inconvenience. It is true that one word
sometimes sufficed for the definition of a species, but these rare cases were
only binomial by accident and not by principle, and ought not therefore in
any instance to supersede the binomial designations imposed by Linnaeus.

   * Limifeiis says on this subject, " Ahstinenduni ah hac inuovatione quae nunquaitf cessa-
ret, quin indies aptiora detegerentur ad infinitum."
                                                                     ------

110 REPORT-- 1842.

   The same reasons apply also to generic names. Linnaeus was the first to
attacli a definite value to genera, and to give them a systematic character by
moans of exact definitions; and therefore although the names used by pre-
vious authors may often be applied with propriety to modern genera, yet in
such eases they acquire a new moaning, and should be quoted on the author-
ity of the first person who used them in this secondary sense. It is true,
that several of the old authors made occasional approaches to the Linnaeau
exactness of generic definition, but still these were but partial attempts ; and
it is certain that if in our rectification of the binomial nomenclature we once
trace back our authorities into the obscurity which preceded the epoch of
its foundation, we shall find no resting-place or fixed boundary for our re-
searches. The nomenclature of Ray is chiefly derived from that of Gesner
and Aldrovandus, and from these authors we might proceed backward to
/Elian, Pliny, and Aristotle, till our zoological studies would be frittered

away amid the refinements of classical learning*.

  We therefore recommend the adoption of the following proposition :

   § 2. The binomial nomenclature having originated with Linnaeus,

the law of priority, in respect of that nomenclature, is not to extend to

the writings of antecedent authors.
    [It should be here explained, that Brisson, who was a contemporary of

Linnaeus and acquainted with the ' Systema Naturae,' defined and published
certain genera of' birds which are additional to those in the 12th edition of
Linnreus's work, and which are therefore of perfectly good authority. But
Brisson still adhered to the old mode of designating species by a sentence
instead of a word, and therefore while we retain his defined genera, we do
not extend the same indulgence to the titles of his species, even when the
latter are accidentally binomial in form. For instance, the Pcrdix rubra, of
Brisson is the Tetrao rufus of Linnaeus ; therefore as we in this case retain the
generic name of Brisson and the specific name of Linnaeus, the correct title
of the species would be Perdix rufa.~\

          [ Generic names not to be cancelled in subsequent subdivisions.']

   As the number of known species which form the groundwork of zoological
science is always increasing, and our knowledge of their structure becomes
more complete, fresh generalizations continually occur to the naturalist, and
the number of genera and other groups requiring appellations is ever be-
coming more extensive. It thus becomes necessary to subdivide the contents
of old groups and to make their definitions continually more restricted. In

carrying out this process, it is an act of justice to the original author, that
his generic name should never be lost sight of; and it is no less essential to
the welfare of the science, that all which is sound in its nomenclature should
remain unaltered amid the additions which are continually being made to it.

On this ground we recommend the adoption of the following rule :
   § 3. A. generic name when once established should never be can-

celled in any subsequent subdivision of the group, but retained in a

restricted sense for one of the constituent portions.

[Genei'ic  names  to  be  retainedfor  the  typical portion  of the  old genus.
                                                                                                              ~\

When a genus is subdivided into other genera, the original name should

be retained for that portion of it which exhibits in the greatest degree its

essential characters as at first defined. Authors frequently indicate this by

selecting some one species as a fixed point of reference, which they term the

* " Quis longo a?vo recepta vocabula commutaret hodic cum patrum?" Linnaus.
----

ON ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.  Ill

" type of the genus." When they omit doing so, it may still in many cases

be correctly inferred that the first species mentioned on their list, if found
accurately to agree with their definition, was regarded by them as the type.

A specific name or its synonyms will also often serve to point out the parti-

cular species which by implication must be regarded as the original type of a
genus. In such cases we are justified in restoring the name of the old genus

Weto its typical signification, even when later authors have done otherwise.

submit therefore that

   § 4. The generic name should always be retained for that portion
of the original genus which was considered typical by the author.

 --Example. The genus Picumnus was established by Temminck, and in-

cluded two groups, one with four toes, the other with three, theformer of which
was regarded by the author as typical. Swainson, however, in raising these
groups at a later period to the rank of genera, gave a new name, Asthenurus,
to the former group, and retained Picumnus for the latter. In this case we
have no choice but to restore the name Picumnus, Tem., to its correct sense,
cancelling the^name Asthenurus, Sw., and imposing a new name on the 3-toed
group which Swainson had called Picumnus.

[_ Wlien no type is indicated, then the original name is to be kept for that sub-
                           sequent subdivision which first received it.~\

   Our next proposition seems to require no explanation :

   § 5. When the evidence as to the original type of a genus is not

perfectly clear and indisputable, then the person who first subdivides
the genus may affix the original name to any portion of it at his dis-
cretion, and no later author has a right to transfer that name to any

other part of the original genus.

     \_A later name of the same extent as an earlier to be wholly cancelled.^

   When an author infringes the law of priority by giving a new name to a
genus which has been properly defined and named already, the only penalty

which can be attached to this act of negligence or injustice, is to expel the
name so introduced from the pale of the science. It is not right then in
such cases to restrict the meaning of the later name so that it may stand side
by side with the earlier one, as has sometimes been done. For instance, the
genus Monaulus, Vieill. 1816, is a precise equivalent to Lophophorus, Tem.
1813, both authors having adopted the same species as their type, and there-
fore when the latter genus came in the course of time to be divided into two,
it was incorrect to give the condemned name Monaulus to one of the por-
tions. To state this succinctly,

   § 6. When two authors define and name the same genus, both

making it exactly of the same extent, the later name should be can-
celled in toto, and not retained in a modified sense*.

    This rule admits of the following exception :

    § 7» Provided however, that if these authors select their respective
types from different sections of the genus, and these sections be after-

wards raised into genera, then both these names may be retained in
a restricted sense for the new genera respectively.

  --Example. The names (Edemia and Melanetta were originally co-exten-

   * These discarded names may however he tolerated, if they have heen afterwards pro-
posed in a totally new sense, though we trust that in future no one will knowingly apply an
old name, whether now adopted or not, to a new genus. (See proposition g, infra.)

--112 REPORT 1842.

sive synonyms, but their respective types were taken from different sections
which are now raised into genera, distinguished by the above titles.

   [No special rule is required for the cases in which the later of two generic
names is so defined as to be less extensive in signification than the earlier, for

if the later includes the type of the earlier genus, it would be cancelled by
the operation of § 4- ; and if it does not include that type, it is in fact a distinct
genus.]

   But when the later name is more extensive than the earlier, the following

rule conies into operation :

       \_A later name equivalent to several earlier ones is to be cancelled.']

   The same principle which is involved in § 6, will apply to § 8.
   § S. If the later name be so defined as to be equal in extent to two

--or more previously published genera, it must be cancelled in toto.
   Example. Psarocolius, Wagl. iS'27, is equivalent to five or six genera
previously published under other names, therefore Psarocolius should be

cancelled.
    If these previously published genera be separately adopted (as is the case

with the equivalents of Psarocolius), their original names will of course pre-
vail; but if we follow the later author in combining them into one, the fol-
lowing rule is necessary :

\_A genus compounded of two or more previously/ proposed genera ivhosc cha-
 racters are now deemed insufficient, should retain the name of one of them.]

It sometimes happens that the progress of science requires two or more

genera, founded on insufficient or erroneous characters, to be combined to-

gether into one. In such cases the law of priority forbids us to cancel all

Wethe original names and impose a new one on this compound genus.  must

therefore select some one species as a type or example, and give the generic

name which it formerly bore to the whole group now formed. If these ori-

ginal generic names differ in date, the oldest one should be the one adopted.

§ 9. In compounding a genus out of several smaller ones, the earli-

est of them, if otherwise unobjectionable, should be selected, and its

former generic name be extended over the new genus so compounded.

 --Example. The genera Accentor and Prunella of Vieillot not being con-

sidered sufficiently distinct in character, are now united under the general

name of Accentor-, that being the earliest. So also Cerithium and Potamides,

which were long considered distinct, are now united, and the latter name

merges into the former.

  We now proceed to point out those few cases which form exceptions to

the law of priority, and in which it becomes both justifiable and necessary to

alter the names originally imposed by authors.

[A name shoidd be changed ivhen previously applied to another group which

                                                          still retains it.]

   It being essential to the binomial method to indicate objects in natural
history by means of tico ivords only, without the aid of any further designa-
tion, it follows that a generic name should only have one meaning, in other
words, that two genera should never bear the same name. For a similar

reason, no two species in the same genus should bear the same name. When

these cases occur, the later of the two duplicate names should be cancelled,

and a new term, or the earliest synonym, if there be any, substituted. When
it is necessary to form new words for this purpose, it is desirable to make

them bear some analogy to those which they are destined to supersede, as
       ON ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.                                 113

where the genus of birds, Plectorhynchus, being preoccupied in Ichthyology,

is changed to Pleclorhamphus. It is, we conceive, the bounden duty of an

author when naming a new genus, to ascertain by careful search that the

name which he proposes to employ has not been previously adopted in other

departments of natural history*. By neglecting this precaution he is liable

to have the name altered and his authority superseded by the first subsequent

author who may detect the oversight, and for this result, however unfortu-

nate, we fear there is no remedy, though such cases would be less frequent

if the detectors of these errors would, as an act of courtesy, point them out

to the author himself, if living, and leave it to him to correct his own inad-

vertencies. This occasional hardship appears to us to be a less evil than to

permit the practice of giving the same generic name ad libitum to a multi-

Weplicity of genera.  submit therefore, that                       ,

A§ 10. name should be changed which has before been proposed

for some other genus in zoology or botany, or for some other species

in the same genus, when still retained for such genus or species.

       [A name whose meaning is glaringly false may be changed."]

    Our next proposition has no other claim for adoption than that of being a
 concession to human infirmity. If such proper names of places as Covent
 Garden, Lincoln's Inn Fields, Newcastle, Bridgewater, &c, no longer sug-

 gest the ideas of gardens, fields, castles, or bridges, but refer the mind with the
 quickness of thought to the particular localities which they respectively de-
 signate, there seems no reason why the proper names used in natural history
 should not equally perform the office of correct indication even when their
 etymological meaning may be wholly inapplicable to the object which they
 typify. But we must remember that the language of science has but a limit-
 ed currency, and hence the words which compose it do not circulate with
 the same freedom and rapidity as those which belong to every-day life. The
 attention is consequently liable in scientific studies to be diverted from the
 contemplation of the thing signified to the etymological meaning of the sign,
 and hence it is necessary to provide that the latter shall not be such as to

 propagate actual error. Instances of this kind are indeed very rare, and in
 some cases, such as that of Monodon, Caprimulgus, Paradisea apoda and
 Monoculus, they have acquired sufficient currency no longer to cause error,
and are therefore retained without change. But when we find a Batrachian
reptile named in violation of its true affinities, Mastodonsaurus, a Mexican
species termed (through erroneous information of its habitat) Picus cafer, or
an olive-coloured one Muscicapa atra, or when a name is derived from an
 accidental monstrosity, as in Picus semirostris of Linnasus, and Helix dis-
juncta of Turton, we feel justified in cancelling these names, and adopting that
synonym which stands next in point of date. At the same time we think it
right to remark that this privilege is very liable to abuse, and ought there-

fore to be applied only to extreme cases and with great caution. With these
limitations we may concede that

   A§ 11. name may be changed when it implies a false proposition

which is likely to propagate important errors.

                     [_Names not clearly defined may be changed.']

   Unless a species or group is intelligibly defined when the name is given, it
cannot be recognized by others, and the signification of the name is conse-
quently lost. Two things are necessary before a zoological term can acquire

any authority, viz. definition and publication. Definition properly implies a

distinct exposition of essential characters, and in all cases we conceive this to
be indispensable, although some authors maintain that a mere enumeration of

the component species, or even of a single type, is sufficient to authenticate
a genus. To constitute publication, nothing short of the insertion of the

above particulars in a printed book can be held sufficient. Many birds, for

instance, in the Paris and other continental museums, shells in the British

Museum (in Dr. Leach's time), and fossils in the Scarborough and other

Mpublic collections, have received S. names which will be of no authority until

they are published*. Nor can any unpublished descriptions, however exact
(such as those of Forster, which are still shut up in a MS. at Berlin), claim
any right of priority till published, and then only from the date of their pub-
lication. The same rule applies to cases where groups or species are pub-
lished, but not defined, as in some museum catalogues, and in Lesson's ' Traite
d'Ornithologie,' where many species are enumerated by name, without any

description or reference by which they can be identified. Therefore

  A§ 12. name which has never been clearly defined, in some pub-

lished work should be changed for the earliest name by which the

object shall have been so defined.

[ Specific names, when adopted as generic, must be cltanged.~\

The necessity for the following rule will be best illustrated by an example.

The Corvns pyrrhocorax, Linn., was afterwards advanced to a genus under

the name of Pyrrhocorax. Temminck adopts this generic name, and also

retains the old specific one, so that he terms the species Pyrrhocorax pyr-

rhocorax. The inelegance of this method is so great as to demand a change

of the specific name, and the species now stands as Pyrrhocorax alpinus,

WeVieill.  propose therefore that

§ 13. Anew specific name must be given to a species when its old

name has been adopted for a genus which includes that species.

N.B. It will be seen, however, below, that we strongly object to the

further continuance of this practice of elevating specific names into generic.

           \_Latin orthography to be adhered to.~]

On the subject of orthography it is necessary to lay down one proposition,

§ 14. In writing zoological names the rules of Latin orthography-

must be adhered to.

In Latinizing Greek words there are certain rules of orthography known

to classical scholars which must never be departed from. For instance, the

names which modern authors have written Aipunemia, Zenophasia, poioce-

phala, must, according to the laws of etymology, be spelt JEpycnemia, Xeno-

phasia and pceocephala. In Latinizing modern words the rules of classic

usage do not apply, and all that we can do is to give to such terms as clas-

sical an appearance as we can, consistently with the preservation of their

etymology. In the case of European words Avl\ose orthography is fixed, it is

best to retain the original form, even though it may include letters and com-

binations unknown in Latin.  Such words, for instance,  as  Woodward
                                                                                                 i,

Knighti, Bullochi, Eschscholtzi, would be quite unintelligible if they were

Latinized into Vudvardi, Cnichti, Bullocci, Essolzi, &c. But words of bar-

barous origin, having no fixed orthography, are more pliable, and hence,

when adopted into the Latin, they should be rendered as classical in appcar-

   * These MS. names are in all cases liable to create confusion, and it is therefore much to
be desired that the practice of using tlieni should be avoided iu future.

116 REPORT-- 1842.

   § A. The best zoological names are those which are derived from
the Latin or Greek, and express some distinguishing characteristic of

the object to which they are applied.

[Classes of objectionable names.~\

It follows from hence that the following classes of words are more or less

objectionable in point of taste, though, in the case of genera, it is often neces-

sary to use them, from the impossibility of finding characteristic words which

Wehave not before been employed for other genera.        will commence with

those which appear the least open to objection, such as

   a. Geographical names These words being for the most part adjectives
can rarely be used for genera. As designations of species they have been so

strongly objected to, that some authors (Wagler, for instance) have gone the

length of substituting fresh names wherever they otcur ; others (e.g. Swain-

son) will only tolerate them where they apply exclusively, as Lepus hiberni-

Wecus, Troglodytes europceus, &c.  are by no means disposed to go to this

length. It is not the less true that the Hirundo javanica is a Javanese bird,

even though it may occur in other countries also, and though other species of

Hirundo may occur in Java. The utmost that can be urged against such

words is, that they do not tell the whole truth. However, as so many authors

object to this class of names, it is better to avoid giving them, except where

there is reason to believe that the species is chiefly confined to the country

whose name it bears.

 --b. Barbarous names. Some authors protest strongly against the introduc-

tion of exotic words into our Latin nomenclature, others defend the practice

Wewith equal warmth.  may remark, first, that the practice is not contrary

to classical usage, for the Greeks and Romans did occasionally, though with

reluctance, iutroduce barbarous words in a modified form into their respective

languages. Sec&ndly, the preservation of the trivial names which animals

bear in their native countries is often of great use to the traveller in aiding

Wehim to discover and identify species.  do not therefore consider, if such

words have a Latin termination given to them, that the occasional and judi-

--cious use of them as scientific terms can be justly objected to.
   c. Technical names. All words expressive of trades and professions have

been by some writers excluded from zoology, but without sufficient reason.

Words of this class, when carefully chosen, often express the peculiar charac-

ters and habits of animals in a metaphorical manner, which is highly elegant.

We may cite the generic terms Arvicola, Lanius, Pastor, Tyrannus, Reguhis,

Mimus, Ploceus, &c, as favourable examples of this class of names.

 --d. Mythological or historical names. When these have no perceptible re-

ference or allusion to the characters of the object on which they are conferred,

they may be properly regarded as unmeaning and in bad taste. Thus the

generic names Lesbia, Leilus, Remus, Corydon, Pasiphae, have been applied

to a Humming bird, a Butterfly, a Beetle, a Parrot, and a Crab respectively,
without any perceptible association of ideas. But mythological names may

sometimes be used as generic with the same propriety as technical ones, in

cases where a direct allusion can be traced between the narrated actions of a

personage and the observed habits or structure of an animal. Thus when the
name Prognc is given to a Swallow, Clotho to a Spider, Hydra to a Polyp,

Athene to an Owl, Nestor to a grey-headed Parrot, &c, a pleasing and bene-

--ficial connexion is established between classical literature and physical science.
   e. Comparative names. The objections which have been raised to words
of this class are not without foundation. The names, no less than the defini-

tions of objects, should, where practicable, be drawn from positive and self-
ON ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.  117

 evident Characters, and not from a comparison with other objects, which may
 be less known to the reader than the one before him. Specific names expres-
 sive of comparative size are also to be avoided, as they may be rendered in-
 accurate by the after-discovery of additional species. The names Picoides,

 Emberizoides, Pseudoluscinia, rubecidoides, maximus, minor, minimus, &c. are

 examples of this objectionable practice.

  --f. Generic names compounded from other genera. These are in some de-

 gree open to the same imputation as comparative words ; but as they often
 serve to express the position of a genus as intermediate to, or allied with, two
 other genera, they may occasionally be used with advantage. Care must be
 taken not to adopt such compound words as are of too great length, and not
 to corrupt them in trying to render them shorter. The names Gallopavo, Te-
 traogallus, Gypaetos, are examples of the appropriate use of compound words.

  --g. Specific names derived from persons. So long as these complimentary

 designations are used with moderation, and are restricted to persons of emi-
nence as scientific zoologists, they may be employed with propriety in cases
where expressive or characteristic words are not to be found. But we fully
concur with those who censure the practice of naming species after persons

 of no scientific reputation, as curiosity dealers (e. g. Caniveti, Boissoneauti),
 Peruvian priestesses (Cora, Amazilid), or Hottentots {Klassi).

  --h. Generic names derived from persons. Words of this class have been

very extensively used in botany, and therefore it would have been well to
have excluded them wholly from zoology, for the sake of obtaining a memo-
ria technica by which the name of a genus would at once tell us to which of
the kingdoms of nature it belonged. Some few personal generic names have
however crept into zoology, as Cuvieria, Mulleria, JRossia, Lessonia, &c, but

they are very rare in comparison with those of botany, and it is perhaps de-
sirable not to add to their number.

  --i. Names of harsh and inelegant pronunciation. These words are grating

to the ear, either from inelegance of form, as Huhua, Yuhina, Craxirex, Esch-
scholtzi,. or from too great length, as chirostrongylostinus, Opetiorhynchus,

brachypodioides, Thecodontosaurus, not to mention the Enaliolimnosauras

crocodilocephaloides of a German naturalist. It is needless to enlarge on the
advantage of consulting euphony in the construction of our language. As a
general rule it may be recommended to avoid introducing words of more than

five syllables.

  --h. Ancient names of animals applied in a wrong sense. It has been cus-

tomary, in numerous cases, to apply the names of animals found in classic
authors at random to exotic genera or species which were wholly unknown
to the ancients. The names Cebus, Callithrix, Spiza, Kitta, Struthus, are
examples. This practice ought by no means to be encouraged. The usual
defence for it is, that it is impossible now to identify the species to which the
name was anciently applied. But it is certain that if any traveller will take
the trouble to collect the vernacular names used by the modern Greeks and
Italians for the Vertebrata and Mollusca of southern Europe, the meaning of
the ancient names may in most cases be determined with the greatest preci-
sion. It has been well remarked that a Cretan fisher-boy is a far better com-
mentator on Aristotle's ' History of Animals' than a British or German scho-
lar. The use however of ancient names, wlien correctly applied, is most de-
sirable, for " in framing scientific terms, the appropriation of old words is
preferable to the formation of new ones*."

 --I. Adjective generic names. The names of genera are, in all cases, essen-

tially substantive, and hence adjective terms cannot be employed for them

without doing violence to grammar. The generic names Hians, Criniger,

  m. Hybrid names Compound words, whose compouent parts are taken

laid down, that when a name is introduced which is identical with one pre-

viously used, the later one should be changed. Some authors have extended

the same principle to cases where the later name, when correctly written, only

Weapproaches in form, without wholly coinciding with the earlier.  do not,

however, think it advisable to make this law imperative, first, because of the

vast extent of our nomenclature, which renders it highly difficult to find a

name which shall not bear more or less resemblance in sound to some other

and, secondly, because of the impossibility of fixing a limit to the degree of

Weapproximation beyond which such a law should cease to operate.    con-

tent ourselves, therefore, with putting forth this proposition merely as a re-

commendation to naturalists, in selecting generic names, to avoid such as too

closely approximate words already adopted. So with respect to species, the

judicious naturalist will aim at variety of designation, and will not, for ex-

ample, call a species virens or virescens in a genus which already possesses a

--viridis.
   o. Corrupted words. In the construction of compound Latin words, there

are certain grammatical rules which have been known and acted on for two

thousand years, and which a naturalist is bound to acquaint himself with be-

fore he tries his skill in coining zoological terms. One of the chief of these

rules is, that in compounding words all the radical or essential parts of the

constituent members must be retained, and no change made except in the

variable terminations. But several generic names have been lately introduced

which run counter to this rule, and form most unsightly objects to all who are

Aconversant with the spirit of the Latin language.  name made up of the

first half of one word and the last half of another, is as deformed a monster

in nomenclature as a Mermaid or a Centaur would be in zoology ; yet we find
examples in the names Corcorax (from Corvus and Pyrrhocorax), Cypsnagra

(from Cypselus and Tanagra), Merulaxis (Merula and Synallaxis), Loxigilla

(Loxia and Fringilla), &c. In other cases, where the commencement of both

the simple words is retained in the compound, a fault is still committed by

cutting off too much of the radical and vital portions, as is the case in Bu-

corvus (from Buceros and Corvus), Ninox (Nisus and Noctua), &c.

p. Nonsense names.-- Some authors having found difficulty in selecting ge-

neric names which have not been used before, have adopted the plan of coining

words at random without any derivation or meaning whatever. The following

are examples : Viralva, Xemu, Azeca, Assiminia, Quedius, Spisula. To the

same class we may refer anagrams of other generic names, as Dacelo and Ce-

dola of Alcedo, Zapornia of Porzana, &c. Such verbal trifling as this is in

very bad taste, and is especially calculated to bring the science into contempt.
It finds no precedent in the Augustan age of Latin, but can be compared only
to the puerile quibblings of the middle ages. It is contrary to the genius of
all languages, which appear never to produce new words by spontaneous ge-
neration, but always to derive them from some other source, however distant

or obscure. And it is peculiarly annoying to the etymologist, who after seek"
ON ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.                             119

ing in vain through the vast storehouses of human language for the parentage

of such words, discovers at last that he has been pursuing an ignis fatuus.

 --q. Names previously cancelled by the operation of § 6. Some authors con-

sider that when a name has been reduced to a synonym by the operations of
the laws of priority, they are then at liberty to apply it at pleasure to any new

group which may be in want of a name. We consider, however, that when a

word has once been proposed in a given sense, and has afterwards sunk into
a synonym, it is far better to lay it aside for ever than to run the risk of ma-

--king confusion by re-issuing it with a new meaning attached.
   r. Specific names raised into generic. It has sometimes been the practice
in subdividing an old genus to give to the lesser genera so formed, the names
of their respective typical species. Our Rule 13 authorizes the forming a
new specific name in such cases ; but we further wish to state our objections
to the practice altogether. Considering as we do that the original specific
names should as far as possible be held sacred, both on the grounds of justice
to their authors and of practical convenience to naturalists, Ave would strongly
dissuade from thefurther continuance of a practice which is gratuitous in itself,
and which involves the necessity of altering long-established specific names.

  We have now pointed out the principal rocks and shoals which lie in the

path of the nomenclator; and it will be seen that the navigation through
them is by no means easy. The task of constructing a language which shall
supply the demands of scientific accuracy on the one hand, and of literary

elegance on the other, is not to be inconsiderately undertaken by unqualified
persons. Our nomenclature presents but too many flaws and inelegancies

already, and as the stern law of priority forbids their removal, it follows that

they must remain as monuments of the bad taste or bad scholarship of their

authors to the latest ages in which zoology shall be studied.

^Families to end in idse, and Subfamilies in inae.]

   The practice suggested in the following proposition has been adopted by
many recent authors, and its simplicity and convenience is so great that we
strongly recommend its universal use.

   § B. It is recommended that the assemblages of genera termed fa-
milies should be uniformly named by adding the termination idee to
the name of the earliest known, or most typically characterized genus
in them ; and that their subdivisions, termed subfamilies, should be

similarly constructed, with the termination ince.
    These words are formed by changing the last syllable of the genitive case

into idee or inec, as Strix, Strigis, Strigidee, Buceros, Bucerotis, Bucerotidee,

not Strixidce, Buceridai.

\_Specific names to be written with a small initial.']

A convenient memoria technica may be effected by adopting our next pro-

position. It has been usual, when the titles of species are derived from pro-
per names, to write them with a capital letter, and hence when the specific

name is used alone it is liable to be occasionally mistaken for the title of a

genus. But if the titles of species were invariably written with a small ini-

tial, and those of genera with a capital, the eye would at once distinguish the

rank of the group referred to, and a possible source of error would be avoided.

It should be further remembered that all species are equal, and should there-

Wefore be written all alike.  suggest, then, that

   § C. Specific names should always be written with a small initial
letter, even when derived from persons or places, and generic names

should be always written with a capital.

[ The authority for a species, exclusive of the genus, to be followed by a di~

                                                    stinctive expression.]

   The systematic names of zoology being still far from that state of fixity
which is the ultimate aim of the science, it is frequently necessary for correct
indication to append to them the name of the person on whose authority they
have been proposed. When the same person is authority both for the specific
and generic name, the case is very simple ; but when the specific name of one
author is annexed to the generic name of another, some difficulty occurs.
For example, the Muscicapa crinita of Linnaeus belongs to the modern genus
Tyrannies of Vieillot ; but Swainson was the first tp apply the specific name
of Linnaeus to the generic one of Vieillot. The question now arises, Whose
authority is to be quoted for the name Tyrannus crinitus? The expression
Tyrannus crinitus, Lin., would imply what is untrue, for Linnaeus did not use
the term Tyrannus ; and Tyrannus crinitus, Vieill., is equally incorrect, for
Vieillot did not adopt the name crinitus. If we call it Tyrannus crinitus,
Sw., it would imply that Swainson was the first to describe the species, and
Linnaeus would be robbed of his due credit. If we term it Tyrannus, Vieill.,
crinitus, Lin., we use a form which, though expressing the facts correctly, and
therefore not without advantage in particular cases where great exactness is
required, is yet too lengthy and inconvenient to be used with ease and rapi-
dity. Of the three persons concerned with the construction of a binomial
title in the case before us, we conceive that the author who first describes
and names a species which forms the gi'oundwork of later generalizations,
possesses a higher claim to have his name recorded than he who afterwards
defines a genus which is found to embrace that species, or who may be the
mere accidental means of bringing the generic and specific names into con-
tact. By giving the authority for the specific name in preference to all others,

the inquirer is referred directly to the original description, habitat, &c. of the
species, and is at the same time reminded of the date of its discovery ; while

genera, being less numerous than species, may be carried in the memory, or

referred to in systematic works without the necessity of perpetually quoting
their authorities. The most simple mode then for ordinary use seems to be
to append to the original authority for the species, when not applying to the
genus also, some distinctive mark, such as (sp.) implying an exclusive refer-
ence to the specific name, as Tyrannus crinitus, Lin. (sp.), and to omit this
expression when the same authority attaches to both genus and species, as

Ostrea edulis, Lin.*' Therefore,

   § D. It is recommended that the authority for a specific name, when
not applying to the generic name also, should be followed by the di-

stinctive expression (sp.).

            \_Neio genera and species to be defined amply and publicly.]

  A large proportion of the complicated mass of synonyms which has now

become the opprobrium of zoology, has originated either from the slovenly
and imperfect manner in which species and groups have been originally de-
fined, or from their definitions having been inserted in obscure local publica-
tions which have never obtained an extensive circulation. Therefore, although
under § 12, we have conceded that mere insertion in a printed book is suffi-
cient for publication, yet we would strongly advise the authors of new groups
always to give in the first instance a full and accurate definition of their cha-
racters, and to insert the same in such periodical or other works as are likely
to obtain an immediate and extensive circulation. To state this briefly,

   * The expression Tyrannus crinitus (Lin.) would perhaps be preferable from its greater

brevity.

   § E. It is recommended that new genera or species be amply de-
fined, and extensively circulated in the first instance.

 f_

                                                       original genus.~\

   In order'to preserve specific names as far us possible in an unaltered form,
whatever may be the changes which the genera to which they are referred
may undergo, it is desirable, when it can be done with propriety, to make
the new subdivisions of genera agree in gender with the old groups from which
they are formed. This recommendation does not however authorize the
changing the gender or termination of a genus already established. In brief,

   § F. It is recommended that in subdividing an old genus in future,
the names given to the subdivisions should agree in gender with that

of the original group.

                 [Etymologies and types of new genera to be stated.
   It is obvious that the names of genera would in general be far more care-
fully constructed, and their definitions would be rendered more exact, if
authors would adopt the following suggestion :
   § G. It is recommended that in defining new genera the etymo-
logy of the name should be always stated, and that one species should
be invariably selected as a type or standard of reference.

In concluding this outline of a scheme for the rectification of zoological

nomenclature, we have only to remark, that almost the whole of the proposi-

tions contained in it may be applied with equal correctness to the sister sci-

Weence of botany.  have preferred, however, in this essay to limit our views

to zoology, both for the sake of rendering the question less complex, and be-

cause we conceive that the botanical nomenclature of the present day stands

in much less need of distinct enactment than the zoological. The admirable

rules laid down by Linnaeus, Smith, Decandolle, and other botanists (to

which, no less than to the works of Fabricius, Illiger, Vigors, Swainson, and

other zoologists, we have been much indebted in preparing the present docu-

ment), have always exercised a beneficial influence over their disciples.

Hence the language of botany has attained a more perfect and stable condi-

tion than that of zoology ; and if this attempt at reformation may have the

effect of advancing zoological nomenclature beyond its present backward

and abnormal state, the wishes of its promoters will be fully attained.

Report of a Committee of the British Association for the Advancement

   of Science, consisting of Lieut.-Colonel W. H. Sykes, F.R.S., Lord
   Sandon, M.P., G. R. Porter, Esq., F.R.S., J. Heywood, Esq.,
  F.R.S., Dr. W. P. Alison, and E. Chadwick, Esq., on the Vital

   Statistics of large Towns in Scotland.

Your Committee, in pursuance of the Resolution of the General Committee

of the Association in 1840, at Glasgow, selected the towns of Edinburgh
(with Leith), Glasgow, Aberdeen, Perth and Dundee, as best suited for their

inquiries, from their population, the occupations of their inhabitants, and
122 REPORT-- 1842.

their local positions, not only as affording data for useful comparison be-

tween towns having a common character, but also between those with dif-
ferences in their social organization or in their physical circumstances. Mr.
Alexander Watt of Glasgow, who has established a claim to public respect
by his Mortality Bills of Glasgow and other statistical works, was good
enough to undertake the severe labour of accumulating the facts which con-
stitute the present Report. From the very imperfect state of the Registers

of Marriages, Births and Deaths in Scotland, it required no ordinary perse-
verance and tact to obviate the deficiencies; but Mr. Watt's zeal enabled him
to surmount all difficulties, and he presented to the Committee a series of facts
absolutely embarrassing from their amount and elaborate and detailed cha-
racter. Mr. Watt's facts were comprised in 119 tables, and in the state in
which they were presented it was found that, together with the text, the re-
port would occupy 199 pages of the annual volume of the Association, a por-
tion of the volume which the Committee felt they ought not to desire to have
appropriated to their report. With this feeling a re-arrangement of the tables
and text was attempted, and by new modelling, dove-tailing and trifling omis-
sions of certain columns in the tables, and by some omissions and reconstruc-
tion of a few paragraphs in the text, the tables have been reduced to eighty
in number, and the pages occupied by the report will not exceed eighty-seven.
It is believed that these alterations have been effected without the omission
of any important facts; it certainly has been effected without the omission of
one of the original tables, although it must be admitted that certain columns
have been left out in the marriage tables to which Mr. Watt attaches some
weight ; and in justice to him this explanation is made. But the marriage
tables, as a whole, are necessarily imperfect, and the omission therefore of
details intended to explain the elements of the totals in the marriage tables
it was thought might be made without injury. The original manuscript,
however, of the report will be deposited in the archives of the British Asso-
ciation, and will be available to those whq may be desirous of instituting
comparisons between it and the printed report.

    While the sheets of this report were passing through the press, the Fourth
Annual Report of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in
England was presented to Parliament. As it contained later information than

that on which the tables for English towns, LXXV., LXXVII., LXXIX. and
LXXX. of this report, had been originally founded, it was thought right,

with a view to insure greater accuracy, to substitute the present tables of
the mortality in England for the former tables. The elements for determin-

ing the averages in tables LXXV., LXXVII, and LXXIX., are supplied by
the Registrar-General's report ; and table LXXX., containing the proportion

of deaths to the population in certain English towns, has been copied from
the same report. The English tables offer valuable standards of comparison
with those from the Scottish towns.

    The Committee close their Report on the Vital Statistics of large Towns
in Scotland with the expression of their regret that the want of a systematic
plan for the registration of marriages, births and deaths renders their report
less perfect than they could have desired ; nevertheless the facts accumu-
lated open out a prospect of ascertaining, in the continued progress of their
researches, certain physical laws in vital statistics, the knowledge of which
may be of considerable importance, not only in the formation of more cor-

rect estimates of the value of life in the different relations of society, but also
in guiding the judgement of the legislator and the philanthropist in encoun-
tering the physical evils resulting from moral causes.

MARRIAGES.

Till within these three years the amount of proclamations of marriages has

generally been given as the amount of marriages, both in the Glasgow and

Dundee mortality bills, the only towns in Scotland where attention has been

paid to the regular publication of bills of mortality. The preceding tables of

the proclamations of marriages for Edinburgh and Leith, Glasgow, Aberdeen,

Perth and Dundee, furnish sufficient evidence, that to assume the total num-

ber of the proclamations as the amount of marriages, in any case, is exceedingly

fallacious. For example, Table III. shows that in Edinburgh, in 1839, the

proclamations of marriages amounted to 1269, whereas the number of regular

Amarriages (Table I.) amounted only to 1026.  similar difference will be ob-

served between the amount of proclamations and the number of marriages du-

ring the several years for all these towns, arising from a number of the parties

residing in different parishes, in which cases there are two proclamations for

one marriage. The arrangement which ha3 been followed in these tables is

that lately adopted in the Glasgow mortality bills ; and, in the event of the
clergyman who celebrated the marriages, as well as the other parties con-

cerned, having adhered to their strict line of duty in enforcing the parties

married to produce the proper warrants of the proclamations of banns from

their respective parishes, the accuracy of the results in these tables is not to

be doubted. It is known, however, that several irregularities take place with

--regard to the fulfilment of the law, in relation to the proclamations of mar-

riages, a circumstance which necessarily produces some inaccuracy, however

slight, in the results brought out in the marriage tables.

   The proclamation fees are considerably lower in some parishes of Scotland

than in others, and parties have been known to make false statements of their

places of residence to escape paying the higher fee ; this has taken place
more especially in those cases where one of the parties resided in the parish

where the low fees are paid. In other cases this irregularity has taken place to

save the payment of double fees, which would be necessary, were the parties

proclaimed in their respective parishes as required by law. Cases are also
known in which ministers have married parties on the production of one

warrant, although the parties were known to have resided in different pa-

rishes ; so that marriages have taken place in a few instances where the warr

rants were not called for. On the other hand, some cases have occurred in

which the parties were not married although the warrants were called for.
These cases may therefore be considered as balancing each other ; and not-

withstanding these irregularities, the foregoing tables of marriages, con^

structed as they are from the returns made by the respective session clerks,

may be considered as nearer to the truth than any tables in other depart-

ments of vital statistics in Scotland, arising from the very defective and par-

tial system of registering births and deaths that exists in the country.

                                             Edinburgh.

   It will be found, that of the inhabitants of the city of Edinburgh, including
the parishes of St. Cuthbert's and the Canongate, the average annual number
of males married during the years 1839, 1840, and 1841 is 1009|, females
1050£ ; the total average annual number of individuals married during these
years being 2060.
ON THE VITAL STATISTICS OF LARGE TOWNS IN SCOTLAND. 135

Therefore the average annual number of males    1 to 60'725, or 1-646 per cent.
   married in Edinburgh, compared to the num-   1 to 73-185, or 1-366 per cent.
   ber of male inhabitants ascertained by the
   Census of 1841, is as                                           O280 per cent.

The average annual number of females mar-

    ried, to the female population, as
Greater proportion of the male than of the fe-

   male population married, by

   While there is on an average of these three years 0-280 per cent, more of the
male than of the female population of Edinburgh married, it appears that on the
average of these years there is 3*87 per cent, more females than males married*.

   The average annual number of individuals married, to the total population,

is as 1 to 67*078, or 1*490 per cent.
   It will be observed, that in the different tables of the proclamations of

marriages, it is assumed that all the females after marriage went to reside in
the parish to which their husbands belonged, and the females of the double
proclamations are accordingly deducted to obtain the amount of the resident

marriages. The following table is constructed on this principle.

difference in the amount of annual marriages in Perth and in Dundee, would
be of moment. These two towns are situated within twenty miles of each
other, with every facility of intercourse by coach and by steam-boat.

  A large proportion of the inhabitants of Perth are in easy and comfortable

circumstances ; and it will be observed, that the average annual amount of
marriages in that city for the last five years is 1 to 159*72, while in Dundee,
where there is a large proportion of poor and destitute people, as appears
from the great proportion of burials at the public expense, the average an-
nual amount of marriages for the last five years, to the mean population, is
asl to 111-42!

   In Edinburgh, exclusive of Leith, the average annual amount of marriages
for the last three years, to the mean population, is as 1 to 136*39, while in
Leith, with numerous poor, they are as 1 to 110*06 to the mean population of
these years. In Glasgow and suburbs, where a very large proportion of the
inhabitants is in destitute circumstances, arising from the influx of labour being
greater than the demand, and from other causes, the average annual amount
of marriages, to the mean population, for the last five years, is as 1 to 120*29.

   And in Aberdeen, where the poor and destitute bear a much smaller pro-

portion to the whole inhabitants than they do in Glasgow, the average an-
nual amount of resident marriages is as 1 to 140*00*. It would appear
from these observations, therefore, that in those towns where there is the
greatest amount of* poverty and destitution, and where, as will afterwards
appear, the mortality is greatest, the annual number of marriages is the
greatest. It is to be feared a moral law is here shadowed out, the result of
physical causes ; but we would not, however, be understood as coming at
once to this conclusion, although in accordance with other observations, as

there is much yet required to be done by the statist before we can arrive at
a full and accurate knowledge of the social condition of the inhabitants of
large towns in Scotland. Were the registers so kept that we could ascertain
the ages and occupations of the parties married, more light would be thrown

on this subject.
   The law for the regulation of marriages in England allows parties from a

distance, by a residence of eight days before marriage in any of the towns,
to be recorded in the Register of Marriages as inhabitants of the town.
This is understood frequently to take place, and more especially where one
of the parties is an inhabitant of the town ; consequently the amount of
marriages for some of these towns, as exhibited in the reports of the Regi-
strar-General, must appear greater than they really are ; and, compared with
those towns of Scotland for which the marriages are stated in the preceding
pages, would lead to inaccurate results. It would be desirable to ascertain
the amount of the male and of the female inhabitants married of each town
and district, which is not shown in the Registrar-General's reports, with a
view to give an accurate knowledge of the proportion of the marriages in
any given place to the population of that place. It is necessary to remark,
that in the preceding tables of marriages, instead of deriving our informa-
tion from the amount of marriages which take place, and which are nearly
as imperfectly recorded in some registers as the births, owing to the care-
lessness and inattention of the parties themselves, we were obliged to have
recourse to the records of the proclamations of marriages, to which, in all
cases of regular marriages in Scotland, both the parties married and the

    * It is also worthy of observation, that in Perth, on an average of years, there are an-
nually married 8§ more females than males ; in Dundee 15f more males than females ; in
Edinburgh 41£ more females than males ; in Leith 9g more males than females ; in Glasgow
204 more males than females ; and in Aberdeen If more females than males.

clergymen who celebrate the marriages, are bound by law strictly to ad-
here. Were records of marriages as strictly enforced as those of the pro-
clamations, we would have been enabled to avoid errors to which our present

statements are liable.

  A uniform and well-digested plan of registers for England, Scotland and

Ireland, and also for exhibiting the information deduced from them, would
obviously be of high importance ; and the results obtained by this uniform
plan, by showing the effects produced on the amount of births, marriages,
disease and death, by the condition of the people in different states of so-
ciety, whether of town or country, rich or poor, of sedentary or of laborious
employments, might ultimately lead to salutary laws for the amelioration of

the condition of the people.

   The system adopted in the registers of marriages in England, and the
mode of publishing the amount of individuals married in the large towns, do
not admit of an accurate comparison with the amount of individuals married
in towns similarly situated as to local circumstances in Scotland.

   The extent to which prudential motives operate on the respectable portion
of the mechanics and artizans of towns in prevention of early marriages,
appears to be considerable. The desire to establish themselves first in com-
fortably furnished houses is alone a sufficient check. But if we look to the con-

--dition of that numerous class of the inhabitants of towns who have sunk-

more especially of late years into a reckless state of poverty, and where the
prevalence of fever and other diseases, together with a limited supply of work
by which they can earn a livelihood, have reduced masses of them to an
extreme state of wretchedness, we shall find a very different feeling. In the
large towns of Scotland this wretchedness is known to exist not only from
personal inquiry, but it has been ably pointed out in late publications*.
So far from it operating as a check, the very hopelessness of their condition
would seem to make this class blind and callous to consequences ; and unions
are formed which ultimately can only enhance their sufferings.

   The importance of obtaining correct statistical information, therefore, as to
the amount of annual marriages among the different classes of society requires
no further illustration ; and though we are aware of the caution to be ob-
served in coming to any conclusion from the facts yet obtained and detailed
in the foregoing pages (imperfect as the system of registration may be from
which our data are obtained), yet these data prove that the greatest amount
of marriages is found to take place in those localities where the greatest
proportion of the wretchedly poor are congregated together ; and this fact
goes far to strengthen the opinion that the diminution of destitution, by

raising a great mass of the town population above their present reckless state
of poverty, would prove a salutary check upon early marriages, by giving a

taste for the comforts and decencies of life \.

Edinburgh ; of the Hon. Archibald Alison, Sheriff of Lanarkshire ; and of the Rev. Dr. Chal-
mers, Professor of Divinity in Edinburgh, on the poor. The publications of C. R. Baird,
Esq., Captain Miller and the late Dr. Cowan of Glasgow, Mr. Wilson of Aberdeen, Sheriff
Barclay of Perth, the Rev. Mr. Lewis of Dundee, Mr. Simons, Dr. Taylor, and many others.

   t It may be noticed in proof of the effect of habitual destitution on marriage and population,
that the handloom weavers, the poorest inhabitants of Glasgow, are known to marry earlier
than any other class. This fact is stated by Mr. C. R. Baird, in his ' Report on the General
and Sanatory Condition of the Working Classes and the Poor in Glasgow.' And 455
weavers outof work, whose cases were examined and reported to the Association for Inquiring
into the Pauperism of Scotland, in Edinburgh, by Captain Miller of Glasgow, had among them
1851 children. Many other striking examples to the same effect are stated by Dr. Alison in
his work on the Poor-Law of Scotland*

                       BIRTHS AND BAPTISMS.

    The inattention which prevails among parents in Scotland in regard to the
recording of the births of their children in the public registers, even though
the parties themselves continue to experience great inconvenience on many

occasions on account of the omission, is so very great, as to render the ab-
stracts of births of no avail to the statist, in so far at least as regards the

statistics of human life. If we compare the proportion of births recorded for
England and Wales, as exhibited in the Registrar General's Report for
1839-40, the year for which the number of births for England have been
most fully ascertained, we may form a pretty correct judgement of the defi-
ciency of the registers of births in Scotland. The proportion of births re-
corded for England and Wales for 1839-40 to the population of 1841 is
3*153 per cent., while the number of births or baptisms recorded for Edin-
burgh and Leith for the years exhibited in the preceding abstracts, to the
mean population of these years, is0*992 per cent.; for Aberdeen 1 "311 per cent.;
for Glasgow 1*160 per cent.; for Dundee 1*497 per cent.; and for Perth 1*704

per cent. It will thus be perceived that the smallest proportion of births or
baptisms are recorded for Edinburgh and Leith, and the greatest for Perth
and that the whole of these records are so incomplete, as to give no indica-
tion of the true number of births for these towns.

   The preceding abstracts of births or baptisms are useless to the statist,
and the only advantage to be derived from their publication is the proof they
afford of the utter inefficiency of the present mode of registering births in
Scotland, and to show the necessity there is for some legislative measure
being obtained to remedy this great national defect. Among the public as
well as private advantages which would arise from the improvement of Scotch
registers of births, it may be mentioned, that, in the event of an alteration
taking place in the Poor Laws of the country, complete registers of this na-
ture would be the most legitimate and least inconvenient means of proving
the birth-place of parties requiring aid from the public funds.

   More than one attempt has been made in Glasgow to obtain complete re-
turns of the amount of children baptised, from the clergymen of all denomi-

nations, within the limits of the bills of mortality, without leading to a
satisfactory result. It is therefore to be feared, that this very important
branch of the vital statistics of Scotland must remain incomplete till Govern-
ment be induced to apply a remedy.

        Glasgow.

   By referring to Table LI., it will be seen that the total amount of male
deaths in Glasgow and suburban districts, during the years 1837, 1838, 1839,

1840, and 1841, is 21,795, and the female deaths 20,639; being in the pro-
portion of 94*696 females to every 100 males.

   The average annual amount of male deaths during these five years ending
with 1841, is 4359, and of female deaths 4127f; while the males living
within the range of the Glasgow Mortality Bill, in 1841, is 134,087, and the
females 148,047; being in the proportion of 110*41 to every 100 males.

The average annual number of male deaths,     1 to 30*760, or 3*250 per cent.
   compared to the males living, in 1841, is  1 to 35*865, or 2*788 per cent.

    therefore as

And the average annual number of female

   deaths to the females living in the same

    years, as

        Difference                            0*462 per cent.

   The female life in Glasgow and suburbs is therefore better than the male
life by 0*462 per cent. ; while the number of male deaths during these five
years is 5*303 per cent, greater than the number of female deaths.

    The female life in Aberdeen and suburban district is therefore better than
the male life by 0*483 per cent. The number of male deaths during these
five years is 0*819 per cent, greater than the number of female deaths.

                                   Perth.

   By referring to Table LIIL, it will be seen that the total number of male

deaths in Perth, exclusive of the suburban dictrict of Kinnoul, during the
years 1837, 1838, 1839, 1840, and 1841, is 1245, and the female deaths 1321

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

being in the proportion of 106*104 females to every 100 males.
   The average annual amount of male deaths during these five years, ending

with 1841, is 249, and the female deaths 264^-; while the males living in
1841 is 8988, and the females 10,305; being in the proportion of 115*55
females to every 100 males.

The average annual number of male deaths,

compared to the number of males living in

1841, is therefore as                       1 to 36*096, or 2*770 per cent.

And the average annual number of female

deaths, to the females living in the same

year, as                                    1 to 39*004, or 2*563 per cent.

                       Difference           ,  0*207 per cent.

   The female life in the city of Perth is therefore better than the male life
by 0*207 per cent. The number of female deaths is, however, greater than
the number of male deaths by 6*104 per cent.

   The principal object of the preceding tables being, as far as possible, to                       I
supply that defect in the knowledge of the vital statistics of large towns
in Scotland which has so long existed, care has been taken to exhibit, on an
uniform plan, as extensive a collection of facts relative to disease and death
as the defective state of the registers in these towns will afford ; from which
deductions may be drawn as to how far the amount of deaths is influenced
by the local circumstances of the various towns, or to the moral and physical

--condition of their inhabitants differing, as they do, in the occupations in

which the people are engaged, and the comparative numbers of those in ex-
treme poverty, and of those in comfortable or wealthy circumstances.

   The mortality of the towns reported on being so various, and all of the
towns showing a greater proportion of deaths than is observable in country
districts, it becomes a matter of high importance to trace these differences to
their true causes, by which means the philanthropist and the legislator might
be guided in adopting such measures as might tend to remove these causes,
and ultimately lead to an effectual amelioration of the condition of the people.

    But to trace the causes of the numerous results exhibited iu the preceding
tables to the local peculiarities of these towns or to the condition of the
people, would require a very minute knowledge of the circumstances of the
inhabitants, and would inconveniently extend the limits of this Report. All
that can be here attempted, therefore, is to point out some of the most remark-
able of the results, and to offer a few observations as to how far these results
may have been occasioned by local circumstances, and to endeavour to dis-

--cover limited as our present knowledge is with regard to the vital statistics
--of the country if there be not general laws governing the distribution of

disease, and the amount of deaths from each disease, at the different ages of
the town population.

   Before proceeding to a summary of the leading facts elicited in these
tables, a few observations may be necessary in explanation of the tables
themselves, and of the manner in which they have been constructed.

    The want of a proper system for the registration of deaths as well as of
births and marriages, has long been much felt in Scotland, and repeated at-
tempts have been made to introduce a legislative measure for its improve-
ment, but without success. In the absence of a proper system for the
registration of deaths, considerable attention has been paid by the magi-

strates, kirk sessions, and other parties of some of the large towns, in whom

   ON THE VITAL. STATISTICS OP LARGE TOWNS IN SCOTLAND. 189

is vested the management of burial-grounds, to procure registers of burials.

No uniform or systematic method of recording the causes oi" death has been

adopted ; but in some of the towns the names of the fatal diseases, as stated
by the friends of the deceased, together with the ages at which death took
place, have been carefully noted ; and the data from which the preceding
tables have been constructed have been obtained from these records. In
Aberdeen the causes of death have been but partially recorded, which ren-
ders the tables for that city less satisfactory than we could have desired.
In all cases, however, the ages at which death took place appear to have
been carefully attended to, which is an important feature in the tables.

   The only portion of these towns where a proper system of recording the
diseases which cause death is to be found, is in the parish of South Leith,
where Mr. Lyon has introduced the system recommended by the Committee
of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, appointed to consider the
best mode of framing public registers of deaths. This system is admirably
adapted for the purpose, and it would be most advantageous to the advance-
ment of our knowledge of the vital statistics of the country were it uniformly
adopted for all burying-ground registers. It is to be feared, however, that
there is no hope of this being done till government be prevailed upon to in-
troduce a legislative measure. There is proof of this, in no register whatever
being kept for the burial-ground of Newhaven, situated in North Leith,
which prevents us from completing the mortality tables of that town on the
same principles as the others, though for one of the burying-grounds (South
Leith) there is at present one of the besE registers in the country.

   The classification of diseases used in the foregoing tables is far from being so
perfect as would be attainable were the system of registration recommended
by the Edinburgh Royal College of Physicians adopted. The arrangement
followed in these tables was first drawn up, with the assistance of medical gen-
tlemen, in 1835, for the construction of the tables given in the Glasgow Mor-
tality Bills. This arrangement, which will be found in the Appendix, though
by no means so complete as could be wished, is probably as much so as it
can be made in the present state of the registers of deaths in Scotland.

   Whatever defects, however, may be observable in the arrangement of dis-

eases in these tables, as the registers from which our information is obtained
are kept in a manner similar to each other, and as the results are brought
out in the tables on an uniform plan, a comparison of the amount of mortality
exhibited under the heads of the different diseases and at various ages in the

different towns, will necessarily afford useful information.
    It will be observed, that one of the distinguishing features of these disease

tables is, that the number of deaths at the different ages is made to appear
under the head of the diseases which caused death at these ages ; and for
those whose local and general information on these matters may enable them
to assist in advancing our knowledge of the physical and moral condition of
the people, the proportions which the deaths at the different ages, and the
proportions which the amount of fatal diseases bear to the whole deaths, and

also to the population of the different towns, are carefully exhibited in sepa-
rate columns.

   In those tables in which the amount of deaths by the several diseases at
different ages is specified, in some cases for five and in others for three years,
not only the number as compared with the population is given, but the pro-
portion per cent, of the deaths at the different ages, and of the causes of
death, are added ; these proportions being well suited to a comparison of
the mortality which takes place in the several towns.

    Comparing the mortality of the different towns each year with their popu-
lation as ascertained by the census of 184<1, it is obvious that the proportion
                    ;

--190 REPORT 1842.

of deaths, in all the years antecedent to 1841, would appear under the truth.

As we may assume that the increase of population from 1831 to 184-1 has been
progressively uniform during the intervening years, the amount of population

for the several towns of Scotland, as exhibited in the tables, has been calcu-
lated accordingly ; and on the amount of population thus obtained, the pro-
portions of the relative mortality of the different towns have been calculated.

    As it is an object of great interest and importance to observe the effect of
the seasons on the amount of mortality in different localities, tables are
added, showing the amount of deaths monthly for these towns, and also ex-
hibiting the proportions which the average of deaths in each month bear to

the annual average of deaths.
   Tables are also added, showing the amount of burials in each burying

place within the boundaries of the different towns ; but, as it does not always
follow that the inhabitants of the different localities make use of the burying-
ground in their immediate neighbourhood, no great reliance can be placed on
any information of this nature. These tables, however, assist to test the

accuracy of the other tables.
    Tables are also given, showing the amount of deaths by fever and eruptive

diseases under five, under twenty, and above twenty years of age, and the
proportion the deaths by these diseases bear to the whole deaths. The
results exhibited in these tables are well worthy of consideration. In the
present limited state of our knowledge of the vital statistics of the country,
it is obviously desirable that a minute analysis should be made of the fatal

effects produced by the various diseases on the population at different ages,
and under every variety of circumstances. By such analysis we may be en-
abled to trace those general laws by which nature appears to govern the di-
stribution of disease and mortality. Should this object be attained, a most
important step would be gained in the progress of our knowledge of vital
statistics, and the science itself be enhanced in utility.

   For several years past much labour has been bestowed on the Mortality
Bills of Glasgow, in order to exhibit the amount of mortality arising from the

various diseases at different ages ; considerable uniformity was noted in the
results of the fever and eruptive fever tables of Glasgow and other towns
and the confirmation this uniformity has received from the more extended
results now before us, leads to the belief that it cannot be looked upon as a
matter of chance, but that it indicates the possibility of our arriving, by a
still more extended sphere of observation, and by a more correct system in
the registration of the fatal diseases, at a knowledge of precise laws which
seem to regulate the amount of deaths at different ages by fever and eruptive

diseases. It may be too much to speak confidently of arriving at this very

desirable result, yet the evidence is sufficiently strong to justify the bringing
these circumstances under particular notice, which will be done in the re-

marks we have to make on the leading results brought out in these tables.
    With regard to the hospitals and dispensaries for the poor inhabitants of

these townsj they are placed on a very equal footing. To visit the Royal
Infirmary or the Dispensary of any one of these towns will lead to a correct
judgment of all the others. Differences may be observed as to the newness
of the building, or in some of the minor arrangements, but superintended as
they all are by suitable officers, the same high character of efficiency is com-
mon to all of them, and renders the benefit they confer on the poor and

destitute in time of sickness and bodily distress one of the greatest blessings
they enjoy. The differences, therefore, that are to be observed in the
amount of mortality in the towns, are not traceable to differences in the
means of affording medical relief!

    The first difference to be observed in the amount of the annual mortality
   ON THE VITAL STATISTICS OP LARGE TOWNS IN SCOTLAND. 191

in the towns reported on, is that which appears to arise from atmospheric in-
fluence or some other unknown cause, which seems to have a greater or less
effect on the human frame in different years. The influence of extreme
cold on the amount of mortality has been frequently noticed by writers on
this subject ; and though others have attributed the excess of mortality
which is sometimes observable more to sudden changes of temperature than
to extreme cold, it is very evident that excessive cold, though it is not the
only atmospheric influence to be guarded against, has a powerful influence
in producing a great mortality, and the effect of that influence is inversely

as the abundance of nutritive food, clothing and fuel at the command of the
people to guard against i£\ Table LXVI. testifies in the strongest manner to
the effects of temperature and the changes of the seasons upon vitality.

   The most fatal month in the year to human life is January, the per-centage
deaths of the total number of deaths ranging from 10 to 14^- per cent. The
next most fatal month is February ; and a singular uniformity prevails in the
per-centage deaths to the whole deaths in all the towns ; then follow Decem-

--ber and March, and the mortality diminishes until July August, gradually

increasing again with the fall of the year until it is at its maximum in Janu-

ary ; in short, having a close correspondence with the progress of the sun in

the ecliptic, the maximum intensity being when the sun is furthest removed
from our latitudes, and its minimum effects occurring when the sun is in the

neighbourhood of the northern tropic. It might probably be more correct
to say that the mean mortality accords with the monthly mean temperature.
The tables exhibit a somewhat singular feature in the proportional excess of
deaths in Edinburgh in the summer months over the other towns, combined
with a somewhat smaller proportion in the month of January, but an excess
in the month of December. These anomalies may possibly originate in the
topography of the town, or in the averages being for three years only for

Edinburgh and for five years for the other towns. Th& influence of high

winds in removing infection and disease has also been noticed by writers,
and is a subject of great interest in cdnnexion with the sanitary condition of
great towns, where the inhabitants are often crowded together in closely
pent-up houses, where a free circulation of air is not to be expected.

    Sir Gilbert Blane, in describing the effects of a hurricane which took place
in the West Indies, in October 1780, after some observations on its beneficial
effects on the prevailing diseases of the country, except where the old and
delicate suffered from mechanical violence, says, " This is a fact so paradoxi-

cal, that if I had not a concurrence of testimony, and in some degree my

own observation, I could neither credit nor would venture to relate it. It
had a visibly good effect on the diseases of the country ; fevers, fluxes, and
chronic diarrhoeas, the consequence of dysenteries, were also cured by it.
But the diseases upon which it operated most visibly and sensibly were pul-
monic complaints. Some cases, supposed to be beginning consumption, and
even the acute state of pleurisy, were cured by it*."

    In connexion with any inquiry into the sanitary condition of large towns,
it is therefore of importance to ascertain what state of the atmosphere is most
prejudicial or most favourable to health, operating as its changes do to a

greater or less extent, according to the local circumstances of these towns, in
regard to the free circulation of air, proper drainage, cleanliness, and the com-
forts of the people in lodging, food and clothingf . It is to be feared, however,

    f The propriety of publishing meteorological tables for these towns in connexion with this
subject is sufficiently obvious, and would have been attended to, had not the construction of
the preceding tables necessarily occupied much more time than was anticipated.
 192 REPORT-- 1842.

 that our meteorological observations are not yet sufficiently extensive to en-
 able us to form, a correct judgment of the specific effects of atmospheric
 phsenomena, when combined with the local circumstances of large towns,

 nor to point out how these effects are to be most effectually obviated. " It
 is not only necessary to know the temperature and weight of the air at par-
 ticular times but also the direction and force of the ivind, with the quantity

 of moisture it contains ; also its electrical state, together with the quantity of
 rain that falls."

    From the imperfect system folloAved in recording the deaths in many of the
 registers, we are obliged to assume that those deaths which occur beyond the

limits of any of these towns, and in which burial takes place within their
limits, are balanced by those cases in which death takes place in the towns
 and the burials elsewhere. In Perth, where there is a steady and somewhat
decreasing population, there may perhaps be rather an excess of those who
die at a distance buried within the limits of the city. With regard to Aber-

deen, Bailie Forbes and others, whom we have consulted on the subject, in-
form us that a considerable number of iniiabitants who die in that city are
buried at a distance, often where the family of the party may have origi-

nally been seated ; and although the ages at which death takes place in
that town, and other circumstances, clearly prove that Aberdeen is favour-
ably situated as to its sanitary condition, we are inclined to believe that the
average annual mortality of that town is very considerably understated at
1 in 49'737, as in the preceding tables. With regard to the other towns, it
would be difficult to form an estimate as to whether the amount of those who
die beyond and are buried within their limits, or those who die within and
are buried beyond the limits, is the greatest. As the proportion of such

burials, however, may be considered uniform throughout the year, a fair
judgment may be formed as to the relative effect of the seasons in connexion

with other causes on the mortality of the different towns.

    In Aberdeen, it will be observed, there is an excess in the proportion of
deaths over those of Edinburgh during the months of January, February,
March, April and May. It will be perceived that in February the excess is
the greatest, and amounts to 1*90 per cent, of the average annual deaths.
During the seven last months of the year the proportion of deaths is greater
in Edinburgh than in Aberdeen ; the greatest difference being in September,
in which month the excess in Edinburgh amounts to I'll per cent, of the
average annual deaths. For the relative mortality in these towns for the
different months, see Table LXIII.

   From Table LXIV. it will be found that there is an excess of deaths in
Perth over those in Edinburgh during the months of January, February,
March, April, May and August; the greatest excess is in January, amounting

to 3"36 per cent, of the whole deaths* ; and in June, July, September, October,
November and December, there is an excess of deaths in Edinburgh as com-
pared with Perth ; the greatest excess is in June, amounting to P98 per
cent, of the annual average of deaths..

   In Dundee there is an excess of deaths in the months of January, February,
March, and May as compared with Edinburgh ; the greatest excess is in
January, and amounts to 4'31 per cent, of the annual average of deaths.
During all the other months the excess of deaths is in Edinburgh, amounting
in September to 1*63, and in November to 1*69 per cent. See Table LXV.

   It is much to be regretted that circumstances have prevented the construc-

tion of monthly tables of mortality for five years instead of three for Edin-

burgh. Had this been the case, the proportionate mortality would not have

   * The great mortality which was caused by fever and influenza in January 1837, is the
reason of this proportion being so liigh.
ON THE VITAL STATISTICS OF LARGE TOWNS IN SCOTLAND. 193

been quite so favourable for that city during the winter months as is made to

appear by these tables. The amount of deaths from fever and influenza,

which was excessive in the beginning of 1837, is included in the results

brought forward for the other towns, but it has not been obtained for Edin-

burgh. The relative proportions of the deaths during the different months,

as exhibited in these tables, are therefore more correct for the other towns

than they are for that city.

Whatever influence the vicissitudes of the atmosphere may have, there are

obviously other causes greatly affecting mortality, such as a free circulation

of air, drainage, cleanliness, temperance, the abundance of wholesome food,

clothing, fuel, and the occupations of the people.

One of the objects of research in vital statistics is to make comparisons of

the effects produced on different communities similarly situated with regard

to these various circumstances, and to observe how far the same causes pro-
duce the same results on the human frame.

But it must be of rare occurrence to find two towns similarly situated

in all these respects. In the towns for which these tables are constructed, it

will be observed, that while some approach near to each other in some

points, both in regard to their sanitary condition and the circumstances of

the people, yet they differ in others, and the difference is accompanied with

a greater or less amount of mortality.

   From the tables in which the deaths are brought forward for a series of years,
it will be seen (Tables XXXII. to XLIX.) that the greatest number of deaths

at the very early ages takes place in Glasgow and Dundee, towns possessing
many features common to both ; their manufactures, commerce and public

works resemble each other, the wages of the working classes, the appearance

of their houses, and the rents paid for them, are much the same, and the price

of food is nearly equal in both places. The deficiency of proper drainage, the

accumulation of impurities, and the want of a free circulation of air, are very

observable in both cases. In both towns there is a large proportion of the

wretchedly poor, though the largest proportion is decidedly in Glasgow.

It appears (Tables LI. and LIV.) that the average annual amount of mor-

tality in Glasgow for the last five years is as 1 to 31*10, or 3*21 per cent.;

Weand in Dundee, for the same years, as 1 to 38*37, or 2*60 per cent.    have

already stated that the accuracy of these results depends on whether or not

the number of deaths which take place in these towns, with burial in the

country, or the deaths that take place in the country, with burial in the

Atowns, balance each other.   more -correct judgment may therefore be

formed of the relative mortality of these towns by a comparison of the ages

at which death takes place than by these general results.
   By referring to Tables LI. and LIV., it will be found that the proportion of

deaths at Glasgow under one year of age, to the population on an average

of years, exceeds that of Edinburgh by 0*178 per cent. In Dundee the pro-

portion is greater than in Edinburgh by 0*086 per cent. The excess of deaths

at one and under two years of age in Glasgow over those in Edinburgh, is

0*21 per cent.; in Dundee, 0*07 per cent. At two and under five years of

age the excess of deaths in Glasgow is greater than in Edinburgh by 0*18

per cent. ; and in Dundee by 0*11 per cent. Again (Table LXXIV.), it ap-

pears that in Glasgow the average annual proportion of deaths under five

years of age, to the mean population, is 1*43 per cent., and to the whole

average annual deaths is 44*58 per cent.; while in Dundee the proportion of

deaths under these years, to the population, is 1*13 per cent., and to the

whole average deaths is 46*82 per cent. Table LXXVI. shows that in Glas-
gow 1*79 per cent, per annum of the population die under twenty years of

age, and in Dundee 1*38 per cent. It will be observed, however, that the pro-

1842.                                   o
--194 report 1842.

 portion of deaths under twenty years of age in Glasgow, to the total deaths,
 is 55-95 per cent., whereas in Dundee it amounts to 57'52 per cent.

      It will also be observed that at the higher ages there is an excess of deaths in
 Edinburgh over either Glasgow or Dundee, with the exception of those above
 ninety-five years of age, at which ages the excess of deaths takes place in Glas-

 gow and Dundee. Table LXXVIII. shows that 1 -4d per cent, per annum of the
 population of Glasgow die above twenty years of age, and that 1*02 per cent,
 of the population of Dundee die above that age ; 44-04 per cent, of the whole
 deaths taking place in Glasgow above that age, and 42*4-7 per cent, in Dundee.

      It is plain, therefore, that as the proportion of deaths at the different ages
 under five years, under twenty, and above twenty years of age, to the whole

 deaths, leads to the belief that Dundee is a less healthy town than Glasgow,
 and that the deaths at the two former age3, to the population, show that
 Glasgow is the least healthy of the two towns, the inference to be drawn is

 either that those deaths which take place beyond the limits of Glasgow, and
 in which burial takes place within the limits, exceed the number of those
 cases in which death takes place in the town, and the burials elsewhere, or
 that the opposite of this is the case in Dundee.

    It is to be regretted that we are unable to give tables of mortality and of
 marriages for the town of Ayr. As that town is so similarly situated in many

 respects to Perth, a very interesting and useful comparison might have been
 made of the relative amount of the marriages and deaths in these towns.

     There is a very considerable difference between the local circumstances of
 Perth and those of Glasgow or Dundee. This town is chiefly dependent on its
 connexion with the rich agricultural districts that surround it ; it has some

 factories of flax, woollen and cotton, but these are of inconsiderable extent*.

Of the towns for which we have constructed tables, Edinburgh approaches

    * Of the population of Perth there are ahout 900 adults employed as hand-loom weavers,
and a considerable portion of them produce a fabric somewhat peculiar to themselves ; and
as the manufacture of this species of goods has not fallen off so much as the goods manu-
factured in Paisley, the weavers have been comparatively well off in this district lately, many
of them making from 10*. to 12». per week; some of them, however, do not make half so
much. The wages of the ordinary labourer are rather lower than in some other towns ; the
price of food, however, is considerably lower. The 41b. loaf retails at Id., whereas at Glas-
gow it is 'id., and till very lately 10(7. ; and all other kinds of food seem to be cheaper than
at Glasgow. On inspection, it does not appear that there is so much of that extreme desti-
tution and utter wretchedness which is to be met with in some other towns. The houses of the
poorer classes are better, and the rents more moderate than elsewhere. Some of the lodging-
houses for the poor, though better than in some other towns, are certainly capable of im-
provement; but, generally speaking, good beds, blankets and sheets are provided, and con-
siderable attention seems to be paid to their cleanliness. It does not appear that there are
so many lodgers crowded into one room as at Aberdeen, Dundee, or Glasgow.

    Perth is a fine, open, well-aired town. With regard to drainage, it possesses great advan-
tages in the command of a fine stream of water, which enters at the north-west part of the
town, and is there divided into three branches, passing through different portions of the
city, carrying off the impurities which are thrown into it from various parts of the town by
surface drains. The improvement of covered drains, as contemplated by the Lord Provost,
must still further add to the comfort and health of the inhabitants. The greatest attention
is paid to the scavenger department of the police, and the manure is carefully removed to the
outskirts of the town. Accumulations of this kind are unknown in any part of Perth.

   As the county of Perth is well known to be a wool-growing country, it may be mentioned
that great encouragement has been extended by the Lord Provost and magistrates to the
woollen manufactures, and various premiums have been offered to those who may introduce
or increase these manufactures ; and as the county town should form a very suitable mart for
these manufactures, a wool fair has lately been established under the same auspices, and it has
been very successful.

   "Without entering into further detail, it may be stated that Perth, without being subject to
a high state of prosperity or of adversity, possesses many advantages which tend to promote
the comfort and well-being of the inhabitants.
                                                                                     ;

the nearest to it, though there are some important particulars in which they

differ considerably.

   It will be seen (Table LXVII.) that the average annual mortality in Edin-
burgh for the last five years, to the mean population of these years, is as 1 to

34-90, or 2-86 per cent., and in Perth it is as 1 to 37*87, or 2-64 per cent. It

will also be observed (Table LIIL), that there is an excess in the proportion of

deaths in Edinburgh at nearly all the ages up to fifty years, over those which

took place at Perth, with the exception of those at two and under five, and

those at fifteen and under twenty years ; and that the greatest proportion of

deaths at all the ages above fifty years in these towns is in Perth. It will be
observed, that the difference in the proportion of these deaths, at any of the
ages stated in the table, does not extend to high numbers ; the greatest excess
in Edinburgh being of the deaths under one year, which amounts to 0'07 per

cent, of the whole population ; and the greatest proportion of deaths in
Perth over those of Edinburgh is at the age of seventy and under seventy-

five years, which amounts to 0*09 per cent.

   It may further be observed (Table LXXVI.), that in Edinburgh the deaths
under twenty years of age amount annually to 1*1 1 per cent, of the population,

and to 43*88 per cent, of the whole deaths ; while in Perth the deaths under
the same age amount to 1*01 per cent, of the population, and to 38*26 per
cent, of the whole deaths. Again (Table LXXVIIL), the deaths in Edinburgh
above twenty years of age amount to 1*43 per cent, of the population, and to

56*11 per cent, of the whole deaths ; while in Perth the deaths above the same
age amount to 1*63 per cent, of the population, and to 61*73 per cent, of

the whole deaths.

The differences in the mortality of these two cities might be traced to

the local circumstances of the inhabitants, but to pursue this subject further

would lead us beyond the limits of this Report.
   With regard to Aberdeen, partaking as it does partly of the character of

Perth as a county town, and of the character of Glasgow and Dundee in the

extent of its factories for the manufacture of flax, cotton and woollen goods,

the defective state of the registers prevents us from making the tables show-
ing the causes of death so complete as for the other towns*. By a careful

examination of the mortality tables for this town, it will be found that they
afford good reason to believe that Aberdeen is very healthy f; although, as

We* have been very obligingly favoured with extracts of Registers and Reports from the

Hospitals and Royal Infirmary, by several of the medical gentlemen of that city, for the pur-

pose of supplying this deficiency to a certain extent.

f Much has been done of late years to improve the city of Aberdeen, by removing old,

closely-built and ill-aired houses, and by building wider streets, more healthy houses, and

Aelegant public buildings in their stead.  considerable number of lanes and closes, sur-

rounded by the worst description of houses, have been in this manner removed. And in visiting

any of those closes where this class of houses is still to be found, it is gratifying to observe

that great attention is paid to the scavenger department of the police. None of those offen-

sive accumulations of animal and vegetable matter, which are so conspicuous in some parts

of Glasgow, Leith and Dundee, are allowed to remain to destroy the comfort and the health

of the inhabitants. Through the kind attention of Captain Barclay, superintendent of

police, we have been able to compare the condition of the poorest class of the inhabitants

with the condition of those in other towns. There is perhaps no town in which there are

worse cases of miserable destitution than are to be met with in Aberdeen, but, fortunately

for that city, these cases bear a much smaller proportion to the population than is to be met

with in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee, or perhaps in Liverpool. The lodging-houses for

the poor in Aberdeen are often densely crowded. In Peacock's Close, for example, above
twenty people are frequently to be found sleeping in a room from ten to twelve feet square,

with a small closet adjoining. In the majority of these lodging-houses, however, the white-

ness of the sheets and blankets indicates a much higher degree of comfort than is to be ob-
served among the same class of people in the towns above alluded to.

The trade and commerce of Aberdeen have long been of a steady and prosperous nature

bankruptcies are of very rare occurrence in that city. The price of animal food is con-

has been already stated, from some of the inhabitants being buried beyond
the limits of the town, the probability is that the deaths which are recorded
are not the whole deaths, and therefore the returns from the burying-grounds
may be considered incomplete, and make the proportionate mortality of this
town appear somewhat less than it really is.

   The average annual mortality in Aberdeen appears (Table LXXI.) to be as
1 to 4-9'72, or 2*01 per cent.; and it will be observed (Table LII.), that with
the exception of the ages at fifteen and under twenty years, there is an excess
of mortality at all the ages specified in the tables up to eighty years in Edin-
burgh over the proportion which takes place at these ages in this town. At
all the ages above eighty years, consequently, the greatest proportion of deaths
which take place in these towns is in Aberdeen. It is further shown (Table
LXXVI.), that in Aberdeen the deaths under twenty years of age amount to
0"8G per cent, of the population, and to 43*14 per cent, of the whole deaths;
and that (Table LXXVIII.) the deaths above twenty years of age amount to
1*14 per cent, of the population, and to 56"85 per cent, of the whole deaths.

                 DISEASES.

The tables commencing with No. XXXII. and ending with No. XLIX., ex-

hibit the number of fatal cases of disease that occurred in the different towns

during successive years, classified according to eighteen periods of life at which

they took place ; and show also the total number of deaths at each period,
and the proportions which these and the number of deaths, from the several

diseases, bear to the total number of deaths, and also to the population. It

will be observed, that our information on these heads extends only to three

years for Edinburgh and for Dundee*. Circumstances have prevented tables

of this description from being made for these towns for the years 1837 and

1838, as was intended. For the other towns, with the exception of Leith,

these tables extend to five years. It is to be regretted that the state of the

registers of Leith prevents tables of this kind from being made out for more

than two years ; and even these are not so complete as the others, owing to

no registers being kept for the burying-ground of Newhaven. The amount

of mortality in these towns, caused by the various diseases at different ages

Weduring successive years, may be seen by referring to the tables.      may

here, however, notice some of the more marked results brought out in the

five following tables, No. L. to LIV., in which the results are brought for-

ward and comparisons are made for the several towns, on an average of

the different years for which these tables have been constructed.

It will be observed (Table L.), that there is a proportionate excess of deaths

in Edinburgh over those in Glasgow, by the causes classed under the heads

"aged," "diseases of the head," " of the heart," " inflammation," and by those

diseases which are not distinctly brought out, as stated in the Appendix, but

which are classed under the head of miscellaneous diseases. The greatest

proportion of deaths by all the other diseases takes place in Glasgow. The

greatest excess of deaths in Edinburgh over those of Glasgow, appears to be

siderably lower than in Glasgow. Fish is about one-third cheaper than in that town. The

wages of the working classes appear to he much the same as in other towns. There does

Wenot appear to be too great a supply of labour for the demand for it.  have the authority

of Lord Provost Blackie for stating that, till the late severe depression of trade, no man who

was willing to work could be at a loss to procure employment.

* These tables for Dundee have been constructed from extracts from the registers

of that town for the purpose. The data which have enabled us to extend the other

mortality tables for that town to five years, have been obtained from the Dundee Mortality
Bills, which have been very ably drawn up by W. B. Baxter, Esq. And the data from which

the other tables for Edinburgh have been constructed were obtained from the paper on Vital

Statistics, read to the Statistical Section of the British Association at Glasgow, by Mr.

Alexander Watt.
   ON THE VITAL STATISTICS OF LARGE TOWNS IN SCOTLAND. 197

caused by diseases of the head, amounting to 0*047 per cent. The greatest
excess in Glasgow is by fever, amounting to 0*21 per cent. It is here to be
observed, however, that the great excess of deaths by fever during 1837, in
these towns, is included for Glasgow, though the amount has not been ob-
tained, and is not included in this table for Edinburgh : so that the excess of
deaths by fever in Glasgow over those in Edinburgh appears greater than it
really is. The excess of deaths by bowel complaint in Glasgow, over those
in Edinburgh, amounts to 0*20 per cent. For the per-centage of other diseases

see the Table.

   As Table LIV. gives the amount of deaths in Dundee by the different
diseases for the same years as those in which it has been obtained for Edin-
burgh, the comparison is still more satisfactory than for the other towns. It
will be observed, that the greatest excess of deaths in Dundee over those in
Edinburgh is caused by asthma, bowel complaint, catarrh, croup, dropsy,
hooping-cough, measles, nervous diseases, scarlet fever, and small-pox ; the
highest excess being by measles, amounting to 0*102 per cent. The greatest
proportion of deaths by all the other diseases is in Edinburgh. The highest
proportion of deaths in that town over those of Dundee is by decline, and
amounts to 0*137 per cent. For the other proportions see the Table.

   The names of only 33*8 per cent, of the fatal cases of disease have been
ascertained for Aberdeen, and exhibited in the tables for that town ; and as
these bear but a small proportion to the total amount of deaths, the propor-
tions to the population have been omitted in the tables, as they could form
no data for comparison with the amount of fatal cases of disease ascer-
tained for the other towns. The proportion of deaths by the several diseases
ascertained, to the whole of the fatal cases of ascertained disease, is, how-

ever, given in Table LII.

    It should be noticed, that for the different towns, with the exception of
Aberdeen, the diseases stated under the head " not ascertained," consist
chiefly of such diseases as the relatives of the deceased could not exactly
describe ; several of them being named in the registers " inward complaints,"
&c. It is obvious, that to whichever columns the numbers under this head
ought to be transferred, very few of them belong to the columns of fever,
or eruptive fevers, the characteristics of which are so strongly marked.

    There are some cases upon the recording of which clue attention has not
been bestowed; yet the proportion of deaths stated in all the tables, but
those for Aberdeen, may be considered as being tolerably accurate.

  We have already called attention to the uniformity in the proportion of

deaths at the different periods of life by fever and eruptive fevers, to the
whole deaths, by these several diseases. Although in several instances there
is a considerable difference in the proportion of these diseases to the amount
of population, yet the uniform proportion of the mortality by these diseases
which falls on the different ages is very striking, and leads to the belief, as
before stated, that by a still more extended range of observation, and by a
more correct system of registration of the fatal diseases, we might find that
fixed laws regulate the amount of deaths at different ages by the several

diseases.

   Table LV. shows, that while the proportion of deaths by fever, under five
years of age, for the last three years in Edinburgh, amounted to 0'029 per
cent, of the population, it amounted to 12*4>1 per cent, of the whole deaths
by fever. In Glasgow (Table LVI.), while the deaths by fever, at the same
age, for the last five years, amounted to 0*053 per cent, of the population,
they amounted to 12*07 per cent, of the whole deaths by fever; being very
nearly the same proportion to the whole deaths by lever as in Edinburgh.
Again (same tables), while the deaths by fever, under twenty years of age,
--198 REPORT 1842.

for the last three years in Edinburgh, amounted to 0*070 per cent, of the
population, they amounted to 29*74; per cent, of the whole deaths by fever.

    In Glasgow, while the deaths by fever, at the same age, for the last five
years, amounted to 0*129 per cent, of the population, they amounted to 29*05
per cent, of the deaths by fever, being still very nearly in the same propor-
tion to the whole deaths by fever as in Edinburgh. Again, in Edinburgh,
while the deaths by fever, above twenty years of age, during the last three
years, amount to 0*165 per cent, of the population, they amount to 70*25 per

cent, of the whole deaths by fever. And in Glasgow, while the deaths by
fever, above that age, amount to 0*316 per cent of the population, they

amount to 70*94- per cent, of the whole deaths by fever.
   By referring to the tables for the other towns, it will be perceived that the

proportions of the deaths by fever, at the different ages, to the whole deaths
by fever, are not so very close to each other as they are in Edinburgh and
Glasgow yet the difference is not great, and may be accounted for partly by

                                        ;

the defective state of the registers, as well as by some local circumstances
which cannot yet be clearly traced.

  We have had time only to construct tables similar to those immediately

referred to, for a few of the fever cases, exhibited in the Reports of the Regis-
trar-General for towns in England. As those we have constructed, however,

6how very striking results for Manchester and Liverpool, we here insert the

results corresponding with those above quoted.

  We have made out tables like the above for some of the other diseases.

The results are all similar to those in the following table for Inflammation,
in which there is a great variation in the proportions for the different towns.
It is to be doubted, however, if much reliance can be placed on the accuracy
Avith which these diseases are recorded in the registers.

   It will be found by the tables above referred to, that the proportion of the
total annual average deaths by inflammation to the mean population of Edin-
burgh amounts to 0'196 per cent. ; in Glasgow to 0*185 per cent. ; in Perth
to 0-139 per cent. ; in Dundee to 0-143 per cent.

The following is the proportion which the deaths by Inflammation, at different
   a<*es, bear to the whole deaths by inflammation, in different towns, and also

    to the population.

   ON THE VITAL STATISTICS OF LARGE TOWNS IN SCOTLAND. 201

to 56*1 1 per cent, of the whole deaths. In England these proportions were re-

spectively 1*082 and 49*17 per cent. And in London the proportion of deaths

amounted to 1*36 per cent, of the population, and to 50*77 per cent, of the
whole deaths. In Manchester only 39*01 per cent- of the whole deaths take
place above 20 years of age, and 1*296 per cent, of its population.

   It is worthy of observation, that the mortality at the different ages in Man-
chester (the greatest manufacturing town in England) bears nearly the same
proportion to that of London, as the mortality at these ages in Glasgow (the
greatest manufacturing town in Scotland) bears to that of Edinburgh.

   It will be seen (Tables LXXIV. and LXXV.) that the proportion of deaths

under 5 years in Manchester is 10*83 per cent, of the whole deaths, and 0*639
per cent, of the population greater than in London ; and in Glasgow the pro-
portion of deaths under the same age is 12*07 per cent, of the whole deaths,
and 0*67 per cent, of the population greater than in Edinburgh. Again, it

will be found (Tables LXXVIII. and LXXIX.) that the proportion of deaths

above 20 years of age in Manchester is 11*76 per cent, of the whole deaths,
and 0*040 per cent, of the population less than in London ; and in Glasgow
the proportion of deaths above that age is 12*07 per cent, of the whole deaths,
and 0*016 per cent, of the population less than in Edinburgh.

   The average annual proportions of deaths to the mean population in the

towns of England, is exhibited in Table LXXX. In London the average an-

nual proportion of deaths during the years 1837-38, 1838-39, and 1839-40, to
the mean population of these years, was as 1 to 37*34, or 2*67 per cent.; in
Manchester as 1 in 28*06, or 3*563 per cent.; in Liverpool as 1 to 28*30, or
3*537 per cent.; in Leeds as 1 to 36*76, or 2*720 per cent.; and in Birming-

ham as 1 to 36*82 or 2*716 per cent.*

  We have already had occasion to notice the tendency which reckless po-

verty and the absence of artificial comforts in the dwellings of a large pro-
portion of the town population has to increase the number of improvident
marriages, and consequently of births. The effect of extreme poverty
in extending disease and mortality among the inhabitants of these towns, is
also apparent from the results exhibited in the preceding pages. Other
causes are mentioned as having a powerful influence in producing those fatal
effects observable in the amount of mortality in large towns, such as intem-
perance and inattention to cleanliness, together with a want of proper drain-
age and a free circulation of air among the houses of the poor.

   The abuse of spirituous liquors has been well described as "at once the

* In regard to this comparison of the mortality in the English and Scotch towns, parti-

cularly iu early life, it is to be observed, that in several of the former, in the years compared,

there were unusually severe epidemics of small-pox, measles and scarlet fever, the mortality

from which falls almost entirely on the early periods of life. Thus in London, in 1838-39,

small-pox caused 3817 deaths, or 1 in 138 of the whole mortality, and in 1839-40 measles

and scarlet fever together caused 4535 deaths, or 1 in 10 of the whole mortality ; in Man-

chester  in  1839-40  measles  alone  caused 1131  deaths, or  1  in 8-1  of  the  whole mortality
                                                                                                                                              ;

in Liverpool in 1837-38 small-pox caused 634 deaths, or 1 in 7"7 of the whole mortality, and

in 1839-40 measles and scarlet fever caused 934 deaths, or 1 in 9'8 of the whole mortality

while in Glasgow, and still more in Edinburgh, there have been no such virulent epidemics of

these diseases.

   Now these are epidemics which no doubt affect the poorer classes of the population in any

town more than the richer, but which extend rapidly through all ranks, and the extension of
which must be regarded as accidental, depending apparently more on the peculiar viru-

lence of the specific poisons than on any remediable causes. In estimating the average de-

gree of unhealthiness of a town, or drawing any inference as to the social condition of the
people, the mortality from such epidemics should be omitted from the calculation, or else the
estimate should be framed on the comparison of such a number of years that unusually severe

epidemics may be included in the records of all the towns.

cause and consequence of destitution * ;" and as inattention to cleanliness
may also be considered as an universal attendant of extreme poverty, it is
not easy to see how the effects of the one can be traced without these effects
being found in some degree to be influenced by the other; nor, indeed, does
it seem possible to distinguish ,the effects of extreme poverty from those of
defective ventilation and draining, because the poorest people have no choice
of residence, and cannot avoid congregating in such numbers as to imply
very deficient ventilation.

and death is undoubted; and we too often witness the pernicious effects pro-
duced on the family of the drunkard by his expending on what is to injure
his health, degrade him in the eyes of his fellow men, and bring him to an
early grave, those funds whereby he would be enabled to procure a greater
abundance of wholesome food, clothing and fuel for his family, to protect them
against the inclemency of the seasons and the ravages of disease, and by be-
stowing upon them a better education at once to procure a more happy home
for himself and for them. It is gratifying, however, to learn from well-in-
formed parties in the towns reported on, that marked improvement has taken
place in the temperance habits of the people: and too much praise cannot
be bestowed on those philanthropic individuals whose exertions have been
the means of urging forward this salutary reformation.

  We have endeavoured, but without success, to ascertain the exact quantity

of spirituous liquors consumed by the population of Glasgow. The quantity
brought into the city may be easily ascertained ; but the quantity that is sent
out of Glasgow, in such portions as may not require a permit for its protec-
tion, or even where the requirement of a permit may not be attended to,
and which is consumed by the agriculturists, and by many inhabitants of the
towns and villages to a considerable distance, round Glasgow, cannot be as-
certained, and therefore the amount of population by which the spirits entered
in the books of the Excise is consumed cannot be stated.

   Without being in possession of sufficiently accurate information to enable
us to state whether a greater excess in the use of intoxicating liquors is more
customary in Glasgow than in the other towns for which our tables are

constructed, it will readily be admitted that this pernicious vice is too pre-
valent in all of them ; and the amount of destitution and misery arising in
consequence of it is greatly to be deplored. It has frequently been stated

as one of the principal causes of female life being better than that of the

males, that the men are more intemperate in their habits than the women.
Were this the case, the greatest abuse of spirituous liquors may be looked
for in Edinburgh, as the female life in that town is 0*50 per cent, better than
the male life. And the most moderate use of spirituous liquors may be

looked for in Perth, as the male life is only 0*20 per cent, worse than the
female life in that town. In Glasgow the female life is better than the male

life by 0*46 per cent.; in Aberdeen by 048 per cent.; and in Dundee by
0*33 per centf Were, therefore, the relative mortality of men and women
as the indulgence in intoxicating liquors, and the women alike temperate

in their habits in the different towns, then these figures would form a sort of
index of the degree of intemperance indulged in by the men. It may be
objected to this, that the number of females employed at the factories of
Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee, may have injurious effects on female life,
and make the difference in the proportion of male and female deaths in these
towns to be less than it otherwise would be. As, however, the inhabitants

of Edinburgh and Perth are more like each other as to the nature of their

employments, should intemperance on the part of the males be a principal

cause of the difference in male and female deaths, then the proportion of in-

temperance should be as five in Edinburgh to two in Perth.

   Whatever may be the influence of intemperance in producing a high
rate of mortality, both by the direct effects it produces on the human frame
and by the destitution and misery which result from it, there are too many

cases of extreme destitution in the towns of Scotland, arising from causes

beyond the control of the sufferers, and for which there is no adequate re-

lief provided by law. The effect of destitution in producing disease and
death, seems to be admitted by all writers on the subject. Differences may

arise as to the particular disease or diseases most affected by it ; but all

agree, that where a great degree of destitution exists, there is to be found

a high amount of mortality.

It is especially to be observed with regard to the years of severe depression

of trade, that the case of the really destitute poor in the manufacturing towns

of Scotland is not then so bad as during the years of ordinary prosperity. Many
of the better class of operatives require to submit to a much greater degree of

suffering and privation than they are accustomed to, and the effects of these

privations are much to be dreaded in the event of an unhealthy season set-
ting in upon them. But the extraordinary exertions made by subscriptions

from the more wealthy inhabitants, and from public funds, to supply food

--and clothing to the poor by means of soup-kitchens, distribution of old
--clothes and otherwise, over and above the ordinary parochial relief, often

renders the condition of the really destitute much better at these times than

Weit is under ordinary circumstances.  cannot, therefore, form such a cor-

rect judgment of the effects of destitution during these years on the mortality

of large towns in Scotland as is generally imagined.

Were the local distribution of the population in towns the same as in

Edinburgh and Glasgow, where the rich and the poor are found to occupy

distinct districts, a more correct knowledge of the mortality among the dif-

ferent classes of the people would be come to than has yet. been obtained.

In the report of Monsieur Villerme, in vol. x. of Archives Generates, it is

shown, that in the three districts of Paris in which the mortality is least the

inhabitants are the wealthiest, and in the three districts in which the inhabit-

ants are the poorest the mortality is the greatest.

In a valuable paper *, " On the best means of supplying the poor with

-- Wecheap and nutritious food," read to the Philosophical Society of Glasgow by
Dr. R. D. Thomson, he says, "  trust the day is fast approaching when

the light of science will enable the guardians of the poor to manage our po-

verty-stricken fellow-men by precise and definite rules, and will teach all
classes of the community that the quantity of vital air supplied by the

Creator to man is based on fixed laws which require the imbibition of a cer-
tain amount of food. An adult consumes every day 30^ ounces of oxygen

or vital air from the atmosphere. To consume this, and to convert it into

carbonic acid, he requires, according to Liebig, about 13 ounces of carbon,

in the form of food. If the food is withheld, the carbon must be supplied

from the muscles and substance of the body ; the latter becomes thinner and

weaker, and, like an expiring taper, is extinguished by the influence of the most

trivial causes." Dr. Thomson, after noticing the amount of deaths in England
by starvation, or purely from want of food, also says, " how many persons

died by piecemeal starvation, or by disease engendered by bad food or want

of it, has not yet been pointed out by statistical data." Though we may not

be able to trace the effects of destitution in its different stages on the increase
of disease and death, yet by the improvement of registers, and by greater
attention to the vital statistics of various localities, and of different classes of

the people, more certain knowledge may be attained on this most important
subject. The proof, however, which the preceding tables afford that the mor-
tality for the different towns is in proportion to the amount of the poor and
destitute in these towns, is supported by the amount of burials which take,
place in them at the public expense.

     Report of the Committee for the Reduction of Lacaille's Stars.

                                                                                                 Collingwood, June 3, 1842:

A Committee having been appointed, consisting of myself, Mr. Henderson,

and Mr. Airy, for the purpose of effecting the reduction of Lacaille's stars, I
have the pleasure to report, that under the superintendence of Mr. Hender-
son, the whole of that work is now completed, and the resulting catalogue,
being arranged in order of right ascension, is fairly written out and ready for

--the press. The total number of stars reduced and catalogued is about 10,000,
   the sum of 105/. remaining of the original grant unappropriated; which the
Committee recommend to be applied (with such additional grant as may be
needed) to the printing and publication of the catalogue, without which, it is
evident, that little or no benefit can result to Astronomical Science from the
work so accomplished. With the catalogue, and forming an introduction to

it, an account of the process pursued in the reductions, the constants used,
and all other matter needful for a complete understanding of the work, ought
also to be printed, and should it be the pleasure of the Association to order

the publication, will be furnished by Mr. Henderson. The estimated cost of
the publication so recommended, may be roughly stated at about 250/. for
printing, paper, &c. of 500 copies of the catalogue and introduction.

                                                                  J. F. W. Herschel.

Report of the Committee for the Reduction of the Stars in the Histoire

Celeste.

                                  June 16, 1842.

I have the satisfaction of reporting that the whole of the stars in the ' His-
toire Celeste ' have been reduced, agreeably to the method proposed : those

only being omitted for which there are no tables of reduction; and that there
is now remaining, of the grant for this purpose, the sum of £9, which will
not be required in the further prosecution of this portion of the work. But
the main object of this undertaking will be defeated, if the catalogue be not
printed for general use and information. The number of stars reduced is up-
wards of 47,000 ; and I have caused' an estimate to be made of the expense

of printing 500 copies in an octavo form. And it appears that the cost of
paper and printing will be about £415, but that 1000 copies will cost £100

more. There is, however, another expense which must be taken into the ac-

count, which is the copying of the catalogue, in a proper order for the press,
and the correction of the press during the printing, which I apprehend will
be £60 or £70 more. Taking the whole of those estimates together, it would
appear that 500 copies would cost about £500, and that 1000 copies would
cost about £600. Should the British Association decide on the printing of
the catalogue, I would draw up a statement of the method pursued in making
the reductions, together with such other remarks as might be requisite. This

probably would not add another sheet to the work.

--206 report 1842.

Report of the Committee on the British Association Catalogue of Stars.

I have the honour to report on the subject of this catalogue, that the cal-

culations of the places of the stars, with the annual precessions, secular va-

riations, and proper motions, together with the logarithms of the requisite
constants, are completed for nearly 8300 stars, which is about the number

--originally contemplated ; that the same are fairly copied out for the

press ; and that the construction of the table of synonyms is now in pro-
gress, two-thirds of which ' are already completed ; that the whole of the
sum granted at the last meeting of the Association has been expended, and
that a further sum of £25 will be required for the completion of some of the

above stars in peculiar positions, and for the final completion of the syno-

nyms                        that the above sum of £25 is all that will  be wanting in future, as Mr.
                         ;

Farley (the principal computer and superintendent) has undertaken to com-

plete the work, ready for the press, without any further remuneration, and

which will be ready for delivery in a few weeks. Under these circumstances, I

have caused an estimate to be made of the expense of printing the same : and

I find, that the CQst of paper and printing 500 copies in quarto, will be about

£550, but that 1000 copies will cost £150 more. It will be requisite, how-

ever, to employ some one to correct the press, and to superintend the arrange-

Ament of the work, which will add to the expense here mentioned.                                                                                      pretty

large preface will be requisite, explanatory of the mode adopted in bringing

up the several stars to the given epoch, and of various circumstances connect-

ed with the investigation, as well as descriptive of the method of using the

catalogue in its present form. But on these points I am willing to render

any assistance in my power.                                                                                                                 Francis Baily.

On the erection of one of Mr. Osier's Anemometers at Inverness, one

   of the Stations at which Hourly Observations with the Barometer
   and Thermometer have been made at the ' request of the British

   Association. By Sir David Brewster.

Owing to the difficulty of obtaining a suitable place for the erection of the
anemometer, the observations did not commence till the 15th of April. The
indications of the rain-gauge commenced on the 6th of May, so that a com-

plete series of observations for one year will be laid before the meeting of the
Association for 1813. The observations are registered and superintended by

Mr. Thomas Mackenzie and the Rev. Mr. Gray, Rector of the Royal Academy

of Inverness.

8 h 33 m a.m. and 7 b 42'", the critical interval being ll h 9m , differing only a

few minutes from the result obtained by similar hourly observations made at

Leith. The observations made with the barometer, when reduced to the

level of the sea, and to the temperature of 60°, indicate very distinctly the

daily variation, with its two maxima and minima. The mean annual average

of all the observations was 29*680 inches. The monthly mean indicated a

maximum iu December and in June, and a minimum in March and in October.

Letter from Dr. Lamont of Munich to Col. Sabine on the System of

     Meteorological and Magnetical Observations on the Continent.

                                    Munich, June 12, 1842.

My --Mydear Sir,  time has been so entirely taken up with magnetic expe-

riments and the usual business of the observatory, that I am sorry to say I have

been unable to draw up the report I intended to lay before the Council of the

British Association on the system of meteorological and magnetical observations

lately commenced on the Continent. I therefore request you, merely for the

present, to mention, that the system in general is the same as that of the "So-

cietas Palatina" instituted at Manheim in 1780. At the most part of our

stations only the meteorological instruments are observed ; at the principal

places magnetic observations are also made three or four times a day. The

results are given in the ' Annalen fur Meteorologie und Erdmagnetismus,'

published by Prof. Grunert of Greifswald, Prof. Roller of Kremsmunster,

Prof. Kreil of Prague, Prof. Plieninger of Stuttgard, Prof. Stieffel of Carl-

sruhe and myself. Prof. Grunert furnishes meteorological and magnetic

observations made by himself at Greifswald, and meteorological observations

made at five other stations in the North of Prussia. Prof. Kreil and Prof.

Koller send observations from Prague (magnetic term days), Kremsmunster

(magnetic and meteorological observations), Milan (magnetic observations),

Pavia, Venice, Lemberg, Ofen (meteorological observations). Prof. Plieninger

has superintended for many years the meteorological observations made in
Wurtemberg : the number of stations is eleven. The whole of these observa-
tions will now be published in the ' Annalen.' Prof. Stieffel communicates

the observations made by himself at Carlsruhe. Besides, he is now arrang-

ing meteorological observations at many other places in Baden ; twenty-five

of these places have been furnished with instruments from the observatory of
Munich. The observations in Bavaria are superintended by myself: the

system has already been mentioned at the meeting of the Association at Glas-

Agow.  considerable addition has been made of late, the members of the

" Pfalzische Gesellschaft " in the Rhine province having joined us wi{h

twenty-three stations. Contributions for the ' Annalen ' (regular series of

meteorological or magnetic observations) have been promised by Prof. Kaiser

of Leyden, Prof, van Rees of Utrecht, Prof. Wenckebach of Breda, Prof.

Moebius of Leipzig, Prof. Reich of Freyburg (Saxony), Prof. Weisse of

Cracau, M. Becker of Cronberg (near Frankfurt), M. Voigt of Bensberg
(military school near Cologne), M. Littrow of Vienna, Prof. Kottinger of
Salzburg, Prof. Gintl of Gratz, M. Valz of Marseilles, M. Colla, Director of
the meteorological observatory of Parma. Communications may be expect-
ed (though I do not know at present to what extent) from Prof. Fournet at
Lyons, M. Amici at Florence, M. Capocci at Naples, M. Keserii, Director of

the Observatory of Carlsburg (near the Turkish frontier). In Greece, a mag-

netic station and several meteorological stations are shortly to be established.

A very extensive correspondence is carried on at present, and if the future

success is equal to the past, there is reason to expect that in a short time the

' Annalen ' will present a regular and systematic meteorological account of

the vast tract between the Pyrenees and the Russian frontier. In communica-

ting this to the British Association, I must request you to mention that the
undertaking was commenced only seven months ago ; at the same time I beg to

express my regret that other avocations have prevented me from laying a full

report of our proceedings before the Association ; I hope, however, I shall be

able to do so at the next meeting.

208 report-- 1842.

Report of the Committee for the Reduction of Meteorological Obser-

                                                             vations.

It was the earnest wish of your Committee to have made their final report
on this subject at the present meeting ; owing, however, to the severe illness
of Mr. Birt, to whom the execution of the reduction and projection of the
observations has been intrusted, and his subsequent change of residence,
together with the unusually early period of the meeting this year, it must be
deferred yet another year. Meanwhile the annexed letter from that gentle-
man will show the present state of the inquiry and the progress made :

                                                                             47 Leicester Square, June 6, 1842.

--" Dear Sir, I regret exceedingly that I am unable to send you a greater

number of the projected curves than those now inclosed, which nearly com-

plete the European series, including the British isles, during the years 1836,

--1837 and 1838. The following are the stations omitted: Greenwich, two

sets in 1836; Geneva, June 1837; Turin, March, June, September and

December 1837; Kremsmiinster, March 1838; Gibraltar, March and June

1837; and Cadiz, for 1837 and March 1838. The Turin curves were

omitted in consequence of the reduction of sidereal to mean time not having

been accomplished, and the remainder, with the exception of Greenwich, not

presenting those marked features of agreement which are so conspicuous

in most of the others.

" I have just discovered that the European curves for December 1836 have

not been projected, and as the time of the meeting is now so rapidly approach-

ing, I have thought it best to forward those completed without waiting for

this sheet, which I will immediately proceed with.

   " I have not included the tables which I have been unable to complete,

principally in consequence of my illness during the autumn, which, with the
loss of strength resulting therefrom, prevented my close attention to them for
nearly four months. Had this not have occurred, I have no doubt the whole

of the projections and tables would have been completed by this time.

 --" I inclose in this parcel the American curves formerly sent, namely, De-
--cember 1835, and March 1838, as I considered it probable that you might

wish to see the contemporaneous observations on each side of the Atlantic. I

have also included South Africa and Asia for June 1836.

" I have had no time on this occasion to look over the sheets previous to

sending them to you ; in the mere glance I have given them the curves of
December 1837 strike me as peculiarly interesting, especially the fall west-

ward and the rise eastward of Brussels.

not having had the whole completed,

In reference to the Report which had been requested from Mr. A. D. Baclie
of Philadelphia, relative to the meteorology of the United States of America,
Col. Sabine made the following statement to the Section. " Our valued

corresponding member Mr. Bache has requested me to explain to the Sec-
tion the causes which have prevented him from completing in time for the

present meeting the report which has been just called for. Mr. Bache was re-

quested to prepare this report at the Meeting at Newcastle in 1838, which he

personally attended; it was also at that Meeting that the system originated of

combined magnetical and meteorological observations which is now in full and

successful action, and in which various governments and scientific individuals

of all nations participate. In our own and most other countries the expenses of

the establishments at which these observations are made have been defrayed

from national funds ; but in the United States this has not been done ; and

the task of procuring the necessary funds by private subscription for the

magnetic observatory at Philadelphia has been undertaken by Mr. Bache, in

addition to that of establishing it and superintending its progress. His exer-

tions in carrying into effect the wishes of the Association on this subject have

engrossed the time which he could otherwise have devoted to the preparation

Weof the report on the meteorology of the United States.  may, however,

expect that the report will be ready for a future meeting, and I need not say

to those who are acquainted with Mr. Bache's qualifications, that whenever

presented it cannot fail to form a very valuable contribution to our Transac-

tions." In reference to the progress and present state of the magnetic ob-

servatory at Philadelphia, Colonel Sabine read the following communication

from Mr. Bache.
                                                                            " Philadelphia, May 10, 1842.

 --"My dear Colonel, As I shall not have the advantage of joining the

magneticians in June, will you report to Section A. what we have been doing

here in concert with them ? The bi-hourly observations of declination and

horizontal and vertical force have been carried on regularly since their com-

mencement in June 1840, as well as the term-day observations. The me-

teorological instruments, including the barometer, the dry and wet bulb ther-

mometer, Daniell's hygrometer, the blackened bulb and radiation thermome-

ters, have also been observed at the intervals assigned in the general instruc-

tions. Osier's self-registering anemometer and rain-gauge have been kept

at work. Saussure's hair hygrometer has been observed for comparison.

The meteorological term-days have been kept as well as the magnetic, making

two during the month. These observations have been made with instruments

and in an observatory belonging to the Girard College of Philadelphia, and

have been kept up by voluntary contributions, chiefly from members of the

American Philosophical Society, and by funds furnished by the Society.

  " We have made some changes in the instruments which we consider im-

provements. Since January 1841 the vertical-force instrument has been

provided with a mirror, and is observed at a distance, like the declination and

horizontal-force instruments of Gauss. The only disadvantage which has

occurred in this is an increase in the correction for temperature, but the fa-

cility and certainty of the observations compensate for this. The arrange-

ment of the force part of the Anemometer ha3 been greatly improved by

connecting the plate which receives the action of the wind with slightly-

curved brass bars, or springs, placed at the side of the registering table

the action of the instrument is thus rendered much more regular. As we
have much snow in the course of a season, it was a problem of some inter-

est to measure its fall by the registering apparatus : this has been effected

by raising the temperature of the funnel of the gauge slightly above the

freezing point, by vapour from a boiler within the observatory.
    " During the first year the observatory was not heated artificially, but the

large and uncertain amount of the corrections for temperature induced me to

adopt a different course during the past winter, and without any of the bad

results which I had apprehended from currents of air. The instruments,

1842.  p
210 REPORT---1842.

however, are the large ones of the German makers. In regard to the cor-

rection for temperature of the horizontal-force instrument, I arrived at no
satisfactory result by the ordinary method of obtaining it. This winter an
approximation to the correction has been obtained by allowing the observa-
tory to cool down on Sunday. If we had had a second set of instruments

for comparison these results would have been unexceptionable ; as it is, the

method of vibrating a declinometer bar and of observing a portable vertical-

force instrument for comparison, led to no satisfactory result. Had the winter

been of its usual severity so as to give us a result every week, this comparison

would have been of less consequence.
   "Having ascertained by the observations in 1840 and 1841 nearly the

hours of maximum and minimum of the magnetic phenomena, I have during
the present year caused observations to be made within those limits as fre-
quently as on term-days. As these observations occupy, with moderate

intervals, the whole twenty-four hours, I hope to be able to render a better

account of disturbances than heretofore. This makes me more than ever
anxious to keep up the observatory during the present year. The regular

bi-hourly observations form a part of this series.
   " You have doubtless a report from the observatory at Harvard, and know

how zealously they are at work. Mr. Gilliss, of the navy, keeps up his ob-
servations of the declination and vertical force at the observatory at Wash-

ington city.
    " In reference to our knowledge of the magnetic elements in different parts

of the United States, the work goes bravely on. Prof. Loomis has contri-

buted within the year a large quota in his observations of dip, chiefly in

Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. Mr. Nicolet has observed in the same

region, and has added a few observations of horizontal intensity to those of
the dip. You will see an account of these results in the Proceedings of the

American Philosophical Society, and at a later day in their Transactions.
Dr. Locke has also made his contribution, which you will find in Silliman's
Journal. I completed last summer a systematic survey of Pennsylvania com-

menced the year before, and hope to be able to calculate the observations du-
ring the coming vacation. The observations were for declination, dip, and hori-

zontal intensity at the chief stations, and for dip and total intensity by Lloyd's

method, at the subsidiary points. By observations made at the same station
with different instruments, it appears that we now have several dipping circles
which may be relied on to furnish accordant results, and they are in hands
which will not let any opportunity pass of using them. The visit of Lieut.

Lefroy will doubtless stimulate us to further exertion by showing an example

of activity near.

   " The Association have now a great work before them in drawing out of

the results at the magnetic and meteorological observatories the interesting

laws which they must furnish. Wishing you and your co-labourers all

success,                       "I remain, very truly yours,

translations were presented to the Committee by Lieut.- Col. Sabine, and as
no illustrations were requisite, it has not been necessary to expend any por-

tion of the grant placed at the disposal of the Committee.

       On the Mode of conducting Experiments on the Resistance of Air.
                       By Eaton Hodgkinson, F.R.S.

Mr. Hodgkinson said, that, having been honoured by the Association with
a request to pursue some experiments on the resistance of the air, he was de-
sirous of exhibiting an instrument prepared for making the first series of those
experiments. He proposed, in the first instance, to seek for the force of the
wind moving at different velocities upon plane surfaces of given dimensions,

these surfaces being either perpendicular, or inclined at any angle, to its cur-
rent : to determine this, he intended to place the apparatus upon the front of
the first carriage of a railway train ; the road along which the train passed

having for a short distance poles stuck up, 100 or 200 yards asunder. He

would try the experiment only on days when there was no perceptive wind
and then, if the time in seconds taken in passing between two poles be care-
fully observed, and the pressure indicated upon the discs (which were of

two and of four feet area, both round and square), the resistance per square

foot, with a given velocity, would be obtained. He hoped to determine these

facts, with various velocities and at different angles of inclination in the discs ;
trying the same experiments with both discs at the same time, to ascertain
whether the resistance to a square surface and a round one, of equal area, was
the same, and that the results might correct each other. The directors of the
Manchester and Birmingham Railway had kindly consented, at Mr. Buck's
request, to allow him to make these experiments ; and he was indebted to Mr.
Fairbairn for the apparatus. This was placed on the table. It consists of two
discs of wood (which may be of any form), made inclinable at any angle by

means of screws, and having an attached quadrant to measure the angle. To

ascertain the force of the wind, one of Salter's balance springs is placed be-
hind each disc, attached to the cross piece which connects the two rods of the
discs ; and this, it was expected, would indicate the force of the wind at any
moment. If other apparatus were found necessary it would be applied.

   Experimental Inquiries on the Strength of Stones and other Materials.

                        By Eaton Hodgkinson, F.R.S.

After noticing the present state of knowledge on this subject, and the
experiments of Barlow, Rennie, and experimentalists on the continent, Mr.
Hodgkinson said, he had long felt anxious to ascertain how the three forces

-- --the crushing, the tensile, and the transverse strength and the position

of the neutral line (that separating the extended and compressed fibres

--in a bent body) were connected in bodies generally : and his experiments

had for several years been directed to discovering facts upon each of these
matters, in order to determine the question. His experiments some years
ago, made for the British Association, with respect to the values of hot and

cold blast iron, had shown that the ratio of the forces of ultimate tension
and compression was nearly constant in all the species of cast iron ; and a
few experiments made at that time on sandstone and marble, had led him to
suspect that nearly the same would be the case in these and other hard bo-
dies. Through the liberality of his friend Mr. Fairbairn (who had, as usual,

given him every assistance his establishment afforded,), he (Mr. Hodgkinson)

had made a great many experiments upon wood, sandstones, marbles, glass, slate,

ivory, bone, &c, to ascertain the tensile, crushing, and transverse strength of

Heeach ; also, as far as possible, the situation of the neutral line.  had sought

for these in thirteen kinds of timber, including oaks, pines, teak, &c. ; all the

different sorts of experiments were made, as far as possible, out of the same

specimen in each case. The wood was of good quality, and perfectly dry, having
been chosen for this purpose, and laid in a warm dry place for four years or

more. After describing the mode and character of his experiments on the va-

rious substances named above (specimens of which he produced), Mr. Hodg-

kinson gave the following summary of their comparative results on marbles

and stones of various degrees of hardness :

   The ratio of the crushing force to the transverse force i3 nearly the same in
glass, stone, and marble, including the hardest and the softest kinds. Hence,
if we know the transverse strength in any of these bodies, we may predict the
other ; and, as glass and the hardest stones resist crushing with from seven to
nine times the energy that they do being torn asunder, we may get an ap-
proximate value of the tensile force from the crushing force, or vice versa.
These results render it probable that the hardest bodies, whether cast-iron,

glass, stone, or marble, admit of certain atomic displacements, either in tear-
ing asunder or crushing ; these displacements being in a given ratio to each
 other, or nearly so. In future calculations as to the strength of bodies, the
crushing strength ought to be made the fundamental datum, for the reasons
shown in this notice. The ratio of the transverse strength to the crushing
strength is greater in cast-iron than in glass, marble, and sandstones, arising

from the ductility of that metal. The necessity of enlarged inquiries in these
matters will be seen, when it is reflected that calculations of the tensile strength
of cast-iron, or marble, or stones in general, made from the transverse strength
by the modes used by Tredgold, Navier, and others, give the tensile strength
twice or three times as great as it ought to be. The paper, of which a short
notice is here given, will, when completed according to the author's wish, be

offered to the Royal Society.

                  Report of the Committee for Deep Dredging.

Mr. Patterson stated that the Dredging Committee were continuing to

collect the materials for their Report on the Marine Zoology of Britain, and
announced the results of dredging at depths varying from fifty to one hun-
dred and forty-five fathoms, off the Mull of Galloway, by Captain Beechey,

To the Committee of the British Associationfor advancing our know-
                               ledge of British Belemnites.

In consequence of receiving from the British Association, through the Com-

mittee appointed at Plymouth in 1841, "for the purpose of advancing our

knowledge of Belemnites," the sum of 50/., I have renewed the preparations

for publishing the Figures and Descriptions of British Belemnites, which

were presented (by request) to the Meeting of the Association at Dublin.

Notwithstanding the lapse of time since that meeting, but few additional spe-

cies have come to my knowledge, though doubtless such may be known to

other geologists. I propose, by circulating proof plates already engraved,

and of others in progress, to collect information regarding the localities of

the known, and the nature of any new species, before printing the descrip-

tions already prepared ; but I hope to lay before the Committee, previous to

or at the meeting in 1842, specimen pages and plates for their consideration ;
and I entertain no doubt that previous to the meeting in 1843, if not in the
beginning of that year, I may be able to complete and publish the work. It

is proposed to print in quarto, on the same size and general plan as the works

of Voltz and Blainville : there will be from ten to twenty plates, arranged

with as much regard both to natural affinity and geological position as prac-

ticable. The number of plates already in hand is six.

             Correction of an Error in this part of the Report for 1841.

In the Addendum to the Report of the Transactions of the Sections in 1839, one of
the documents, viz. the Letter on p. 5, from Mr. Phillips to Mr. Nasmyth, dated Au-

--gust 10, 1840, is incorrectly terminated. The last sentence of the letter should have

been in these words: " Should you, however, instead of this easy and obvious mode
of correcting any error of mine, resolve to appeal to another tribunal, the public, I
can make no other objection than that I fear you will not have chosen the course
most advantageous to your views," instead of " Should you, however, instead of this
easy and obvious method of correcting any error of mine, resolve to appeal to another

tribunal, the public, I will give you the only proof in my power to offer of an un-

biassed mind, by transmitting copies of all the letters I have received from you, to
render any statement you may think proper to make as complete as possible."

   The mistake was pointed out by Mr. Nasmyth, in a communication to the Presi-
dent, dated June 7th, 1842, and appears to have occurred in the following manner :

--There was a prior draft of the same letter, and this by some mistake was preserved,

and after a very long interval of time was, with other documents in Mr. Phillips's
possession, bearing upon the subject, sent to be examined by the authority of the
Council. It was this draft, supposed to have been followed in the actual letter, that
the printer copied, and hence the error which Mr. Nasmyth has pointed out.

       MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.

       On the Astronomical Clock. By M. Bessel of Konigsberg.

Having ever been of opinion that the most indispensable of astronomical instru-

ments, the transit-clock, will only acquire the greatest possible perfectness, if the

pendulum, separated from the wheel-work, is made to vibrate in equal time, whatever
the temperature and the arc may be, I beg leave to communicate to this Associa-

tion some hints relative to this matter. Some artists have endeavoured to compen-

sate a variation of the arc, from summer to winter, by not completely compensating

the pendulum for the variation of heat; others have contrived very ingenious means

for producing always an equal arc. But experience, at least my own, has shown no

so complete success, that astronomers, though they feel themselves truly indebted to

the skill and the ingenuity of artists, should not be tempted to wish that further en-

deavours might not be considered as useless.

Some years ago, Mr. Frodsham communicated to this Association a very ingenious

contrivance, which he calls the isochronal piece, the purpose of which is to compensate,

by the effect of the suspension spring, that of a variation of the arc. Supposing that

experiments of this universally celebrated artist have shown this contrivance to answer

the purpose, there will be no longer a difficulty in making the rate of a pendulum in-

dependent, as well of the arc as of the heat. What I wish to submit to his judge-
ment, is only whether the very expeditious method of coincidences might not be em-

ployed for checking a pendulum in both respects. The pendulum, without the clock,

being suspended from the wall, a clock, taken out of its case, may be placed before it

at a distance of 6 or 8 feet ; an object-glass, of 3 or 4 feet focal length, may be placed

between both, so that it produces, exactly at the lower end of the pendulum of the
                                                                                                                      '

clock, an image of the lower end of the other. Then the coincidences of both pendu-

lums may be very accurately observed with a telescope, placed in the straight line

Awith both, at a convenient distance.  similar contrivance has been described in the

account of pendulum experiments made at Kbnigsberg; and I may here be permitted

to add, that the accuracy of the method is such, that the relative rate of both pendu-

lums may be ascertained with the required accuracy in a time of ten or twenty minutes.

This arrangement supposed, it will be very easy to adjust tbe isochronal piece of Mr.

Frodsham. After this has been effected, the rate of the pendulum is to be tried in dif-

Aferent temperatures.  box, having at its lower end an opening covered with glass,

Amay be fastened to the wall, so that the pendulum swings within it.  couple of

metal tubes pass through this box, and may be heated by boiling water or steam, in

order to heat the air within the box. Previously to the heating, the air is to be de-

prived of its moisture. Two or three thermometers will show whether the heat within

is pretty uniform. The pendulum being swung before and after the heating, it will

be easy to correct the compensation for heat.

   I believe that not only the readiness with which both these experiments may be
made, but also the perfect isolation of the pendulum will recommend this method to

artists and astronomers. I have indeed been desirous of trying it myself before pro-

posing it to others, but having been delayed beyond expectation with the construction

of a pendulum provided with Mr. Frodsham's isochronal piece, I am obliged to leave

the experiment to others.
   With respect to the construction of the pendulum, I believe that attention should

be paid to one point of view, which hitherto seems to have been overlooked. It often
happens that thermometers fixed at the top and at the foot of the case of a clock do
not agree ; whence it is evident that a compensation acting only below will not always
compensate the variation of the length of the whole rod. I should prefer, for this
reason, the gridiron pendulum to the mercurial pendulum, especially if the former is
constructed in such a manner that the several rods begin as little as possible below the

point of suspension, and end at the centre of gravity of the lens. I should also think
proper to make the several rods of equal diameter, and to coat them uniformly. Per-
haps the application of galvanism, which the deservedly famed Mr. Dent has made
for coating the balance-spring of chronometers with gold, would best answer the pur-
pose. I finally believe that the utmost care in the construction of the pendulum is
very essential, in order to remove every danger of its derangement by the spring of

the metals.

Supposing a pendulum perfectly regulated, as well with respect to the heat as to

the arc of vibrations, only one cause will interfere with the regularity of its vibration
time ; this is the effect of that part of the buoyancy of the air which depends upon
the variations of the height of the barometer. The other part, depending upon the

variations of the thermometer, is comprised in the adjustment of the compensation for

heat, if made by the above-described process. There is indeed the possibility to com-
pensate the former part too, by fastening a barometer-tube to the pendulum ; and it
would not be difficult to find the suitable diameter of this tube ; but I am aware that
this complication of the pendulum would be rather inconvenient. At all events, the

effect of the variations of the barometer is not very great, especially if the specific
gravity of the pendulum is made as great as possible.

The pendulum of a clock being carefully adjusted, every variation of the rate of the

clock, not explicable by a variation of the barometer, will originate in the escapement
or the wheels. Though the uniformity of the rate of many clocks is more to be won-

dered at than their occasional small variations, yet I believe that further improve-
ments are possible, and that they only will be obtained by the separation of the causes

of perturbations. From this point of view I might consider it as very desirable severely
to test the isolated pendulum by the method which I have submitted to the judgement

of the celebrated artists, whose admired works have lately so greatly contributed to the

accuracy, as well of astronomical observations as of the determination of longitudes.

On a New General Principle of Analytical Mechanics. By M. Jacobi of

                                                       Kbnigsberg.

   In the different problems relative to the motion of a system of material points which

have been hitherto considered, one may make an important and curious remark, " that
            TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                            3

whenever the forces are functions of the coordinates of the moving points only, and

the problem is reduced to the integration of a differential equation of the first order

of two variables, it may also be reduced to quadratures." Now I have succeeded in

proving the general truth of this remark, which appears to constitute a new principle

of mechanics. This principle, as well as the other general principles of mechanics,

makes known an integral, but with this difference, that whilst the latter give the first
integrals of the dynamical differential equations, the new principle gives the last. It
possesses a generality very superior to that of other known principles, inasmuch as it

applies to cases in which, when the analytical expressions of the forces, as well as the
equations by which we express the nature of the system, are composed of the coordi-

nates of the moveables in any manner whatever, principles (such as the principle of

the conservation of living forces, of the conservation of areas, and of the conservation,
of the centre of gravity) are superior to the new principle in several respects. In, the

first place, these principles afford a finite equation between the coordinates of the

moveables and the components of their velocities, whilst the integral found by the
new principle is simply reduced to quadratures. In the second place, we suppose in
the application of the new principle that we have already succeeded in discovering
all the integrals but one, a supposition which will be realized in a small number of
problems only. This will be sufficient to convince us of the importance of the new

principle ; but this may be made still more manifest, if I am permitted to illustrate

its application by a few examples.

   1st. Let us consider the orbit described by a planet in its motion round the sun.

The differential equations in dynamical problems being of the second order, we may

present them under the form of differential equations of the first order, by introducing

the first differentials as new variables. In this manner the determination of the orbit

of the planet will depend upon the integration of three differential equations of the

Wefirst order between four variables.  find two integrals by the principles of living

forces (forces vives) and areas. The question is thus reduced to the integration of a
single differential equation of two variables and of the first order. Now, by my gene-
ral theorem, this integration may always be reduced to quadratures. If therefore we
choose to reckon this theorem amongst the other principles of mechanics, we see that

the general principles of mechanics alone are sufficient to reduce the determination of

the orbit of a planet to quadratures.

2nd. Let us consider the motion of a point attracted to two centres of force, after

Newton's law of gravitation. The initial velocity being directed in the plane passing
through the body and the two centres of attraction, we still have to integrate three

differential equations of the first order amongst four variables, one integral of these

equations being furnished by the principle of living forces. Euler has discovered an-

other, and thus has succeeded in reducing the problem to a differential equation of
the first order between two variables. But this equation was so complicated, that any

person but this intrepid geometer would have shrunk from the idea of attempting its

myintegration and reducing it to quadratures. Now, by  general principle, this re-

duction would have been effected by a general rule without any tentative process,

without any extraordinary effort of the mind.
   3rd. Let us consider also the famous problem of the rotatory movement of a solid

body round a fixed point, the body being under the influence of no accelerating force.

In this problem we shall have to integrate five differential equations of the first order

amongst six variables. The principle of living forces gives one integral, that of areas

Wemygives three others, and the fifth is found by
                                                     new principle.  thus see all the

integrals of this difficult problem found by the general principles of mechanics alone,
without our being required to write a single formula, or even to make a choice of

variables.

I will endeavour now to enunciate the rule itself, by means of which the last inte-

gration to be effected in the problems of mechanics is found to be reduced to quadra-

tures, the forces being always functions of the coordinates alone. Let us suppose, in
the first instance, any system whatsoever of material points entirely free. Let there

=be found a first integral /' const., the variables which enter into the function /'

being the coordinates of the moveables, and their first differentials taken with respect

to the time. I avail myself of the equation

                                       /' es const,

for the purpose of eliminating any one of the variables, and I call p' the partial differ-

--4 REPORT 1842.

=ence of/', taken with respect to this variable. Let/" const, be a second integral.

By means of this equation I eliminate a second variable, and I call p" the partial dif-

ference of /" with respect to this variable. Let us suppose that we know all the in-
/=tegrals of the problem but one, and that with respect to each integral
                                                                          const, we

seek the corresponding partial difference^ with respect to the variable, which we elimi-

nate by means of this integral. The number of variables exceeds by unity that of

the integrals : we eliminate by means of each integral a new variable, and we thus

succeed in expressing all the variables by means of two of them. Let us call these

two variables x and y and x' and y', their first differentials taken with respect to the

Wetime.  shall express by means of .r and y the quantities x' and y', as well as all

the quantities p', p", &c. : since x' and y' are the first differentials of x and y taken

with respect to the time, we shall have the equation

                            -- --y' dx x1 dy 0,

where x' and y' are known functions of the two variables a- and y. It is this differen-
tial equation, the last of all of them, which we must integrate in order to obtain the

complete solution of the problem. Now I show that on dividing this equation by the
product of the variables p', p", &c, its first member becomes an exact differential, and

therefore the integration of this equation is generally reduced to quadratures.

   When we have any system whatsoever of material points, the simplicity of the pre-
ceding theorem is in no respect altered, provided we give to the dynamical differen-

tial equations that remarkable form under which they have been presented for the

first time by the illustrious Astronomer Royal of Dublin, and under which they ought

to be presented hereafter in all the general researches of analytical mechanics. It is

true that the formulas of Sir W. Hamilton are referrible only to the cases where the

components of the forces are the partial differences of the same function of the coordi-
nates; but it has not been found to be difficult to make the changes which are neces-
sary in order that these formulas may become applicable to the general case, where

the forces are any functions whatever of the coordinates.

   When the time enters explicitly into the analytical expressions for the forces, and

into the equations of condition of the system, the principle of the final multiplier,

found by a general rule, is applicable also to this class of dynamical problems. There
are also some particular problems into which enters the resistance of a medium, which
give rise to similar theorems. It is the case of a planet revolving round the sun in a
medium whose resistance is proportional to any power of the velocity of the planet.

   The analysis which has conducted me to the new general principle of analytical
mechanics, which I have the honour to communicate to the Association, may be ap-
plied to a great number of questions in the integral calculus. I have collected these
different applications in a very extensive memoir, which I hope to publish upon my

return to Kbnigsberg, and which I shall have the honour of presenting to the Asso-

ciation as soon as it shall be printed.

Extract from a Memoir entitled " Considerations on the Principles of Ana-

         lytical 3Iechanics." By Professor Braschmann of Moscow.

   The principle of virtual velocities, on which is based the theory of equilibrium

and of motion, has not, in my opinion, been explained in a manner which is clear
and unobjectionable ; and I am also inclined to believe that the problem of equili-

brium has not been treated analytically in a point of view sufficiently general, and
that there are still many observations to be made on the correctness of the applica-
tion of the principle of virtual velocities to certain problems.

   Similar observations may be made also with regard to the theory of motion. M.
Ostrogradsky brought forward, some years ago, some new and general ideas on the
laws of equilibrium and of motion in two memoirs, one of which bears the title, " On
the Momenta of Forces ;" and the other, " On the instantaneous Displacements of

the points of a System." Profiting by his enlightened views, I published, in 1837,
a treatise in the Russian language on the equilibrium of solid and fluid bodies, from

which I will now give a very short extract relating to the method I have there fol-
lowed, and I shall add some observations which escaped me at the time of the pub-

lication of that work, respecting the number and the character of conditions of

equilibrium.

In the first place, I demonstrate the parallelogram of forces*, and then pass on to the

composition and decomposition of forces, and to the equilibrium of a free point.

To find the conditions of a point, or of a system of points, which is not free, it is

necessary, and at the same time sufficient, that the forces cannot effect any displace-

ment which the obstacles allow of, or that they can only produce impossible displace-

ments. It is this condition which we will endeavour to express analytically.

I show that a force acting on a point subjected to a certain obstacle can never give

rise to a displacement, forming either a right or obtuse angle with the direction of

the force, but that it can cause a displacement which forms an acute angle with the

direction of this force. As a point can sometimes. only be displaced in a straight

line by an infinitely small quantity, I shall only consider infinitely small displace-

ments, but perfectly arbitrary. I will designate one of these displacements by ds,

and its projections on the rectangular axes x, y, z, by dx, dy, dz, then the condition*

R _that a force cannot cause a displacement d s will be expressed by cos (R d s)                                                             ;

Rwhere X, Y, Z are the projections of on the three axes x, y, z. Let us now see how

we can express the condition that the displacement of a point subjected to obstacles

is possible, independently of the means which may occasion this displacement.
For this purpose I observe, that whatever may be the condition which hinders some

displacements, it may always be represented by one or by several fixed planes. I sup-

pose, at first, that there is but one sole plane of dimensions infinitely small which

prevents the displacement of the point. I imagine a normal prolonged from the

         r  .                                          point in space where the displacement is possible, and I de-
                                                       signate the angles of this normal with the axes x, y, z, by

                                                       possible as form a right or acute angle with the normal, i. e.

and the whole of these conditions (1.) and (2.) will be the analytical expression that
a force cannot effect a possible displacement, the projections of which are dx, dy, dz.

   Let us see what conclusions we should draw from these two inequalities for the

equilibrium of a point.

  For the sake of shortness, I make Adx+Bdy + Cdz=dL, where d L ex-

presses an arbitrary quantity infinitely small, which is the complete differential of a

function of the three variables x, y, ss, or simply an infinitely small one, which does

not possess this property ; I add to this equation two others, perfectly arbitrary,

--8 REPORT 1842.

On the Report of the Commissio?iers for tlie restoration of lost standards of
   Weights and Measures, and upon their proposal for the introduction oj a
  Decimal System. By the Dean of Ely.

After stating that the impei-ial standards of weights and measures (the yard, the pound,

the gallon, and several of their multiples) had been lost in the fire which destroyed

the two Houses of Parliament, the author said that a commission (of which he was a

member) had been appointed to report on the best means of restoring these standards.

The commission recommended to the government that the standards of length and

weight should be independent of each other, which was not the case before. The

standard pound weight was Troy weight (5780 grains), though the pound avoirdupois

(7000 grains) was used throughout the country, in the proportion, perhaps, of 10,000 to

one of Troy. The commission recommended that, hereafter, the use of the Trey

pound should be abolished, except for a very limited number of transactions, and that

the avoirdupois pound should be considered as the standard pound of Great Britain.

--They recommended that measures of capacity should be determined by measures of

weight by far the most convenient method, inasmuch as weighing was a much more

accurate operation than, for instance, the formation of a perfect cube. The commis-

sion also ventured to recommend strongly some alterations in the coinage, and the

systems of weights and measures, arising out of a more extensive introduction of the

decimal scale. The nearly unanimous determination of the commission was, that any

attempt to interfere materially with the primary units of the coinage, weights and

measures in ordinary use, would produce much confusion and bad consequences in

the ordinary transactions of life. They would therefore adhere strictly to ajl those

primary units, viz. the pound sterling, the yard (and also the foot, for there were two

primary units in this measure), the acre, the gallon, and the imperial pound. The

coinage must necessarily be the basis of any changes leading to the more extended

adoption of a decimal scale. Taking the pound sterling as the primary unit, they

propose to introduce a coin of the value of 2*. (one-tenth of the pound) ; another,

either silver or copper, of one-tenth of 2s. (or 2d. and a fraction), which might be

called a cent (the hundredth of a pound) and the thousandth part of the pound ster-

ling, or nearly the value of our farthing (of which there are 960 in the pound), which
new coin it was proposed to call a millet (or thousandth). The difference in the value

of the copper coinage was less important, as it was merely a representative coinage,

and had not an approximate intrinsic value like the gold and silver coinage. For the

proposed coin of 2s. various names had been suggested, as Fictorine, rupee, or florin

it being not much different from the value of some of the rupees of the East Indies, or

the florin of the continent. Under this new decimal scale the shilling would be re-

tained, and also the sixpence (but the latter under another name, more representative

of its value). For the half-crown would be substituted the 2s., or Fictorine. The

very rev. gentleman dwelt at some length on the advantages of this change "in the ex-

tensive money transactions and accounts of bankers and merchants; in the Bank of

England, for instance, where a thousand clerks were employed, it would greatly facili-

tate the operations of calculations and book-keeping. Thus, discarding millets (for
bankers now excluded the subdivisions of a penny in their accounts), the sum of 17/.

3 Victorines, 7 cents, would be represented at once by 17'37 ; only two places of de-

cimals, instead of as now in pounds, shillings, and pence. He showed how the prin-

ciple was applicable, with still greater advantage, in cases of weights and measures

(where the scale was now most anomalous and absurd). Suppose the rental or value of

JJO'Gl acres of land to be required, and that the land cost 69/. 3 Fictorines, 4 cents an

acre. The reduction in common arithmetic was one of very considerable labour,

difficulty, and time. But by this plan the result might be obtained in five lines of

decimals, containing only twenty-one figures. As to weights, the most extensive

change recommended by the committee would be to introduce the uniform weight of

lOlbs. to the stone, instead of the varietiesof 81bs. in some, and 14lbs. or 16lbs. in other

parts  of  the  kingdom                                            the hundred weight to  be  called  centner (a  German term).
                                                                ;

These were all the changes proposed in weights the commission not wishing to in-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

terfere with the subdivision of the pound, which admitted of four subdivisions into

8 oz., 4 oz., 2 oz., and 1 oz. The pound and ounce would remain, therefore, exactly the

same as at present. As to the measure of length, the commission thought it too vio-

lent a change to alter all the milestones ; but there would be no difficulty (with re-

ference to the standing orders of Parliament in railway matters, &c.) in introducing
the measure of 1000 yards, which might be called a milyard. However, the commis-
sion made no recommendations as to nomenclature, leaving that to the legislature.
Thus the changes proposed to be introduced, not only to ensure a decimal coinage,
but a decimal subdivision of weights and measures, were by no means of that formi-

dable and appalling character which many persons suppose they must of necessity

                                                      cal Instrument.

   The importance of multiplying stations at which simultaneous meteorological obser-
vations may be made does not require any discussion. The chief obstacle to their
establishment is the necessity for the constant attendance of an observer to register
the indications of the instruments, which difficulty is greatly increased when the ob-
servations are required to be made by night as well as by day. All attempts to make
self-recording thermometers, barometers, &c. by mechanical means have hitherto
failed, because the mechanical force exerted by the rise of the mercury in the tubes is
insufficient to overcome the frictions of the attached mechanism, and only very inac-

curate indications can be obtained. The principle, however, which I employ in my

meteorological telegraph, viz. the determination (by means of a feeble electric current)
of any required mechanical force by the mere contact of the mercury in the tube with
a fine platina wire, enables all these difficulties to be overcome, and a Meteorological
Recorder may now be made, which shall register every half hour the varying indi-
cations of the barometer, thermometer and psychrometer, as accurately as the most
careful observer would be able to do, and which will require only a few minutes at-
tention each day to put it in proper order to act for twenty-four hours. I propose
therefore that such an instrument, the cost of which I estimate will not exceed 50/.,

shall be constructed, under my direction, for the Richmond Observatory. If, after a

few months' trial at the Observatory, it shall be found to succeed, as I confidently ex-
pect it will, a great impediment to the advancement of meteorological science will be

removed. Persons in almost every locality may be found who would not object to de-
vote a few minutes per day to prepare such an instrument for use, but who would
find it impossible to give the requisite attention to make hourly or half-hourly obser-
vations themselves ; and the cost of the apparatus (which may hereafter probably be

considerably reduced) is, considering the important objects in view, too inconsiderable

to stand in the way of its general adoption.

                           Time. By Follet Osler.

   Mr. Osier's idea was, to have a pendulum, which should make, say ten swings in
the time that the principal pendulum made eleven, furnished with a small dial, and so
placed as that the coincidences, or want of coincidence, could be observed. The strokes
of such a pendulum being counted, the time of every observed stroke of it, reckoned
back from its coincidence with the principal, or seconds pendulum, would, it is ob-
vious, be found in tenths of a second.

    On the Rate of a Patent Compensating Pendulum. By E. J. Dent.

   The invention consisted in giving impulse to the pendulum at the centre of percus-
sion instead of the usual place, which is near to the centre of suspension. Mr. Dent

stated the performance of clocks thus made to be very satisfactory. He mentioned, in
connection with this subject, the invention of a new escapement by the Astronomer

Royal, which had been found of advantage in preventing the stopping of clocks at low
temperatures.

      On a New Chronometer Compensating Balance. By E. J. Dent.

   The ordinary compensation balance is constructed of two segments of a circle, of
brass and steel, and from the circular form of these pieces, the compensation weights
attached to them are moved out too far from the centre of motion in cold, and not
sufficiently in toward the centre in warm weather. Hence chronometers thus con-
structed gain on their rates at the mean temperature, and lose at both extremes.

   Mr. Dent stated, from experiment, that the compensation weights were carried over
nearly equal spaces for equal increments and decrements of heat, whereas the mathe-
matical rule requires that they should be carried over spaces proportioned to the
square of the distance from the centre of motion.

   Mr. Dent's invention of a new compensation balance consisted in the compensation
pieces being made into such curves as would practically meet the case required. The
experimental investigations on which this construction was founded, were described at

length.

              On Decimal Fractions. By Anthony Peacock.

   If the successive remainders in finding the reciprocal of a prime number be placed
over each quotient figure, the whole will form a table of the decimals equivalent to such
number as a denominator, and the respective remainders as numerators. By this ar-
rangement the several properties of pure repetends may be studied with great advantage.

2ndly. If the last index of a reciprocal repetend from a denominator ending in 9 be

made a multiplier, and multiplication be made from the last figure, the unit figures of

the successive products will be the left-hand following digit of the series. In 29ths the

last index is 3, and as the several products are placed over the series, this curious pro-

perty may be seen to advantage.

   As this property belongs to all repetends formed from denominators ending in 9, by
a knowledge of the last index, and the last figure in the series, any repetend may be

very easily calculated by multiplication, from the last figure of the series to the first;

while by a particular arrangement of the process, no multiplier need be above 9.

The last index may be distinguished as the circulate multiplier, and is always one

more than the tens in any number ending in 9 ; the circulate multiplier for 19 is there-

fore 2                              for 49 it is 5 ;  and for 199 it is 20.
                                 ;

Since every prime number terminates in either 1, 3, 7, 9, and the products of 1, 3, 7

by 9, 3, 7 respectively terminate in 9, the circulate multipliers for numbers ending in

1,3, 7 will be the circulate multipliers of such products ending in 9 ; for example,

X =7 7 49 gives 5 for the circulate multiplier for 7ths.

   The last figure of the series, from denominators ending in 9, is always the unit figure

of the numerator.
   Having the circulate multiplier, and the last figure in the series, the repetend, as was

before observed, may be found by multiplying the circulate multiplier into the last figure,
then into the unit figure of the product, then into the unit of the next product, and so
on successively, until the whole of the series is produced from the end to the beginning.

 On the Dichroism of the Palladio-chlorides of Potassium and Ammonium.
                            By Sir David Brewster.

   Dr. Wollaston had found that a long crystal of either of these salts, when looked
through transversely, had a green colour, but when looked through from either end,
had a red colour; and he (Sir D. Brewster) placed one of these long crystals trans-
versely over another, in a cruciform shape, and then found that those portions of the
centres of both, which were in contact, gave a red colour, while all the ends of the

crystals were red.

On the existence of a New Neutral Point, and two Secondary Neutral Points.
                           By Sir David Brewster.

   After noticing the two neutral points (points where there is no polarization of light)

MM.of Arago and Babinet, Sir David Brewster said he had discovered a third.
He also mentioned amongst some general results of observations continued for a long

time, that instead of the point of maximum polarization being always, as supposed, at
90° from the sun, he had found it more frequently 88° from the sun. He also de-

scribed a polarimeter or polariscope, by which, he said, the rectilinear bands in polar-

ization were seen more clearly than by other methods.

On certain Cases of Elliptically Polarized Light. By Prof. Powell.

At the last meeting of the Association, Prof. Lloyd* gave a theoretical investigation

of certain results obtained by Sir D. Brewster relative to thin films from which polar-

ized light is reflected. Besides completely explaining those results, Prof. Lloyd infers,

that such films ought to give the portions of light reflected at their two surfaces differ-

ing in phase, and that the light should be consequently in general elliptically polarized.

   The author of the present paper, before he was aware of the investigation of Prof

--Lloyd, had made many observations on the elliptical polarization of light by reflexion

from metallie and other surfaces, the method of observation being by the well-known

dislocation of the polarized rings. Some of these experiments went merely to prove

the existence of elliptic polarization in cases where it had not previously been detect-

ed, as in certain minerals and other bodies in which it is seen though of small amount.

In other cases the reflecting surface consisted of the thin films formed on polished

metal by tarnish, by heat, or by the galvanic process of Nobili. In these instances, a

verification was afforded of Prof. Lloyd's theory by direct observation. But, further,

these films give periodic colours and in passing from                                                                                                                      one  tint  to  another, the  ellip-
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

ticity, as disclosed by the form of the rings, underwent regular changes, passing from

a dislocation in one direction to the opposite, through points of no dislocation or of

plane polarization, the rings being alternately dark and bright centred. This afford-

ed a further field for the application of theory, and Mr. Airy investigated a formula

for the rings under these varying conditions, with which the phenomena are in perfect

accordance.

             On Crystalline Reflexion. By Sir David Brewster.

myHaving (said Sir David), in a conversation with Prof. Kelland, had                                                                                                                      attention

directed to Prof. M'Cullagh's interesting memoir on the laws of crystalline reflexion

and refraction, I have felt it necessary to make a communication on the subject to

the British Association. In consequence of the results which I laid before the Bristol

meeting, Prof. M'Cullagh was led to revise the views to which he had been led by my

earlier experiments in 1819. I had at that time the advantage of communicating with

him personally and by letter ; and, having preserved copious abstracts of his paper on

-- mythe subject, I did not look into the memoir itself till yesterday, when                                                                                                              attention

was drawn to the following note : " I was at this time in doubt whether the phe-

nomena observed with oil of cassia could be reconciled to that theory ; and when the

note in page 36 was written, I was almost certain that they could not. But I have

since, I think, found out the cause of this perplexity : some of Sir David Brewster's

experiments were made with natural surfaces of Iceland spar ; others with surfaces

             * See Report, 1841. Transactions of the Sections, p. 26.
--14 REPORT 1842.

artificially polished. I believe (though I have made very few calculations relative
to the point), that the former class of experiments will be perfectly explained by the
theory; the latter I am certain cannot, nor ought ice to expect that they should; for
the process of artificially polishing must necessarily occasion small irregularities by
exposing little elementary rhombs with their faces inclined to the general surface,
and the action of these faces may produce the unsymmetrical effects which Sir David
Brewster notices as so extraordinary. If this does not account for such effects, I do
not know what will." Had Prof. M'Cullagh communicated to me this explanation of
the incapacity of the undulatory theory to account for the extraordinary unsymme-
trical phenomena which I described to the British Association, and which exist to a
much greater extent than I described ; or had it been contained in the two abstracts
of his memoir, with which I was familiar, I could at once have removed the difficulty
referred to in the preceding note. The view he has taken of the action of an arti-
ficially polished surface of Iceland spar, is a mistaken one. The exposure of ele-
mentary rhombs with faces oblique to the general surface, would show themselves in

separate rays inclined to the principal pencil, especially in solar light. It could not for
an instant be overlooked by an experienced observer. Such faces I can produce at
pleasure, by a slight chemical action upon the surface, whether polished by crystal-
lization or by art ; and it is impossible to confound the pencil which they reflect, with
that which is given by the general surface. It is useless, however, to pursue this ar-

gument any further, because I have obtained exactly the same results in using natural
faces, and in using artificial ones, and especially on planes perpendicular to the axis
of the crystal, where I have found the same results with the natural faces of the Chaux
carbonatee basee of Hauy, and with those produced by artificial grinding. In this case
the coincidence is still more remarkable, as the very friction of the finger is capable
of developing on this surface the faces of elementary rhombs ; but the reflexions from
these never disturb in the slightest degree the physical action of the general surface.
I have no doubt that Prof. M'Cullagh will concur in the accuracy of these views, and,
with that candour which distinguishes him, will acknowledge, as he has almost done
already in the preceding note, that the undulatory theory is, generally speaking, in-
capable of explaining the phaenomena of crystalline reflexion.

On a very curious fact connected with Photography, discovered by M. Moser
    of Kbnigsberg, communicated by Prof. Bessel to Sir D. Brewster.

Sir D. Brewster said, he was requested to communicate an account of some remark-

Aable facts connected with the theory of photography.  new process of producing

photographic impressions had been discovered by Dr. Mbser of Kbnigsberg ; and an

account of the discovery had been brought to this country by Prof. Bessel, who re-

ceived it from the discoverer himself. The subject was most important, and it would

have been a great misfortune if the Physical Section had separated without being
made acquainted with it. The following were the general facts connected with it :--

A black plate of horn, or agate, is placed below a polished surface of silver, at the

distance of one-twentieth of an inch, and remains there for ten minutes. The surface

of the silver receives an impression of the figure, writing, or crest, which may be cut

upon the agate or horn. The figures &c. do not appear on the silver at the expiration

of the ten minutes, but are rendered visible by exposing the silver plate to vapour,

either of amber, water, mercury, or any other fluid. He (Sir D. Brewster) had heard

Prof. Bessel say, that the vapours of different fluids were analogous to the different

coloured rays "of the spectrum ; that the different fluids had different effects, cor-

responding to those of the spectrum ; and that they could, in consequence of such cor-

respondence, produce a red, blue, or violet colour. The image of the camera obscura

--might be projected on any surface, glass, silver, or the smooth leather cover of a
book, without any previous preparation ; and the effects would be the same as those

produced on a silver plate covered with iodine.

On the Geometric Forms, and Laws of Illumination of the Spaces which
  Byreceive the Solar Rays, transmitted through Quadrangular Apertures.
   Sir David Brewster.

   He said his attention was called to this subject by an accidental discussion on the

point, whether or not Aristotle, in explaining the circularity of images formed by
quadrilateral apertures, employed the appropriate idea when he said that those images
were, to a certain extent, quadrilateral, but appeared circular, from the eye being unable
to recognise faint impressions of light. Prof. Whewell, in his ' History of the Philo-
sophy of the Inductive Sciences,' had distinctly stated, that Aristotle had not used the
appropriate idea, and that the question was entirely a geometrical one, the appropriate
idea being the rectilinear nature of light. Having been led accidentally to consider
the subject, he (Sir D. Brewster) had determined in a simple manner the form of the
aperture at all distances, and had been led to take the same view of the subject with
Aristotle, who seemed to have employed the appropriate idea.

On Luminous Lines in certain Flames corresponding to the defective Lines in
                   the Sun's Light. JBy Sir David Brewster.

  DAfter noticing Fraunhofer's beautiful discovery as to the phsenomena of the line

in the prismatic spectrum, Sir David said, he had received from the establishment of
that eminent man, at Munich, a splendidprism, made for the British Association, and
one of the largest, perhaps, ever made ; and, upon examining by it the spectrum of
deflagrating nitre, he was surprised to find the red ray, discovered by Mr. Fox Talbot,
accompanied by several other rays, and that this extreme red ray occupied the exact

Aplace of the line in Fraunhofer's spectrum, and equally surprised to see a luminous
line corresponding with the line B of Fraunhofer. In fact, all the black lines of Fraun-
Ahofer were depicted in the spectrum in brilliant red light. The lines and B turned

out in the spectrum of deflagrating nitre to be both double lines ; and, upon examining
a solar spectrum under favourable circumstances, he found bands corresponding to these

double lines. He had looked with great anxiety to see if there was anything analogous

in other flames, and it would appear that this was a property which belonged to almost

every flame.

On the Structure of a Part of the Solar Spectrum hitherto unexamined.

                        By Sir David Brewster.

He had, by means of the prism from Munich, been enabled to extend the solar

spectrum beyond the point where, according to Fraunhofer, it terminated immediately

at the side of the line A, and he (Sir David) found one part to consist of about sixteen

lines, placed so near to each other, that it was difficult to recognise the separation

but the lines, as they approached to A, were much nearer to each other than as they

receded from it ; consequently, that portion of the spectrum appeared concave, resem-

of structure of one part of the spectrum with that of another, it seemed to him, that,

by and by, something important would result ; for there was a repetition of a group

of lines, and similar lines, through different parts of the spectrum, as if the same cause

which produced them in one part produced them in another.

          On the Luminous Bands in the Spectra of various Flames.
                           By Sir David Brewster.

  He had endeavoured to procure all the minerals and artificial salts and other sub-

stances capable of combustion which could be had ; and, in order to have a suitable
combination, he used an oxygen light analogous to the Bude light. Every one con-
ducting these experiments was aware that it was necessary to pass the light through a
narrow aperture; but this would reduce the intensity of the light so much, as to make
it difficult to observe the rays at the extremity of the spectrum ; but he found that he
could obtain the effect of a small aperture, by merely inclining the prism ; so that, with
a good prism, the great lines ia the solar spectrum might be seen by using an aperture

three or four feet wide, the whole breadth of the window, by the mere inclination of

the prism, which had the effect of producing a narrowing, facing the light. He had

obtained  200  or  300 results,  which  He  had  not  had  any  leisure  to group                                        but he would

mention some of the general results. When nitrate of lead was thrown into combustion,

remarkably tine lines were produced in the spectrum. The luminous line, D, of Frau-n-

hofer, existed in almost every substance, especially in all into which soda entered, par-

ticularly in the flame of a common tallow candle; probably owing to the muriate of

soda existing in the tallow. The hydrate of strontites gave the lines very remarkably in

yellow and green. The iodide of mercury did the same. Also in that remarkable

substance, the lithoxanthemate of ammonia, first discovered and published by Mr. Fox

Talbot, the fine lines were seen throughout the whole length of the spectrum; and

there was a remarkable blue band, which he (Sir David Brewster) bad not distinctly

recognized in any other flame. Indigo gave fine green and orange lines at equal di-

stances from the D of Fraunhofer. Prussian blue did the same; calomel, nitrate of

magnesia, litharge, also showed lines; the sulpho-cyanite of potash gave a violet and

orange flame, with the lines extremely distinct. He hoped, at the next year's meeting

of the Association, to be able to embody these various results in a regular report.

     On the Improvement of the Telescope. By H. Fox Talbot, F.R.S.

    Mr. Fox Talbot said, that this subject occurred to him about two years ago, when
 the Earl of Rosse (then Lord Oxmantown) was making much larger specula for re-
flecting telescopes than had ever been obtained before ; and he thought, if once we
had a very large and perfect speculum, it might be possible to multiply copies of it by
galvanic means. He had observed, that if an electrotype cast were taken from a per-
fectly polished surface, the cast was also perfectly polished; so that no defect of form
from this cause could have an injurious effect on the speculum. The great and ob-
vious defect was, that electrotypes were in copper, which reflected but little light.

He mentioned these ideas to Prof. Wheatstone, to whom the same views had occurred

previously, as he showed Mr. Talbot a paper which he had drawn up some few
months before, in which he suggested the making specula of platina, palladium, silver
or nickel, by precipitating a sufficient thickness of these metals upon the mould to ob-
tain a perfect surface, and afterwards precipitating a less valuable metal, as copper, to
form the body of the new speculum.

    Though it had occurred to Mr. Talbot to precipitate white metals, yet he did not
think that platina would have a sufficiently beautiful white metallic polish. Prof.
Wheatstone had, however, made choice of platina; and, varying the quantity till he
found the required proportion, he obtained a mirror in platina, which appeared to him
(Mr. Talbot) to have quite brilliant polish enough, and to be white enough to answer
the purpose ; and he considered, therefore, that Prof. Wheatstone had proved, that, at
least in one form, the specula of telescopes might be made by voltaic precipitation.
His own idea was, that it might be possible to whiten the surface of the copper without
injuring the form ; and, therefore, having obtained a speculum in very bright, polished
copper, be (Mr. Talbot) whitened it, and transformed it into sulphurct of copper, by
exposing it for a minute to the vapour of hydrosulphuret of ammonia, which did not
injure its polish, but after passing through a series of varied colours (scarlet, blue,
&c.) rendered it very white; and after having retained this speculum about a year, he
did not perceive the smallest alteration in any respect. This, therefore, appeared to him
a mode bv which important results could be obtained. There was no danger of such
a speculum being oxidated by the air, since it was already in combination with sul-
phur, a more powerful chemical affinity than oxygen.

    For the last year, perhaps, nothing further had been done, either by Prof. Wheat-
stone or himself; but lately, being at Munich, he visited Prof. Steinheil, and saw his
inventions, and learned from him that he had discovered a method of making specula
by the electrotype. It so happened, that both Prof. Steinheil and himself had pub-
lished their respective methods about a month or six weeks before; the Professor
having read a communication on the subject before the Academy of Sciences at Mu-
nich, and printed it, and Mr. Talbot having published his in England. Their modes
were, however, different, as Prof. Steinheil precipitated gold upon the speculum which
was to be copied, and having precipitated a certain thickness of gold, he then precipi-

tated copper on the back of the gold, to give it sufficient thickness. He (Mr. Talbot)
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                  17

 should have thought beforehand that gold would not reflectlight enough to be available;
but Prof. Steinheil informed him he had found, by careful experiment, that it reflected

more light than polished steel. He allowed Mr. Talbot to look through a Gregorian
reflecting telescope, of which the speculum was a common one, but gilded, and he

found the image perfectly clear and well-defined, though a slight tinge of yellow was
thrown over all the objects. Prof. Steinheil said, that in the course of a year he should

have a very large telescope, furnished not only with a speculum, but also with other
apparatus, voltaically formed, so that telescopes might be made all from a good model,
so as to insure greater accuracy of proportions ; and in this way even very large tele-
scopes might be constructed- at a comparatively trifling expense. With reference to
precipitating copper on the back of the gold, the Professor had a simple expedient for

securing adhesion. He first precipitated gold from the cyanide of gold, and he mixed

with it cyanide of copper, and kept gradually increasing the quantity of the latter,
so that an alloy was precipitated, which was continually increasing the copper with
respect to the gold, till he had a speculum whose surface was gold, and which then be-
came an alloy, the quality decreasing, till, at the bottom,it became pure copper. This
was important; because, without such experiments, one would not have known that
such results would have followed; for some philosophers supposed, that, if we attempt

to precipitate the salts of two metals, only one is precipitated ; but Prof. Steinheil

informed him that they precipitated in union. He thus obtained a speculum with a

face of gold and a back of copper.
    But, supposing the largest, cheapest, and best speculum was obtained, the framework

of the telescope would be so gigantic, that few observers would be able to use the in-
strument. With a focal length of sixty to eighty feet, it would be quite unmanageable
for any private individual. The idea occurred to him (Mr. Talbot), to have a tube

fixed in an invariable position, and to have a perfectly true plane mirror, of a size
somewhat larger than the concave speculum, placed in front of the tube, with an aper-
ture in the centre. This plane reflector should be moveable about its centre in any
direction ; so that rays from luminous bodies, falling first upon the plane reflector, were
then reflected against the concave reflector, and then passed through the aperture. The
only motion requisite for the plane mirror would be one about its centre. The me-
chanical difficulties in the way of this plan would be far less than in the common method.

Prof. Steinheil's idea on this point was somewhat different. He (Mr. Talbot) had

thought of placing the tube in a horizontal position, which, in the case of a tube of

very great length, has manifest advantages. Prof. Steinheil's idea was, that it should

be pointed directly to the pole of the heavens.

       On the Theory of Magnetism. By John Goodman.

Having frequently attempted in vain to produce electro-magnetic effects by the

current from the electrical machine and metallic conductors, the author at length

resolved upon employing such imperfect conductors of the current as would arrest

the speed of the frictional fluid, and cause it to progress more in the manner of vol-

taic electricity. For this purpose he used a slip of common writing-paper as a con-

ductor in place of copper wire employed in electro-magnetism, and instead of the

soft iron substituted a plate of thin window-glass. This plate being arranged upon

insulating pillars, it was found, after several test experiments, that the greatest

weight that could be sustained was supported by suspending the same to a card or

paper armature affixed to the under surface of the glass, whilst a continuous current

from the positive to the negative conductor of the machine was transmitted along

the upper surface of the plate by means of two half sheets of writing-paper. In
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          _

this manner a weight of five ounces and twenty grains was sustained for some time,

which, in proportion to the quantity of electricity in the current, is probably as great

as is ever supported by any electro-magnet whatever.

From the success of this experiment the author contended, that for anything at

present known this may be the principle of magnetic action ; nor does he see any

reason for seeking other explanation of magnetic phsenomena than the simple laws

of ordinary electric attraction and repulsion. He also suggested that the crystalline

nature of iron may render it more capable of polarization by electric influence than

the other metals ; and if a polar effect be obtained, so that the electricity of one par-

tide shall pass on to the next in the series, and so on throughout the length of the
bar, and shall not be enabled to return without the removal of the inducing force,
the elementary particles of such bar will be placed in a condition for exalting the
tension of each other from end to end (as is the case in the multiplication of pairs

of plates in a voltaic battery), and produce what may be termed " reciprocal polari-

zation."

   The particles of steel may be so separated by the carbon which it contains, and by

the process of hardening, as entirely to prevent the return of the fluid after polari-
zation has been effected ; and finally, if the force of each particle be doubled by the
reciprocal polarization of the one next in line, and this by the next, and so on

throughout the series, it may readily be conceived that a degree of tension would be

produced at each end of a bar magnet, which would be capable of inducing in a
piece of metal of a similar kind, the same condition at a considerable distance, and
develope indeed all the phamomena exhibited by this wonderful agency.

   On the Cause of Dissimilarity of the Voltaic and Ordinary Electricities.
                               By John Goodman.

    There had arisen on the part of Dr. Faraday and other eminent electricians, ob-
jections to the use of the guarded poles in decomposing water, described by Dr.
Wollaston as being unidentical with voltaic decomposition, but the poles made use
of in an apparatus constructed by Mr. Goodman were of fine platina wire completely
unguarded. Poles of this description, one-eighth or one-sixteenth of an inch in length,
had been frequently employed by the author, and had readily decomposed water by
the current alone from the electrical machine.

    Mr. Goodman then proceeded to point out his view of the cause of dissimilarity in
the two fluids, and in so doing adverted to the phenomena exhibited in the employ-
ment of the condensing electrometer.

   On electrolvzing the plate in communication with the gold leaves, the latter in-

stantly diverge, and exhibit considerable " tension." But on drawing near the
 opposing uninsulated plate, a gradual collapse of the leaves is uniformly the result,
approaching each other as the plate advances, and when it has arrived at a given
 distance, the leaves are found in perfect opposition. But on removing the same they
again diverge, and this process may be repeated many times under favorable circum-
stances. During the period when the leaves are apart, the electricity by which the
 electrometer is charged is found to possess much " tension," that is (according to
 the views of the author), powerful attractive and repulsive properties, and in conse-
 quence much elasticity of character, great mechanical force, momentum, and capa-
bility of resisting atmospheric pressure, and considerable magnitude of spark, &c.&c;
but when the plates are in a given degree of apposition, all these properties disappear,
 and are supplanted by others more resembling the character of the voltaic than ordi-
 nary electricity. Its high tension is subdued, and the increased capacity of the plate
 for a further supply of electricity of the same kind, evinces the disposition of the
 fluijl to become more and more condensed, and assume that condition which may
with great propriety be termed " intensity." Hence we may infer, as stated by Dr.
 Faraday, what " an enormous quantity of electricity is present in matter," the
 atomic particles of the same being at all times subject to the polarizing influence of
 each other, at atomic distances, and inducing thus an amazing capacity for, and con-
 densation of fluid. It is not improbable that electricity in this condensed condition
 occupies the interior of metallic bodies, that it is indeed the peculiar fluid of the
 atomic particles of matter, and yet that of high tension resides on the mere surface of
 metallic conductors. The cause then of dissimilarity in the two modifications is,
 that in the one case (the voltaic) the elementary particles of all the matter, fluid and i
 solid concerned in its production, are continually in contiguous relation to each other;
 and in the other modification (the frictional) the two main antagonist or opposing
forces are removed and separated by the revolutions of the cylinder to a considerable
 distance from each other. The positive fluid upon the surface of the cylinder is re-
 moved completely out of the sphere of action of its opposing negative force, situate
 in the rubber, and is afterwards subject only to polarizing influence from remote
 bodies. Mr. Goodman exemplified this view of the subject by diagrams and fur-

 ther explanations.

On Improved Magnets, and the different Modes of determining their Powers,
   with an Account of certain undescribed Phcenomena in Permanent Mag-
  netics. By the Rev. W. Scoresby, D.D.' F.R.S., §c.

   The author having called attention to the varying relations of capacity for, and
retention of, the magnetic condition in specimens of steel of different mass, hardness,
and quality, showed by experiments with compound magnets, constructed by himself
after an extended investigation of their relations, the possibility of communicating
and retaining very unusual magnetic energy in systems of bars, suited for various
practical purposes. A magnet exhibited was stated to be of nearly ten times the power
of one on the ordinary principle of equal mass. The phsenomena exhibited by it
were, indeed, very striking, particularly its capability of suspending above 10,000
small nails in a loop which could be moulded like plastic clay.

   In respect to the different methods of determining the powers of straight bar mag-
nets, Dr. Scoresby showed the superiority in convenience and comparability, of the
method of deviations, over that of torsion, and mentioned as a general result, that
small bars exhibited greater proportionate magnetic energy than large bars.

    It appeared to have escaped notice that a considerable proportion of the energy of
magnets taken in combination existed in a state of elastic sitppression, so that, on se-
paration of the bars, a great increase of energy is exhibited in their individual powers.
This weakening of some bars placed in contact might even in some cases proceed so
far as to give to such bars an opposite magnetic condition whilst in the mass, and
thus really diminish the power of the combination.

   The result of his numerous experiments on the subject of the communication and
retention of magnetism, was to enable him to show what, for any specific purpose,
was the best quality and denomination (as blister-steel, cast-steel, &c.) of steel, and
the right degree of hardness. For certain researches concerning the earth's mag-
netism, Dr. Scoresby proposed powerful short compound bars (six inches or less in
length), of sufficient mass to carry reflecting mirrors for determining minute changes

of direction.

Supplementary Report of a Committee on Waves. By J. S. Russell, M.A.

Much of the difficulty experienced in attaining clear conceptions of the phrenomena

and mechanism of waves is to be attributed to this circumstance, that we are apt to
confound with each other, under the general name of Wave Motion, a variety of phre-

nomena essentially different in their origin, their form and their laws. This essential

diversity the author of this paper had formerly endeavoured to establish, more espe-

cially in the case of that species of wave which he had called the Wave of Transla-

tion. In his memoir of observations made in 1 834-35, he had indicated the existence

and described some of the phenomena of two other classes of waves, as also in the

former printed Reports of the Association ; but he had lately embraced an opportu-
nity of extending his observations and maturing a classification, which he now sub-

mitted to the Section.

Of waves, there seem to be three great orders obeying very different laws :

--(1.) Wave of the First Order. The wave of translation is solitary, progressive,

depending chiefly on the depth of the fluid ; has two species, positive and negative.

 --(2.) Waves of the Second Order. The oscillatory waves are gregarious, the time

of oscillation depending on the amplitude of the wave ; of two species, progressive and

stationary.

(3.)  The    leaves of the  third order are  capillary  waves                       gregarious :  the  oscilla-
                                                                                 ;

tions of the superficial film of a fluid, under the influence of the capillary forces, ex-

tending to a very minute depth, short in duration ; of two species, free and constrained.

The last of these classes he had not before minutely examined, and to them he

wished to draw the attention of the Section, as amongst the phaanomena which we

most frequently see and have yet failed to examine. Although these waves were

noticed by the author in 1834 and figured in a memoir of his own, which drawing had

since been published by M. Poncelet in his ' Mecanique ' along with an announcement

that he had observed the same waves in running water, yet they had not hitherto

attracted notice, or been thoroughly examined by Mr Russell or any one else. He

believed them to be the minute waves or dents indicated by the theory of Poisson, he

had therefore thought it his duty to examine them.

The waves of the third order were observed by Mr. Scott Russell in the following

Amanner.  slender brass wire was. inserted vertically into a still fluid, and drawn in

that position slowly along its surface. When the velocity is one foot per second, the

surface of the water exhibits a group of waves of great beauty and regularity, extending

forwards before the exciting point and spreading on both sides of it in the form of a

con-focal group of hyperbolas ; the focal distance of each hyperbola and its asym-

ptotes being determined by the velocity of the motion. Although the exciting

point was of no more than T'F th of an inch in diameter, these waves extend over
several feet, and the diagrams exhibited the phasnomena as having great regularity

and beauty. Numerical results, showing the number of these waves in an inch of

--distance from the exciting point, were given, and are nearly as follows :

    These waves were examples of capillary waves not in free but constrained motion.

He had generated them in a different manner, so as to examine them in free motion

uninfluenced by the generating point, and found that the capillary waves when moving

freely have a constant velocity of 8^ inches per second; that their duration is short,
becoming insensible in about twelve seconds after describing a path not longer than
eight or nine feet : in the free state this breadth is very small at first, gradually in-
creases, and just before vanishing attains an amplitude of nearly an inch.

   The capillary waves are among the phaenomena we most frequently observe. It is
in generating them that a gentle breeze forming over the surface of a smooth lake
destroys the translucent and reflective power of the surface ; they are also to be ob-
served in all cases of primary and secondary wave motion when the superficial film is
by any cause compressed so as to produce corrugation ; and they always disappear in

about twelve seconds after the exciting cause is removed.

  The second order of waves had also been made the subject of careful observation. A
mode had been discovered of generating those waves in large groups, so that instead of

observing single waves the length of one could be deduced from the measured length of a
number, thus getting the advantage of repetition of the quantity observed. It had thus
been finally determined that these oscillating waves follow Newton's law, in so far that

the velocities of transmission are as the square roots of the amplitudes; but the abso-
lute velocity differs from that of Newton, so that instead of having the wave whose

= =period is a second of an amplitude 3-26, it is found to be 3-57. The velocities

determined are as follows :

   After detailing the advantages which the locality where these observations were
made (Bovisand, near Plymouth) possessed for such an object, such as complete ex-
posure to the waves of the Atlantic, a series of buoys at ascertained distances, well-
observed soundings, a tide gauge fixed at the pier, and elevated cliffs from which the

waves in series may be conveniently observed, the author described his methods of
observing, and presented in a tabular form the results of his observations made durin°-

                      India. By Colonel Sykes, F.R.S.

   In offering a further contribution in support of an almost established law in me-
teorology, a few prefatory observations may be useful. Towards the end of the last
century it was remarked, in a series of barometrical observations made at Calcutta,

that there was a periodicity in the daily rise and fall of the mercury ; the barometer
throughout the whole year being highest between 9 and 10 a.m., and lowest between

4 and 5 p.m., the semi-diurnal oscillation however varying from - 030 to "150 or even

·170. Humboldt determined the same fact in South America, not only at the level of

the sea, but on the elevated plateaux of the Andes, finding however that there appeared

-- --to be a gradual diminution of the oscillations between 9 10 a.m. and 4 5 r.M. in

2)roportion to the ascent or elevation above the level of the sea. These phenomena

led to hourly barometrical observations, and it was found that whereas during the

day there was a maximum pressure between 9 and 10 a.m. and a minimum pressure
between 4 and 5 p.m., so during the night there was a maximum pressure between
10 and 11 p.m. and a minimum pressure about 4 or 5 a.m.; thus establishing two

ascending and two descending waves or tides in the atmosphere during the twenty-

Myfour hours.  meteorological observations, carried on for several years in the

Deccan at 2000 feet above the sea, and published in the Philosophical Trans-
actions, were entirely confirmatory of those made by Humboldt ; there never having

occurred a single instance, whatever the season of the year, wet or dry, hot or cold,

-- --in which the barometer was not higher at 9 10 a.m. than at 4 5 p.m. The same
--facts were obtained from the Nilgherry mountains at 8000 feet above the sea by
--Colonel Sabine from the coast of Africa and from numerous other places within the

tropics. From the irregular movements of the barometer beyond the tropics, the phe-
nomena escaped observation for some time, but of late years numerous careful ob-

servations and a series of averages have eliminated the same facts which characterise

the tropics, the amount or range of the semidiurnal oscillation, however, gradually

diminishing from the equator towards a parallel not yet determined, in very high

latitudes (but which is beyond 70° N-.), where the hours of maximum and minimum
pressure are not the same as at the equator. Mr. Snow Harris's singularly uniform

successions of curves of average pressure of the barometer at Plymouth for several
years, show the same hours of maxima and minima that 1 found in the Deccan ; and
by a series of observations transmitted to Colonel Sabine from Finmarken, in latitude

70° N., the average height of the barometer is still found in that high latitude to be

greater at 9 a.m. than at 3 p.m., the mean annual temperature of the place of obser-

vation approximating to the freezing point.

  Although there is a perfect accordance in the hours of maximum and minimum

pressure within and without the tropics, there is not the same accordance in the ex-

tent or range of the semidiurnal oscillation of the barometer. In the tropics it is

considerable ; in high latitudes very small ; and from such observations as have been
made in intermediate latitudes, grounds are afforded for the belief, that the amount

of the semidiurnal oscillation gradually diminishes from the equator toward the

poles, and that the time of the occurrence of maxima and minima are reversed,

the exact latitude where this change takes place not being yet satisfactorily de-

termined.

   With these prefatory' observations I may state, that the meteorological observations
obligingly communicated to me by Dr. Blest of the Madras army, from a new locality

in the Western Ghats, are entirely confirmatory of those I made in the Deccan re-

specting the movements of the barometer.

   The following is the acceptable Meteorological Register from Dr. Blest of the
Madras Medical Service, which he prefaces by a quotation from an official Report

made by Dr. Baikie :

  --" Temperature. The temperature of Coorg is one of the most moderate and

equable in the world, the daily range in doors never exceeding 6° or 8°, often not
beyond 2°, and the thermometer seldom rising higher than 74°, nor sinking below

CO , in the open air. The range is a little higher during the dry season, the daily ex-
tremes being between 52° or 53°, and 68° or 70° ; the annual extremes are probably

52° and 82°. The want of a maximum and minimum thermometer prevents my even

--guessing at the mean annual temperature, but it cannot exceed 65° or 66°.
   " Pressure. The maximum of the barometer occurs during the dry season, the
highest noted being 26*220, and the lowest in July during the monsoon 25-912. The

greatest daily range observed was "076 ; the mean daily range (which is very regular)
·050. The diurnal maximum occurs at 10 a.m., the minimum at 5 p.m., with such re-
gularity that I have often detected an error in the supposed time by looking at the
barometer at these hours. The barometer appears to offer no indication whatever of

approaching changes of weather, and I have not been able to detect any influence of

--the lunar phases on it.

that of extreme moisture, closely approaching to saturation. During the dry season it
is occasionally very dry, and sometimes undergoes most remarkable difference to the

   The above, in reference to temperature, Dr. Blest observes, differs somewhat from

the result of his observations, owing to greater exposure of his instruments, which

were self-registering thermometers. According to Dr. Blest the following are the

On a Cycle of Eighteen Years in Atmospherical Phenomena. By Luke

            Howard, F.R.S. Accompanied by a Chart, Plate II.

   In a Cycle of eighteen years, from 1824 to 1841, the seasons are found, by
observation at the Friends School at Aclcworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to
go througli their extreme changes of wet and dry, of warmth and coldness ; returning
at the end to the same (or nearly the same) state again.

   The lower figure of the Chart presents on a scale the mean or average Temperature
of each year, adapted by a curve to a mean line, representing the climatic (or eighteen
years) average of the heat of the district. The yearly averages differ to the extent in

--the whole of 4J degrees of Fahrenheit; the spaces by which they exceed the climatic

mean are coloured Red those by which they fall below it, Blue. It will be seen at
once that, in point of warmth, the years run through a cycle, the warm side of which

lies to the left, and the cold side to the right, of the dividing line in the middle.
    Above are represented, in two columns, first the proportionate appearance (as in-

dicated by observations made once a day) of the four classes of winds through each
year; beginning at North (coloured blue) and proceeding to the point next the East;

thence (coloured yellow) to the point next South ; thence (coloured red) to that next
West; and thence (coloured green) to North again; the remainder (left blank) repre-
senting the number of days on which no decided wind blew. Secondly, or. the right,

from year to year) in which it fell in the different seasons ; the winter being placed
lowest, the autumn at top. All which becomes still more interesting, when we are able
to refer by recollection, or by any good register of the weather, to past seasons ; or

On the Meteorology of the Northern Atlantic, the South-west Monsoon of
             India, and places adjacent. By Thomas Hopkins.

   Mr. Hopkins argued that the common mode of accounting for the trade-winds and
other great currents of the atmosphere was not correct. The general theory, he said, was

that the action of the sun's rays on the earth at the tropics raised the temperature of the
atmosphere ; and that, as the air thus heated became specifically lighter, it naturally

ascended ; and, the cold air rushing in to supply its place, a current was produced. He
did not mean to deny that such results took place, but he affirmed that the theory in
question did not account for the various meteorological phenomena which have been
observed, and that there was another cause which accounted for them in a much more
satisfactory manner. He then proceeded to show, that the condensation of the air by

great mountains, and the consequent precipitation of rain, must not be left out of ac-
count in explaining- the monsoons and other periodic winds.

LawOn the Application of the  of Definite Proportions to the Stratification

of Clouds. By James Nasmyth.

   Mr. Nasmyth was first led to speculate on this subject by observing the arrange-
ment of clouds in fine weather, when, towards the horizon particularly, they may be seen
extended in parallel bands or stripes. He conceived that the excess of vapour floating
in the atmosphere beyond what the air could combine with, formed clouds ; and that

the air, in each electric state, was capable of sustaining a definite proportion of vapour,
and consequently that the clouds of one class or description floated (in what might be

called a plane of equal electricity) at a uniform distance from the earth.

   On the Changes in the Climate of England. By Henry Fairbairn.

   The author proposes to prove that the low temperature of the summers of Europe
is caused by the unusual presence of ice in the Atlantic Ocean. This he states to
have been the fact during the four last cold summers, and adds, that the intelligence
brought on the subject by steam-ships justified the expectation of the summer of 1842
in Europe being also chilled from the same cause in the Atlantic. About half a century
since icebergs were a plnenomenon in the Atlantic not visible until the autumn ; now
they increase annually in numbers, and appear as early as the month of March.

   Interposed between Great Britain and America, and drifted eastward by the Gulf-
stream on the line of the north-west winds which prevail in summer, these moun-
tains of ice cool the air which blows from the west at that season, while the easterly

winds are warm.
   The augmentation of ice in the Atlantic is referred by the author to the increase of

warmth on the North American Continent, consequent on the cutting down of the
forests and the extension of civilization. By this means the ice is detached from the
circumpolar bays and rivers at an earlier period, and floats further south before being

melted than heretofore.

of the British Association, from M. Lenz, containing two Essays, one ' On the Resist-
ance of the Human Body to Galvanic Currents,' the other ' On the Theory of Magneto-

           On a new Optical Instrument. By Sir John Robison.

   Sir John Robison informed the Section that he had lately ascertained, by trial,
that on a solid rod of glass being plunged into such a cavity as that of the external
car, the light reflected inwards, along the interior of the cylinder, illuminates the
bottom of the cavity so as to render it distinctly visible through the matter of the
glass, provided it be homogeneous, and the ends of the rod be properly figured and
polished. He suggested that instruments on this principle should be made for the
examination of such cavities.

To the Secretaries of the Twelfth Meeting of the Association.

   I offer my warmest and most sincere thanks to you, illustrious and honoured Sirs,
for the honour of the invitation which you had the complaisance to send me in the

obliging letter of the 13th April, 1842, to attend the Twelfth Meeting of the British

Association for the Advancement of Science. I am very sorry to be unable to be
present. In order to respond in some measure, and as much as is in my power, to
an honour so conferred on me, I have desired my brother, who is at Turin, to send
to the Meeting a copy of my Memoirs, published in Modena since 1836, and I have
made an Abstract of my Sixth Memoir (not yet published) upon the Magnetizing

Action of Transitory Electric Currents, which I take the liberty of sending you here-
with. I trust that these productions may not seem unworthy to merit the attention

of the meeting. I confide in your kindness and in that of your learned countrymen,

and I hope you will receive my communication as a proof of my good wishes, and

as a humble testimony of gratitude and of the high esteem I entertain towards the

British Association.

I beg you to accept the sentiments of lively gratitude and profound esteem and

consideration with which I am proud to subscribe myself, Gentlemen,

                      Your most obedient servant,  Stefano Marianini.

Modena, 1st June, 1842.

Abstract of an unpublished Memoir upon the Magnetizing Action of Trans-
   itory Electric Currents, in which it is proposed to explain the Varia-
   tions in Magnetic Susceptibility which are frequently observed in Iron

   as often as it has been magnetized. (Addressed to the Twelfth Annital

  ByMeeting of the British Association for ilie Advanceme?it of Science.)

   Professor Stefano Marianini.

  A piece of iron magnetized to a certain degree, and afterwards deprived gra-

dually of its polarity by the circulation of electric currents round it, presents the phie-
lomenon, that, by a given current, it is magnetized more strongly or more feebly

 "lan it is in its natural state, according as the given current is so directed as to pro-
duce the north pole in the same part in which it had been produced from the begin-

ning, or is directed in the contrary way. This phenomenon furnished, three years

ago, the subject of my Second Memoir upon the Magnetizing Action of Transitory

Electric Currents. But I then limited myself to the study of the laws of the pha?-
nomenon itself, of which it may not be inopportune to transcribe some here, for the
better understanding of what follows :

    1st. If the magnetic susceptibility of a piece of iron be in one direction increased

(that is, so that it may have the north pole at a given extremity), and if it be
diminished in an opposite direction, the susceptibility may be inverted by treating the

same iron with currents or other magnetizing actions contrary to those first employed.
   2ndly. The increase of magnetic susceptibility in one direction equals the decrease

of magnetic susceptibility in an opposite direction.
   3rdly. If the action of a given magnetizing current is repeated upon the same

iron, the alteration in the susceptibility goes on always diminishing.
   After having long studied the means of depriving the iron of magnetic polarity,

and especially the difference which occurs between the de-magnetizings produced by
operations which serve also to magnetize, and those produced by operations which
do not serve to produce magnetism in a sensible degree ; and after an equally long
study of the actions of the transitory currents upon magnetized iron, it seemed to

28               --report 1842.

me that I was able to explain this singular pheenomenon. The three following pro-

mypositions, inferred from the said studies, may suffice for  present purpose :

1st. When an electric current is made to circulate round an iron endowed with

magnetic polarity, a second is generated, which, together with that pre-existing, forms

a system of two polarities, more or less strong than the first, or even entirely

neuter, according to the force and the direction of the current employed.

2nd. The magnetic strengthening or weakening which is observed (when work-

ing as above mentioned), is proportionably less when the pre-existing polarity is

stronger.

  3rd. When magnetism is communicated to iron not magnetized, and not altered

in its magnetic susceptibility, and a transitory current is then caused to circulate
round it, a greater alteration is caused in the iron when it tends to magnetize it in
a contrary direction, that is, to produce the north pole in the extremity in which the

south pole is found.
   Let us endeavour to demonstrate these three propositions. The co-existence of

two conspiring polarities in one piece of iron I should not be able now to prove
but fortunately that is not necessary ; and to explain the phaenomenon of which we

treat, it suffices that the co-existence in a piece of iron of such polarities cannot be

doubted when they are contrary.
   That such co-existence of opposite polarities is possible, is proved by the known

fact, that two magnetic needles connected by poles of different name in contact, pre-

sent a whole sometimes without any polarity, although, after whatever time they
have been disunited they are both magnetized, as they were before they were con-
nected. Still the consecutive points which are sometimes observed in magnetized

needles, offer a proof that such magnetic systems may exist in the same iron. But

here it is necessary to prove their existence in iron wires, in which not only are no

consecutive points, but where there is no other trace of magnetism.
   To succeed in this separation, I set to work to study those operations which serve

to destroy magnetism, but not to generate it, at least in small masses of iron. Such
are heating, blows, shocks, friction, flexure, &c. Wires or cylinders of iron or steel,
from four to nine centimetres in length, and weighing from four or five grammes to
almost a hundred grammes, I have never succeeded in magnetizing by the said
means, especially if the irons had never been magnetized, or, had they been so, if
the magnetic state had been taken from them by heating, or by any other of the
said operations. Thus, as often as I destroyed by such means the magnetism pro-

duced in the iron by the electric currents, or by any other magnetizing agent, I never
saw any variation in the magnetic susceptibility. The propositions deduced from the
numerous experiments made upon the de-magnetizing action of the above-men-

tioned operations, cannot be inserted in this abstract. It may suffice to record the

following :
   If an iron deprived of magnetism, and whose susceptibility has not been altered,

be magnetized, and afterwards subjected to one of the said de-magnetizing opera-
tions, the portion of magnetism it will lose will be greater when the magnetization
communicated to it has been weak. The following is a proof :

  A large iron wire, eight centimetres in length, and weighing twenty-seven grammes,

was magnetized, so that the needle of the magnetometer deviated eight degrees*.
Being let fall upon a table from the height of two decimetres, it lost so much force
that the needle deviated but one degree. But having then magnetized it so that the
needle deviated to 25°, and afterwards subjected it to a shock equal to the preceding,

it yet did not lose the half of the magnetism which it had, since it caused the needle

to deviate 14°.

   * This apparatus consists of a needle, from the extremity of the cap of which rises
vertically a stick of brass, to which, by means of a running ring furnished with screws
in order to stop it at a convenient height, is attached a small horizontal rod, which carries
a tube of glass surrounded by a coil of copper wire covered with silk. The tube is parallel
to the magnetic needle, and its central point is in the perpendicular which passes through
the centre of the needle itself. The wire is so placed that its axis coincides with that of the
tube, and from the firm deviation of the under needle we may judge of the magnetic force
which the iron already possesses, or of that which is acquired by it in discharging the

Leyden jar upon the copper coil which surrounds it.
                   TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                            29

Let us then take a piece of iron, and after having magnetized it, by causing trans-

itory electric currents to circulate around it, let us treat it with contrary and weaker
currents than the preceding, until it no longer presents any polarity. If with the
said contrary currents I produced in the iron polarities which did not mutually de-
stroy, but only neutralized each other, what should happen if the iron were subjected
to some shock ? This act destroys a greater portion of the weak polarities than of

the strong, and therefore the iron after the shock will appear possessed of some de-

gree of magnetism, in the direction in which it had been more strongly magnetized.

And this is conformable to what the experiment shows.
  An iron cylinder, nine centimetres in length and weighing fifteen grammes, after

being magnetized so that the needle of the magnetometer deviated 60°, was deprived

of all polarity by means of several electric currents, so that the needle pointed to
zero. After this, having let the iron fall from the height of two metres upon the

pavement, it recovered such magnetic force that the needle deviated 16°.
   If, instead of acting with moderate or weak currents to neutralize entirely the po-

larity, some little is still permitted to remain, an iron is obtained, which has only

force to cause the needle to deviate 6 or 7 degrees ; but after the shock the needle de-

viated 16 or 17.

   And if the weak and contrary magnetizations are made use of until the iron causes

the needle to deviate 4 or 5 degrees in a contrary direction (that is, towards the east,

if it first deviated towards the west), then is the iron in such a state, that, by means

of the shock, it changes polarity, that is, presents the south pole at the extremity

which had the north, and vice versa.

These facts, which may be varied in many ways, prove, if I err not, that in a

piece of iron treated as I have mentioned, there exist systems of magnetic force,

which altogether or in part neutralize each other.

Let us proceed now to describe some experiments which show the truth of the other

two propositions.

An iron wire eight centimetres long, and weighing 118 decigrammes, was mag-

Anetized until the needle of the magnetometer deviated 12°.  small Leyden jar

(one square decimetre of coated surface), charged to the tension of 10° of the elec-

trometer on the double quadrant of Volta, was discharged upon the coil in which

was the iron, and so as to magnetize it in the same direction in which it was already,

and the effect was that the needle of the instrument went from 12° to 25°.

Having destroyed the magnetism of the said iron by means of shocks, and then

magnetized until the needle of the magnetometer remained at 59°, and having dis-

charged as above upon the coil the small jar charged to 10 degrees of tension, the

needle moved from 59° to 63°.

Whence it is seen, that the more the iron is magnetized the less a given current

can strengthen its magnetism.

I magnetized another iron equal to the preceding, so that it made the needle

deviate 9°, and after having discharged upon the coil which contained the iron the

jar charged to the usual tension, but so that it might tend to magnetize it oppo-

sitely, the needle passed from the degree 9°, which it marked on one part to the

1° on the opposite part.

Having magnetized the iron again so that the needle deviated to 20°, and having

afterwards discharged upon the coil the jar with its usual tension, and in a con-

trary direction, the needle moved from the 20° to the 10°.

Magnetism being also taken from the iron which then remained, then magnetized

so that the needle remained at 60°, and then having caused to circulate round it the

usual current excited by the small jar charged to 10° of tension, and so as to pro-

duce a contrary magnetism, the needle moved from 60° and stopped at 44°.

Thus, the more a piece of iron is magnetized, the less is its magnetism neutralized

by a contrary current.

Another piece of iron similar to the preceding being magnetized so that the

needle was fixed at 29°, and the jar with the usual tension being then discharged,

and so as to strengthen the magnetism already possessed by the iron, the needle

moved from 29° to 41°.

Having, by the usual mechanical operations, destroyed the magnetism of this iron,

then magnetized so that the needle was at 27°, upon the discharge of the jar with
--30 REPORT 1842.

the usual tension upon the coil, and so as to produce contrary magnetism, the

needle moved from 27° to 12°.

   Thus the said current acting so as to strengthen the magnetism of an iron which
caused the needle to deviate 10°, increased it so much that it deviated 21°. But that

magnetism being removed, and the same experiment being then repeated by causing

the current to act in an opposite direction, the deviation of 10° west was changed

to 3° east.

  A given current, therefore, and the same degree of another magnetizing action

has less effect when so directed as to strengthen, than when so as to neutralize the

magnetism.

Which things being established, it becomes easy to explain the variations in the

magnetic susceptibility of iron, of which we are here treating.

   Let us suppose an iron magnetized with some force, as, for example, that the
needle of the magnetometer may deviate 40°, and weaker currents being afterwards

made to circulate round it, let it be reduced to the point of no deviation. This iron

will be in such condition, that by a given current which circulates around it, it will be
more strongly magnetized, when this serves to make the south pole appear from the
same part at which it appeared when it was strongly magnetized, than when the

same current is made so to act that it tends to produce the south pole from the

part on which the lesser currents, which were made use of to neutralize the first

magnetization, tended to produce it.

   In fact, if with these discharges of the Leyden jar I have produced so many magnetic
systems, which now exist in the said iron, by causing to circulate around it a given cur-

rent, so directed as to tend to magnetize the iron, in the direction in which it had been
strongly, it is very true that it will but little strengthen the magnetic system having
the south pole towards the west, but it is true also that it will much neutralize the
weaker and opposite systems. Hence a polarity ought to be manifested in the said

direction, stronger than that which would be obtained with the same current before
the iron had been treated in the manner we have mentioned. Since things being

placed in the state of the preceding experiment, that is, the magnetism of the iron
being neutralized, if an equal transitory electric current is made to act so as to

produce in the iron the south pole on the opposite part, the neutralization of the

strong magnetic system should be 6mall, and equally small the strengthening in the

opposite magnetic systems, and thence the resulting magnetization will appear weak.

   I conclude this abstract with describing an experiment, in which, with a union
of iron wires differently magnetized, the phaenomena are imitated which the facts
above stated make us suppose to exist in an iron when its magnetic susceptibility is

changed.

I magnetized a bundle of six iron wires eight centimetres long, and weighing in

all thirty-seven decigrammes, deprived of magnetism, and not changed in magnetic
susceptibility, so that the needle of the magnetometer was caused to deviate 48° to-

wards the west. With five other iron wires, slightly magnetized and in different

degrees, united to the above bundle so that the north pole of the latter came in con-
tact with the south poles of the former, I made a bundle of eleven wires which did not
cause the needle to deviate. Having placed this bundle in the usual coil, and dis-

charged upon it the small Leyden jar with the tension of 10°, and so directed as to

produce the north pole in the said bundle, on the side where the six wires united to-

gether had it, such a magnetization ensued that the needle deviated 49°. And the

experiment being repeated from the beginning, and the jar with the same tension of

10° being then discharged upon the coil, but directed contrarywise, a magnetization

of only 22° ensued.                                 Stefano Mahianini.

employed. He found that when the negative platinum electrode is covered with a

thin film of an oxidised substance, water is decomposed by a current, which under
ordinary circumstances could not effect its electrolysis. From these experiments he
was led to seek for evidence of a polarised state of the electrolyte, and he came to
the conclusion, that the effects produced by oxidising and other substances in the
vicinity of the electrodes, are partly due to the chemical action which takes place be-
tween the ions of the electrolyte and the matters which surround the electrodes, or
the substance of which they are composed, and partly to a depolarization of the

electrodes effected by those substances.

   On the Electric Origin of the Heat of Combustion. By J. P. Joule.

   The author had endeavoured, in a former paper (vide Phil. Mag. vol. xx. p. 98),
to account for the heat evolved by combustion, on the hypothesis of its arising from
resistance to electric conduction, and had shown that the affinity of atoms for one
another is the measure of the heat evolved by their combination. In that paper he
had introduced his own experiments on the quantity of heat generated by combustion.
The simplicity of his apparatus had caused him to suspect that he had not collected
all the heat evolved ; but having lately reduced to English measure the results of
Dulong's experiments, which were executed in a manner very well adapted to pre-
vent loss of heat, he finds them to agree so nearly with his own results as to prove
that the method he used was not incapable of accuracy.

  On Apparatus for applying Circular Polarization to Chemical Inquiries.
                        By Prof. Powell, F.R.S., Sfc.

   The application of the phenomena of circular polarization as characterizing certain
liquid solutions, has been fully pointed out by M. Biot, and an apparatus has been
devised by him of the most perfect and accurate construction, for ascertaining and
measuring the effects in question. That apparatus is however complicated, expensive,
and very difficult to adjust, especially for those not familiar with optical experiments :
and where the object may be rather general indications than minute measures, it ap-
peared to the author susceptible of considerable simplification, which though unim-
portant to the more refined optical inquirer, might be valuable to the chemical student.

 --In general the essential parts of any such apparatus are, 1st, a polarizing plate ;

2ud, a tube containing the liquid under examination, so constructed that the polar-
ized ray can pass along its axis ; 3rd, an analyser of double-refracting crystal.

   In M. Biot's apparatus the supports, &c. are complex and difficult to adjust. The
tubes are of costly construction, each end being covered with plates of glass, so that
when filled with liquid, and the glasses screwed on tight, the original luminous

                                           image is seen distinctly through a great thickness of the
                                     liquid, bounded by truly plane parallel surfaces. To
                                       fulfil these conditions is a very troublesome process. The
                                        analyser also must consist of calc spar of the greatest
                                         purity, cut and adjusted with perfect accuracy to give
                                        two truly achromatized images considerably separated.

                                           The simplified form proposed by the author is as fol-

                                            lows :

                                        1st. Instead of the tubes with parallel glass ends, &c,
                                        he U6es merely common test tubes, having a hemispherical
                                      bottom and open at the top. The use of these is of
                                         course limited to the vertical position ; and the polarizing
                                  plate (P) of black glass must be fixed below at 35V to the

                                              axis of the vertical tube (T).
                                                 2ndly. It is consequently necessary to introduce a small

                                       silvered mirror (S) to throw the light upon (P) in the

                                              proper direction.
                                           3rdly. The tube must be enclosed in an opake case,

                                        and the light admitted at the bottom through a small

                                 hole. When the eye looks down it, the image of the lu-

                                         minous hole will be very irregular ; but,
                                             4thly. This evil is remedied by the remaining pecu-

                                        liarity in the analyser (A) ; which instead of the double
                                             refracting prism, consists simply of a double refracting
                                            crystal in its natural state, about three-fourths of an inch
                                         in thickness (R), on which the light falls through a hole
                                           (h), about one-twentiethof an inch in diameter ; the crystal
                                         is enclosed in a tube, in which slides another carrying a
                                        small lens (L), which at once magnifies the separation, and
                                        forms two distinct circular discs, however irregular the
                                        light, and in which all the optical changes are distinctly
                                         seen, either by the light of the clouds, or of a lamp, on
                                        making the analyser revolve about the axis, and measu-
                                          ring its rotation on a divided circular rim round it.

                                          The supports should be so contrived that the analyser
                                  may be adjusted to different heights, to allow of the in-
                                          sertion of tubes of different lengths from about six to

                                             eighteen or twenty-four inches.

ByOn some peculiar instances of (so-called) Catalytic Action.

                                   Mr. Mercer.

Mr. Mercer had long considered that instances of catalysis were merely examples

Aof chemical affinity exercised under peculiar circumstances.  body never entirely

yields up its chemical characters on uniting with other bodies. The iron in pro-

toxide of iron has still an affinity for more oxygen, and has not lost that affinity by
its first union with that element. The intensity of affinity, by which the simple ele-
ments are joined in the complex molecule, must be the measure of the stability of
the compound. Mr. Mercer argued, that when the elements of a body are in mere
static equilibrium, by virtue of a feeble attraction, and when it is acted upon by
another body possessing an affinity for one of its constituents, which constituent, on

the other hand, from peculiar circumstances, is not prone to combine with it, that

in such a case so-called catalysis must ensue. Thus, on mixing oxalic acid and

nitric acid with a little water, and raising the temperature to 130°, no action ensues.

But if a small portion of any protosalt of manganese be now added, the decom-

position immediately commences, and all the nitric is converted into nitrous acid,

--whilst the oxalic acid passes into carbonic acid. He thus accounts for this singular

action : The carbonic oxide of the oxalic acid possesses a disposition to unite with
oxygen. To gratify this disposition, it endeavours to withdraw it from nitric acid,

but is not sufficiently powerful to do so ; still it places the atoms of the nitric acid

in a state of tension. Another body (protoxide of manganese) now being introduced,
which also possesses an affinity for oxygen, exerts this affinity, and the combined
forces thus acting upon the nitric acid occasion its decomposition. The moment the
oxygen is withdrawn from its state of combination, it has two affinities to choose
between, and the attraction of the oxalic acid being greater, it passes over to it, con-
verting it into carbonic acid. The protoxide of manganese still remaining will act
on fresh portions ad infinitum. Most of the vegetable acids may be decomposed in a
similar manner. Following up this view, Mr. Mercer had discovered a number of
examples of what formerly would have been called catalysis. He showed, that
when alumina (precipitated from a hot solution) is placed in contact with dilute nitric
acid, no apparent action ensues. But as Dr. Playfair had described a peroxide of
aluminium, it ought to have a disposition to unite with oxygen. To discover then

whether the atoms of nitric acid were actually in a state of tension, he introduced a

slip of calico rendered blue by indigo. When this came in contact with the preci-

pitated alumina, the indigo was immediately discharged, although it remained un-
affected in the supernatant liquor. Chlorous acid was a body well fitted for his
purpose, as its elements were held together by a feeble affinity, and as its oxygen was

very readily yielded. He showed that the peroxide of copper, discovered by Dr. Play-

fair, occasioned a great evolution of oxygen from a solution of chloride of soda.
This was owing to its endeavour to become cupric acid, which under certain cir-

cumstances it did form. He had noticed many years since that a dark purple solu-

tion is obtained on mixing chloride of lime, a salt of copper, and lime with water,

and leaving the mixture at repose. No evolution of oxygen is occasioned by this

purple solution, but by the peroxide of copper before passing into it. Peroxides of
manganese and cobalt exert a similar action. The reason was, that these metals
possessed only a feeble affinity to pass into the metallic acids. Still the affinity was
sufficient to occasion the withdrawal of oxygen from chlorous acid. The moment it

was withdrawn elasticity came into play, and it escaped as a gas. A similar action
is exerted by the peroxides of iron and lead. From these and several other instances

which were described, Mr. Mercer concluded that almost all instances of catalytic

action may be reduced to feeble chemical affinity. He concluded by some specula-

tions on the atomic constitution of complex molecules.

On Hcematoxylin, the Colouring Principle of Logwood. By Professor
                         O. L. Erdmann of Leipsic.

   The hammtoxylin used by the author in his experiments, was prepared by the
process of Chevreul. In a state of purity hsematoxylin is not red ; it is in itself no

colouring matter, being merely a substance capable of producing colouring matters

in a manner similar to lecanorin, orcein, or phloridzin. The colours which it pro-

duces are formed by the simultaneous action of bases (particularly strong alkalies),

and the oxygen of the atmosphere. By the action of these it undergoes a process of

eremacausis, which, after forming colouring matters, ends in the production of a

brown substance resembling mould.

   The colour of hematoxylin varies from a pale reddish yellow to a pale honey
colour. The crystals are transparent, possess a strong lustre, and may be obtained

a few lines in length. Their form is a rectangular, four-sided prism, sometimes with

a pyramidal summit. The taste of hematoxylin is similar to that of liquorice ; it is

not' very soluble in cold water, but dissolves freely, with a yellow colour, in boiling

water. Its solutions are reddened by the action of ammonia and oxygen. Oxygen

alone is incapable of producing this effect, but the most minute trace of ammonia

imparts a purple colour to the solution. Hematoxylin forms, theiefore, the most

delicate test for ammonia, and is the easiest method of proving its presence in the

atmosphere. Hematoxylin is soluble in alcohol and ether. When exposed to the

influence of light it acquires a reddish tinge ; on being heated it is decomposed,

without giving any sublimate. It contains no nitrogen. When heated in the water-

bath it loses 16 "per cent, of water. The dry substance possesses the formula

C H 17 1S . There are two hydrates of hematoxylin. Acids do not act so ener-

getically on hematoxylin as bases. All the compounds of hematoxylin and bases

are decomposed by air and moisture.

The formation of the blue or red colouring matters which hematoxylin is capable

of producing, takes place in general by the mutual influence of bases and oxygen. If

an excess of ammonia or potash be added to a solution of hematoxylin, the liquid

becomes at first of a deep red colour, afterwards opake and of a dark red. After

the lapse of some time it loses its red colour altogether, becoming of a dirty brown

hue. When acetic acid is added to the solution, a voluminous brown precipitate is
obtained ; this body the author calls htematein. When the red solution is cautiously

evaporated, a substance of a dark violet colour is deposited ; this body is hamatem-

ammonia. Hematein is analogous to orcein, phloridzein, &c. ; it dissolves in water

with a purple colour ; by evaporating the solution, the whole of the ammonia is ex-

pelled, and pure hematein remains. Hematein differs from orcein in containing no

HCnitrogen : its formula is 4n ls 1B . Hematoxylin, therefore, in passing into

hematein, under the influence of ammonia, takes up three atoms of oxygen, two of

which combine with two of hydrogen to form water, and the third remains in the

Hematein may be combined with most metallic oxides. Hematein is decolorized

bv sulphuretted hydrogen, but this is not the effect of reduction, for the solution re-
gains its red colour when evaporated in vacuo. The author concurs. with Chevreul's

view, in supposing that sulphuretted hydrogen acts on reddened hematoxylin or

hematein in the same manner as a weak acid.

       On the Formation of Cyanuret of Potassium in a Blast Furnace.
                            By Dr. C. Bromeis of Cassel.

   M. Zincken discovered, at the bottom of the blast furnace at Magdesprung in the

Hartz Mountains, a mass which Dr. Bromeis found to contain ferrocyanuret of po-
tassium. The furnace from which it was obtained had been fed with charcoal. The
other ingredients of the saline mass were caustic potash, carbonate, silicate, and
manganate of potash, together with a large proportion of cyanate of potash and
cyanuret of potassium. It is probable that the ferrocyanuret of potassium did not
exist ready formed in the mass, but was produced after dissolving the cyanuret of
potassium in water. The cyanate of rfotash, by its decomposition, gives rise to car-
bonate of potash and ammonia. Dr. Bromeis supposes that the formation of cya-

--nogen must have been occasioned in the following mariner : The nitrogen of 'the

atmosphere being exposed to a great pressure and high temperature, combined directly
with the carbon of the carburet of potassium, producing thereby cyanogen and cya-
nuret of potassium. This explanation accords with the experiments of Defossc.

       On the Compounds of Carbon and Iron. By Dr. C. Bromeis.

exactly like an organic analysis, and is the method invented by Regnault. An im-

portant point in the determination of the carbon in iron is to ascertain the propor-

tion of carbon in a state of combination, in contradistinction to that ·which is
mechanically mixed with the metal. Dr. Bromeis effected this by dissolving the

mixture in muriatic acid ; the carbon in chemical combination unites with hydrogen

and forms carburetted hydrogen, while the carbon in mechanical mixture takes no
part in the action, but remains unaffected, and may be accurately determined. This

quantity, being subtracted from the whole carbon obtained by combustion, affords a

means of estimating the quantity in chemical combination.

Dr. Bromeis found in crystalline white cast iron, 3 '8 per cent,  of carbon                                         but as
                                                                                                                 ;

4%some white cast iron has been found to contain  or even 5"3 per cent., Dr. Bromeis

considers that manganese may be substituted for it ; he sometimes found as much

as 7 per cent, of this metal. It appears, therefore, that neither common nor white

cast iron are polycarburets of determinate constitution.

In white cast iron Dr. Bromeis found only 0"5 per cent, of mechanically combined

carbon, in other kinds nearly 1 per cent., and in gray cast iron 2'3 per cent. Hence

it follows that the chemically combined carbon amounts only to 0*9 per cent. Kars-

ten found 0'85 per cent.

Cast steel, according to Gay-Lussac and Wilson, contains - 93 per cent, carbon.

Bromeis found in hard cast steel, 0'97 per cent.

   Gray cast iron may be considered as a mixture of very impure cast steel with
carbon. This may possibly be the cause that it can be so easily hardened on the

surface.

On Kakodylic Acid and the Sulphurets of Kakodyl. By Prof. Bunsen

                                              of Marburg.

In the present paper Prof. Bunsen examines the higher stages of oxidation of

kakodyl, and the sulphurets corresponding to them. He finds that by the oxidation

of alkarsin, either by the direct action of the air or by means of oxide of mercury,

kakodylic acid is formed ; but there is also an intermediate oxide which cannot be

obtained in a state of purity, which seems to be similar to the hyponitric acid, and

to be a combination of kakodylic acid with the oxide. Kakodylic acid crystallizes

H HOout of alcohol ; its composition is C4

Aaether.  very remarkable fact with respect to this body is, that the poisonous pro-

perties of the arsenic seem totally annihilated ; eight grains administered to a rabbit

exerted no poisonous action.

Kakodyl combines directly with sulphur, forming the protosulphuret which has

been already described. This compound takes up another atom of sulphur, and

produces the bisulphuret. There appears also to be a tersulphuret analogous to

kakodylic acid. Prof. Bunsen has not, however, been able to obtain it in a pure

state. From the above results, it appears that kakodyl is precisely similar in its

behaviour to some simple metals ; and the formation of kakodylic acid by direct
oxidation is in exact opposition to the theory of substitution of M. Dumas.

  On some New Oxides of certain of the Metals of the Magnesian Family.
                            By Dr. Lyon Playfair.

   The author first drew attention to the defective state of our knowledge regarding
the oxides of the magnesian family. Iron and manganese possess sesquioxides, but

copper and zinc do not. Manganese has a high degree of oxidation represented by

the formula R 3 , but none of the other metals mentioned have an analogous oxide.

There is nothing in the molecular structure of the metals to account for this dif-
ference. It is indeed true that Thenard has described compounds of copper, zinc,

and calcium, to which he has ascribed the general formula of peroxide of manga-
nese. But these compounds do not possess any chemical characters in common
with that oxide. They are very unstable bodies, being decomposed spontaneously in
air, and more rapidly so by heat, by alkalies, and by acids ; they are formed by the
action of peroxide of hydrogen on .the protoxides of the metals. The author had

found that magnesian protoxides were very apt to form compounds with magnesian

R O +peroxides of the general formula          R» 4 . Hydrogen itself possesses all the

characters of a magnesian metal, and hence should share this aptitude. Thenard

found a deficiency of oxygen in the compounds obtained by him. This deficiency

would be accounted for on Dr. Play fair's view, that they consisted of peroxide of
MO +hydrogen with a metallic protoxide, of the formula
                                                        H, 4 , corresponding to

+R Othe compounds obtained by the author,      R2 4 . On this view, the proportion
Rof the radical to the oxygen would be 3 : 5, whilst on Thenard's formula of
                                                                                                                 2 , it

would be 3 : 6.

Dr. Playfair then described at length the manner in which he prepared the true

peroxides                                      chloride of soda was employed to effect their oxidation.  He had obtained
                                            ;

a peroxide of copper of a brown colour, which evolved oxygen when dissolved in

acids, and chlorine with muriatic acid. In its highest state of hydration it contained

2 atoms of water ; at 212°, 1% atom is expelled, thus showing that the correct for-

mula of the oxide is Cu 2 4 . The water is held with different degrees of force, and
compounds were described in which this water is replaced by oxide of copper. The

author also obtained a compound of this peroxide with a sesquioxide of copper,

+ +HO.corresponding to the mineral varvacite (Mn O
                                               Mn 2 4)                                                   The new body

+ + Hpossesses the analogous formula (Cu 2 3 Cu2 4)  O.

OThe author also obtained a peroxide of iron (Fe s) by similar treatment. It pos-

sesses analogous characters with peroxide of copper. Thus it contains 2 atoms of

water, half an atom of which is held with considerable force. This peroxide is sus-

ceptible of entering into combination with the sesquioxide of iron, and of forming a
compound corresponding to varvacite in chemical composition. The author had also

obtained a peroxide of aluminium of similar properties with the preceding peroxides,

but which differed in its relation to water. He concluded by announcing the dis-
covery of some new oxides of zinc and chromium, the examination of which were

not yet completed.

                                               Note on the Composition and Characters of Caryophyllin.

                                                                 By Dr. Lyon Playfair.

   Caryophyllin may best be prepared by digesting cloves with alcohol for several
days, in the manner described in Liebig's 'Organic Chemistry.' When pure, it is a

snow-white crystalline substance, insoluble in water, but easily soluble- in hot

alcohol. The addition of caustic ammonia or caustic potash to the alcoholic solu-

tion does not occasion decomposition or precipitation. Caryophyllin has been ana-

Hlysed by Dumas and Ettling, who found it to possess the formula Cio 16 2 . The

author of this paper found that, although this was the correct expression of the com-
position of melted caryophyllin, it was not so of that body in its natural state. He

found caryophyllin, kept for three days at 212°, to possess the empirical formula

H H + HC C40 33 5 , or the rational formula 40 32 4  O. This shows that the formula

given by Dumas and Ettling must be quadrupled. The anhydrous caryophyllin

would seem to show that it is isomeric with common camphor, but this hydrate

proves that it possesses twice its atomic weight, and brings it into the same category

of bodies with pinic, silvic, and copahuvic acids. Caryophyllin has always been sup-
posed to be an indifferent body, but the author showed that it is a weak acid, capable
of forming salts. Caryophyllite of potash (from which all the metallic salts may be
procured by double decomposition) is obtained by dissolving caryophyllin in an alco-

holic solution of potash, agitating the mixture with an excess of bicarbonate of
potash, evaporating the whole to dryness, and dissolving out the caryophyllite of
potash with anhydrous alcohol. The salts formed with metallic oxides and caryo-
phyllin are insoluble. Caryophyllite of potash is a white saponaceous body with a

crystalline appearance.

HThe oil of cloves possesses the formula C, s . By the absorption of one atom of
O = Hoxygen it would be converted into caryophyllin, C 10 Hs
                                                                                                         C The40 .
                                                                                                         32 4 .

simplest view would, therefore, be to suppose that caryophyllin is a product of the

oxidation of the indifferent oil of cloves, and not an educt of the cloves them-

selves.

              Contributions to the History of the Magnesian Limestones.

                               By Mr. Richardson.

   The author, considering the great importance of the magnesian limestones, both

to the manufacturer and agriculturist, conceived that an account of their composition

might prove acceptable. He examined the various limestones systematically, accord-

ing to the excellent arrangement of Prof. Sedgwick, and collected the results bf his

analyses in a tabular form. The insoluble residue of the specimens subjected to
analysis contained, in every case, organic matter. The analyses proved a very great
variation in the quantities of lime and magnesia. Mr. Richardson argued, that the
deposition of the lime and magnesia must have been effected simultaneously, from
the fact of layers of limestone existing above and below the magnesian limestones, in

which layers no magnesia can be detected. He was inclined to ascribe their depo-

sition to the influx of waters holding chloride of magnesium in solution, which,
meeting with calcareous matter held in solution by an excess of carbonic acid, robbed

it of that excess, and the two carbonates of lime and magnesia fell together.

On the Agricultural Importance of ascertaining the minute portions of matter

  derived from Organic Sources that may be preserved in the Surface Soil,

  Byand on the Chemical means by tohich its presence may be detected.

Dr. Daubeny.

The researches of Sprengel and Liebig, by showing the manner in which minute

quantities of certain ingredients may impart to the soil into which they enter as
constituents entirely new properties with reference to the purposes of agriculture,

have given additional interest to the methods of analysis, which aim at determining

the chemical composition of the surface, and of the substratum from which the

former principally derives its chief ingredients. The rude mechanical method adopted,

even by such chemists as Sir H. Davy, is no longer considered sufficient. The

nature, as well as the amount of the organic matter present, and the existence
_Lof phosphates, &c. in the proportion of ' , or even
                                                       th part of the en-

tire mass, are points deserving investigation, and afford a clue to the description
of manures most likely to be useful, and to the general treatment which the

land may require. It is also obvious, that the same importance attaches to a

knowledge of the constitution of the subsoil, since the advantages of exposing to
atmospheric influences, and thus disintegrating, the portions underneath, by deep

ploughing, and other methods of bringing the subsoil to the surface, will in a great

degree depend upon its containing ingredients which the crop requires for its sub-

sistence, and of which the superficial soil has been already in a great degree

exhausted. Thus, for example, it will often become a question with the farmer,

whether it be more economical to mix with the soil a given quantity of phosphate

of lime, or to incur the labour of so breaking up a portion of the subjacent rock, as

to unlock, as it were, for the use of the crop, that quantity which it contains in

close union with its other constituents. This inquiry, however, presupposes a
knowledge on his part of the existence of phosphate of lime in the soil, and of the

relative proportion it bears to the other ingredients ; data which can only be obtained

Athrough the assistance of refined chemical analysis.  few simple and easy calcu-

lations may show how very small a proportion of this ingredient might suffice during

a long period of time, for the demands even of those crops which require the largest

amount of it for their nutrition. Suppose the subsoil of a single acre of ground,
turned up to the depth of a foot, to weigh 1000 tons : now if this rock should be

found to contain only yoWth part of phosphate of lime, it will follow that no

less than a ton of this substance might be extracted from the uppermost foot of the

Nowsubjacent rock, by the action of the elements, or by chemical means.  one

ton of phosphate of lime would be adequate to supply 125 tons of wheat, or 680
tons of turnips. And if we reckon the average crop obtained from an acre of land
to be, of wheat, one ton, and of turnips, fifteen, it is evident that we have at hand
as much phosphate of lime as would be necessary for 125 crops of the former, or

forty-five crops of the latter. Dr. Daubeny said he had great reason to believe, that
many of our secondary rocks, those especially which contain organic remains, and

which appear in a great measure to be made up of shells, would be found, if ex-
38 REPORT-- 1842.

amined, to contain as large a quantity of phosphate of lime as that mentioned.
Though the soil of Great Britain be found deficient in the phosphates, there is reason

to believe the subsoil might in many cases be made, by proper management, to im-
part to it what was wanting. The discovery by Dr. Buckland, in the lias and

other secondary rocks, of the solid faxes of certain extinct animals, consisting of
phosphate of lime, induced Dr. Daubeny, some years since, to test a variety of
specimens of limestone, with a view of ascertaining whether traces might be found
in them of the same ingredient. The result was, that phosphate of lime in minute

quantities was much too commonly distributed to be attributed to coprolitic matter,
or to afford any independent evidence of its presence. When, indeed, we recollect

that the shells of invertebral animals contain from three to six per cent, of phosphate
of lime, and that, according to Mr. Connel, the scales of extinct fish, taken from
xocks as old as the coal formation, possess no less than fifty per cent, of the same
ingredient, it would be wonderful, indeed, if all traces of this substance had disap-
peared from rocks which appear often to be made up in a great degree of the debris'
of shells and other marine exuviae. Dr. Daubeny was, therefore, not surprised at

being informed by M. Schweitzer, who is intrusted with the management of the
German Spa at Brighton, that he had detected in the chalk of Brighton Downs,

as much as TWSE^1 part of phosphate of lime. From experiments since made
by Dr. Daubeny on the same rock, taken from various localities, he was inclined to
believe, that minute portions of this substance are present not uncommonly in that
formation. The frequent occurrence of phosphate of lime in calcareous rocks, and

the probability of its having been derived from the shells or bony matter of the living
beings contained in the calcareous rock, led Dr. Daubeny to suspect that traces also
of the organic matter which contributed to make up the animal structure, might

likewise be found accompanying it. He had accordingly availed himself in several

instances of the property which a solution of nitrate of silver possesses of becoming
black, by being brought into contact with organic matter on exposure to the light,
as a ready means of ascertaining the presence of organic matter in a specimen of
limestone ; and whilst by this test he determined its entire absence from Carrara
marble, chalk from the neighbourhood of a basaltic dyke on the coast of Antrim, and
even in many instances from petrifactions of shells contained in the secondary rocks,
he had obtained indications of the presence of some form of organized matter in se-
veral of the tertiary rocks, and even in the chalk.

   This test, however, cannot be successfully applied, except when bituminous matter
and every other form of mineral carbon are absent, and when the non-existence of
common salt has been previously established by the absence of any cloudiness upon
the addition of nitrate of silver after an exposure to light has taken place* ; nor
does this test enable us to determine whether the organic matter is of a vegetable or
an animal nature ; to ascertain the latter, a modification of Will and Varrentrapp's
process for estimating the amount of nitrogen in organic matter might probably be
adopted, the insoluble portion being heated with quicklime and caustic alkali in an
iron or platina tube, and the vapours being collected in a receiver containing muriatic

acid, or tested with turmeric paper.

    Dr. Daubeny read a letter from M. Schweitzer, who states that he had been pre-

 cluded from employing the secondary limestones in obtaining carbonic acid where-
with to impregnate his mineral waters, owing to an empyreumatical odour which the
gas carried up, and which he attributed to an organic cause. To obtain a perfectly
pure carbonic acid, for his imitation of the spas of the continent, he was compelled
to resort to the white kinds of marble. With regard to the presence of organic

matter in the subsoil, its detection may be a matter of some agricultural interest,
when we remember that the small quantities of nitrogen which are required for the
growth of those vegetables that first start up in a new country, could not have
been derived from an accumulation of mould by the decay of antecedent plants, but
must have arisen in a great measure from the animal matter, which is contained in
the rock upon which they grew, and which proceeds from the exuvije of races of
beings belonging to a former period of creation. In a more advanced stage of vege-
tation, this same material may be of some value to the crops that occupy the soil.

   * Common salt is present generally in chalk from the neighbourhood of the sea, and some-

 times even in sueciuieus from the iuterio;'.

Dr. Daubeny suggested whether the more compact texture of certain calcareous
rocks than of others, might not be connected with the existence in them of organic
matter, which, by its interposition, may prevent a crystalline arrangement of its par-
ticles from taking place. It may be, that the attraction between the particles of
matter, which, if uncontrolled, would prove too powerful for the agents of decompo-
sition to overcome, is weakened by the presence of organic matter, which thus enables
the rock to supply the vegetables that take root in it with the solid matter which
their structure requires. To the geologist, too, it cannot but be of interest to trace
the several steps by which the organic matters, which primarily must have constituted

so large a portion of the bulk of the various extinct animals and vegetables, have
disappeared from the strata which enveloped them.

On the Causes of the Irregularities of Surface which are observable in certain

 parts of the Magnesian Limestone Formations of this Country. By Dr.

  Daubeny.

The magnesian limestone rock in some of the quarries near Bolsover and Worksop

in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, present a remarkable appearance. They do

not possess an undulating surface, as limestones generally do, but the upper and

under faces are covered with irregular elevations and depressions of a very marked

character. In many instances the spicula or indentations run all in one uniform

direction, and those on the under side of the block are exactly opposite to those on

the upper. Prof. Sedgwick had cursorily noticed the configurations which these

magnesian limestones possess, and ascribes them to an arrangement'of the particles

of the rock which took place during the act of consolidation. Dr. Daubeny, however,

was inclined to call in the action of atmospheric influences, and that of water im-

pregnated with carbonic acid, as necessary to be resorted to in order to afford a full

explanation of the pheenomenon                                                                                                                                                appealing to  the fact, that the exposed surfaces in
                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the quarries of this limestone, in some cases present a similar appearance from the

effect of weathering, and also to the circumstance, that some of the irregularities

seen upon the faces of the blocks seem to approach in character to those produced

in other limestones by these causes.

Dr. Daubeny, in conclusion, referred to the paper he had read last year on the

Tyrol, in which he had attempted to explain the appearances presented by the dolo-

mitic rocks of that country, on principles similar to what he now suggested as ap-

plicable to those exhibited on the small scale in our own rocks.

      On a neio Product obtained fr,om Coal Napldha. By Mr. Leigh.

    The substance described was obtained in the course of some investigations on an
oil which Mr. Leigh discovered about three years and a half ago, as the result of the
action of a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids on purified coal' naphtha. In their
behaviour with potassa, both in aqueous and alcoholic solution, the crystals now
brought under the notice of the section by Mr. Leigh have much analogy with the
oil (like that of bitter almonds) obtained at the same time with them. The oil, when
extensively exposed to the action of oxj'gen, becomes a crystalline solid, having much
the same appearance as these crystals. It is probable the crystals differ from the oil
in containing a quantity of oxygen. Mr. Leigh had made no analysis of these
compounds.

The basis of this collection existed in the Museum of the Mining Department pre-
vious to the appointment of Professor Mohs. Under the presidency of Prince Au-
gustus Lobkowicz the Museum was considerably augmented, both by the exertions
of the mining department and by contributions from private collectors. The method
of arrangement employed in the Museum was suggested by Mohs himself, and fol-

lowed out by Prof. Haidinger after the death of the former ; it consisted in dividing
the mineral products of the empire into four great general divisions, having in the
centre those obtained from the rivers, and those procured from the principal chains
of mountains as the boundaries on either side. The cabinets were so arranged as to
form a kind of section of the various geological formations. The upper portions of
the cabinets are filled with the rocks and minerals from the higher or mountainous
districts, whilst the lower divisions contain the specimens taken from the valleys.
This arrangement has been found greatly to assist the memory, and to afford nume-

rous points of comparison to those who study the constitution of the mountain
chains. The Professor concluded by some speculations on the changes which gra-
dually take place in the metamorphic rocks, and which he considered might all be

reduced to processes of oxidation or reduction.

On the Physical Structure of the Appalachian Cham, as exemplifying the Laius

   Bywhich have regulated the elevation of great Mountain Chains generally.
   Professors H. D. Rogers and W. B. Rogers.

   The Appalachian Chain of North America is described by the authors as consisting
of a series of very numerous parallel ridges or anticlinal lines, forming a mountain belt
generally 100 miles in breadth and nearly 1200 miles in length, stretching from the
south-eastern angle of Lower Canada to Northern Alabama. 1. The strata which
compose this chain are the American representatives of the Silurian, Devonian and
Carboniferous systems of Europe, united into one group of conformable deposits.
The general direction of the chain being N.E. and S.W., there is a remarkable pre-
dominance of S.E. dips throughout its entire length, especially in the south-east-
ern or most disturbed side of the belt. Proceeding north-westwards, or from the
quarter of greatest disturbance, N.VV. dips begin to appear; at first few and very
steep, afterwards frequent and gradually less inclined. 2. The authors consider the
frequency of dips to the S.E., or towards the region of intrusive rocks, accounted for
                          TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.        41

by the nature of the flexures, which are not symmetric, the strata being more inclined
on the N.W. than on the S.E. of each anticlinal, amounting at length to a complete

folding under and inversion, especially on the S.E. side of the chain, where the con-

tortions are so closely packed as to present a uniform dip to the S.E. These folds

gradually open out, the N.W. side or inverted portion of each flexure becomes verti-

cal,  or  dips  abruptly  to  the  N.W.                        proceeding further in this direction the dips gra-
                                                            ;

dually lessen, the anticlinals and troughs becoming rounder and flatter, and the in-

tervals between the axes constantly increasing till they entirely subside at about 150
miles from the region of gneiss and intrusive rocks. The authors express their belief

that a similar obliquity of the anticlinal axes will be found to obtain in all great

mountain chains, the axis plane always dipping towards the region of chief disturbance.

The inverted flexures are regarded by the authors as exhibiting simply a higher de-

velopment of the same general conditions. The passage of inverted flexure into
faults is stated to occur frequently, and invariably along the N.W. side of the anti-

clinal or S.E. of the synclinal axes j these dislocations, like the axes, maintain a re-

markable parallelism. 3. The axes of the Appalachian chain are distributed in na-

tural groups, the members of each group agreeing approximately in length, curvature,

amount of flexure and distance apart. Nine principal groups are described, in five of

which the axes are straight, whilst the four which alternate with them are curved j
in two of the curved divisions the line of strike is convex to the N.W., in the other

two it is convex to the S.E. In every part of the chain, the axes, whether curved or

straight, maintain an approximate parallelism to those of their own division, and in

the minor groups within the large divisions the parallelism is still more exact. The

axes vary in length from insignificant flexures to lines frequently 100 and sometimes

150 miles in length, and they deviate very little from a rectilinear course, or, as the
case may be, from a uniform rate of curvature. Some of the longer curved axes

exhibit a difference of strike at their extremities of fifty degrees in a distance of ninety

miles, and the rectilinear axes of different divisions vary in their line of direction as
much as 60°. As all the flexures were undoubtedly formed at one period, the authors

consider these facts at variance with M. Beaumont's hypothesis, that dislocations of

the same geological age are parallel to one and the same great circle of the sphere.

4. The general declension in level of the Appalachian strata towards the N. W., or

away from the quarter of greatest local disturbance, is considered important by the

authors in its bearing upon the subject of the elevation of broad continental tracts.
The authors next proceed to notice memoirs, describing what they consider similar

phaenomena in Europe.

--- Theory of Flexure and Elevation of Strata. From the consideration of the pre-

ceding general facts the authors have arrived at a theory which they conceive appli-

cable to the bending and elevation of strata generally. They state that the oblique

form of all normal anticlinal and synclinal flexures "indicates that the force produ-

--cing the dips was compounded of a wave-like oscillation and a tangential pressure;"
    a purely vertical force exerted simultaneously or successively along parallel lines

could only produce a series of symmetrical flexures, whilst tangential pressure, unac-

companied by a vertical force, would result in an imperceptible bulging of the whole

region, or in irregular plications dependent on local irregularities in the amount of

resistance. The alternate upward and downward movements necessary to enable
the tangential force to bend the strata into a series of flexures, are such " as would

arise from a succession of actual waves rolling in a given direction beneath the earth's

crust." With this view all the phaenomena observed are in accordance ; but it would

be difficult to account for them by any gradual prolonged pressure exerted either

vertically or horizontally. The formation of grand yet simple flexures cannot be ex-

plained by a repetition of feeble tangential movements, which could not successively

accord in direction and amplitude, nor by merely vertical pressures, for these could

not shift in position through a series of parallel lines, nor if feeble and often repeated

return always to the same lines, until they became conspicuous flexures. The authors

suppose the strata of the region in question to have been subjected to excessive upward

tension arising from the expansion of molten matter and gaseous vapours; the tension

would at length be relieved by many parallel fissures formed in succession, through

which much elastic vapour would escape, and, by thus removing the pressure adjacent

to the lines of fracture, produce violent pulsations on the surface of the fluid below.
--42 . EEPORT 1842.

This oscillatory movement would communicate a series of temporary flexures to the
overlying crust, which would be rendered permanent by the intrusion of molten matter
into the fractured strata. If during this oscillation we conceive the whole heaving
tract to be shoved bodily forward in the direction of the waves, the union of this
tangential with the vertical movements may explain the peculiar steepening of the
anterior side of each flexure, and successive similar operations might occasion under
folding or inversion. The authors do not deem it essential to this explanation, that,
in the production of axes of elevation, the strata should be permanently fractured to
the surface. Fissures sufficient for the escape of vast bodies of elastic vapour, might
open and close again superficially; and the strata may often be supported in their
new position by subterranean injections not visible on the surface.

  --Identity of the Undulations which produced the Axes, with the wave-like motion of the

Earth in Earthquake*. The authors suppose all earthquakes to consist in oscillations
of the earth's crust propagated with extreme rapidity ; and they ascribe this move-
ment to a sudden change of vertical pressure on the surface of an interior fluid mass,
throwing it into wave-like undulations, such as would produce permanent flexures in
the strata if more energetic, and if accompanied by the formation of dykes. The
successive earthquakes of any region usually proceed from the same quarter of the
compass, as must have been the case with the movements which gave rise to the
parallelism of neighbouring anticlinal axes. In illustration of the power of producing
permanent lines of elevation which earthquakes have exhibited in modern times,
the authors instance specially the Ullah Bund, an elevated mound extending fifty
miles across the eastern arm of the Indus, which was the result of the great earthquake
ofCutchin 1819.

 --Date of the Appalachian Axes. The authors describe the elevation of this chain as

simultaneous with the termination of the carboniferous deposits of the United States,
and as the cause which probably arrested the further progress of the coal formation.
With one local exception, on the Hudson, the whole series seems to have been depo-
sited conformably,without any emergence of the land. That the elevation did not take
place at a later period, is shown by the undisturbed condition of the overlying beds,
proximately of the age of the European new red sandstone. The elevation of the chief
part of the great belt of metamorphic rocks on the S.E. side of the chain is referred
to the same great movement. In conclusion, the authors remark that an incompa-
rably greater change in the physical geography of North America, and perhaps of the
globe, seems to have occurred at the close of the carboniferous epoch than at any
previous or subsequent epoch ; and they consider these changes, and the effect pro-
duced by them on the organic world, as affording some of the highest subjects of geo-

logical investigation.

On the Production of Sa?id Storms and Lacustrine Beds, by causes associated
     with the North American Lakes. By ilie Rev. Mr. Schoolcraft.

  A residence of nearly twenty years in the country whose physical geography is

strongly marked by the North American Lakes, had impressed the author with the
opinion, that these lakes afford a very striking example of the power of geological
action possessed, at the present day, by large bodies of inland water. For more than
half the indicated period his location had been in the immediate vicinity of Lake
Superior, and the present remarks are confined chiefly to that member of the series.

   Lake Superior itself may be considered as occupying an interstice between the
most northerly portions of the great secondary and sedimentary formations of the
Mississippi valley and the crystalline rocks of British America ; and this ancient line
of junction may be followed, down its outlet, through the Straits of St. Mary's into
Lake Huron, and is continued along parts of its north and north-easterly shores, north

of the fossiliferous limestones of the Manatouline chain.

The western and northern sections of this lake exhibit the strongest proofs of

Aancient action and upheaval.  colossal dyke of trap appears to have crossed the

lake, at about two-thirds of its length from east to west. Admitting (what appears to
be very probable) that the vast bed of the lake west of this dyke was originally pro-
duced by the sinking down of the strata and the consequent elevation of its shores,

we may attribute to the same disturbing force the central breach and prostration of
                                   ;

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  43

this barrier, which has been subsequently widened by the force of waters, acting under
the pressure of strong west and north-west winds, at an epoch when its water-line
rested at one of its higher levels ; so that, at this time, Isle Royal, Beaver and Castle
islands, and the elevated and precipitous range of Keweena Point, all of which con-
sist of members of the trap rock, are the only existing monuments of this ancient
dyke. The heavy beds of trap boulders which lie east of this point, and reach, in
blocks of large magnitude, to St. Mary's Falls and the northern shores of Lake

Huron, strongly denote the probability of such action.
   The most extensive effects of the existing energies of this lake are witnessed upon

its grauwacke and sandstones, which have been broken up, comminuted into fine
sand, and piled up in elevated ridges, or spread out over wide plains along its south-

ern margin. A coast of winding bays and headlands, which measures, by a reduced

computation, 450 miles upon this single section, may be conjectured to have en-
countered heavy inroads from currents forced across the lake by north winds, or
acting diagonally from the north-east or north-west. By far the most extensive field
of this action occurs between the easterly termination of the primary series of rocks
at or near Granite Point, and their re-appearaace in the elevated mountainous
range of Gros Cape at the head of St. Mary's Straits. The vast sand dunes on this
section, to which the French Couriers du Bois early applied the name of Les Grandes
Sables, constitute a most unique and picturesque object. Their perfect aridity and
height above the lake, which has been computed at 300 feet, and the general paral-
lelism of the tops of the series of hills, strongly fix attention. These sandy eleva-
tions are found, however, to rest on beds of clay, loam, and gravel, of a compact
structure, which are only buried beneath a deep coating or upper stratum of
loose yellow 6and, manifestly washed up by the waves and driven landward by
 the winds. Tempests of sand are thus formed, which spread inland, bury or kill
 the tallest trees, and carry destruction and desolation in their track. Such is also
 the lake action upon districts of the coasts of Huron and Michigan, the two next
in the descending series of the lakes. Dunes are at first formed, which spread inland,
 carrying sterility over thousands of acres of land formerly fertile and well-wooded
 and the tendency of this peculiar formation is constantly to extend its limits and
 arrest, as with the hand of death, the progress of vegetation. Another effect of these
 sand-rocks is to form ponds and lagoons at the temporary or fixed points of their
terminus on the good land, and thus to destroy and render unfit for the use of man

 other large belts of country ; besides which, these arrested waters are the prolific
 sources of noxious vapours, generating extensive disease in their vicinity. Evidence
 of the comparatively recent era of this atmospheric formation is seen in the pro-
 strated and buried trees, freshwater shells and other organic substances, in a perfectly
 unaltered state, which are in some localities noticed in digging at great depths, and
 sometimes exposed by recent irruptions of the waves.

    Another arenaceous formation clue to lake action cannot be mistaken in exami-
 ning these shores, but is of an earlier age, when these lakes stood at a more elevated
 level, and discharged over their eventual outlet at Niagara a greater volume of water.
 " I allude to large belts and tracts of sandy plains bordering other sections of the lakes,
 and bearing a light growth of pines, poplars and birch, which but imperfectly conceal

 their comparatively recent origin. On penetrating these plains ridges of sand occur,
 lying in wind-rows, as if recently formed by the winds and waves. The trees are of
 small diameter, and the wood of a loose and bad texture. The pent-up water be-

 tween these ridges nourishes an aquatic vegetation, and constitutes a favourite retreat
 for the small-furred animals. The whole aspect of these plains denotes them to be
 of freshwater origin, and forces the conclusion, that they must have emerged, at no
 ancient period, from the watery dominion of the lakes. That these lakes stood, in
 bygone days, at a higher altitude, that they had several epochs of depression, and
 were thus endowed with far greater powers of geological action, is clearly denoted by
 the existing water-lines on the mural faces of these rocks, and by the ancient water-
 edges of pebble beds and lake exuvise found at elevated points in the interior."

    The power of attrition possessed by these lakes, at this day, is so complete upon

 the sandstone series, as to allow full scope to the principle of gravitation in the re-
 arrangement of the comminuted and up-heaved materials. Large portions of the

 magnetic oxide of iron exist in the northern sandstones. As these surcharged strata
--44 report 1842.

are ground down in the great laboratory of the lake, this oxide is liberated from

its siliceous connexion, and reproduced upon the shores in separate and pure beds

of iron sand, which are not unfrequently twelve or fourteen inches in thickness, and

line the shores for miles.

  Wave action is indeed more fully apparent as a mechanical power on the southern

shores of Superior, than at any other known point in the interior of the continent.

The actual process, both of degradation and resistance, in the lighter-coloured and

non-metallic sandstone, is nowhere better observed than along the walled and abraded

coast, locally known under the name of the Pictured Rocks. About twelve miles of

this mural coast is most completely fretted and riddled into curious architectural

Whenforms by the force of equinoctial gales. "  I first saw this picturesque part of the

coast in 1820, a vast and high headland hung in fearful grandeur over the water, the

base of which was supported on pillars of the sandstone rock, forming a single arch

of gigantic span with several minor arches. This prominence, locally called Le Por-

tail, gave way the next year, throwing into the deep recesses of the lake walled masses

of stone, of which it will convey some estimate to add, that for every ton of rock that

went down with the Table rock at Niagara, one thousand tons were here engulphed.

Some angular points of this engulphed stratum are yet visible above the water, but

the latter is annually exerting its strong abrasive powers upon these rock ruins and

casting up the product in beach sands."

Notice of a Memoir on the Geology of the Western States of North America,

  by David Dale Owen, M.D., of Indiana. By R. I. Murchison,

   Pres. G.S.

   This memoir, with sections and characteristic fossils, having been sent to the
Geological Society of London, was brought to Manchester in transitu by a friend and
countryman of the author. Perceiving the great value of this communication, the

President of the Geological Society, to whom it was consigned, conceived that

greater justice might be done to the author by first exhibiting the fossils and sec-
tions to the Geological Section of the British Association, and by giving on his own
part a brief expose of the chief results of Dr. Dale Owen's labours, which in the
sequel would find their appropriate resting-place in the Transactions of the Geologi-

cal Society.

   The vast country in which the author had pursued his researches for a series of
years, in the capacity of state geologist of Indiana, embraces the states of Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Dubuque and Mineral Point districts of
Jowa and Wisconsin.

    Illustrating his views by a general section across this region, he shows that the
lowest rocks consist of various members of the Silurian system, the chief masses of
which occupying high grounds in the east and west, subside in the central districts
under an enormous trough of carboniferous limestone and great productive coal-
fields, the whole being overtopped by the equivalents of the cretaceous system of
Europe. Identifying many Silurian and carboniferous fossils with their types in
Great Britain, the author shows that the old red or Devonian rocks are less distinctly
developed in this than in the adjoining region to the East. At the same time he
points out that the Pentremite limestone occupies such an intermediate position as
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  45

may entitle it to be referred either to the base of the carboniferous or to the upper
part of the Devonian system.

   The great lead-bearing magnesian limestone of Ohio and Indiana (Silurian) is

stated to agree in great part with that of Niagara.
   After thus giving a general sketch of the Memoir, the President then called the at-

tention of the Meeting to the very valuable collection of fossils by which it was illus-
trated, and expressed his belief that their study, and a close comparison of them
with the typical forms of the same age in the British Isles, would lead to very curious
results touching the distribution of animal life in deposits of synchronous date found
at great distances from each other, and in which the variations in the same species
would be found to be analogous to those which now prevail in living nature in similar
species which inhabit basins remote from each other.

   The President, in highly eulogizing the merits of Dr. Dale Owen, begged to re-
mind the Meeting that the coal-field of which he treated was nearly as large as all

England.

On the Geological Structure of Russia (delivered at an Evening Lecture).
                        By R. I. Murchison, Pres. G.S.

   Mr. Murchison gave a general sketch of the geological structure of Russia in Eu-
rope and the Ural Mountains, which was illustrated by numerous large coloured sec-
tions and a map. In explaining the chief results of the labours of his friends Count
Keyserling, M. de Verneuil, and himself, he showed how the researches of two
summers had enabled them to produce a classification of the sedimentary deposits
which exclusively occupy the flat regions of Russia, where they are exempt from the
intrusion of igneous rocks; and also how the older members of the series, when
altered by such igneous agency, as in the Ural Mountains, were the seat of various
ores and minerals.

    After pointing out that, from the very distinct characters of the fossils of each
group of the palaeozoic rocks, the divisions of Silurian, Devonian (or old red) and
carboniferous strata were unequivocally sustained over an enormous area, he stated
that these masses were surmounted by a great development of red sands, marls and con-
glomerates, with beds of magnesian limestone, salt and gypsum, the whole constitu-
ting a system which is the equivalent of that group in western Europe of which the
zechstein or magnesian limestone is the centre. Insisting upon the independence
of the Permian rocks (so called because most spread out in Permia), as proved by
their imbedded fauna and flora, including thecodont saurians and plants of peculiar
forms, Mr. Murchison dwelt upon the singularity of this vast deposit, in being to so
great an extent impregnated with copper ores, which mixed with the sand, grit
and marl, form regular beds, the origin of which he referred to ancient cupriferous
sources having flowed from the Ural Mountains, when the Permian strata were accu-
mulating in an adjacent sea. Passing rapidly over the consideration of the secondary
and tertiary deposits, Mr. Murchison then made some statements confirmatory of his
opinions expressed at the Glasgow Meeting of the British Association, concerning
the transport of the large erratic blocks which cover such large tracts of the northern
and central governments of Russia and the adjacent countries of Germany, which
having been deposited on what he conceives to have been the bottom of a sea, were,
he conceives, carried to their present positions by floating icebergs liberated from

ancient glaciers of the North. On the present occasion he showed, that such

phasnomena, grand as they are, are after all local only, in reference to the surface cf
the planet ; for an examination of the Ural Mountains had convinced him that up to
60° north latitude they never could have been the seat of glaciers, because their flanks
are entirely void of coarse and far-transported detritus, though some of their peaks
rise to upwards of 5000 feet above the sea. In confirmation of this opinion it was
further said, that none of these stria? (which are appealed to as proofs of glacial
action) were observed upon the surface of the Ural rocks, though such marks are
apparent in some of those tracts of Russia in Europe, over which the northern blocks
have been transported.

   Mr. Murchison concluded by a warm compliment to the Emperor, and to the
Russians of all ranks, for the very kind reception, and for the cordial and liberal man-
--46 report 1842.

ner in which every assistance was afforded ; and apologizing for his wish to condense
into a brief address the numberless topics to which he wished to have adverted, he
referred the assembly to the Proceedings of the Geological Society, and intimated
that a work and map descriptive of the geology of Russia would soon be offered to

the public.

Contributions to a Geological Sketch of North Asia. By Adolphe Erman,

   Professor at the University of Berlin. (Accompanied by a coloured Geo-
   logical Sketch of the Land between long. 100° and 160° East from Paris,
   lat. 51° and 63° North, and a Collection of 200 Geological Specimens.)

   In addition to a continued series of magnetical observations and other scientific
investigations, the author was led to notice a variety of interesting geological pheno-
mena in the country above defined. The volcano of Klioutchi (14,780 Paris feet in
height), with the streams of lava rushing down (to the height of 8000 feet), and the
clouds of steam of volcanic ashes and cinders, extending to the height of nearly four
English miles, was first noticed; and the author then presents a geographical sketch
of the Valley of the Lena, of the Aldan Mountains, and theMarikan belonging thereto,
and of the immense volcanic area of the Kamtschatkic peninsula.

   The borders of Lake Baikal consist of actual triturative conglomerate, alternating
with granite, and belonging to the coal formation. North-east of this lake is wide
table land 1600 feet above the sea, giving origin to the sources of the Lena, which
flows in a narrow regular valley, with mural cliffs, and having horizontal strata of
sandstone and marls, chiefly of red colour, often ripple-marked. This red formation
occurs also at Oust Kouck with salt and cellular (magnesigenous?) limestone. Near
Kirensk these sandstones foid round a boss of the same limestone in a purer state.
Near Jerbinsk this limestone, in lofty ranges, is largely cavernous, and in the caverns
(200 feet above the river) arc stalactites of ice, which also invests the walls and covers
the floor. Referring to his collection placed on the table, M. Erman here drew at-
tention to an Amphus in the red strata of the Lena, near Krywslouzk, and to the
probability of these red and variegated strata being of the geological age of the De-

vonian group.

   The Aldan Mountains (4000 Paris feet above the sea) show, on the right bank of
the river Aldan, vast limestone rocks of the same kind as those of Jerbinsk in the
valley of the Lena, Up the picturesque cross valley of Bjellaja, these calcareous
rocks extend, and undulate near some dolerites which have broken through them.
At the sources of the Bjellaja river these limestones dip westward, and rest upon

slate rocks. Partially calcareous under the limestone, these bluish-gray slates be-
come purely argillaceous in their deeper masses (" chemically of the nature of mica"),
and beyond" the Allachjuna valley, are followed by grauwacke, occupying a breadth

of thirteen miles, and an elevation from 1500 to 4000 feet. The slates contain some
small traces of coal. Near the slates are mountains of compact siliceous rock,
speckled black hornblende and felspar. It is difficult, especially on going eastward
from Lake Tungor through the Aldan chain, to determine whether these spots are

crystals or fragments. In the pass called Kapiten Mountain, this rock alternates

with conglomerate in vertical strata.

   The watershed of the glacial and the great ocean lies in the third or easternmost
part of the Aldan system, which consists of petrosiliceous porphyry with hornblende
crystals, and judging from the gravel brought down by the affluents to the Ochota,
granite and serpentine exist in this part of the chain.

   Respecting the mineral called Marekanite, M. Erman made some investigations at
Ochotzk, which led him to recognize that these stones occur not merely in loose

pebbles, but in massive rocks.

   On the eastern side of Ochotzk, granite projects in steep cliffs over the sea; then

a fclspathic grauwacke rock, in steeply inclined strata, and containing very thin coal-
beds, as in the grauwacke Aldan Mountains. Near a great dyke of pyroxenic por-
phyry, the strata have been altered by heat to marekanite or pearlstone. In a ravine
the degrees of metambrpnism from this cause may be seen, from the carboniferous
grauwacke through pitchstone with hyaline quartz, to marekanite and trachyte.

   Regarding the volcanoes and the other interesting geological phenomena of the

"beautiful and interesting province of Kamtschatka," M. Errnan referred to his map
and to the specimens on the table. By these means he illustrated the tertiary and

perhaps cretaceous strata of the west coast ; the amygdaloid formation ; the chain of

the now spent volcanoes in the middle of the land ; and the magnificent rows of still
burning cones, and " elevation craters " formed by andisite (viz. albite and horn-
blende), interspersed with a few very remarkable fields of serpentine, clay slates, and

even granite, which seem to have been scarcely altered by volcanic action.

On the Occurrence of Vegetable Remains, supposed to be Marine, in the New
                    Red Sandstone. By John S. Dawes.

The object of this paper is to communicate the fact, that vegetable remains, pro-

bably marine, occur in strata in which they have not, I believe, hitherto been no-

Aticed.  new line of canal is now being formed between Birmingham and the col-

lieries near Tipton, through Gravelly Hill, Perry and Great Barr ; at the latter place

Silurian limestone has been found close to the surface, together with traces of coal
and other carboniferous measures, which appear to dip under the new red sandstone

on the Birmingham side of the axis, thus affording evidence in favour of a recently

expressed opinion, that the South Staffordshire coal-field will, in all probability, be

found to extend under that town. Not any organic remains characteristic of the

lower new red have yet been met with, although other vegetable impressions are

somewhat abundant, particularly in the deep cutting near to the old road from Bir-

mingham to Walsall ; the specimens, however, that have yet been examined, are

perhaps too imperfect to admit of any positive description ; some of them appear to

be fucoids, others possibly are of a higher organization ; they occur imbedded in

dark red, argillaceous, ripple-marked flagstones, and in the adjacent red and light

green-coloured marls, the whole being subordinate to a quartzose sandstone of con-

siderable thickness, containing calcareous conglomerates, identical in composition

with those found on the flanks of Clent, and which are understood to connect the

gres bigarre with the lower part of the saliferous system ; but as these Devonian-

looking beds can scarcely be supposed to belong to the latter division, they must, I

should conceive, be included with the overlying marls, sandstone and conglomerates,

thus constituting a more extensive equivalent of the magnesian limestone. Should

the fossil remains prove to be characteristic, a knowledge of them will materially as-

sist in the examination of this highly important series of rocks.

   On the Microscopic Structure of Coal. By John Phillips, F.R.S.

  Mr. Phillips observed, that there was now no difference of opinion as to the vege-

table origin of coal, but only as regarded the circumstances under which those vege-
table masses were accumulated. In order to determine this, several modes of in-
vestigation might be followed, one of which was to examine the coal itself, in order
to ascertain the nature of the plants of which it was composed. In the microscopic
examination of polished slices of coal, by means of transmitted light, some results
had been obtained by Mr. Hutton of Newcastle ; these observations had not been
published, but he believed Mr. Hutton had detected a cellular structure in the sub-
stance of the Northumberland coal, which at first sight might be imagined of vege-
table origin, but from their size, form and distribution, were rather connected with
the development of gas in the process of chemical changes to which coal had been
subject; analogous cells exist in anthracite. It had been his intention to employ

some of the ingenious processes recommended by the Rev. J. Reade, who had dis-
covered the means of making fossil vegetable tissue apparent to the senses by a pro-
cess of combustion, but having lately observed something remarkable in the com-
bustion of Staffordshire coal, he was induced to examine it microscopically, without
waiting to adopt any more refined process. He observed that the ashes of wood
and peat differed in appearance and structure ; and this Staffordshire coal, which did
not cake, but burned to a white ash, resembled in its combustion sometimes wood, and
sometimes the laminated peat of the north of England, or the compact black peat of
Dartmoor. Upon examining these ashes, he found abundant traces of vegetable
structure, consisting of portions of woody tissue imbedded in other tissue, apparently
of plants much lower in their organization. He had also detected traces of vegetable
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

structure in the ashes of anthracitic coal received from Sir H. De la Beche. Mr. Phil-

lips considered this evidence, as far as he had collected it, rather in favour of the
view that particular beds of coal were in a great measure formed by plants growing
on the spot, and not by drifting : the evidence of such drifting existed in many cases,
and formerly predominated ; but he had met with many phaenomena, and this amongst
them, which tended to diminish the force and generality of his former conclusions.

He was, however, still engaged in the prosecution of this inquiry.

          On the Origin of Coal. By W. C. Williamson, F.G.S.

    In this communication the author had collected all the principal facts and phe-
nomena bearing upon the origin and formation of coal, with the view of proving it
to have originated in the drifting of vegetable matter into the sea, and not by the
accumulated growth on the same spot now occupied by the coal- The strata sepa-
rating the coal seams were described as consisting of a great variety of rocks, from
the coarse deposits and water- worn pebbles of the lower grits to the fine-grained
shales and limestones of Ardwick ; they were acknowledged by all to have been se-
dimentary in their origin, containing the remains of aquatic shells and animals. In
many of these strata, as at Colebrook Dale, the scales and other remains of Mega-
lichthys were found abundantly associated with Orthoceratites, Goniatites, Naticae,
and a variety of other shells whose marine character had never been doubted ; in the
coal-measures of Yorkshire Pectenpapgraccus, several Goniatites, several species of a
genus allied to Modiola, Lingular, Crustaceans allied to the recent marine genera
Cyamus and Cymothoa, were found, with remains of Megalichthys, Palaeoniscus, Pla-
tysomus, and other fish. The abundance of shells commonly considered Unionidse,
did not, in the author's opinion, militate against the marine origin of the former, as
Dr. Fleming mentions having seen the dead shells of Unios, with their valves still
united by the ligament, in abundance at Mount Vernon on the Potomac, and at
Montmorenci on the St. Lawrence, both placed where the tide flows ; and Mr. Wil-
liamson inferred that if the current could carry them so far, some might also reach

the estuaries of those rivers, and become mixed with marine remains. He then de-

scribed the conditions under which vegetable remains, such as Halonia regularis, Ca\a-
mites, Sigillariee, Stigmariae,Lepidodendra, and the fruit of Trigonocarpon, were found
imbedded in the coarse grits and solid sandstones of the Halliwell quarries and Peel.
These remains had all lost their stalks or foliaceous appendages, and were so inti-
mately a part of the sandstone, that if one was drifted the other must have been
transported in the same way. In the beds of shale unconnected with coal, large ac-
cumulations of plants were often found occasionally mixed with Unionidse and mi-
nute Entomostraca, presenting the appearance of having been thrown down together,
after floating about in the water ; the author considered these layers only differed in
amount from the coal-seams ; in one case a large and dense mass of vegetable
matter had formed the material of a bed of coal, in the other the fewness of the

plants and their intermixing with mud, now forming the shale, had limited the pro-
cess to the conversion of each plant into a thin layer of carbonaceous matter. The

author attributed the scarcity of fish-remains in the coal itself to the action by the
same chemical process which had converted the accumulated vegetables into coal
the occurrence of scales of Megalichthys in the cannel coal of Dixon Green and
Wigan, he attributed to some peculiarity in its origin or composition more favour-

able to their preservation. The absence of the usual coal measure plants in the fire-
clay underlying the coal proved, in the author's opinion, a want of any connexion
between the two ; and he was disposed to adopt the view of those who regarded the

Stigmaria of the fire-clay as a marine, or at least aquatic plant, growing in
those estuaries in which the drifted vegetable remains of the higher country would
be sunk, and form a deposit of coal over them ; but he observed that, although
coal rarely occurred without this subjacent layer of stigmaria, yet the latter was fre-

quently found independent of coal. The author proceeded to state what he
considered another proof of the drift origin of coal and associated beds in the dis-
jointed and fragmentary condition of the fossil ferns and other plants, and the almost
universal absence of their rhizomas and roots, which he stated he could only account
for by supposing the remains had been long exposed to the action of water in rapids
      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  49

and violent currents. The absence or rarity of distinct traces of fructification was
also an argument in favour of their being drifted; as in the oolitic deposits of Gris-
thorpe-bay, which afforded evidence of comparatively tranquil deposition in fresh
water, the fronds were not merely grouped together by their rhizomas, but afforded
frequent indications of fructification. The prevalence of fine-grained shales imme-

diately over coal seams was, in the author's opinion, highly unfavourable to the
theory which accounted for the origin of coal by subsidences ; for if a sudden subsi-
dence had taken place, a deposit of water-worn pebbles would have been strewed over
the coal, indicating the violent action of aqueous currents; and if the submergence

were slow and gradual, the plants, as before argued, would be found much more per-
fect, as any currents sufficient to tear up the vegetation would also strew the surface
with detritus ; the absence of unconformability in the members of the coal-measure
was also hostile to the idea of partial depressions. The argillaceous partings, which

constantly occurred in coal seams, also favoured the supposition of a considerable
amount of drifting. Mr. Williamson concluded by attempting to explain the upright
position of the trees at Dixon-fold on the Bolton Railway, without having recourse
to the supposition that they grew on the spot ; one of these trees was described by

Mr. Bowman as having its base raised fifteen inches above the surface of the coal, the

roots only being in contact, which Mr. Williamson considered could not be accounted
for by any condensation of the vegetable remains afterwards constituting the coal
seam. One of the largest of these trees presented no trace of roots, which were
more likely to be preserved than any other portion. As to their erect position, he
considered the weight of their strong branching roots would be sufficient to main-
tain them erect in water until a deposit of sediment and drift should accumulate
round their bases ; whilst the absence of trunks inclined at various angles might be
accounted for by pressure, which would soon reduce all that were not absolutely
vertical to a horizontal position. One of the greatest objections in the author's
mind to the drift theory was, the great extent and uniformity ofsome of the thin seams
of coal, especially in the lower measures; he thought, however, the accumulation of
vegetable remains in which these seams originated might have been as great as in
many of the larger coal seams, but that in the chemical changes which they had un-
dergone, a larger proportion of the gaseous elements had escaped, leaving the

mass both thinner and less unequal in thickness than at first. He also mentioned the

laminated appearance of peat-bogs in the vicinity of Manchester, as exhibiting by
its illustration of the structure of coal a fact favourable to the hypothesis which he
had been combating; and stated that as the true explanation of the phaenomena was
the only end he sought, he was ready to accept that view if the difficulties attend-
ing it could be explained on rational grounds.

On the Great Lancashire Coal Field. By E. W. Binney, Sec. Geol. Soc.

      of Manchester.

This carboniferous deposit, generally known as the Lancashire Coal Field, occu-

pies the chief part of the southern division of the county of Lancaster, and extends

into portions of the adjoining counties of Chester, Derby and York, in a line from

near Macclesfield to Colne it ranges about 46 miles due N. and S., and from Tarbock

to Todmorden about 40 miles from W.S.W. to E.N.E. It commences with the

lower millstone grit, and extends upwards into the limestone of Ardwick, near Man-

chester, now generally considered the highest portion of the coal measures hitherto

observed in England. The author divides this series into three groups in descending

--order : 1. The Manchester coal-field, containing the limestone of Ardwick, and the

isolated coal-measures of Clayton and Bradford, near Manchester, occupying the

low tract of country adjoining the new red sandstone plains.--2. The middle field,

comprising the thick coal seams of Poynton, Ashton, Middleton, Worsley, Wigan,

&c, occupying the rising ground between the new red sandstone plains and the

--higher parts of the country, and containing the richest portion of the field. 3. The

lower coal-seams, found in the elevated parts of the country, along the sides of the

Penine chain, and the moorlands of the northern parts of Lancashire ; comprising

those of Whaley Bridge, Mellor, Glossop, Rochdale, Todmorden, Colne, Blackburn,

--Chorley, &c. seams of no great thickness, but valuable from their quality and po-

sition, and remarkable from their adjoining shales containing remains of the genera

Pecten, Goniatites, Posidonia, and other shells of marine origin. The total thick-
ness of the deposits varies in different parts of the field; in a line from Manchester,
through Ashton, to the limestone shales of Hollins Brook, the thickness is about
2000 yards; and there are 75 beds of coal exceeding one foot in thickness, forming
altogether 150 feet. In a line throngh Worsley, Bury, Burnley, &c, to the lime-
stone shales of Pendlehill, there are 36 seams, only ten of which are less than one
foot in thickness, amounting to 93 feet of coal ; in these sections the smaller seams
are not taken into account. The author states that the variable character of these
coal seams and the accompanying strata, make it difficult to lay them down upon a
map ; the lower seams can be classed by the gritstone rocks which contain them, as
shown by Mr. Elias Hall, but the middle and upper seams divide and thin out in
such a manner as to render their identification very difficult. He then proceeds to
describe the roofs, or strata immediately overlying the coal seams, the coal itself, and
the floors or strata immediately underlying the beds of coal.

  --I. Roofs. The deposits forming the roofs vary at different places, even over the
--same seam. There are four kinds of roofs : 1. A fine mixture of alumina and silica,

with oxide of iron, and a trace of the carbonates of iron and lime ; these are generally
known as blue binds, and are of most frequent occurrence ; they almost always con-
tain ferns, and remains of Stigmaria, Sigillaria, Ulodendron and Lepidodendron, and
beds of the Unio and other shells. The Sigillariae, &c. are often found standing
erect at right angles to the planes of stratification ; these instances chiefly occur in
the middle field, at Pendleton, Dixon-fold, Wigan, &c. Sometimes they are found
with their roots running into and resting on the seams, and more frequently the hole
of the tree rests on the coal itself, without exhibiting any trace of roots. The Sigil-

lariae are by far the most common ; at Pendleton and Dixon-fold they occur as abun-
dantly as they could possibly have grown : the author had observed three specimens

at Pendleton, 24 feet high and about 3 feet in circumference, standing in a shaft 11
feet in diameter. 2. Roofs of sandstone are not common, and where they do occur
the coal is generally inferior in quality; the fossils found in the sandstone are usually
prostrate coal plants, Stigmaria;, Sec. 3. Black shale roofs are frequent, and cover
most of the best house-fire and caking coal; they seldom contain plants, though, in
a few instances, upright Sigillarias have been found. Bivalve shells, detached scales
and teeth of fish frequently occur in them, and with the Microeonchus carbonarius
and casts of Cyprides sometimes constitute nearly the entire mass; almost all the
black shale roofs of the lower field teem with remains of Pecten, Goniatites, Posi-
donia, and remains of fishes. 4. Shales ivith highly bituminous schists, forming roofs,
are not of frequent occurrence; they are found at Peel and Pendleton, and contain
abundant remains of fish, mostly entire. At Bradford and at Ardwick, in the roof of
the thin coat intercalated with the limestones, the detached teeth, bones and scales of

--fish occur, mingled with countless myriads of the remains of Cypris and Microeonchus.
   II, Coal and Cannel Seams. The author describes two varieties of coal, the cubical
where the cross cleavage runs at right angles to the main cleavage, and the rhom-
boidal where it makes an acute angle; the first form generally occurs in the upper
and lower portions of the field, the latter orevails in the middle. The main cleavage,
he observes, is in most cases parallel witfi the principal fault in the vicinity. The
beds of cannel are generally found on the top of the coal, and nearly always contain
remains of fishes, often bivalve shells, but hitherto have exhibited no trace of Micro-
eonchus, and rarely any leaves or stems of plants, whilst the upper portion of coal
seams frequently exhibit traces of Sigillarias, Lepidodendra, Calamites, &c. In the
six-feet seam at the new pit of the Pendleton Company, several rounded stones of
fine siliceous grit were found, but as they occurred near the great fault of 1 000 yards,
they might have fallen in during the dislocation. The coal seams are either simple,
and continue undivided over large tracts of country, or split and divide into several
distinct seams ; the former generally occur in the lower portion of the field, the lat-
ter in the middle and upper part. It is owing to this tendency to divide, that the
thick seams of Clifton and Radcliffe cannot be well identified with the thinner and
more numerous seams of Oldham, Ashton and Bradbury; in the four-feet mine at
Pendleton the author has observed that the coal on the N.W. forms one undivided
seam of 5 feet in thickness, but that towards the S.W. a thin bed of fireclay full of
Stigmaria; appears in it; and in Mr. Fitzgerald's pit to the S.E. it gradually thickens
until at a distance of 900 yards from the point first observed, it has increased to 3
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  51

feet, separating the coal into two distinct seams. At Alkrington the two Beat Mines
are worked together, but to the S.E. a parting of fire-clay appears, which gradually
increases in thickness, and at Oldham, 3 miles distant, the two Beat Mines are worked
 10 yards apart; other instances of subdivision are known, all of them taking place
towards the S. and S.E. Independently of the tendency to divide, many seams di-
minish in thickness till they become evanescent; this is chiefly observable in the
lower division of the coal-field, and in the simple seams six beds which have been
worked in that series, give decisive evidence of this fact. The best examples are the
caking coal of Rochdale and the Foot mines, beds known by various names in different
parts of the country, but easily identified by the remarkable nature of their floor,
which is a hard crystalline stone, called Ganister, full of Stigmaria ficoides, and em-
ployed as a material for mending roads. At Dulesgate, near Todmorden, the upper
or " Ganister coal " is 5 feet 8 inches in thickness, and the Foot coal, about 12
yards below it, is 7 inches thick; the author has traced these seams about 11 miles
to Quarlton, and ascertained that the Ganister coal gradually diminishes in thick-
ness to one inch, while the Foot coal increases to two feet, the floors retaining the
same character throughout.

  --III. Coal Floors. The stratum on which the coal rests is always carefully noticed

by practical miners, who believe that where a thin seam is found on a thick argil-
laceous floor full of Stigmatise, it is certain to become workable if followed. The
floors are of three kinds-- the fire clay, which is the most abundant; the warrant, a
clay mixed with a larger amount of silica, occurring frequently ; and the rock floors,
of which but two instances are known, namely, the floor of the Featheredge coal at
Walmersley, which is a rough quartzose sandstone, and the Ganister, before no-
ticed. The latter is merely a fine-grained admixture of silica and alumina, varying
from 8 inches to 2 feet in thickness, always graduating into a fine fire-clay at its bot-

tom. All the floors, with the exception of the rock floor of the Featheredge coal,
contain Stigmaria ficoides, from the thin seams of the Ardwick limestone, to the two
seams in the millstone grit of Gauxholme, near Todmorden, a thickness of nearly
1600 yards; all the fifteen floors of the Manchester coal-field contain it, and at least

69 beds in the middle and lower divisions. The Stigmaria generally occurs with its
leaves attached, and in all instances of true floors without any intermixture of other
plants. These facts seem to indicate that all the deposits were formed under nearly
similar conditions ; the roofs and floors were evidently very quietly deposited, and
formed a strong clay, well adapted for the growth of the vast masses of vegetable
matter required for the formation of the coal seams. The absence of alkalies in the
clay of the floors, might be expected from the exhausting properties of plants, and
seems to strengthen the supposition that these beds supported the vegetation which
now constitutes the coal. The remains of bivalve shells and fishes in the cannel beds,
prove that they were formed under water; but in the Lancashire coal-field no re-
mains cf fishes or shells have yet been found in the coal, nor is there any indication,
either by admixture of sand or silt in the seams of coal, to show that they were
drifted into the places they now occupy by rapid currents of water. The occurrence
of forests of large trees standing upright on the seams, the pure vegetable matter
composing the coal itself, with scarce any admixture of foreign ingredients, the posi-
tion of the coal upon a rich alluvial deposit well adapted to sustain a luxuriant vege-
tation, seem to prove that, in most instances, the vegetable matter forming it grew
upon the spot where the coal is now found ; whilst the splitting and alterations in
the thickness of the seams themselves, show that the surface was most probably sub-

ject to frequent subsidence.

logue of all the fossils yet discovered in each of the subdivisions of the Irish moun-
tain limestone series, in the strata of North Devon, and in the mountain limestone
of Great Britain, arranged in parallel columns for the purpose of comparison ; the
notice was also illustrated by coloured sections.

    Mr. Griffith stated that his object in this communication was to prove, by the evi-
dence of fossils, that the lower members of the mountain series of Ireland, as arranged
by him, really belonged to that series, and not to the old red sandstone, as advocated

by some geologists. He described this series as containing two great bands of lime-

stone, which he had denominated the upper and lower limestones ; interposed between
these limestones were beds of shale, argillaceous limestone and sandstone, forming a
series of great thickness, known by the name oi calp) or calp slate. Beneath the lower
limestone was a second series of schistose beds, to which he had given the name car-
boniferous slate ; under the slate was a series of sandstone beds, frequently interca-
lated with slate or shale, and occasionally with limestone; he had denominated this
 deposit the yellow sandstone; its lower beds rested conformably on the old red sand-
 stone. Mr. Griffith stated, that those beds varied in thickness at different localities,
but that the relative position of each member of the series was always the same;

the upper and lower limestones were generally more persistent than the other mem-
bers of the series. In some localities the carboniferous slate and yellow sandstone
 were altogether wanting ; in others the carboniferous slate only was absent, the lower

 limestone resting directly on the yellow sandstone. In the northern and middle dis-
tricts of Ireland, the calp formed a very thick and important member of the series,
 but gradually thinned out towards the south ; it had not yet been discovered in the
 counties of Cork and Waterford, and was only occasionally traceable in Clare, Lime-
 rick and Kerry. In the middle district, the upper limestone formed the distinguishing
 feature ; in the southern section, the upper and lower limestones were most abun-
 dant, and the calp least so, whilst the carboniferous slate and yellow sandstone oc-
 cupied an inconsiderable superficial extent, but were important, as they contained a
 great variety of fossils. The carboniferous slate of the South of Ireland differed con-
 siderably in lithological character from that of the middle and northern regions, but

 the number of fossils common to the beds which occupy the same geological position
 in all three districts, showed the necessity of including the whole in one division. In

 the tables of fossils before mentioned, the occurrence of each species in the different
 members of the Irish series, was indicated for each of the three districts, and also

 their occurrence in North Devon, and in the English mountain limestone. From
 these general tables, Mr. Griffith had prepared tables of results, showing the number
 of fossils of each class occurring in every division of the mountain limestone of Ire-
 land ; those peculiar to it, those common to it, and all the other members of the
 series, those that are common to each of the other divisions, and also those that are
 common to the mountain limestone of Great Britain, and to North Devon. Some

 of the results obtained were as follows : Yellow sandstone, out of 122 fossils, 9 were

 peculiar to it: 113, or 92^ percent., common to the mountain limestone of Ireland
 generally; 49 species, or 40 per cent., common to the upper limestone; 87. or 71

 per cent., to the calp ; 75, or 61 per cent., to the lower limestone, and 94, or 77 per

 cent., common to the carboniferous slate; 35 species, or 30 per cent., were common

--to North Devon; and 59, or 48 per cent., to the mountain limestone of Great Britain.
     Carboniferous slate, of 275 fossils, 12 were peculiar to it ; 263, or 95J per cent.,

 common to the mountain limestone of Ireland generally; 99, or 36 per cent., com-
 mon to the upper limestone; 176, or 64 per cent., to the calp; 162, or 60 percent.,
 to the lower limestone; and 94, or 34 per cent., common to the yellow sandstone;
 65 species, or 24 per cent., were common to North Devon ; and 139, or 50 per cent.,
 to the mountain limestone of Great Britain. From these data Mr. Griffith concluded,

 that the yellow sandstone, which contained 92J per cent., and the carboniferous slate,

 which contained 95| per cent, of fossils common to the other members of the moun-

  tain limestone of Ireland, must belong to that series. Mr. Griffith next proceeds to
  consider whether the mouutain limestone of Ireland generally should be classed with
  that of Great Britain. By the table of results it appeared, that out of 180 species of

 fossils obtained from the upper limestone, 133, or 73 per cent., were common to the

  British mountain limestone ; of the calp, out of 267 species, 148, or 55 per cent., and
  of the lower limestone, out of 391 fossils, 234, or 60 per cent., of the carboniferous
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  5.3

slate 50 per cent., and of the yellow sandstone 48 per cent., as already mentioned,
were common to the British mountain limestone ; and if the entire series were taken,
it appeared that out of 430 species which had been described as occurring in that

series, 287, or 67 per cent., were common to the mountain limestone of Ireland.
Hence he concluded, that the mountain limestones of Great Britain and Ireland be-

longed to the same geological suite, though the Irish series generally, and particularly
the lower members, contained a great number of species, which had not hitherto been
discovered in the British. From the foregoing data there appeared to be a greater
affinity between the upper limestone of Ireland and the British mountain limestone,
than between it and the other members of the Irish series. Again, the upper lime-

stone of Ireland contained only 16 species of fossils, or 8 per cent., which were com-

mon to North Devon, while the calp contained 43, or 16 per cent., the lower lime-

stone 39, or 10 per cent., the carboniferous slate 65, or 24 per cent., and the yellow

sandstone 35, or 29 per cent., in common with the same series. Thus there appeared

to be a nearly regular gradation from the upper portion of the mountain limestone
of Ireland into the upper Devonian; and although, owing to the predominance of
ordinary mountain limestone fossils, the per-centage is not considerable even in the

lower members, yet by reference to the table of results it appeared, that out of 122
species of fossils from North Devon, 80, or 65§ per cent., occurred in the mountain
limestone of Ireland; and hence Mr. Griffith concluded, that hardly a doubt could

be entertained as to the propriety of attaching the fossils of North Devon to the
mountain limestone series of Ireland. He considered this a startling result, and one
which could not have been foreseen from our previous knowledge of the fossils be-
longing to the British mountain limestone, which contained only 22 species common
to North Devon, and made the conclusion of some distinguished geologists as to the
separation of the Devonian system from the mountain limestone, perfectly legitimate,

even as regarded the northern portion of the district. Mr. Griffith observed, that this
comparison between the mountain limestone and the Devonian fossils had been con-
fined to those of North Devon. By a similar comparison with South Devon, the re-
sults were essentially different, inasmuch as out of 257 species of fossils obtained from

that district, only 94, or 36 per cent., were common to the mountain limestone of

Ireland, and 26, or nearly 1 1 per cent., to that of Great Britain, a result which led
to the conclusion, that the fossils of South Devon generally belonged to a different,
and, judging from the type of the fossils, to a more ancient period than those of North
Devon, though possibly a portion adjoining the culm series might eventually be found
to correspond with the period of North Devon. The fossils of North Devon were
given in these tables as described by Mr. Sowerby, Mr. L,onsdale and Mr. Phillips, and
those of the mountain limestone of Great Britain, by Mr. Sowerby and Mr. Phillips.
In regard to the fossils of the mountain limestone of Ireland, nearly the whole of the
fossils named in the table had been obtained by, and were in the collection of, the
author; of the 568 species which it contained, 166 were supposed to be new by Mr.
M'Coy of Dublin, who had examined and named them. Mr. Griffith stated, that the
collection also contained upwards of 100 additional new species, which were under
examination, including several species of Entomostraca, from the calp of Bundoran,
in the county of Donegal, the lower limestone at Armagh, and the carboniferous slate
at Howth, in the county of Dublin; numerous remains of fossil fish had also been
collected, but they had not yet been sufficiently examined to be named and intro-
duced in the catalogue. Mr. Griffith observed, in conclusion, that these investiga-
tions must still be considered as in their infancy ; the collection from the upper lime-
stone was particularly deficient, which had arisen from the circumstance of the di-
strict containing the best development of that member of the series being situated near
the summits of elevated crags, where no quarries had been opened ; and every geo-
logist was aware of the difficulty of collecting a good suite of fossils under such
circumstances.

Notice on the distinction between the Striated Surface of Rocks and Parallel

   Undulations dependent on Original Structure. By R. I. Murchison,

   Pres. G.S.

   The President called attention to an interesting notice just published in the Scots-
man newspaper and sent to him by the author, Mr. MacLaren, "On the Striated
--54 REPORT 1842.

Rocks of the Corstorphine Hills near Edinburgh ;" his object in so doing being to
urge geologists to distinguish well between appearances caused by mechanical action
and those resulting from structure- The existence of abraded surfaces of rocks in
these hills was (he stated) pointed out long ago by the celebrated Sir James Hall,
but when they were inspected by himself in 1840, in company with Mr. MacLaren
and Dr. Buckland, the surfaces which he then saw were marked by sets of wavy
parallel grooves or undulations (precisely similar to the casts sent formerly to the

Museum of the Geological Society of London), which appeared to him to belong to
a class of phasnomena distinct from the striated surfaces so common around Edin-
burgh and in many parts of Scotland. This opinion was confirmed by discovering in

the newly quarried body of the same rock of the Corstorphine Hills and at various
levels, undulations and grooves precisely similar to those on the surface, which were
thus shown to have been superinduced by original structure, an opinion which he
(Mr. M.) expressed upon the spot, and which he has published in his last Anniversary
Discourse. This view is indeed accepted by Mr. MacLaren, but that author at the
same time goes on to show, that on recent examination Sir G. Mackenzie and him-
self observed that the surface of parts of the Corstorphine Hills were also marked by
the small striae or irregular parallel scorings directed from west to east, and which
they believe must have resulted from powerful abrading agency, whether gravel and
water, glaciers or bottoms of icebergs.

   In thanking Mr. MacLaren for again calling attention to a subject he had so well
illustrated (see MacLaren's ' Sketch of the Glacial Theory'), the President said, that
he was quite ready to agree in all that had been written by that author in reference
to the Corstorphine Hills ; for although he had not seen the rough striae in his hurried
visit to that spot, he was well acquainted with such markings in many other parts of
Scotland, in which country, as well as in Sweden and Russia, he had endeavoured to
account for their presence by the grating action of the bottom of floating icebergs. It
was from this conviction (1840) that he opposed the terrestrial glacial theory of
Agassiz, as applied by that naturalist and Dr. Buckland to the low countries of Scot-
land, over which they contended that glaciers had advanced, which had scored all the

rocks, and which, on melting, had left moraines of gravel and sand. He was there-

fore happy to perceive, that in rendering justice to the merits of Sir J. Hall, Mr.
MacLaren had adopted the opinion for which he (Mr. Murchison) originally con-
tended; viz. that whilst icebergs very probably produced striated surfaces, the wavy
undulations are unequivocally due to the original structure of the rock*.

On the Strati/led and Unstratified Volcanic Products of the West of England.
                       By the Rev. D. Williams, F.G.S.

   This communication was supplementary to that which Mr. Williams made last year
at Plymouth. Subsequent investigation, on a far more extended scale, had confirmed
him in the results he then announced, viz. that granite, gneiss, mica-schist, porphyry,
greenstone, tufaceous ash, breccia, grit, chloritic, talcose, and clay slate, were all vol-
canic products, and that no such distinction as the so-called " plutonic rocks" really

--existed in nature they were, in short, associated together by evidences of their com-

mon origin, and connected together by a series of mutual dependencies, and as such

were capable of definite classification, as erupted products, as rocks in situ, which
have been fused, semi-fused, or had been in some other particular stage of fusion.
and as rocks simply altered by contact with ejected burning lavas. His object was
to reduce the entire family of ancient volcanic products within the scope of recog-

nized laws, and the ordinary operations of nature. He pointed to a diagram he had

constructed, of an ideal volcanic centre in a phasis of activity, which (by admitting
modifications to a greater or less amount) he submitted might serve as an illustration
of the process of fusion and conversion (so far as the rocks of the earth had been

submitted to our view) throughout all regions and all times. He supposed an in-

ternal nucleus of white incandescent lava, whose outer border was surrounded by a
zone of gneiss, the zone of gneiss by an outer concentric zone of mica-schist, and the
mica-schist by any sedimentary strata, as the case might be; under certain circum-

   * Mr. Bowman has since (Phil. Mag. Nov. 1841) shown that some structural appearances

in the rocks of N. Wales might be mistaken for the result of glacial action.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  55

 stances, he contended that these strata, and the inner concentric 2ones of mica-schist
and gneiss would be invaded by ramifying and anastomosing veins emanating from
the internal fluid, to an extent proportionate to the temperature; these veins (the
result of the intense heat which formerly traversed and melted down the walls of the
joints, and radiated thence laterally among the laminae of deposition), instead of
being passively injected among the bounding sedimentary or igneous rocks, were the
active instruments which fused and converted those rocks into trap, porphyry, or
granite, as the case may be ; these veins would thus convert the zone of gneiss into
incandescent lava, the mica-schist into gneiss, and a proportionate thickness of the
sedimentary strata into mica-schist; and if the vis a tergo of heat should be main-
tained, such transformations would progressively advance till the superincumbent or
outermost strata being reduced to their point of least resistance, they would neces-
sarily yield to the pressure or expansive force of the augmenting volume of the liquid
matter, and present all the phsenomena of a crater of elevation. From the whole
amount of his observations, taken round the granite of Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor,
&c, he considered that if Von Buch had not proposed the theory of "Elevation Cra-
ters," geologists would eventually have been constrained to have recourse to some
hypothesis of the kind to explain the appearances presented by those granitic domes.
With regard to the origin of the schist and slate rocks, a series of specimens might
be gathered from many localities in South Devon and Cornwall which would show
an insensible transition from the coarser volcanic grits and breccias into the finest
clay slate, every variety of which he had traced up to those more typical products.
Mr. Williams stated, that his inquiries had resulted in the conviction that granite,
gneiss, mica-schist, clay slate, &c. are no evidence of age or position in the geological
scale, but that they appertain to all formations, from the most ancient to the most
recent ; he considered gneiss and mica-schist were not simply " metamorphic " rocks,
but rocks in a particular or definite stage of fusion. The term " metamorphic" was
perfectly true so far as it went, but did not convey the entire sense which the facts

and circumstances of this class of rocks so manifestly conveyed. He therefore sug-

gested that they should be termed intermediate products, and granite, porphyry, trap,
breccia, grit, ash, chloritic, talcose, and clay slate, immediate products of volcanic

action.

On some peculiar Inorganic Formations and Fossils of the Magnesian Lime-

      ByOn the Occurrence of Boulders in the Valley of the Calder.

                                     John Travis Clay.

   In consequence of the information given by Lieut. William Alexander of Halifax,
at one of the meetings of the West Riding Geological Society, that in prosecuting
the works of the Manchester and Leeds Railway some pieces of granite had been
found at Hebden Bridge, the author proceeded to investigate the formation of the
alluvial deposits in the valley, and the result of the examination proved that boulders
of granite and other hard rocks exist in considerable abundance along a distance of
many miles.

   " The valley of the Calder along its whole course is bounded on both sides by
abrupt hills, which enclose a narrow and almost always level tract of land. The
hills are of the regular coal strata, and as far as I have been able to discover, are de-
stitute of a single boulder or even rounded pebble. The level portion, on the con-
trary, is entirely composed of removed matter, near the surface sand, clay and small
pebbles; but at about the depth of five feet there is a bed of boulders of a much
larger size, the majority of which are from the neighbouring rocks, but also contain-
ing many of granite, and others of similar origin.

width, yet extending continuously in nearly an east and west direction for many
miles : I have traced it from Hebden Bridge, near Halifax, to Wakefield, a distance
of upwards of twenty miles, and I have no doubt that it extends further east till it
unites with the great mass of drift which occupies the vale of York."

   The author supposes that at the period when the drift was deposited, the eleva-
tion of the land was much lower, which would cause the level parts of the country
to be submerged, and the narrow dales of Yorkshire would be sea-locks, like those
now existing in Scotland, along which icebergs detached from the glaciers of the
Cumbrian mountains would be floated in every direction.

Notice of the Fossil Footsteps in the New Red Sandstone Quarry at Lymm,
                       in C/ieshire. By Mr. Hawks haw.

  The Lymm quarry is at a short distance from Lymm on its eastern side, and south of

the turnpike road from that place to Altrincham. The general dip of the strata is
S.S.W. at an inclination of three inches to the yard. The quarry is near the out-
crop of the stratified beds that are worked therein. The nature of these beds will
be understood by the measurement of their vertical section as exposed in the quarry,
which is as follows :

Grass.

        soil.

vegetable life. The upper strata of sandstone, as the section explains, are gray ; they
become variegated with red as they descend, and it is only the bottom beds of the
quarry that have the dark red colour so common to this formation.

   The fossil footsceps have been found on nearly all the beds of sandstones; on the
uppermost small pointed impressions as if from Crustacea, and others resembling the
feet of birds. Impressions of Cheirotherium are on the upper strata also, but they
are of small dimensions, increasing in magnitude as the beds descend. Referring to
the several specimens from this quarry in possession of the Warrington Natural Hi-
story Society, and now in their museum, we notice a gray sandstone slab on which
are footsteps of Cheirotherium, chiefly varying from |ths of an inch to 1^ inch long,
the largest impression being 4 inches in length. The next, a slab of the same colour,
has impressions 3 inches in length. Another gray sandstone slab has impressions 4
inches in length. And upon a slab of dark red sandstone is one impression 10 inches
long, but of peculiar form, as though the foot that made it had been furnished with

claws.

   The most remarkable specimens of Cheirotherium from this quarry that I have
seen, are in the possession of Mr. John Robson, surgeon, of Warrington. Both are of
the deep red sandstone of the lower bed. The largest specimen, a slab of about 20
inches diameter, has two footsteps in the usual position in which they are when left
by the same animal, viz. the smaller preceding the larger footstep, which is 9^ inches
in length. The other specimen is a footstep of 7i inches long, on a slab of similar

 sandstone.
    Both these beautiful specimens are from impressions that appear to have been left

upon a thin stratum of the finest clay, which was so well prepared to receive the mould
as to leave a cast so delicate as to give us the texture of the skin that covered the
 sole of the foot. This appears to have been covered with small papillae, about 100
 to the square inch in the larger specimen, and about 220 to the square inch in the
 smaller specimen ; showing that the sole of the foot was furnished with a rough skin,
 such as might have been expected in a creature that walked upon a sandy shore.

         Notice of Perforations in Limestone. By Dr. Buckland.

   Dr. Buckland laid on the table a slab of limestone from Plymouth, perforated with
deep, irregularly rounded holes, which he attributed to the long-continued action of
the slime of garden snails {Helix aspersa), and stated that he found litmus paper to
exhibit a red tint if these snails are made to crawl over it. The feeble action of a
small quantity of acid in their slime, continued on the same parts of the same stone
during a long series of years, seems to afford an adequate cause for those effects, which
were last year adduced at Plymouth as the work of marine animals, and as affording

evidence of a raised beach. On visiting the spot, Dr. Buckland found the slab now

exhibited, with several living snails, and also shells of dead snails in the holes. In
September 1841, he found similar holes, with shells of a smaller wood snail in them,
on the under surface of blocks of limestone in Cumberland, and Mr. Baker has re-
cently observed them in the limestone of Cannington Park, near Bridgewater.

On Recent and Fossil Semi-circular Cavities caused by air-bubbles on the

Bysurface of soft clay, and resembling impressions of rain-drops.  Dr.

Buckland.

   In July 1840, Dr. Buckland first noticed cavities of this kind upon the surface of
some desiccated mud, which had been laid in small heaps by the side of the rail-
road near Reading; they were mostly of the size of holes impressed by large rain-
drops, but could not be referred to rain, because they existed only on certain spots
lower than the general surface of the heaps. The origin of these holes appeared to
have been the rise of bubbles of air through the bottom of little partial shallow
ponds of water on the mud, the general surface of which, from its convex form, had

allowed no water to rest upon it. A slab of new red sandstone on the table, from

near Birmingham, containing a few impressions of vegetables, was covered with small
tubercles in close contact with one another, and apparently caused by the deposition
                 --;

 of sand in holes formed by the rise of bubbles of air from a subjacent bed of clay.
 Dr. Buckland suggested that some of the cavities, and casts of cavities, on beds of
 sandstone at Storton Hill, near Liverpool, and also near Shrewsbury, which have
 been attributed to rain-drops, may have been due to the extrication of air-bubbles
 care would therefore be necessary to distinguish between these two causes of phee-
nomena, which have hitherto been exclusively attributed to rain.

 On lite Discovery of Lnsects in the Lower Beds of Lias of Gloucestershire.
                             By the Rev. P. B. Brodie.

    Such fossils being comparatively of great variety, and with one exception not ha-
ving been before discovered in the lias, the author was unwilling to delay any notice
of the occurrence of these organic remains in the lowest member of our oolitic series.
His former discovery of insects in the Wealden led him to a closer investigation of the
strata in the neighbourhood of Cheltenham, and the result has proved highly satisfac-

tory. He has already detected elytra of one or more genera of Coleoptera, one or
two minute beetles, and a few wings of some insects, one of which resembles that of
the Libellula. The above fossils are generally of small size ; the largest elytron is a
little more than half an inch long, and the largest wing about an inch in length ; nor

are they by any means abundant.
   The beds in which they occur consist of thin courses of blue, green and white

limestone, forming some of the lower beds of the lias formation, so extensively deve-
loped in the neighbourhood of Cheltenham and Gloucester.

On tlie Structure and Mode of Formation of Glaciers. By James Stark,

                                             M.D., F.R.S.E.

    Dr. Stark presented his views on the stratified structures occurring in glaciers under
the following heads :

  --1. On the Occurrence and Mode of Formation of Horizontal Strata: Most writers

seem to be agreed that these horizontal layers mark the additions which had been
annually made to the glacier, each layer being the accumulated snows which fell
during one year. Dr. Stark however showed, from a reference to the meteorological
tables kept at the Hospice of the Great St. Bernard, that considerable doubts might
be entertained as to this being the case. These layers of ice are in general from 1 foot
to 3 feet in thickness, but the tables demonstrate that from 300 to 700 inches of
snow fall during the six winter months alone, i. e. from October to March inclusive.
Dr. Stark therefore thought it was quite possible that each horizontal layer denoted
the separate storms or falls of snow, or if they marked the annual accumulations,
apparently proved, what had not previously been suspected, that snow and ice waste
nearly as rapidly in the upper as in the lower regions.

 --2. On the Occurrence and Mode of Formation of Longitudinal and Vertical Strata.

Respecting the structure to which he referred the lamellar, banded, striated or rib-
boned structure, mentioned by different observers, Dr. Stark offered the following

--explanation : Late researches show that glaciers advance at the rate of from 200 to

500 or 600 feet annually, and as it is generally allowed that this takes place only
during the spring and summer months, the daily progression of the glacier must be
from 1^ to 3 feet. This daily movement extends more or less to the whole extent
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  59

of the glacier; and as, in all the upper regions at least, the icy mass progresses from nar-
rower to broader valleys, every movement has the effect of leaving a narrow space
between the margin of the glacier and its containing walls. The granular snow which
covers the flanks of the valleys, being loosened and softened during the heat of the
day, slips down and fills these spaces, when the descent of the temperature during
the night, and the contact with the already formed icy mass consolidates it into a layer
of solid ice. Layers of ice in this position are recognized to be always more or less
granular, but to be divided from each other by plates of purer and more compact ice.
Dr. Stark regarded these plates as a superadded structure, occasioned by the trickling
of the water of the melted ice or snow over the external surface of each layer where
they were in contact, or nearly so, with the containing rocky walls. The water
would freeze as it trickled over the icy surface, and form a plate of pure and trans-
parent ice very different from the recognized structure of ice formed from granular
snow. From these longitudinal and vertical layers varying in thickness from a frac-
tion of an inch to several inches, Dr. Stark regarded their formation as a matter of
daily occurrence, the thicker layers being either produced by the spaces not having
been filled up for several days, or from the glacier having advanced more one day

than it did another.

 --3. On the Combination of Horizontal with Longitudinal and Vertical Strata. It was

remarked that in this combination the- horizontal layers would always be found to
occupy the middle of the glacier, whilst the longitudinal and vertical strata would

compose its breadth. No writer known to Dr. Stark described such a combination

of strata as occurring in any glacier $ but it was mentioned that a careful examina-
tion of the recorded observations of different authors who described the same glacier,

showed that such a combination must exist. Dr. Stark stated that the only possible
mode of explaining the apparently discordant statements of authors relative to the
position of the strata in glaciers, was to suppose that as the mass composed of hori-
zontal strata advanced onwards, it received in the manner above indicated a lateral
increase of longitudinal and vertical strata, which, at the same time they increased
its breadth, probably also added to its depth, by running for a greater or lesser ex-
tent below the already formed icy mass. It was shown that so long as the glacier re-
mained in the upper regions, it probably received additional horizontal layers from
the snows of each year or each storm, which would cover both the already formed

horizontal and longitudinal layers. When the glacier however descended so far as

to waste away from its upper surface, the horizontal layers from lying uppermost,
would first disappear, so that by the time it arrived at the level of the first line or so,
only a narrow band of horizontal layers might occupy the middle of the glacier, or
the whole might have completely disappeared, leaving the longitudinal alone appa-
rent. The ascertained difference of depth between the glacier in the upper and
lower valleys seemed of itself to prove, in Dr. Stark's opinion, that such must be the
way in which the horizontal layers disappeared, as all agree in stating that the
depth of the icy mass in the upper valleys is three or four times greater than in the
lower ones; and as none allow that in these elevated situations they melt away
from their lower surface, they must become thinner by wasting away at their upper

 surface.

    4. On the Appearance of Longitudinal and Vertical Stratification in Layers depo-

 sited horizontally.

  --5. On the Occurrence and Mode of Formation of Transverse more or less inclined

Strata. As the most remarkable and best-known point where this peculiar structure
exists, and where it is seen forming, Dr. Stark instanced the terminal portion of the
Rhone glacier, after it falls into the valley of the Rhone over the rocky barrier or

precipice which separates that valley from the Gallenstock. He stated, that at the
 central point on which the icy cataract falls no structure was visible, but that at some

 distance from this an appearance of layers running transversely began to be mani-
 fested, and that a series of transverse layers could be traced from this spot to the
 very termination of the glacier, each layer lying at a lesser angle or dip as that

 termination was approached. The lowest or terminal layer was mentioned to lie

 at an angle or dip of from 10° to 15°, whilst every layer above that lay at a
 higher and higher angle, rising even to an angle of 70°, as the central heap was

 approached.
--GO REPORT 1842.

 --Dr Stark offered the following explanation : As each mass of ice tumbled over

the rocky precipice it was dashed into a thousand pieces, in fact, resolved into the
irregular crystalline particles of which it was composed. The melting of ihe surface,
&c. saturates this granular mass with water, and so soon as any portion of it gets be-
yond the disturbing influence of the falling masses, the low temperature of the ice,
combined perhaps with the pressure of the overlying loose material, tends to solidify
a portion, and thus forms a new layer. As the fall of the ice over the precipice is not
a continuous but an interrupted process, each layer has time to acquire a certain
amount of thickness and solidity, before another mass, by the concussion it occasions,
disturbs the process, and by its additional weight causes the whole mass to move
forwards. Dr. Stark thought that the depth and distance to which the concussion
reached, and the weight of the overlying materials, would cause the layers to form
at a dip of 70°. Every layer was therefore formed originally at this angle or dip, and
parallel to each other; but as they advanced forwards in consequence of the success-
ive falls of ice, and the formation of new layers behind them, they were seen to lose
their parallelism to each other, and lie at lower and lower angles at every step of ad-
vancement towards the termination of the glacier.

    Dr. Stark accounted for this by showing, that the melting of the base, which was
necessarily greater at the termination of the glacier than where the layers were first
formed, gave the whole mass a tendency to fall forwards from the want of the sup-
port before and below, a tendency which was increased by the greater amount of
friction at the base of the layers retarding the motion of that portion, whilst the
forward motion aided still further their falling forwards, as there was no friction
on the upper surface to oppose the retardation of the friction at their base. The
plastic nature of the whole mass, and the transversely stratified structure, he
thought would allow of this change of parallelism and of dip being accomplished
with facility.

   Dr. Stark, in conclusion, remarked, that a glacier may, and probably in most cases
does exhibit during its course all the chief forms of stratification described above. At

its origin in the upper valleys the strata are horizontal. A little lower down the

horizontal strata occupy only the middle portions of the glacier, whilst the longitu-
dinal and vertical compose its breadth. Still lower down the vertical layers are alone
apparent; and at the lower extremity of the glacier, if the original structure has
been broken up and destroyed from any cause, the transverse stratification is alone
apparent.

On the Discovery of the Remains of Fishes at the base of the Mountain Lime-
    stone in the vicinity of Bristol. By the Bet: D. Williams, B.G.S.

   The author stated, that having recently discovered remains of mountain-lime fish
in a thin conglomerate which mineralogically appeared to belong to the old red
sandstone, be was induced to inquire what other evidences existed of a passage
between these two formations ; in this respect he found them singularly deficient
compared with the neutral beds and common alternations he had been accustomed
to meet with in Devon and Cornwall, between any two consecutive divisions, of
which a notable instance existed between the floriferous and carbonaceous series and
the overlying killas : near Bristol, however, it was all a hard junction ; the mountain
limestone and old red sandstone were there in juxta-location, but the links and
ties which determine gradation and uninterrupted succession elsewhere, were all

wanting.

   The mode adopted by Mr. Williams of ascertaining the genera and species of the

fish, as least liable to error, was by first comparing such palates as he possessed, with
all the care he could, with the plates of Agassiz, and having identified them satis-
factorily, he referred to the text for the formation and locality, which in every case
gave mountain limestone in either England or Ireland. This process of determination
gave the following genera and species, viz. Cochliodus contortus, Helodus simplex,
Psammodus turgidus, P. cinclus, and P. reticulatus.

   On the south bank of the Avon (below the red breccia which contained the Ich-
--

thyolites so abundantly on the north side) he observed a coarse red conglomerate

about twelve feet thick, which, with the thin one containing the fish, and the inter-

mediate grits, he considered as the true representatives of the conglomerate de-

scribed by Mr. Murchison as extending from Monmouthshire into Pembrokeshire

along the base line of the carboniferous limestone, and sometimes attaining a thick-

ness of two hundred feet. On the evidence of this Bristol conglomerate and the

fish remains, Mr. Williams referred all above it to the early period of the mountain

limestone, and thus placed it in strict parallel with the alternations of limestone and

red sandstone delineated by Professor Phillips in four sectional columns in his work

on Yorkshire, as resting on the great conglomerate, in as many widely-remote locali-

ties. His views necessarily required or implied an original elevation above the sea

level, and a subsequent submergence of the old red sandstone to a great depth below

it; and this admitted, the red sandstone alternations of Mr. Phillips and the case of

the St. Vincent's Rocks are referable to detrital matter abraded from the slowly and

unequally submerging old red sandstone at the first formation of the mountain lime-

stone. From the constancy of this conglomerate so interposed between the old red

sandstone and carboniferous limestone,  W.Mr.  inferred that it chronicled an inter-

val in time sufficiently capacious for the reception of the so-called Devonian system,

(for that vast succession of mineral masses incompletely developed in the West of

England, by terminating upwards with the killas group,) whose true place in the geo-

logical scale was intermediate between the old red sandstone and mountain lime-

stone, and (except on their respective confines) perfectly independent of either.

                           ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY.

On the different Species of Cotton Plants, and of the Culture of Cotton in
  India. By Professor Royle, M.D. F.R.S., of the East India House,
   and of King's College, London.

   The author observed, first, that plants yielding true cotton were natives both of the

Old and of the New World, that the species (all referred to the genus Gossypium by

--botanists) were distinct. India, for instance, produced two species, 1, G. arboreum,

or tree cotton, nurma of the natives, with red flowers, little cultivated, though yielding
a fine silky cotton ; 2, G. herbaceum, the herbaceous or common Indian cotton, of
which there were several varieties, including the Dacca cotton. This species has been
spread from India to the south of Europe. Both these species have small seeds with
short adhering hairs under the cotton. There are also two distinct American spe-
cies : 3, G. Peruvianum, or acuminatum, distinguished by its large black seeds, which
adhere to each other, and by its pointed fruit and leaves : this species yields the
Brazil, Pernambuco, Bahia, &c. cottons. 4, G. Barbadense, is so called from having
been early cultivated in Barbadoes. It has black Seeds, free of short hairs, and is the
same as the Sea Island cotton, and was long since introduced into the Islands of
Mauritius and Bourbon. From an examination of specimens and coloured drawings
this species appeared to be identical with the short staple or Georgian cotton, which is
remarkable for its large seeds being covered with short hairs or fuzz in addition to the

cotton. This is also the character of the New Orleans cotton which is said to have

been obtained from Mexican seed ; and this would appear to be the native country of
this species. If the fact were not supported by satisfactory evidence, it would be
difficult to believe that cultivation combined with change of soil and climate could
so completely alter the nature of the seed, at the same time that the staple became
both longer and finer. There maybe other species of Gossypium in Africa and China,
but we are without sufficient evidence on the subject, and the above appear to yield
 all the commercial cottons.

    Dr. Royle then proceeded to observe that these cottons were produced in a great
 variety of countries, from the line to 40° of north latitude, in very different soils, with
 great diversity of climate and almost every variation in the mode of culture, and also
62 REPORT-- 1842.

that some were sold for double and treble the price of others. The Indian cottons
were stated to be usually low in price from inferiority in length of staple and de-
fective cleaning ; but that they had some useful properties, such as a good colour,
taking dyes easily, and swelling in the process of bleaching, by which the cloth looked
more substantial. This property the weavers of Dacca objected to as unsuited to their
" webs of woven air," and therefore preferred the cotton grown near their town. Dr.
R. inquired whether this variety grown in a moist soil and climate might be less dis-
posed to absorb moisture than cotton grown in the drier soil and climate of the north-
western provinces of India, which having the property of swelling, was esteemed by

the weavers of Benares as well as by those of Manchester. Dr. Royle then contrasted
the culture in America with that in India, and found that they differed in every re-
spect; the American being more of the nature of garden culture, that is, where each

plant was individually attended to, in the processes of ploughing, hoeing, weeding,
heaping earth round it, and sometimes in pruning, besides great attention in picking,
drying, and cleaning the cotton from its seeds ; in all which the Indian processes dif-
fered in being exactly the reverse. In the American method, the spreading of the
roots in the soil, the exposure of the leaves to the air, and the due influence on both
of the stimuli of heat and light in a soil and climate not too dry nor over moist, were
all well calculated to restrain the inordinate growth of leaves, and to favour the due

production and perfection of flowers and fruit, and necessarily of cotton. There was

nothing, however, in the culture, soil, or climate that could not be imitated in India,

though it might no doubt require modification in degree from differences of soil and

climate.

   It would be remarkable if attempts had not been made to improve the culture of
cotton in India. In fact the Directors of the East India Company called the attention
of their government in India to this subject as early as 1788. They sent out seeds,
instructions, machines, and even an American, Mr. Metcalf, to teach the use of these,

and established farms for the improved culture of cotton in 1811, 1818, and lastly in

1829. These are usually stated to have been failures. This the Professor denied, as

good cotton had been produced and the culture was considered profitable, and only

required planters to take it up on their own account. The American cotton is also

said to degenerate in India. This also he considered incorrect. The Bourbon cotton,

which   is  the  same  kind  as  the  Sea  Island,  had  been  introduced  into  Tinnevelly,  in    1°

                                                                                                  1

of north latitude, and Mr. Hughes continued to send it to the Liverpool market for a

series of years of good quality, and always obtained for it a higher price than any other

cotton from India ever sold for. It has fallen off of late, but it has lost Mr. Hughes's
skill, which was displayed in the growing of senna as well as in the culture of
cotton ; Hughes's Tinnevelly senna selling for three and four shillings a pound, when
the best Alexandrian senna does not bring more tlian one shilling and sixpence. The
imports of Bourbon cotton from the Tinnevelly district have however increased in
quantity, as the natives have taken up the culture. That all the cotton introduced into

India has not deteriorated, is also proved by Mr. Elphinstone, Collector of Rutna-
gherry, and Dr. Burn at Kaira having produced cotton which has been pronounced

nearly, if not quite equal to the best New Orleans, and some not much inferior to Sea

Island, both from what appears to be acclimated Bourbon seed. Dr. Burn, in 18o8,
collected his seed from hedges where Dr. Gilders had made his experiments in 1817.
Without careful culture cotton will deteriorate in America quite as readily as in

India.

    Notwithstanding these repeated experiments and apparent failures, the Court of

Directors of the East India Company determined upon making another great experi-
ment, which should be sufficiently complete to set the question at rest. As is well
known in Manchester, Captain Bayles was deputed to and brought with him ten ex-
perienced planters of cotton, of whom three were sent to the Madras, three to the
Bombay, and four to the Bengal Presidency, taking with them American seed, ploughs
and hoes, gins and machines for cleaning cotton, and presses for packing it in a state
fit for transmission to market. The results of their experiments in the first year

Dr. Royle then proceeded to relate, chiefly from letters addressed to himseU, and the
proceedings of the Agricultural Society of India. The Bombay experiment, he was

sorry to say, had been a failure ; but, in fact, it had not received a fair trial, and for

the causes he referred to a letter lately published by the Hon. W. Baring to Mr. M.
                                                                                             ;

            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                    63

Gibson. He added, however, that the planters confined their experiment to the

black soil produced by disintegrated trap rocks of the Broach district, which only in

appearance resembles the black alluvial soil of Louisiana, and which, though agree-

ing well with the Indian, has in all the former experiments been found unsuitable to

the American cottons. This is related in all the printed accounts of these experi-

ments. But even in the present experiment, some American seed sown in a garden

which differed in having the common sandy soil of the district, produced good cotton

plentifully. The experiment has been ordered to be resumed by a planter from

Bengal and another from Madras.

The planters destined for Bengal were detained in this country, and visited Man-

chester and Liverpool, where they had seen various brokers, spinners, and manu-

facturers, from whom they received much valuable information respecting the kind

of cotton, and quality best suited for the different manufactures. They did not, how-

ever, reach their destination until March of last year, and had little time for choosing

eligible sites and getting settled in their farms, as sowing usually commences in the

middle of June, after the rains have set in. This year they did not begin until the

20th of July, and lasted only six weeks instead of three months, as usual ; they were

besides supplied with an insufficient number of large bullocks, the small ones of the

country being unfitted for the American plough ; but still, with all these disad-

vantages, the experiment may be considered decidedly successful, inasmuch as

though the quantity of cotton is small, the quality is good, and it is well cleaned

and one of the planters considers that the culture will be decidedly profitable, as cotton

can be produced cheaper than in any other part of the world. But the most im-

portant result obtained, was, that the American cotton continued to produce blos-

soms, bolls and cotton long after the Indian cotton cultivated by the natives had dried

up. Also, the Indian cotton cultivated in the American method assumed quite a dif-

ferent appearance, as, instead of growing like a straight stick, it threw out lateral

branches, which were covered with flower-buds, and continued, like the American,

to bear cotton long after all the same kind of cotton grown by the natives had com-

pletely withered up. These points were confirmed by letters from Capt. Bayles,

Messrs. Mercer and Finnie, two of the American planters ; also by the report of Mr.
Lowther, the Revenue Commissioner, who had visited the farms for the purpose of

inspection. Mr. Mercer is well pleased with the soil and the people, who readily

dryness of the climate, and he has had a very trying season in that respect. The great

canal which has been sanctioned by the Court of Directors to be made through the

centre of the Doab, and which is to be 500 miles in length, and will afford water for

irrigating five miles on both sides, as it will render famine impossible, so will it make

the cultivation of cotton easy and independent of dry seasons.

ing and extremely important to find that a like result has attended those undertaken

in the Madras Presidency in the district of Coimbatore, in about 12° of N. latitude.

The planters were first sent to the Tinnevelly district, and afterwards removed to

their present localities near Ernaud and Coimbatore ; so that in this way some time

was unfortunately lost. Their experiments were made both with the New Orleans

and with the native seed, in both the black and the red soil, the latter the result of

disintegrated granitic rocks.

The season here seems to have been at first untoward, apparently from the great

dryness of the weather, as the accounts which were received by the January mail

stated that the experiment had not succeeded in the way that had been anticipated,

probably either from unsuitableness of soil or season, in reference to the times of

sowing and the modes of culture. Dr. Wight, however, the present superintendent,

saw enough to be convinced that the American method, with some modifications, was

sure to succeed, and he was ready to rent land for the purpose of establishing

this culture. That he was not too sanguine was evident by his subsequent letters,

all which gave more encouraging prospects. In that dated 17th April, 1842, he

was enabled to say that he considered the experiment to have completely succeeded,

as the plants had thrown out fresh leaves and flowers, and that the bolls had set,

ripened, and produced good cotton ; so that from fields which they thought had

ceased to bear, they obtained no less than 15,000 lbs. of seed cotton, and were still

collecting cotton. He concludes his letter by saying that next year, if the season is

but moderately favourable, they will be enabled to send nearly if not quite J 000
bales of American cotton.

    The Professor concluded his paper by stating, that from the results of some of the
former, as well as from many of those of the present experiments,- and from the
modifications in culture, which would be made to suit the several situations, he had
no doubt that, by the acclimation of the American cottons in some localities, and by
the improvement of the native cottons in others, good cotton, that is, such as is re-
quired for many of the Manchester manufacturers, would be produced with profit in
India. In fact, the principal question remaining to be determined, was the quantity
of cotton which would be produced per acre by adopting or modifying the American
method of culture, so as to make them perfectly suitable to India.

    The paper was illustrated by drawings of the several species described ; the different
kinds of seed, as well as with specimens of cotton grown by the American planters
in all the three Presidencies, which were all well cleaned by the American gins sent
out by the Court of Directors, and made by Mr. Laird, Liverpool, and with which
the planters seem generally well satisfied, as well as with the ploughs and hoes.

   The cottons produced were pronounced well cleaned and of good quality by some

of the Manchester gentlemen present, and the New Orleans cotton grown in the red
soil of Coimbatore, as good as any New Orleans cotton received from America, and

that it would be a most useful cotton and much consumed in Manchester.

    Mr. Bazley exhibited specimens of cotton and living cotton plants.

   Mr. Dew'oain exhibited the downy fruit jjf the Black Poplar. It was the produce
of a tree that had not hitherto borne fruit, and he had heard of several trees having
this year produced fruit in like manner.

          On the Promotion of Vegetable Groioth. By G. W. Hall.

   Mr. Hall showed the importance of the subject, not only to the general resources of

the country, but in its direct relation to the scientific objects of the Section. He traced

the several causes of vegetable growth, and enumerated the elementary constituents
needed for that object ; showing the progressive changes through which the simple
elements were carried by the several processes of fermentation and combustion on
organic vegetable matter. The products of each of these processes of dissolution
he claimed as the essential elements for promoting the growth of vegetation, arguing
that that which had already been produced by vegetation, could again be applied, by
the processes above described, to the same purpose, after separation into its original
constituent parts. Founded upon this principle, he then described the mode adopted
by Mr. Daniell of Tiverton, in taking advantage of this principle in the laws of vege-
tation, and by an application of the sources of fermentation and combustion to the
soil, under circumstances of minute mechanical subdivision, and in a state fitted for
solubility, to promote the fertility of the country, and the growth of the most useful
and most needed plants. The long-continued experiments under which this had been
accomplished were detailed to the Section, showing that the result was highly fa-
vourable ; while, on the other hand, it was argued, step by step, from the nature of
the elementary substances required, and the capability of these being afforded in the
required way, that the philosophical reasons for such success were as simple and ob-
vious as the facts were plain.

  On Liebigs Theory of Fallow Crops. By the Rev. J. B. Reade, M.A.,

                                                   F.R.S.

   The fallow time, as Liebig observes, is that period of culture during which land is
exposed to a progressive disintegration by means of the influence of the atmosphere,
for the purpose of rendering a certain quantity of alkalies capable of being appro-
priated by plants. Careful tillage increases and accelerates this disintegration, and

Nowsecures from time to time a new supply of soluble alkalies.     Liebig states that,

for the purpose of agriculture, it is quite indifferent whether the land be covered

with weeds, or with a plant which does not abstract the potash inclosed in it. Accord-

ingly, he would alternate with corn crops, which extract the alkalies of the soil, the

usual fallow plants in the family of the Leguminosce, because, " being remarkable on

account of the small quantity of alkalies or salts in general which they contain,"

they neither extract alkalies from the soil, nor do they exercise any injurious influ-

ence on the corn which is cultivated after them. The farmer is hereby greatly ad-

vantaged in being able thus to steal, as it were, an intermediate crop from his land,
inasmuch as an entire absence of plants appropriating these unimportant quantities
of salts would of necessity compel him to the constant repetition of bare fallows, in

order that the soil, during an interval of rest, might regain its original fertility.
Such is the theory. The fact, however, most unquestionably is this, that the plants in
the family of the Leguminosa usually cultivated as fallow crops, so far from acting

but slightly on the saline constituents of the soil, are remarkable, above all others,

for the large quantities of soluble salts contained in them.

The experiments by which this result may be arrived at are very simple. If two

pounds of bean straw, and of clover hay, be submitted to the action of fire and allowed

to burn till they cease to give any flame, they will yield  about  two ounces of  ashes
                                                                                                    ;

and distilled water (about two pints) being poured upon the hot ashes, and repeatedly

filtered, after squeezing it from the insoluble residuum, is charged with the soluble
matter which, to a certain extent, is set at liberty by the process of combustion. The

quantity of soluble matter, chiefly potash, contained in the clover saline solution,

appears, upon evaporation, to be about ninety grains, and in the bean saline solution
about forty grains ; whereas by a similar Operation upon the ashes of wheat, barley,
and oat straw, the soluble saline matter does not amount to thirty grains. The pre-
sence of potash may be detected in these tolutions not only by the well-known smell
peculiar to Liquor potassa, but also by the characteristic crystalline precipitate on
the addition of bichloride of platinum, by the copious insoluble bitartrate cf potash
on adding the solutions to tartaric acid in excess, and by the salts of potash formed

with mineral acids.

   The saline solution from bean straw is also remarkable for containing lime in solu-
tion, and hence, probably, we have one important cause of the streugth of bean straw

manure. In twenty-four hours after the clear bean solution is obtained, a crystalline

precipitate of carbonate of lime is attached to the sides of a stoppered bottle, and, in

the course of a few days, it considerably increases in quantity.
   All the solutions, when evaporated to about half an ounce, exhibit a remarkable

precipitate, which, upon being separated and washed, ceases to be soluble in water,
and the action of acids and alkalies, as well as of the blowpipe upon this sub-
stance, is accompanied with phsenomena which deserve the attention of agricultural

chemists.

   The condition of carbon in these solutions ought also to be accurately exa-

mined.

   The author concludes with the following question : may it not be the case, that the
leaves which fall so abundantly from these plants, and the roots which remain in the
ground being so copiously supplied with saline matter from the presence of potash in

every cell, do really furnish more soluble alkalies by the subsequent process of tillage,
than the soil, especially when of a sandy nature, could in any other way obtain for

the future production of corn ?

   Mr. E. Solly, jun. exhibited specimens of the diseased bark of living ash trees,
occasioned by insects.

The aloe began to throw up its flower-stem in May 1841. The first blossoms

opened about the end of July, and it went on flowering till October.

distorted.

 On the Nidus and Growth of the Purpura lapillu3, and also on the Patella
                     pellucida and P. laevis. By C. W. Peach.

    Ellis in his 'Essay on the British Corallines,' says that the "Sea Cup" is the ovary
 of the Periwinkle shell-fish ; but from a series of observations made by Mr. Peach,
 commencing in January of the present year nnd eontinued up to Monday the 20th
 of June, it appears that the " Sea Cup" belongs not to Turbo littoreus, but Pur-

 pura lapilhcs. Mr. Peach had seen the Purpura lapillus employed in the formation
 of these interesting fabrics, and on pulling these shells from the rock on which they
 were fixed, he found that they enveloped three or four of these cups with their man-
 tles and that there were indentations in the mantle answering to the number of cups
 that it had covered. These "Sea Cups" are firmly attached to the rocks, and when left
 by the whelks the mouth is securely sealed up, and they are then of a pale yellowish
 colour : after some time the internal part assumes a granular appearance, and is of a
  pinkish hue ; the young fry leave their habitation at the end of about four months,
  and take refuge in the crevices and shelter afforded by the sea-weeds and shells at-
 tached to the rocks. The author exhibited a series of specimens in all their various
  stages of growth, with some of the nidi, and amongst them some young shells which
  had been reared in his house from the nidi kept in a dish of salt-water, and which had
  all the peculiarities of the adult, such as canal, striae, and propensity of remaining for
  considerable periods out of the water on the side of the dish ; leaving no doubt that
  they were the Purpura lapillus.

     The author also stated that, from a series of observations and examination of thou-
  sands of specimens in all their various stages of growth, he does not hesitate to say
  that the Patella lesvis is the young of the Patella pellucida. The P. Utvis is first found
  on the leaves of the larger sea- weeds ; after a short time it descends to the stem, and
   as it increases in age lower and lower; and before reaching the lowest part it scoops
   out a small cavity, and on arriving at age and strength it cuts a road through the
   roots of the sea-weed and takes possession of its final abode in a cup which it forms
  at the foot of the weed, and is there suspended apex downwards. The author has
   never found it attached to the rocks, like the P. vulgata, P. virginea, &c.

      The transition may be traced from youth to age, and all the beautiful blue ray3 ob-

   served with all the characteristic appearance.

      He also exhibited several other shells which had been taken from the corks and
   ropes used by the crab-catchers on the coast of Cornwall, to show the rapidity of

   their growth : also specimens of the Anatifera fascicularis and A. lavis on feathers,
   cork, coal and wood cinders, straws, wood, the shell of the cuttle-fish, &c. &c, the
   whole from the Cornish coast.

       Mr. Peach exhibited some undescribed species of Cornish zoophyta.

             On the Palpi of Spiders. By John Blackwall, F.L.S.

       As arachnologists do not appear to have bestowed that degree of attention on the
    palpi of spiders°to which their greatly diversified structure and remarkable functions
   undoubtedly entitle them, a few observations relative to this interesting subject may
    not perhaps be wholly devoid of utility.
--

    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  67

   Many spiders employ their palpi in assisting to collect into a small heap the slack
line which results from their operations when engaged in ascending or drawing in

such silken filaments as are attached to objects distinct from themselves by one ex-

tremity only.
    In conjunction with the mandibles, the palpi are employed by females of the species

Dolomedes mirabilis and Dolomedes fimbriatus to retain their cocoons under the sternum,
in which situation those spiders usually carry them wherever they move ; the Lycosce-
also avail themselves of the same parts in regaining possession of their cocoons when
detached from the spinners.

    Various species belonging to the genus Salticus, to which distinctness and ac-
curacy of vision are of the utmost consequence, as they do not construct snares, but
capture their prey by springing suddenly upon it from a distance, have the terminal
joint of the palpi abundantly supplied with hairs, and constantly make use of those
organs as brushes to remove dust, or any other extraneous matter, from the corneous

coat of the anterior eyes.

   The palpi appear to afford direct assistance likewise to spiders in general in se-
curing their prey, in changing its position while they are feeding upon it, and in re-
straining the action of the wings of all their victims which happen to be provided
with them.

   At the meeting of the Association held at Cambridge, the author communicated to
the Section of Zoology and Botany the results of experiments having for their object
the determination of the function performed by the remarkable organs connected with
the. terminal joint of the palpi of male spiders *.

    Since that period he has greatly extended and varied his researches in connexion
with this subject, and it affords him satisfaction to state, that they promise, when
complete, to divest the matter of all uncertainty whatever; indeed, from the decisive
character of the evidence at present in his possession, he does not hesitate to assert
positively that the palpal organs, whose full development indicates a state of ma-
turity, are the only instruments employed by male spiders in the propagation of their

species.

   The several joints of the palpi of female spiders differ greatly in their relative pro-
portions, not only in species constituting the same family, but even in those belong-
ing to the same genus ; while, on the other hand, it frequently happens that females
belonging to different genera bear a striking resemblance to each other in this

particular.

   It is among male spiders, however, that these peculiarities are the most marked,
and to them may be added structural differences and resemblances both of the palpi
and palpal organs still more conspicuous.

   A great similarity in the form of the palpal organs and in the manner in which they

are connected with the digital joint of the palpi may be observed in certain spiders of
the family Dysderidee ; in Dysdera erythrina, Dysdera Hombergii, Segestria perfida,
Segestria senoculata, and Oonops pulcher, for example; and this similitude is extended

to various species belonging to the family Mygatidce.
    Between Manduculus ambiguus and Tetraguatha externa there is a near approxi-

mation in the structure of the palpi and palpal organs, yet these spiders are not in-
cluded in the same family, the former belonging to the Theridiidce and the latter to

the Epeiridce.

    If we compare the spiders constituting the genus Clubiona with those of the genus
Drassus, and those of the genus Linyphia with the species comprised in the genus
Neriene ; or, extending the investigation still further, if we compare together the
genera JValckenaera, Theridion, Epe'ira, Eresus, Salticus, Thomisus, and Philodromus,
numerous instances of correspondence in the relative proportions of the joints of the
palpi will be perceived immediately, at the same time striking contrasts will present

themselves to the eye of the observer, not as regards proportion alone, but organiza-

tion also, even among nearly allied species.
    From these facts the following practical results appear to be fairly dedu-

cible :

    As the full development of the palpal organs indicates a state of maturity in male
spiders, the skilful arachnologist is enabled, by attending to this circumstance, not

                                               * See Report for 1833, p. 444.

only to distinguish adult males from females, but likewise from immature individuals
of both sexes. This knowledge is useful in preventing him from falling into the too
common error of mistaking young spiders for old ones, and of describing them, and
the sexes of spiders of the same kind, as distinct species.

   When any doubts exist respecting the specific identity of spiders of different
sexes, which have been regarded as belonging to the same species, they frequently may

be set at rest by placing the spiders together in captivity and noticing whether they
pair or not.

   The great diversity of structure observable in the palpi and palpal organs of male
spiders supplies excellent specific characters, and indeed frequently presents the
only available means of distinguishing species of similar colours and dimensions from
each other; but when we consider that this diversity of structure extends to spiders

connected by the closest relations of affinity, it is perhaps in vain to expect that it will

ever be applied with much success to the establishment of genera.

Account of a Species of Ichneumon, whose Larva is jxirasitic on Spiders.

                          By John Blackwall, F.L.S.

    Immature spiders of the species Epe'ira autriada and Epe'ira cucurbltina, and adults
of the species Linyphia minuta and Linyphia pusilla, are frequently infested by the
larva of a small Ichneumon, which feeds upon their juices and ultimately occasions their
de;\th. This parasite is always attached to the upper part of the abdomen, near its
union with the cephalothorax, generally in a transverse but occasionally in a longi-
tudinal direction, and, though it proves a source of constant irritation, is secured by
its position from every attempt of the spider to displace it. Being apodous, it ap-
pears to retain its hold upon its victim solely by the instrumentality of the mouth
and of a viscid secretion emitted from its caudal extremity. More than one larva is
never seen on the same spider, which, indeed, could not supply sufficient nourish,-
ment for two.

    In the earlier stages of its growth this parasite has an oblong oviform figure,
somewhat depressed on the under side ; it is whitish with a faint tinge of yellow ex-
tending along the medial line, which seems to be occasioned by the contents of the
viscera. At this period of its existence the external covering presents a smooth
uniform surface ; but when it has completed its moultings and attained its full size,
the head becomes visible, the body exhibits thirteen distinct segments, and the pre-
vailing hue is pale greenish yellow.

   When about to assume the pupa state, it kills the spider which has supplied it

with sustenance by rapidly exhausting its physical energies, and quitting it con-
structs on some adjacent object a cocoon of a quadrilateral figure tapering to its ex-
tremities, which is composed of pale yellowish white silk of a compact texture.
After the lapse of a month nearly, the perfect Ichneumon issues from the cocoon, and
prepares to carry on the work of destruction assigned to its species ; a preliminary
step towards which is the deposition of her eggs by the female on the bodies of her
victims, care being taken that one only is attached to the same spider.

   It is a fact deserving of notice, that immature spiders infested with the larva of
this Ichneumon do not change their skins. Were it not for this admimble provision
of Providence, the larva, cast off with the integuments in the act of moulting, would
inevitably perish, and the important purpose which its remarkable economy is so evi-
dently intended to subserve, namely, the keeping of these deadly enemies of the in-
sect tribes within due limits, would fail to be accomplished.

   The author described minutely the characters of the female and male Ichneumon,
which he conjectures may be unknown to entomologists.

   Mr. Turner exhibited specimens of Goliathus regius and Goliuthus giganteus.

   Dr. Lankester drew attention to a microscopic animal that had been found the
day previous in the Botanic Garden, covering the stems of the Chara flexilis, and
giving them a loose gelatinous white appearance. The moment they were touched
this character disappeared, from some contractile power possessed by the animal.

Mr. Aider had examined the animal alluded to, and found it to be a very large spe-
cies of Vorticella, which he had never before seen. The bell-shaped summits of the
animal were visible to the naked eye.

          Notices of Eolis, Doris, £$c. By Joshua Alder, F.L.S.

   Mr. Alder of Newcastle read a description of three new species of Mollusca, of
the genus Eolis, lately found by Mr. Albany Hancock on the coast of Northumber-
land ; and also exhibited drawings by that gentleman of these, as well as of some other
new species of Nudibranchia, descriptions of which had appeared in the 'Annals of Na-
tural History.' Mr. Alder took the opportunity of stating that Mr. Hancock and he
were still pursuing their examination of the British species of this order, and had
lately had a further opportunity of confirming the fact of the existence of eyes in the
genus Doris, having found a young specimen of the Doris depressa in which the
eyes were very distinct. He stated that they had made some examinations with the
microscope of the elegant appendage in Melibcea, Tritonia and Eolis, which are
usually considered to be branchiae. They found that in Melibwa ornata vibratory

cilia existed all over the body, but in a less degree in the supposed branchiae than
in other parts, and that an individual deprived of these appendages lived for several
days afterward without apparent diminution of activity; thus proving that these
were at least not the only means of respiration that the animal possessed.

   Mi\ Moore exhibited the head of a Grayling, showing its pear-shaped iris; also
specimens of Argulus foliaceus and other parasites. The specimens of Argulus folia-
ceus were from the ponds of the Botanic Garden at Manchester, where they attacked
the common carp, but not the gold or silver carp.

On a Specimen of Macheerium subducens from Port Essington, New Hol-

   land, belonging to the Collection made by Mr. Gilbert, Mr, Gould's As-

  sistant By Dr. Richardson.

   This fish, except in the teeth, has a strong external resemblance to the Echiodon
Drummondii, lately discovered by William Thompson, Esq. in the Irish seas. Its
dorsal and anal, which are well developed, are united to the caudal, but the rays of
the latter are more slender, rather shorter and more crowded, so the difference is
readily recognized by the eye. The first ray of the dorsal and anal is simple and
flexible, all the rest are branched at the tips. The pectorals are small, and there
are no ventrals. The body is much compressed, and its resemblance to the blade
of a short sword or butcher's knife is the origin of the generic term'*. The teeth,
small and subcorneal, stand in a single series on the intermaxillaries and lower jaw.
The palate and vomer are toothless. The orifice of the mouth is moderately large

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the maxillary, though sufficiently conspicuous, forms no part of its margin. The
pedicles of the intermaxillaries run back over the orbit and permit the upper jaw to
be considerably protruded. The lower jaw is articulated far back, the cheek is large
and scaly, the opercular pieces smooth and very distinct, and the six branchiostegous
rays are very obvious and by no means short. The 'gill-openings are moderately
large. There are no barbels attached to the integument covering the os hyoides,
which is the character by which Mackoerium is most readily distinguished as the type
of a generic or sub-generic group, from Ophidium. Another character may be found
in the scales, which, though small, are regularly tiled, and not imbedded in the skin
in a scattered manner. The lateral line terminates before the anus, as in the Blen-
nies, to which this fish seems to bear considerable affinity. Mr. Ball has said the same
thing of Echiodon, though he afterwards ranged it with Ophidium, with which it is in
fact still more closely allied. It would be perhaps better to bring the Blennies and
Ophidia together. Agassiz has already separated the Blennies from the Gobies, and
placed them in the Gadoid family. The Anguilliform.es, or Apodes would evidently be
more natural were the Ophidia removed also to take their place near the Gadi. The
single character of the want of ventrals seems to be insufficient to keep them in sepa-

rate orders, and we have in fact in the jugular barbels of the typical Ophidia a near
approach to the single ventral rays of some of the Gadi. Machaerium and Echiodon
form links in the series terminated by the Fierasfers, which have the fins further
reduced so that the dorsal becomes a mere fold of the skin.

      Notice of Halcyon Smyrnensis. By H. E. Strickland, F.G.S.

   Mr. H. E. Strickland exhibited a specimen of Halcyon Smyrnensis (Linn.), transmit-
ted from Asia Minor by Mr. Edward Forbes. This species, described by Albin more
than a century ago, from a specimen procured at Smyrna by Consul Sherard, appears
not to have been subsequently noticed on the shores of the Mediterranean. The pre-
sent specimen is therefore of interest, both as verifying the general accuracy of
Albin's description, and because it is proved to be specifically identical with the Indian
bird figured in Buffbn's PI. Enl. 894, which some ornithologists have supposed to be

distinct.

Note of Species obtained by deep Dredging near Sana Island, off the Mull of

   Cantire. By George C. Hyndman, Member of the Natural History

    Society of Belfast.

   When cruising about with my friend Edmund Getty, Esq., in the Gannet yacht on

the 19th of July 1841, the following result was obtained by dredging at the depth of
forty fathoms, about two miles east of Sana Island. The bottom was shelly, with a
proportion of shell-sand. The region " coralline," according to Mr. Forbes's defini-
tion. Dredge down three times.

Results of deep Dredging off the Mull of Galloway. By Capt. Beechey,
     R.N. Drawn up by Wm. Thompson, V. P. N. H. Soc. of Belfast.

   Captain Beechey, the distinguished navigator, having in the month of April last
been engaged in a survey of part of the Scottish coast in H.M. steam-vessel Lucifer,
most kindly undertook to use the dredge in the deepest water in which his soundings
might be made, and the following are the highly interesting results obtained on three
occasions ; the products from the different depths being most carefully kept separate.

                            MEDICAL SCIENCE.

On the Construction and Application of Instruments used in Auscultation.
  By C. J. B. Williams, M.D., F.R.S., Professor ofMedicine in University

   College, London.

The acoustic examination of the chest having been so profoundly as well as gene-

rally studied, it is not surprising that the instruments used in it should have needed
modifications to make them exhibit better the phenomena which increased experience

and skill have discovered. To make these improvements, some knowledge of acou-

stic science is necessary ; and it might seem to be the province rather of the natural
philosopher than of the physician to suggest them. But it must be borne in mind,

that a good knowledge of the ends in view, as well as of the instrument, is required.

To suggest what a stethoscope ought to be, a knowledge of acoustics is not more

Anecessary than an acquaintance with disease and experience in its investigation.

mywant of these latter qualifications, in  opinion, renders some recent suggestions

of the Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh of little value to practical men.

An imperfect acquaintance with all the purposes and ends of the stethoscope seems

to me also apparent in other late proposals for its improvement.
   I now beg to offer a few remarks on the acoustic principle of the stethoscope, and

on the best mode of applying this principle to obtain an efficient and convenient in-

strument for auscultation.

   Laennec, the inventor, had no accurate views with regard to the principles of the

construction of the, stethoscope. He declared that the instruments which he found

to be the best Were not constructed according to the commonly received laws of

natural philosophy. Experiment taught him that the solid cylinder does not convey

the sound of the. breath or voice so well as the cylinder perforated or excavated at its

pectoral end. Many years ago I pointed out that this fact, which is unquestion-

able, is in perfect accordance with a law of acoustics, that sounds are best conducted

by bodies of an elasticity or tension resembling that of the sonorous body. On the

other hand, bodies differing in elasticity become bad recipients of each other's vibra-

tions. Thus wood, although an excellent conductor of sounds generated in itself or

in other solids, receives but imperfectly those produced in air. But by thinning wood,

and bringing a large surface in contact with air, it is more readily affected by the
vibrations of air, and becomes an excellent medium for transferring to air sounds of

denser solids ; and this is the principle of sounding-boards of musical instruments.

   * This species was dredged in Belfast Bay by the collectors attached to the Ordnance

Survey.

   t In June 1842, Mr. Hyndman dredged a full-grown Trochus papillosus near Sana

Island.

76 REPORT--1842.

The view which I have always given of the principle of the stethoscope, represents

its operation as varying with the source of sound ; that sounds produced in air
(vocal and breath sounds) are best transmitted by an enclosed column of air ; those
produced by solids (those of the heart, bronchi, friction) are better communicated by

rigid solids of moderate density. This view I still hold, and I proceed to show how
the principle may be brought into the best operation.

   I shall first point out the conditions by which the stethoscope may conduct aerial

sounds. It has been lately questioned, that the air contained in the central canal

and excavation in any degree assist in conducting sound. This doubt has arisen
chiefly from the observation first made by Dr. Cowan, that plugging the central
canal with cork or putty does not much impair the power of the instrument. Pro-

fessor Forbes has repeated the same remark.
   I have made many experiments on this point* and will now state some of the re-

sults. Corking the pectoral end of the instrument decidedly impairs its conducting

power, but stopping the ear-end does so in a much slighter degree. But in any way

stopping  the  tube  does  impair  the  passage  of  sound                               and, to be assured of this, it is
                                                                                      ;

necessary to try a test sound (as opticians use a test object), a sound just within the

bounds of audibility, such as the sound of expiration, or a very faint cardiac mur-

mur. But the impairing effect of such a stoppage is most obvious in the flexible

stethoscope, in which, if used near the pectoral end, a cork in great measure stops

the sound. That the stethoscope really conducts sound by its closed column of air,

--as well as by its solid walls, is further proved by the following facts : Loud pectoral

sounds, particularly of the heart and its murmurs, may be heard by bringing the ear

end close to the ear, without touching it ; the sound is then conveyed exclusively by
the air, and may be totally intercepted by a plug. If a hole be made in the side of a

stethoscope, its conducting power is greatly impaired, especially for aerial sound

and it is at once restored by closing the aperture with the finger. This depends not
only on the accession of extraneous sounds through the orifice, but chiefly on the

much lower power of conduction which an open column of air possesses.

The closed state of the column of air is the chief condition necessary to give air a

high conducting power. Following the assertions of acoustic writers, that the pulses

of sound pass through air in straight lines like rays of light, I formerly recommended
that the pectoral end of the stethoscope, instead of being made with a parabolic hol-

low as directed by Laennec, should open by a very tapering cone, and that the whole

interior should be made as smooth as possible to promote the most direct reflexion
of the waves of sound. But this principle is more applicable to ear-trumpets, which
receive sounds from the open air, than to the stethoscope, which receives vibrations
from a solid surface. Air confined in a close tube vibrates as a whole, and its vibra-

tions pass over angles and through the coils of a flexible tube with a facility which

supersedes the idea of straight reflexion ; and although they must be more freely
transmitted through a straight smooth tube than through a crooked and rugged one,

the difference is less than might be expected without a knowledge of the properties

of close tubes.

The chief object in the formation of the hollow part of the stethoscope is to bring

into closed contact with the walls of the chest a surface of air as large as possible,

and to convey the pulses of this air as directly as possible to the ear. It is at the

same time desirable to avoid a large hollow within the instrument, because such a

hollow causes a conchal or tinkling echo, from the repeated transverse reflexion of
the vibrations. For this reason the parabolic cavity is bad. The conical cavity is
much better, and for the aerial vibrations is perhaps the best ; but the trumpet or

bugle-end does not appear to be inferior, and answers better than the conical end for

transferring the vibrations of solids.

  We now proceed to consider the office of the solid walls of the stethoscope. I

have before noticed the inferiority of the solid stethoscope. Those who consider the

stethoscope to conduct only by its solid walls, ascribe this inferiority to the weight of

its mass, and suggest that, if its weight be reduced by hollowing, the simple solid is

still the best instrument. On this principle I had an instrument constructed, closed
at the pectoral end with a thin plate of wood, but it proved to be much inferior to

the open kind.
   But finding the considerable share which the solid walls have in communicating

the sounds, I have devised a form for the pectoral end of the instrument which qua-
                               ;

lifies it for this office better than any now inuse ; this is the bugle or trumpet-end,
the edges of which being made very thin, and fitting flat on the walls of the chest,
are most readily affected by their vibrations. The instrument thus constructed, if
tried with a test-sound, will be found for most purposes superior to those now inuse.

    But most stethoscopes are provided with a perforated stopper, the object of which
is to shut out diffused sounds, and transmit by the central canal the sound from a
spot only. I find that the same object can be pretty well attained with the new ste-
thoscope by reversing it, applying the ear-end, which is made of dense wood, to the
chest, and the hollow end to the ear ; and, from its flatness, this pectoral end fits
the ear very well, without hollow enough to give the conchal sound.

   An inconvenience early found in this instrument was its fragility in the pocket.

This was readily obviated, and a convenient portability obtained, by taking off the
ear-end and fitting it into the hollow" end, which is thus supported in its thin part.

                                                       Percussion.

    Since I explained the principle of percussion in 1835, I have had almost daily op-
portunities of proving its accuracy, and of deriving advantage from the varied modes
of percussion which a clear understanding of that principle suggested. So delicate
do I now find this test, that in many instances it discovers disease when other signs

are negative.

   The principle is briefly this, that the sound on percussion is derived from the
bodies which the impulse of the stroke reaches ; and the character of the sound de-
pends on the conjoint vibration of these bodies. Thus gentle and flat percussion
reaches, and is toned by, superficial parts only ; forcible percussion reaches, and is

toned by, deep-seated parts also.
   The character of the stroke-sound differs not only in loudness and clearness, but

also, and most remarkably, in pitch ; the deepest tones being the healthiest in all
cases except a few of pneumothorax and flaccid emphysema. In some instances the
stroke-sound is much louder on the diseased than on the healthy side. This is re-
markably the case where the sound is tubular, from condensation or compression of
the upper lobes of the lungs from pneumonia, pleurisy, or tubercle ; but in all these
cases the morbid character of the sound is proved by its note being higher than on

the healthy side.
   In percussion of the abdomen, different degrees of pressure with the pleximeter or

the hand struck on, will often afford useful results. The gentlest filliping percussion
without pressure may sometimes detect the superficial dulness of a layer of serum,
too thin to be discoverable by fluctuation : strong pressure, on the other hand, dis-
places the superficial parts, and brings the pleximeter within striking distance of the

deep-seated parts.
    For general purposes I consider the fingers the best instruments for percussion

and the various ways in which they may be used constitute one of their best recom-

mendations. There are, however, a few cases in which a little instrument for per-
cussion will give more accurate indications ; and I will mention one which is very
simple as well as efficient. Percussion plates generally are too large to be applied
closely between the ribs : when made of hard materials they cause too much clack-
ing on their own surface. The hammers recommended by Drs. Burne and Bennett

are liable to the objection, that their strokes may not fall in the same direction ; and
thus the sound may vary from the mode of the stroke.

   To obviate these objections, I have a firm narrow slip of whalebone slightly bent,
so that one end forms a handle, while the other is applied to the chest : this last is
covered with leather and velvet, to deaden the clack of the surface. The hammer is
made of a lenticular spheroid of lead, also covered with leather and velvet, with a
small rod of whalebone for its handle. The pleximeter fits like a finger between or
on the ribs : the hammer head being circular, can scarcely vary in the direction of its
stroke, and both being elastic as well as firm in their handles, they may be used with
much ease and precision.

    Observations on the Therapeutic Application of Air- Tight Fabrics.

of evaporation in water-dressing. This valuable addition to therapeutics was chiefly to
he ascribed to Dr. Macartney, who was really the first, and not the Germans, to point
out its utility, and to explain its pathological action ; but, independent of water-dress-
ing, oiled siik proved, simply by itself, of great value as a therapeutic agent, by pre-
serving parts to which it is applied from changes produced by the atmosphere, by pre-
venting evaporation, and thereby promoting perspiration and a return to healthy
action. This was found to he particularly the case in dry scaly affections of the skin,
which in mild cases its use completely removed, as in slight attacks of psoriasis, lepra,

and scaly affections of the scalp. He had also found it useful as a derivative, removing,
when worn on the head, obstinate chronic ophthalmia and protracted coryza. Its use

in water-dressing was well known, and extensively practised ; but he found it equally
valuable where it was necessary to use more active agents, metallic salts, in solution
for different purposes : these lotions it materially improved in cases of severe eczema

and prurigo.

   He had found another application of air-tight textures of great use, to assist the

operation of derivants or revulsives applied to the external surface. For this purpose
Mackintosh's India-rubber cloth answers best. Flannel or cotton cloths dipped in
hot water, when covered with a piece of this cloth, act as a poultice or fomentation,
and are very beneficial in slight inflammations of the chest or abdomen. By adding
salt, mustard, ammonia, turpentine, or various other stimulants to the water, a counter
irritant operation is added, which the superimposed air-tight cloth renders more equal

and durable than that resulting from any common counter irritant. Such applications
Dr. W. has found very serviceable in phthisis and other chronic affections of the

chest.

   A third therapeutic use of air-tight cloth was one invented and lately made with

sucoess by Dr. Arnott, as a means of applying equal pressure to parts : this was by
using a slack air-cushion or bladder containing a little air between tho bandage or
compress and the part to be pressed on. This interposed a layer of uir, which dif-
fused the pressure equally and softly.

On the Influence of the Coronary Circulation on the Heart's Action.

                           By J. E. Erichsen.

The influence of arterial blood on the voluntary muscles, the author stated, was ac-

knowledged by physiologists ; and surgeons were familiar with the fact, that when the
main artery of a limb, as the femoral or axillary, was tied, the contractility of the

muscles of the extremity was much impaired, and was not restored until the complete

Wereestablishment of the circulation.      ought then, a priori, to expect that a similar

influence would be exerted over the involuntary muscles, particularly over the heart.

Dr. Marshall Hall, in his Gulstonian Lectures, attributes sudden death frequently to

an interruption of the coronary circulation. From the importance of the subject, in

a pathological view, Mr. Erichsen undertook a series of experiments to demonstrate,

as far as possible, the influence of the coronary circulation on the heart's contractility.

These were numerous and varied. The coronary vessels were tied after killing the

animals, artificial respiration was kept up, and the time the heart, in its several parts,

continued to contract was accurately noted ; each experiment was detailed, and the

--following conclusions Mr. Erichsen deems fully established : First, that an arrest of

the coronary circulation produces a speedy, although by no means instantaneous, ces-

sation of the heart's action. Second, that an increase in the quantity of blood sent

into or retained in the muscular fibre of the heart, produces a corresponding increase

in the activity of the organ. The latter deduction was made from experiments in

which the aorta was tied, thus causing a greater quantity of blood than natural to be

forced into the coronary artery ; artificial respiration was not kept up ; the right ven-

tricle continued acting for a much longer time than it would do, under similar cir-

cumstances, when no ligature was applied to the aorta. In connexion with this ex-

--periment the following fact was observed : that the order of cessation of the different
--cavities of the heart was reversed. In it the order of cessation was as follows : First,

the left ventricle ;  second,  the  right  auricle                                 third, the left auricle ;  fourth, the right
                                                                                ;

ventricle. It has been established by Haller and subsequent physiologists, that the

On some Peculiarities in the Circulation of the Liver. By Alexander

                       Shaw, Surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital.

The object of this paper is to treat of the influence of the actions of respiration

upon the circulation of the blood in the liver. Former writers have shown that, during

the act of inspiration, the cavity of  the  pericardium undergoes a dilatation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        a dispo-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

sition for a vacuum to take place in the space around the heart, therefore, occurs at

that time; and the consequence is, that the blood in the venous trunks is drawn

with increased velocity to the right auricle. Sufficient attention, however, has

not been paid to the effect of this auxiliary power in promoting the free discharge

of blood from the hepatic veins, and thereby facilitating the circulation of the liver
generally. To prove that the blood is sent with increased velocity from this gland to

--the heart during the act of inspiration^ the author directs especial notice to three prin-

cipal points, first, to the place at which the venae cava? hepaticae join the inferior cava

secondly, to the structure of the hepatic veins; thirdly, to the mode in which the opening

in the tendon of the diaphragm through which these veins pass is enlarged orcontracted,

in correspondence with the motions of respiration. With regard to the first point, as

the hepatic veins join the cava inferior just where it has entered the cavity of the peri-

cardium, it follows that their mouths will be exposed directly to the influence of the

vacuum described as occurring at inspiration in that cavity ; secondly, as to the ana-

tomical characters of the venae cavae hepaticae, the peculiar structure of these veins

corresponds with the view that the blood is subject to be drawn out of them by the

force of suction. It is a law in physics, that for fluid to be propelled along a tube by

atmospheric pressure, it is a necessary condition that the tube communicating with

the cavity in which the vacuum takes place should be of a rigid structure, otherwise

its walls will become collapsed. The author first refers shortly to the mechanism

described by Sir Charles Bell*, as provided in the neck for protecting the veins in

that situation from the effects of the atmospheric pressure while the vacuum is form-

ing in the chest during inspiration, and then proceeds to point out that a provision

for the same object exists in the veins of the liver. He shows that, owing to these

veins being contained in canals, the boundaries of which consist of the firm substance

of the liver, and to the coats of the veins adhering closely to the interior of the canals,

whereby they are prevented from collapsing, they may l»e regarded as rigid tubes,
capable of resisting the atmospheric pressure. He considers, therefore, that when

there is a disposition for a vacuum to be formed in the cavity of the pericardium

during inspiration, and the liver is subjected to compression, the venae cava? hepaticae

are enabled, by this peculiarity of their structure, to maintain their calibres of the
natural size ; and the blood is consequently drawn, or pumped out of the depths of

the gland with accelerated velocity at that time f. Lastly, the author directs atten-
tion to the difference in the relative dimensions of the opening in the tendon of the

diaphragm, through which the hepatic veins pass, according as the muscular fibres of

the diaphragm are in a state  of contraction  or  of relaxation                                                          and he likewise points
                                                                                                                      ;

to the change in the direction of this opening, as compared with the orifices of the

veins of the liver, dependent on the shifting of the position of the parts in these two

conditions. During inspiration, not only is the opening in the diaphragm dilated,

owing to the tension of the tendon at that time, but, from the protrusion of the liver,
the veins are elongated, and their course made straighter and more favourable for the

escape of the blood ; whereas in expiration, the opening in the diaphragm is con-

tracted, owing to the relaxed and flaccid condition of the tendon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and from the change
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

of position of the liver, the course of the veins from the point where they emerge from

the gland to that where they pass through the diaphragm, is rendered oblique, or a

kind of valvular obstruction takes place between the two openings. By these means

it follows, that while the force of suction is in operation during inspiration, the chan-

nel for the transmission of the blood is both wide and direct ; but that during expi-
ration, when from the contraction of the chest there is danger of the blood regurgi-

tating from the heart into the open canals within the liver, their mouths are partially

closed.

On the Relation of the Season of Birth to the Mortality of Children under

  two years of Age, and on the probable duration of Life, as it is affected by

  the Month of Birth solely, and by the Months of Birth and Death con-

 jointly. By Mr. Catlow.

Mr. Catlow drew his inferences concerning the mortality of children from a table

of 10,700 deaths under two years of age,,from 1821-1 838, extracted from the registry
of the Rusholme Road Cemetery, in Manchester, whose natal month was determi-

nable from the stated age. Following the estimate of the average number of births in

each month by M. Quetelet, as an index to the debit number of deaths to be furnished

from the births of each month severally, the average result is, that the winter births,

or those of January, February, and March, supply 2-1 per cent, less than their debit

quota of the mortality ; and the autumnal births 2-7 per cent, less ; while, on the
other hand, the spring births supply 2-4 per cent., and the summer births 2*5 per cent,

more than their debit quota of the mortality. It thus appears that summer and spring

births have a less probability of arriving at the age of two years than winter and

autumnal births. If we estimate the relation to the debit quota of mortality half-

yearly, we find the general result to be a deficiency of 4 - 6 per cent, in the winter

quota, that is, for births in the rising part of the year, or winter and spring, and of

course a corresponding excess in the summer quota, that is, for births in the falling

Apart of the year.  second inference, then, appears to be, that children born in a

generally increasing temperature have a greater probability of life up to two years
than children born in a generally declining temperature. It may be inferred, thirdly,

that the season of birth is one of the necessary elements in the estimate of the causes

of infantile mortality in general, or at any particular period. From another table,

exhibiting the quota of mortality furnished by each month of birth, we learn the re-

markable fact, that the June and July births furnish the largest quota of mortality under

two years, while, according to M. Quetelet, they are less numerous than the births of

any other month. It was inferred by Mr. Catlow from these and other facts and tables

submitted, that the tendency to death in a certain month is as inherent in the animal

economy as is the tendency to a certain duration of life. Moreover, since death in

a certain month does not produce the same effect on the average duration pf life with

respect to every month of birth, but raises it in one case and depresses it in another,

it seems fair to infer the existence of a special and fixed relation between the anniver-

sary season of birth and that of death. Again, we may with reason consider that the

seasons of birth and death are equally characteristic elements in the constitution of

man, and are equally correlative with all his periodical changes. Nay, it is not diffi-

cult to foresee that the different combinations of these two constitutional elements

must be, on the one hand, promoted, and on the other hand prevented, by similar com-

binations in both parents.

           On the Uses of the Muscidar Fibres of the Bronchial Tubes.
                         By James Carson^mw., M.B.

   The object of this paper is to assign a use to the muscular fibres of the bronchial
tubes, whose existence was first pointed out by Russessen, but the really contractile
power of which was not established until it was made the subject of investigation by
Dr. Williams, whose report was laid before the British Association at the Glasgow meet-
ing. The author of the present paper maintained, in opposition to the previously-
received opinions on this subject, that the object of the muscular apparatus was to co-
operate with the external inspiratory muscles dilating the cavity of the chest, in
extending the superficies of the peculiarly organized membrane lining the air-vesicles,
at which surfaces the change produced in the blood by the air is effected. This they
effect by contracting during inspiration, and by thus determining in the air-cells or
vesicles an increase of dimensions at least equal to the whole increase of volume of
the chest arising from an inspiration. To illustrate the effect of this contraction of the
tubes on the superficies of the vesicles, the following calculations, based on the suppo-
sition that after an ordinary expiration there remain 100 cubic inches of air in the
vesicles, and that the average diameter of the air -vesicles is -r^th of an inch, were
submitted to the Section. There are 190,985,000 such vesicles in the lung.

On a general Law of vital Periodicity. By Thomas Laycock, M.D.,

     M.R.C.P., London, F.R.M.C.S., Physician to the York Dispensary.

The object of this paper is to establish, by induction, a law of periodicity, with a

term of seven days, pervading the entire animal kingdom, and influencing the mani-

festations of disease in man. The facts brought forward for this purpose are derived

from periods of gestation,  or   of hatching,  in fishes,     reptiles,                                 birds,       and   mammals
                                                                                                                                                                                ;

from the transformations and habits of insects ; from the effects of morbid poisons on

the animal economy, as more particularly exhibited in malarious, exanthematous, and

infectious fevers ; and from the phsenomena of gout and the mutations of chronic
diseases. In all of these classes of facts a periodical movement is found, with a strict
reference to seven days, or its submultiple or multiple. Of the numerous facts stated
the following are examples : of 129 species of birds and mammals, whose period of
utero-gestation or incubation was examined, in 67 the period was a definite number of

weeks or months. 24 were within one day of being so, and in the remaining 39 the
period was so loosely stated as not to be of much weight for or against the accuracy
of the measure of time adopted by the author. As special examples, it is stated that

the period of incubation in the Grallidse, Tetraonidse, and other birds of about the

same    size, is  three weeks ;  in   the   Anatidse  four  weeks                                       the    Cygnidse    six                                      weeks
                                                                                                     ;                                                                                  ;

but in small birds, as the Museiparse, only two weeks. The period of hatching in the

salmon is exactly twenty weeks; in the wasp, common bee, and ichneumon, half a

week, or seven lunar days; in other insects a week and a half, as in the Tenthredo

capr&a, or gooseberry gnat ; while in the mole-cricket it is four weeks, and in the

glow-worm six weeks. The author states, that the most remarkable confirmations of

--the law are to be found in insects by observing the periods regulating first, the de-

velopment of the ovum ; second, the duration of the larva state, and the moults which

take place in this stage of development; third, the duration of the pupa, or chrysalis

period and fourth, of the imago state, or puberty, and of the vital manifestations
                                    ;

then developed. Numerous examples from these conditions in many species are

given, in all which a period of seven days, or its simple multiple, is traced. The

phsenomena of disease in man are next examined in the order previously mentioned

and the author endeavours to show that the stages, the duration, and the principal

changes of the whole class of febrile diseases, are governed by the same law, which

really  afforded  the  grounds   for  the  establishment  of  the  critical                                    days  of  Hippocrates
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

of these days, the most important being the seventh, fourteenth, and twenty-first, and

the next in importance the fourth, seventh, and eleventh, the half-periods. The law-

is next traced through a paroxysm of gout, and through chronic diseases; and it is

observed that the doctrine of " septenaries," which prevailed among the ancient phy-

sicians, was founded on similar observations, by whom the fact of vital periodicity was

assumed, as if it were too well known to be doubted.

By extending this law to health and the performance of healthy functions, the

author shows how it    explains       some  hitherto  inexplicable                                      facts  in  pathology                                        as, for
                                                                                                                                                                 ;

example, the latent periods of fever, and the limitation of them to a period of twenty-

eight days. The extension of an epidemic amongst an entire population is also regu-

lated by it; and, according to the author's views, the individuals of a single family,

that is, of those born of a common mother, will be attacked at intervals of time regu-

lated by the measure he has developed in the general law. It is remarked that those

fevers, "one attack of which affords immunity from a second, exhibit invariably the

quartan type ; or, in other words, are measured by the half-period ; and that this

general fact must be considered of some importance in discussing the vexed question

of contagion. The inquiry into the efficacy of remedial agencies may be rendered

more satisfactory than it has been hitherto, by remembering that, by the operation of
this law, the return to health, as well as various functional changes, may be altogether
independent of any remedies whatever. In short, the author insists that the know-
ledge and observation of this law is necessary to carry on all pathological inquiries
with scientific accuracy.

   A further investigation of the law is recommended to naturalists, meteorologists,
veterinary surgeons, and medical practitioners. Upon the naturalist is impressed the

importance of accurately noting all vital changes or habits in animals which occupy a
limited portion of time. The vast field presented to the entomologist is mentioned.
The period also of moulting, in all animals, is instanced as worthy of notice, and so
also the time occupied by birds in pairing, nest-building, and egg-laying, as well as in
incubation. All observations, the author suggests, should be made with reference to
known meteorological phaenomena, so that the relations of the law may be ascertained
and its regulating cause detected. This, it is supposed, will be finally found in the
moon's motions round the earth, or in the combined movements of the earth and
moon. The time of the day at which periodic phenomena occur is in evident relation
with the diurnal variations of the barometer and of the electric tension of the at-
mosphere, as well as with the diurnal deviations of the magnetic needle. For example,

it is stated that the barometer is at its minimum variation when the fits of quotidian
and quartan agues begin, and at its maximum when they end. The silk-worm moth,
and the hawk-moth of the evening primrose, constantly break forth from the pupa
about the hour when the magnetic needle is at its minimum variation east, while the
hawk-moth of the lime appears when the needle is at its maximum variation west,
and the death's-head moth at the hour of minimum variation east. The paroxysms

of agues exhibit similar relations to the earth's magnetic state.

   The author remarks, that it is of much less importance to observe the moon's
changes in connexion with periodic vital phaenomena than to observe her apogee and
perigee, her equinoxes and solstices; in short, rather her relations to our planet than

to the sun. In accordance with these views, the author suggests the division of the
year into lunar seasons, of which he thinks there are six; or at least that the solar
seasons be more accurately defined, and according to meteorological phaenomena.

Of these, the intermediate point should be at the equinoxes and solstices, so that mid-
autumn would be about the 21st of September, mid-spring about the 21st of March,
&c. The author concludes his paper by remarking, that it is only widely-extended
and accurate observations of this kind which can form the foundation of a science of
vital proleptics ; a science the most important of all, as having for its object the pre-
vention or amelioration of social and individual suffering, by foretelling its occurrence
and foreseeing its causes.

   On the Period of Puberty in Negro Women. By John Roberton,

                                                        Manchester.

    The object of this paper is to prove, from a large body of well-ascertained facts ob-
tained from three of the Moravian Mission stations in the West Indies, that there is
no truth whatever in the common notion that the period of puberty is earlier in black
than in white women ; in a word, that the notion in question is no better than a vul-

gar error.

   The data concerning the period of puberty in negro women in the West Indies are
furnished by three independent witnesses ; two of them superintendents of Moravian

stations in Jamaica, and the third a medical gentleman long resident in the Island of
Antigua, employed by the Moravian superintendent in that island to conduct the in-
quiry. The result is a body of facts of an unexceptionable kind, consisting of tables
of the ages of a number of negresses, with the age when puberty occurred. As a
whole, the evidence goes to prove that negro females reach this period of life neither

earlier nor later than the women of Europe.
    N.B. The paper, in its entire form, will be found in the ' Edinburgh Medical and

Surgical Journal ' for July 1842.

   In consequence of Mr. Tyrrel's attention to her eyes and syringing her ears, she
can now get a glimpse of shining objects on the floor (a shilling), can sometimes

such exercises of the senses and constant communications by touch with two young

Cases of enormous Hydropic Distension of the Abdomen, and ofsudden Death

  from tlie Rupture of an Aneurism of the Thoracic Aorta. By Sir David

   J. H. Dickson, M.D., F.R.S.E., F.L.S.

   Mr. James Frazer, superannuated boatswain, aged 65, stated that he had been
affected with general dropsy for nearly two years, and that the disease had super-

vened on a severe attack of rheumatism. He had only returned from Jersey within
the previous week. He was received into the hospital on the 16th of April, at three

o'clock p.m., and died early next morning. Besides the great distress, dyspnoea and
cough, &c. resulting from the enormous distension of the abdomen, the lower extremi-
ties also were so loaded with serous effusion, that the integuments of the left leg
(which from the knee to the ankle were of a fiery-red colour, in some places very
dark and fast running into gangrene and sloughing) had given way, and thus some-
what relieved the turgescence of the limb by a very profuse discharge of serum.

   The following are the principal morbid appearances elucidated by dissection,

twenty-three hours after death :

   The abdomen contained fifty-nine imperial pints of very viscid straw-coloured
serum, which coagulated firmly on being heated. The visceral peritoneum was of a
deep red or livid colour, and much thickened; the intestinal canal was dilated. The
liver was about the natural size, but dense, indurated, and so much altered in shape
as to resemble a very large kidney. The spleen and kidneys were nearly normal.
The heart was considerably enlarged, and the pericardium was universally adherent
the left ventricle was hypertrophied, and the mitral valves were thickened and carti-
laginous, so as to narrow the corresponding aperture, reducing it to a transverse slit.
The lungs were congested and slightly cedematous. This is supposed to be the largest
accumulation on record.

    Mr. John Anderson, boatswain, aged 64, who had been admitted for obstinate con-
stipation a few days previously, and whom I had left sitting on his bed a few minutes
 before, suddenly becameffaint, fell back and expired.

    Sectio Cadaveris, twenty-four hours post-mortem.--The cavity of the right pleura
 was found to be almost filled with blood, which had separated into serum and cras-
 samentum ; the former amounted to three pints, and the coagulated portion, which
 was exceedingly firm, weighed about three pounds. The haemorrhage had proceeded
 from a large aneurism of the thoracic aorta, and the tumour, which resembled a cocoa-
 nut both in size and shape, corresponded to the three last dorsal and first lumbar

vertebrae, tbe bodies of which were carious and deeply eroded, while the intermediate
fibro-cartilages were, as usual, sound, and projected into the interior of the sac. The
oesophagus, which adhered closely to the anterior wall, was much flattened and thick-
ened. The sac contained a fibrinous coagulum, distinctly laminated at the circum-
ference, together with a quantity of semi-fluid blood in the centre. The orifice lead-
ing into tbe right pleura had a lacerated appearance and was situated close to the
spine, and capable of admitting tbe little finger. The left ventricle of the heart was
hypertrophied and its cavity diminished, but the valves were sound. The aorta was
generally dilated, the lining membrane thickened and puckered, and numerous cal-
careous deposits existed between it and the middle coat. The stomach, liver and
kidneys were natural, but the spleen was very small, and the intestines, especially the
colon, were much dilated.

Abstract of the Case of a Diver employed on the Wreck of the Royal George
   who was injured by the bursting of the Air-pipe of the Diving Apparatus.

  By John Richardson, M.D., F.R.S., §c, Inspector of Hospitals at

   Haslar.

In tbe operations that have been carried on at Spithead for two years past, for the

removal of the wreck of the Royal George, under tbe superintendence of General

Pasley, the divers are clothed in a water-tight caoutchouc dress. The legs of tbe dress

are of one piece with tbe body and end in close feet, like stockings; the arms are

open at the wrists to admit of the passage and free use of the divers' hands, but are

rendered air-tight there also, by the application of bandages. The diver enters the

dress at the neck, which is then gathered into folds and closely secured to a brass

collar, on to which the capacious helmet that incloses the head is screwed. This

helmet is furnished with a window of thick glass in front of the eyes, a valve behind

to permit the escape of air, and an aperture near tbe crown through which, by the in-

tervention of a flexible tube of a length proportionable to the depth of water, atmo-

spheric air is propelled by a forcing-pump. An external coarse canvas frock pro-

tects the dress from injury, and thick woollen shirts and trowsers, worn next the skin,

suffice for warmth. The shoes are heavily loaded with lead, and weighty plates of

the same metal are hung over the shoulders and tied to the back and breast. The last

act  of the  diver's  toilet  generally  consists  in the  screwing  on  of the  glass  window                                       the
                                                                                                                                  ;

forcing-pump instantly begins to play, the dress is distended by the air, balloon fashion,

and the diver, having a signal or safety-line tied to his waist, passes over the

ship's side, and descends leisurely into the sea by a rope ladder which reaches to

the bottom. There he remains working on the wreck from half an hour to an hour

and a half or more at one time. The forcing-pump, which is fitted with three pistons,

is worked by double cranks manned by four labourers, and throws in a constant

stream of air from the time that the helmet is closed before the diver descends until

it is opened after his ascent. The heat generated in the air-pump by friction is abs-

tracted by a stream of water which flows round the chambers, and the air is thus

--kept cool. The gauge, which stands at 15 under the pressure of one atmosphere, ge-

nerally marks 34 when the diver is below about equal to two atmospheres and a

quarter. The dress loses its balloon shape and is pressed pretty closely to the limbs

before the diver reaches the bottom. The helmet weighs 17^-lbs., the leaden

weights 80lbs., and the whole dress, these included, 130lbs. ; but the weight is not felt

as an incumbrance at the proper depth, which in the operations is from 13 to 15

fathoms, according to the time of the tide. The diver generally takes about a minute

and a half to ascend from the bottom, but can be drawn up in somewhat less than a

minute when an alarm of danger is given. Six divers are constantly employed ; they

perform their work with much cheerfulness and alacrity, and they are very seldom

known to suffer any inconvenience. Some persons, however, who have attempted to

descend so dressed, always bleed at tbe nose and spit blood after they reach the bottom.

  On the 14th of October 1841, Roderick Cameron, a private in tbe Royal Engineers,

a well-made, tall, active and intelligent man, who had been trained for some time

as a diver, descended to the bottom in 13 fathoms, and in a few minutes afterwards

the air-pipe burst close to the pump. The air escaping with a loud rushing noise,

which was heard at the distance of 50 fathoms, instantly made the accident known,

and the workmen commenced immediately to haul the man to the surface by the
     TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                            85

safety-line, the air-pump being kept in action all the time. Cameron himself imagines

that he became aware of the accident sooner than those upon deck, and he had time

to make the signal of danger before he felt that they were pulling him up. His

first sensation was that of suffocation, from a want of air, and he felt the collar

of the helmet, the leads on the back and breast and the dress on the body generally

pressing upon him, as if he were about to be crushed, after which he lost all per-

ception. It is supposed that he was brought to the surface in less than a minute, and

air was immediately admitted into the helmet by unscrewing the eye-piece. No water

had entered within the caoutchouc dress. In less than a quarter of an hour he reco-

vered his consciousness and was soon afterwards able to speak. He was immediately
removed to Haslar Hospital, three miles distant from the scene of the accident. When

first examined at Spithead, the face, neck and breast were discoloured, and the tint

became darker before he reached the hospital. When he arrived there, his face

was  considerably swollen,  his  neck  more  so               both had a dark purple hue, and large
                                                           ;

patches of extravasated blood separated the conjunctiva from the sclerotica of both

eyes. He felt no uneasiness in the chest or head, but had much pain in the larynx,

and considerable difficulty in swallowing. P. 65, rather full. Leeches were applied

to the throat, and he was placed in a warm hip-bath.
   He passed a comfortable night ; next day he felt giddy, the pupils were dilated,

the eyes were pained by light, and objects were seen double, though his vision was

less hazy than on the preceding evening. The pain in the larynx and difficulty of

swallowing were almost gone, the swelling of the face and neck had greatly subsided,

and parts of the face were resuming their natural hue. The conjunctiva of both eyes

was punctured, and the more fluid portion of the extravasated blood allowed to escape.

The discoloration of the face and neck went entirely off in a few days, with the ex-

ception of the upper and under eyelids, which retained their dark purple tints for

above a week, and the blood extravasated beneath the conjunctiva was not absorbed

for a month. The natural vision was restored on the fourth day from the accident,

and after that time till his discharge from the hospital he had no uneasy sensations.

He was anxious to return at once to his duty as a diver, but was not permitted to do

so again that season. The principal question of interest excited by this case is, repect-

ing the cause of the crushing sensation experienced by the diver, and the extensive

discoloration of the chest, neck and face. As the air must be propelled into the

helmet with a force superior to the pressure of the water at any given depth to which

the diver may descend, it appears obvious that the bursting of the pipe must have
produced a sudden diminution of pressure. An accident of a similar nature occurred

in the operations carried on by Captain Dickenson for the recovery of treasure from

the Thetis, wrecked off Cape Rio. Two men were employed in the diving-bell, in 15

fathoms of very clear water, when the air-pipe burst. They both dived under the edge

of the bell, and one of them, named Haynes, reached the surface in from 11" to 15",

but perceiving that his companion, named George Davies, lingered below, he dived

again and assisted him up. This was witnessed by John Leary, armourer, who was

also present at the operations of the Royal George, and, in his opinion, Davies was

more swelled about the neck, and blacker from the waist upwards than Cameron *.

             On a Case of unusual Paralysis. By Dr. Carson.

    I have taken the opportunity of the meeting of the British Association to lay be-
fore the Medical Section a case of peculiar partial paralysis, which occurred at the

Northern Hospital of Liverpool, in the practice of my friend Mr. Banner, and which
he kindly afforded me an opportunity of observing, with permission to present it to

the meeting. The patient, Mark Barnes, aged 23, has all his life enjoyed good health,

   * Since the meeting of the Association an accident of a precisely similar nature to Came-
ron's has occurred to another of the divers employed on the Royal George, named John
Williams. The discoloration of the face and neck was of a darker purple than in Came-
ron's case, but did not extend to the hairy scalp ; his eyes were much blood-shot, the neck
swelled, and blood flowed from his nose, mouth and ears. This case has been published in
detail by Dr. Liddell, Deputy Inspector of Hospitals at Haslar. Subsequent to the occur-
rence of the last accident a valve has been fitted to the termination of the air-pipe, by which,
in the event of the tube again bursting, the air will be retained in the helmet, to serve for
respiration while the diver is ascending to the surface.
--86 REPORT 1842.

with the exception of the inconvenience arising from the paralysis, which was not
preceded by, nor is it accompanied with, any pain in the head or spine, nor any diseased
sensations in the skin or extremities indicative of cerebral or central nervous lesion by

which the paralysis might be explained. He is a joiner by trade, and about ten years

ago he first experienced a loss of power in the right arm and an inability to bring into
exercise all its movements. The principal inconvenience arose from the difficulty,
amounting to inability, of raising the arm above the head to more than a right angle
with the body. The loss of power gradually increased, and at the end of twelve
months the base of the scapula on the right side was noticed to stand out from the back,
and at the expiration of three years it assumed its present appearance. At the same
time from the commencement of the attack the right lower extremity began to fail
him, his gait becoming rather unsteady, and when in the bent position he experienced
a little difficulty in raising himself. About four years ago, being six from the com-
mencement of the attack, the arm of the left side became similarly affected, the
 scapula being displaced and the lower extremity being affected as on the right side,
although he has retained more power in the left arm than in the right. The cir-
 cumstance which more prominently strikes the attention in the present case, is the
appearance of the scapula?, more especially when the man attempts to raise and make
 use of the arm. In the quiescent position, the base of this bone, instead of lying par-
 allel to the spine, is approximated to it at the lower angle, and stands out from the
 ribs a distance of an inch and a half, leaving between the scapula a deep hollow
channel, the upper angle being drawn high up into the neck, appearing on both sides
to the observer in front midway between the shoulder and ear. The clavicle in front
 is in ite natural position, as is also the acromion process of the scapula to which it is

articulated. The acromion process stands considerably forward. When the patient
 attempts to raise the arms all these appearances are much exaggerated. The base of

 the scapula approaches nearly to a right angle with the spine, forming with the base
 of the scapula on the opposite side a very obtuse angle, and they both stand out on
 their whole length nearly three inches from the ribs. The arm cannot be raised be-
 yond the horizontal position ; after stooping at a right angle to the lower extremities
 he is quite unable to recover the erect position without help, and there is an evident
 lateral curvature of the spine ; both which I conceive to be consequences of the loss
 of power in the longissimus dorsi and sacrolum bales, and the deep-seated extensors
 of the spine. In his ordinary position the upper part of the body is thrown back, evi-
 dently to balance the weight of the head and upper part of the body, which in the
 healthy person is supported in the completely erect position by the above muscles.
 In analyzing the actions of the muscles attached to and influencing the movements
 of the scapula, we found that he could raise and approximate to each other and to the
 spine, the upper angles of the scapula, showing a complete freedom of the trapezius and
 of the levator anguli scapulae ; he can also approximate to each other the bases of the

 scapula, showing power in the rhomboidei. He can put his arm behind him freely and

 with force, showing that the latissimus dorsi is not involved. It is however doubtful,
 from the tilted-up position of the lower angle of the scapula, I conceive, that the slip of
 the latter muscle passing over the angle and assisting to bind down the scapula to the
 ribs, has lost its power, and do not pass beneath it. There is no reason to suppose
 any paralysis in the teres muscles, as the action of drawing the arm to the side and
backwards is performed with ease. The sub- and supraspinous muscles are very

 much developed, and the deltoid is of moderate size and retains complete power. The

 condition of the subscapula muscle can only be conjectured, yet it appears to be
 healthy and in good condition. The only remaining muscle connected with the
 scapula is the serratus magnus, whose function in the motion of the scapula is, along
 with the deltoid, to raise the arm above the horizontal position, and, making the in-
 sertion into the scapula the fixed point, co-operates with the pectoralis major in those
 more energetic dilatations of the chest which are on occasions required for respira-
 tion. The power of this muscle on both sides is completely destroyed ; and this ap-
 pears to be the most prominent lesion in the case. In elevating the arm above the
 horizontal position, this muscle takes up the action which has been carried so far by
 the deltoid, the supra and infra spinatus and the subscapularis. In the present case
 this action so far is perfectly performed ; but the further action in the elevation of the
 arm, to effect which the subscapularis is absolutely necessary, is in the present case im-
 practicable. The muscle, in consequence of its paralysis, is wasted and can scarcely
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  87

be distinguished. In both arms, in some degree, but in the right arm more particu-
larly, the biceps, triceps, and coraco brachialis appear to be completely atrophied, and
for some time I was puzzled to know how the contractions of the fore-arm, whose
muscles are well developed, could be effected, in the complete absence in both of any
evidence of action in the biceps. It appears, however, that this motion altogether
depends on the combined actions of the pronators and supinators, which are well
developed. The study of the variety of partial paralysis appears to me one of the
most fruitful means of examining the functions of different parts of the nervous cen-
tres, and the present case is one, the record, of which may at some future time
illustrate a community of source on the nerves proceeding to the muscles affected.
The serratus magnus is supplied with a nerve originating in the brachial plenus,
which Bell has classed among his respiratory nerves.

     Observations on the Evils arising from tJie Use of Common Pessaries.

                     By Charles Clay, M.D., Manchester.

   In this paper the ajjthor shows how very far removed from true mechanical prin-
ciples all the contrivances hitherto in use to support the uterus in situ have been, and
how very contrary to the structural arrangements of the parts to which such con-

trivances are applied ; that these remarks not only apply to mechanical means, but
to the various operations suggested of late by home and continental writers, which
the author endeavours to prove are cruel and uncalled for.

   Finally, the author recommends a new pessary, frequently applied by himself and
others with every success that could be desired, constructed on true mechanical
principles, and in accordance with the structural arrangements of the parts concerned

in its application ; a circumstance hitherto singularly neglected in the construction of

pessaries.

                   Case of Monstrosity, By Dr. Bardsley.

    Dr. Bardsley presented a drawing of a case of monstrosity, which was born in 1837,

and was alive in 1840. He had not heard of its death since, which he thinks he

should have done if it had taken place. In addition to a well and full-grown male
child, there were a pair of additional arms connected wfth the ensiform cartilage, and
an additional pair of lower extremities connected with one of the lowest ribs near the
transverse process of the corresponding vertebra.

               On Lithotomy and Lithotripsy. By Mr. Wilson.

   The author contrasted the advantages and disadvantages of both operations for re-
moving calculus. Lithotripsy, he said, had not fulfilled in practice the hopes which
its first advocates held out from it. Many circumstances rendered the practice of it
not only formidable but fatal. The statistics of lithotomy were stated at large, and
the views entertained by the author supported by numerous cases, which he detailed

at length to the Section.

ByOn the Registers of the Collegiate Church of Manchester.  the Rev. R.

Parkinson, B.D.

   Mr. Parkinson commenced his observations by giving a brief outline of the vari-
ous laws which had been enacted for enforcing an accurate system of registration.
The registers of the parish of Manchester commence in August 1573, and are con-

--tinued to the present time, with the following exceptions: one leaf for the year

1589 is lost, and during the period of the Commonwealth a chasm occurs in the regi-
sters for eight years and nearly three months.

   Of the 646 prisoners, there were English 446, Irish 172, Scotch 14, Welsh 14.
   With regard to the influence of particular employments in disposing men to in-

temperance, those engaged in laborious employments, as sawyers, smiths, carpenters,
and porters, were much less addicted to intemperance than tailors and others engaged
in sedentary occupations. Out of the 646 prisoners there were only seventeen fac-

tory operatives.

On the Vital Statistics of the Spinners and Piecers employed in the fine
            Cotton-Mills of Manchester. By Mr. Shuttleworth.

   Mr. Shuttleworth stated that the tables contained in his communication related to
nineteen cotton-mills in Manchester, being the whole of the establishments in that
town in which the spinning of fine numbers of yarn was carried on.

   The tables were delivered in evidence to the Factory Commissioners when sitting
in Manchester, and verified by the affidavits of himself and the agents employed.

   The summary of the facts obtained was as follows:
   The nineteen mills worked sixty-nine hours per week. They employed 837 adult
spinners, of which there were

                                               8 under 21 years of age.

   The united ages of these spinners was 27,367 years, giving thirty-two years as the
average age of each person. They had worked in cotton-mills 19,133 years, which

was equal to twenty-two years and ten months for each person. In the year 1832,

255 spinners, or nearly 30 J per cent., were absent from work on account of sickness,
an aggregate of 6296-V days, or an average of twenty-four and a half days for each
sick person, or seven and one-third days for the whole number of spinners employed.

Of the 837 spinners,
          621, or 74£ per cent., reported themselves to have "good health,''
           171, or 20£ per cent., reported themselves to have " pretty good health,"
            45, or 5f per cent., reported themselves to have " indifferent health."

   The 837 spinners employed 3233 boys and girls as piecers, or something less than

an average of four piecers to each spinner; and of these piecers 488, or 15 per cent.,

were relations to the spinners.
   The number of spinners married was 707. rather more than 84 per cent. The

united ages of the wives when married were 15,3764 years, equal to twenty-one
years each. The number of years of the marriages was 7907 years and five months,

equal to eleven years and two months for each marriage. In this period twenty-six

of the wives, or rather more than 3| per cent., were dead, and 681, or nearly 96§ per
cent., were living. Of the living,

             422, or 62 per cent., were reported to have "good health,"
              151, or 22^- per cent., were reported to have " pretty good health,"
               108, or 15^ per cent., were reported to have " indifferent health."
   The married spinners had had 3166 children, equal to four and a half to each mar-
riage; of these children 1922, or 60£ per cent., were alive, and 1244, or 39§ per

cent., were dead.

   Of the children alive, 1225, and of those who were dead, 1221 (making 2446, or
77^ per cent.), had never been occupied in any kind of work ; 640, or about 22 per
cent, of the whole, had worked in cotton-mills, and fifty-eight, or near 1 \ per cent.,
had worked at other occupations. Out of the 640 who had worked in mills, eighteen,
or about 2J per cent., were dead; and of the fifty-eight who had worked at other
employments, four, or nearly 7 per cent., were dead. The cases of distortion amongst

the 640 children were eight, or 1^ per cent., and there had been seven cases, or
something more than 1 per cent., of mutilation from machinery.

   On the Increase of Property in South Lancashire since the Revolution.
                             By Henry Ashworth.

   Mr. Ashworth commenced his observations by stating that they more particularly
related to the Hundred of Salford. The figures on which he proposed to found a
comparison of the past and present state of Lancashire were taken from a Parlia-
mentary return of the assessment for the Land-tax in 1692 and the authorized
statements of the county assessment for 1841. With respect to the progress of the
population he had no returns previous to 1801.

   In estimating the assessment value of property in 1692, he multiplied the gross
amount of the land-tax, which was then is. in the pound, by five, which he considered
a very close approximation to the real annual value of the property in the county at
that period.

   The following table, constructed by Mr. Ashworth from the above data, shows the
comparative increase in the several Hundreds of Lancashire.

                              Hundreds.

   In certain other towns, some of which lie contiguous to those contained in the last
list, the average increase has not exceeded 2100 per cent., as the following table will

On the Industrial and Training School about to be erected in the neighbour-
                    hood of Manchester. By Mr. Gardner.

   The projected building will be erected at Swinton, in the vicinity of Manchester,
for the pauper children in the three Unions contained in the parish of Manchester.
The building will accommodate 1500 children. Twenty-three acres of land have
been taken in addition to the ground required for the building, in the cultivation of
which the children will be employed.

On the Influence of the Factory System in the development of Pulmonary
                         Consumption. By Mr. Noble.

    Mr. Noble prefaced his observations by a statement that the opinions of medical
men were at variance as to the effect of the factory system on the health of the

 operatives.

    In Manchester and Salford, according to the census of 1831, there were resident
49,392 families. The total deaths registered in 1839 amounted to 9223, of which
 1454 were recorded as having been from consumption; that is, about one death
from consumption to every thirty-four families ; and in the total deaths from all
causes, three from consumption in every nineteen.

    In Essex, with a population of 62,403 families, the deaths from consumption in
1839 were 1201, and the total number of deaths 6352; the deaths from consumption
being less by about 250 than in Manchester, although the population of Essex in 1831
was 13,000 families above that of Manchester. The cases of consumption, however,
were fewer, relatively, in the factory district than in agricultural Essex, being in the

latter as four in twenty-one, in the former three in nineteen.
    In a district embracing Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, and the southern parts

of Lincolnshire, and comprising a population of 67,351 families, in 1839 the deaths
from all causes were 7306, and those from consumption 1308, or nearly one in
five, showing, as in the case of Essex, a much lower rate of mortality than that
of these districts, but a greater relative proportion of deaths from pulmonary com-

plaints.

    Mr. Noble then compared other large towns where there were no factories with
Manchester. In 1831 the population of Liverpool and West Derby was 43,026
families; in 1839 the number of deaths registered was 9181, being only forty- two
less than the number of deaths in Manchester. The deaths from consumption were
1762, or about 300 more than in Manchester.

   In 1831 the population of Birmingham was 23,934 families; in 1839 the number
of deaths registered was 3639; those from consumption being 668, being again a
smaller relative proportion than in Manchester.

   In 1831 the metropolitan districts contained 373,209 families; the deaths were
45,441 ; those from consumption 7104, being in the proportion of two to 105 fami-
lies, or three out of nineteen deaths from all causes.

   Considering that the township of Manchester contained a fair proportion of the
factory population, Mr. Noble had examined the registers of deaths from consump-
tion for the years 1838, 1839, 1840, limiting his inquiry to the ages between fifteen
and forty. In these three years he found that, with a population of about 160,000,
and with an average of 6000 deaths from all causes annually, there were 1141
registered deaths from consumption; of these 174 were of persons working in

factories.

   The factory operatives were divided thus :

Spinners       45
Winders        49
Piecers        28

Chester, Carlisle, Paris, Edinburgh, Nottingham and Philadelphia, gave the follow-

ing proportions :

From these and other facts omitted in this abstract Mr. Noble drew the conclusion,

that manufacturing habits do not exert any unusual influence in the production or

premature development of pulmonary consumption.

On Vital Statistics, with remarks on the Influence which tJie Atmosphere exerts
                 over the rate of Mortality. By Dr. Ashton.

   After noticing that a great diminution in the rate of mortality had taken place in
Europe within the last fifty years, Dr. Ashton called attention to the fact, that, not-
withstanding the large town population, the average mortality of England and Wales

was much lower than that of most other countries in Europe. He then showed the

importance of proper ventilation in dwelling-houses, and the evils arising from a
want thereof.

On the Destitution and Mortality of some of the great Towns of Scotland.
                                 By Dr. Alison.

Dr. Alison, in confirmation of statements made by him at the Meeting of the Asso-

ciation at Glasgow, stated, that in the early part of last winter it appeared that

at Edinburgh 21,600 persons, in a population of 137,200 (excluding the garrison of

the castle), were in a state of utter destitution, and were recommended for gratui-

tous relief to a committee appointed to distribute a charitable fund raised by sub-

scription on the birth of the Prince of Wales. In addition to these, 5000 more,
who were not so miserably destitute, were recommended for relief in the way of

provisions and fuel at a reduced price. To the 21,600 are to be added the inhabit-

ants of the three workhouses and of the House of Refuge, making a total of above

23,000 persons out of 137,200, or 16*8 per cent., who during at least a part of the
year " of necessity must live by alms." Of this number not above 7000 are admitted

as paupers to legal relief, so that 16,000, or 11-6 per cent, of the population, during

part of the year have no lawful means of subsistence.
   In the several epidemics which had taken place in England since the English

Registration Act came into force, he could not find that the annual mortality in any
of the towns had ever exceeded I in 30. In Glasgow the mortality had reached this
amount on an average of five years ; and in 1837 it had been 1 in 24, exceeding that

recorded in any year in Liverpool by 25 per cent.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   _.
   Dr. Alison stated that in a communication made by him to the London Statistical

Society as to the mortality at Edinburgh and Dundee, there had been an error for

want of the proper deduction for still-born children, but that after making that de-

duction, the mortality at Dundee in 1836 (the worst year of epidemic fever there),

      On Loan Funds in Ireland, By Henry John Porter, F.S.S.,

                                               Tandragee, Ireland.

   This paper was a continuation of the account of the operation of the Loan Funds
in Ireland, read before the British Association at the Meeting at Plymouth in 1841.
Since that time the following increase has taken place. There are now of these in-
stitutions in Ulster 78, in Leinster 103, in Munster GO, in Connaught 27, in all

Ireland 268.

   The amount of money lent in 1841 was, in Ulster, 572,000/. ; in Leinster, 512,000/.
in Munster, 262,000/. ; in Connaught, 90,000/. Total, 1,436,000/.

   The number of loans granted was to Ulster, 149,000/.; to Leinster, 142,000/.; to
Munster, 98,000/.; to Connaught, 30,000/. Total, 409,000/.

   The profits, after paying all expenses, were, in Ulster, 5836/. ; in Leinster, 6791/.
in Munster, 2802/.; in Connaught, 645/. Total, 16,074/.

   The number of persons who had invested their savings in these societies was, in
Ulster, 1528; in Leinster, 1824; in Munster, 941; in Connaught, 235. Total, 4528.

        On tlie Monts de Pike in Ireland. By H. J. Porter, F.S.S.

   This paper was a continuation of communications made by Mr. Porter at the
Meetings of the Association at Glasgow and Plymouth. Mr. Porter stated that the
total capital invested in these establishments was 26,883/. The number of articles
taken in pledge in 1841 was 351,408, on which the sum of 61,944/. had been lent iu
sums varying from 30s. to less than 1*.

On the Commercial Statistics of France in 1840. By the Rev. H. L. Jones.

From this paper it appeared that the total amount in value of the trade of France

(exports and imports included) in 1840 was 2063 millions of francs, an amount

greater than in any previous year.

In 1826 the total trade (exports and imports included) was 1 1 26 millions of francs.

In 1836                                                 1876

In 1839                                                 1950

giving an increase for 1840 of 113 millions of francs.

The principal increase was in the imports (which at no former period had ex-

ceeded 1000 millions, but) which in 1840 amounted to 1052 millions. The exports

exceeded those of 1839 by eight millions. The "Special Commerce" of France (that

is, the produce of her own soil or manufactures exported, and the articles imported

for her own consumption, and included in the 2063 millions) was, in 1840, imports

747 millions, exports 695 millions; total, 1442 millions.
   Out of the total trade for 1840 the exports and imports by sea amounted to 1481

millions, or about 71J per cent., and those by land to 582 millions, or about 28£
per cent, of the 2063 millions.

   Of the imports and exports by sea, 705 millions, or 48 per cent., were effected in
French bottoms, and 770 millions, or 52 per cent., iu foreign bottoms. Of these

amounts 757 millions, or 51 per cent., were from or to European countries, 582
millions, or 39 per cent., from or to countries out of Europe, and 142 millions, or 10
per cent., from or to French colonies and fishing establishments.

    Mr. Jones concluded his paper by a long series of tables compiled from the pub-
lished official accounts of the French Custom-House, showing all the details of the
general and special commerce of France with England and the United States, and
the full details of the silk and cotton trade of France with all nations.

On t/ie Advantages arising from Spade Husbandry and Agricultural Edu-
                      cation. By Mrs. Da vies Gilbert.

   In this communication, being a continuation of that made at Plymouth, Mrs. Dayies
Gilbert stated, that by careful weeding, manuring and cultivation of the land, some
of her tenants raised forty bushels of wheat per acre, and were paying double the
rent which she had received for the same land when it was in large farms ; and that
out of one hundred and twenty-four tenants among whom the land was now divided,
not one had fallen a single farthing into arrear since 1830.

   With regard to an Industrial School founded under her patronage, it appeared
that the schoolmaster paid yearly eleven pounds for his dwelling-house and school,
and three pounds per acre for three acres of land. His school consisted of twenty
boys, of the average age of eight years, who worked for him at out-door labour three
hours a day in return for three hours' instruction in reading, writing and accounts.
Such labour amply rewarded him for the instruction he gave them.

which it appeared that the variation was much greater than was usually supposed.

On the Comparative Statistics of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge

   in the I6tk, 17th, and \§th Centuries. By James Heywood, F.R.S.

   Mr. Heywood had compiled part of this paper from a list of the number of persons
who had received the degree of Bachelor of Arts at Oxford from 1518 to 1680, in
the Ashmolean Library at Oxford, and a list of the number of persons who had
obtained a similar degree at Cambridge from 1499 to 1658, in the library of the

British Museum.

   The number of degrees of Bachelor of Arts conferred in Cambridge,

In 1500 was                       7
In 1530                          40
In 1560                         60
In 1590                        154
In 1600                        167
In 1620          , 271
In 1628                       315

  From 1628 to 1658 the numbers decreased ; the annual average from 1648 to

1658 being 174.
   The lists of similar degrees granted at Oxford and Cambridge from 1830 to

1840, showed that during the last ten years the increase had not been above the
number of B.A. degrees granted in 1628, and other years in the early part of the

first quarter of the 17th century.

   The number of B.A. degrees granted at Cambridge in 1630 was 291 ; in 1635,
275; and in 1640, near the time of the civil wars, only 240: in 1830 it was 324 ;

in 1835, 314; and in 1840, 339.

worked out the suggestion of Medhurst to practical utility, in a way at once simple,
efficient and capable of enduring the rough usage necessarily attendant on constant

and rapid motion.
   Reference was then made to certain of the drawings and sections representing,

drawn to the full size, an atmospheric apparatus equivalent in power to an ordinary
locomotive engine, but occupying much less space. It is described to be a cast-

iron pipe or tube of twelve inches in diameter, laid, in lengths like water-pipes, be-
tween the railway bars, and attached to the same cross-sleepers which support

them ; on the upper part of this tube is a narrow longitudinal slot or opening,
covered by a valve, the peculiar mode of opening and closing down and sealing
whereof constitutes the ingenuity of the contrivance. The valve is a simple flap
of leather, one edge of which is fastened down, so as to act as a hinge ; the upper
surface of the leather being plated in successive links with flat bar-iron, and the

under surface also plated, but with links of a segmental form, to complete the inner

periphery of the tube when the valve is closed down. In the tube moves a piston,

made air-tight by one or more leather collars ; at the end of the rod of this piston

is a counterweight, to keep the rod parallel to the axis of the tube : a connection is

made (by one or more plates of boiler-iron of sufficient size and strength, and called

the coulter,) between the piston-rod and the perch of a leading carriage or guiding

truck, in front of the train moving on the railway. In practice, the piston being in

the tube, and at some little distance in advance of the opening of the valve, through

which the coulter passes, a vacuum, more or less perfect, is made in that part of the

tube in front of the piston by an air-exhausting-pump worked by a steam-engine or

other stationary power ; the' air enters by the open valve, and presses at once and

directly at the back of the piston ; the opening through which the coulter passes is
raised only for a few feet-length at a time, and the valve is rapidly closed down again,

as  the  piston,  carrying  forward with  it  the  train,  moves  on              and being closed, the
                                                                               ;

edge of the valve-opening is hermetically sealed up, and the tube rendered air-tight

by a composition of bees'-wax and tallow, varied in certain proportions, according to

season and climate : this composition is laid at the valve-edge, in a groove, into which

it is pressed by a copper slide, kept just warm by heated charcoal in an attached box.

The whole of the mechanical arrangements of rollers, heater, &c. are very far from

being complicated,  not     liable  to get out of order,  and  easily  adjusted   when  deranged
                                                                                                                             ;

the operation being completely effected when the carriages travel at exceedingly

high velocities, as has been repeatedly done, leaving the tube ready to be again ex-

hausted of its air, and allow the next following train to be impelled by the atmo-

spheric pressure. In familiar illustration of the principle on which the piston-rod in

the tube connects through the valve with the carriage outside, the movement of an

ordinary pencil sliding in its case was referred to.

   One leading characteristic of this new system is that of substituting stationary
for locomotive power, and in this substitution the advantages will in many cases

be great. Even the old system of stationary power, connected with all the obstacles
of ropes, sheaves, &c, has still its supporters, both where passenger as well as mi-
neral traffic have to be carried on : but with the numerous economies which might
be combined in the atmospheric system, the stationary engine, with steam or water
as a prime mover to work the exhausting-pump, may once more take the field
against the locomotive. This stationary power is to be erected at long intervals on
the line of railway, and may certainly be placed at three or four miles, and pro-
bably at five, or even six or seven miles apart, working the exhausting-pump, which

will be connected by branches with the main tube lying between the rails.
   The air being drawn out by the pump, a certain amount of vacuum is produced

in front of the piston, creating a corresponding pressure on the opposite side of it,
being about half a lb. on every square inch of surface acted on by the atmosphere, for
every inch rise of the barometer. In the ordinary practical working of the apparatus,

the usual amount of vacuum obtained may be taken at that corresponding to 16 to

18 inches of mercury, or 8 lbs. to 9 lbs. per'square inch ; and experiments have fully
proved that the whole, or very nearly so indeed, of the pressure due to the degree of

exhaustion is obtained.
   The measure of the power for producing motion is the product of the transverse

sectional area of the tube in square inches, multiplied by the number of lbs. pressure
due to the vacuum ; various tables of these powers were exhibited, both for horizon-
102 REPORT-- 1842.

tal railways and for lines of every degree of acclivity, indicating also the respective

corresponding loads, in tons, which may be taken. Thus from a tube of 12 inches

diameter, with an 18-inch vacuum, or 9 lbs. pressure per square inch, there is ob-

tained an atmospheric power of fully 1000 lbs. ; being equivalent to the average ad-
hesive power of a locomotive engine ; and this power, with ever}' deduction for fric-

tion and resistance of various kinds (all which were specified and tabulated), will

propel 464- tons, or 10 carriages over a horizontal railway ; and 9t tons, or 2 car-
riages up an inclined plane of so steep a gradient as 1 in 28. With larger tubes and

greater pressure more power could be generated, and of course greater loads pro-

pelled. These representations were not based on theory only ; they were the results

of the working on a piece of experimental railway for the last two years and up-

wards on the West-London line at Wormwood Scrubs, only a few miles from the

metropolis. The tube at this place is only nine inches diameter; but there will be

a most complete practical demonstration on a larger scale shortly, on the opening of

an extension of the Dublin and Kingstown railway to Dalkey, now constructing upon

the atmospheric principle                                                                                                                  the tube thereon would                           be 15 inches diameter,                                the incli-

pump, &c. calculated to propel thereon heavily laden passenger-trains at extremely

high velocities.

  --Reference was made to another peculiarity of this system : If it were requisite to

turn on a lathe with care and scrupulous accuracy the insides of the tubes, the ex-

pense would exceed any reasonable limits; but a simple cutter is all that is necessary

to pass through the pipes on coming out of the foundry-sand ; they are then placed

in a proper receptacle and raised to the temperature of melting tallow ; in that state

a mop dipped in tallow is passed through the tubes, followed up by a wooden pis-

ton, which spreads the unguent in a complete coating, producing an even interior

surface : by frequent passage of the working piston, this tallow lining, or tinning, as

it were, becomes perfectly smooth and nearly as*hard as plaster of Paris, and no

doubt aids considerably in preventing atmospheric leakage, causing the piston to

work, practically speaking, in a tube of tallow, but protected by the iron pipe or

casing.

   With regard to the velocity attainable by trains impelled by atmospheric pressure,
it may be said to be independent of load or gradient ; in fact it is almost strictly

regulated by the proportion between the area of the tube and that of the exhausting-

pump                           that  is,  by the                                                                   velocity                with      which  the                  air    is  withdrawn  from                                  the  tube  by  the

pump. The exhausting-pump piston will travel at the same speed as the piston of the

steam-engine working                                                                                               it,  viz.               not    exceeding                      three  miles  an hour                                       if the trains are re-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

quired to run at the rate of thirty miles per hour, then the transverse-sectional area

of the air-pump must be made ten times that of the tube, and engine power must be

provided accordingly                                                                                               and so of other velocities.                                              This is independent of the load
                                                                                                                ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and gravity being practically an equivalent augmentation of the load to be moved, it

is consequently also independent of gradient. The tables exhibited were calculated

for various velocities, supposing there was no atmospheric leakage ; this must be

provided for, and is computed to require additional engine-power to the extent of

six-horse for every mile of pipe ; the chief leakage being at the longitudinal valve,

and therefore nearly constant, whatever the diameter of the tube.

It is evident this is a superior mode of employing stationary power, since

there is nothing to be propelled or moved but the carriages, and nearly the full

dynamic effect of the force generated is obtained. On the locomotive system, half

the load, on the average of all trains, consists of the engine and tender ; and in the old

stationary system there is the weight of the rope, with the expense and friction of

all the attendant mechanism, which is enormous ; and of this the Blackwall rail-
way is a palpable example, although the rope-and-pulley system has probably

been thereon carried to the greatest perfection of which it is susceptible. On the

atmospheric system, there is substituted for a rope of hemp or wire, a rope of air,

which, without weight or friction, transfers a power that may be called inexhaust-

ible and boundless ; and there is thus obtained the maximum of useful weight
carried with the minimum of resistance to be overcome.

In pointing out the table containing the several horse-powers of the stationary

engines to work air-pumps of different diameters, and to create and sustain the

vacuum in tubes of different sizes, an explanation was entered into of the term
                               --

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  103

horse-power, which was stated to be now generally computed by all makers
and purchasers of steam-engines from the diameter of the cylinder and length of
the stroke, taking in round numbers each such nominal horse-power as capable of

raising 60,000 lbs. one foot high with a given consumption of fuel : Watts's old
rule of 33,000 lbs. had long been abandoned, the principle on which it was origi-

nally founded being now understood as incorrect, though after all it was but a con-
ventional expression. The Commissioners who had been appointed by the Board
of Trade to investigate into and report upon the atmospheric railway, had not even
used Watts's rule correctly, and by this, and by reasoning and calculating on the
exhausting-pump employed in their experiments as theoretically perfect, and by an-

other unintentional misapprehension, the horse-power stated in their report as ne-
cessary to work tubes of certain lengths and diameters, was put nearly double the
horse-power as understood by the practical engineer. Some of the other opinions
and conclusions of the Commissioners were also adverted to and their soundness

impugned.
   It was then pointed out, that by means of self-regulating valves of a very simple

character, drawings and models of which were exhibited, the trains might pass on
continuously without necessarily stopping B.K each stationary engine ; and it was

also particularly observed, that it did not appear to be either necessary or advisable
to vary the diameter of the tubes at each variation of gradient ; but that the most
convenient arrangement would be to have the tube or main by no means limited in
diameter, and to work the different rates of ascent with corresponding degrees of
vacuum ; and this might conveniently be done, as such variation of pressure scarcely,
if at all, affects the speed of the train ; this, in fact, is one of the great advantages
of the system, as the power expended in obtaining and keeping up the various degrees
of exhaustion will be in the direct ratio of the increase of ascent and no more. If it
occurs that an inclination intervenes, sharper than could be advantageously managed

in this way, a larger tube may be laid down in that particular length of the railway.

   A remark was made that the atmospheric system might be applied to any existing

railway without interference with the mode of working with locomotive engines du-

ring the operation.

  A peculiarity of this system was explained by diagrams, to the following effect :

Suppose the travelling load to be fifty tons, the degree of vacuum necessary to ob-
tain a given degree of velocity, producing a pressure of 10 lbs. per square inch on

the piston ; so long as the load is the same and the line level, the train will
move with equal velocity, because the speed is due to the rapidity with which the
air is pumped out of the pipe. But if the load be only twenty-five tons starting

with the same pressure as with fifty tons, the train then runs faster than the air is
drawn out of the pipe ; the power behind being so great in the first instance as to
force the load forward at an increased rate. But this does not last long ; the pump

 going slower in proportion than the train, the air gets packed up, as it were, in front

 of the piston, and becoming less rarefied offers greater resistance ; the velocity of the
train, which is very great at first, gradually diminishes until the amount of vacuum
 becomes proportionate to the weight behind it, and then the train goes on uniformly.

 Again, supposing the train to start with a load which is rather heavy, with a pressure
 of only five or six pounds, the air is then drawn out quicker than the load can follow,
 and makes the vacuum more perfect ; and thus the power increasing gradually, the
 train increases its velocity until it becomes balanced with the vacuum. To ascend an
 incline may be called equivalent to adding to the load, and to descend, equal to dimi-
 nishing it ; when the train comes to an ascent it will reach the foot of the plane

 with a considerable velocity ; but its rate will gradually decrease as it ascends,
 until the power is brought up equivalent to the pressure, that is, until by the ex-
 hausting-pump going faster than the train, a power is generated sufncienj to drive

 it up the hill. In coming down hill, the trains will start at the top with very great

 velocity ; but the air will immediately begin to act in front as a buffer until the

 pressure is reduced. The moment the train comes to the level, its velocity will
 immediately increase ; and thus the speed is nearly uniformly regulated, whatever
 may be the inclination.

      In entering into the question of the cost of the atmospheric railway, several tables

 £were referred to, and it was distinctly and unreservedly stated that from 10,000 to
 £ 12,000 per mile was sufficient to construct a line on this principle in most parts of
--104 BEPORT 1842.

any country. Details were prepared to show this, drawn from actual estimates

made for the purposes of determining the expense of the apparatus and railway under

several greatly differing circumstances ; and the various economies contemplated were
mentioned. It was also observed that the recent improvements and simplifications

by Prof. Wheatstone of his electro-magnetic telegraph, had veiy greatly reduced the

expense of that invaluable invention ; so that for this indispensable accompaniment

of the atmospheric railway, no more than £100 per mile would be required. Much

stress was laid on the advantage of getting rid of the locomotive engine, which is a

constant source of dangers and accidents, and has always been the cause of the most

fatal ones ; at the same time adding greatly to the unprofitable weight of the train,
and requiring everything connected with the present details of railway construction

and furnishing to be proportionably large, heavy and expensive. On the atmospheric

system, the rails, and upper works generally, the carriages, vehicles, stations, build-

ings, and establishments, &c, will be all very much less costly. In laying out a
line, it may be suited to the undulations of the country, and earth- work greatly re-
duced ; bridges, and all other works of art, will be on a much smaller scale, not

simply in the arithmetical proportion of their heights or breadths, but more nearly

in proportion to the cubes of those dimensions ; and generally a saving in land,
damages, &c.

But the great paramount advantage is the perfect safety from collisions and

similar accidents, on the single lines of the atmospheric system, which railways

worked by locomotive engines, even with double lines, cannot possibly be free from.

Reverting to the stationary power, it was stated that the adoption of other

means than steam to work the air-pump and produce a vacuum in the tube, might

often be expedient and economical ; as water, where abundant, or where it could be

collected in reservoirs ; or where trains were not constantly passing, a small steam-

engine might be continually at work raising water to be used (over and over again

if needful) at the stated times when the traffic had to pass, and a short experience

would determine the exact quantity of water required to work a wheel for these given

periods ; and as the time necessary to produce the required exhaustion in any length
of tube is probably the same that the carriage would take to travel over the

same space, the exact measure of power to create and sustain the vacuum could be

calculated. But it is clear that the importance of obtaining the very cheapest

method of exhausting the tube would soon attract the attention of scientific and

practical men.

Allusion was made to the facilities which this system possessed of disengaging

the train from the piston-rod moving in the tube; and also to the very short space

in which the train could be stopped, by the ordinary break, and by destroying the

vacuum in front of the piston ; rendered still more easy by the absence of the vast
momentum, which from the weight of the locomotive and the heavier carriages,

is always an accompaniment of the present trains.

A summary of the principles of the  atmospheric railway concluded the lecture
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the Professor observing that the invention was but in its infancy, and that it was

scarcely possible to appreciate the results, when further developments, practically

brought out on a large scale, should bring this wonderful power still more within

the grasp and command of man.

Various models, drawings, tables, and formulae were exhibited to the meeting,

and constantly referred to in the course of the lecture, of which they were intended

to be illustrations.

        On Straight Axles for Locomotives. By Professor Vignoles.

   He stated that an unfounded prejudice existed in favour of cranked axles, which,
in his opinion, were inferior to straight ones in almost every point of view. With
straight axles the cranks were thrown outside the wheels, which gave more room for

the arrangement of the working parts ; and another great advantage was gained by
lowering the boiler nearly fifteen inches, and thereby increasing the safety of the
engine, by placing the centre of gravity nearer the rail. The original expense of the
engine and of the repairs was also much lessened. These advantages might be

shown by a reference to the Dublin and Kingstown Railway. By introducing

straight axles and outside cranks the expenses had been greatly decreased, no acci-
                                                                          :

dent had ever occurred from breakage ; and such increase of room had been ob-
tained, that they had placed the tender underneath the engine, thus fixing the centre
of gravity as low as possible, and dispensing with the separate tender. By this
arrangement they could run fifteen miles without stopping for water. He had found
much difficulty in introducing the straight-axled engine on this line ; and, in fact,
the great obstacle in obtaining a fair trial for different forms of engines arose from
the fluctuation in public opinion. Straight axles and cranked axles, four-wheeled
and six-wheeled engines, had been used on different lines, not so much from the
recommendations of the engineer as in compliance with the opinion of the several
railway boards. Just now a prejudice existed against four-wheeled engines, as being
less safe than six-wheeled, more liable to run off the line, &c, whereas he con-
tended that the four-wheeled engine per se was not open to these objections. He
believed that the principal advantage which could be claimed for the six-wheeled
engine was in the disposition of the weight on the wheels, and having the third pair
of wheels and axle, in case of accident to either of the other pair ; and a consideration
of the fatal accidents which had lately occurred on the London and Brighton and the
Paris and Versailles railways, would show that they arose from other causes, and
had no reference to the engine having four wheels or six. He considered that both
accidents arose from similar causes : in both cases heavy trains and two engines
were coupled together, the smaller one leading ; from some cause a check took
place, the engine-man shut off the steam of the leading engine, and the following
engine, with the immense momentum derived from weight and velocity, struck
against it, forcing it off the rails, and causing the overturn of the carriages. It was
considered objectionable to use an auxiliary engine behind a train, because, in case
of any retardation of the engine in front, it cannot be checked in time to prevent

great concussions of the carriages. Similar objections applied to using two engines

under any circumstances, especially when of unequal power. Many accidents had
taken place in consequence of the breaking of cranked axles ; and M. Francois and

Col. Aubert, in their report to the French government, had remarked that the frac-
tures of broken axles, instead of the fibrous appearance of wrought iron, presented
the crystallized appearance of cast iron, which they attributed to magnetic or electric
changes in the molecular structure of the iron, caused by friction in the bearings and
great velocities ; and in his opinion it was probable that the continual strains and
percussions to which the cranked axle is subjected will account for the changes in

the molecular constitution of the iron.

On the Strength of hammered and annealed Bars of Iron and Railway

                      Axles. By James Nasmyth.

In locomotive engines the axle was the chief point of danger ; and it was there-

fore important, both as a scientific and practical question, to determine the nature

and habitude of iron when placed under the circumstances of a locomotive axle.

Experiment was the only way to discover this, and he would have wished to place

iron under exactly similar circumstances ; but the short time intervening since

the subject had come before the Section had rendered it impossible to do so. One

opinion was, that the alternate strains in opposite directions, which the axles were

exposed to, rendered the iron brittle, from the sliding of the particles over each other.

To illustrate this, Mr. Nasmyth took a piece of iron wire and bent it back and for-

ward                            it broke in six bends.  He had suggested annealing as a remedy for this de-
                             ;

fect : in proof whereof he took a piece of annealed wire, which bore eighteen bends,

showing an improvement of three to one in favour of annealing. He should there-

fore advise railway companies to include in their specification, that axles should be

annealed ; and would moreover most strongly recommend that where any doubt

existed as to a change for the worse having (from whatsoever cause) taken place in

respect to deterioration of the tenacity of the iron of the axle, the simple but effective

process of annealing should be had recourse to, which would be found to restore its

original toughness ; he did not like the custom of oppressing engineers with useless
minutiae in specifications, but this was so useful and so cheap, that he thought it

ought to be insisted on. To exhibit on a larger scale the effect produced on iron in

our workshops, he showed a specimen of iron as it came from the merchant

being nicked with a chisel, it broke in four blows with a sledge, at the temperature
--106 REPORT 1842.

of 60°, with a crystalline fracture ; by raising the temperature 40° higher, it bore

twenty blows, and broke with the fibrous or ligneous fracture ; so that the quality

of iron was not the only circumstance to be considered as influencing the fracture.

Mr. Nasmyth noticed also the injurious effect of cold swaging, as causing a change

in the nature and fracture of the iron.  Swaging  was   necessary in                                 many cases
                                                                                                                                                           ;

for instance, when an axle had collars welded on, these could not be finished with
the hammer alone, certain tools called swages were used, from the action of which

great condensation of the iron took place, and a beautiful polish was given to the
surface, with what injurious effect he would show by the next specimen, which had

been heated red-hot, and then swaged till cold ; it broke at one blow without nick-

iDg, and the fracture was very close and beautiful, like steel. This showed the fal-

lacy of considering close fine grain a good test of excellence in wrought iron ; but

moderate swaging was often necessary, and not injurious, unless where an over re-

gard to finish carried it to excess. To prove that annealing restored the toughness

and fibrous texture, a portion of the last bar was heated, and swaged till cold as

before, then heated dull red, and left to cool gradually ; it bore 105 blows without
breaking, as was shown by the specimen ; this proved that the fibrous structure was

restored by annealing, and he therefore thought it should be insisted on in specifica-
tions. The effect of heating to welding-heat was very injurious, unless the iron was

subsequently hammered to close the texture ; a piece of the same iron heated to weld-

ing, and left to cool, broke without nicking in one blow, showing very large crystals,
especially in the centre. The effect of nicking was also very singular. The strength

of iron was generally stated to be proportional to its sectional area ; but,a nick not
removing -ri-oth of the area, took away TVth of the strength. Mr. Nasmyth broke
a piece of nicked, or rather scratched wire, to illustrate this point. These and similar

things did not prove that science and practice were at issue ; but, as Halley reached

the great accuracy of his prediction of the return of his comet by taking into account
the disturbing forces of Jupiter and Saturn, and the other planets amongst which

the body had to pass, so scientific men should seek in the workshops correctional

formulae, by learning there the practical occurrences which would elucidate and cor-

rect their theories.

On the best Form of Rails and the Upper Works of Railways generally.
                             By Prof Vignoles.

  He wished to compare the two chief systems of laying down rails, with chairs

--and without, and to do so he referred to two diagrams : No. 1, exhibiting the

heavy rail and heavy chair used on the South-Eastern Railway, the weight of rail

being 80 lbs. per yard, and the chair 20 lbs. : the rail was fastened in the chair, not

with iron, but with a longitudinal plug or key of wood : this mode of laying rails

was found to answer very well.  No.  2   was  invented  by Mr.  Evans                                it was rolled
                                                                                                  ;

with a slot or groove running along its under side ; this slot, after coming from the

first rollers, was rendered dovetailed by compressing the bottom edges of the rail

towards each other, thereby narrowing the slot at the bottom. These rails required

no chairs, having continuous bearing on longitudinal wooden sleepers, being fastened

down by bolts, with dovetailed heads slid into the groove, and which, passing

through holes in the timbers, were secured with a nut and washer at the under side.

He had suggested this improvement, as they had been previously fastened with a

cotter. By this method all the difficulties attendant on fastening down the chairs

were removed. The chairs had been fastened with bolts and screws, but he had

found that on the slightest loosening the bolt-heads flew off, from the continual per-

cussions, and the screws very soon allowed vertical play from the yielding of the

fibre of the wood. By Evans's rail we secured the rail without the intervention of

the fibre of the wood. One inconvenience attending it was, the trouble of scraping

away the earth to tighten the nuts when necessary ; but this might be partially

remedied by placing the bolts as often as possible in the transverse gutters for drain-

ing the road, by which at least one-half the bolts might be easily got at; and the

difficulty of tightening the remaining bolts would be lessened, if, as he recom-

mended, the timbers were left uncovered. He preferred thus giving a free circula-

tion of air, and disliked burying the sleepers in ballast. The weight of Evans's rail

was only 45 lbs. per yard, although quite strong enough, while that of the other with
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

                                                                                             TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                107

the necessary chair, was 100 lbs. The bevel in No. 2 rail might be given in the

wood-bearing                                                                                 in No. 1  it was arranged in the casting of the chair                                                                                                                                                                                        this latter rail,

from having its top and bottom sides alike, had this advantage, that when it' began

to wear it might be turned round, or even turned upside down, which was a very

great advantage. He had for many years advocated wooden sleepers in preference to

stone, from his experience on the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, where he found that

the granite sleepers, the more massive they were the more injurious to the rails and

carriages. These had all been taken up, and longitudinal wooden sleepers laid down,

and the saving in expense of repairs would in a few years reimburse the outlay. The
railway only costs now 50l. per mile per annum for repairs, notwithstanding the

great traffic over it. The rails were the old 42 lb. rails, and, nevertheless, were still

used, in consequence of the advantage gained by the continuous bearings. He re-
commended keeping Evans's rail to the gauge by light iron rods passed through

holes in the rails, and secured by nuts : he thought these transverse ties should

never be used as supports.

On Combustion of Coal, with a view to obtaining the greatest Effect, and pre-

       venting the Generation of Smoke. By William Fairbairn.

 --The author divided the subject into 1st. The present state of knowledge as to

the combustion of fuel, particularly as regarded the boilers of steam-engines. 2nd. The
relation and proportion of the furnace and boiler. 3rd. The dimensions and height
of the chimney, and its proportion to the boiler and furnace. 4th. The working of
the furnace, and the mode of obtaining the nearest approach to maximum effect.

In reference to the combustion of fuel, he observed, that our knowledge was

limited ; but, from the care of the fire being intrusted to persons of little knowledge
or experience, much lamentable waste occurred, from rapid combustion and the over-

working of boilers. Great loss also ensued from want of boiler space, and by work-

ing the engines to double what was intended by the maker, thus rendering it neces-

sary to force the fires to extract from the boilers sufficient steam. 2nd. With refer-

ence to the relation and proportion of the furnace and boiler. It was observed, that

in our present boiler furnaces, the ratio of fire-bar to flue surface is about 1 to 11,
or 100 square inches of grate-bar to 8 square feet of flue. But the Cornish engines

have much more flue surface, and other engines much less. He had always endea-

voured to give 12 - 5 feet of flue surface to 100 square inches of grate, or 1 to 18 nearly

and in marine boilers it is about 1 to 14"28. He found that, in a well-proportioned

boiler of 1 to 14, a pound of good coal evaporated 7'46lbs. of water, which was the
maximum effect produced in this district. By increasing the flue surface, the system

of slow combustion was established, and the evaporative power increased.

Mr. Fairbairn then read a table of experimental observations respecting ten steam-

engines working in Manchester ; the mean results were, power of engine nominally

44"5 horses, working up to 57*3 horses ; area of grate, 48 - 2 square feet ; area of flue

surface, 542*5 square feet ; ratio of grate to flue surface, 1 to 1 1 ; height of chimney,

117 feet ; coal consumed in pounds per horse per hour, 10"5 (the table contained the

indicator diagrams of the several engines) . Thus it appeared that the ratio of fur-

naces to flues was of great importance. He had found that a marine boiler, with 100

square inches of grate bar, and 10 square feet of flue (exclusive of the bottom sur-

face of the flue), and having 40 feet of flue length from fire to funnel, generated an

ample supply of steam without forcing the fires. He also directed attention to a

table in which six different kinds of boilers were shown, with the ratio between their

heating or recipient surfaces and their cubic contents, from which it appeared, that

the best boiler in these conditions was the cylindrical boiler with internal tubular
flues. 2nd. The cylindrical boiler with internal flue. 3rd. Waggon boiler with in-

ternal flue. 4th. Waggon boiler without flue. 5th. Cylindrical boiler without flue

and last, the old haycock, or circular boiler.

3rd division. There is no certain rule respecting the dimensions of chimneys. In

the Manchester district the custom was to place the chimney in some prominent po-

sition at a distance from the furnace, requiring underground flues of sometimes 400

feet long. This custom was injurious ; as, from damp, &c, the draft was diminished,

and it was necessary to have recourse to descending flues, which were contrary to

just principles.                                                                             The chimneys should be placed near the boilers when practicable
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;
--108 REPORT 1842.

and descending, and even horizontal flues, avoided as much as possible. With respect
to the height of chimneys, we can hardly err in going too high, as the draft is as the
height of the column of rarefied air ; we thus can always obtain a plentiful supply
of air to our fires. Some persons consider that the chimney should be widest at the
top, to allow of the free passage of the rarefied air ; but this was inconvenient in
building, and he had not found it to give any advantage. In general, chimneys, in
consequence of their great height, were built broad at the base and tapered towards
the top, both externally and internally. This was also disadvantageous, as it throt-
tled the draft. He found parallel flues, well-plastered, to be the best in every respect.

   4th. With respect to the best methods of working the furnace, and obtaining the
nearest approach to maximum effect, he had endeavoured to obtain, by direct experi-
ment, the comparative consumption of coal, in Mr. Williams's plan, and the common
practice. For this purpose he got Messrs. Hetherington and Co. to attach Mr. Wil-
liams's apparatus to their boiler in January last. This boiler supplied a 12-horse en-
gine, and gave motion to machinery, tools, &c. During the experiment great care was
taken, to keep the work steady, and to regulate the firing, so as to give equal chances
to each system. The result was slightly favourable to the old plan ; but as there was
reason to' doubt its accuracy, the trial was repeated, when the results showed a saving
of Ty,/ in favour of the new system ; or, by taking the average of all the experiments,
the consumption on the new system was to that on the old as 292 to 300, or about
4 per cent, in favour of Mr. Williams's plan on the score of expenditure ; while, on
the point of its abating the nuisance of smoke, no doubt could arise.

On testing the Efficacy of the several Plans for abating the Nuisances from

  Smoke by effecting a more perfect Combustion. By C. W. Williams.

The usual mode of measuring combustion, he stated, was the ascertaining the

quantity of water  evaporated    by      each  pound  of fuel                                           yet  this  was   the  most                                     fal-
                                                                                      ;

lacious of all tests, as from the varieties of boilers and the differences in their eva-

porative powers, their results were so at variance as not to be depended on. As re-

gards the nuisance, the appearance of the chimney was a sufficient test : but when

the question of economy was considered, a very different class of tests was required.

Economy has reference to two distinct objects; namely, 1st, the obtaining the

largest quantity of steam from a pound of coal ; and 2nd, obtaining such quantity

of steam in the shortest time. Thus economy has reference to fuel and to time ; and

it is important to observe, that the economy in the one is inversely as that of the

other. Mr. Williams observed that economy in fuel, that is, obtaining the highest

evaporative effect from each pound of          coal,  may be  the                                       ruin     of the  manufacturer
                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

for if his engine requires a given weight of water to be converted into steam within

a given time, if such quantity be not supplied the engine cannot do the required
work. Mr. Williams referred to a variety of experiments made by himself, Mr.

Parkes, Mr. Wickstead and others, showing that, by quick or slow combustion of

coal, the quantity of water evaporated from the same boiler, and by the same fur-

nace', varied considerably. This view of the question showed the necessity for
                                                                                                        for though heat may be gene-
distinguishing between  the      boiler  and   the    furnaces
                                                                                                     ;

rated by a more perfect combustion in the furnace, yet, if the boiler is not equal
to its absorption, the remainder will pass by the chimney and be lost ; and Mr. Wil-
liams showed that exactly in the degree in which the heat was increased in the flues,
was the waste heat also increased by the chimney. If then we look to the quantity
of steam generated, we must refer to the boiler and its evaporative faculty ; but if
we look to the quantity of heat generated, we must refer to the furnace and flues.

Mr. Williams then urged the importance, in testing any plan of combustion, of look-
ing as well to the temperature of the escaping products by the chimney as to the
quantity of steam generated in the boiler. The true test then is to be found in

ascertaining  the  quantity  of  heat    generated    rather  than                                      of  the  steam   produced                                      and
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

without any reference whatever to the boiler. Mr. Williams referred to an ingenious

and practical mode adopted by Mr. Houldsworth for estimating the temperature in

the flues of a boiler.

   Mr. J. Juckes exhibited and explained the model of his furnace for consuming
smoke and economizing fuel. His grate bars form an endless chain passing over

rollers, and moving forward about an inch per minute. The coals employed are
common siftings or screenings, heaped in a hopper (which may be made to hold
fuel for an unlimited time) outside the furnace door, which slides upwards. This
door is left a little open, and the small coal is spread uniformly over the bars
by passing under it. The air is constantly supplied through the bars, directly
to the fuel while burning ; and in this way perfect combustion is obtained. The
bars being slowly moved on, carry the ashes to the ash-pit, which lies at the
back of the grate. Clinkers are prevented from encrusting the bars by their passing
under a gauge, which effectually removes them ; and the burning away of the bars
is prevented by their constant motion from the hottest place. The bars or chains,
with their rollers and driving wheels, are fixed in a frame, which can be completely
drawn out from under the boiler for the purpose of removing injured bars, or any

other purpose.

On an Indicator of Speed of Steam Vessels. By J. S. Russell, F.R.S.E.

    This was a simple application of a well-known principle ; it was not novel, but he
 had applied it successfully, although others had failed. It depended on the hydro-
 dynamical fact, that if a reservoir be filled with water to a certain height, the water
 will flow from an orifice at the bottom with a velocity proportionate to the height
 and conversely, if the reservoir be empty and this orifice turned towards a stream,

 the water will rise in the reservoir to the height proportionate to the velocity. His

 plan was to pass a tube through the bow of the vessel, and carry it along the floor-

 ing to the centre of gravity of the vessel", where it terminated in a vertical glass
 tube, exhibiting the weight of water within. To this tube there was attached a
 moveable scale, the zero of which being placed on a level with the point at which
 the water stood when the vessel was at rest, the rise of the water in the tube when
 the vessel was set in motion exhibited the velocity at which the vessel was passing

 through the water. He had tested the accuracy of this indicator by sailing vessels

 at least twenty times, over a measured distance of 15f miles, and comparing his tube

 with Massey's log, the common log, calculations from the number of strokes, &c,
 he found it more accurate than any. By putting a stopcock in the pipe just under
 the glass tube, he was enabled to regulate the orifice until the greatest regularity
 was obtained, and he could now depend on the indications within the twentieth of a
 mile. From these experiments he had constructed a scale, which he exhibited, and
 of which the following is an extract ; the first column exhibiting the speed in miles

 per hour, and the second the height of the water in the tube above the zero line, ex-

' pressed in feet :

habits and poverty of the people, united with deficient ventilation. There were at
one time fifty-seven persons ill at one time with fever in this house, and five had
been seen ill in one room. At the end of 1832 a system of ventilation had been
established, and since then fever has all but disappeared from the house, although,
during five of the years which have elapsed since 1832, there were above fifty-live
thousand cases in Glasgow. The plan here adopted is extremely simple, and might

Abe easily introduced in any place where there is a furnace or active flue not far off.

small tube is led from an upper corner of each room containing a family. It joins a
main tube in the adjacent gallery. The main tubes of the various floors, four in
number, join in one vertical tube descending along the gable of the house, which
enters by a channel of brick-work the flue of the mill. Thus a constant draught is
kept up in every room of the house, fresh air being liberally enough supplied by
chinks in the doors and windows.

  A description, illustrated by drawings, was then given of the application of the

same plan to the Princess Royal, a steamer recently launched on the Clyde. In this
case, each berth in the vessel has a tube for drawing off the used air. These tubes
join main ones, which unite in one which supplies a stove upon deck. The exchange
of air thus produced in the necessarily small sleeping rooms of the vessel has been
productive of a degree of comfort which is felt by every passenger.

   The paper also described a washing apparatus for infected clothes, and an hospital
bed for fever patients, in both of which cases bystanders are secured from the volatile
matter of infection by the drawing off of that matter through tubes towards a fire-place
or °rate. Finally, there were illustrated descriptions of an application of the plan

to the Glasgow Fever Hospital.

Abstract of a Description of a Self-acting Waste Weir and Scouring Sluice.

                                By J. F. Bateman.

   The mode of construction here suggested is one for obviating the injurious effects
and inconveniences of fixed weirs in rivers, arising principally from the operations of
floods in filling or silting up the channels of navigable or other rivers, and in iuun-

datino- the adjacent country where it is elevated but little above the surface of the

water.

The plan proposed is to hang two gates vertically across the stream, one above

the other, so adjusted upon horizontal axes that in an ordinary state of the river the

pressure  of the  water will  be  sufficient to  maintain  the gates  in  their vertical  position
                                                                                                                              ;

but that as the water rises in a flood, the pressure will so act upon the unequal por-

tions or leaves of the gates, as to open them, by pressing outwards the upper part or

leaf of the upper gate, and the lower leaf of the lower gate, thus opening, in addition

to the top, two passages for the escape of the water, a space between the gates and
an opening at the very bottom of the weir, which will act as a scouring sluice, and

allow all deposit of silt or other matter to be carried away.

For example, suppose a waste weir twenty feet in length and five feet deep, con-

sisting of two gates, the upper one three feet, and the lower one two feet in depth.

If These gates are so hung that in an ordinary state of a river the pressure upon the

lower leaf of the upper gate and the upper leaf of the lower gate exceed the weight

upon the other two leaves 300 lbs., that will be the closing force exerted in keep-

ing the gates in their vertical position. In this arrangement the area of the leaves

against which the closing force is exerted will be only about one-half of the area of

the opening leaves, so that in a rise of water above the top of the weir, two lbs. are
Aadded to the opening force for one to the closing force.
                                                                          foot of rise would add

a pressure upon the whole weir of 1250 lbs., say 1200 lbs., 800 of which would be

exerted as an opening and 400 as a closing pressure, being a difference of 400 lbs. in

favour of the opening force. As this is 100 lbs. more than the original closing press-

ure of 300 lbs., the gates would open with less than a flood of one foot in height.

By making half the top of the gate rise higher than the level of ordinary water, a

flood of under six inches would open the gates, and if so constructed, a partial open-

ing, by which the top of the weir should be depressed only about four inches, the
surface in a flood would be but two inches higher than the ordinary level, while the
quantity of water discharged over the top and by the openings below, would be equal

to a flood over a fixed weir of the same length of upwards of three feet in depth.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  Ill

   The sills against which the gates are made to fit, may be regulated so as to dis-

charge the largest flood of a river without allowing the gates to open further than
necessary, or in rivers where it is expedient to remove every obstruction to the cur-

rent, to prevent inundation, or to pass very large bodies of water, the sills may be
so arranged that the gates should assume a nearly horizontal position, opposing
little more resistance to the water than the thickness of the material of which the
gates may be composed.

On a New Steam-engine teorked with three kinds of Pressure, viz. Action of

    high-pressure Steam, the Expansion of Steam, and the Atmospheric Press-

   ure caused by its Condensation. By Mr. Shaw.

    The description was illustrated by models and drawings. The lower part of the
piston fits the cylinder and is steam-tight ; the upper part or plunger, in the form of
a hollow cylinder, is longer than the cylinder, and passes through a stuffing-box in
its cover. The piston rod rises through the middle of the plunger, and is connected
with the parallel motion ; the valve is a modification of the single slide, the upper
passage leading to the upper part of the cylinder, the middle to the lower part of the

cylinder, and the lowest to the condenser. When the piston is descending, the valve

admits steam to the annular space between the plunger and cylinder, when, the
middle and lower passages being open, the direct pressure of the atmosphere upon
the plunger, the high-pressure steam upon the annulus, and an additional pressure
of one atmosphere upon the annulus from the vacuum beneath, concur to produce
the down stroke ; during this the steam is cut off from the cylinder, and the com-
munication between the cylinder and condenser is shut ; the steam, which before
occupied the annulus, now acts against the plunger for the ascending stroke with
the whole force of expansion, the annular surface of the piston being then passive.

  A model and drawings of Mr. Shaw's hydraulic engine were also exhibited. In

this engine, the want of elasticity in water, which formed a great objection to the

application of that fluid to a piston, is supplied by the elasticity of air in a chamber
communicating with the cylinder ; it is well fitted for situations where the fall is

great, but the supply too small or the space too limited for the use of a water-wheel,

as in mines.

                     On a dry Gas-Meter. By Mr. Clegg.

    It acted on the principle of the differential thermometer, in which a difference of
temperature between two bulbs partly filled with alcohol, was shown by the rising

of the spirit in one and depression in the other. He had taken advantage of this

principle by suspending two little glass vessels, partly filled with alcohol and con-
nected by a tube, and by passing the gas over heaters it warmed one of these bulbs,
and the spirit was driven into the other, which, becoming the heaviest, swung to the
bottom of the arc in which the vessels vibrate ; here it in its turn becoming warm,
was emptied of its spirit, and thus becoming lightest, was in turn displaced ; the
continuance of these oscillations marked the flow of gas, and being registered by the
usual train of wheel-work, the number of vibrations had been proved, by many
careful experiments at all seasons of the year, to afford an accurate measure of the
quantity of gas.

On the Tliames Tunnel in its completed Condition. By Sir M. I. Brunel.

  A representation of the machinery, designated the shield, by the agency of which

the excavation had been effected and the structure simultaneously made up, was

exhibited.

   The shield, standing as it does between the ground and the constructed portion,
may be considered as the chief agent, on the functions of which everything essen-

tially depends.

   The Thames Tunnel, he remarked, including the shafts at each end, is a quarter
of a mile in length, its breadth is 37 feet 6 inches to 38 feet, and the height of the
excavation 22 feet 6 inches presenting therefore a sectional area of 850 feet.

                                                                                                                            ;

   The thickness of the ground over the structure, or over the shield, is 14 feet at the

deepest part, and the head of water at the highest tides is nearly 36 feet, and only

12 at the lowest tides.

The shield consists of 12 frames wholly independent of each other : each frame is

divided in three stories, thus 36 cells are provided for as many miners in front of the

excavation, and for a proportionate number of bricklayers who are to form the

structure at the back. The exterior part of the shield at the sides and top is covered

with cast-iron sliding plates                                                                                                                         and the front, viz. the whole  face of the excavation, is
                                                                                                                                                   ;

covered with small boards (42 in the face of each cell), consequently 540 upon the

whole : these are kept pressed against the ground by means of 1080 small screws,

which admit of being abutted against the front of each frame.

The frames at the back are made to bear against the structure by the interposition

and agency of powerful abutment screws resting against capacious plates.

The frames stand upon legs resting upon capacious shoes; and as an auxiliary

way, the frames have arms by which each frame may relieve itself upon its neighbour.

The body of the tunnel consists of a substantial square brick structure with two

arches. This structure fills the excavated area, and in this way all the mass of the

surrounding ground remains undisturbed.

The greatest attention, therefore, is to keep and to maintain the abutting screws in

their respective functions, not only to support the surrounding pressure, but to pre-

vent the ground becoming soft for want of resistance.

Sir M. 1. Brunei having so far explained his plan of proceeding, concluded by de-

claring that the tunnel was accomplished in the manner represented in the drawing and

model exhibited.

        On the Use of Beton and Concrete in constructing Breakivaters.

                                By Prof. Vignoles.

   The use of beton had greatly increased in France of late, especially in marine
works ; it was similar to concrete, but not exactly identical with it. Beton, like
concrete, was composed of lime mixed with broken stones, gravel and sand ; but it
required hydraulic lime, while concrete in this country was frequently made of
common lime when not to be exposed to the action of water. Beton was first in-
troduced in France by Belidor, and lately much advocated by Vicat ; since then
it had been much used, and he considered that attention was due to the use that
had lately been made of it in the Port of Algiers by M. Poirel, the engineer of that

harbour.

On tJie Construction of a Neio Rope employed as a Core in the formation of
   the Patent Stoppers, a Substitute for Corks and Bungs. i?y William

   Brockedon, F.R.S., Sfc.

   The patent substitute for corks and bungs is obtained by employing an elastic core
of fibrous materials of the form required, and covering it with a thin sheet of India
rubber. By this combination the tendency of India rubber to harden in these high
latitudes is overcome by the elasticity of the fibrous core, whilst the core is preserved
elastic by the impermeable quality of the India rubber with which it is covered.

But the matter which was more immediately offered to the attention of the Section, is
the important improvement which the invention has received by the adoption of cot-
ton cores, mechanicallv constructed, as a substitute for the felted wool which was
originally used ; by this improvement greater strength is obtained to resist the hold
taken by the entanglement of the cork-screw, and greater precision in roundness and
accuracy in size; with these come a train of consequent advantages and facilities in
the processes of manufacture, which will now be described. But a very short sketch
of the invention itself, prior to these improvements, is necessary.

    The idea of such a substitute for cork for stopping bottles and other vessels was
suggested to the patentee by Humboldt's researches in South America, wherein he
states that the Indians were accustomed to employ plugs made of India rubber for
stopping their vessels. The then recent importation of India rubber in large quan-
tities by Messrs. Enderby, and the price at which it could be obtained, suggested to
the patentee the idea, that if he could cut cores out of the solid blocks he should ob-
tain a valuable stopper for decanters ; he knew enough of India rubber to be certain
                                                                                            :

that in the pure material there was nothing to affect the flavour or odour of common
drinks, wine, heer, spirits, &c. The machine was constructed which made the cores,
but the first cold weather that set in so hardened them as stoppers in bottles, that he
might as well have attempted to withdraw ivory, of the same form, from the bottles
he then directed his attention to the formation of an elastic core, and found felted
wool the fittest for his purpose ; his first experiments with these were made at the end
of the year 1 834, and he carried them on for nearly five years before he secured his
patents, and it was only when he was seeking to manufacture so cheaply as to com-
pete with the price of common corks that he took out patents. Like most inventions,

its progress is a history, but the patentee only described enough to make his improve-

ments understood.

    For the attainment of his object he persevered through evil report and good report,
 and struggled with ignorance and prejudice ; the prize was a great one to attain, for a
million gross of corks are consumed annually in Great Britain for the bottling of
common drinks, and at least £250,000 paid for them. The inventor felt that he was
possessed of a better and fitter instrument for closing vessels than such imperfect ma-
terial as cork could furnish, for his stoppers are air-tight and firm, and will neither
fracture nor decay, nor be destroyed by insects ; he gave his constant attention to its
improvement, and he is now finding his reward in a demand from wine-merchants
and others far exceeding the present means of supply ; the manufacturers now em-
ploy from sixty to eighty men and children, and they will soon be enabled, by their
arrangements, to supply the stoppers to any extent, for the patentee has entered into
a connexion with Charles Mackintosh and Co. in Manchester, and their means and'
energies to carry out any manufacture which they undertake require no comment.

   When that engagement began the only practicable plan was to form the core of the

stoppers of coarse wool yarn, which in a long hank of fifty or sixty feet, and in quan-
tity sufficient for the size required, was fastened at one end and twisted at the other,
until it formed a round rope ; this was lapped with flax twine to preserve its cylindri-
cal form, until it had, by being beaten in fulling stock for some hours, become felted
into a solid rope; the twine was then unwound, and the rope subjected to further
fulling until it was felted to the hardness and size required : this rope was manufac-
tured for the patentee by Messrs. Whitehead of Saddleworth.

   The rope, when dry, was lubricated with India rubber dissolved in rectified naph-

tha, and then cut into convenient lengths of about three feet ; these were covered
with a sheet of India rubber ; when they were hard and firm they were again cut

into the lengths required for the stoppers ; the ends were then charged with some of
the same solution on a marble slab, and when dried off to a proper state of adhesive-

ness, sheet rubber was attached to the ends also; the excess was then trimmed off and
the stopper completed. But there was great difficulty in obtaining the wool-rope round,
and of an equal or required size throughout ; the fulling-stocks produced an imperfect
article ; nor was it always clean ; and dirt was charged as wool ; and when inferior
material was used, too often the case, the felting, one great means of holding the cork-
screw, sometimes failed; cotton was resorted to for the core, and after many attempts
and many failures, a core of cotton was combined, which the patentee then described.

  He takes a sufficient quantity of the slivers or rovings of cotton to form three

strands of the patent rope; these are gathered and drawn through three different

fixed holes or nozzles, around which bobbins, charged with strong flax thread, revolve,

and lap the threads round the strands as they are drawn out, with about eight turns

to the inch ; the three strands so lapped are then brought together through another
fixed nozzle of the size required for the stopper; around this revolves another bobbin
charged with a lighter thread, which binds the rope as it is drawn through and pre-
serves its cylindrical form, by lapping it with twenty or more turns to the inch ; this
being regulated by the different speed of the bobbins and that of the cylinder to which

the rope is fastened, and which draws it through the machine. This machine will make

about ten or twelvethousandstoppers perday,and is further capable,if required, of cover-
ing the rope with a sheet of India rubber before being removed from the machine.

   This rope so prepared exposes on its surface more than one-third of the lapping of
the strands of the strong flax thread, and when lubricated and the rubber attached to
it, each turn becomes a loop, which cannot be torn from the rubber on the surface
without destroying it ; and as each strand has eight turns to the inch, and the stopper is
three-fourths or seven-eighths long, there are no less than eighteen or twenty such

become entangled in several of these ; and the effect is not merely that a greater hold-
fast is obtained, but that the strain being oblique towards the centre, the stopper is
actually diminished in diameter by the force applied, and easily withdrawn, though its
resistance to pressure from within remains the same as to the felted stopper. It is a
peculiar property of the patent stopper, that India rubber will not slide on a smooth
dry surface, whilst it slides easily on a wet one ; therefore, in application, the stopper,
·which cannot be forced in dry, when wet slides with perfect ease into the mouth of
the bottle under the pressure of the thumb, and no more force than this is required in
stopping effectually bottled drinks. As rubber has the property of taking up about
one per cent, of water, the thin film of moisture between the surface of the stopper,
when wetted for application in the liquor to be bottled, and the mouth of the bottle, is
soon absorbed, the surfaces come into actual contact, and the stopper cannot be readily
drawn out, for its resistance to sliding is so great, that in a few hours the power of a
cork-screw is required to draw it : this quality to resist sliding renders unnecessary any
wiring or tying of the stoppers, even for effervescing liquors. The advantage there-
fore of the cotton core, as the stopper is now constructed, is, that whilst it holds with
equal firmness, it is more easily drawn by its diminishing under the force of the screw.
The roundness obtained by the new core thus made by machinery, now enables the
patentee to form the cylindrical sheet, on the surface of the rope itself, without a seam.
This again enables him to subject the stoppers to a heat of 150° without bursting ; and
 this heat, whilst it perfectly purifies the stopper, by driving off the naphtha, gives the
 patentee also the opportunity, of which he avails himself, of putting on the last end of
 the stopper under this temperature ; thus the expanded air at this degree of heat is all
that the stopper contains when hermetically closed ; as it cools, the atmospheric press-
 ure compels a closer contact of the covering, and no temperature in future purifica-
 tion, or of climate, can affect them.

      dry Powder of Clay compressed. By Sir J. Robison, F.R.S.E.

    The advantage was, that no warping or alteration of shape (excepting a little
 shrinkage) took place in the burning. From the accuracy with which articles formed
 by compression retained the shape of the mould, they could be fitted together very
 easily and smoothly. Sir J. Robison showed a piece of tesselated pavement made
 of these tiles, which, although laid together without cement, was perfectly smooth
 on the surface. He wished particularly to introduce to their notice a roofing-tile
 of a construction novel in this country : from the peculiar manner in which these
 tiles united by imbrication, a little Roman cement rendered them perfectly water-
 tight ; and from their not being absorbent, they were not liable to exfoliate, and
 would, therefore, be almost imperishable. The old form of tile weighs about
 105 lbs. per square yard, while this only weighs 58 lbs. They were manufactured
 at Stoke-upon-Trent, by Minten and Co.

    M. Bergeron, through Prof. Vignoles, explained his method of instantaneously

 casting loose the locomotive engine from the carriages. It is effected by a con-
 trivance attached to the brake, and worked when necessary by the brakesman. The
 engine was attached by a large chain, the last link of which was held, not by a hook,
 but by a bar which could be shot back or forward like a common door-bolt or lock
 by drawing this back out of its staple, it was of course drawn out of the chain,
 which being cast loose, all connexion between engines and carriages was sundered.

     Mr. Taylor exhibited some specimens of a new kind of drawing-paper, in which
 the novelty lay in the cement, by which the paper was mounted on a species of linen
 or canvas. The advantages offered were, equality of texture, neatness in junctures,
 and uniformity in expansion and contraction in both directions.

     Mr. L. Schwabe explained his method of spinning glass, and brought forward

 On the Abnormal Tides of the Firth of Forth. By Mr. Scott Russell.

He had on a former occasion presented to the section the result of tidal observations

on the Firth of Forth. These observations brought to light the existence of certain
very remarkable tidal pheenomena, proving the occurrence on some parts of that Firth,
of double tides, or rather perhaps of quadruple tides, being four high waters in each

day, instead of only two, as usual. When this subject was formerly discussed, Mr.

Russell had attributed these anomalies to the great southern tide-wave entering the
Firth at a different period from the great northern tide-wave, to which the periods of
high and low water on the east coast of Britain are principally due. But other expla-
nations had also been suggested in quarters so high as to entitle them to great respect.

    For the purpose of settling this question, and, if possible, reducing these anomalous
tides to some law, Mr. Russell had recentty instituted a second series of observations
on the tides of the Firth of Forth, conducted under very careful observers, the height
of the tide being observed simultaneously by different observers, at the different sta-

tions, who recorded their observations every five minutes, and continued them uncea-
singly night and day. They had only as yet extended over a few weeks, but already
there had come out of them results of a decided character, so as to set at rest the
question of the origin of these tides, and to illustrate some curious points in the history
of littoral tides. The tides already observed had, he thought, proved the accuracy of
the theory he had formerly advanced on this subject. But it would still be desirable
that these observations should be continued and extended. He then proceeded to ex-

hibit the results of the observations in a series of accurate diagrams of the tides.

This diagram represents the two successive tides of a day, as usually observed on
Athe coast of Britain. The line x, being on the level of a given low water, is divided

Ainto equal portions, representing hours, minutes, &c, and lines perpendicular to x,

ing low waters. In this case the tides exhibit the usual form, and at the mouth of

the Firth they are in tolerably close accordance with it. In the upper parts of the

Firth they deviate from it very widely, as in the following diagram :

                              Hi                         Tl; Ho

                                                      .

   These diagrams exhibit the following changes produced in the tidal course. First

of all, we have the tide rising to high water at h u falling to a low water at p u
rising to a second high water at Hi, with a verv small low water at px , between them

116 REPORT-- 1842.

then we have at the low waters, Li and L2 an elevation, and two depressions of an

equally anomalous kind. It also appears that the range or rise and fall of tide in-

creases as it travels, instead of diminishing. As these observations were reduced to

the same level, it further appeared that the high water-mark at Stirling was higher

than high water-mark at Leith by ten to fifteen feet. These diagrams, being compared

with the plan of the Firth, serve to show the effect of form of channel on the wave.

   Mr. Russell then proceeded to his explanation of these anomalous phenomena.
He referred to the very great progress which had recently been made in our know-
ledge of the laws and phsenomena of the tides. Mr. Lubbock had succeeded in deriving

all the principal phenomena of the tides most accurately from the equilibrium theory

of Bernoulli ; Mr. Whewell had constructed, from the discussion of a multitude of
simultaneous observations, empirical formulae by which the progress of the tide-wave

had been represented with a high degree of accuracy, and the theory of the tides had

attained a high degree of perfection. But there still remained a multitude of anoma-

lous facts for which received theory could not account, and amongst this number were

these refractory double tides. Mr. Russell's theory is this : that the tidal wave is a

compound wave of the first order ; that its phenomena are correctly represented by

the wave which he has called the great wave of translation ; that this tide's motion

Nowalong our shores is correctly represented by this type.  the wave of translation

in ascending a channel whose breadth and depth vary, exhibits the following pheno-

--mena : First, a velocity varying as the square root of the depth of the channel ; second,

an increase of height with the diminution in breadth and in depth of the channel

third, a dislocation of the centre, which is transferred forwards in the direction of
transmission according to a simple and well-established law. And these changes ex-

actly correspond to the epoch of high water, the law of rise and fall, and the exag-

geration of range in the Firth of Forth.

   Of the four successive high waters of each day, he has ascertained the latter tide of
each pair to be normal, and the earlier the abnormal tide. It is well known that the

tide which brings high water to the east coast of Britain, as far at least as the Thames,

comes round the north of Britain, and bringing high water to Aberdeen about noon,

Leith about two, and London about twelve o'clock at spring tides. This wave is the
same which brings to the whole of the Firth of Forth the normal high water, and of

the double tides the later of each pair corresponds exactly with the time as predicted

by the excellent tables of Mr. Lubbock. But if we conceive the great southern wave,

which comes up the English Channel, to continue its course northwards in the oppo-

site direction to the normal tide, it would enter the Forth at ten o'clock, being two

hours previous to the normal tide, due to the succeeding transit of the moon, or

the tide E at Leith will consist of the normal tide due to transit B and the abnormal

Nowtide due to transit A.  the double tides are in exact correspondence with these

conditions, the abnormal tide being generally about two hours in advance of the nor-

mal tide.

   But the circumstance which most perfectly fixes the identity of the tides, as due to

Athe successive transits and B, is found in the character of their diurnal irregu-

larities. If the theory adduced be correct, the normal and the abnormal tides will
have opposite inequalities. The observations made exactly correspond with this view ;
and, so far as they go, establish the soundness of the view which has been adduced

for their explanation.

Another remarkable confirmation of this view is derived from the examination of

the diurnal inequality of places on opposite coasts at the mouth of the Forth, the

diurnal inequality on the south side being that due to the northern or normal tide,

and that on the northern coast being that due to the abnormal or southern tide-wave.

At Leith both waves meet, and the inequalities nearly neutralize each other, and
give only the difference of the inequalities. By the same process, using the wave

of translation as a type of the tide-wave, some further anomalies of the tide-wave

were explained, and the absence of all tide frequently observed on opposite and adja-
cent coasts, as at the north of Scotland and the opposite coast of Norway. These are
explained by the fact that the lateral transmission of the wave is slower than its trans-

mission in the direction of its amplitude, so that the rapid advancement of one por-

tion of the wave gives divergence to the branches, which thus separate and leave an

interval of diminished tide or of no tide.
