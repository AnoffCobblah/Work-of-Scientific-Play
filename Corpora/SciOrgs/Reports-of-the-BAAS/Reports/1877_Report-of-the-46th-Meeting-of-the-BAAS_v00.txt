               REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                                 xlix

Report of the Council for the Year 1875-76, presented to the General
       Committee at Glasgow on Wednesday, September 6th, 187G.

   The Council have much regret in announcing that Sir Robert Chriatison,

"who was elected President for the Glasgow Meeting, informed the Council in
the course of last winter that he felt himself unable to preside, in conse-
quence of the state of his health. Under these circumstances the Council
selected Dr. Andrews, of Belfast, for nomination for the office of President
and the first business of the General Committee of the Association will be to
confirm this nomination. The Council also recommend that Mr. J. Young,
P.R.S., be elected a Vice-President of the Association.

   The Council hare received Reports during the past year from the General
Treasurer, and his Accounts for the year will be laid before the General Com-

mittee this day.

   The General Committee at Bristol referi'ed the following four Resolutions
to the Council for their consideration, and they beg to report their action

thereon in each case :

   --First Resolution. " That the Council be requested to consider the re-

           commendations of the Reports of the Royal Commission on Scientific
          Instruction and the Advancement of Science, and to take such action

         thereupon as may seem to them best calculated to advance the inte-

            rests of Natural Science."

   The Council having considered this Resolution, waited as a deputation
upon the Lord President of the Council and upon the Secretary of State for

the Home Department, and urged upon the Government the opinion of the

Association that it is of the highest importance to the welfare of this country
that the Government should without delay give systematic material aid to the
development of the higher Scientific Education, in the spirit of the Fifth and
Eighth Reports of the Royal Commission on Scientific Instruction and the
Advancement of Science ; and the Council further urged upon the Govern-

ment that, in the selection of Members of the proposed University Commis-
sion, Science should be duly represented. The Government promised to give
due consideration to tlie representations of the British Association ; and they
have increased the amount of the Grant to the Royal Society for aiding

fScientific Investigation.

   --Second Resolution. " That the Council be requested to take such steps

           as they think suitable for renewing their representations to the
           Secretary of State for India, as to the importance of establishing an
           Observatory for Solar Physics in India, in conformity with the recom-
           mendations of the Royal Commissioners on Scientific Instruction and
          the Advancement of Science."

The Council having learned that steps were being taken in India in refer-

ence to this matter, deemed it advisable to defer any action for tlie present.

1876.                                  d
       -- ----

i -·-  --"
                REPORT 1876. :

       --Tliird Resolution. " That the Council ho requested to consider and

          report upon the manner in which the Memhers of Committees and
          other Officers of the Association shall be selected, and whether Ladies
          shall be admitted to such offices, and if so, to what offices, and under
          what conditions."

   Upon this Resolution the CouncU have come to the following conclusion,

viz. :

               That it does not appear to have been the practice of the British
                     Association to elect Ladies as Officers of the Association, or to
                  place them upon the General. or Sectional Committees ; and they
                 are of opinion that no case has been made out for altering the

                      practice hitherto in force.

   --Fourth Resolution. " That the Council be requested to take into cou-

            sideratiou the expediency of appointing Representatives to attend the
           Liternational Statistical Congress to be held at Buda-Pesth in 1876."

   The Council have not taken any action on this Resolution.
   The Council regret to have to announce that Dr. Michael Poster, M.A.,
F.R.S., is unable to continue to act as one of the General Secretaries of the
Association. They cannot refrain from expressing their regret at the loss of

his valuable services.

   The Council have agreed to recommend that Mr. Philip Lutley Sclater,
r.R.S., be appointed one of the General Secretaries in his place. Mr. Sclater's
name will be proposed to the General Committee at the Meeting for the
Election of the Council and Officers on Monday next.

   The Council have added to the List of the Corresponding Members of the
Association the names of the following gentlemen present at the last Meeting

of the Association, viz. :

                                                   Dr. ITachtigal.

                                               Dr. Oppenheim.

                                            Dr. E. L. Youmans.

   The Council have been informed that invitations for the Meeting to be held
in 1878, or following years, wiU be presented from Leeds and Dublin.

   The following are the names of Members of Council for the past year who,

in accordance with the regulations, are not eligible for re-election this year,

Srx and thirt}^ years have passed over since the British Association for the
Advancement of Science held its tenth meeting in this ancient city, and
twenty-one years have elapsed since it last assembled here. The representa-

tives of two great Scottish families presided on these occasions ; and those who
had the advantage of hearing the address of the Duke of Argj-ll in 1855

will recall the gratification they enjoyed while listening to the thonghtful

sentiments which reflected a mind of rare cultivation and varied acquire-

ments. On the present occasion I have undertaken, not without anxiety,
the duty of filling an oiRce at fii'st accepted by one whom Scotland and the

Association would alike have rejoiced to see in this Chair, not only as a
tribute to his own scientific services, but also as recognizing in him the

worth}'' representative of that long line of able men Avho have upheld the
preeminent position attained by the Scottish schools of medicine in the middle
of the last century, when the mantle of E;erhaave fell upon Monro and

Cullen.

    The task of addressing this Association, always a difiicult one, is not ren-
dered easier when the meeting is held in a jilacc which presents the rare
combination of being at once an ancient seat of learning and a great centre

of modern industry. Time will not permit me to refer to the distinguished
men who in early days have left here their mark behind thera ; and I regret

it the more, as there is a growing tendency to exaggerate the value of later

discoveries, and to underrate the achievements of those who have lived before

us. Confining our attention to a period reaching back to little more than a
century, it appears that during that time three new sciences arose, at least
as far as any science can be said to have a distinct origin, in this city of
ADDRESS.  ]xix

Engineering. It is now conceded that Black laid the foundation of modern
chemistry ; and no one has ever disputed the claims of Adam Smith and of

"Watt to having not only founded, but largely built up, the two great branches
of knowledge with which their names will always be inseparably connected.
It was here that Dr. Thomas Thomson established the first school of Practical

Chemistry in Great Eritain, and that Sir W. Hooker gave to the chair of
IJotany a European celebrity ; it was here that Graham discovered the law

of gaseous diflusion and the properties of polybasic acids ; it was here that
Stenhouse and Anderson, Eankine and J. Thomson made some of their finest
discoveries ; and it was here that Sir William Thomson conducted his
physico-matheraatical investigations, and invented those exquisite instru-
ments, valuable alike for ocean telegraphy and for scientific use, which are
among the finest trophies of recent science. Nor must the names of Tcnjiant,
ifackintosh, Neilson, Walter Crum, Young, and Napier be omitted, who,

with many others in this place, have made large and valuable additions to

practical science.

    The safe return of the ' Challenger,' after an absence of three and a half
years, is a subject of general congratulation. Our knowledge of the varied
forms of animal life, and of the remains of animal life, which occur, it is now
known, over large tracts of the bed of the ocean, is chiefly derived from the
observations made in the ' Challenger ' and in the previous deep-sea expedi-
tions which were organized by Sir Wyville Thomson and Dr. Carpenter.
The physical observations, and especially those on the temperature of the
ocean, which were systematically conducted throughout the whole voyage of
the 'Challenger,' have already supplied valuable data for the resolution of
the great question of ocean-currents. Upon this question, which has been
discussed with singular ability, but under different aspects, by Dr. Carpenter
and Mr. CroU, I cannot attempt here to enter; nor will I venture to forestall,

by any crude analysis of my own, the narrative which Sir W. Thomson has

kindly undertaken to give of his own achievements and of those of his staflT

during their long scientific cruise.
    Another expedition, which has more than fulfilled the expectations of the

public, is Lieutenant Cameron's remarkable journey across the continent of
Africa. It is by such enterprises, happily conceived and ably executed, that

we may hope at no distant day to see the Arab slave-dealer rei)laced by the

legitimate trader, and the depressed populations of Africa gradually brought
within the j)ale of civilized life.

   From the North Polar Expedition no intelligence has been received ; nor
can we expect for some time to hear whether it has succeeded in the erowii-

iug object of Arctic enterprise. In the opinion of many, the results, scientific
or other, to be gained by a full survey of the Arctic regions can never be of
such, value ns to justify the risk aud cost which mufet be incurred. But if is

not by cold calculations of this kind that great discoveries are made or great
enterprises achieved. There is an inward and irrepressible imiJiilse in indi-

--viduals called a spirit of adventure, in nations a spirit of enterprise which

impels mankind forward to explore every part of the world we inhabit,

however inhospitable or difiicult of access ; and if the country claiming the
foremost place among maritime nations shrink from an undertaking because
it is perilous, other countries will not be slow to seize the post of honour. If

it be possible for man to reach the poles of the earth, whether north or south,

the feat must sooner or later be accomplished ; and the country of the success-
ful adventurers will be thereby raised in the scale of nations.

   The passage of Venus over the sun's disk is an event which cannot be

passed over without notice, although many of the circumstances connected

vrith it have already become historical. It was to observe this rare astro-
nomical phenomenon, on the occasion of its former occurrence iu 1769, that
Captain Cook's memorable voyage to the Pacific was undertaken, in the

course of which he explored the coast of New South Wales, and added that

great country to the possessions of the British Crown.
   As the transit of Venus gives the most exact method of calculating the

distance of the earth from the sun, extensive preparations were made on the

--last occasion for observing it at selected stations from Siberia in northern,

to Kerguclen's Land in southern latitudes. The great maritime powers vied
"^^dth each other to turn the opportuuity to the best account; and Lord
Lindsay had the spirit to equip, at his own expense, the most complete ex-
pedition which left the shores of this country. Some of the most valuable
stations iu southern latitudes were desert islands, rarely free from mist or
tempest, and without harbours or shelter of any kind. The landing of the
instruments was in many cases attended with great diihculty and even per-
sonal risk. Photography lent its aid to record automatically the progress of
the transit ; and M. Janssen contrived a revolving plate, by means of which
IVom fifty to sixty images of the edge of the sun could be taken at short
intervals during the critical periods of the phenomenon.

   The observations of il. Janssen at Nagasaki, in Japan, were of special
interest. Looking through a violet-blue glass he saw Ycnus, two or three
minutes before the transit began, having the appearance of a pale round spot
near the edge of the sun. Immediately after contact the segment of tho
planet's disk, as seen en the face of the sun, formed with what remained of
this spot a complete circle. The pale spot when first seen was, in short, a
partial eclipse of the solar corona, which was thus proved beyond dispute to
be a luminous atmosphere surrounding the sun. Indications were at the
same time obtained of the existence of an atmosphere around Tonus.

   The mean distance of the earth from the sun was long supposed to have

been fixed within a very small limit of error at about 95,000,000 miles.
The accuracy of this number had already been called in question on thco-
!

rclical grounds by Hansen and Leverrier, -wiiou Foucault, in 1802, decided
the question by an experiment of extraordinary delicacy. Taking advantage
of the revolving-mirror, with which Wheatstono had some time before
enriched the physical sciences, Foucault succeeded in measuring the absolute
velocity of light in space by experiments on a beam of light, reflected
backwards and forwards, within a tube little more than thrrtcen feet in
length. Combining the result thus obtained with what is called by astrono-
mers the constant of aberration, Foucault calculated the distance of the earth
from the sun, and found it to be one thirtieth part, or about 3,000,000 miles,
less than the commonly received number. This conclusion has lately been
confirmed by 31. Cornu, from a new determination he has made of the
velocity of light according to the method of Fizeau ; and in complete accord-
ance with these results are the investigations of Leverrier, founded on a
comparison with theory of the observed motions of the sun and of the
planets Tonus and Mars. It remains to be seen whether the recent obser-
vations of the transit of Yenus, when reduced, will be sufficiently concordant
to fix with even greater precision the true distance of the earth from the

sun.

    In this brief reference to one of the finest results of modern science,
I have mentioned a great name whose loss England has recently had to
deplore, and in connexion with it the name of an illustrious physicist whose
premature death deprived France, a few years ago, of one of her brightest

--ornaments Vhcatstone and Foucault, over to be remembered for their

marvellous power of eliciting, like Galileo and Newton, from familiar
phenomena the highest truths of nature

    The discovery of Huggins that some of the fixed stars are moving to-
wards and others receding from our system, has been fully confirmed by
a careful scries of observations lately made by Mr. Christie in the Observa-
tory of Greenwich. Mr. Huggins has not been able to discover any indications

of a proper motion in the nebulas ; but this may arise from the motion of
translation being less than the method would discover. Few achievements

iu the history of science are more \^-onderful than the measurement of the
proper motions of the fixed stars, from observing the relative position of two

delicate lines of light in the field of the telescope.

    The observation of the American astronomer Young, that bright lines,
corresponding to the ordinary lines of Fraunhofer reversed, may be seen in
the lower strata of the solar atmosphere for a few moments during a total
eclipse, has been confirmed by Mr. Stone, on the occasion of the total eclipse
of tho sun which occurred some time ago in South Africa. In the outer

corona, or higher regions of the sun's atmosphere, a single green line only

was seen, the same which had been already described by Y^oung.
    I can here refer only in general terms to the observations of lloscoe and

Schuster on the absorption-bands of potassium and sodium, and to the in-

vestigations of Lockycr on the absoiptivc powers of metallic and metalloidal

vapours at difForeut temperatures. From the vapour of calcium the latter

lias obtained two wholly difstinct spectrn, one belonging to a low, and the

other to a high temperature. Mr. Lockyer is also engaged on a new and

greatly extended map of the solar spectrum.

  --Spectrum analysis has lately led to the discovery of a new metal gallium

--the fifth whose presence has been first indicated bj'' that powerful agent.

This discovery is duo to M. Lccoq dc Boisbaudran, already favourably known

by a work on the application of the spectroscope to chemical analysis.

cannot occupy a few moments of your time more usefully than by briefly

referring to the subject. So recently as 1 860 the most remarkable meteoric

fall on record, not even excepting that of L'Aigle, occurred near the village of

New Concord in Ohio. On a day when no thunder-clouds were visible, loud

sounds were heard resembling claps of thunder, followed by a large fall of

meteoric stones, some of which were distinctly seen to strike the earth. One

stone, above 50 pounds in weight, buried itself to the depth of two feet in

the ground, and when dug out was found to be still warm. In 1872 another

remarkable meteorite, at first seen as a brilliant star with a luminous train,

burst near Orvinio in Itah', and six fragments of it were afterwards collected.

Isolated masses of metallic iron, or rather of an alloy of iron and nickel,

similar in composition and properties to the iron usually diffused in

meteoric stones, have been found here and there on the surface of the

earth, some of large size, as one described by Pallas, which weighed about

two thirds of a ton. Of the meteoric origin of these masses of iron there

is little room for doubt, although no record exists of their fall. Sir Edward

Sabine, whose life has been devoted with rare fidelity to the pursuit of

science, and to whose imtiring efforts this Association largelj' owes the

position it now occupies, was the pioneer of the newer discoveries in meteoric

science. Eight and fifty years ago he visited with Captain Eoss the northern

shores of Baffin's Bay, and made the interesting discovery that the knife-

blades used by the Es{}uimaux in the vicinity of the Arctic highlands were

formed of meteoric iron. This observation was afterwards fully confirmed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

and scattered blocks of meteoric iron have been found from time to time

around BnfHu's Bay. But it was not till 1870 that the meteoric treasures

of Baffin's Bay were truly discovered. In that year Nordenskiold found, at

a part of tlie shore difficult of oppruach even in moderate weather, enor-

mous blocks of meteoric iron, the Inrgest weighing nearly twenty tons, im-

bedded in a ridge of basoliie rock. The interest of this observation is greatly

enhanced by the circumstance that these masses of meteoric iron, like tha

basalt with which they are associated, do net belong to the present geologi-

cal epoch, l)ut must have fallen long before the actual arrangement of land

and sea existed,-- during, in short, the middle Tertiary, or Miocene period of
         ADDiirss.                                                  Ixxiii

Lycli. TIio uictooric origin of these iron niasscs from Ovifak has Leen

called in question by Lawrence Smith ; and it is no douht possible tliat they

may have been raised by upheaval from the interior of the earth. I have

indeed myself shown by a magucto-chemical process tluit metallic iron, in

particles so fine that they have never yet been actnally seen, is everywhere

diffused through the Miocene basalt of Slieve Mish in Antrim, and may

likewise be discovered by careful search in almost all igneous and in many

raetamorphic rocks. These observations have since been verified by lleuss in

the case of the Bohemian basalts. But, as regards the native iron of Ovifak,

the weight of evidence appears to be in favour of the conclusion, at which M.

--Daubree, after a careful discussion of the subject, has arrived that it is

really of meteoric origin. This Ovifak iron is also remarkable from con-

taining a considerabe amount of carbon, partly combined with the iron,

partly diffused through the metallic mass in a form resembling coke. In

connexion with this subject, I must refer to the able and exhaustive memoirs

of Maskelync on the Bust! and other aerolites, to the discovery of vanadium

by E. Apjohn in a meteoric iron, to the interesting observations of Sorby,

and to the researches of Daubree, Wohler, Lawrence Smith, Tschermak, and

others.

The important services which the Tvew Observatory has rendered to

meteorology and to solar physics have been fuUy recognized ; and Mr. Gassiot

has had the gratification of witnessing the final success of his long and

Anoble efforts to place this observatory upon a permanent footing.  phy-

sical observatory for somewhat similar objects, but on a larger scale, is in
course of erection, under the guidance of M. .Janssen, at Fontenay in France,
and others are springing up or already exist in Germany and Italy. It is

earnestly to be hoped that this country will not lag behind in providing

phj'sical observatories on a scale worthy of the nation and commensurate

Avith the importance of the object. On this question I cannot do better

than refer to the high authority of Dr. Balfour Stewart, and to the views he

expressed in his able address last year to the Pliysical Section.

Weather telegraphy, or the reporting by telegraph the state of the weather

at selected stations to a central office, so that notice of the probable approacli

of storms may be given to tlie seaports, has become in this country an

organized system ; and considering the little progress meteorology has made
as a science, the results may be considered to be on the whole satisfactory. Of

tlie warnings issued of late years, four out of five were justified by the

occurrence of gales or strong winds. Few storms occurred for which no

warnings had been given ; but unfortunately among these were some of the
licaviest gales of the period. The stations from which daily reports are sent

to the meteorological office in London cmbi'ace the whole coast of "Western

l']urope, including the Shetland Isles. It ajipears that atmospheric disturb-

ances seldom cross the Atlantic without being greatly altered in charncter,
Ixxiv  --BEPOET 1876.

and that the origin of most of our storms lies eastward of the longitude of
Newfoundland.

   As regards the velocity of the wind, the cup-anemometer of Dr. Robinson
has fully realized the expectations of its discoverer ; and the venerable
astronomer of Armagh has been engaged during the past summer, with all

the ardour of youth, in a course of laborious experiments to determine the

constants of his instrument. From seven years' observations at the Observa-
tory of Armagh, he has found that the mean velocity of the wind is

greatest in the S.S.W. octant and least in the opposite one, and that the

araouut of wind attains a masimum in Januarj^, after which it steadily

decreases, with one slight exception, till July, augmenting again till the end

of the year.
    Passing to the subject of electricity, it is Vv"ith pleasui'e that I have to

announce the failure of a recent attempt to deprive Oerstedt of his great
discovery. It is gratifying thus to find high reputations vindicated, and

names which all men love to honour transmitted with undimiuished lustre
to posterity. At a former meeting of this Association, remarkable for an

unusual attendance of distinguished foreigners, the central figui'e was
Oerstedt. On that occasion Sir John Hcrschel in glowing language compared
Oerstedt's discovery to the blessed dew of heaven which only the master-
mind could draw down, but which it was for others to turn to account and
use for the fertilization of the earth. To Franklin, Volta, Coulomb, Oerstedt,

Ami)cre, Faraday, Seebeck, and Ohm arc due the fundamental discoveries of

--modern electricity a science whose applications in Davy's hands led to

grander results than alchemist ever dreamed of, and in the hands of others

(among whom Wheatstone, Morse, and Thomson occupy the foremost place) to

the marvels of the electric telegraph. "When we proceed from the actual
phenomena of electricity to the molecular conditions upon which those
phenomena depend, we are confronted with questions as recondite as any
with which the physicist has had to deal, but towards the solution of which
the researches of Faraday have contributed the most precious materials. The

theory of electrical and magnetic action occupied formerly the powerful minds
of Poisson, Green, and Gauss ; and among the living it will surely not be

invidious to cite the names of Weber, Helmholtz, Thomson, and Clerk Max-
well. The work of the latter on electricity is an original essay worthy in
every way of the great reputation and of the clear and far-seeing intellect

of its author.

   Among recent investigations I must refer to Professor Tait's discovery of

consecutive neutral points in certain thermo-electric junctions, for which he
was lately awarded the Keith prize. This discovery has been^the residt of
an elaborate investigation of the properties of thermo-electric currents, and
is specially interesting in reference to the theory of dynamical electricity.
Nor can I omit to mention the very interesting and original experiments of
          --

ADDEESS.  IXXV

Dr. Kerr on the dielectric state, from -which it appears that when electricity

of high tension is passed through dielectrics, a change of molecular arrange-
ment occurs, slowly in the case of solids, quickly in the case of li(]uids, and
that the lines of electric force are in some cases lines of compression, in

other cases lines of extension.

   Of the many discoveries in physical science due to Sir William Grove,

the earliest and not the least important is the hattery which hears his name,
and is to this day the most powerful of all voltaic arrangements ; but with a
Grove's battery of 50 or even 100 cells in vigorous action, the spark will not
pass through an appreciable distance of cold air. By using a very large
number of cells, carefully insulated and charged with water, IMr. Gassiot

succeeded in obtaining a short spark through air ; and lately De La Eue and

MiiUer have constructed a large chloride-of-silver battery giving freely sparks

through cold air, which, when a column of pure water is interposed in
the circuit, accurately resemble those of the common electrical machine.
The length of the spark increasing nearly as the square of the number

of cells, it has been calculated that with 100,000 elements of this battery
the discharge should take place through a distance of no less than eight

feet in air.

   In the solar beam we have an agent of surpassing power, the investiga-
tion of whose properties by Newton forms an epoch in the history of experi-

mental science scarcely less important than the discovery of the law of
gravitation in the history of physical astronomy. Three actions chaiacterize

--the solar beam, or, indeed, more or less that of any luminous body the

heating, the physiological, and the chemical. In the ordinary solar beam
we can modify the relative amount of these actions by passing it through
dilferent media, and we cau thus have luminous rays with little heating or

little chemical action. In the case of the moon's rays it required the highest
skill on the part of Lord Eosse, even with all the resources of the observatory
of Parsonstown, to investigate their heating properties, and to show that the
surface of our satellite facing the earth passes, during every lunation, through
a greater range of temperature than the difference between the freezing- and

boiling-points of water.

   But if, instead of taking an ordinary ray of light, wc analyze it as Kewton

did by the prism, and isolate a very fine line of the spectrum (thcoreticallj' a

line of infinite tenuity), that is to say, if wo take a ray of definite refrangi-

bility, it will be found impossible by screens or otherwise to alter its pro-
perties. It was his clear perception of the truth of this princii)le that led
Stokes to his great discovery of the cause of epipolic dispersion, in which he

showed that many bodies had the power of absorbing dark rays of high

refrangibility and of emitting them as luminous rays of lower refrangibility
of absorbing, in short, darkness and of emitting it as light. It is not,
indeed, an easy matter in all cases to say whether a given effect is due to
Ixxvi  --KEPORT 18/6,

the action of licat or light; and the question M'hich of these forces is the
efficient agent in causing the motion of the tiny disks in Crookes's radiometer
has given rise to a good deal of discussion. The answer to this question in-
volves the same principles as those bj'which the image traced on the dnguerrco-
type i)late, or the decomposition of carbonic acid by the leaves of plants, is
referred to the action of light and not of heat ; and applying these principles
to the experiments made Tvith the radiometer, the weight of evidence appears
to be in favour of the view that the repulsion of the blaclvcncd surfaces of
the disks is due to a thermal reaction occurring in a highly rarefied mcdiimi.

I have myself had the pleasure of -witnessiug many of Mr. Crookes's experi-
ments, and I cannot sufficientljf express my admiration of the care and skill
"with which ho has pursued this investigation. The remarkable repulsions

he has observed in the most perfect vacua hitherto attained are interesting,
not only as having led to the construction of a beautiful instrument, but as
being likely, -when the subject is fully investigated, to give valuable data for
the theory of molecular actions.

  A singular property of light, discovered a short time ago by Mr. Willoughby

Smith, is its power of diminishing the electrical resistance of the element
selenium. This property has been ascertained to belong chiefly to the luminous
rays on the red side of the spectrum, being nearly absent in the violet or
more refrangible rays and also in heat-rays of low refrangibility. The

recent experiments of Prof. W. G. Adams have fully established the accuracy
of the remarkable observation, first made by Lord llosse, that the action ap-

peared to vary inversely as the simple distance of the illuminating source.
   Switzerland sent, some years ago, as its representative to this country the

celebrated Do la Rive, whose scientific life formed lately the subject of an
eloquent f'lV/e from the pen of M. Dumas. On this occasion we have to

welcome, in Oeneral Menabrea, a distinguished representative both of the
kingdom of Italj- and of Italian science. His great work on the determina-
tion of the pressures and tensions in an elastic system is of too abstruse a

--character to be discussed in this address; but tlie principle it contains may

be briefly stated in the following words : " When any elastic sj-stem places

itself in equilibrium under the action of external forces, the work developed
by the internal forces is a minimum." General Menabrea has, however, other

and special claims upon us here, as the friend to whom Babbage entrusted the

task of making known to the world the principles of his analytical machine

-- a gigantic conception, the efibrt to realize which it is known was one of

the chief objects of Babbage's later life. The latest development of this con-
ception is to be found in the mechanical integrator of Trof. J. Thomson, in
M-hich motion is transmitted, according to a new kinematic princiiJe, from a
disk or cone to a cylinder through the intervention of a loose baU, and in
Sir ^\. Thomson's machine for the mechanical integration of differential
equations of the second order. In the exquisite tidal machine of the latter

   The attraction-meter of Siemens is an instrument of great delicacy for

measuring horizontal attractions, which it is proposed to use for recording

the attractive influences of the sun and moon, upon -which the tides depend.
The bathometer of the same able physicist is another remarkable instrument,
in which the constant force of a spring is opposed to the variable pressure of

a column of mercury. By an easy observation of the bathometer on ship-

board, the depth of the sea may be approximately ascertained without the

use of a sounding-line.

The Loan Exhibition of Apparatus at Kensington has been a eomploto

success, and cannot fail to be useful, both in extending a knowledge of

scientific subjects and in promoting scientific research throughout the country.
Unique in character, but most interesting and instructive, this exhibition

will, it is to be hoped, be tlie precursor of a permanent museum of scientific

objects, which, like the present exhibition, shall be a record of old, as well

as a representation of new inventions.

It is often difficult to draw a distinct line of separation between the phy-

sical and  chemical sciences                                                                                         and it is perhaps doubtful whether the division
                                                                                                                  ;

is not really an artificial one. The chemist cannot, indeed, make any large

advance without having to deal with physical principles; and it is to Eoyle,

Balton, Gay-Lussac, and (Jraham that we owe the discovery of the mecha-

nical laws which govern the properties of gases and vapours. Some of these
laws liave of late been made the subject of searching inqiiiry, which has

fullj- confirmed their accuracy, when the body under examination approaches

to what has not inaptly been designated the ideal gaseous state. But when

gases are examined under varied conditions of pressure and tcmperatiu-e, it
is found that these laws are only particular cases of more general laws, and

that the laws of the gaseous state, as it exists in natiire, although they may

be enunciated in a precise and definite form, are very diflferent from the

simple expressions which apply to the ideal condition. The new laws be-
come in their turn inapplicable when from the gaseous state proper wo

pass to those intei-mediate conditions which, it has been shown, link with

unbroken continuity the gaseous and liquid states. As wc approach the
liquid state, or even when we reach it, the problem becomes more com-

plicated ; but its solution even in these cases will, it may confidently be

expected, yield to the powerful means of investigation we now possess.
   Among the more important researches made of late in physical chemistrv,

I may mention those of F. Weber on the specific heat of carbon and the

allied elements, of Berthelot on thcrmo-chemistry, of Eunsen on spectrum

analysis, of Wiillner on the band- and line-spectra of the gases, and of
CUithrie on the cryohydrates.

facts of tlie highest interest. Hydrogen, which, if the ahsolute zero of the

physicist does not bar the way, we may hope yet to see in the metallic form,

appears to be everywhere present in the universe. It exists in enormous
quantity in the solar atmosphere, and it has been discovered in the atmo-

spheres of the fixed stars. It is present, and is the only known element of
whose presence we are certain, in those vast sheets of ignited gas of which
the nebulfe proper are composed. Nitrogen is also widely diffused among
the stellar bodies, and carbon has been discovered in more than one of the
comets. On the other hand, a prominent line in the spectrum of the Aui'ora
Borealis has not been identified with that of any known element ; and the

--question may be asked : Does a new element, in a highly rarefied state,

                                                                                                                                                       o

exist in the upper regions of our atmosphere? or are we with Angstrom to

attribute this line to a fluorescent or phosj^horescent light produced by the

electrical discharge to which the aurora is due ? This question awaits farther

observations before it can be definitely settled, as does also that of the source

of the remarkable green line which is everywhere conspicuous in the solar

corona.

   I must here pause for a moment to pay a passing tribute to the memory

of Angstrom, whose great work on the solar spectrum will always remain as
one of the finest monuments of the science of our period. The influence,

                                                                          O

indeed, which the labours of Angstrom and of Kirchhoff have exerted on the
most interesting portion of later physics can scarcely be exaggerated; and it

may be truly said that there are few men whose loss wUl be longer felt or

more deeply deplored than that of the illustrious astronomer of Upsala.

    I cannot pursue this subject further, nor refer to the other terrestrial

elements which are present in the solar and stellar atmospheres. Among
the many elements that make up the ordinary aerolite, not one has been
discovered which does not occur upon this earth. On the whole we arrive at

the grand conclusion that this mighty universe is chiefly built up of the same
materials as the globe wo inhabit.

   In the application of science to the useful purposes of life, chemistry and

mechanics have run an lionourable race. It was in the valley of the Clyde

that the chief industry of this country received, within the memory of many

here present, an extraordinary impulse from the application by Ncilson of
the hot blast to the smelting of iron. The Bessemer steel process and the

regcJicrativc furnace of Siemens are later appHcations of high scientific prin-
ciples to the same industry. But there is ample work yet to be done. The
fuel consumed in the manufactui'e of iron, as, indeed, in every funiace where
coal is used, is greatly in excess of what theory indicates ; and the clouds of
smoke which darken the atmosphere of our manufacturing towns, and even
of whole districts of country, are a clear indication of the waste, but only of
a small portion of the waste, arising from imperfect combustion. The de-
pressing effect of Ihifl ntinosphero upon Ihc working population can scarcely
                               ADDRESS.           Ixxix

be overrated. Their palo, I had almost said etiolated, faces are a sure indi-

cation of the absence of the vivifying influence of the solar rays, so essential

to the maintenance of vigorous health. The chemist can furnish a simple

test of this state of the atmosphere in the absence of ozone, the active form

of oxygen, from the air of our large towns. At some future day the efforts

of science to isolate, by a cheap and available process, the oxygen of the

air for industrial purposes may be rewarded with success. The effect of such

a discovery would be to reduce the consumption of fuel to a fractional part

of its present amount ; and although the carbonic acid would remain, the

smoke and carbonic oxide would disappear. But an abundant supply of puro

oxygen is not now witliin our reach ; and in the mean time may I venture to
suggest that in many localities the waste products of the furnace might be

carried off to a distance from the busy human hive hj a few horizontal flues

of large dimensions, terminating in lofty chimneys on a hillside or distant

Aplain ?  system of this kind has long been employed at the mercurial mines

of Idria, and in other smclting-works where noxious vapours are disengaged.

With a little care in the arrangements, the smoke wouH be wholly deposited,

as flue-dust or soot, in the horizontal galleries, and wonld be available for

the use of the agriculturist.

The future historian of organic chemistry will have to record a succession

of beneficent triumphs, in which the efforts of science have led to results of

the highest value to the wellbeing of man. The discovery of quinine has

probably saved more human Ufe, with the exception of that of vaccination,

than any discovery of any age ; and he who succeeds in devising an artificial

method of preparing it will be truly a benefactor of the race. Not the least

valuable, as it has been one of the most successful, of the works of our

Government in India, has been the planting of the cinchona-tree on tho

slopes of the Himalaya. As artificial methods are discovered, one by one, of

preparing the proximate principles of the useful dyes, a temporary derange-

ment of industry occurs, but in the end the waste materials of our manufac-

tures set free large portions of the soil for the production of human food.

Tho ravages of insects have ever been the terror of the agriculturist, and

Anthe injury they inflict is often incalculable.  enemy of this class, carried

over from America, threatened lately with ruin some of the finest vine

districts in the south of France. The occasion has called forth a chemist of

high renown ; and in a classical memoir recently published, M. Dumas ap-

pears to have resolved the difficult problem. His method, although immedi-

ately applied to the PJujlIoawa of the vine, is a general one, and will no

doubt be found serviceable in other cases. In the apterous state the PJti/l-

loxera attacks the roots of the plant ; and the most efficacious method hitherto
known of destroying it has been to inundate the vineyard. After a long and

patient investigation, M. Dumas has discovered that the sulphocarbonate of

potassium, in dilute solution, fulfils every condition required from an insccti-

time and patience ; but the trials in the vineyard have fully confirmed the

experiments of the laboratory.
   The application of artificial cold to practical purposes is rapidly extending

and, with the improvement of the ice-machine, the influence of this agent
upon our supply of animal food from distant countries will undoubtedly be
immense. The ice-machine is already employed in paraffin-works and in

large breweries ; and the curing or salting of meat is now largely conducted
in vast chambers, maintained throughout the summer at a constant tempera-

ture by a thick covering of ice.

   I have now completed this brief I'evicw, rendered difficult by the abun-
dance, not by the lack of materials. Even confining our attention to the

few branches of science upon which I have ventured to touch, and omitting
altogether the whole range of pure chemistry, it is with regret that I find
myself constrained to make onlj- a simple reference to the important work of
Cayley on the Mathematical Theory of Isomers, and to elaborate memoirs
which have recently appeared in Germany on the reflection of heat- and light-
rays, and on the specific heat and conducting-powcr of gases for heat, by
Knoblauch, E. "Wiedemann, "Winkelmann, and Buff.

   The decline of science in England formed the theme, fifty years ago, of nn
elaborate essay by Babbage ; but the brilliant discoveries of Faraday soon
after -wiped oft' Ihe reproach. I will not verdure to say tliat the alarm which
has lately arisen, here and elsewhere, on the same subject will prove to
be equally groundless. The duration of every great outburst of human
activity, whether in art, in literature, or in science, has always been short,
and experimental science has made gigantic advances during the last three
centuries. The evidence of any great failure is not, however, very manifest,
at least in the physical sciences. The journal of PoggcndorfF, which has long
been a faithful record of the progress of jAysical research thi'oughout the
world, shows no signs of flagging; and the Jubelband by which Germany
celebrated the fiftieth year of Poggendorff"s invaluable services was at the
sarao time an ovation to a scientific veteran, who has perhaps done more

than any man living to encourage the highest forms of research, and a proof

that in Northern Europe the physical sciences continue to be ably and
actively cultivated. If in chemistry the case is somewhat weaker, the ex-
planation, at least in this country, is chiefly to be found in the demand on

the part of the public for professional aid from many of our ablest chemists.

   But whatever view be taken of the actual condition of scientific research,
there can be no doubt that it is both the duty and the interest of the country
to encourage a pirrsuit so ennobling in itself, and fraught with such impor-
tant consequences to the weUbeing of the community. Xor is there any
question in which this Association, whose special aim is the advancement of
science, can take a deeper int( rost. Tb.o public rnii'd has also been awakened
       ADDRESS.                                    Ixxxi

to its importance, and is prcjiared to aid in carrying out any proposal which

offers a reasonable prospect of advantage.

In its recent phase the question of scientific research has been mixed up

with contemplated changes in the great universities of England, and par-

ticularly in the University of Oxford. The national interests involved on
aU sides are immense, and a false step once taken may be irretrievable. It

is with diffidence that I now refer to the subject, even after having given to

it the most anxious and careful consideration.

As regards the higher mathematics, their cultivation has hitherto been

chiefly confined to the Universities of Cambridge and Dublin, and two great

mathematical schools will probably be sufficient for the kingdom. The case

of the physical and natural sciences is different, and they ought to be cul-

tivated in the largest and widest sense at every complete university. Nor,

in applying this remark to the English universities, must we forget that if

Cambridge was the alma mater of Newton and Cavendish, Oxford gave birth

to the Eoyal Society. The ancient renown of Oxford will surely uot suffer,

while her material position cannot fail to be strengthened, by the expansion

of scientific studies and the encoiiragement of scientific research within her

walls. Nor ought such a proposal to be regarded as in any way hostUo to

the literary studies, and especially to the ancient classical studies, which

have always been so carefully cherished at Oxford. If, indeed, there were

--any such risk, few would hesitate to exclaim let science shift elsewhere for

herself, and let literature and philosophy find shelter in Oxford ! But there

is no ground for any such anxiety. Literature and science, philosophy and

art, when properly cultivated, far from opposing, will mutually aid one

another. Tliere will be ample room for aU, and, by judicious an-angements,

all may receive the attention they deserve.

  A University, or Studium Generale, ought to embrace in its arrangements

the whole circle of studies which involve the material interests of society, as

well as those which cultivate intellectual refinement. The industries of the

country should look to the universities for the development of the principles

of applied as well as of abstract science ; and in this respect no institutions

have ever had so grand a possession within easy reach as have the univer-

sities of England at this conjuucture, if only they have the courage to seize it.

"With their historic reputation, their coUegiate endowments, their command-

ing influence, Oxford and Cambridge should continue to be all that they now

are ; but they should, moreover, attract to their lecture-halls and working

cabinets students in large numbers preparing for the higher industrial piu--

suits of the country. The great physical laboratory in Cambridge, founded

and equipped by the noble representative of the House of Cavendish, has in

this respect a peculiar significance, and is an important step in the direction

I have indicated. But a small number only of those for whom this temple

of science is designed are now to be found in Cambridge. It remains for the

1876.                                           /

University to perform its part, and to widen its portals so that tlie nation at

large may reap the advantage of this well-timed foundation.

    If the Universities, in accordance with the spirit of theu- statutes, or at
least of ancient usage, would demand from the candidates for some of the
higher degrees proof of original powers of investigation, they would give an

important stimulus to the cultivation of science. The example of many con-
tinental universities, and among others of the venerable University of Leyden,
may here be mentioned. Two proof essays recently written for the degree
of Doctor of Science in Leyden, one by Van der Waals, the other by Lorenz,
are works of unusual merit ; and another pupil of Professor Eijke is now

engaged in an elaborate experimental research as a qualification for the same

degree.

   The endowment of a body of scientific men devoted exclusively to original

research, without the duty of teaching or other occupation, has of late been

strongly advocated in this country ; and M. Fremy has given the weight of
his high authority to a somewhat similar proposal for the encouragement of

research in France. I will not attempt to discuss the subject as a national
question, the more so as after having given the proposal the most careful

consideration in my power, and turned it round on every side, I have failed

to discover how it could be worked so as to secure the end in view.
   But whatever may be said in favour of the endowment of pure research as

a national question, the Universities ought surely never to be asked to give
their aid to a measure which would separate the higher intellects of the country
from the flower of its youth. It is only through the influence of original
minds that any great or enduring impression can be produced on the hopeful

student. . Without original power, and the habit of exercising it, you may
have an able instructor, but you cannot have a great teacher. No man can

be expected to train others in habits of observation and thought he has never
acquired himself. In every age of the world the great schools of learning
have, as in Athens of old, gathered around great and original minds, and

never more conspicuously than in the modem schools of chemistry, which

reflected the genius of Liebig, Wohler, Bunscn, and Hofmann. These
 schools have been nurseries of original research as well as models of scientific
 teaching ; and students attracted to them from all countries became enthu-
 siastically devoted to science, while they learned its methods from example
 even more than from precept. "Will any one have the courage to assert that
 organic chemistry, with its many applications to the uses of mankind, would
 have made in a few short years the marvellous strides it has done, if Science,
 now as in mediaeval times, had pursued her work in strict seclusion,

                                   SeiDota ab nostris rebus, seiunctaque longe,
                                   Ipsa suis pollens opibus, nil indiga nostri ?

But while the Universities otight not to apply their resources in support
ADDRESS.  Ixxxiii

 of a measure -vrhich would render their teaching ineffective, and would at the
 same time dry up the springs of intellectual growth, they ought to admit

 freely to university positions men of high repute from other universities, and

 even without academic qualifications. An honorary degree does not neces-

 sarily imply a university education ; but if it have any meaning at all, it

 implies that he who has obtained it is at least on a level with the ordinary

 graduate, and should be eligible to university positions of the highest trust.
    Not less important would it be for the encouragement of learning

tkroughout the country that the English Universities, remembering that
they were founded for the same objects, and derive their authority from a

common source, should be j^repared to recognize the ancient universities of

 Scotland as freely as they have always recognized the Elizabethan University
of Dublin. Such a measure would invigorate the whole university system
 of the country more than any other I can think of. It would lead to
the strengthening of the literary element in the northern, and of the
practical element in the southern universities, and it would bring the highest
teaching of the country everywhere more fully into harmony with the

requirements of the times in which we live. As an indirect result, it could

not fail to give a powerful impulse to literary pursuits as well as to scientific
investigations. Professors would be promoted from smaller positions in
one university to higher positions in another, after they had given proofs
of industry and ability ; and stagnation, hurtful alike to professorial and
professional life, would be effectually prevented. If this union were estab-

lished among the old universities, and if at the same time a new univer-

sity (as I myself ten years ago earnestly proposed) were founded on sound
principles amidst the great populations of Lancashire and Yorkshire, the
university system of the country would gradually receive a large and useful
extension, and, without losing any of its present valuable characteristics,
would become more intimately related than hitherto with those great indus-
tries upon which mainly depend the strength and wealth of the nation.

   It may perhaps appear to many a paradoxical assertion to maintain that

the industries of the country should look to the calm and serene regions

of Oxford and Cambridge for help in the troublous times of which we
have now a sharp and severe note of warning. But I have not spoken

on light grounds, nor without due consideration. If Great Britain is to
retain the commanding position she has so long occupied in skilled manu-
facture, the easy ways which (owing partly to the high qualities of her
people, partly to the advantages of her insular position and mineral wealth)
have sufficed for the past, will not be found to suffice for the future.
The highest training which can be brought to bear on practical science
will be imperatively required ; and it will be a fatal policy if that training
is to be sought for in foreign lands, because it cannot be obtained at home.
The country which depends unduly on the stranger for the education of

                                                                        /2

its skilled men, or neglects in its highest places this primary duty, may ex-

pect to find the demand for such skill gradually to pass away, and along

with it the industry for which it was wanted. I do not claim for scien-

tific education more than it will accomijlish, nor can it ever replace the

after- training of the workshop or factory. Rare and powerful minds have,

it is true, often been independent of it ; but high education always gives an

enormous advantage to the country where it prevails. Let no one suppose

I am now referring to elementary instruction, and much less to the active

work which is going on everywhere around us, in preparing for examina-

tions of all kinds.  These things are all very useful  in  their  way                        but it is
                                                                                          ;

not by them alone that the practical arts are to be sustained in the country.

It is by education in its highest sense, based on a broad scientific founda-

--tion, and leading to the application of science to practical purposes in itself

one of the noblest pursuits of the human mind--that this result is to be

reached. That education of this kind can be most eff'ectively given in a

university, or in an institution like the Polytechnic School of Ziirich, which

differs from the scientific side of a university only in name, and to a large

extent supplements the teaching of an actual university, I am firmly con-

vinced ; and for this reason, among others, I have always deemed the estab-
lishment in this country of Examining Boards with the power of granting

degrees, but with none of the higher and more important functions of a

university, to have been a measure of questionable utility. It is to Oxford

and Cambridge, widely extended as they can readily be, that the country

should chiefly look for the development of practical science ; they have abun-
dant resources for the task ; and if they wish to secure and strengthen their

lofty position, they can do it in no way so effectually as by showing that in

a green old age they preserve the vigour and elasticity of youth.

If any are disposed to think that I have been carrying this meeting into

dream-land, let them pause and listen to the result of similar efforts to those

I have been advocating, undertaken by a neighbouring country when on the

verge of ruin, and steadily pursued by the same country in the climax of its
prosperity. " The University of Berlin," to use the words of Hofmann,

*' like her sister of Bonn, is a creation of our century. It was founded in

the year 1810, at a period when the pressure of foreign domination weighed

almost insupportably on Prussia ; and it will ever remain significant of the

direction of the German mind that the great men of that time should have

hoped to develop, by high intellectual training, the forces necessary for the

regeneration of their country." It is not for me, especially in this place, to

dwell upon the great strides which Northern Germany has made of late years

in some of the largest branches of industry, and particularly in those which

give a free scope for the application of scientific skill. " Let us not sup-

pose," says M. "VVurtz in his recent report on the Artificial Dyes, " that

the distance is so great between theory and its industrial applications. This
                        ADDRESS.                                   IXXXV

report would have been written in vain, if it had not brought clearly into

view the immense influence of pure science upon the progress of industry.

If unfortunately the sacred flame of science should burn dimly or be extin-

guished, the practical arts would soon fall into rapid decay. The outlay

which is incurred by any country for the promotion of science and of high

instruction will yield a certain return ; and Germany has not had long to wait

for the ingathering of the fruits of her far-sighted policy. Thirty or forty

years ago, industry could scarcely be said to exist there ; it is now widely
spread and successful." As an illustration of the truth of these remarks, I

may refer to the newest of European industries, but one which in a short

space of time has attained considerable magnitude. It appears (and I make

the statement on the authority of M. Wurtz) that the artificial dyes produced

last year in Germany exceeded in value those of all the rest of Europe, in-

cluding England and France. Yet Germany has no special advantage for

Wethis manufacture except the training of her practical chemists.  are not,

it is true, to attach undue importance to a single case ; but the rapid growth

of other and larger industries points in the same direction, and will, I trust,

secure some consideration for the suggestions I have ventured to make.

The intimate relations which exist between abstract science and its appli-

cations to the uses of life have always been kept steadily in view by this

Association, and the valuable Reports, which are a monument to the indiistry

and zeal of its members, embrace every part of the domain of science. It is

with the greater confidence, therefore, that I have ventured to suggest from

this Chair that no partition wall should anywhere be raised up between pure

and applied science. The same sentiment animates our vigorous ally, the

French Association for the Advancement of Science, which rivalling, as it

already does, this Association in the high scientific character of its proct^ed-

ings, bids fair in a few years to call forth the same interest in science and its

results, throughout the great provincial towns of France, which the Erilish

Association may justly claim to have already efi'ected in this country. No

better proof can be given of the wide base upon which the French Associa-

tion rests, than the fact that it was presided over last year by an able repre-

sentative of commerce and industry, and this year by one who has long

held an exalted position in the world of science, and has now the rare di-

stinction of representing in her historic Academies the literature as well as

the science of France.

Whatever be the result of our efforts to advance science and industry, it

requires no gift of prophecy to declare that the boundless resources which

the supreme Author and Upholder of the Universe has provided for the use

of man will, as time rolls on, be more and more fully applied to the im-

provement of the physical and, through the improvement of the i)hysical, to

the elevation of the moral condition of the human family. Unless, however,

the history of the future of our race be wholly at variance with the hi&tory

of the past, the progress of mankind will be marlced by alternate periods

of activity and repose ; nor will it be the work of any one nation or of

any one race. To the erection of the edifice of civilized life, as it now

exists, all the higher races of the world have contributed ; and if the balance

were accurately struck, the claims of Asia for her portion of the work would

be immense, and those of Northern Africa not insignificant. Steam-power

has of late years produced greater changes than probably ever occurred be-

fore in so short a time. But the resources of Nature are not confined to

steam, nor to the combustion of coal. The steady water-wheel and the rapid

turbine  are  more  perfect  machines  than  the  stationary  steam-engine                                                          and
                                                                                                                                 ;

glacier-fed rivers with natural reservoirs, if fully turned to account, would

supply an unlimited and nearly constant source of power depending solely

for its continuance upon solar heat. But no immediate dislocation of indus-

try is to be feared, although the turbine is already at work on the Rhine and

the Ehone. In the struggle to maintain their high position in science and its

applications, the countrymen of Newton and Watt will have no ground for

alarm so long as they hold fast to their old traditions, and remember that

the greatest nations have fallen when they relaxed in those habits of intelli-

gent and steady industry upon which all permanent success depends.

Twelfth Report of the Committee for Exploring Kent's Cavern,

   Devonshire, the Committee consisting of John Evans, F.R.S., Sir
   John Lubbock, Bart., F.R.S., Edward Vivian, M.A., George
  Busk, F.R.S., William Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., William Aysh-
  FORD Sanford, F.G.S., John Edward Lee, F.G.S., and William
   Pengelly, F.R.S. (Reporter).

The Eleventh Eeport, presented by the Committee to the Association during

the Meeting at Bristol in 1875, and read to the Geological Section *, brought

up the narrative of the exploration to the end of July of that year. From

that date the work, which is still in progress, has been carried on uninter-

ruptedly, in all respects as in previous years ; and it is intended in the
present Report to describe the researches made during the thirteen months
ending 31st of August of the present year.

    Though the Committee have still the satisfaction of stating that they retain
the valuable services of George Smerdon, foreman of the work, they have to add
that Nicholas Luscombe, who had been engaged a short time before the Eleventh
Report was drawn up, was obliged to leave very soon afterwards on account of
illness, and that there was some difficulty in supplying his place, there being
a great demand for labourers at Torquay. At the beginning of September,

however, they engaged a young man named AVilliam Matthews, who has

given complete satisfaction, and is still at work in the Cavern.

   The Superintendents have had the pleasure, as in former years, of con-
ducting a large number of persons into the Cavern, of explaining to them on
the spot the mode of working, and describing the facts which have been dis-

covered, as well as of settiug forth their bearing on Palasontology and

--Anthropology. The following may be mentioned as amongst the visitors since

the Eleventh Eeport was presented : Lord Erskine, Hon. J. C. Erskine, Sir

J. L. Duntze, Sir L. Palk, Sir J. Walroud, Colonel Eridges, Colonel Buckle
(Bangalore), Major Lang, Captain F. G. D. Watson, the Eevds. Chancellor

been attended by the " Guid*e," i. e. the foreman of the work, under arrange-
ments laid down by the Superintendents.

  --The Great Overu Your Committee stated last year that on the 27th of July,

1875 (five days before their Eleventh Eeport was drawn up), they began the
exploration of the small passage or tunnel known as " The Great Oven,"
which connects with one another " The Cave of Inscriptions " and " The

Bear's Den," the two remotest chambers of the Cavern. The Great Oven may

 be said to consist of three Beaches, the Eastern, Central, and Western, all of
 them, and especially the Central, being very contracted in height and width.
 The Western Eeach (the only one which has been explored) extends tortuously,
 from its commencement in the south-west corner of the Cave of Inscriptions
 towards E.S.E., for a distance of 58 feet, where it is succeeded by the Central
 Eeach, and throws oft' two branches, one in a northerly and the other in a
 southerly direction. At its mouth, or junction with the Cave of Inscriptions,
 it is 8 feet high from the limestone roof to the bottom of the usual four-feet
 excavation made by the Committee. Its width is commonly about 4 feet
 but at one point it contracts to 3 feet, and at another expands to 7 feet.
 Throughout its entire length, and especially at and near the entrance, the

 roof and walls have the aspect of a well-worn watercourse. A few small

 lateral ramifications open out of the walls, almost all of them being quite

 empty and well worn by the action of flowing water. How far they extend

  cannot be determined, as they are too narrow for investigation.
     In the Western Eeach of the Great Oven there was no continuous Floor of

 Stalagmite, though here and there portions of such a floor, perhaps never
  continuous, adhered to and projected from the walls ; and pieces of stalagmite,
 as well as detached " Paps " of the same material, occurred in the deposit
 below. There was no reason to suppose that earlier explorers had ever

 worked in this branch of the Cavern.
     As in the adjacent chambers and galleries, the deposits consisted of a thin

 layer of " Cave-earth " above, and "Breccia" below ; and throughout the Eeach

  the one lay immediately on the other, without any intermediate Crystalline
  Stalagmite, such as occurs in typical sections. At the entrance, and up to

  34 feet from it, the usual four-feet sections failed to reach the bottom of tho
  Breccia, so that its depth is undetei mined; but at the point just named,

  the limestone floor was found at a depth of 3"5 feet below the upper siirface
 of the Cave-earth ; and thence to the inner end of the Eeach the floor was

  found everywhere at a depth of 4 feet at most, and frequently at but little

 --more than 2 feet, thus displaying a continuous Limestone Floor for a length

  of 24 feet a fact without a parallel in the history of the exploration. At the

  innermost end the height of the Eeach was 8*5 feet, from Limestone Eoof to
  Limestone Floor. The upper surface of the Cave-eaith was an irregularly

  inclined plane, ascending 8 feet from the entrance inwards, or rising at a

  mean gradient of about 1 in 7 ; whilst the Limestone Floor was inclined in the
  same direction at a higher mean gradient and with still greater irregulai'ity.
ON KENT^S CAVERN^ DEVONSHIRE.  3

     The discoveries in this branch of the Cavern were neither numerous nor
 important. The total number of " finds," inchiding the few mentioned in the
 Eleventh Eeport, amounted to 50. The remains found in the Cave-earth
  included 2 teeth of HyaeHa, 6 of Eear, 10 of Ox, 1 plate of a small molar of
 Mammoth, several bones and pieces of bone, including an astragalus of Horse,
 a few coprolites of Hyaena, a portion of a flint flake (No. 6672), and a flint

 chip (No. 6661).

     The flint flake (No. 6672) is of a pretty uniform cream-colour, almost a

 parallelogram in outline, 1-4 inch long, -7 inch broad, abruptly terminated at
 each end, one of which retains the original surface of the nodule from which

 it was struck, and -3 inch in greatest thickness, which it attains near the
 butt end. The inner face is slightly concave; the outer is very convex,
 and consists of three planes or facets, the central one commencing near the
 butt end, whilst those on each side of it extend the entire length of the flake.
 Its ridges and (excepting a very few smaU notches) its lateral edges are quite
 sharp, and show that it can have had little or no wear and tear in any way,
 and that in all probability it reached the spot in which it was found, not by

 the transporting action of water, but by human agency ; in short, that man

 intentionally took it to, or accidentally left it in, one of the brajiches of the

 Cavern most remote from the known external entrances. It occurred with
 chips of bone, within a foot of the upper surface of the Cave-earth, 40 feet
from the mouth of the Great Oven, on 13th October, 1875.

    The specimens found in the Breccia were 8 teeth of Bear and a few bones,
none of which call for special description.

    Besides the foregoing, there were 2 teeth of Bear and some bones and pieces
of bone found at and near the junction of the two deposits, where, there
being no separating stalagmite, it was not always easy to determine whether
they belonged to the Cave-earth or to the Breccia, without trusting entirely
to the mineral characters of the specimens themselves.

    The Central or most contracted Eeach, that from which the Great Oven
more especially takes its name, is a perfectly empty tunnel, of elliptical

transverse section, about 2-75 feet high and 325 feet wide, with roof and

walls and floor so strikingly smooth as to denote a weU-worn and completely

fiUed watercourse, extending through the limestone in an easterly direction
for a distance of 20 feet, where it is succeeded by the Eastern Eeach, which
finally terminates in the Bear's Den, whence its exploration can alone be

undertaken.

   The two branches which the "Western Eeach throws off at its inner end,

one on each side of the Central Eeach, are filled with deposits from roof to
floor ; but as they are, at least at their entrances, very contracted in both
height and breadth, as the deposits they contain form a most intractable
concrete, and as the specimens found in their vicinity were comparatively
few and unimportant, the Superintendents closed their attempts to explore

them, at least for the present, and left the Great Oven on 27th October,
1875, having spent about three months on it.

  --Tlie Labyrinth. Three branches of the Cavern, known as " The Charcoal

Cave," " Underhay's Gallery," and " The Labyrinth," open out of the left or
eastern wall of " The Long Arcade," described in previous Eeports *. The
first two have been explored and reported onf; but the Committee had
undertaken no researches in the Labyrinth, the innermost and most important

of them, -when the Eleventh Eeport was presented. When Mr. MacEnery

and his contemporaries commenced their labours in the Cavern, the existence

of this chamber was probably known to but very few persons, as what

appeared to be its two entrances must have been so nearly filled with deposits

of different kinds as to reduce them to the size of mere pigeon -holes ; and it

is perhaps worthy of remark, by way of confii'mation, that though it contained

large and lofty bosses of stalagmite, such as visitors loved to enrich with

their names or initials, the only inscription found in it is dated many years

after the commencement of Mr. MacEnery's researches.

The entrance to the Labyrinth is about 190 feet from the mouth of the

Long Arcade, and 280 feet from the nearest external entrance to the Cavern.

The name of Labyrinth was given to it on account of the difficulty which,
without a guide, visitors experienced in threading their way between the

numerous masses of fallen limestone and the large bosses of stalagmite which

occupied its floor. In fact it was not only the most bewildering branch of the

Cavern, but even persons somewhat familiar with the scene so constantly
" lost their bearings " as to be unable, even after emerging from it, to tell

whether their way out of the Cavern lay to the right hand or to the left.

" There was," says Mr. MacEnery, " a tradition of the loss of life here by a

young man who ventured to explore it without a guide. It is certain that

two gentlemen who lost their light and way spent a night of horror here,

dreading to advance for fear of falling into the pits .... they remained im-

movable until their friends came to their relief, alarmed by their absence " *.

   In another passage, speaking of the Labj-rinth as " The Zigzag Eoute,"
he says, " Of the dangerous intricacies of this section of the Cavern a memo-

rable and nearly fatal illustration occurred during the American War. Some

officers of the fleet then stationed in Torbay had the hardihood to attempt to

explore it without a guide. Having lost their clue, they wandered about in

the vain hope of retracing their steps, during which their torches were burnt

out. They then groped about in different directions and separated. After a

night .of horror they were released by their friends, who, alarmed at their

absence, recollected the projected adventure and hastened to their deliver-

ance "t.

The Labyrinth extends from the Long Arcade, in a south-easterly direction,

for about 46 feet, throwing off three narrow branches at and near its inner

end. Of these, the central one, opening out of the south-eastern corner, and

which it is proposed to call " Matthews's Passage," after one of the workmen,

leads into  the  Bear's  Den                       another,  the  mouth  of which  is  immediately
                                                ;

adjacent and opens out of the north-eastern wall, has long been famous as

" The Little Oven," and has its other end on the mass of limestone known as

" The Bridge "t, at a distance of upwards of 60 feet towards the north ; whilst

the third, commencing in the southernmost corner, extends for a distance of

at least from 15 to 20 feet towards the south-west. The Labyrinth is com-

monly from 17 to 18 feet wide, but expands at one point to 22 feet, and

contracts at another to 15 feet; its greatest height is 18 feet, measured from

the bottom of the excavation.

The walls and roof, though by no means without traces of the erosive action

of flowing water, are in most places extremely rugged, and suggest by their

fretted aspect that even the last of the numerous blocks of limestone encum-

bering its floor must have fallen a long time ago.

ON Kent's cavern^ Devonshire.  5

   It is separated from tlie Long Arcade by a massive curtain of limestone,
descending from the roof to the depth of 9 feet, across a space about 18 feet
wide, being, so to speak, slightly looped up at each end to form two small
entrances. Observers unaccustomed to caverns are not unlikely to speculate
on the cause which prevents the fall of this mass, and to hasten on lest the

time before the event occurs may be undesirably brief.
   Mr. MacEnery had conducted some diggings in the Labyrinth, and had

carried them to a depth of at least three feet at one of the entrances, so that
by assuming a stooping posture ingress and egress became possible. In all
other parts of the chamber his work was much less deep, and, on account of
the state of the floor, was necessarily discontinuous.

  --Omitting the large blocks of limestone, the deposits were : Eii'st, or upper-

most, a Floor of Granular Stalagmite, from which there arose several huge
bosses also of Stalagmite, one of which was 11 feet high above the floor, whilst
its base occupied a rudely circular space fully 15 feet in mean diameter.

    Second, a layer of Cave-earth, rarely amounting to more than a foot in
depth, and sometimes to not more than a few inches, whilst it occasionally
reached as much as 2 feet.

   Third. Though it may be doubted whether there ever was a Floor of the

more ancient, the Crystalline, Stalagmite in the Labyrinth, the lower, and by
far the greater, part of the bosses mentioned above was of that variety, and
was covered with a comparatively thin envelope of the Granular kind, without
any mechanical deposit between them.

   Eourth, the Breccia, or, so far as is known, the most ancient of the Cavern
deposits, lay immediately beneath the Cave-earth, from Avhich there was
nothing to separate it, and extended to a depth exceeding that to which the
excavations were carried.

    In looking at the facts as they presented themselves, day after day, the
following appears to be not improbably the history of the deposits in this
branch of the Cavern.

    During, as well as after, the deposition of the Breccia, with its ursine relics,

stalagmite, having now a crystalline texture, was in course of precipitation,
and in such a way as to form, not sheets ov floors, but bosses oi a more or less

conical form, which, whilst they rested on Breccia, had their lower slopes
covered with the same material, so that their bases were deeply buried in

that ancient deposit. After the close of the era of the Breccia, the precipi-

tation was still carried on, but, as before, in such a way as to add to the
volume of the bosses, and not to produce a floor. Then came the deposition

--of the Cave-earth, containing remains of Bear, Lion, Fox, Hyajna, Mammoth,

Ehinoceros, Horse, Ox, and Bird all of them, with the exception of the first

three, unknown to the Breccia. Later still was the precipitation of that

stalagmite which is granular instead of crystalline, and which not only added
to the dimensions of the already massive bosses, but flowed out in sheets and
covered the Cave-earth. Whilst all these successive operations were in pro-

--ogress, blocks of limestone from time to time fell from the roof some of them

being buried in the Breccia at depths the excavators have not reached, some
lying loose on the Floor of Granular Stalagmite, and others occupying all
intermediate zones and representing all the intervening periods.

    In order to achieve the thorough exploration of the Labyrinth, it was
necessary to break up all the bosses of stalagmite with the exception of the

 largest of them, of which a portion has been left intact, it being believed that

 it shows strikingly the utter inadequacy of the data derived from a boss to
 solve the problem of the amount of time represented by a floor, and vice versd.
                                 --

--6 REPORT 1876.

Before directing the workmen, however, to remove any of these stalagraitic

--accumulations, the Superintendents carefully examined them for inscriptions.

Nevertheless, one inscription was overlooked that already referred to as the
only specimen of the kind within the Labyrinth ; and it was not until a
portion of the largest boss was blasted oif that it was found to have on it
" G. Knight, June 1, 18.36."

    The upper surface of both the Cave-earth and the Breccia rose, with some
irregularities, 38 inches from the mouth of the Labyrinth to its innermost
extremity, giving a mean ascending gradient of about 1 in 17.

    The total number of " finds " in this branch of the Cavern was 135, and
the specimens they included were as follow :

  --Lying on the surface. Three portions of ribs and two other bones (No.

6780), the two latter having been cut with a sharp tool, perhaps by an
existing butcher, and one bone of Bat in a heap of " Pipes " of Stalactite,
probably collected by man.

  --In the Granular Stalagmite. One tooth of Lion.
  --In the Cave-earth. 32 teeth of Hyoena, 7 of Bear, 6 of Fox, 3 of Horse,

2 of Rhinoceros, 3 plates of a molar of a young Mammoth, 1 of Lion, 1 of

Ox, and 1 of Sheep (of doubtful position) ; several bones and portions of bone,
including a tarsus of Bird, and two pieces of bone apparently charred ; 1

--coprolite; and 1 small chip of f jit.
    In the CnjstaUine Stalagmite. 6 teeth of Bear, of which 5 were in one

--and the same jaw.
    In the Breccia. 215 teeth of Bear, and a considerable number of bones, of
which many are good specimens.

    As in all other parts of the Cavern where he had made researches, IVfr.
 MacEnery simply cast aside the material he dug up, without taking it to the
 exterior for final examination. The Superintendents took outside the
 Cavern the " broken ground " met with in the Labyrinth and examined it
 carefully by daylight, as in all previous cases of the kind. It yielded 17
 teeth of Bear, 14 of Hya3na (three of them in pieces of jaws), 2 of the Gigantic
 Irish Deer (in part of a jaw), 1 of Deer, 1 of Horse, 1 of Sheep ; bones and
 pieces of bono ; and i^art of a Crab's claw, no doubt quite recent.

    The exploration of the Labyrinth, commenced on October 28, 1875, was
 completed on July 10, 1876, upwards of 8 months having been spent on it.

     MattJieivs^s Passage.--Having finished their researches in the Labyrinth,
 the Committee proceeded at once to explore the small branch leading from it
 to the Bear's Den, and termed, as already stated, Matthews's Passage, thus
 leaving the two other and adjacent small ramifications to be undertaken on
 some future occasion. To this course they were tempted partly on account
 of the severe and protracted labour which, from their very limited breadth
 and the character of their deposits, must attend the excavation of these
 branches, and partly by the wealth of osseous remains which, from Mr. Mac-
 Enery's description, they are likely to find in the Bear's Den.

     Matthews's Passage consists of two Reaches : the first, opening out of the
 Labyrinth, extends for about 14 feet towards the south-east, where the
 second turns sharply towards east-north-east, and after a somewhat tortuous
 course for about 15 feet, enters the Bear's Den. Their height is from 9 to
 10 feet almost everywhere (measuring, as usual, from the bottom of the
 excavation, which nowhere reaches the limestone floor), and they vary from 3-5
 feet to 7 feet in width. The walls and roof, the latter especially, bear evident
 traces of the erosive action of a flowing stream, succeeded by the corrosion

due, no doubt, to acidulated water, as the surfaces are mucli fretted. Holes,
having the aspect of mouths of small watercourses, open out of the walls and
roof in various places ; and about midway in the Second Reach the roof rises
into a small water-worn dome, from the apex of which a cylindrical flue ascends
iuto the limestone, and, like the watercourses just mentioned, is quite
empty.

    There were but scanty traces of a Stalagmitic Floor in the First Reach, in
which, however, the earlier explorers had here and there broken ground
but throughout the entire length of the Second Reach a Floor of Granular
Stalagmite extended from wall to waU, varying from 10 to 24 inches in
thickness ; and at about 10 fest from its entrance there was also a portion of
a Floor of Crystalline or old Stalagmite adhering to the left wall, whence it
probably never extended to the opposite side. It was about 15 inches thick,
below and almost in contact with the Granular Floor, but separated from it
by a layer of Cave-earth about one inch thick.

   The mechanical deposits in the First Reach were the usual thin layer of
Cave-earth above, and the Breccia of unknown depth below ; but in the
Second Reach the space beneath the Stalagmitic Floor was mainly occupied
with large loose masses of limestone, some of which required to be blasted
more than once in order to remove them. The spaces between them were
filled with Cave-earth or Breccia, with comparatively few specimens of any

kind.

   The upper surface of the Cave-earth was almost perfectly horizontal in the
First Reach; but in the Second there was a gradual and total ascent of 27
inches, giving a mean gradient of about 1 in 7 for that Reach.

   Matthews's Passage yielded a total of 49 " finds," consisting of specimens

--which may be thus distributed :
   In the Cave-earth. 26 teeth of Hytena (some of them in portions of jaws),
2 of Bear, 1 of an immature Mammoth, 1 of Fox, and a considerable

number of bones, many of them being more or less broken and a few of

--them gnawed.
   In the Breccia. 100 teeth of Bear and a large number of bones, including
many good specimens. The richest " finds " were met with in a small
narrow recess in the outer angle at the junction of the two Reaches, where
the teeth and bones lay huddled confusedly together, suggesting that a rush
of water had probably carried them to the spot they occupied.

   No trace of man was detected in any part of this branch of the Cavern.
   The exploration of Matthews's Passage, begun on 11th July, 1876, was

completed on 31st August, having occupied about 7 weeks : and operations

were commenced in the Bear's Den on 1st September.

In looking over the work accomplished, and the discoveries made, since

--the Eleventh Report was presented at Bristol in 1875, the following note-

worthy facts present themselves :

1st. In their Eleventh Report the Committee sketched the distribution in

the Cavern of the remains of the various species of Mammals which characterize

--the Cave-earth. Of this sketch the following is a brief summary: The

Hyaena had been met with wherever the Cave-earth was found ; the Hare had
not been detected anywhere in the " Western Division " of the Cavern

that most  remote  from  the  external  entrances                                           the  Badger, Wolf, and  Ox
                                                                                         ;

had not been found beyond the " Charcoal Cave ; " and relics of Horse,

Rhinoceros, Deer, Fox, Elephant, and Lion had not appeared beyond the

" Long Arcade."
8 REPORT 1876.

 --The discoveries which have since been made require that this sketch should

be corrected in the following particulars : Remains of Ox, Horse, Ehinoceros,

Deer (?), Fox, Elephant, and Lion have all now been found beyond the Long

Arcade, in one or more of the three branches of the Cavern explored since
the Bristol Meeting. In all other particulars the distribution remains at

present as sketched in 1875.

   2nd. No tooth, or, so far as is at present known, other trace of Maehcdrodus

latidens has been met with since the last Eeport Avas drawn up. In short, the

only evidence of the presence in the Cavern of this extinct species of Mammal

which the Committee have detected during the continuous labour of almost

--twelve years, is the one solitary, but well-marked, incisor found 29th Julj^,

1872 a fact well calculated to impress one with the unsatisfactory nature
of merely negative evidence. It cannot be doubted that had this compara-
tively small specimen been overlooked, the palseontologists who, prior to its

discovery, were sceptical respecting the occurrence of MacJiairodus in Kent's
Hole, as stated by Mr. MacEnery, would have believed their scepticism to be
strongly confirmed by the labours of your Committee, whilst the number of
their followers would have been greatly increased.

3rd. As has been already stated, the Committee commenced the exploration

of the Labyrinth on 28th October, 1875, and from that time to 31st August,

1876 (a period of upwards of ten months), they were occupied in it and in

Matthews's  Passage,  both  of  which  they  completely  explored                                       yet, during  all
                                                                                                     ;

that time, and in those two important branches of the Cavern, they found no

trace whatever of prehistoric man. Had your Committee, on receiving their

appointment from the British Association in 1864, commenced their researches

in either of the branches just named (and such a course was by no means

without its advocates), instead of beginning at the external mouth of the

Cavern and proceeding thence steadily through the successive chambers and

galleries, there can be little or no doubt that Kent's Hole would have been

pronounced to be utterly destitute of any evidence on the question of Human

Antiquity, and but poorly furnished with the remains of extinct Mammalia.

The work would probably have been closed without going further, to the

great loss of Anthropology and Palaeontology, as well as of popular education

in these important branches of science.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Prof. Sylvester, Prof.

   Cayley, Prof. Hirst, Rev. Prof. Bartholomew Price, Prof. H. J.
    S. Smith, Dr. Spottiswoode, Mr. R. B. Hayward, Dr. Salmon,
   Rev. Prof. R. Townsend, Prof. Fuller, Prof. Kelland, Mr. J. M.
   Wilson, Prof. Henrici, Mr. J.W. L.Glaisher, andVroi'. Clifford,

    appointed for the purpose of considering the possibility of Imjiroving
   the Methods of Instruction in Elementary Geometry, and reappointed

   to consider the Syllabus drawn up by the Association for the Im-

  provement of Geometiical Teaching, and to report thereon. Drawn
   up by Mr. Hayward.

In a previous Eeport (Report for 1873, p. 459) the Committee recognized the
fact that the main practical difficulty in effecting an improvement in the
existing methods of teaching elementary geometry is that of reconciling the
ON METHODS OF INSTRUCTION IN ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY.                                                               9

claims of the teacher to greater freedom with the necessity of one fixed and
definite standard for examination purposes. They also expressed their con-
viction that " no text-hook that has yet heen produced is fit to succeed Euclid
in the position of authority ; " and that in the absence of such a text-book,
whether the existence of a standard authority in the future such as Euclid
has been in the past be regarded as desirable or not, it is important to secure
" the requisite degree of uniformity and no more by the pubhcation of an
authorized Syllabus " of propositions in a definite sequence, which should be
regarded as a standard sequence for examination purposes, and subject to
which alone any amount of variety in demonstration and general treatment
of the subject should be admissible.

   As it was understood that the Association for the Improvement of Geo-
metrical Teaching was engaged in the task of drawing up such a Sj'Uabus, no
further action was taken by the Committee until the present year, when, the
Syllabus having been completed and published, they have proceeded to con-
sider the same in accordance with the instructions contained in the resolution
reappointing the Committee.

   The Committee have not considered it to bo their duty to examine the
Syllabus in minirte detail, but rather to report on its general character and
its fitness as a basis for an authorized standard sequence of propositions.

   The Committee have no hesitation in stating at the outset, as the result of
their consideration of the Syllabus as a whole, that it appears to have been
drawn up with such care, and with such regard to the essential conditions of

the problem, as to render it highly desirable that it should be considered in
detail by authorized representatives of the Universities and the other great

examining bodies, of the United Kingdom with a view to its adoption, subject
to any modifications which such detailed consideration may show to be
necessary, as the standard for examinations in Elementary Geometry.

   It may be well to observe that the adoption of this or some such standard

SyUabus would not necessitate the abandonment of the 'Elements of Euclid'
as a text-book by such teachers as still preferred it to any other, as it would
at the utmost involve only such supplementary teaching as is contained in

the notes appended to many of the editions of Euclid now in use ; while it
would greatly relieve that large and increasing body of teachers, who demand

greater freedom in the treatment of geometry than under existing conditions
they can venture to adopt.

   Having thiis expressed their opinion of the general merits of the Syllabus
as a whole, the Committee have only further to add a few remarks on its

more important features, which may serve to call attention to those points in

which it differs from Euclid, and which give it a claim on the consideration

of aU who are interested in the improvement of instruction in Geometry.

                                                                                1. Geometrical. Constructions.

It has been found, in the experience of many who have taught Geometry to

young beginners, that the attainment of a firm grasp of its fundamental con-

ceptions and methods is much facilitated by a series of exercises in con-

structions made with the ruler and compasses, such exercises being given

either as preliminary to, or simultaneously with, the study of the earlier parts

Aof Theoretical Geometry.                                                       judicious selection of such exercises is prefixed

to the Syllabus                                                                 and the Committee remark with approval that here, as well
                                                                             ;

as in the Postulates of Book I., the use of the compasses for direct transference

of distances is formally admitted.
10 REPORT--1876.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,

                                               2. Logical Introduction,

   The Syllabus is further prefaced with an introduction, in which are collected
together and formulated the most important logical relations of the several
propositions logically associated with a given proposition, namely its converse, its
obverse (sometimes called its opiiosite), and its contrapositive. It is distinctly

stated, in a note prefixed to this introduction, that it is not intended that a
study of the abstract logical j-elations contained in it should precede the study
of Geometry, but that the introduction should be referred to from time to
time as instances of the applications of its principles arise, until the student

obtains such a grasp of the principles and rules as to be able to apply them
without difficulty. With this understanding the Committee regard the pro-

posed logical introduction as a valuable feature of the Syllabus.

           --3. Separation of Theorems and Problems Loci.

   Throughout the Syllabus, the Problems, instead of being interspersed among

the Theorems, are collected together in separate sections at the end of each

Eook. This may be regarded as equivalent to the assertion of the principle

that, while Problems are from their very nature dependent f()r the form, and
even the possibility, of their solution on the ai'bitrary limitation of the instru-
ments allowed to be used. Theorems being truths involving no arbitrary
element ought to be exhibited in a form and sequence independent of such

limitations. In other words, constructions may be rightly assumed in the

demonstrations of theorems, whether or not they have been shown previously
to be capable of being effected by ruler and compasses, provided only they
can be seen from the nature of the case, or be proved, to be possible. For
instance, the existence of the third part of an angle being regarded as
axiomatic, the impossibility of trisecting an angle with ruler and compasses
only ought to form no obstacle to the ])roof of a theorem for which the trisec-
tion of an angle is required. It should be remembered that the acceptance
of the principle here asserted by no means necessitates in ieacAinr/ that separa-
tion of Theorems from Problems which seems desirable in a syllabus. It is
probable that most teachers would prefer to introduce problems, not as a
separate section of geometry, but rather in connexion with the theorems with
Avhich they are essentially related. The S3'llabu8 in this respect leaves com-

plete freedom to the teacher.
    The early introduction of the notion of a Locus and its use in the solution

of problems by the intersection of Loci the Committee regard with favour ; and
they observe with satisfaction that the Syllabus rightly insists on the demon-
stration of two theorems (a theorem, and either its converse or its obverse) as
necessary for the complete establishment of a locus, a point which is too often

neglected in the investigation of loci,

                                  4. Book I. The Straight Line.

   The Definitions are substantially those of Euclid. An attempt to give a

real definition of a straight line (Euclid's is only verbal) is to be commended,
though the wording is difficult, and would for a beginner require detailed
and familiar explanation.

    The definition of an an|le is another of the elementary difficulties of Geo-
metry. The Syllabus in a note asserts that " an angle is a simple concept in-
capable of definition, properly so called," but enters into a somewhat detailed
         ON METHODS OF INSTRUCTION IN ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY. 11

explanation in whicli the notion of rotation is freely but judiciously used. The
Syllabus does not (like Euclid) limit the notion of an angle to ono less than
two right angles, but it does not explicitly recognize an angle greater than
four right angles. Possibly, considering the difficulties of expression which
the complete notion of an angle of unlimited magnitude involves, this limita-
tion at the outset is wise. The Committee note with approval the use of the
term conjugate for the two angles which, being contained by the same pair of
lines drawn from a point, together make up four right angles.

   They also approve the introduction of the term " identically equal " for
figures which, differing only in respect of position, can be made to coincide
·with one another, whilo the term "equal" is reserved for such as are equal
in area, but not necessarily in other respects.

   The Syllabus divides the Axioms (as, indeed, Euclid did) into General
Axioms (Euclid's Kouai eyvoiai), which find their fitting place in the Logical
Introduction, and specially Geometrical Axioms (Euclid's aJr/z/iara), which

--arc nearly those of EucUd that about the equality of right angles being

omitted, while that asserting that "two straight lines cannot enclose a space"
is extended so as to assert coincidence beyond as well as between the two
points which coincide.

   The Postulates are those of Euclid's ' Elements,' with a modification in the
third postulate, which admits of the direct transference of distances by the

compasses, as before remarked.
    The Theorems of Book I. are mainly those of Euclid I. 1-34, rearranged.

The guiding principle of the rearrangement appears to have been the nearness
or remoteness of the theorems from the possibility of proof by the direct appli-
cation of the fundamental principle of superposition, the free use of this
principle being indicated as desirable in many cases where Euclid j^refers to
keep it out of sight.

    The discussion of the cases of identical equality of two triangles is rendered
complete by the introduction of a theorem asserting the true conclusion from
the equality of two sides and a non-included angle in each, namely, that the
other non-included angles are either equal or supplementary, and that in the
former case only are the triangles identically equal.

   For the treatment of Parallels, Playfair's Axiom that "Two straight lines

that intersect one another cannot both be parallel to the same straight line,"
has been substituted for Euchd's twelfth Axiom, and, in the opinion of the
Committee, judiciously. It may, in fact, be regarded as merely an improved
form of that axiom.

                                          5. Book II. Areas.

    This book contains in thirteen Theorems the various theorems contained in
 Euclid between I. 35 and the end of Book II. Beyond noting the fact that it
 brings together more completely than in Euclid those theorems which are
naturally related to one another, no comment is necessary which is not of the
 nature of that detailed criticism which the Committee do not think it their
 duty to offer.

                                        6. Book III. TJie Circle.

    In this Book the sequence of Theorems differs materially from that of
 Euclid, those propositions being placed first which are fundamental in the
 sense that they follow directly from supei-position. Other criticisms which

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1

miglit be offered on this part of the Syllabus are chiefly on points of detail on
which the Committee think it unnecessary here to enter.

   They would remark, however, with respect to the two modes of treatment
of tangents in the Syllabus, that they would not recommend the second
(depending on the notion of limits) in any case as a substitute for the first,
however desirable it may be that it should be freely used by way of illustra-
tion and as leading up to the methods of Higher Geometry.

7. Eooks IV and V. Ratio and Proportion, and their application to Geometry

A theory of Proportion which shall be at once perfectly rigorous and com-

plete is necessarily difficult. The Committee recognize with satisfaction that

the Syllabus does not attempt to attain simplicity by any sacrifice of rigour,

nor in Book IV. by any sacrifice of completeness. In Book IV. the theory is

essentially that of Euclid in his famous, though (at the present day) little

studied, Fifth Book                                                                                                   it is suggested, however, by an unusually full indication
                                                                                                                   :

in this part of the Syllabus of the forms of demonstration recommended, that

his theory may be presented in a form more easy to be grasped and applied

by the adoption of the late Prof, de Morgan's notation, in which magnitudes

are denoted by capital letters, instead of by straight lines, and their multiples

by prefixing to the capitals small letters denoting integral numbers, instead

of denoting them by longer lines. Opinions will probably differ as to the
wisdom of retaining Euclid's treatment in any shape*; but the Committee

doubt whether any rival theory, which is equaUij rigorous and equallij com-

plete, would be more generally accepted.

It may, however, be thought that this complete theory is one which the

ordinary student can hardly be expected to master at an early stage of his

mathematical studies, even though he may be well prepared for the study of the

geometrical applications of the theory of Proportion. At the same time it is

undesirable that the study of Similarity of Figures &c. should be commenced

without some definite groundwork of demonstrated properties of Eatios and

Proportions. The Syllabus suggests a mode of meeting this difficulty by pre-

fixing to Book V. an indication of a method of treatment of the general

doctrine of proportion, in which greater simplicity is obtained, not by the

sacrifice of rigour, but by a certain sacrifice of completeness, in limiting the

magnitudes considered to such as are commensKrahle.

The notion of Eatio may be regarded as an extension and generalization of

the notion of quantvpUcity, the simplest expression of which is contained in

the question, "How many times does a magnitude A contain another magni-

--tude B ? " This question may be generalized so as to apply to any pair of

commensurable magnitudes in two ways the question taking the shape either

"How many times does A contain some aliquot part of B?" or else " What
Amultiples of and B are equal to one another?" The former leads to a

treatment of proportion such as is usually given with more or less exactness

in treatises on Arithmetic or Algebra, while the latter leads to a treatment

similar in principle to Euclid's, but simplified by its limitation to commensu-

rables. The Syllabus indicates a few of the more important general properties

of proportion which ought to be proved by one or other of these methods, but

leaves it open to the teacher to adopt whichever mode of treatment he may

prefer.

In the Geometrical Applications of Proportion the Syllabus groups together

         * Prof. Cayley is strongly of opinion that it^^ought to be retained.

ON THE B.A. UNITS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.  13

all the theorems which directly depend on the definition of proportion, indi-
cating that the demonstrations are to be adapted to the complete or to the
partial theory according as the one or other has been studied. Alter these
follow the usual standard theorems on Similar Pigures, &c., on which it is un-
necessary for the Committee to oifer any comment.

   The Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching has not yet
published any Syllabus of Solid Geometry. Should the present Syllabus of
Plane Geometry be successful in leading to the establishment of a standard
sequence of propositions in that subject, it is to be hoped that the Association
will continue its labours in the field of Solid Geometry, where the Committee

believe they are equally needed.

Results of a Comparison of the British- Association Units of Electrical

          Resistance. By G. Chrystal and S. A. Satjnder*.

         [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                                among the Reports.]

 --BifficuJtii's encountered. The difficulties of the kind of measurement we

had to make are confined almost entirely to the temperature determinations.
Were it not for these a much higher degree of accuracy could be attained
for while resistances comparable with the B.A. unit can be measured with-
out difficulty to the 100,000th part, it is very difficult to determine the tempe-
rature of a wire imbedded in paraffin, as are the wires of the standards,
nearer than the one tenth of a degree Centigrade, an error to which extent
entails in some of the coils an error of -03 per cent, of resistance.

   A mere comparison of the coils at the temperatures given on page 483 of

the B.A. Report on Electrical Standards (1867)t would hardly have been satis-
factory, since it would have given no check on the accuracy of the observa-
tions and atforded no information as to the temperature value of a variation
in resistance, and conversely.

  --Object aimed at. The object aimed at in the experiments was to get the

diff'erences between the resistances of the several coils at some standard
 temperature, and also the coefficients of variation of resistance with tempe-
 rature in the neighbourhood of the standard temperature.

    That it is inadmissible to apply to any given coil the variation-coefficient
for its supposed material, as found by Matthiessen and others from experi-
ments on naked wires, is abundantly evident. This appears very strikingly

in the case of coils Nos. 2 and 3 (A and B in our subsequent numbering) ; and

 an examination of the results of Lenz, Arndtsen, Siemens, and others for
 platinum shows that within certain limits its behaviour is very uncertain.
 This arises no doubt from the presence of more or less iridium or other
 platinoids, a small admixture of which, without altering the value of platinum

 commerciall}', aftects its electric resistance very considerably.

    * In the spring of last year a series of experiments was made by one of the authors
 (G. Chrystal) with a view of comparing the different resistance-coils of the set of British-

 Association units formerly deposited at Kew Observatory and now in the Cavendish

 Laboratory at Cambridge. In the month of October a final set of experiments was made,
 which was the work of both of us, sometimes working together and sometimes separately.

--Preliminary experiments. The preliminary experiments gave the differ-

ences between the coils and the variation-coefficients approximately.

   The results appeated in some cases different from former measurements,
so that it was thought better not to rely on these, but to make a more careful

set of experiments on which to found the final comparison.

 --Ai^proximate coefficient of " Flat Coil " and Middle Coils. The variation-

coefficient of the " Flat Coil " was taken from the preliminary experiments.

This was given by a fairly good series of ex]5eriment8 ; and a first approxi-

mation was considered sufficient, since the coil during the final experiments

never varied in temperature more tban two degrees, being always bathed in

Athe tap-water.  similar remark applies to the middle coils. The coils used

for middle coils were 29 and 43 (F and G) when neither of these was being

measured, in which case 2 and 3 (A and B) were used. The coefficients of

these coils, so far as required for small temperature-corrections, were taken

--from the preliminary experiments.
   Method of experimenting. The method used in the final experiments was

as follows :

AHFirst.      the coils (the flat coil, the two middle coils, and the coil to bo

compared with the flat coil) were bathed in a stream of tap-water, the tem-

perature of which was carefully taken by means of a Casella's thermometer

(lent us by Mr. Gordon), reading to tenths of a degree Centigrade and easily

estimable to hundredths. After the temperature of the stream had been con-

stant for twenty minutes or so, the difference between the coil to be compared

and the flat coil was found.

Secondly. Another series of experiments was made in which the flat coil

and the middle coils were kept at the temperature of the tap as before ; but

the remaining coil was raised by careful nursing, which lasted two hours or

more, to the temperature (or to one of the temperatures) at which, ac-

cording to the B.A. Report, it is correct.

Lastly. The coils Avere compared with each other at the standard tempera-

--tures, the middle coils being kept at the temperature of the tap-water.
    Variation-coefficients, how found. The first two sets were used to give the

variation-coefficients, being peculiarly fitted to do so, because in them the

temperature of the flat coil did not alter much in comparison with the altera-

tion in the coil compared with it.

  --Differences between the coils, how found. Then using the low-temperature

experiments the differences of resistance between the respective coils and the

--flat coil (all at lO"^ C.) were found.
   Control experinwnts, how used. From this, of course, the difference

between any two coils at any temperatures could be calculated. This was

done for the old standard temperatures, and the results compared with the

results of direct experiment obtained from our third set of experiments.

This gave a test of the accuracy of our work ; and it is on this mainly that

we rely in claiming to have stated the temperatures at which the coils are

--equal within 0°'l C. in all cases.
   Degree of accuracy. The degree of accuracy of resistance varies, of course,
for the different coils. For the platinum units 0"-l C. corresponds to a

variation of "03 per cent, resistance, for the platinum-silver to about -002

per cent.

   In the B.A. Eeport, 1865 (p. 303)*, aUthe coils are stated to be accurate at
the temperatures indicated within -01 per cent. This corresponds to about

one thirtieth of a degree Centigrade for the platinum units. It is not stated

how this degree of accuracy was attained. Some such statement was per-

haps necessarj', considering the difficulty of controlling the temperature of an
inaccessible wire, even within 1° Centigrade.

 --Arranr/ement ^'c. of apparatus. The instruments used in these experiments

for resistance measurements were theWheatstone's bridge and Thomson's gal-
vanometer belonging to the Association. The arrangements in the low-tempe-
rature experiments were as in the annexed figure. At one corner of a large

table is the bridge A B (see B.A. Report, 1864, p. 353*) ; by means of mercury-
Dcups at and Gr, are inserted the flat coil and the coil being compared with it
at E and JF are similarly inserted the middle coils, which were always two of

the units, as small and as nearly equal in temperature-variation as possible.

X, Y, Z are three earthenware jars in which the coils are placed ; these stand in

Va trough, W, provided with a waste-pipe going to the sink. The jars were

kept constantly overflowing by means of a feed-pipe fitted with an ofi'set for

each. The temperature in all three jars was carefully observed, and it was

found that after the tap had been turned on for fifteen minutes or so the

temperature in all three in general became constant, and remained so within

a tenth of a degree for a long time. Now and then irregularities occurred,
which caused the rejection of the results concerned. Thin wires go from E

and from the contact-block C to the galvanometer at the other end of the

table. The last adjustments of the balance were made by observing the

spot on the galvanometer-scale with the telescope from where the ob-

Hserver sits. The battery- circuit terminates at  and J, and is made and

Abroken by means of a treadle worked by the observer's foot.  small

Leclanche's cell was found sufficient to indicate a deviation from balance

of a tenth of a millimetre on the bridge-scale. Since the contact of the

block-piece could not be relied on within less than this, no higher battery-

power was ever used.

  --Thermoelectric disturbances. To avoid thermoelectric currents, oAving to

the junction of copper with brass at the block, the button of the block-piece

was never touched by the fingers, but always by means of two pieces of
wood, which were exchanged now and again to prevent heating. It was

louad impossible to avoid tliis disturbance altogether ; and accordingly the

following mode of procedure was adopted :
--WeDirect magnetic disturbances.
                                   first carefully investigated whether

there was any direct magnetic effect on the galvanometer owing to the

currents in the apparatus ; this was done by simply short-circuiting the

--galvanometer. No such effect could be detected. Being assured of this, we

always operated as follows : Threw in the galvanometer by pressing down the

button, then allowed the needle to come to rest with the small permanent

deflection due to the thermoelectric current. If now, on pressing down the

treadle for an instant, there was no motion of the spot, we concluded that

there was a balance. It is to be noticed that since we are near balance

the battery-circuit is conjugate to the galvanometer- circuit, and that, there-

fore, making or breaking the battery-circuit does not alter the effective resis-

tance opposed to any electromotive force, thermoelectric or other, in the

galvanometer-circuit. (Of this we also assured ourselves by direct experi-

ment.) Another advantage of this method is that it ensures the least

possible use of the battery, and thus avoids disturbances from heating.

During our final experiments both of us had acquired by considerable j^rac-

tice an acquaintance with the indications of the galvanometer, which enabled

us to adjuib^t the balance quickly, and thus secure in greater measure the

advantage above mentioned.

 --Self- and mutual induction. It is also worth remarking that from the

way the B.A. unit coils are wound, and from the general arrangement of

the apparatus, neither self- nor mutual induction could have any sensible

disturbing effects in our experiments *.

 --Method of using bridge for finding coejjUcients of variation Sfc. In finding the

variation-coefficients of the coils the bridge arrangement was used in the way

described in the Report on Electrical Standards, 1864 (p. 353, &c.) ; but in

finding the difference between the resistances of two coils, the method de-

scribed by Prof. Foster (in the Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers,

October 1874) was used. In this method the bridge is first read with the

normal coil and the coil to be compared- with it in one position, and then

the coils are interchanged ; the difference of the bridge-readings gives the

--required difference of resistance in units of the bridge.
   Bridge-miits. The unit in which we shall state our results further on is

the resistance of a tenth of a millimetre of the bridge-wire, which is a metre

long and has a resistance of about ·075 ohm.

  --Calibration of bridge and thermometer. The wire was carefully calibrated,

but no errors were found large enough to affect our results.

The thermometer used was also compared with a standard thermometer

belonging to the laboratory, and the corrected temperatures are in every

case given. The degree of accuracy attained in this last compaiison was pro-

bably about -05 Centigrade.

  --Description of coils in the case. In the case containing the coils there

are altogether fourteen coils. Five of these are multiples of the unit, viz.

2, 3, 5, 8, and 10, and have brass labels on them ; but the inscriptions have

never been completed by filling in the last two figures of the temperature at

Wewhich they are equal to the standard.        have not been able to get any

description of these whatever, and have therefore not measured them.

Besides these there accompany the box two coils marked A and B, which

are not units, and a flat coil described as a normal coil, besides a set of

bridge witii pieces of wood to screen it from dust and radiation from the body of the

observer.

   Coils measured. The coils which we have measured are, therefore, 2, 3,

58, 35, 36, 29, 43. These we call for convenience A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

The normal coil is the flat coil at 10° Centigrade. This temperature is

chosen because it was the lower limit of the temperature of the tap-water,

which varied on diflerent days from 10° to 12°, though it was very constant

during a good part of any one day. As far as our experience went, the use

of a stream of tap-water was the best as well as most convenient way of

reducing the coils to a known temperature *.

thermal resistances observed during the past year and communicated in this

Report may be exhibited with equal clearness, and an easy comparison may

by this means be made of the values found in this and last year's series of

experiments where the same rock-specimens, or specimens of very closely

allied kinds of rock, were submitted in the former and in this year's series

Ato examination.  slight change, however, is here introduced in briefly

describing the results obtained numerically, by employing, instead of the sig-

nificant figures of those results (as was done in the last Report), the tenth

part of them as a brief expression for the absolute thermal conductivity.

Thus the absolute thermal conductivity of galena in the present list being

0-00705 in centimetre-gramme-second units, hitherto described for brevity by

its significant figures 705, will be spoken of in this Report as 70-5, to which

the meaning may conveniently be attached that 70"5 gramme-degree units of

heat per second pass through a plate of galena one centimetre thick, having

an area of one square metre, for a temperature-difference of one degree be-

tween its faces.

The method of investigation without the use of a thermopile has hitherto

proved unsuccessful, no soft material capable of effecting a close junction

with the rocks having yet been found of sufficiently constant resistance to

afford a useful standard of comparison with them when the rocks are intro-

duced between its layers ; but the progress of the investigation has shown

that a simple water-film (if it could be preserved from drying off with porous

rocks) effects a complete junction between them and any impervious surface,

Aas that of caoutchouc, against which they are pressed.  similar film of oil,

it appears from some experiments recorded in the presscnt list, is less effective

for the purpose ; and to ensure a constant water-film in which the thin wires

of the thermopile could be placed, pieces of well-soaked bladder kept soft in

water rendered antiseptic with carbolic acid were laid on the india-rubber

faces of the boiler and cooler, so as to press the thermopile-wires against the

rock with a constantly moist and uniformly wet surface. The duration of an

experiment and the temperature to which they were exposed (usually be-

tween 100° and 120° l^'.) were never so great as to cause the bladders to

approach dryness before the termination of the experiment. The proportion

of moisture absorbed by the rocks (when sensibly porous) was ascertained,

and it was always such a small fraction of that imbibed by the same rocks

thoroughly soaked in vacuo that it i^robably exercised a scarcely sensible

influence on the results. Its amount, and that of the full quantity of water

absorbable by the porous rocks tested, is stated in the list; and from the

corresponding alteration of the observed conductivity some idea of the pro-

bable correction necessary to be applied for the presence of moisture in some

of the porous rocks during the process of the experiment may be obtained.

The two chief defects of the thermopiles used hitherto had been their

thickness (making them intrude too far from the rock-surface into the badly

conducting strata with which it is in contact), and the false thermoelectric

currents proceeding from irregularities of material and internal condition of

the wires subjected to great varieties of temperature along their length. To

diminish the former source of error, Avires less than half a millimetre (040

millim., or -^ inch) in .diameter were used and neatly soldered at the

junctions ; and to counteract as far as possible the remaining evil, they were

chosen of the most dissimilar metals (iron and German sUver), and twelve

junctions above and twelve below the rock-plate formed a continuous circuit

giving a very strong thermoelectric current. The whole resistance of the

circuit (including the 20 ohms usually added to bring its indications con-

veniently within the scale of a Thomson's reflecting galvanometer) was 40

ohms when the wires were coupled for observing a difference of temperature
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

and it was assumed that, with this resistance and with the probable tendency

of twelve wires similarly circumstanced to neutralize each other's false efl'ects,

no sensible errors from local disturbances would arise. The instrument was

submitted to some careful tests, with a result that, at the highest temperatures

of the experiments, errors in the temperature- difference amounting to about

1° F. may have been committed. At the ordinary temperatures of the wires

between 100° and 120° F. it was found, by substituting a heated iron disk

(coated on the faces with thin paper) in the place of a rock-plate, so as to

heat both sets of wires equally, that the only permanent deviations produced

as the plate sunk verj- slowly in temperature also sunk gradually with it from

an equivalent value of about |° to about g° upon the scale. As the coiTect-

ness of the small temperature-differences (of 6° and upwards) lying usually

between the above two temperatures was thus fairly checked, and for exception-

all}' higher differences and temperatxires the conditions could not easily be more

exactly assimilated to those of the actual experiments so as to control and

estimate them, the effects of these small errors have not been further regarded

in the calculations ; but in order to avoid changes of value in the divisions of
the scale, and to enable the actual temperature of each set of wire-junctions

to be directly observed, an arrangement of the thermopile was made by which

each set of junctions could be separately combined with a similar set in con-

tinuous circuit with the galvanometer placed in a small rectangular water-

bath. The latter is made of tin, and, as well as its lid, is well jacketed with

cork, and provided with an agitator ; so that by adding hot or cold water,

which can be withdrawn below, any temperature of the water in the bath

Acan be obtained.  simple commutator enables the circuit with the galvano-

meter to be closed, either through the two principal sets of junctions or

through one of them and through a set corresponding to it in the bath ; so

that by changing the temperature of the latter until no current passes through

the circuit the actual temperature of each rock-face could be observed. This

mode of observation is fi-ee from all objections, excepting those of false

currents arising in long wires and plates of the same metal maintained at

very various temperatures ; but with the exception of the twelve loops of

German-silver wire projecting on one side from the rock-plate, the corre-

sponding loops on the other side, and all the rest of the circuits made to the

galvanometer, were formed from the same piece of iron wire freshly annealed.

The comb-like teeth of the commutator are pieces of narrow hoop-iron about

3 inches long, closely set together in wood, and also thoroughly annealed, to

which the proper terminals of iron wire are soldered at their feet, while the

upper ends are filed to chisel-edges ; and a small hand-rack of iron wedges set

on wood at proper distances apart, thrust between them in different positions,

completes the connexion in the three different orders that are required. The

additional branch wires used in the arrangement are few, and, as will be seen

from the following description, add very little to the total lengths of iron

wire which conduct the currents. The twelve-turn coil of wire in which the

rock is pressed consists of twelve half-turns or loops of German silver and

the same number of iron loops. The twelfth looj) of German silver (see

figure, p. 22) completes the circuit or connexion from the beginning to the

end of the coil through the medium of the galvanometer. There are

thus twelve junctions of dissimilar metals above, and twelve below the rock-

plate in a closed circuit with the galvanometer. To produce a new set of

twelve junctions corresponding to each of these, the loops of German-silver

wire are all cut through in the middle, and the free ends soldered to twenty-

four short pieces of iron wire, the junctions being laid side by side across a

narrow water-tight trough formed of three or four rectangular washers of
caoutchouc laid on a shest-caoutchouc floor, upon which the sides of the rectan-
gular tin bath, open at the top and bottom, are pressed down. The tin bath is
5 inches long (the same as the width of the rock-sections), nearly the same
height, and 2 inches wide ; and it is provided with a false bottom, through
the perforations of which the water reaches the wires, and is kept agitated
above by a thermometer passing through a longitudinal slit in the lid and
attached to a small tin blade, without injuring them. The twenty-four
extremities of iron wire projecting 1 or 2 inches beyond the bottom of the
bath are there soldered to the feet of twenty-four teeth of the commutator,
and the twelve iron wedges of the hand-rack being inserted between the

points of these teeth, completes the circuit connexion in the ordinary way for
observing a diffei'ence of temperature between the two principal sets of
junctions of the thermopile. As a proof of the trustworthy action of the
instrument, it may be mentioned that when, in the course of an experiment,
the reading of the galvanometer with the thermopile thus joined up was
 being noted, and water of various temperatures from 60° F. to 160° F. was

 poured into the bath where the twenty-four supplementary junctions are
 placed and are all included in the circuit, not the smallest effect was pro-
 duced upon the reading as soon as the water in the bath had by gentle
 agitation become uniform throughout in temperature. Not only are the two
 opposing sets of twelve junctions heated in the bath on the average all of
 exactly equal force, so as to balance each other, but the false currents, which
 in such ranges of temperature must be evoked with sensible intensity if any
 of them should prevail, either neutralize each other exactly or are entirely

 absent, as it appears equally probable to conjecture, in this portion of the

 apparatus. As regards formation of the circuit through one of the principal
 sets of junctions only, accompanied by a corresponding set of junctions in the
 bath, this is accomplished as is represented in the annexed outline sketch,
 where two pairs of junctions only
 (a b, a V), above and below the rock-

 plate, are shown, thin lines represent-
 ing iron and thick lines German-silver

 wire. B is the bath in which the

 supplementary junctions, s'sss', ob-
 tained by severing the loops of German-

 silver wire, as at ss, are immersed.

 The two extreme half-loops and cor-
 responding teeth of the commutator

 serve to complete the circuit with the
 galvanometer; and the arrangement

 for every additional severed loop of
 German-silver wire introduced be-

 tween them will easily be apprehended
 from the single intermediate one, 5 s,
 here shown. The iron wedges, lu lu iv,

 commutator are shown by black dots,

tho upper junctions (a, a') and carried through the, bath to a separate tooth of

the commutator ; and by moving the wedges of the rack-piece together one

tooth-space to tho right or left (as shown in new positions by a x in tho

figure), combinations of junctions in the bath with junctions (a a') above or

{bb') below the rock-plate are put into connexion with the galvanometer.

   By the same mode of trial as before, a heated iron plate coated with thin

paper being substituted in the place of an experimental plate, the tempe-

ratures of its two faces, as exhibited by the thermometer in the bath when

the commutator was shifted from one of its two supplementary positions to
the other, were sensibly the same as the heated plate slowly cooled, and no

false difference of temperature arising from false currents differently excited

in the two circuits thus joined up were found to be indicated as a result of
several such determinations of the really equal temperatures of the two faces
of the plate. This mode of observing the actual temperatures and the
temperature-differences of the rock-faces in the present series of experiments

was therefore constantly employed, and the values of the scale-divisions in
degrees for the other more usual method of employing the thermopile were
not determined with special care, although this adjustment of the commutator
was also used to check and follow the gradual variations of temperature-
difference that were less speedily, although more certainly, measured by the
absolute method of determination. The only case of failure to observe a
sensible difference of temperature between the two sides of an experimental

plate occurred with iron-pyrites, which (as weU as galena), being a good

conductor of electricity, it was foimd necessary to coat with two thicknesses

of the thinnest tissue-paper on each face; and the apparent difference of

temperature recorded (which was decidedly less than 1°) may have arisen

from the resistance offered by the slight obstructions of these thin paper
sheets (soaked with water) to the passage of the heat : although certainly very

great, no definite value of the thermal conductivity of ordinary iron-pyrites

can therefore be assigned. It was also necessary to use oil junctions instead
of wet bladders, from the galvanic effects produced by the saturated salt
solution, when rock-salt was tested ; and it appears probable from some
measurements of quartz with the same kind of luting that the conductivity
of rock-salt thus found is somewhat less than, rather than likely to be in excess
of, the real thermal conductivity of that substance. As a good assurance that
when membranes wetted with water were used to press the thermopile
against the rocks the true temperatures of their faces were very nearly

marked, the experiment with iron-pyrites may be instanced, as the small

temperature-difference of less than 1° could not have been observed if the
wires were not very nearly indeed at the same temperature as the two paper-
covered faces of the pyrites against which they were pressed ; and as the
circumstances of their adjustment in other cases were exactly the same as in

this instance, it may be assumed that the method of pressing the thermopile

against the rocks with wet bladders adopted in the present series of experi-
ments exhibited the true temperature -difference of the faces, and afforded
correct values of the thermal conductivities. The pressure was applied by
 means of strong spiral springs (instead of the weights described in the last
 Report), whose extensions in a graduated tube indicated the pressures which
they were made to exert. The pressure thus applied was usually SO lbs.
 upon a surface of nearly 20 square inches of the rock-plates, or about 4 lbs,
 per square inch. The general agreement of the results with those formerly
 obtained also serves to verily the correctness both of the thermal conduc-

 tivities now air^signed and of those previously observed. The principal

 differences in the two m.elhods of determination consist in the use of an im-

ascribed to the numberless small precautions required to ensure perfect

accuracy, than to any constant errors of the methods with which either of the

two series of determinations is now believed to be aifected.
   In concluding this description, some remarks on the results of the new

experiments that have been carried out will serve to show what new data

have been obtained, and how far the observations made last year are corro-

borated and confirmed by the slightly modified apparatus and method of

procedure that has been adopted to extend the series.

   Among the points of principal importance noticed last year the following
facts of great interest already ascertained have now been verified and con-

firmed. Quartz is still found to have about the same high thermal conduc-

tivity (85-88 concisely expressed, as explained at the beginning of this

Repoi-t) compared to the other rocks which had been pre^^l0usly observed.

The direction in which heat is transmitted through slate is a very important

--condition in regard to its conductiug-power the conductivity of good Welsh

(Festiniog) slate cut across the cleavage being, however, to that of a plate of

the same stone cat parallel to the cleavage-planes, as 5 : 3 from this year's

experiments, instead of 6 : 3 very nearly, as observed in the same slate
specimens last year. The notable part of this difference of the two years'

observations is in the better-conducting cross-cut plate (54 instead of 66),
although the other Icss-conductuig plate (31-5 and 3:2-5) has nearly the same

conductivity as it appeared to have last year. Cleavage-fractures which the

cross-cut plate has suffered, and their repairs, rendering its surfaces uneven

and the water-junction contacts consequeutlj^ somewhat imperfect, have

probably caused this apparent loss of conductivity in the transverselj' cut

specimen of slate. But this latter still exhibits a much higher thermal con-

ductivity than that shown by the plate from the same piece of slate cut

Aparallel to its cleavage-planes.  less distinct difference was found this

year in similarly sawn and tested plates of clay-slate cut across and parallel

to the planes of cleavage or of foliation ; biit the stronger kinds of the stone

which supplied a transverse section (as well as the less fragile plates cut

parallel to the planes of cleavage) presented the appearance of cleavage and

foliation only very imperfectly, and much less remarkably than the specimens

of ordinary slate from Wales. The thermal conductivity of the soft clay-

slate is also less in all directions (26-28-5) than the least observed conduc-

tivity (31-5) of Welsh slate cut parallel to its cleavage-planes.

The observations of the effect of moisture in increasing the conductivity

of the porous rocks, when thoroughly saturated with water, entirely corro-

borate the similar observations made last year. When the great pressure

required to force a sensiblequantity of water through such rocks as sandstone

and others which were tested is compared with the verj' feeble currents

which differences of temperature and of density of the water in their cavities

can produce, it appears evident that the very marked increase of conductivity

observed in such cases cannot be owing to convection- or gravitation-

currents in the water which the saturated rocks contain, although the

mobility of the liquid by diffusion and consequent intermixture of its mole-

cules probably assists the direct condueting-power of water in the transmission

of the heat ; and the resulting conductivity of water, free from the action of

convection-currents, appears to be at least equal to that of some rock-species

whose thermal conductivities are either the last or nearly the lowest in the

present list.

   The thermal conductivities of certain new species of rocks are now also

assigned, the values of which, although they are few in number, appear to

possess considerable interest from a mineralogical as well as from a geological

aspect. Some crystalline rocks and minerals of simple composition (and of

the cubic system of crystallization) were selected, and, like quartz, they

proved to have heat-conducting properties in a high degree. The thermal con-

ductivity of iron-pyrites, resembling apparently that of the metals, could not,

from its high value, be accurately determined by the method of experiment
pursued ; and it is accordingly omitted (as undetermined) from the list. The
diathermancy of rock-salt for the heat radiated and absorbed by the oiled

surfaces between which the tiial plate of it was placed will not account for

more than Jjj part of the heat which the plate actually transmitted ; and

the high position of this substance in the list is consequently due to a really

high conductivity which rock-salt possesses (about 113), greater than that

of quartz (85-88), and even of fluorspar (92|), the substance found to rank

Anest to it in high conducting-power.  specimen of galena nearly pure, but

enclosing a few fragments of quartz, presented the highest thermal conduc-

Ativity (TO^) next to that of quartz.  plate of soft, white, opaque calcite,

perfectly but irregularly crystallized (forming vein-stuff in Clifton sandstone),

agrees exactly in its thermal conductivity (-iG'T) with various kinds of marble

(46-49) which were tried last year. On the other hand, a similar specimen

of heavy spar (barium sulphate) from a mine of that substance npar Exeter

presents, in spite of its great density, a remarkably low thermal conductivity

(17-18 in two experiments), not very far removed from that of English

alabaster (gypsum, or calcium sulphate, 23-4). English plate-glass (20-4), it

may also be remarked, has a low thermal conductivity, differing not very

greatly from those of the two substances last named. Finally, the lightest

species of rocks examined in the course of these experiments, pumicestone

and Newcastle house-coal, have also the lowest conductivities (5-5 and 5-7)

hitherto presenting themselves in these investigations.

As, with the exception of rock-salt, clay-slate and elvan, house-coal and

pumicestone, no new thermal resistances of great importance, in a geological

point of view, are added in the present list to those already exhibited in the

diagram of these Reports (vol. for 1875, p. 59), a new graphic representation

--of the resistances now found is here deemed unnecessary the values of the

 absolute resistances furnished in this Table enabling them to be added without

'difficulty in that diagram, where they may thus be exhibited in the same

normal scale with the earlier determinations.

The applications to questions of underground temperatures which these

observations suggest have not yet engaged the Committee's attention suffi-

ciently to enable them to arrive at definite conclusions certain enough to

entitle them to be noticed in this Eeport. Examples of very reliable mea-

surements of imderground temperatures, such as have recently been obtained

in the tunnels of Mont Cenis and of St. Gothard, and in the deep vertical

boring at Sperenberg, near Berlin (the last of which, although extremely

deep, passes almost entirely through rock-salt), are ill-adapted to test distinctly

the relative values of the thermal conductivities of different species of rocks

the former two from the irregular surface-configurations, and the last from

the absence of any change of the strata through which these borings pass.

In view also of the many disturbing conditions that affect both the local rate

of change and the actual observations and measurements of underground

tcmperatui'es in other borings more suitably adapted to exhibit clearly the

differences of thermal resistance in geological formations, which the Com-

mittee is endeavoiuing to distinguish and to recognize in actual cases, it

would be premature, in the present stage of the investigation, to deal more

particularly with results derived immediately from these and from similar

comparisons, the degree of dependence to 1 e placed on which cannot very

casilj"- be defined. The agreement which they trust eventually to trace
between the observed temperatures and the experimentally determined
thermal properties of the locally predominating rocks is liable to be masked
and concealed by causes of disturbance of so many unknown and unsiispccted
kinds, that plain and obvious corroborations are not frequently to be expected ;
and the nature of those causes which principally tend to disturb the results
Avill probably become better known by the progress of further comparisons
such as the Committee is now endeavouring to pursue. While it was thus
anticipated by Prof. Everett*, from the slow rate of temperature-variation
from the surface observed in the rocky excavations of the Mont-Cenis tunnel,
that quartz (which is a principal ingredient of the rock) would prove to have
a high thermal conductivity, this property is now also found to belong to
rock-salt, through which the Sperenberg boring passes with an average rate

of temperature-variation (1° F. in 51 English feet) scarcely differing sensibly
from the mean rate obtained from a mass of similar observations taken in
other places and recoi'ded by the Underground Temperature Committee.

The apparent contradiction presented by these two cases may possibly proceed
from a more rapid local rate of variation of temperature in the neighbourhood
of Sperenberg than around Mont Cenis ; and the fact that in the first GO

fathoms of ordinary strata overlying the rock-salt the observed rate of

variation was slower than below (contrary to what would be expected from
the relative conductivities of the superincumbent strata and the underlying
masses of rock-salt), is said, in Herr Bunker's description of the obser-
vations, to be probably accounted for by the intrusion into the boring near
its mouth of the Avaste warm water of the engines on the surface. The

effect, it may be observed, of a highly conducting mass, like that of the deep

bed of rock-salt here penetrated, by diminishing the local resistance and
increasing the flow of internal heat outwards through the Sperenberg strata,

would be to cause the local rate of variation of temperature in this locality

to be abnormally rapid ; and perhaps this may explain why a slow rate of

variation is not observed in this instance, from the great depth of the ex-
cellently conducting rock-salt formation, which considerably exceeds 3000 feet.
The Sperenberg boring thus presents examples of secondary conditions which
will perhaps prove to be in good agreement (instead of, as they at first appear

to be, somewhat at variance) with the results of the Committee's observations.

28 REPORT-- 1876.

  --1. Measure of value wanted.- The question of a common measure of value

is one of a class that may be literally called standard questions, and its

solution is at the basis of equality in taxation both general and particular.

Values are the object matters of taxation, their measurement and comparison

are the necessary condition of its equal incidence ; and measurements with

unequal measures are like weighings with luijust balances. Taxation, how-

ever pure its intention, without a common measure of value, is what navigation

would be without sextant and chronometer, or architecture without compass

and level. And this perhaps is not an unfair description of what it actually
is, though not, it may be hoped, of what it must be. One of the chief marks

of advancing science has been a progress towards better measures and better

measurements, a substitution of the uniformities of rules of reason for the

unrestricted vagaries of rules of thumb ; and such is the aim of the present
inquiry. This question of a common measure of value is the question of the

common measure of taxation ; or if there be several such measures, what is
their common ratio ? what are they in terms of one another ?

 --2. Tivo Methods of General Valuation: Capital-Value and Usable Value.

Measurements of the value of things (employing this word " things " as

inclusive of land, labour, stock, &c.) may have reference to their absolute
worth or to their temporary uses. They may have reference to their pro-

perty, capital, or absolute values, or to their products, profits, or annual

values. The one measure is exemplified in contracts of sale and purchase,

the other in contracts of letting and hiring. Each has its special advantages

and special applications. Capital or absolute value is ajjplied in the assess-

ment of probate and legacy duty ; usable value in the assessment of local

taxation and in those of the imperial income-tax. Moreover, as the capital-

value of the thing must be equivalent to the present value of the sum of its

future uses, the two measures, if consistently defined, though differing it may

be year by year, must be in the long run equivalent. But such consistency

of definition is an essential. Tlie idea of capital-value is tolerably well fixed,

but that of usable or lettable value is indefinite. Usable value is, or is

equivalent to, the consideration paid for, the income received from, the use

of things. This consideration, however, may be paid under such totally

different conditions of contract that, unless these conditions are first assimi-

lated, the payments regarded as measures, either of the values of the things

or of the abilities of their owners, are worse than useless : they are mis-

leading.

 --3. Usable Valve unrestricted and indeterminate and lience unfit as a com-

mon measure. To illustrate this : things having a use, and hence capable of

becoming sources of income, are all, by the very nature of the process, liable

                                                 ;
--to
sumption. Efficiency implies cost cost, for the most part of insurance

against natiual risk ; of repairs ; of necessary depreciation. But the user of

a thing, be it land, labour, or stock, may engage for its use with or without
liability to these outgoings ; their costs may be borne by the user or by the
owner, or they may be divided between the two in any proportion that con-
venience may direct. The user may bear repairs and the owner natural risk
and depreciation, or the user may bear natural risk and repairs and the owner

natural depreciation, or the user may bear all and the owner none, or the user

none and the owner all, the consideration given (the income received) of
course varying accordingly. Were the things valued by absolute sale or

capitalization, all the incidents, whether of efficiency or cost, plus or minus,
would be wholly and uniformly included, and the test would fix the things'

relative positions. In valuation by uses, hoAvever, it is evident that these

incidents are not as a matter of practice uniformly included, and the valutitiou,

founded upon unfixed conditions, can fix nothing ; its possibilities of variation

are coextensive with those of free contract itself, and hence, being absolutely

unrestricted, as a measure it must be inherently unfit.

 --4. Exemplified in incomes of Income-tax. Such valuations, some tempering

effect of deductions notwithstanding, have been those ol' local taxation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

hence the local chaos which Mr. Sclater-Booth's bill was the last attempt to

reduce to order. 8uch also, without any tempering influence, are the

valuations of income under the present income-tax. In this latter the

returnable and taxable incomes of interest, land-rent, house-rent, royalties,

wages, including professional fees and salaries, are the considerations that

are paid for the uses of principal monies, land, houses, mines, and labour

respectively. Interest, however, is the consideration paid for the use of the

principal, neither user nor owner being subject to any outgoings. Land-rent

is the consideration paid for the use of land, the user bearing almost all

outgoings. House-rent is the consideration paid for the use of houses, the

owner and user sharing the outgoings in various proportions. The owner

also largely bears outgoings in the contract of mines and royalties ; he wholly

bears them, as a rule, in that of labour and wages. Moreover these out-

goings vary according to the nature of the thing ; they may vary from zero

up to 40 or 50 per cent., or even more, of the gross production. It is these

differences that give rise to the various characteristics of incomes, as gross,

net, certain, precarious, terminable, permanent, nominal, real. All, indeed,

are in the catalogue of considerations paid ; all are so-called incomes

received, but only

                         " As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
                           Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are cleped
                         All by the name ot dogs."

   The true account " distinguishes " we are told, and gives to each " particular

addition : " the measure of incomes, too, that lays claim to scientific truth
must do the same, and to the " bill that writes them all alike " and taxes
them aU ahke, must add natural differences and just discrimination.

   5. Usable value specialized and determined as Interest-value. By consis-

tent deduction of outgoings. Interest-value as the common measure required.
And if the cause of these inequalities of valuation be rightly stated, the dis-
covery of such measure ought not to be difficult. As the inequalities arise
from the different conditions in respect to outgoings under which the various
incomes are calculated, the remedy must be the assimilation of these condi-
tions ; and the case of principal and interest, which in one aspect may be
regarded as a common expression of sources and uses generally, may be
employed as a precedent. Interest, as before said, is the income received
from a thing free of outgoings. It leaves the thing or its capital value
unimpaired. The extension of this idea to revenues or incomes in general
is simply the universal deduction from them of their productive outgoings

equivalent to the general restoration of the capital-values of their respective

sources. Under such a regime, returnable and taxable income would not be
land-rent, house-rent, mine-royalties, labour-wages ; but land-rent minus
land-outgoings, house-rent minus house-outgoings, mine-roj'alties minus
mine-outgoings, labour-wages mimis labour-outgoings ; and similarly with
terminable annuities and the profits of business, the outgoings, however,
being in all cases only the necessari/ ones of the production. The result thus

obtained would be what by analogy Ave may call the interest-value of the

various sources ; and such interest-value of land, of labour, of houses, of
--30 EEPORT 1876.

economic agencies generally, would be the common measure required. And

the measure is a perfectly scientific one, and, indeed, admits of mathematical
expression. As the exact difference, comprehensively considered, between
the total receipts and total outgoings of a source, it is the pure annual
increment of its capital-value, and hence is identical with absolute profit. It
would rejiresent the pure annual growth of national wealth taken in its

--widest sense, and the returnable income of national taxation.
    6. Precedents for its practicahility. But are such deductions of outgoings
on the sources of income and the determination of the interest-value practi-

cable ? In many cases this question has been already solved by actual

legislation. That such deductions are practicable for lands, houses, and

mines may be proved by reference to the Metropolis Valuation Act of 1869,

and to the Local Valuation Bill before referred to, both of which are grounded
on them, and have schedides of deduction for different cases attached. That
they are practicable for machines, ships, trade fixtures, horses, and stock
generally, the Income-tax Act, with its special clauses for repairs and re-
supjjly, itself recognizes ; and though no schedules or deductions are attached

for these cases, the deductions are wcU known in the estimates of business

and recognized in the Surveyor's office. But if such deductions of outgoings
are practicable for the labour of horses, are they not practicable for the labour

of men ? Economically considered, the two labours are analogous ; both are

productive agents, both have productive powers subject to consumption.

Natural risk, maintenance, and terminability belong to the labour of men

just as they belong to the labour of horses, just as risk, repairs, and termina-
bility belong to machines, ships, or implements. All these outgoings are facts

equally ascertained by experience, and it is difficult to see why their valuations
are not equally practicable. They are as much an item in a source's general

account as the receipts themselves, forming its debit as these form its credit
column. Nor can any account, be it individual or national, be said to be
complete unless both sides are considered.

  --7. Effect on Income-tax Act.- The application of this interest-value measure

--to the Income-tax Act would give these results : Incomes from lands, houses,

and mines would be charged much the same as under the proposed new local
valuation system. Dividends and profits of capital, pui-ely considered, would
be charged as at present. Government and other terminable annuities would
not be taxed on the amount representing the restoration of caintal. On the
same principle the incomes from labour, whether pure, as in the case of
salaried officers and some professors, or mixed with the proceeds of capital,

as in other professions and as in businesses, would be entitled to material
deductions varying with the relative proportions of skill and capital engaged.
In all cases the tax would be collected at the source and levied on the net
value of the produce ; and the deductions would be made without reference,
as such, either to the position or fortune of the owner.

  --8. Practicahility exempJiJied in comjjosite incomes. Questions may be raised

on the practicability of applying an outgoings dcduclion to incomes from
businesses and professions which are the mixed results of labour and cajjital.

It may be objected either, first, that as labour and capital enter into these

mixed incomes in vai-ying proportions, and as the percentage of labour-
outgoings is very different from that of capital-outgoings, a deduction common
to these mixed incomes and to unmixed labour-incomes would be unjust ; or,
 secondly, that if the labour-income and capital-income be assessed separately
 a separate return of capital will be necessary, and that this must entail an
 objectionable exposure of affairs. To meet the first objection, a classification
               ON THE ASSESSMENT Ol' UIIIKCT TAXATION.            31

of business and professional incomes, with a varying percentage deduction

according to the average proportion of capital in each class, has been pro-

posed ; but it may be doubted if the second objection has any just foundation.

That the assessment of an income from conjoint sources does not necessarily

involve an official return of these sources, may be seen by looking to the

return of the income of capital or stock itself, as exemplified in all large

trading companies. This income, regarded in the concrete, consists of the

conjoint incomes from houses, ships, machinery, stock, trade fixtures, all of

which incomes having diiferent outgoings, are singly and differently assessed

by the owner, but all of which are united, without statement of particulars,

in one common official return. What is practicable, however, with the

incomes (derived, say, from horse labour plus machinery) is also practicable

with those derived from human labour plus capital generally. Doubtless, in

order to value the labour-income separately from the cajntal-income, the two
must be separately known to the valuer, but not, therefore, separately

returned to the Government unless Government undertakes the work of

accountant. Tlie distinction between the two (the one technically known

as profits, the other as interest) is a primary distinction in book-keeping

usually given in every profit and loss account. Capital being [known (and

this knowledge is as necessary to the preparation of an accurate return under

the present system as to that under the proposed one), its interest subtracted

from the mixed income will give the technical profits, gross labour-income,
or gross wages of the capitalist. The deduction of labour-outgoings from

the labour-income will give the labour's interest-value, which, j^lus the

interest of the capital, will be the interest-value or returnable income of the

business or profession.

--AExample 1.  (a barrister, physician, or salaried officer) has ^1000 a year,

an unmixed gross labour- income. Assuming, c.(/., 40 per cent, to be

the average labour-outgoings for risk, maintenance, and " depreciation,"

       the deduction will be ,£400 and the interest-value ,£600. A's returnable
       and taxable income will be ^600.

--Examjile 2. B (a solicitor or general medical practitioner) has ^2000 capital

      in his practice, and a gross income as now returnable of £1000 a vear,

the joint result of his personal labour and his cajjital. Interest bein"-
reckoned at 5 per cent., £100 will be the interest-value of his capital,

and £900 the gross income, wages, or so-called jorofits of his labour.
The deduction of 40 per cent, from this for labour-outgoings leaves £540

      as the labour's interest-value, which, jj?«s £100 as the interest of capital,
      gives £640 as the interest-value of his practice. B's returnable and

       taxable income will be thus £640.

--Example 3. C (a merchant, manufactnrer, or shopkeeper), having a capital of

      £10,000 in his business, has a gross income of £1000 a year, the joint

       result of his cajntal and personal labour. Here, under the former

suppositions, the interest of his capital will be £500, and the '-ross
income of his labour wiU be £500. Deducting 40 per cent, for labour-

outgoings, as before, we obtain £300 as the labour's interest- value,

which, ^j/i(s the interest of the capital, equals £800, the interest-value

of the business. C's returnable and taxable income will be £800.

  --Zero-p)oint of Direct Taxation. In the remuneration of labour, as we

descend in the scale, there must be a point at which income and outgoings

balance, and at which, therefore, interest-value or real profit is zero. This

important point in labour, analogous in land to the commencing point of

that a common measure of value determines. Wherever the point may be,

below it there is no interest-value, and hence ought to be no taxation ; and

it is above this point that in strictness the percentage deduction for outgoings

ought in every case to begin.

--Example 1. A, a labourer, earns 30s. per week, an unmixed gross labour-

       income. Assuming this sam to be only sufficient to meet the necessary

labour-outgoings, then the interest-value of the income wiU be nil. A's

£44 as the labour's interest-value. B's returnable and taxable income

  A similar preliminary process of correction applies to aU higher labour-

incomes, the zero-point being determined by the amount fixed on as the

labour's necessary outgoings.

  --9. Proposed new Valuation System intermediate to the Self-assessment and

Official Systems. The practical working of a measure of value, like other

Ameasures, has necessarily a relation to the persons by whom it is a,pplied.

just measure, through careless or wrong application, may act unjustly ; but

unjust application is no argument for an unjust measure ; an unjust measure

even when rightly applied must act unjustly. In the income-tax, as now

arranged, with its five or six inconsistent measures of value, the valuation
for some of the chief schedules ranges between the loose liberties of self-
assessment and the inquisitorial stringency of ofiicial : the one system con-
scious of a radical injustice in the law, which it is itself called on to api^ly,
the other in total ignorance of the facts which the law covers, and both

working in antagonism to each other. In the valuation for probate duty we
have a third system, applied not by the interested individual nor by the

official, but by a third and independent party, authoritatively licensed, indeed,
by the Government, but selected by the individual, and hence whilst ne^itral
himself, having responsibilities to each. Under an equitable measure of

value, self-assessment might in the first instance exist as at present ; but in
cases of doubt Government might require the guarantee of such an independent
authority (licensed valuer, accountant, lawyer, acting as a semiofficial com-

missioner in income-tax) for a second evidence to the truth of the return,

reserving its own power of official examination as a last resort. At the
present time many firms do actually call in professional accountants to make
up their returns ; and with a growing sense of justice in the tax, such an

independent guarantee to the truth of the return might not improbably

become general, and might even acquire the force of a custom,

    10. Capital-value and Interest-value equivcdent on a series of years, but not

--for each year. The two measures, capital-value and interest-value, are, as

before observed, on a series of years equivalent. Interest-value is capital-
value for a year. Capital-value is the present worth of interest-value for all
       ON THE ASSESSMENT OF DIRECT TAXATION.     33

years. But though the two measures are thus equivalent ou an average of

years, they are not equivalent for each specific year. Interest-value measures

the gains of capital for one year, and capital-value measures its gains for

that year, with the expectant or probable gain of future years added. As,

however, national gain for any year has, as a rule, the closest relation to the
national expenses for tliat year, the interest-value is a more specific measure
for annual taxation than the capital-value ; and this is probably the reason
that has imconsciously led to the adoption of an annual-value measure, both

in local and imperial taxation, in preference to one of capital or perpetual

value.

  --Capital-value in comparative relation to things and to tenures generalli/.

Measures practically equivalent may, however, through differences of appli-

cation, give contrary results ; and of this the two measures in question afford

illustrations. Taxation, according to capital-value, may look either to the

sources, things, or objects owned, or to the rights and tenures of their

--owners to the land, labour, or stock possessed, or to the- freehold, leasehold,

life-tenancy, or jointure, as the case may be, of the possessors. Prima facie

it would appear that as the value of the tenures of a thing, however manifold,

can be neither more nor less than the value of the thing itself, the results of
the scientific capitalization of the tAvo should be identical. As a matter
of fact, however, this has not been admitted to be the case ; and it is on the
question of tenures that the deepest controversies of the income-tax have

arisen.

  --Capital-value in relation to terminahle tenures. As the capital-value of a

limited tenure in an estate, for example, is less than that of a permanent
one, its taxation, it is argued, ought to be less, and therefore it ought to pay

at a lower rate. Putting aside for a moment the question of the truth of
this inferejico, it is evident that its enforcement would make an estate's
taxation vary with the character of its tenure, thus giving power to the

subject to alter taxation by altering tenure, and that to almost any extent.
To avoid this it has been proposed to derive the whole tax from the estate

as at present, but to levy on the limited tenure according to its capital-value,

and to make the reversion liable for the balance.

 --Terminalility of tenure does not influence the Annual Tax. "Without dis-

cussing the administrative difficulties of this view, it may be questioned

whether such a view be a logical deduction from the principle of taxing

tenures according to their capital-value. Assuming that a limited tenure in

an estate ought to pay less than a permanent one, with reference to its

capitalized value, it would not therefore follow that it ought to pay at a lower

annual rate. Be the tenure long or short, the estate for any given year is

the same, the value for that one year's tenure is the same, the government

protection afforded to it for that year is the same, and hence it would appear

that the payment for each year ought to be the same also. But if each year's

payments be the same in both cases, the total payments are not therefore

equal ; the limited tenure pays only for a limited time, whilst the perpetual
tenure pays for all time ; and if these payments bo aggregated it will be found

that their amounts are in exact proportion to the capital-values of the

respective tenures. Should it be said that the reversioner, having interests

in the good government of the present, ought therefore to contribute according

to the value of these interests, the reply is that the present possessor has been

the reversioner of the past, and has had similar interests in the good govern-

ment of the past. If, therefore, i)resent possession has a claim on the future,

it owes a debt to the past ; and it may be mathematically shown, what

perhaps a sense of the fitness of things indicates, that for any given year the
claim and debt will cancel each other, and leave every year's possession to
pay the whole year's tax on the estate possessed.

    Difference between incomes from terminable tenures and tJiose from termi-

--nable things. That a terminable income by paying at the same annual rate as

a perpetual income is equally paying according to its capital-value, is a pro-
position insisted on by Mr. AVarburton and by Mr. Mill in the two Commissions
on the Income-tax ; and as far as the above class of terminable income is
concerned, the proposition is true. But these gentlemen unfortunately
carried it into a region where it had no status, and iu virtue of it denied the
applicability of capital-value, if not of arithmetical proportion generally, as
a reforming measure of the income-tax. As there are incomes and incomes,
so there are terminable incomes and terminable incomes. If the terminable
income be the terminable tenure of a pure interest-value, such, practically
speaking, as a life-interest in land or iu consols, to tax it at the same rate
as a permanent income is to tax each according to its capital-value. If,
however, the terminable income be an income that is made up partly of
interest-value and partly of capital that terminates, not simply as a legal
right, but by gradually exhausting its source, then to charge such income at
the same annual rate as a permanent one of similar amount is not to tax it

--according to its capital-value a truth repeatedly demonstrated by the

actuaries before Mr. Hume's committee, and evident from the reflection that
the capital-value of the source is, by the very nature of the income, continu-
ally passing away, whilst the tax remains the same. Under the conditions
stated, the tax on the one terminable income would be a tax on pure
interest-value, the tax on the other would bo a tax on a mixture of interest-
value ^j7its capital. By combining the propositions of the actuaries and of
Mr. Warburton, each true in its own sphere, but each erroneous when

applied to the other, we may conclude that the results obtained from the

capitalization of tenures are identical with those obtained from the absolute

valuation of sources ; and both may be quoted in confirmation of those

obtained from the principle of interest-value.

    Capital-value in relation to 'personal riches and property. Common measure

--of value as needful for equal exemption as for equal taxation. Another appli-

cation of capital-value as a measure, however, cannot be so quoted. The

taxation of a particular property according to capital-value may be inter-

preted as taxation, not according to the worth of that particular property,

but according to the absolute worth or financial position of the person who
owns it ; and siich a method of levy has been erroneously defended as
taxation according to ability. In this view a rich man ought (considerations

 of practicability apart) to pay a heavier duty upon his dog, liis bottle of wine

or whiskey, than a poor man ; and, the estates being equal, the owner of a

 permanent tenure would pay more for each year's possession than would the

 owner of a limited one. Such a theory of capital-value may not be general,

 but it has a certain degree of popiilarity, and seems to be constantly getting
 itself mixed up not only with discussions but even with legislation .on the

 incidence of the income-tax. It may be questioned whether the operation of

 this theory is not visible, for example, in the exemption from imperial direct
 taxation (recently so largely extended) of large masses of property in the

 country including many thousands of acres of land, in consequence of the

 accident of their ownership. Property thus exempted becomes property
 taxable by mere change of possession, irrespective of the intrinsic nature or
 value of the property itself. To exempt in an income-tax the necessary

outgoings of the source of income, be it labour or land, is merely to confine

the tax to its own stated objects, viz. to income proper ; but to exempt or

lo^Yer the rate on this income proper, merely in consideration of the personal

--status of its owner, is to travel into quite a different region it may be into

the region of national charity, or into that of some other pi'inciplc, but

assuredly far away from that of equality in taxation. It may be added that
such exemptions, even when admitted, need a common measure of value for

their rational application. There are small incomes and small incomes
incomes that are pure interest-values, incomes that are pure drafts on capital,
and incomes that are mixtures of interest- value and draft on capital ; and
the equal exemption of these kinds, as in the present income-tax, is as un-
equal as would be their equal taxation. As before said, the interest-value
measure itself would exempt all small labour-incomes to the extent of their

necessities without further special rule.

  --11. Common measure of value necessary to tlie adjustment of general tax-

ation : fallacies from its absence. " Your Committee also feel that it would
be unjust to make any alteration in the present incidence of the income-tax,
without at the same time taking into consideration the pressure of other
taxation upon the various interests of the country, some of it imposed by recent
legislation, and in one case especially, that of the succession duty, to some
extent by way of compensation." This, written in 1861, is the last sentence
of the Eeport of the Select Committee appointed in that year on the equa-

lization of the Income-tax ; and perhaps no paragraph could be qiioted as a

stronger argument for the necessity of determining a common measure of
value. It may, indeed, be thought by some that for the j)urpose of internally
equalizing a tax over its own area, be that area sugar, coffee, or incomes, a
preliminary inquiry into the pressure of taxation in general is somewhat of
a work of supererogation ; and it may not be mathematically obvioi;s to
others what possible sort of compensation can exist between the inequalities

--of a tax, or a set of taxes, that are almost stationary, and those of one that

changes with every national emergency that in twenty years has actually
compassed the extremes of sixteenpence and twopence in the pound, with
every variety of intermediate oscillation. But assuming it to be advisable
for the purpose in question, as it must doubtless be always generally useful,

to know the comparative pressure of taxation as a whole upon the interests

of the country, it is clear that such a knowledge implies their valuation

through a common measure, and is, indeed, as impossible without it as would
be the knowledge of the weights of different things without weighing them
by a true balance. Eminent statists have, indeed, attacked this problem,

using income itself as the means of the comparison, though oftentimes without
a sufficient preliminary examination of the accuracy of their instrument.
Comparing the statistics of different classes of income, as collected from the
government returns and from inquiries specially made, with the statistics of the
 corresponding classes of taxation, they have sometimes concluded that general
taxation is, as a whole, tolerably equal. The truth of this conclusion evidently
 depends upon the uniformity of the standard employed. As, however, this
uniformity has no existence (the government returns alone presenting at
least five or six different modes of estimate), the argument can prove nothing
as regards general equality, except its absence ; but does prove that taxation

                                                                                                  D2

in general, regarded as a larger income-tax, is equtdl)' in want of a common

measure with the income-tax proper. So far from the measurement of the

income-tax proper being dependent on the measurement of general taxation,

the measure that underlies them both is one and the same ; and, indeed, the
tnie view of an income-tax is that it should be a perfectly just and equal

tax in itself, rather than an imperfect tax compensating the imperfections of

other taxes.

  --Common measure of value necessary for finding national income andtuealth :

fallacies from its absence. The evil consequences of a want of a common

measure of value, seen in the comparison of incomes for purposes of taxation,

is also seen when they are added togetlicr for the exhibition of the amoi;nt
of national income and wealth. To find this national income, the government

returns of the income-tax have been taken, and to this miscellaneous aggre-

gate the exempted incomes of the country, including manual-labour wages,

have been added, as if all were of one equal and uniform denomination.

Much of such income, however, as has been repeatedly pointed out, is only

the consumption of capital. Within the period of a generation, say thirty

years, all the value of human labour, pZus the cost of maintaining it, passes

into the category of labour-income. Within longer but varying periods the

value of all houses, j^Iks the cost of repairing them, passes into the categorj'

of house-income. Within still more varying periods all the mining wealth

of the  country  must  pass  into  the  category  of  mining-income  and  disappear
                                                                                                                ;

and all capital of terminable annuities passes into terminable income. By

some writers this medley of so-called income (but no more income than the

payments for exj)orts are income, or drafts on bankers are income) has ever

been capitalized at one (and that an extreme) rate, to get the national wealth,

the result of the whole process being an exaggerated and practically mis-

chievous estimate of national income, of national wealth, and of the nation's

capacity to bear taxation. Probably no better example than this could be

given of the necessity of a common measure of value. Common measures

(common units) are the souls of statistics, as, indeed, they are of knowledge

generally. Without them statistics are a mere incoherent mass of facts,

usurping the semblance and function of exact science. A common measm'e

of income, discovering the amount of the element common to rent, wages,

profits, and interest, determines the true increment of wealth considered in

its widest sense, and expresses both the extent and the ratio of economic

progress. This common measure may be briefly described as interest-vahie :

it is an essential, if not the fundamental, basis of taxation.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Clerk Maxwell,
   Professor J. D. Everett^ and Dr. A. SciiusteRj for testing experi-

   mentally Ohm's Laiv,

TnE statement of Ohm's laAV is that, for a conductor in a given state, the

electromotive force is proportional to the current produced.

   The quotient of the numerical value of the electromotive force divided by

the numerical value of the current is defined as the resistance of the con-
ductor ; and Ohm's law asserts that the resistance, as thus defined, docs not
vary with the strength of the current.
ON OHM^S LAW.  37

    The difficulty of testing tliis law arises from the fact that the cinrcnt
generates heat and alters the temperature of the couductor, so that it is ex-
tremely difficult to ensure that the conductor is at the ^ame temperature
when currents of different strengths are passed through it.

    Since the resistance of a conductor is the same in whichever direction the
current passes through it, the resistance, if it is not constant, must depend
upon even powers of the intensity of the current through each element of

the conductor. Hence if we can cause a current to pass in succession

through two conductors of different sections, the deviations from Ohm's law
will bo greater in the conductor of smaller section ; and if the resistances of
the conductors are equal for small currents, they will be no longer equal for

large currents.

   The first method which occurred to the Committee was to prepare a set of

five resistance-coils of such a kind that their resistance could be very accu-

rately measured. Mr. Hockin, who has had great experience in measuring
resistance, suggested 30 ohms as a convenient magnitude of the resistance
to be measured. The five coils and two others to complete the bridge were

therefore constructed, each of 30 ohms, by Messrs. Warden, Muirhead, and

Clark, and it was found that a difference of one in four millions in the ratio

of the resistance of two such coils could be detected.
    According to Ohm's law, the resistance of a system consisting of four

equal resistance-coils joiued in two series of two should be equal to that of
any one of the coils. The current in the single coil is, however, of double
the intensity of that in any one of the four coils. Hence if Ohm's law is not

true, and if the five coils when compared in pairs with the same current arc

found to have equal resistances, the resistance of the four coils combined

would no longer be equal to that of a single coil.

  A system of mercury-cups was arranged so that when the sj^stem of five

coils was placed with its electrodes in the cups, any one of the coils might be
compared with the other four combined two and two. After this comparison
had been made, the system of five coils was moved forward a fifth of a revolu-
tion, so as to compare the second coil with a combination of the other four,

and so on.
   The experiments were conducted in the Cavendish Laboratory by Mr. G.

Chrystal, B.A., Fellow of Corpus Christi College, who has prepared a report

on the experiments and their results.

  A very small apparent deviation from Ohm's law was observed ; but as this

result was not confirmed by the much more searching method of experiment
afterwards adopted, it must be regarded as the result of some irregularity in

the conducting-power of the connexions.

   The defect of this method of experiment is that it is impossible to pass a
current of great intensity through a conductor without heating it so rapidly
that there is no time to make an observation before its resistance has been

considerably increased by the rise of temperature.

  A second method was therefore adopted, in which the resistances were com-

pared by means of strong and weak currents, which were passed alternately
through the wires many times in a second. The resistances to be compared
were those of a very fine and short wire enclosed in a glass tube, and a long

thick wire of nearly the same resistance. When the same current was passed
through both wires, its intensity was many times greater in the thin wire

than in the thick wire, so that the deviation, if any, from Ohm's law would
be much greater in the thin wire than in the thick one.

    Hence, if these two wires are combined with two equal large resistances in
38 KEPORT--1876.

Wheatstone's bridge, the condition of equilibrium for the galvanometer will

be different for weak currents and for strong ones. But since a strong current

heats the fine wire much more than the thick wire, the law of Ohm could not

be tested by any ordinary observation, first with a weak current and then
with a strong one, for before the galvanometer could give an indication the
thin wire would be heated to an unknown extent.

    In the experiment, therefore, the weak and the strong current were made
to alternate 30 and sometimes 60 times in a second, so that the temperature
 of the wire coiUd not sensibly alter during the interval between one current
 and the next.

    If the galvanometer was observed to be in equilibrium, then, if Ohm's law
is true, this must be because no current passes through the galvanometer,
 derived either from the strong current or the weak one. But if Ohm's law is
 not true, the apparent equilibrium of the galvanometer-needle must arise from
 a succession of alternate currents through its coil, these being in one direction
when the strong current is flowing, and in the opposite direction when the
weak current is flowing.

    To ascertain whether this is the case, wo have only to reverse the direction

 of the Aveak current. This will cause the alternate currents through the gal-
 vanometer-coil to flow both in the same direction, and the galvanometer will
 be deflected if Ohm's law is not true.

    Mr. Chrystal has drawn up a report of this second experiment, giving an
 account of the mode in which the various difficulties were surmounted.
 Currents were employed which were sometimes so powerful as to heat the
 fine wire to redness ; but though the difficulty of obtaining a steady action of
 the apparatus was much greater with these intense currents, no evidence of
 a deviation from Ohm's law was obtained ; for in cverj- experiment in which
 the action was steady, the reversal of the weaker current gave no result.

     The methods of estimating the absolute values of tho currents are described

 in the Keport.

   A third form of experiment, in which an induction-coil was employed, is

 also described ; but though this experiment led to some very interesting re-
 sults, the second experiment gives the most searching tost of the accuracy of
 Ohm's law. Mr. Chrystal has put his result in the following form.

     If a conductor of iron, platiniim, or German silver of one square 'centimetre
 in section has a resistance of one ohm for infinitely small currents, its re-
 sistance when acted on by an electromotive force of one volt (provided its

 temperature is kept the same) is not altered by so much as -^tj^ part.

     It is seldom, if ever, that so searching a test has been applied to a law which
 was originally established by experiment, and which must still be considered
  a purely empirical law, as it has not hitherto been deduced from the funda-
 mental principles of dynamics. But the mode in which it has borne this test
  not only warrants our entire reliance on its accuracy within the limit of
  ordinary experimental work, but encourages us to believe that the siinplicity

 of an empirical law may be an argument for its exactness, even when we are
  not able to show that the law is a consequence of elementary dynamical

  principles.

                     Cambridge. Communicated by J. Cleek Maxwell.

unit time, measured either by a galvanometer or by a voltameter, bo C,»thcn,

according to Ohm's law*, E- is directly proportional to the length of tho con-

ductor, and inversely proportional to the area of its section.

   The coefficient of proportionality for a definite-^ substance depends merely
on the temperature of the substance ; for unit length and unit section of a

--given substance the value of the ratio for a given temperature is called the

                                                                                                                \j

specific resistance of the substance for that temperature, and is one of the

most important of its physical constants.
   This law has been directly verified by its discoverer, and by Becquerel,

Davy, Fechncr, Kohlrausch, and others ; and indirectly it has been verified
for a great variety of substances with a degree of accuracy approached in few

physical measurements.

Lately, in discussing some experiments of his own, Dr. Schuster has raised

the question whether after all Ohm's law is only an approximation, the limit

Weof whoso accuracy lies within the region of experiment.       might suppose

pi

that tho ratio J-^, was some function of C", say

specific resistance, and S is a small constant which, according to Dr. Schuster's

--suggestion, would be positive. It is clear that call only be an even function

of C, unless we admit unilateral conductivity, for which there is no experi-

mental evidence in a purely metallic circuit.

  A Committee of the British Association, appointed to consider the subject,

were of opinion that it Avas of importance to attempt a further experimental

verification of Ohm's law.
   At the suggestion of Professor Maxwell, the experimental details of two

methods of verification proposed by him were undertaken by the writer of
this Report. Of the two experiments representing these methods the second
is by far the most conclusive. It not only avoids the difiiculty of eliminating
temperature effects, which to a certain extent interfere with the first experi-
ment, but it pushes tho verification of Ohm's law very near the natural limit

of all such verifications, viz. the limit of the solid continuity of the conductor.
It has thus been rendered proba))le that experiment cannot detect any
deviation from Ohm's law, cither in the direction indicated by Dr. Schuster,
or in the opposite direction as suggested by Weber, even in wires that have
been brought by the electric current to a temperature beyond red heat.

   A third experiment was also tried by the writer of this Report ; its result

agreed with the others, but, owing to certain peculiarities, it is less conclusive
than they are. It led, however, to interesting results of another kind, which

of Ohm's law cannot safely be drawn from experiments of the nature of

other by means of the same current, were equal, say each = E. That is to
Asay, if any two of the resistance-coils were inserted in the branches B and
ADU of a Whcatstone's bridge, the other tAvo arms, C and C D, being two
Gother equal resistances, then the galvanometer inserted betM'cen E and C

would indicate no current.

E BDSuppose now that we replace the coil in  by four of the equal coils

arranged in multiple arc, as in fig. 2. Then, if Ohm's law be true (i.e. if

resistance be independent of current), if p be the resistance between B and D,

         1 _ ^ J. = 1

         p 2E 2R E'

I.e. p=E, and there will still be no deflection in the galvanometer. But if

Ohm's law bo not true, and the resistance be a function of the current, then,

Asince the current through B is nearly the same as in the first experiment,
while that through B E D and B F D is half, the resistances in B E, E D, B F,
DF will bo no longer eqiial to E, but either greater or less, and the galvano-

meter will be deflected.

    Under the direction of Professor Maxwell, part of the funds at the disposal

of the Committee were devoted to providing two sets of coils sijecially
adapted for the above experiment. One set consisted of five coils of silk-
covered German silver wire (diameter -G millim.), each of resistance as nearly
as possible equal to 30 B.A. units. These were all wound together in the

usual way round one bobbin ; the terminals consisted of ten pieces of stout

copper wire, insulated from each other by a ring-shaped piece of ebonite,
through which all of them passed. These stout wires were bent over, and
                                         --

cut as nearly as possible of the same length, so that their amalgamated ends
might go in pairs into mercury-cups. The wire and bobbin were enclosed
between two coaxial cylinders of sheet brass, which were fastened to the
ebonite piece above, and connected by a ring of sheet brass beloAV. The
whole had a rough resemblance to a large spider. The other set consisted of
two coils made of the same wire, and having each as nearly as x^ossible the
same resistance. They were arranged in the same way, except that the ter-
minals of the same coil were adjacent.

   As the adjustment of the coils was necessarily not perfect, the experiment

could not bo tried exactly as described in the above scheme. I decided,

--therefore, to operate as follows : First, to compare each coil of the five with

the coil next in order ; the differences between any two coils could then be
found in terms of an arbitrary unit (the resistance of a tenth of a millimetre
of the platinum-iridium bridge wire at the temperature of the room during
the experiment) ; second, to compare each coil with the foux others arranged
in multiple arc, as before described. The results thus obtained were com-

pared, as will be described further on.
   To facilitate these comparisons, the following aiTangement of mercury-cup

connexions was made for me by Mr. Garnctt, of fit. John's College, the

Demonstrator at the Cavendish Laboratory :

To a massive board are glued five large mercury-cups, made of boxwood,

with a piece of amalgamated sheet copper at the bottom. Into these go the

ten teiininnls of the five coils, so that there would be metallic connexion

piece of vulcanite, which insulates the two terminals in that cup. ? is a

Astout copper bow connecting B and the lower division of ; to this bow is

soldered one of the galvanometer terminals. Into the cups u and v dip the

bridge, which is the instrument used by the British-Association Committee of

1863, and will be found described at p. 353 of the Eeport (1864) of the Com-

mmittee on Electrical Standards. To is soldered one of the battery terminals.

The connexions on the right are similar to those on the left, and may be un-

derstood from the diagram. The other galvanometer terminal goes to the

contact-block L. The battery used consisted of twelve Leclanche's cells, the

Avhole internal resistance of which was about 13 B.A. units, its E.M.F. being

about 16 times that of a Dauiell. The whole resistance of the bridge from F

to Gr was about -075. The galvanometer is an instrument made by EUiott

Brothers, belonging to the British Association ; its resistance is about half a

B.A. unit.
   Good contact between the feet of the copper terminals of the quintuple coil

and the bottom of the mercury-cups was secured by placing a weight on the
top of the coil ; the spring in the terminals was thou sufficient to ensure

contact everywhere.

   In the arrangement figured in the diagram the pcoil is balanced against a

multiple arc, containing q and r in one branch, and s and t in the other.
To compare one single coil with the next single coil, I is removed, and one

mend of the galvanometer wire connected instead with the cup E, while is
Amade to connect the lower instead of the upper half of with u ; with this

arrangement the coil t is balanced against the coil s.

The coils in the quintuple coil are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ; and in experi-

Aments with multiple arc the coil between  and B is referred to as the

D" single coil ; " in experiments with single coUs those between  and E

Aand E and  are called right coil (E.G.) and left coil (E.G.); the coils

between iv and .v and u and v are called right and left middle coils (E..M.C.

and L.M.C.), and are numbered 1 and 2. The bridge is read from left to

right.

Some preliminary experiments were made with the apparatus, which

showed that the coils had been very well adjusted by the makers, Messrs.

Warden, Muirhead, and Glark. It was found that with the arrangement

described (the best at our command in the Cavendish Laboratory), the bridge

Acould be read to a quarter, if not to an eighth of a millimetre.  small

correction was found necessary for the magnetic field, due to the current in

the bridge connexions ; this was allowed for by adjusting a loop of the
battery-wire till the galvanometer showed no effect when the battery was

turned on. Thermoelectric currents in the galvanometer circuit, owing to

heating from the hand at the contact-block, were avoided almost entirely by

using two pieces of wood, which were interposed between the fingers and the

block, and were continually changed so as not to get hot.

  --The order of experiment was generally as follows : The weight was ad-

justed on the quintuple coil, the battery was thrown in for a moment by

means of a treadle which closed the battery circuit ; if there was no direct

effect on the galvanometer, the battery was thrown out, and contact made at

the block ; the spot of light on the scale was watched through a reading-
telescope, and if it was at rest* the battery was thrown in : the deviation

indicated which way the block had to be moved to get a balance. Two or

three trials in general sufficed to get the balance. Tlic bridge was then

read ; the middle coils were then reversed, the balance foimd, and the bridge

read again. The difference of the readings gives the difference of the resist-

ances of the middle coils, as may easily be shown (see ' Journal of Society of

Telegraph Engineers,' Oct. 1872). The middle coils being replaced as before,

the quintuple coil was moved round one step, and the same process repeated.

   * On the avoidance of small thermoelectric effects, see below iu the discussion of the

second experiment.

Let the right-hand middle coil (No. 1) be taken to be 30 ohms, the bridge-

wire being -075 of the same units. Let t denote the resistance of this coil,

the unit being the resistance of a tenth of a millimetre of the bridge-wire,

therefore

+ + +same units, be r-f-a, r /3, r y, r o, 7--|-e.

resistances of the connexions at its two ends. This gives

   Now the greatest possible value of 10000 x is 6000, since the readings

Hence the terra involving  1000-   --- is less than

   The above peculiarities suggested to me to make a set of experiments on
the plan of keeping the current going as much as possible. It was hoped

that thus a certain hmiting state, as regards temperature, would be arrived
at, which from the construction of the coils would in a great measure be
independent of small variations of temperature in the experimenting-room *.

    This method of proceeding would not introduce any error in the com-
parison of single coil with single, and the error introduced into multiple-arc
experiments would be regular and could be alloM'ed for. The last of the sets
of experiments given below was conducted on this plan with satisfactory

results.

   But the whole deviation is probably introduced by some slight defect in
the apparatus, and part at least can be accounted for ; for it occurred to me,

in looking over the results quoted above, that a defect in the insulation at
the divided cup would partly account for such a deviation. Suppose that

the divided cup offered a very large, but not infinite, resistance / to the

that is,/=6 megohms. Curiously enough, when I proceeded to measiu'c the
 insulation resistance of the divided cup it came out very nearly 6 megohms
 but the insulation resistance between any two of the remaining cups was
found to be about 12 megohms, which reduces the correction somewhat. The
complete solution of the problem would be complicated ; but we may approxi-
mate by considering each of the coils in the multiple arc replaced by a
multiple arc whose arms are 30 ohms and 12 meghoms respectively ; this
requires that /3, y, 2, e should each be reduced by 10. Hence the whole reduc-

+tion in a--^Q3+y +d e) would be on this supposition 10. It would really

be somewhat less ; however, this would almost bring the deviation between

observation and calculation within the limits of experimental error. Any

 remaining ditference is probably duo to a defect in some mercury-cup in the
multiple arc, for there being more there than on the other side of the balance

 the chance of a defect is greater.
    It ought to be mentioned that the insulation of the quintuple coil was

 tested, and found in every case to be of a higher order of magnitude than a

megohm.
    Some time after the series of experiments just described, I dismounted the

 mercury-cups from the stand, which had meantime been carefully dried on
the hot-water pipes in the laboratory. Each cup was remounted with a
piece of gutta percha between it and the board ; and the divided cup, which
 was found radically defective, was replaced by two mercury- cups on separate
'pieces of insulating material. The insulation between every pair of cups was
 then tested afresh and found in every case of a higher order than a megohm.

    The experiments were then repeated with the altered stand. The sensi-
 bility of the arrangement was about the same as before, although a less
 electromotive force was used (10 cells). The results were much the same

--as before, except that the sum of the values of a K/S+y-f^-l-e), &c. was

 now much smaller, two experiments giving ---31 and --34. Dividing this

--by 5, we get G for the average deviation, which is very small. The fact

 that we still get a result in the same direction shows that this is not an

 accidental error ; but it might very well be accounted for by some of the
 suppositions mentioned already. It might also arise from over-correction for

 symmetry.

   On the whole, therefore, we cannot conclude that there was any denation

fronti Ohm's law under the circumstances of this experiment. It is hardly
worth while to estimate the value of this experiment quantitatively, as the

second experiment now to be described is so far superior in this respect.

                    Second Experiment.

                                 Introduction, by Prof. Maxwell.

   The service rendered to electrical science by Dr. G. S. Ohm can only be

rightly estimated when we compare the language of those writers on electri-
city who were ignorant of Ohm's law with that of those who have understood
and adopted it.

    By the former, electric currents arc said to vary as regards both their
" quantity " and their " intensity," two qualities the nature of which was

very imperfecly explained by tedious aud vague expositions.
    In the writings of the latter, after the elementary terms " Electromotive

Force," " Strength of Current," and " Electric Resistance " have been defined,
the whole doctrine of currents becomes distinct and plain.

   Ohm's law may be stated thus ;

    The electromotive force which must act on a homogeneous conductor in
order to maintain a given steady current through it, is numerically equal to

the product of the resistance of the conductor into the strength of the current

through it. If, therefore, we define the resistance of a conductor as the

ratio of the numerical value of the electromotive force to the numerical

--value of the strength of the current, Ohm's law asserts that this ratio ig

constant that is, that its value does not depend on that of the electro-
motive force or of the current.

   The resistance, as thus defined, depends on the nature and form of the
conductor, and on its physical condition as regards temperature, strain, &c.
but if Ohm's law is true, it does not dejiend on the strength of the current.

    Ohm's law must, at least at present, be considered a purely emjiirical

one. No attempt to deduce it from pure dynamical principles has as yet

been successful ; indeed Weber's latest theoretical investigations * on this

subject have led him to suspect that Ohm's law is not true, but that, as the

electromotive force increases without limit, the current increases slower and
slower, so that the " resistance," as defined by Ohm's law, would increase

with the electromotive force. On the other hand, Schuster t has described
experiments which lead him to suspect a deviation from Ohm's law, but in

the opposite direction, the resistance being smaller for great currents than

for small ones.

   LorentzJ, of Leyden, has also proposed a theory according to which Ohm's
law would cease to be true for rapidly varying currents. The rapidity of
variation, however, which, as he supposes, would cause a perceptible deviation
from Ohm's law, must be comparable with the rate of vibration of light, so

   The conduction of electricity through a resisting medium is a process in

which part of the energy of an electric current, flowing in a definite direc-
tion, is spent in imparting to the molecules of the medium that irregular

agitation which we call heat. To calculate from any hypothesis as to the
molecular constitution of the medium at what rate the energy of a given

current would be spent in this way, would require a far more perfect know-
ledge of the dynamical theory of bodies than we at present possess. It is
only by experiment that we can ascertain the laws of processes of which we

do not understand the dynamical theory.
    "We therefore define, as the resistance of a conductor, the ratio of the

numerical value of the electromotive force to that of the strength of the

current, and we have to determine by experiment the conditions which affect

the value of this ratio.

   Thus if E denotes the electromotive force acting from one electrode of the

conductor to the other, C the strength of the current flowing through the
conductor, and E. the resistance of the current, we have hy definition

The quantity R, which wo have defined as the resistance of the conductor,
can be determined onlj- by experiment. Its value may therefore, for any
thing we know, be affected by each and all of the physical conditions to
which the conductor may be subjected.

   Thus we know that the resistance is altered by a change of the temperature

of the conductor, and also by mechanical strain and by magnetization.

   The question which is now before us is whether the current itself is or is
not one of the phj-sical conditions which may affect the value of the resist-
ance ; and this question we cannot decide except by experiment.

    Let us therefore assume that the resistance of a given conductor at a
given temperature is a function of the strength of the current. Since the
resistance of a conductor is the same for the same current in whichever
direction the current flows, the expression for the resistance can contain
only even powers of the current.

    Let us sujjpose, therefore, that the resistance of a conductor of unit
length and unit section is

                             r (l+sc^+sV + &c.),

where r is the resistance corresponding to an infinitely small current, and
c is the current through unit of section, and s,s' iSrc. are small coefficients to bo
determined by experiment. The coefficients s, s' &c. represent the devia-
tions from Ohm's law. If Ohm's laAV is accurate, these coefficients are zero
also if e is the electromotive force acting on this conductor,

                            + +e=rc(l+sc^ s'c* &c.).

Now let us consider another conductor of the same substance whose length
A Eis L and whose section is ; then if is the electromotive force ou this con-

ductor, and e that on unit of length,

                                        E = L<'.

Also if C be the current throvigh the conductor and c that through unit of

area.

Uonce the resistance of this conductor will be

                             l+«^+?^ + &c.'

Now lot us suppose two conductors of the same material but of different

dimensions arranged in series and the same current passed through both :

where the suffixes indicate to which conductor the quantities belong. TIio

ratio of the resistances is

Hence if Ohm's law is not true, and if, therefore, any of the quantities s, s',
&c. have sensible values, the ratio of the resistances will depend on the

strength of the current.

Now the ratio of two resistances may be measured with great accuracy

by means of Wheatstone's bridge.   ^

                                  ..

We therefore arrange the bridge so that one branch of the current passes

first through a very fine wire a few centimetres long, and then through a
much longer and thicker wire of about the same resistance. The other

branch of the current passes through two resistances, equal to each other,
but much greater than the other two, so that very little of the heating-effect

of the current is produced in these auxiliary resistances.

The bridge is formed by connecting the electrodes of a galvanometer, one

to the junction of the fine wire and the thick one, and the other to a point

between the other two resistances.

  We have thus a method of testing the ratio of the resistances of the fine wire

to that of the thick one ; and by passing through the bridge sometimes a feeble

current and sometimes a powerful one, we might ascertain if the ratio differed

in the two cases.

But this direct method is rendered useless by the fact that the current

generates heat, which raises the temperature of both wires, but that of the

thin wire most rapidly ; and this makes it impossible to compare the effects
of strong and weak currents through a conductor at one and the same

temperature.

It is also useless to work with weak currents, as the effect dej^ends on

the square of the current, and is so small as to have escaped observation in

all ordinary experiments.

   Again, if we were to use a single very strong current acting for a very short
time, we should not be able to observe the galvanometer "in a satisfactory

manner. In fact it was found in the experiment that currents which lasted

for a sixtieth part of a second produced a heating-effect which interfered

with the measurements. The experiment was therefore arranged so that a

strong current and a weak one were passed through  the      bridge  alternately
                                                                                                           ;

and when the bridge was so arranged that the galvanometer was in equili-

brium, the direction of the weaker current was reversed. If Ohm's law were

not true, the condition of equilibrium for strong currents would be different

                                                                          e2

from that for weaker ones, so that when the weak cnrrents were reversed
there would be no longer equilibrium. Since, in point of fact, the reversal
of the weaker currents did not affect the cqiiilibrium, it follows that the
bridge was in equilibruun for the weaker currents as well as for the stronger
ones, and therefore the conditions were the same for both, and Ohm's law
is true to within the limits of error of tlie experiment. The mode in
which the actual strength of the currents was measured and tlie limits of
error ascertained, are described in the following Report by Mr. Chrystal.

               Report on the Second Experiment. By G. Chrystai,

    As has been pointed out by Professor Maxvv'ell, the change in the specific
resistance of a linear conductor, if there be any such change owing to increase
or decrease of the current, will depend on the amount of current that passes
through unit of area of its section ; so that if C be the whole current passing,

r the specific resistance for infinitely small current, I the length, lu the section,

and h a constant depending on the nature of the conductor, then the resis-
tances of the conductor will be

   It is clear, therefore, that by making up a resistance of very fine wire, say

^^ of an iuch in diameter, any such efiect as that we have been looking for

would be greatly multiplied. Accordingly the following experiment, the

principle of which is due to Professor Maxwell, was undertaken by the writer

of this Eeport.

galvanometer,

   Prom (1) it follows at once that tho greater E, the further to the right the

balance will bo, provided /i is >0.

   Let us now, instead of keeping up an electromotive force E constantly, make

an alternation some hundred times a second between an electromotive force

E and an electromotive force i/E *; then supposing each to operate for an equal

time, tho whole current through tho galvanometer is given by

 if the directions are opposite.

    It appears, therefore, as was obvious without calculation, that the values
 of X which give a balance are neither the same in the two cases (2) and (3),

 nor equal to that in the case of either electromotive force acting continuously,

.In fact the balance is an apparent one if jeo be >0, due to the fact that we
 are in case (2) as much under the balance for the larger electromotive force
 {qua effect on the galvanometer) as we are over that for the smaller, so that
 the needle is kicked equally this way and that so rapidly that it remains still.

 Similar reasoning would show that the balance for case (3) lies most to the
 right of all. In fact the values of x are :

=Smaller electromotive force alone x 4{Z+Ey.(P-?/^E-},

Case (2)                                                                                                                                                              x^ l{l+llf,VXl-y + 7f)W},

=Larger electromotive force alone x ^{Z+EyuP^E^},

Case (3)                                                                                                                                                              x = i{l+R^,ni+y-\-f)W},

Suppose now we find the balance for case (2) and then reverse our smaller

electromotive force ; the balance being thus disturbed, there will be a current

through the galvanometer                                                                                                                                    and in order to experiment at the greatest advan-

do ; and it is of course opposite in direction. If we make our alternations

quick enough the wire will not cool sensibly during the smaller current, nor

heat sensibly during the larger, but will settle down to a mean temjierature

between that due to the larger and smaller currents.

   In the above calculation we have supposed the resistance of the fine wire
for infinitely small currents to be that corresponding to this mean tempera-

ture, which will be constant throughout the experiment provided the electro-
motive forces do not vaiy.

    If, however, the alternations are not quick enough to ensure temperature-
equilibrium, then the thin wire will be hotter during the passage of the larger
current than it is during that of the smaller ; and there will be an effect

opposite to that we arc looking for, a result which appeared- in many of the

experiments.

   The experiment proved very difficult in practice, chiefly owing to the diffi-
culty experienced in getting a good alternator; and it was only after a great

Amany total or partial failures that any thing like success was attained.

sketch of the progress of the experiment, with an account of the more im-

portant difficulties, and how they were finally avoided or overcome, may be of

some interest.
    In the fii'st place the galvanometer indications in a Wheatstone's bridge,

arranged as above described, are somewhat peculiar.

   Suppose we are somewhere near a balance for some temperature of the

thin Avire above that of the room ; then on turning on the current there is a
sharp kick in one dii-ection, say to the right, then a slower but still tolerably
quick swing over to the left, and then a gradual subsidence back to zero or

thereabouts, which may last for haK an hour or longer. If this were due

solely to variation in the resistance of the thin wire the curve of time-resis-
tance would be of this nature

                                                                 Pig. G.

It had been found that the thin wire was very sensitive to air-currents,

merely blowing towards it from a considerable distance sending the spot off

the galvanometer-scale ; in fact to get any approach to steadiness the wire
had to be enclosed in a box, and latterly it was enclosed in a narrow tube,

and that again loosely rolled in a silk pocket-handkerchief, and the whole

enclosed in a box. It was therefore at first suspected that the peculiarity in

question was due to  air-currents                                             but some experiments with the wire in an
                                                                           ;

exhausted tube showed that it was due to some other cause. This cause was

found in the slow heating of the thick wire against which the thin wire was

balanced; and some obvious experiments were made confirming this con-

clusion*.

   * The behaviour of the galvanometer is therefore explained in this way :--The first sharp

   This slow variation of the balance was sometimes avoided by letting the
batteries work until it had died away, and sometimes it was allowed for by

suitably arranging the order of experiment.

   As it was of considerable importance to have a battery which could bo
relied on for constancy for some time, six large Dauiells were charged for
the purpose. They were cells intended for a Thomson's battery, but were
fitted up for convenience with copper plates IS inches square, upon which
was strewed sulphate of cojjper, which again was covered with a thin layer
of sawdust moistened with zinc sulphate, and on the top of this was placed a

heavy grating of zinc. Two piles were made consisting respectively of four

and two of these elements, and were used in most of the experiments. The
internal resistance of these piles ran to about 4 and 3 ohms respectively. The

electromotive force was repeatedly tested during the experiments.
   At first a " Morse key " worked rapidly by the hand was tried for an alter-

nator; this method, though leading to no definite results, seemed to show
the possibility of success. Then a rotating alternator driven by hand was
tried ; but it was found that the results though much better were still very
much disturbed by the irregularities of the driving. Next a rotating alter-
nator was made by Mr. Garnett and fitted to a Jenkins governor ; this also
after repeated trials was given up, the main difficulty being that of getting up
sufficient speed without introducing so much resistance as to go beyond the
range of the governor. Some of the results got with this arrangement Avere
fairly good, however, and will be given below. In the arrangement adopted
in the final exiieriments the alternation "was managed by means of a pair of

electric tuning-forks. For the use of these during the Lent term I am in-

debted to the kindness of Dr. Michael Poster.

tlie sudden rise of temperature causing a corresponding increase of resistance; the slow

development of heat in the thiek wire.

have thus alternately sent through the bridge certain definite fractions of

the whole current due to the large and small batteries. What fractions these

are will depend on the nicety with which the break is adjusted (with perfect
adjustment it would be one half of each), and also on the state of the mercury

surfaces and of the dippers. As may be imagined, the main difficulty of the
experiment lay in getting the dippers to work properly. Several sorts were
tried; plain copper amalgamated was found to act fairly well, but broad
spade-shaped pieces of platinum-foil answered on the whole best. The sur-
face of the mercury was covered with spirit, which is effectual so far in x>re-

n-i well, it was of vital importance to be able during the experiment to obtain
some measure of the amount of current that passed as representative of the
large and small current respectively ; for the experiment would obviously be
nugatory if, instead of the smaller current being nearly half the larger,
it became, owing to deterioration of contact in the cup S, equal to what ought

--to be the larger current. To provide for this the experiments were conducted

as follows : The balance was found, whether for larger currents alone or
smaller alone (acting directly or with the fork going), or for both together
in the same or in opposite directions ; then the block was moved as quickly
as possible 6 centims. from the position of balance, and the deflection which
then appeared was read off; this deflection is approximately proportional to
the current. Knowing then the electromotive force of either battery and its
internal resistance, one could not only tell v.'hether the currents wore passing

nearly in the right proportion, but also estimate roughly how much current

absolutely passed in each case. In some of the best experiments a more ac-

-- Dcurate method was adopted: The point was "put to earth," and the point

E connected by means of a long insulated wire with one pair of the quadrants

of a Thomson's electrometer in the flat of the laboratory below the room where
tlic experiment was carried on; the other pair of quadrants being "put to
earth," the deflection observed on the electrometer-scale was a direct measure

D --of the electromotive force between and E that is, of the quantity denoted

above by g^E.

    Before giving the quantitative results obtained from the most satisfactory

experiments, it maybe well to explain the principle on which these have been
selected from the others. In all the experiments quoted there was either

something remarkable, such as a high battery power, &c., or else the balances
were obtained imder very favourable circumstances, the spot of light being
very steady, and the proportions of current passing, as indicated by the
 sensibilities* or electrometer measurements, being near the theoretically best
amounts. Often where the breaks were not working satisfactorily, by work-
 ing quickly a qualitative experiment could be made, the behaviour of the
galvanometer indicating to an observer practised in the experiment that the
])roportions of current passing were not far wrong; and often part of an

experiment could be made perfectly satisfactorily, and then the apparatus
 Avould go out of order. But in all the experiments, whenever the results were

 at all intelligible (regular), the conclusion pointed to never differed from that
given by the best experiments, viz. either the balance for the currents in
 opposite direction lay more to the left than that for the currents in the same
 direction, or the two coincided. Of this the observer spared no trouble in
 assuring himself even in experiments that wero quantitatively utterly value-

 less.

    The first set of experiments quoted, which are not of much value quan-
titatively, may serve to illustrate what has just been said. In this set the
 time is given because the experiments 'were made during the slow heating-
 effect already alluded to. The spot of light was not perfectly steadj-, though
 much steadier for the -\ balances than for the others ; the bridge-reading

alternator was the rotating piece made by Mr. Garnett, driven by the

governor, which, judging by the regularity and smallness of the oscillations

of its brake-wheel, went very uniformly during the whole experiment. The

rate of revolution was about three turns (causing as many alternations)

+ --per second. The sensibilities for -f- -|- and  were respectively about 150

and 45 during the experiment, so'that the large and small currents would be

proportional to about 97 and 52 respectively. The fine wire Avas a small

length of German-silver wire -^-l^ in. in diameter, whose resistance was

about 7"3 ohms ; and the counter-balancing resistance was 7'3 ohms, taken

entirely from the small resistance-box. The governor being started, the

the thin wire was very nearly the same, and it was enclosed in a narrow tube.
The four Daniells had run down a good deal, being not quite equivalent to

deal of the effect duo to temperature oscillations already referred to. lu one
experiment in particular in wliicli a Grove's batter}^ was used, with alterna-
tions at the rate of only thirty per second, this effect came out very strong,

the spot swinging off the scale when the smaller battery was reversed.

    Without dwelling on these, I proceed to give the results of the final set of

experiments, which were in every way by far the most satisfactory.

    In the three following experiments the Daniells were used as before ; the
alternations were made by means of the tuning-forks at the rate of GO per
second. Three wires were experimented on, a platinum, a German-silver,
and an iron wire. The balancing resistance was the German-silver bobbin
with small resistance-box, which was on the left, except in the second experi-

Dment, where it Avas on the right. The electromotive force between and F

was now found directly by the electrometer ; as a control the sensibilities

are given as well. New spade-pointed platinum dippers were used, and

answered admirably during the whole time the experiments were going on.

 was led to try a third experiment in verification of Ohm's law. If there be
 a periodic variation of the primary of an induction-coil, the time integral of
 the electromotive force in the secondary through one complete oscillation
 will be zero ; but if the variation consist of a sharp break, although this
 law holds, yet the oscillation in the secondary may be divided into two parts,

 in one of which the maximum intensity is very much greater than in the

 other. If it be true, then, that a more intense current encounters less
 resistance than a less intense current, clearly the law above stated can no
 longer hold ; the law has, in fact, been deduced on the supposition that the

resistance is independent of the strength of the current.

   It follows, therefoi'e, that if we send the induction- currents from the
secondary of an induction-coil, whose primary is made and broken by a tuning-
fork, througli a helix of fine wire to make sure of bringing out the weefi'ects

are looking for, then the needle of a galvanometer introduced into the
secondary will bo deflected so as to indicate a current in the direction of the
current due to breaking the primary.

    Certain anomalous, and at first sight contradictory, results led the writer
to study the behaviour of a galvanometer under these circumstances. The
result was the suggestion of a theory which explained the anomalies com-
pletely, and indicated the existence of certain other phenomena which were
afterwards observed.

    The results are, so far as the writer has been able to learn, partly new.
Although not of suificicni importance in connexion with the present subject
to require detailed mention here, yet it was thought best to state the results

so far as they bear on the question, reserving a detailed account for publica-
tion elsewhere *.

   It was found that, under the circumstances indicated above, the indication
of a galvanometer is a function of the ratio of the strengths of the magnetic
field when there is no current and when the currents are passing, and also
of the position of equilibrium of the needle when there is no current.

   Theorj!- and observation give alike, among others, the following peculiari-

ties :

    1. If the ratio of the magnetic forces due to the currents to that acting
on the needle when there is no current does not exceed a certain quantity,

<then if the position of rest of axis of the needle is inclined at an angle a ( 90°)

to the plane of the coil-windings, the effect of the alternating currents is to

increase that angle, so that, according as the needle is deflected one way or
the other by means of the deflecting magnet, we get opposite eflfects.

   The eff'ect is zero when n is zero.

    2. If the above-mentioned ratio exceeds a certain value, the position of the

=needle parallel to the windings (i. e. for a 0) becomes unstable, and there now

appear two positions of equilibrium of equal inclination cither way to the
coU-windings. Either of these the needle will take up and keep if brought

there with sufficiently small velocit}^
   The greater the ratio, the more nearly these two positions approach to

parallelism with the plane of the coil-windings.

   The last-mentioned phenomenon was described long ago by Poggendorfi",
under the name of ' ' doppelsinnige Ablenkung," and was and has been regarded
apparently as an unstable phenomenon.

   The first-mentioned form of the phenomenon has not, so far as the writer
knows, been hitherto described anywhere.

of constant direction on the alternating current, the writer has never been
able to detect any effect that could not be explained by 1>he' above results.

He has not been able to use a sine-inductor as yet, so that a complete discus-

sion of Dr. Schuster's results from this point of view has not been possible.
   Tho strong analogy of the phenomena to those obtained by Dr. Schuster,

and the fact that it has been found possible to produce the phenomenon in
three difierent galvanometers (it is of importance to remark that the needle
was elongated in all cases where the effect was strong), must, however, be
regarded as affecting tho probability of conclusions drawn from experiments
of this kind about the truth of Ohm's law.

Report of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. H. F. Barnes, H. E.
   Dresser (Secretary), T. Harland, J. E. Harting, T. J. Monk,
   Professor Newton, and the Rev. Cauou Tristram, appointed for
    the purpose of inquiring into the possibility of establishing a " Close
    Time " for the 2^'>'otection of indigenous animals, and for watching

    Bills introduced into Parliame^it affecting this subject.

Your Committee has the pleasure of stating that Mr. Chaplin, II.P. for Mid

Lincolnshire, lost no time in fulfilling his promise, announced in its List
lleport, and immediately on the meeting of Parliament introduced into the

House of Commons the Bill for the Preservation of Wild Powl, which had

been prepared by your Committee, and has been referred to in its former

Reports.

    In order to aid Mr. Chaplin's efforts and to explain the objects of tho Bill,
yoiir Committee in February last issued and extensively circulated the

following statement :

    "The Committee deems it expedient to offer a summary of its former

Reports, and a statement of its present views, in regard to the probability
of action being taken in Parliament during the ensuing Session for the
attainment of further protection of birds.

  --" It has long since been stated by the Committee and the statement is
--beyond contradiction that the birds which are comprehended under the

common designation of Wild Powl have, of all others, with the exception of
Birds-of-prey, most rapidly diminished in numbers throughout the United
Kingdom, and it cannot be doubted that their decrease is still going on.

    " The reasons which hinder the Committee from recommending any legis-
lative protection to Birds-of-prey are almost too obvious to need explanation.
The Committee, while believing the existence of such birds in certain
 districts, and in numbers which are not excessive, is beneficial, is aware
that the contrary opinion is very strongly upheld by a large class of persons,
 and is fully persuaded that were it possible to pass an Act for the protection
 of these birds, its enforcement in a single instance would give the signal for
 an agitation for its repeal, which would seriously damage the cause of bird-

 protection in general.

    " On the other hand, no charge of injuriousness has ever been brought^

--or, if brought, could possibly be maintained against AVild Fowl as a whole
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

 the population, and their utility as an article of food to almost the whole
 community, render their protection highly desirable from an economical point

of view. The notorious and rapid decrease in their numbers is to be ascribed

--to causes tha't diay be classed under t^yo heads : (1) ' Indirect ' and (2)

' Direct.'

    " (1) The indirect causes of the decrease of Wild Fowl are attributable to
the diminution of their breeding-haunts by draining, the reclamation of
waste lauds, and agricultural improvements generally ; and with these it
would of course not only be impossible, but manifestly improper, for the
legislature to interfere, for with them the prosperity of the country at largo
is intimately bound up. So far, then, as regards thdr effects, the birds must

take their chance.

    " (2) The direct causes, on the other hand, arc as plainly capable of

control, for they are attributable to tlie destruction of the breeding-stock,

and chiefly by the gun. As soon as Inrds pair in the spring they lay aside
much of their habitual caution, and become easy victims to the gunner.
Long after the pairing-season has begun our markets arc plentifully stocked
with Wild Fowl of every description ; and it is obvious that every pair of
birds killed at that time of year signifies the destruction, of a whole brood, as

well as that of its intending parents.

   " Wild-Fowl shooting gives, as has boon above stated, employment to a
large number of men, who make a profession of it. These men, however,
are accustomed to certain restraints in pursuing tlieir vocation. They are

all compelled to take out a gun-license, and many of them are aware that

they are prohibited from exercising their calling in certain waters and over

certain lands. The notion of restraint to them is, therefore, not new ; and

the Committee believes that the most intelligent of them would gladly re-
cognize the propriety of a well-considered and strijigeut measure, that by
effectually protecting Wild Fowl during the breeding- season would secure to
them a greater abundance at other times of the year.

   " The Wild Fowl, for whose protection a more stringent measure is now
about to be proposed, are, it is true, already named in the ' Wild-Birds Pro-

tection Act;' but owing to their marketable value being greatly in excess of

--the penalties which that Act prescribes very projierly, may be, in regard to
--the other birds it names they enjoy little or no real protection tlierefrom.

    " The great success which has attended the working of the ' >Sea-Birds
Frescrvation Act,' in which the penalties are much higlior than in the ' "\^'ild-
Birds Protection Act,' encourages the Committee to liclievc that an Act on
the same principle of the former, but aj^plied to Wild Fowl, would be equally
successful; and to this end the Committee recommend the passing of such
a Bill as was introduced by Mr. Andrew Johnson in 1872. This Bill, it will
be remembered, was the foundation of the existing 'Wild-Birds Protection
Act,' but was so entirely altered in its passage through Parliament as to
become useless for the protection of the group of birds it was at fii-st intended

to protect.

   "The 'Wild-Birds Protection Act' may we'll be left as it is, since public

opinion was, and is, decidedly- in favour of some such legislation. Its failing
to protect Wild Fowl efficiently gives no room for its repeal ; but the Com-
mittee regards it as being virtually ineffective to produce any practical good.

    " The Committee thinks it necessary to state once more, that of the Small
Birds which so deeply engage the sympathies of many of the public, there
are but few kinds which have been proved, on any good evidence, to bo
diminishing in numbers, and that the decrease of these is owing much less
to any direct destruction or persecution than to indirect causes, such as have
been already referred to, and declared to be uncontrollable by the legislature.

          ON THE DESIRABILITY OF ESTABLISHING A '' CLOSE TIME."          G5

   The diminution of such birds as the Wheatear, the Goldfinch, and Linnet can

   be immediately traced to the breaking up, and bringing under cultivation, of
   commons, and so probably of the rest ; while, on the other hand, it is obvious

   that many kinds of Small Birds have largely increased in number owing to

   the spread of plantations, and the security from molestation during the

   breeding-season they enjoy through the incessant attention given to the

   preservation of game.

   "At the same time the Committee is of opinion that some steps for the

   Regulation of Bird-catchers might well be taken, with the approval not only

   of the general public, but of the better class of bird-catchers themselves

   and, should success attend its present attempt, the Committee would readily

   direct its efforts to that object."

   Your Committee has the gratification of reporting that the opposition which

   the Bill encountered in the House of Commons, though seriously intended,

   Was happily overcome by the good management of Mr. Chaplin and his

   Aseconder, Mr. Rodwell, Q.C.         division was taken on the motion for the

   Second Eeading, when the numbers against it were 13, and in its favour 337

   --· an almost absolute majority of the whole House.

   In deference to certain objections which were raised in Committee, Mr.

   Cha2)lin consented to an alteration of the original draft Bill as regards the

   days when the proposed " Close Time " should begin and end. Your Com-

   mittee cannot wholly approve of this change ; but as it does not affect the

   length of the season, the modification seems not to be very important, while

   Mr. Chaplin's adroit acceptance of it unquestionably saved the Bill.

   No further alteration was made. The Bill, having passed the Commons,

   was kindly taken charge of in the Upper House by Lord Henniker, and

   finally received the Eoyal Assent on the 2-tth of July.

   In congratulating all who have at heart the protection of indigenous

   animals in this happy result, your Committee desires to point out that their

   most sincere thanks are due to the nobleman and gentlemen already named,

   as well as to others who aided the passage of the Bill through both Houses,

   and, in particular, the efforts of Lord Walsingham deserve especial recognition.

   With regard to the taking of any further steps, your Committee can only

   suggest the possibility of something being done in the direction indicated by

   the last paragrajih of the foregoing statement. The difficulties, however, in

   the way of passing any measure for the Regulation of Bird-catchers, which

   should be at once effectual and acceptable to Parliament, seem to be very

   great, and your Committee is not sanguine of the success of any immediate

   attempt to attain this end.

   The Sea-Birds Preservation Act continues to work satisfactorily on the

   whole, though your Committee has reason to fear that its provisions have

   been disregarded in certain places. Some time has elapsed since any prose-

   cution under it has taken place ; and its enforcement in a few instances in

   the course of the next j^ear may be needed to show that it cannot be violated

   wi:h impunity. To this object your Committee, if reappointed, will give its

   attention ; meanwhile it may be observed that the Act is very favourably

   regarded in most places, and that, by authority of its third section, the

   Secretary of State for the Home Department has, on the recommendation of

   the justices of the East Biding of York in Quarter Sessions assembled, ex-
   tended the "Close Time" on the coast of that county from the 1st to the

   15th of August.                      ,

   Your Committee respectfully urges its reappointment.

66 REPORT--1876.

Report of the Committee, consisting of James E. Napier^ F.R.S., Sir

  W. Thomson, F.R.S., W. Froude, F.R.S., and Osborne Reynolds

    (Secretary), appointed to investigate the effect of Propellers on the

Steei'ing of Vessels.

                       [Plate I.]

The Committee commenced operations by printing the following Circular, and
sending copies of it to the Admiralty and to those shipowners with whom

the individual members of the Committee were personally acquainted, or

those who in their opinion were likely to assist in the investigation :

           " The British Association foe the Abvancement oe Science.

                       " Experiments on tlie Turning of Screw Steamers.

     " At the Meeting of the British Association in Bristol last year, a paper
 was read by Professor Osborne Eeynolds, in which it was shown, from ex-
 periments upon models, that in a steamer when the screw is in motion, the
 direction in which the rudder tends to turn the ship depends on whether the
 screw is driving ahead or astern, and is independent of the actual motion of
 the ship through the water ; for instance, if when a ship has headway on
 the screw is] reversed, then the action of the rudder is the same in direction
 as that of a ship going astern ; or if the ship have sternway on, and the
 screw be started to drive her ahead, then the rudder acts as if slio were going

 ahead.

     " After the discussion of the paper, Mr. James R. Napier, Sir William
 Thomson, Mr. "W. Froude, and Professor Eeynolds were appointed a Com-
 mittee to carry the investigation further, and particularly to ascertain if the
 same results would be obtained when the expei'imcnts were made with full-

 sized ships.

      " In order to collect sutHcient data to establish a general conclusion, the
 Committee are anxious to obtain the assistance of such shipowners and

 captains of ships as may be willing to aid them.
     " The Committee accordingly ask that certain trials and observations may

  be made, and the results, together with the name, size, tonnage, and condi-
  tion of loading of the ship, as well as the depth of immersion of the screw,

 the date and name of the officer in charge, may be forwarded to Professor
 Reynolds, Owens College, Manchester, or to any of the Members of Com-

  mittee.

     " It is also particularly requested that the kind of screw and the number
 of blades may be stated, and whether the screw is right- or left-handed. By
 a right-handed screw is imderstood one in which the uj^per blades move from
 port to starboard when driving the ship ahead.

  --" The following are the trials requested :

     " Trial I. That when the ship is going full speed ahead, the screw should

- be suddenly reversed and the rudder put hard over, as if to turn the ship to

 starboard of her course, and careful notice taken as to the way in which the

--ship turns before all headway is lost.
     " Trial II. The same repeated with the rudder set in the opposite

  direction.

  --" Trial III. That when the ship is going fast astern the screw should

 suddenly be started to drive her ahead, and the rudder put hard over to the
 same side as in Trial I.

  --"Trial lY. Trial III. repeated with the rudder. in the opposite direction.

 --" Trial Y. ^That the ship should bo driven full speed ahead with the helm

amidships, and notice taken as to the direction in which the ship turns
under the action of the screw,

 --" Trial VI. That the ship should be driven full speed ahead, then the

screw reversed, with the helm amidships, and notice taken in which direc-

tion the ship turns."

" May 3, 1876."

    After sending the Circular the Committee received a communication from
the Secretary to the Admiralty, to the eifect that the Admiralty had ordered

the experiments to be made, and that the results should be forwarded.

   As the result of their application to private owners, the Committee obtained
the use of three vessels, upon which the following trials were made.

   Experhneiits made with the ' T'aJetta,' belonging to the Earl of Glasgow,
Captain E. Hunter, on the 6th June, between Weniys Bay and the Cumbrae.

   The ' Yaletta ' measures 80 tons, and was drawing during the trials
5' 6" foi'ward and G' G" aft. Her screw, which is right-handed, is 5' 6" in
diameter, and during the trials was immersed about 1' ; it is 3-bladed, and

has a pitch of 8' 6". When at full speed the ' Valetta ' makes about 9|

knots an hour.
   During the trials the seconds were called out by Mr. James E. Napier.

Mr. Bottomley, who was acting for Sir William Thomson, watched the angles
thi-ough which the boat turned, by means of a dumb compass, while the

signals for turning and stopping the vessel were given by Professor Eeynolds.
   Tiie first trial was of the effect which the screw exerted to turn the ship

with the helm amidships. When at full speed she turned to port at the rate

of about 7° per minute, or, as it is usually expressed, she carried a port helm.

However, as the speed of the engines was reduced the tendency to turn the
ship to port was reduced, and when going very slow (about 5 miles an hour)

the ship turned slightly in the opposite direction. When going fast the

screw churned air into the water, but not when it was going slow.
    The effect of the screw to turn the ship with the helm amidship, although

appreciable, was not of sufficient magnitude to be taken into account in the

results of the subsequent experiment. And as this effect was almost the

same with the wind on cither bow, it was evident that, although the wind
was blowing with some little force, its effect to turn the vessel was also

unimportant.

    These preliminaries having been settled, the ship was driven fuU speed
ahead, then the screw reversed as suddenly as possible, and immediately the
engines began to turn astern the rudder was put hard over. At first on
reversal the engines turned but slowly, and it was not until the boat had lost
some of her way that they turned full speed astern.

   Four observations were taken in this way with the helm to port, two with
head to wind, and two before the wind ; and similar observations were taken
with the helm to starboard. All four observations with the helm to port
gave nearly the same results, and so with the helm to starboard.

    The mean results were as follows :
    With the helm ported (which, had the engines been going ahead, would

have brought the ship's head round to starboard at a rate of nearly 2° a
second) the vessel at first, while the screw was turning but slowly, com-
menced turning to starboard, and had turned through 5'^ in 9 seconds ; she

then commenced turning to port; and in IG seconds more, when she had

nearly lost all way, she had returned 13° to port or about 8° to port of her
                                                                                                      F2

original direction, i. e. iu the opposite way to that in which she would have

turned had the screw been kept on ahead.
   With the helm to starboard, at the end of 10 seconds she had turned

through 6° to port, and in 14 seconds more, when she had nearly lost way,
she had come back 14° to starboard or S° to starboard of her original direc-
tion ; that is, as before, in the opposite way to that in which she would have

turned had the screw been kept on ahead.
    With this ship, therefore, althougli the reversing of the screw did not at

once reverse the action of the rudder, it greatly reduced its effect, and
reversed it in time for the ship to have turned S° out of her course before she

--had come to rest that is, 8° out of the direction iu which she headed on

the reversal of her screw ; and considering that, during the 25 seconds in which
she was stopping, had her screw been kept on ahead she Avould have turned

through some 50°, the effect of reversing the engines was to bring the ship

some 58° out of the direction she might have occupied.

   Experiments with the Hopper Barge, No. 12, belonging to the Clyde

Navigation Trust, Captain J. Barrie, on June 7, off lulcreggan, Rosneath.
   These experiments were conducted in a similar manner to those on the

' Valetta,' the same members of the Committee taking part in them.

   The barge when loaded carries 400 tons of mud, is 140 feet long, was
drawing during the first set of experiments 11' 6" aft and 9' 6" forward, and
when light, during the second set, 8' 2" aft or 4 ft. forward. The top of the
propeller is 8' 6" from the bottom of the keel. The screw, which is right-

handed, has three blades, and is 8 feet in diameter and 16 feet pitch.
   The first set of experiments were made with the barge head to windward,

the wind being of much the same force as on the previous daj'. The mud

was then discharged, and the barge put before the wind, and the experiments

repeated.

   When loaded and going to windward with the helm amidships, the barge

sheered first to port and then to starboard. This was apparently owing to
the screw churning the water intermittently ; when the wake was apparently
clear the boat turned to starboard, and when the screw was churning air

into the water she turned to port.

   When the screw was reversed with full way on, and afterwards the helm

put hard over either to port or starboard, the action of the rudder was

always reversed, and was very decided. It required 1 minute for the screw

to bring the boat  to  rest,  and during that  time she  turned from  35° to  60°
                                                                                                 ;

moving slowly at first, aud more rapidly as her speed diminished.

The reverse action of the rudder Avas therefore much more decided than iu

the case of the ' Valetta,' which was accounted for by the fact that the screw

was reversed to full speed at once, the engineer being an old locomotive

engine-driver accustomed to reverse suddcnlj', besides which the boat being

much heavier allowed more time for the operation.
   When the boat was going full speed astern, the screw reversed to full speed

ahead, the action of the rudder was the same in direction as if she had been
going ahead, but it was very slow.

   When the bai-gc.was steaming full speed ahead with the rudder hard over,

she turned at the rate of 1° in 1 second.

   With this vessel, therefore, the effect of reversing the screw wof. to cause
her to turn through more than 30° from the direction in which she
headed when the reverse action set in ; and considering that in the same
time she would have turned through 00° in the opposite direction had the

The draught of the vessel was 10 feet aft and 8' 2" forward. She was

fitted with a Griffith's screw 7' 1" in diameter and 12' pitcli. The experi-

ments were witnessed by Mr. James E. Napier and his son, Mr. Eobert T.

Napier. "When the vessel was going full speed ahead (about 10 knots) the

engines were reversed, and the helm immediately put to starboard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 the ves-

sel turned to starboard until her forward way was lost, the time between the

reversal of the engines and the stopping of the ship being about 1 minute.

   When the vessel was going full speed ahead the helm was set to port, and

shortly after the screw reversed. The vessel turned to starboard at first,

and then to port until all way was lost. The turning to starboard at first

was the natural result of the helm having been ported before the screw waa

reversed.

   In the trials on this ship no measurements were made of the angles
turned through. The direction of turning, however, was the same as be-

fore, the reversing of the screw at once reversing the eflfect of the rudder.

   In all three of these vessels, therefore, the same effect on the steering waa
produced by the reversing of the screw when the vessel was at full speed.

   The importance of this effect may perhaps be best seen from the diagrams

(Plate I.), showing the various positions occupied by the ' Valetta ' and the
barge compared with those they would have occupied had the screws not been

reversed.

    In these diagrams the directions of the vessels correspond with the actual
measurements during the trials ; the positions and distances travelled being

estimated from the known speed of the vessels. It had been the intention

of the Committee to use one of Mr. Napier's pressure logs in order to ascer-

tain exactly the positions of the vessels during the trial, but this intention

was not carried out.

DiagTam 1 shows the courses run by two ships after the reversing of the

screw until they had lost all way compared with the courses they would have

run had they continued under full steam, the helm being hard to port.

  A glance at this diagram is sufficient to show what a fatal mistake it must

be when a collision is imminent to reverse the screw, and then use the rudder

as if the ship would answer to it in the usual manner.

 --But perhaps, as regards collisions, the most important result is that

shown in diagram 2 namely, the positions of the ships when they have not

lost more than half their way, and when, as regards the distance run, the

effect of reversing the screw is but small.

As is shown in this diagram, it appears that whether the reversing of the

screw reverse the action of the rudder or not, the rudder is nearly powerless

to turn the ship, and that she will turn not only more rapidly, but in less

room when going full speed ahead.

Before closing their Eeport, the Committee desire to express their thanks

to the Earl of Glasgow, the Clyde Navigation Trust, and His G race the Duke

of Argyll, for the use of their vessels, and to the officers and crews who

assisted in making the arrangements and conducting the experiments.

70 EEPORT--1876.

On the Investigation of the Steering Qualities of Ships.

               By Prof, Osborne Reynolds.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in exicnso.]

The primary object of using steam power in ships is to enable them to pass

quickly over long distances. Under normal circumstances rapidity aud cer-

tainty iu manoeuvring are matters of secondary importance ; but circum-

stances do arise under -which these powers are of vital importance. Experi-

ence has taught those who go down to the sea in steam-ships that their

greatest danger is that of collision ; and fogs are feared much more than

storms. That there must always be danger when long ships are driven at

full speed through crowded seas iu a dense fog caimot be doubted ; but this

' lugcr is obviously increased manyfold when those iu command of the ships

are under the impression that a certain motion of the helm will turn the

ship in the opposite direction to that in which it does turn.

The uncertainty which at present exists iu the manoeuvring of large ships

is amply proved by the numerous collisions which have occirrred between the

ships of our own navy while endeavouring to execute ordinary movements

under the most favourable circumstances, aud M'ith no enemy before them,

·xhcse accidents may be, and have been, looked upon as indicating imperfec-

tions iu the ships or the manner in which they were handled ; but it must

be admitted that the ships are the best and best found iu the world, aud

that they are commanded by the most skilful and highly trained seamen
alive. And if peaceable ships fail in their manoeuvres when simply trying

not to hurt each other, what will be the case of iighting ships when trying

to do all thoy can to destroy each other ? If the general impression as to

the important part which the ram is to play in the naval combats of the

fature is ever reahzed, then certainty iu manoeuvring must not ouly be of

very great importance (this it has always been in sea fights), but it must

occupy the very first place in the fighting qualities of the ship.

   Now the results of the investigation of the effect of reversing the j^ro-

pellers on the action of the rudder appear to show that, however capricious

the behaviour of ships has hitherto seemed, it is in reahty subject to laws

and that by a series of careful trials the commander of a ship may inform
himself how his ship will behave iindcr all circumstances.

The experiments of the Committee on largo ships have completely esta-

myblished the fact to which it was  principal object last year to direct atten-

tion, namely, that the reversing of the screw of a vessel with full way on
very much diminishes her steering-power, and reverses what little it leaves

so that where a collision is imminent, to reverse the screw and use the rudder

as if the ship would answer to it in the usual manner is a certain way of

bringing about the collision. Aud to judge from the accounts of collisions,

this is precisely what is done in nine cases out of ten. In the paper of

to-day I find the following (August 22, 1876) :

   "The Fatal CoUision off Ailsa Craig.--The Board of Trade inquiry into
the collision between the steamer ' Owl ' and the schooner-yacht ' Madcap

was continued at Liverpool j^esterday. Two passengers by the ' Owl ' were

recalled, and spoke to some of the facts of the collision. The night was not

misty, though some rain had fallen. They saw the green light of the yacht

shiniug brightly after the collision. "VVilham Maher, third officer of the

' Owl,' said it was the chief officer's watch at the time of the collision.

There were five able seamen in the watch. Witness and the chief officer
              ON THE STEERING QUALITIES OF SHIPS.                      71

were on the bridge. One man was on the look-out from the starboard side

of the bridge. His ordinary place was on the forecastle-head, but he was
not placed there that night, as there was a heavy head sea, and the vessel
was shipping water. His attention was called to a light by the look-out

man. It was almost ahead about a mile and a half off. He could not at

first distinguish whether it Avas red or green, as it was dim ; but when he
made it out to be a green light it bore two to three points on the port bow,

and it was only three or four lengths off. He heard no order given to the
man at the wheel when the light was first reported ; but when witness found

that it was a green light he ordered the helm hard aport. If the steamer
had starboarded at this time she would have gone right over the yacht. The
' Owl ' had been going at the rate of six or seven knots ; but when she col-
lided there was Jio way on her, the engines having been reversed. After tho
yacht went down the captain ordered a boat to be got out, but subsequently
countermanded the order, on the ground that more lives would be lost, as it

was not fit to go out. At the close of his examination the witness stated
that he would not have gone out in a boat on such a night as that, even if

--the captain had ordered him a remark which appeared to greatly astonish

the nautical assessors."

  Ho ported his helm to bring his ship round to starboard, but he also

reversed his screw ; and as he says nothing about having again starboarded

his helm, it would appear that from the time of reversing the screw until
the collision (time enough to stop the ship), she had moved straight for-

ward or inclined to port. Had ho not reversed his screw, but kept on full

speed, it is clear the collision could not have happened, for at the time tho

collision did happen his ship would have been more than her own length

away from the spot where the collision occurred. Ho admitted himself that

to have starboarded his helm must have brought about the collision, so he
ported his helm and reversed his screw, which, as it had the same effect, did

bring about the collision.

   From the Committee's report just read, it appears that a ship will turn
faster, and for an angle of 80°, in less room when driving full speed ahead,
than with her engines reversed, even if the rudder is rightly used. Thus
when an obstacle is too near to admit of stopping the ship, then, as was done

in the case of the ' Ohio,' mentioned in my paper last year, the only chance

is to keep the engines on full speed ahead, and so to give the rudder an

opportunity of doing its work.

These general laws are of the greatest importance, but they apply in dif-

ferent degrees to different ships ; and each commander should determine for

Ahimself how his ship will behave.  ship's ordinary steering-power may

soon be learnt in general use, but not so the effect of stopping ; there is
thought to be a certain risk in suddenly reversing the engines, which any ono

in charge of a ship wiU shrink from, unless he knows it is recognized as part

of his duty.

It is also highly important that the effect of the reversal of the screw

should be generally recognized, particularly in the laAV courts ; for in tho
present state of opinion on the subject, there can be no doubt that judgment

would go against any commander who had steamed on ahead, knowing that
by so doing he had the best chance of avoiding a collision, or who had
ported his helm in order to bring his ship's head round to port, with the

screw reversed. It seems to me, therefore, that it would be well if steps
could be taken by this Association to bring the matter prominently before

the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, and those concerned in navigation.
--73 REPORT 1876.

So far as the capabilities of each individual ship are concerned, there is no

insuperable difficulty or risk about the experiments, and to have determined

these will be a great point. When the officers know exactly what can be

done in the way of tui-niug their ships, and how to do it, the chances of

accidents must be greatly reduced.

But at all events for fighting ships it is desirable that the officers should

have experience beyond the mere turning powers of their own ships. AVhen

two ships are mana3uvring so as to avoid or bring about a collision, each

commander has to take into account the movements of his opponent. To

enable him to do this with readiness, it would be necessary to have friendly

Aencounters.  fight between two ships Avhose captains had never before

fought, would be like a tournament between two novice knights who had

never practiced with pointless spears ; and such a contest, although not un-
equal, must be decided by chance rather than skill.

Unfortunately sham fights or tournaments between ships with blunt rams

would bo about as dangerous as a real fight ; and the chance of an accident

would be far too great for such friendly tournament, however important,

ever to become an essential part of the training of a naval officer, as they

were of the knights of old. Por although, should war arise, the danger from

want of experience may be even greater than the danger of an accident in

gaining such experience by friendly fights, yet, as the chance of. war is

always remote, the former risk would be preferred ; and this is not all.

As yet there has been no such thing as a ramming fight between steam-

ships ; so that not only are our officers without actual experience, but even

the rules by which they are instructed to act (the rules of naval tactics) aro

based entirely on theoretical considerations, and hence are very imperfect.

  Now there appears to me to be a means by which experience of the

counter-manoeuvring powers of ships, as well as the manoeuvring powers of

single ships, could be ascertained without any of the risk and but little of

the cost attending on the trials of large ships, and which, if not equal to an

actual fight, would be verj^ useful as a means of training the officers.

If small steam-launches were constructed similar to the ships, so that

they represented these ships on a given scale (say one tenth linear measure),

and tlieir engines wei'c so adjusted that they could only steam at what we
may call the speed corresponding to that of the larger ships, then two

launches would manoeuvre in an exactly similar manner to the large ships,

turning in one tenth the room ; and the time which the manoeuvres with

the launches would take would only be about half that occuined by similar

manoeuvres with full-sized ships. The only points in which it would bo

necessary that the model should represent the ship would be in its shape
under water and as regards the longitudinal disposition of its weights. The

centre of gravity should occupy the same position amidships, and the longi-

tudinal radius of gyration of the model should bear the same proportion to

that of the ship as the other linear dimensions. In other respects the model
might be made as was most convenient. It might be made of wood, and so
strengthened that two models might run into each other with impunity.

   There would not be much difficulty in so strengthening the models, as the

speed of the models would be very small. For instance, if the speed of the
ship were 13| knots, then that of the model would be 4| knots.

   The study of the quahties of ships from experiments on their models has
not until recent years led to any important results. But this in great part
was owing to the fact that proper account had not been taken of the effect

of the Avave caused by the ship and the consequent resistance. It was not

kuown that the waves set up by the model bear the same relation to the

size of the model as the waves set up by the ship do to the ship when, and
only when, the speed of the model is to the speed of the ship in the ratio of

the square root of the ratio of their lengths.
    Since this fact has been recognized, most important information has been

obtained by experimenting on models. Mr. Froude, by recognizing this law,
has been able to bring the comparison of ships by means of their models to

such a degree of perfection, that he can now predict with certainty the com-

parative and actual resistance of ships before they are constructed, and the
great practical value of his results have been recognized by the Admiralty.

   What I propose is virtually to extend these experiments on models so as
to make them embrace the steering-powers of ships as well as their resis-
tances. The manner of experimenting would have to be somewhat altered.
Steam-launches would have to be substituted for dummy models ; but the

principle of the experiments would have to remain the same, and the speed
of the launches must be regulated by the same law as that of the models.

   The turning qualities of such launches might be verified by comparing
them with the turning qualities of the ships as found by actual experiment
and then the models might be handed over to the officers of the ships, and
they might practice encounters and manoeuvres until they knew not only
what they could do with their ships, but what it was best to do in order to
outmanoeuvre each other, and this without any cost or risk.

    The behaviour of the models would be in all respects similar to that of the
ships, the only difference being that the manoeuvres would be on a smaller
scale ; and the scale of the manoeuvres would be the same as that of the
models, so that the step from the models to the large ships would be easy
and familiarity with the working of the ships as well as the models under
ordinary circumstances would prepare the officers for using the ships in an
actual fight as they have been accustomed to use the models in their friendly
encounters. The scheme here proposed has its parallel in military schools.
Although " autumn manoeuvres " and sham fights afford soldiers a much
better opportunity of preparing themselves for battle than any thing at
present within reach of the sailors, still the war game appears to be
growing in favour, and this is nothing more than practising manoeuvres in

miniature.

   Independently of their value as a means of training naval officers, such
models would afford a means of studying naval tactics. From them might be
learnt the way in which a ship should strive to approach another of nearly
equal power and speed, so as to use her ram to the greatest advantage ; and
of this as yet but very little can be known ; and, except on models, it can
only be learnt from experiments oji the ships.

   Important as are the laws which have been verified by the Committee on
the steering of screw-steamers, it appears to me that the most important
lesson to be learnt from their investigation is, that there is nothing capri-
cious in the behaviour of these ships. To realize the value of this lesson
the investigation must be followed up ; and it appears that the best way to
do this would be by the aid of model launches on the plan thus roughly

sketched out.
--74 REPORT 1876.

Seventh Report on Earthqualces in Scotland, drawn up by Dr. Bryce,
    F.G.S., F.R.S.E. The Committee consists of Dr. Bryce, F.G.S., Sir

   W. Thomson, F.R.S., J. Brough, G. Forbes, F.R.S.E., D. Milne-
   Home, F.R.S.E., and P. Drummond.

Tke state of quiescence alluded to in last year's Report has suffered
scarcely any interruption during the current year. No movement has oc-
curred of sufficient intensity to affect any of the instruments employed by
the Committee for testing the shocks. The Association wiU be aware that

these are the seismometer, constructed on the principle of the inverted pen-
dulum, which is placed in the tower of the parish church of Cpmrie, and two
sets of upright cylinders, described in last year's Report, Avhich stand on
boards on the sanded floor of a building erected two years ago by the Asso-
ciation upon a site, half a mile west of the Comrie church, kindly granted by

P. Drummond, Esq., of Dunearn, in the grounds surrounding his house.
This building stands in the Comrie valley, on a boss of rock of the same
kind of slate of which the adjacent hills and ridges arc composed, and which

can be traced into continuity with those on both sides of the valley. It Avas
therefore expected that cylinders so placed would readily respond to any
movement affecting the rocks on either side of the valley, more especially
as the centre or focus from which it has hitherto been considered that the
movements have emanated is at no great distance on the north side of the

valley.

    This expectation has not been realized, inasmuch as two slight shocks were
experienced on the 14th and 16th of January, in the morning and afternoon,
without affecting the seismometer or the cylinders, even those of smallest dia-
meter, which a very slight movement is sufficient to lay prostrate in the sand.
It is easy to see that a very extreme sensibility must be avoided in order to

--guard against the effects of other disturbing causes as a storm of wind, a

peal of thunder near at hand, or a heavy footfall on the rock outside ; and
hence that an undulation, propagated from a distant centre, might be so
retarded by the resistance of rocky masses as not to produce the required
amount of distui'bance. The evidence furnished by several most intelligent
and trustworthy persons leaves no doubt that on the day mentioned a very
slight shock was reaUy felt on the north side of the valley ; that the move-
ment seemed to come from the westward, and was attended by a slight
noise, which died gradually away towards the south-east.

    This somewhat disappointing result has led your Committee to add two
more cylinders of increased delicacy to each set, and to use every effort to
obtain suitable sites for other sets more to the west and north, and also
further down the valley, as near Dunira, the conjectured focus, and that
fixed on by Mr. Milne-Homo in the former inquiry, in Glen Lednoch near
the edge of the eruptive granite tract, whence the late disturbance seems
to have proceeded; and, if possible, also at Ardoch, Dunblane, and Bi-idge
of AUan, at all of which the shocks of 1873 were so severely felt. The
expense would be inconsiderable ; the difficulty to be encountered is the
procuring of a suitable and safe site and a competent observer. Your Com-
mittee earnestly hope that these obstacles will be overcome in the course of

the succeeding year.

--Report on the Present State of our Knowledge of the Crustacea.

   Part II. On the Homologies of the Dermal Skeleton {continued). By

   C. Spencb BatEj F.R.S. 6fc.

                                                          [Plates II., III.]

As in the first part of this lleport the carapace or dorsal surface of the
Crustacea was considered, it is now intended to examine the plastron or
ventral surface, aud so complete our inquiry into the form and structure of
the dermal skeleton, previous to a consideration of the internal viscera and

development of the animals of the various forms in the class.
   The head, or ccphalon, is more clearly defined in Edriophthalmous Crustacea

than in any other order ; but even here the somites posterior to the mandi-
bular ring have the dorsal surface wanting ; but a clearly defined character
distinctly separates them from the somites that pertain to the succeeding
seven, which constitute the ijereion.

   This condition is less complete in Squilla (which M. Milne-Edwards has
selected as being " of aU Crustacea that in -which the 21 segments of the body
are the most distinct "), where the posterior somites of the cephalon as well
as the anterior two of the pcrcion are only represented by their ventral sur-

faces.

   This apparent incompleteness of structure, which is due rather to an
economy of material, has led carcinologists to consider generally that the
cephalon and pereion should be treated anatomically as one portion of the
animal imder the general name of cephalothorax.

   Thus Dana, in writing on the " Classification of Crustacea," in his ' Report
on Crustacea of the United- States Exploring Expedition under Capt. Chas.
Wilkes, U.8.iSr.,' p. 1397, says, " In these highest species, nine segments and
nine pairs of appendages out of the fourteen cephalothoracic belong to the
senses and mouth, and only five pairs are for locomotion."

    This he has taken from the Brachyural or Macrural decapod, as being the

highest tj'pes of the order; but if we are to report our experiences and define

the names and conditions of things according as they are represented in a
single type or groiip, every student of any special form wlU draw his own
conclusions from that which he has alone closely considered, and the study of
Crustacea as a class in the animal kingdom must be retarded, if not mis-

represented.

    In studying scientifically the Crustacea as a whole, it will be found not
only more correct but more convenient to describe and name the several
parts of the animal by their homologous certainty rather than by their adapta-
tion to fulfil different functions which demand a variation of form with the
greater or less importance of their requirements.

   The seven somites that form the cephalon are most closely associated, and
diificult to be separated from those that follow, in the Brachyural type. This
circumstance appears to be largely due to the powerful character of the man-
dibular appendages. The great strength of these organs requires such an
internal development of parts that they appear to preclude the posterior
somites from the power of growth ; consequently they become merely sufiicient
to siipport appendages of a supplementary character.

    This is very apparent in the Macrural order. In Palinurus the mandibles
are so broad and large that their removal is almost a complete decapitation.
It is therefore a structural necessity that tho posterior two somites of the
cephalon -should be supported by those to which they are most closely
--76 REPORT 1876.

approximate; consequently they are frequently found fused with the anterior

somites of the i^ereion.

   Yet in this very genus, in a young state, we have the most complete evidence

of the limits that define the cephalon from the percion, and this again from

the pleon.

   In the larva of Pcduuims, as well as in the animal known as Fhijlhsoma,
which is now generally accepted as being the young of Pcdimirus after some

weeks' growth, the cephalon is seen to coincide with the limits of the cara^
pace and terminates anteriorly to the seven somites of the pereion. It there-
fore appears tliat it is desirable to identify these first seven somites as belong-
ing to the head or cephalon and that only.

    The pereion, or thorax, is also composed of seven somites or segments; and
this number is never departed from, even in the most depauperized condition
of the animal. These several somites Prof. Milne-Edwards, in his " Obser-

vations sur Ic Squelette tegumentaire des Cnistaces dccapodes, et sur la

--Morphologic dc ccs animaux," Ann. des Sciences Nat. p. 268, 1854, says :

" In order to determine easily each of these anatomical elements of the integu-

mentary skeleton, it is desirable to define them by a name ; and I shall call
 them jyi'otosomite, deutosomite, mesosomiie, or iritosomite, tetartosomite, pemp-
 tosomite, Jiectosomite, and hehdosomite, following the order which they occupy

from before to behind."
    In the lower types they form, as in the Amphipoda, separate and distinct

segments ; but in the higher groups, as we see the dorsal surface of the somites

 of the cephalon developed and produced posteriorly so as to cover and protect

 the upper part of the pereion, so we find the somites of this latter division

 coalesce ventrally more or less perfectly until in the Macrura and Brachyura
 they reach the highest degree of consolidation and are much more dense and
 strong than is the structure of the carapace.

     This condition is gradually seen to be approached through different stages

 from the Edriophthalmia upwards. In the genus SqiuUa (which has many

 analogies with the sessile- eyed Crustacea, and appears like an enormous
 stalk-eyed Amphipod) three or four of the posterior somites are exposed
 beyond the carapace and have the dorsal arc complete and separately perfect.

 In the Diastylida) we see the same : and ultimately in the genus Paguriis,
 among the Anomurous Crustacea, there is but a single somite that is not

 embraced within the limits of the carapace, and that is reduced to a very

 slender ring.
      AVith the deterioration of tlie dorsal arc of each somite of the pereion the ven-

 tral arc increases in density and coalesces the more perfectly with its neighbours.

 This appears much to depend upon the habits and character of the animal.

 If it be one whose habits arc perambulatory, as in Pcdinwus, the somites
  are strongly fused together into a strong broad sternum ; whereas in such
 animals as Palcemon and Homarus the sternum is less strongly developed,
 and apparently of a more feeble character.

     This depreciation of the sternum gradually goes on as we approximate the

  short-tailed orders, and arises from the absorption of the first joint or coxa
  of the leg into the general system of the animal.

     In Palinurus the sternum (PI. II. fig. 1), corresponding to the posterior
 five somites, is very broad, and the legs are very widely separated from those
  on the opposite side ; in Homarus, Neplirops, and Astacus {V\. II. fig. 2) they
  approximate each other so nearly that the sternum consists of a small cal-
 careous longitudinal cord, to which the apodema are attached and receive

  their support.

ON OUR PRESENT KNOWXEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  T7

   Tn the Anomura, of which wo may take Litliodes (PI, II. fig. 3) as an

example, the coxaj of the legs are so closely compressed together laterally

that, without coalescing or being fused together, thoy are apparently united,

while the inferior part of each coxa is completely fused with its neighbour

for about half its extent.

   This is carried still farther in the true Brachyura (PI. II. fig. 4), where

the first joints of the legs are all consolidated into a tolerably perfect
mass of calcareous structure, and resemble the nature and character of a
sternum.

   The ventral plastron, therefore, is formed of the first joint of the leg, and
the inferior arc of these seven somites is wanting iu the true Brachyura in

the adult stage, the inferior surface of the legs fulfilling the duty of the sternal

plate. As I have already observed, this state can be traced gradually from the
Macrura to the Brachyura ; and it may also be observed gradually to assume
this condition by following the development of the young, in which the coxal
joints may be distinguished separate and individually present, and gradually
coalescing as the animal increases in dimensions with age. I am aware that

this assertion is not in accordance with the teachings of previous carcinolo-

gical anatomists ; but it is one that can be proved to demonstration.
    Milne-Edwards, " Observations sur le Squelette tegumentaire des Crus-

tacea de'capodes," Ann. des Sc. Nat. p. 269, 1854, says, " These rings exhibit
all the tergal pieces, and are closed above by a carapace, except among a small

Wenumber of Anomura, as the Cenobitts, where the seventh ring is complete.

can distinguish always a ventral arc, constituted normally by two sternal and
two episterual pieces, and a dorsal arc, represented upon the sides of the epi-
meral pieces of the sclerodermic prolongations extending between the ven-
tral and dorsal arcs of each ring, so as to enclose between them each side of
the body, and to circumscribe before and behind the articular cavities destined

for the insertion of the corresponding members. When the rings are free, each

of these arcs' extremities I shall call artJirodkds, for the sake of bein" dis-

tinct ; but when the zones are soldered together it is diff'erent. The anterior

arthrodial of each thoracic ring is united to the posterior arthrodial of the
preceding zone, and is more or less completely united with it, so that the
interarticular space situated between two such legs, instead of presenting
two sclerodermic rings, lodges only a single artlirodial prolongation, which

becomes common to the two approximating frames, so that it appears to
depend more especially upon the last of the two rings so united. To simplify

the description, I shall consider these complex arthrodials as if they were
formed only by their most important parts, and shall neglect consequently

their anterior plate ; but it should be observed that we can nearly always
recognize its existence. There is also an interannular symphysis which

results from the formation of an interior fold of the sclerodermic lamella, a
fold the two plates intimately sustain between them. These processes must
be looked upon as if they were produced by the simple lamella of the posterior
border of one of the segments so imited bj^ symphysis.

    " It is always in the anterior portion of the thorax of the decapods that
consolidation of the integumentary skeleton is carried to the furthest limit by
 the soldering or fusion of the anatomical elements."

   Now what I contend is, that the structure of the somite has, as a part of

the dermal skeleton, ventraUy disappeared in the Brachj-ura, and its place
has been taken by the dermal tissues of the first joint of the several legs of
the pereion, and the apodema is formed in the various families of Crustacea
out of parts that are homologically distinct.
--78 REPORT 1876.

   In the Anomura, of which TAtliodes may form the best example, the coxaj
may best be dissected out ; and it does not require any very extreme care to

separate the frame of one appendage from those by which it is compressed
both anteriorly and posteriorly, bj' which compression the joint partakes of

a quadrilateral form. The plates are in many places reduced to an extreme

tenuity, and practically fulfil the office of a ^^single wall, although in reality
they are produced by two lamellae closely compressed but not united. The

i7iferior or ventral wall, that forms the sternum, is very much more strong,

and extends until it meets the corresponding plate upon the opposite side.
In Lithodes this simple condition extends from the anterior to the posterior

extremity of the percion.

   In the Brachyura, of which we may take Cancer as the type, the walls of

the coxal joint form the floor of the percion from the anterior extremity to
the fourth or tetartosomite, from which posteriorly an upright wall in the
median line separates the right side from the left, and encloses the muscles

of the four posterior pereiopoda within as many corresponding chambers,

forming a strong arch that supports the internal viscera and precludes their
sinking into the ventral cavity.

   If, as I contend, this condition of the structure may be demonstrated

beyond doubt, it follows that the episternal pieces lose their homological

signification, as defined by Prof. Milne-Edwards, in the same way as the

epimera of the dorsal arc.
   The episternal plates are parts of the first or coxal joint of the legs pro-

duced as plates, valuable as supporting tlie articulations of the next succeed-
ing joint with the first. It is interesting to observe that these so-called
episternal plates can be traced back to large spinal processes in the young
animal, and to less important processes in the pupal or thii'd stage in the
process of the development, where they can be distinctly seen as parts of the
coxee of the appendages attached to the poreion (fig. 7).

   This appears to be the anatomical condition in the Brachyura, and also
in some of the Anomural groups.

   But in the Macrural tjpe the ventral surface of the pereion is formed of
the lower arc of the several somites which belong to this division of the ani-
mal. Some slight variations of form and apj^earance exist in separate genera.
In Palinurus the anterior part of the sternvim is narrow and longitudinally
longer than broad, while the posterior part gradually increases in width
from the anterior to the posterior extremity. Each somite is completely
fused with those with which it is in contact at the centre, while deep lines
of fissure define their separation on each side, the posterior process of which
somites corresponds analogically with the so-called episternal plates in the
Brachyura, but homologically they are distinct, being, in this form, parts of
the true somite, and not a portion of the coxa of the leg incorporated with it
(PL II. fig. 1).

   In the genus Astacits the sternal plates are all narrow, being scarcely
broader posteriorly than they are anteriorly, while in the genus Ilomanis the
sternal plates are still more narrow and less important. This appears to be the
general characteristic of the ventral plates in Nephrops, Palamon, Crangon,
&c., but more delicately and feebly constructed, so far as the external condi-
tions ; but in the lower forms of Crustacea, such as the Amphipoda and the
I^opoda, the sternal plates are broader than they are long, and consequently
the several pairs of appendages are widely separated from each other, cor-
respondingly so throughout the entire length of the pereion.

   The internal structure in the Podophthalmous types is more complex than
the same parts in the lower or sessile-eyed forms.
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  79

   In Astacus, where the structure is perhaps more distinct, the margins of
the approximating somites are seen to be compressed together, the anterior
margin of one with the posterior of the next, and to thin out and ultimately
combine together into a thin wall or plate of partition, separating the several
sets of muscles connected with appendages belonging to one somite from
those belonging to adjoining ones. Independently of being walls of separa-
tion thcj are points of attachment on which some of the muscles are securely
fixed. Not only do they exist near the lateral margin, but continue in-
wards and extend forwards until they reach the corresponding processes on
the opposite side of the percion, and also anteriorly until they unite with a
similar system of osseous plates in the adjoining somite. Each plate appears

to form a basis on which a strong muscle may take root on cither side, thus

forming a fulcrum for muscular power and a means of separating one set of
muscles from another. In Palinurus these plates, when they approximate
the median line, turn over and lie horizontally with the longitudinal axis of the
animal. These plates thus displayed form a perforated floor on which the
larger and more important internal viscera rest. This osseous system con-
tinues from the postmandibular somite persistently to the penultimate somite
of the percion, where it is united with the floor of the pereion by a central
and lateral point of contact.

    The anterior margins of the two halves of the first somite of the pereion
meet together in the centre and form an oblique and prominent bridge that

supports the posterior portion of the stomachic viscera, while the internal

processes of the apodema, as tkey are termed by M. Milne -Edwards, that spring
from the posterior two somites of the cephalon, are closely attached to, and
at their extremities are perfectly ossified with, the lateral and central parts
of the apodema of the anterior somite of the pereion, a point of union that the
structure of the animal requires to be of considerable strength, as the enor-
mous processes of the internal movable mandibular plates occupy so large a space
that their points of attachment necessitate a structure of greater resistance
and strength than the impoverished character and condition of the two
posterior somites of the cephalon are capable of securing to them, without
the additional support which they receive from a union of a more or less
perfect character with the anterior somite of the pereion.

    The apodema that support the internal viscera are perforated by a series
of foramina that, whUe they correspond in form on each side of the central
line, yet diff'er in size and shape according to the relative proportions of the
organism that are connected with them. The dimensions of the foramina,
through which the muscles move the large and more important appendages, are
larger and more conspicuous than they that relate to those that move the
less efficient and smaller organs of the body. Thus we find that, generally,
the largest and most conspicuous foramina correspond with the third somite
of the pereion in Palinurus, Astacus, &c., whereas in those genera where the
great prehensile hand is produced by the increased growth and proportions of
any other pair of appendages, the foramina in the apodemal plate correspond
with the increase of their dimensions.

    In the Anomura, of which we will take Liiliodes as the type, the internal

and apodemal plates do not project so as to reach the corresponding pro-
cesses on the opposite side. There are only six somites fused together on the
ventral surface, or, I should rather say, contributing to the formation of the

sternal plastron ; the seventh somite exists as a separate and distinct ring,
both dorsally and ventraUy free from ossified union with the anterior somites
of the pereion.
 80 REPORT--1876.

     In this genus the sternal plate, as an anatomical part of the animal, is
 wanting, or represented only in a theoretical character by the median line

  of fusion.

     The coxae are existent without fusion with each other for some extent,
 visible on the ventral surface before their close contact reaches ossification so
 perfect that their line of union is represented by marks of depression only
 on the external surface, and corresponding crests or ridges on the internal
 surface. Dorsally this appears to be similarly repeated, and the lines of con-
 tact are imperfect in their fusion until the plates have thinned out into a
 membrane. Laterally the walls of the coxoe of the several pairs of appen-
 dages are so closely compressed that their lines of union are with difficulty
 determined not to be fused together. That they exist for some distance as

 thin plates in close contact is certain ; but they ultimately reach a point

 where the distinction is lost in perfect ossification. The internal plates ap-
 proach the corresponding ones on the opposite side in the first two somites
 only, which form a bridge that supports the posterior extremity of the stomachic
 region ; behind this the ventral surface rapidly widens, but the apodema or

 internal plates abruptly terminate, leaving a large expansion for the internal

 viscera to occupy.

     In the Brachyura the central fusion of the sternal plates is still more perfect,
 and the ventral portion of the somites appears to be covered entirely ; this
 exists in a vertical plate that appears to be formed by being compressed
 between the coxee of the corresponding pairs of appendages, the external

 surface of which may be traced to a sinus (PI. II. fig. Grt) that opens in the
 median line between the third and fourth somites. The segments of the
 pereion in this order of Crustacea, as may be seen in the genus Cancer,

 are very closely compressed, and apparently overlap each other dorsally,
 while ventrally the several appendages, from their proportionate dimensions,
preclude the possibility of too close a contact. The consequence is that the
 general arrangement of the entire muscular system that moves the appen-
 dages or the pereion, together with the osseous structure that supports them,
 is arranged in a circular fonn, the superior or extensor muscles forming the
upper or dorsal arc, and the inferior or flexor muscles forming the lower or
ventral arc. The plate, therefore, that is produced internally in the median line
is in continuation with the anterior portion of the ventral floor of the pere-
ion, and is the homologue of the sternal plate. This tendency of the muscles

to form round a common osseoiis centre appears to give a similar relation of
the several somites to one another. Thus we find that the apodema narrows

the dorsal extremity corresponding to each somite to such a degree that a
deep notch or fold takes place over the fourth pair of appendages, at which
point the curvature is greatest (fig. 5). It is this circular portion of the
muscles that facilitates that peculiar arrangement by which the posterior
two pairs of legs in Dromia, Boripe, &c. appear to be attached to the dorsal

surface of the animal, which enables them to adhere to floating pieces of
wood or weed, or seci:rely attach themselves to univalve shells by means of

these appendages.

   The pleon, or that portion of the animal to which the appendages are
attached which, in their most perfect condition, are adapted for swimming,
undergoes a great variety of forms. It is perhaps most perfectly developed,
in accordance with the value and usefulness of its parts, in the Macrurous

division of Crustacea.

   In the Edriophthalmia it is perhaps more simple in character ; but it is in
the Anisopoda, or that intermediate stage that unites the Isopoda and the
       ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.                         81

 Amphipoda, that we are enabled to determine the true homologlcal relation

  of one part to the other.

     In all Crustacea above the Entomostracous forms the several somites are
 distinguished by a dorsal and a ventral arc. The dorsal is invariably a hard,
 strong, and osseous plate. The ventral arc is mostly represented by an osseous
 band that reaches across the animal, aud is united anteriorly and posteriorly
 to the contiguous somites by large and flexible membranous tissues. The
 dorsal arc is wide, and dips under the adjoining one anteriorly in all except
 the second somite in the Macrura, which overrides the plates of the adjoin- ·
 ing somites both anteriorly and posteriorly. This arrangement does not
 exist in the Edriophthalmia, because, there being no dorsal carapace pro-
 tecting the pereion, all the somites have a separate and distinct dorsal arc.
 The consequence is that each somite posteriori}'- overlaps the anterior margin
 of the next succeeding ring, except the first or anterior somite of the pereion,
 which overlaps anteriorly the posterior margin of the cephalon and posteriorly
 the anterior margin of the second somite of the pereion. In each of these

 orders of Crustacea we find that the greatest power of flexion is given

 to the animal at these points.

     In all the distinguishable somites of the Edriophthalmia, from one extre-
 mity of the auimal to the other, each separate one is observed to support
 laterally a large plate. These, in the pereion, are firmly attached to their
 respective somites, but not ossified to them ; in the pleon they are so united
 by ossific matter that one part is not capable of being separated anatomically
 or distinguished in structure from the other. It is these parts in this
 particular division of Crustacea that originated the idea of the theory of the
 Crustacean somite as enunciated in 1830 by Prof. Milne-Edwards. The
 fact that the supposed side-plates, or epimera, were merely the first joint of
 the normal legs or appendages has been satisfactorily demonstrated in the
 Edriophthalmia, as far as relates to the somites of the pereion ; but hitherto
 the I'elation of the side-plates of the pleon to the normal condition of the
 mobile appendages had not been demonstrated until the structure of the
-dermal anatomy of the genus A23seHdes had been made out* : that " one inter-

esting and, as far as we know, unique feature in these Crustacea yet remains
to be noticed. The segments of the pleon have the lateral walls (long known
as the epimera of Milne-Edwards, called also the pleura by many authors)

existing as articulated appendages, demonstrating two important features in
 the homologies of these parts: 1st, that they are all really portions of the
 appendages, being the first joint or coxae of the pleopod . . . aud 2ud, that,
 since the peduncle consists of three joints, the second branch in the appen-
dages of the pleon, as in other parts, is shown to take place invariably at the
 extremity of the third joint." In the Macrura and higher Stomapods the
 coxal joint of the several appendages is united to the dorsal arc in a ver}'
perfect and complete state of ossification, with the exception of the first
somite, where there are no appendages, and the sixth, where the coxa is free
 and articulates, with small lateral motions, with the dorsal arc of the respec-
tive somite. The seventh somite {teIso7i) is reduced in character and altered in
foi-m ; it universally covers and holds the terminal exit of the alimentary
canal, the inferior arc of which is represented by a membranous tissue. In
the Amphipodous order of Crustacea the fifth and sixth somites carry their
 appendages with free coxa;, and the terminal somite exists only in the form
of a scale very liable to vary in shape, or separated into two of minute

dimensions. In the Isopoda the sixth somite only has the coxte free, and the
appendages attached to them bear no very distant analogy to the homologous
pair as they exist in the Macrura. In numerous genera of Isopods the
sixth somite is developed to a very large size, and either absorbs or displaces
the terminal somite or telsou altogether, which in some genera is repre-

sented by a notch or cavity only, while in many others it is produced to a

point or terminates in a smooth and even margin ; with the exception of
some of the Anisopocl genera, the telson probably is absent throughout the

order of Isopods.

    The form of the pleon in the Brachyura bears as close a resemblance to
that of the Isopoda belonging to the tribe Liberatka as that of the Macrura
resembles Parasitica in the same order.

    The coxse or side-pieces, as they have been very commonly supposed to be,
are, in the Brachyura, very densely ossified with the dorsal arc, and this to
such an extent in the male animals that it is very difficult to determine their
presence. In the female, where the lateral development assumes a greater
extent, the line of union is capable of being determined by a marked depress
sion that defines the limit of the somites and the altered position of the appen.-
 dao'es ; but that they are homologicallj' present in both sexes there can be no

reasonable cause of doubt. This, I think, may be generally depended on-^
that the more the coxa departs from the normal typo of the joint, as we see

 in the Macrurous Crustacea, and becomes associated with the dorsal arc of
 the theoretical somite, the more the character of the appendage becomes sim-
 plified or depreciated ; but, on the other hand, the more intimately it be-
 comes associated with the ventral arc, the more it becomes developed in its
 connexion with the requirements of the animal, and any variation of form is
 dependant on the value of its position and the habits and necessities of the

 creature. Thus we find that aU the appendages of the cephalon and pereion

 are associated with the ventral arc in the Brachyura and Macrura, but in
 the Edriophthalmia those of the pereion are associated with the dorsal arc
 whereas the ap])eudages of the pleon are, in all divisions of Crustacea, so
 intimately associated with the dorsal arc that in most cases the coxa is in-

 corporated with the somite, and generally the remainder of the appendages
 disappear or are reduced to merely a rudimentary condition, useful in some
 females for the attachment of ova ; while in the males they disappear more
  or less completely, or in the general conditions of Kfe become variated so as

  to fulfil special requirements or peculiar functions.

     Thus the 21 somites of which the typical Crustacean consists each sup-

 ports in its most simple condition a single pair of appendages ; and if we were

 to suppose every segment of the animal to be reduced to its most simple cha-

 racter, and the appendages attached to each segment reduced to the most
  simple form of articulated hmbs, and all of them uniform in size, the animal

  would bear a close analogy to a segmented annelid.

     This we must take as the archetype of a crustaceous animal, and assume

  that the appendages are attached to the spaces that exist between the dorsal

 and the ventral arcs of each somite. Thus when we observe any extreme
 variation of form, we must consider the earliest and most simple condition of

  the appendage in the archetype ; and it is not at variance with our idea of
  progression to assume that any great departure from the most simple type

 that appears to be common to the entire or a large portion of the subking-
 dom of Crustacea had its origin at an earlier period in the history of its

  evolution.

     The organs of vision arc common to all the Crustacea; and in those species
                                                                                   ;

that arc blind in their adult condition, the eyes are generally well developed

in the younger stages.
   The eyes are, independent of their value as organs of vision, of great im-

portance in the study of the natural arrangement of the various forms of
animals in the subkingdom. They vary in form and character from the
most incipient ophthalmic spot to the compound eye erected on pedestals
but whether single or compound, solitary or in pairs, their form and compo-
sition is generally so persistent with certain forms and characteristics of the
life and habits of the animals that the few exceptions to the general rule do
not preclude them from being au important and valuable means of arranging

. Crustacea.

This was first appreciated by Leach, in 1815, in his Classification of the two

great divisions of these animals. He arranged them under the two great

--heads of PoDOPnTHALiiiA and EDEiorHTHALMiA or those Crustacea that in

their adult stage have the eyes elevated on peduncles or footstalks, and those

which have them sessile or Avithout any footstalk. To this general observa-

tion the exceptions are very few. Among some genera that inhabit subter-

ranean passages and live in the dark, the footstalks are so reduced in size that

they can only be said to exist theoretically, inasmuch as we find them well

Weexhibited in their young and early stage.        must therefore assume that

they have depreciated from their normal condition through adverse circum-

stances. On the other hand, among the Edriophthalmia we have the genus

Tanais with its compound eyes elevated on their own pedestals, differing from

the pedunculated form only in being rigid and incapable of movement.        ;

In the Podophthalmia the eyes are implanted at the extremities of appen-

dages that are supported upon a separate and distinct somite.

In 1837 Prof. Milne-Edwards demonstrated this to be the case in the genus

Squilla ; in 185-1 he states, in his " Observations sur le Squelette tegumen-
taire des Crustaccs decapodes," Ann. des Sciences Nat. p. 254, which I have

since confirmed (fig. 7 ), that in the genus Palmunis (the Langouste) " I'anneau

ophthalmique est parfaitement distinct, et se pre'sente sous la forme d'une piece

sclerodermique impaire, courte et large, situec en avant du bord frontal de la

carapace, et au-dessus de I'anneau antcnnulaire. Les appendices ophthal-

miq'ues, ou tiges oculaires, naissent des deux extremites de ce segment, et se

composcnt chacun de deux articles : une piece que j'appeUerai hasophthahnite,

et une seconde, qui porte a son extremite la cornee transparente, et qii'on

peut nommer podophihalmite"

Milne-Edwards in the same manner shows how in several species of Pali-

nurus the antero-median portions of the carapace project more or less com-
pletely over the ophthalmic ring, and so {I. c. p. 255) " par consequent,

ouvert a ses deux extremites laterales pour le passage des tiges oculaires, et

I'espece de cadre ainsi constitue autour de la base de ces tiges forme la por-

tion fondamentalc de I'orbite ou trou orhitaire."

Thus the orbit in Crustacea is formed by the thii'd or second antennal

somite reaching over and coming into contact more or less perfectly with the

first antennal somite. The greater or less in degree the separation between

the second and third somite above the ophthalmic somite the more or less

complete is the orbit in Avhich the eye is protected. This varies in different

genera, and is very complete in the genus Cancer (PL II. fig. 9), where the

ophthalmic somite is enclosed entirely by the union without fusion of theantero-

dorsal projection of the posterior antennal somite with the anterior antennal

somite ; but, according to Mihie-Edwards, in the genus Palinunis this perfec-

tion of the orbit varies. In P. vulgaris (fig. 8) the ophthalmic somite is naked,

                                                                          g2
81 ·                                                                 REPOKT 1876.

in P. frontalis it is covered, and in P. verrecnuvii it is enclosed ; and Milne-
Edwards observes that many other Crustacea offer examples of these three

organic forms. For instance Pagunis ccenohites and Calianassa have the
ophthahnic somite exposed as in. Palinwus vulgaris; Honmrus, Crangon, Pa-

Icemon, Galathea, Lithodes, lianina, &c. have this somite covered as in

Palinur us frontalis; and Homola has the ophthalmic somite enclosed.

   In Astacus the ophthalmic somite is reduced to a minimum extent, and it

is only partially protected by the anterior projection of the rostrum of the

carapace.

   Milne-Edwards says that, independently of the somite, the ocular appen-
dages are formed of three " articles " or joints, a eoxophthalmite, a basoph-

thalmite, and a podophthalmite, but that ordinarily the eoxophthalmite is

rudimentary or obsolete.

In the genus Alplueus (fig. 10) and other fossorial marine forms the ocular

appendage is reduced to an extent that allows the carapace to cover it

entirely; but in the larval form the organ (fig. 11) is seen to be as well de-

veloped and as prominent as that of any aquatic species. It is in this way
we may assume that the sessile condition of the organ in the Edriophthalmia

(fig. 12) has been attained, first by the contractiou or redaction in extent of

the ocular appendage, so that the anterior wall of the carapace shall cover it,
and then by the more intimate connexion of the organs with the structure of

the parts that protect them, and ultimately with entire absorption of the

ocular appendage ; the eye receives its support from the walls of the cara]3ace

alone.

   Even here the organs are themselves still liable to depreciation ; thus
those that exist where light is absent (which inhabit decj) wells, subter-

ranean caves, and excavations in the depths of the ocean) first lose the

dark colour of the reflecting pigments, which is soon followed by a degene-

ration of the character and appearance of the lens. In Amjpelisca, an Am-

phipod that lives in muddj- bottoms, all the lenses but two have disappeared,

and the pigment has become red ; in the well-shrimp {Niphargus) the only

trace of an eye exists in some yellow-looking pigment; while in the Podo-
phthalmia we find that Polycheles (Heller), a jn-awn from the Adriatic closely

allied to (if not identical with) Didamia from the deep-sea dredging of the

' Challenger ' expedition, and another from the Mammoth Caves of America,

as well as Nephrons Stewarti (Wood-Mason) from Formosa, have the eyes
wanting as organs of vision, while they retain them as obsolete appendages.

   The second pair of appendages is the first pair of antenna?. These M.

Milne-Edwards has named (for the sake of convenience in distinguishing them
from the second pair) the antenmdes. Eut as this term is one, in itself,

that is suggestive of dimiuutiveness and inferiority, I think that it had better

be employed as little as possible. Generally speaking, this pair is smaller in

proportion  than  the   second                                       but usually it                                                                                                                                                                                       is  of  a  more  highly organized
                                                                  ;

structure, and diminishes in dimensions as it becomes important in its

functional properties.

The appendage consists, in its normal condition, of three joints, homo-

typical of the coxa, the basos, and ischium of the true legs in Crustacea.

These three joints support an extremity that is very liable to vary in form,

number of branches, and general appearance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                but one of  them  must  be re-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

garded as the primary branch, iuasmucli as it is invariably furnished with a

set of organs peculiar to it, and found on no other part of the animal.

These are slender, delicate, mcra1n-anous, thread-like processes, that are

liable to vary somewhat in form and size, but are all but universally present
ON OUR PRESENT/KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  65

in aquatic Cnistacca, and whicli, from their supposed connexion with the
sense of hearing, I have elsewhere denominated aural cilia. The secondary
branch is less important, and frequently divides into two or more rami.

Sometimes these flagelliform branches are reduced in size to a minimum

amount, and this generally corresponds with the highest character of tlie

--organ ; for it appears to be in inverse ratio the longer and more extensive

the character of the terminal ilagella, the less developed is the structural
condition of the organ of sense contained within the peduncle ; and, on the

other hand, the more developed the sensational organ, the feebler and less
numerous is the organism and less antenna-lilve is the general character
of the distal portions of the appendage. To this very constant condition in

the aquatic forms of Crustacea we have a variation in the terrestrial

species. In the genus Onisms and allied forms of Isopoda, as well as in
the littoral varieties of Amphipoda, such as Talitnis, Orchestia, &c., the first

pair of antennae are reduced to a minimum proportion consistent with their

presence, without any increased importance in the structural condition of the
peduncular joints, as far as I have been able to ascertain.

   In the highest types of Crustacea the coxal joint is considerably enlarged
{vide pi. i. fig. 8 h, lleport for 1875), and contains within it a complicated
chamber and highly developed organ of sense ; while in the Macrurous forms
a less complicated chamber exists, with an external opening into which

small grains of sand find their way : in others, as first shown by Professor
Huxley in a species of Stomapod, well-developed forms resembling otolithes
are present ; this Dana has observed, and I have been enabled to confirm in
a species of Anchistia from Australia (PI. II. figs. 13 & 14).

  In some genera, as Mysis among the Stomapoda, they vary in form

according to sexual distinction. The male animal has the two terminal
flagella feeble and slender, while a fasciculus of strong hook-formed hairs
are planted on the inner and lower angle of the most distal extremity of the
second joint of the peduncle, while a similar but less powerful group of spine-
like hairs are planted on a strongly projecting process on the inferior distal
extremity of the first joint (PI. II. fig. 15). There are other hairs implanted
on the lower margin of this joint of a very delicate ciliated character. The
peduncle of this antenna is very powerful, and there can be little doubt but
that it is useful as an organ of prehension, most probably employed in se-
curing the mate. These several facts are demonstrative evidence that the
first pair of antenna are connected with the acoustic properties.

   Of this I purpose treating, as well as discussing the observations made by
Dr. Hcsen in his researches (published in 1864) on the auditory organs of
the Decapod Crustacea, when I report on the internal structure of the animal.

    Contrary to a possible condition of all other appendages, the coxal joint
of the first pair of antennae is never absorbed into or fused with the sternal
portion or ventral arc of the somite to which it belongs.

   The third pair of appendages consists of the second pair of antennte.
These are often very large and powerful organs, frequently adapted as
weapons of offence and prehension. They consist of two divisions similar
to the first pair, that is, a peduncular and flagelliform part. Of these the

peduncular consists of five joints, the flagelliform extremity of a strong,
solitary, multiarticulate rod in its most normal condition ; but it very fre-

quently varies in form, but never increases in the number of its branches.
  · In the Macrura generally the flageUum is produced, on an average, to

about the length of the animal, and is mostly multiarticulate in its character,
the small articuli varying in ntimber and length. .Sometimes, as in Scyllarus
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

(fig. 16), it consists of a single disk -like plate. But the greatest tendency to
variation in form exists in the Amphipod and Isopod Crustacea. In some
of these it reaches to a very considerable length and is multiarticulate, hut
in others it is reduced sometimes in length, sometimes in form. In Talitrus
it is reduced without alteration of character to a very small size ; so it is in
Hyperia ; but while in the former it stands on a long and powerful peduncle,
in the latter the peduncle is short and feeble. In Ohehira the flagellum is
broad, fiat, and uniarticulate, and fringed with a dense mass of soft hairs.
In Podocerus and a few closely allied genera the flagellum is formed of one
or two large articuli or joints, and the hairs are reduced in number but
increased in strength, and become hook-like spines. In Coroj)Mimi the
whole antenna bears a near resemblance to a true walking-appendage, and
is no doubt used to assist in progression, as is mostly the case with Crus-

tacea that inhabit tubes and hollows of their own excavation or building.
    The peduncle of this antenna is invariably formed of five joints. These

are :--

    The first, for which Professor Milne-Edwards has suggested, in the memoir
quoted, the name of coxocerite. This contains within it an organ of sense
which Milne-Edwards believes to be connected with that of hearing
but I think there will be little difficulty, when reporting on the internal
anatomy, in showing that it is connected with the olfactory sense. In
the Amphipoda and Isopoda, with but few exceptions, such as Talitrus,
OrcJiesiia, &c., the first joint is free ; but so it is in many of the Macrurous
forms, such as Astacus, Homarus, &c. But in Palinurus it is strongly built
into and fused with the ventral arc of the fourth or next approximating
somite. These parts are stOl more closely associated in the Brachyurous
form, so that it is difficult to determine where the antennae end and the
region named by Latreille the epistome commences.

    The second joint, named by Milne-Edwards the hasocerite, is generally
short and supports at its extremity a movable squamiform appendage, to
which the same carcinologist has given the name of sccqJiocerite. This
apx^endage is coiastant in all Macrurous forms of Crustacea. It appears to

be .wanting in the genus Palimirus only ; but even here it is represented, as
I had the opportunity of showing, in the Eeport on " The Marine Fauna of
Devon and Cornwall," by a figure of it incorporated in the integument of the
succeeding joint, as if it were absorbed by pressure against it.

    This appendage (scaphocerite) does not exist in any of the forms higher or
lower than the Macrura, except Pontki (PI. II. fig. 18) in the Entomostracous
forms, and that peculiarly interesting little Isopod A2')seudes, in which genus

we find a small squamiform plate resembling and probably homologous with it.
   The third joint the above author has named the ischiocerite, and the tAVo

following the mesocerite and the carpocerite, while the multiarticulate
fiagellum, which corresponds "to the penultimate joint of the thoracic
member," he calls the procerite. It is rather a curious oversight that, while
Milne-Edwards has been most particular in identifying the several parts of
the second antennge by an especial name, he has omitted to give any to those
of the first pair of antennae, the three joints of the peduncle of which are
homotypical of the coxocerite, the basocerite, and the ischiocerite of the
second pair of antennae; but the flagellum, instead of being homotypical of
the procerite, represents the mesocerite and the successive articulations.

% In the Macrura generally the joints of the peduncle are distinctly separated

from one another ; but in some of the higher forms, such as Astaciis, Homarus,
and Palinurus, they exhibit a tendency to crowd and coalesce with each other.
ON OUK PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  37

 that is increased in the Anomura, and carried to such a degree in tlie
 Erachyura, that in some, as in Meiiethceus, Leptopodus, Maia, &c., the first
 two or three articulations arc not to be distinguished from the surrounding

 structure except bj- the position of the olfactory opening.

     In the Cancerida3 all the joints of the peduncle (PI. II. fig. 17) are fused

 together and are so closely implanted in the structure of the facial portion of
 the two first somites that they assist m.ore or less perfectly in forming the
 walls of the ocular orbit, the several variations of which are made use of by
 Alphonse Milne-Edwards as a means of assisting him to distinguish the several
 genera of the Cancerides from each other, and which, from theii- easily acces-
 sible position, might be found a convenient aid in assisting to determine
 genera among fossil forms.

    Among the Amphipoda all the several articulations are distinct from one

 another and from the body of the animal, and the olfactory organ is carried
 in a long tooth-like process that is open at the extremity. This arrangement
 is not so distinct in the Isopoda and the terrestrial Amphipoda. It also dis-
appears in certain abnormal forms of aberrant and parasitic Isopoda.

    The next succeeding, or fourth pair of appendages is among the most con-
 stant in the subkingdom. Within certain limits the mandibles vary with every
genus, and would form when detached a very certain means of generic diag-
nosis. In the most simple condition, where they approximate in form to that

 of the peduncular portion of the second pair of antennas, they exist in Nehalia
(PL III. fig. 19). But, as stated by Milne-Edwards (" Squelette tegumentaire
des Crustace's de'capodes," p. 256, Ann. des Sc. Nat. 1854), the mandibles are
not appendages simply applied against the mouth, but occupy of themselves
a special cavity, flanking on either side the entrance to the alimentary canal,

which, when the two are brought into juxtaposition in the median line, they
generally close. The mandible in Nehalia (PI. III. fig. 19) is formed of a long

osseous process that projects internally, and is secured by muscular attachments

to the internal dorsal surface of the carapace ; a large obtuse-pointed process

is projected inwards across the mouth, and antagonizes with a corresponding
process on the one opposite. This process is very liable to vary in form in
different genera. Beyond this process, at the root of it, springs a cylindrical
osseous continuation, at the apex of which are articulated two equally long
and important joints. These two joints are homologically the same that form
the small appendicular appendage attached to the mandible of all Crustacea
(PI. III. fig. 21 ) so persistently that their absence is a fact to be recorded in the
structure of special genera, such as Talitrus and Orchestia among the Amphi-
poda. In a scientific point of view, this appendage must be part of the
primary portion of the theoretical limb. This idea also receives confirmation

in the form of the mandibles of the genus Pontia of Milne-Edwards, where may

be observed a secondary ramus attached to the extremity of the first joint of

the appendicular branch (PL III. fig. 20).
   This appendage M. Mdne-Edwards, in the nomenclature that he has

given, proposes to name the protognutli ; but the first joint, or true mandi-

bular portion, he calls the proto-coxor/nathite, and the second joint the proto-
lasognathite, and the other joints in succession after the names of the
respective joints in the ideal appendage which they homologically re-
present. While wishing to give all honour to that distinguished carcino-
logist for the care and exactitude in determining the several parts of the
structure of a crustacean by means of a distinct nomenclature, it is with

regret that I am compelled to admit that they would be more practically

useful, and consequeutly more generally adopted, if the terms were less
                --

lengthy, and -with a less redundancy of expression, I shall therefore in this
report, as far as possible, adopt the terms of definition proposed by Milne-
Edwards, but omit generally the appendicular term so constantly repeated
by him. Thus the terms coxa, basos, ischium, mesos, carpus, propodos, and

dactylos -will be sufficient for -whatever appendage I may be -writing about,
without repeating the name of the appendage, yvhether gnaihite, podite, cerite,

or other, after that of each individual joint.

    But it is only just that Professor Milne-Edwards's reasons for adopting
these terms should be reported in his own words. Writing of the appendages
of the mouth, he says :

    " Depuis les beaux travaux do Savigny sur la bouche dcs animaux arti-.
cule's, on e'accorde gcnc'ralemcnt a considerer tons ces organes comme etant
des homologues des pattes, mais on les distingue presque toujours entre eux
sous les noms particuliers de mandibules, machoircs proprement dites et
machoires auxiliaires ou pattes-machoires ; ces designations spe'ciales sont

·quelquefois utiles ; mais, dans la plupart des cas, il est preferable de con-

siderer tons ces appendices masticateurs comme des membres d'un seul et
raeme groupe orgauique, de leur donner un nom commun, et de specialiser
ce nom par radjonction d'une racine adjective ; on pourrait de la sorte les
nppeler protognathe, deutognathe, etc. et faire entrer le mot gnathitc, comme
racine constant, dans la composition dcs noms applique's a chacun des articles,

ou elements sclerodermiques, dont ils sont formes. Ces gnathites seraient
diffe'rencics a I'aide d'un certain nombre de racines adjectives indiquant leur
position dans le membrc, et lorsque dans les descriptions zoologiques on

aurait a en parler, on pourrait se borner a ajouter aux noms compose's, qui
appartiendraient en commun h tons les termes de chaque serie des pieces
liomologues, un uumcro d'ordre pour indiquer leur position dans cette scrie

organique, c'est-a-dire les appendices auxquels ils appartiennent. Ainsi je
proposcrai d'appeler coxognatMte, hasignatkite, mesognathite, etc. les articles
(jui, dans la serie dcs appendices maxillaires correspondent au co.vite, au hasite,
etc. dans les autres membres, et d'appeler premier coxognatliite la piece de
cet ordre qui appartient au protognathite, deuxieme co.vognathite celle qui
appartient au deutognaihite, etc. Ce systcme de nomenclature est a la fois si

bref, si commode et si eminemment significatif, que je demande aux carci-
uologistes la permission d'en faire usage uon seulement dans les considerations

morphologiques dont je m'occupe ici, mais aussi dans les travaux taxolo-

--giques que je me propose de publier proehainement."- " Squelette iegummtaire

des Crustaces decapodes" Ann. Sc. Nat. 1S54, p. 267.
   The mandible or protognathe is sometimes very large, and at others reduced

to a rudimentary condition. In Pcdinurus it occupies on each side one half
of the breadth of the animal, and to remove the two mandibles is almost to
decapitate the animal. In some of the parasitic forms it is reduced to a
rudimentary condition. In the female of Anceus {Pranisa) it, with other
appendages, coalesces to form a probing or lancing instrument that projects
like a proboscis beyond the head ; while in the male of the same genus the
niandibles are situated on the anterior margin of the head, and stand pro-
jecting like a pair of rude irregular antennae. Eut in this animal the mouth
is closed, or at most represented by a microscopic aperture, as it, in this
stage, exists without eating.

    In most forms of Crustacea the space that exists between the anterior
margin of the protognathe or mandible and the posterior margin of the
epistome is occupied by a fold of the membranous tissue that encloses the
oral cavity. This fold is frequently ossified and projected into a strong
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  89

labium or movable Kp. It is very conspicuous in young animals, and fre-
(jucntly iu adult forms, particularly among the Amphipoda. It is represented
by two small osseous disks in Palimtrus, and a single small triangular plate
in Cancer, Corresponding with this labium posteriorly is another that

protects the opening between the mandibles in this direction. This is also
supported frequently by osseous plates ; bat this organ is not constantly
developed beyond a limited extent, except in a fe^v instances. In Pallnurus
it consists of a central osseous plate, having a suture through the median
line ; from this base it projects in two long membranous sacs, supported on
the outer or posterior surface by one or two osseous plates (PI. III. fig. 22).
It is this organ, it appears to me, that represents and is homologous with the
lip-plate or metastoma in Eurypterus, Pteri/gotus, &c., that has been so fully
described by Huxley, Woodward, and Salter.

   The fifth or next succeeding pair of appendages is that which Prof. Milne-
Edwards has called the deutognathe. It is what has been known in popular
carcinology as the first pair of foot-jaws, and first maxilla or siagnopoda in
the ' History of the British Sessile-eyed Crustacea,' the latter name being sug-
gested by Prof. Westwood " as the Greek equivalent for the Latin name of
the five pairs of appendages succeeding the mandibles, which were collectively

teTxaed pattes-mdcJwires by Cuvicr, Savigny," &c.

   The deutognathe in all known form^ of Crustacea exists in the adidt stage

in an embryonic condition ; it is small in size, feeble in power, and consists, in
different genera and families, of a varying number of thin squamiform i:)lates.
Each joint of the typical limb, as far as present in the adult condition (PI. III.
fig. 23), offers no very exceptional distinction from the same iu the embry-

onic stage (fig. 24).

    The ti-itognatJw, or sixth pair of appendages, supports the idea of the adult
form bearing a close resemblance to that of the zoea or embryonic condition

stiU more decidedly (PI. III. figs. 25 & 26),

    The seventh pair of appendages, the teiarfognatJie of Mihie-Edwards's

nomenclature, is the first pair of muclioives aiuviliaires of Savigny, or the
anterior mdclwires or foot-jaws of most authors.

    These, in the adult Brachyura, are still more embryonic in appearance.
In Maia and Cancer they are very reduced in size and apparent importance

(PI. III. fig. 27) ; but in some less highly developed types, such as the Am-

 phipoda and Isopoda, where they are generally recognized under the name of
 maxUlipeds (PI. III. fig. 28), they assume a more important feature, and
 bear a not very distant resemblance to the typical form from which they
 are supposed to depart. In NihuUa they closely resemble the posteriorly

 succeediug pairs of limbs ; but in this genus the whole of these gradually
 degenerate to the embryonic condition as they recede from this point.

     In the larval or zoea stage of Crustacea they are wanting in the higher

 forms.

    These three pairs of limbs appear to me to offer an interesting and valuable

 example of the manner in which any great changes in the variation of the
 structure of an animal takes place. The crowding together so to speak of
 the three posterior somites of the ccphalon, so as to bring, as much as possible,

 the several pairs of appendages within the limits of the oral region, so crushes

 them in their position, that their usefulness as separate organs must be much

 impeded. It would therefore appear that the crowding of appendages
 together interferes with and arrests the progress of their development, while
 they are best suited to exist under the altered conditions where they are
 the least inconvenient. That they are of little or no importance iu the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

--90 REPORT 1876.

 economy of the animal can, I think, be demonstrated in the habits of theii-

--life a circumstance which, I think, can be shown in the slight variation of

 their structure in the adult stage from that of the larval form, to depart in
 the anterior members towards the mandibular form, and posteriorly to put
 on conditions most consonant with the usefulness of the succeeding appendage ;
 that is, while the anterior ones feebly approximate the mandibular form, the
 posterior have attached to them parts resembling immature branchial organs.

     These seven pairs of appendages are all that belong to the cephalon or head

 and it appears to me that, however closely any of those that succeed may be

 associated with them in functional purposes, they are homologically distinct,
 and, as members of separate portions of the body, they should be named
 and distinguished in a scientific nomenclature more in accordance with their
 homological relationship than with their functional power.

    The next pair of appendages is the first that belongs to the pereion or

 thorax in the Crustacean typo of animals. It is the eighth pair in posterior

 rotation, but is generally named by authors according to its relation to the
 mouth. It is the 2'>^^^^ptognatlie of Milue-Edwards's more recent nomenclatvu'e,
 the second pair of mdcJioires auxiliaires of Savigny, and the second pair of
 maxUlipeds or foot-jaws of most carcinologists. It is the fourth siagnojoodos
according to Professor Westwood's suggestion, and the fii'st pair of gnatlio-
poda of the 'History of British Sessile-eyed Crustacea,' according to the

 nomenclature of the author of this report.
    This multiplication of names for a single appendage, signifying, as they

severally do, various affinities, is by no means flattering to the students of
Crustacea; but, to a large extent, it occurs from the circumstance that while
one anatomist has contemplated the animal in the adult and higher concen-
trated forms, others have contemplated it in the more imperfect types. It
is therefore the object in this report to bring together these several and
various discrepancies, and demonstrate the relationship) of jiarts through
their various degrees of growth and change, and retain by one fixed name

the same part however it may vary in structure or functional conditions

through all stages of variation in Crustacean life.
· In Crustacea the eighth pair of appendages in the structure of the ani-
mal is the first pair that belongs to the body. In the Brachyura it
exists in the same type as is found in the zoea or larva form (fig. 29),
from which it varies only in the more robust character of some of the
joints of which it is constructed (PL III. fig. 30). In this state it varies in
form and degree only within a limited range, gradually becoming more pedi-

form in character as we examine it through the Macrura (PL III. fig. 31) in
the descending order until we reach SquUla (PL III. fig. 32), where we find

it developed as a large and important organ that gives a decided and distin-

guishing feature to the animal. Through this genus we are led to the
Eriophthalmia (PL III. fig. 33), among which we find that in the Amphipoda

it is formed on the same type as in SqiiiUa, but gradually approaching in its
general characteristics and appearance those of the succeeding pairs of legs,
until in the Isopoda it is in most families uniform with them.

   Thus we see that not only in their relation to the body of the animal, but

also in their most general appearance and affinities they are part of the
game system of appendages as those posterior to them, and that their relation
to those anterior arises from that crowding together of parts in the higher
types of Crustacea that forces an abnormal form as the result.

    This fiair of appendages, as being the first attached to the " pereion " or

body of the animal, may with consistency be called, as it reaUy is, the

first pair of pereiopoda. But throughout the higher Crustacean forms the
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  91

first two pairs of appendages are functionally utilized as attendants upon the
mouth]; and where this is not the case they are formed as organs of prehen-
sion, more especially among the male animals. This is exemplified even in
those species, as among the terrestrial Isopods, where the outward form is
less striking, but tlie whole appendage is strengthened for grasping piirposes.

    The next or ninth pair of appendages is almost if not universally formed
upon the same type as the preceding. There is a departvire in degree to bo
found, more pronounced in the Brachyura, in consequence of the appendages
crowding so much on one another. Thus, while those that experience most
the pressure of those that overlap them are precluded from attaining their

fully developed forms, the external ones, or they that overlap the preceding,

have, in order the more perfectly to fulfil their duties, extended their own

surfaces, so as more effectually to protect the oral cavity, as an operculum
covering the month.

    These two pairs are variated so constantly from the other appendages
of the percion that I think it will be foiind convenient in most cases to
designate them by distinguishing names. The licporter has, in the Eeport
on the Amphipoda in 1865 and elsewhere, called them gnathopoda, as feet
or appendages connected with the mouth ; and I see every reason whj' this
name should be adopted throughout the whole subkingdom, as one better
adapted, both functionally and homologically, than those proposed either by
Milne-Edwards's latest nomenclature, or the still less correct ones in popular

use of previous authors.
    In the larval form the second gnathopod is less advanced than the first,

but in the adult stage it is larger and more efficient. An exception to this

exists in Nehalia, where all the appendages of the pereion are developed
upon an immature or embryonic type. These gradually decrease in power
and form the more they recede posteriorly. All these appendages exhibit

the seven joints that are present in the formation of a single limb ; and in
those instances where there is a decrease in that number, the joint that is
wanting is lost at the extremity. This appears to be very general through
aU the Brachyural and Macrural divisions.

    In the higher forms both pairs of gnathopoda carry a secondary branch

as well as another that has generally been known as the " fiabelliform
appenage." For these Milne-Edwards has proposed the name of endognathe

for the primary or internal ramus, exognathe for the external or second

ramus, and epignatJie for that which is generally known as the " fiabelliform

appendage," and mesognathe for the fourth. But as the representatives or
homotypes of these same appendages occur in different grades of Crustacean
form, and whenever they do occur they bear the same relation to the limb
from which they spring, it would be better that they should consistently

be known by their homotypical character, rather than vary their name with

every succeeding appendage. Thus the fiabelliform appendage invariably
springs from the coxa or first joint, and is homotypical of the branchial
organs in other pairs of limbs ; another is invariably connected with
the hasos or second joint, and the third has its origin in the ischium or

third joint. One or all may be suppressed ; but whenever either the
one or the other is present it has its origin in its own peculiar joint,

and as such should be identified in any scientific nomenclature. I there-
fore suggest the names of coxecjjJii/sis, hasecphysis, and iscliiecpliysis for the

several parts*, as branches springing fi'om those joints, in whatever appen-

dage they may be found. Thus the secondary branch that exists attached to

the legs in Phyllosoma or the yoimg of Palinurus is an ischiecphysis ; in

   * The name of the joint being compounded with the word eKipvais, sprout or branch.

Mysis a very similar appendage is the 'basecptj-sis, while the bfanchise ard,

in all cases when present, the homologaics of the coxecphj-sis.
    The next five succeeding pairs of appendages are the true legs as they

exist in the typical forms of Crustacea, and it is from the general appearance

of them that the higher forms are known as Decapoda, or Ten-footed Crus-
tacea. In a scientific point of view the name is incorrect and misleading
for in manj^ of the Macrura and the Edi-ioplithalmia they are twelve or
fovirteen in number, while in the Anomura the departure of the last two

pairs of pcrciopoda from the tjpical form is as great as the two first in

many other forms ; consequently the name of Decapoda, as well as Dana's
name of TetracUcapoda, is both incorrect and homologically untrue. These

five pairs constitute the tenth to the fourteenth pairs of appendages ; but as
they are limbs attached to the pereion, I have elsewhere suggested that they

should bo known as pereiopoda. Milne-Edwards, in his nomenclature, has
not identified them with any distinguishing name ; he merely calls the anterior
pair, which is cheliform in many genera, by the name of bras (arms), and the

lestjyattes (feet), and it is remarkable that he should identify each one of the
seven joints that is present in its construction by a distinguishing term ; but

the entire member he defines by an imscientific but popular phrase that is
inconvenient, as it is found that the prehensile power is not confined to a
single pair, but, as in Asfacus and Homarus, is the property of other limbs,

while in some, as in Sc)/UarHS, it does not exist in any. Carrying this

observation into other forms, we find that in certain Amphipoda the great

chelate or arm-like organ exists in the fifth pair of pereiopoda, as in

Phronima. Thus we see that the power of being developed into a grasping

forceps or hand exists in each or all the pereiopoda in succession ; therefore

the term of arm, or bras, is inadmissible in a scientific nomenclature. I there-
fore propose to call these five pairs of appendages the pereiopoda, in accordance

with the terms used in the ' History of the British Sessile-ej-ed Crustacea.'
    They invariably consist of seven joints ; these are most distinguishable in

the Macrura and the lower forms. In the Report on the Sessile-eyed

Crustacea, 1855, the author clearly demonstrated the several joints respec-
tively in the Amphipoda. This required no effoi't on his part to interpret
in the Macrura, since in Homariis, Astaciis, and Pcdinurus the general

points are very distinguishable ; but as we examine higher in the scale of
animals, we find that in the Anomura the coxce of the several pairs of legs

are gradually becoming absorbed and becoming part of the ventral surface
of the body ; and this in the Brachyura is earned still further, inasmuch as

it is difficult to define how much of the structure is due to the legs and how
much to the body, and it is not improbable that the appendages have en-

croached upon and absorbed the generallj' more important structure.
   The coxa or first joint appears to be essential to the existence of the animal,

inasmuch as it is the seat of all the more important organs connected with
the vital existence. The auditory and olfactory senses are situated in the
cosas of the antenna?, and all the branchial appendages have their origin in
the coxfe of the pereiopoda, while the sexual organs, both male and female,
are implanted in the coxfc of the seventh and fifth pairs respectively. The
next two joints of the limbs may, and in some of the Stomapoda do, carry
appendages attached to them ; but none of the joints beyond the ischium are

ever so furnished.

   The anterior pair is the one most commonly developed in the higher forms
into large chelae or hands. It is the more general in the male than in the
female, and I have commonly observed that the female chela generally
corresponds more closely with the less-developed chela in males than with
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.                                                                                             93

the greater. Sometimes the male appendage is developed so monstroiisly

that they appear inconvenient and burdensome, and are occasionally so long

that they arc useless in an attempt to reach the mouth. Thus in Homarus

the animal feeds itself with the small posterior pair. In GeJassirmis no

ingenuity on the part of the animal would enable it to reach the mouth with

the extremities of the large chelate organ. In the process of feeding they

are useful only as holding food while the animal carries it to the mouth with

the smaller but more convenient organs. The chela is always formed by the

greater or less amountof development that is given to the inferior angle of the

distal extremity of the antepenultimate joint. This power of production ap-

pears to be dormant in every limb, since we see it occasionally exhibited in all.

Thus in Palinurus it is rudimentarily present in the posterior pair of pereio-

poda, and in the genus Pa<jnrus it is developed into a small but efficient organ,

by which the animal cleanses out and removes obstructive objects that may

have found their way into the branchial chamber, and so fulfils the same

duties as those performed by the fiahella attached to the gnathopoda, and

which are wanting in the Anomura.

The fact that the coxtc of all the legs attached to the pereion are in some

orders absorbed into the sternal plastron, while they are not so in others,

offers a ready and safe means by which pahieontologists may determine the

order to which a fossil Crustacean might belong by the evidence of a single

leg. Thus it will be seen invariably that seven distinct and free joints are

visible in the  Macrura, while  only six  are  free in  the Brachyura                                                                  whereas
                                                                                                                                    ;

in the Anomura there are six free and one partially so. This evidence

might be carried still further, inasmuch as in Astacus and Homanis the coxae

are seen to approximate to each other on the opposite sides closely, while

in Palinurus thej- are near anteriorly and broadly separated posteriorly.

   The appendages that follow are those that are modified for swimming.

When exhibited in the most normal condition, they consist of a long pedun-

cular stalk supporting two oblong leaf-like plates, surroiiuded by a fringe of

small hairs. Sometimes they consist of a scries of multiarticulations, as in

Amphipoda ; sometimes of long cylindiical imiarticular branches, as in Cancer.

In some instances, as in tSquUla, there is a third branch that springs from

the side of the peduncle near the base ; this is so membranoiis in character

and ramified in construction, that it is evidently formed for the purpose of

assisting in aeration of the blood.

The pleopoda are utilized, according to the habits of the animal, for various

purposes, and throughout them all their adaptation to propulsion through the

water is not only the most constant but also very generally associated with

other offices.

In the Isopoda they appear to bo the only organs adapted for respiration

that the animal possesses. Tet their rapid motion is the only means which

the)' possess of swimming.

In the Amphipoda, it is this latter use alone for which these organs are

adapted, while respiration is fulfilled by other means. But here only the ante-
rior three pairs are adapted for swimming purposes, while the posterior three
are utilized for leaping when on laud, or forcibly dashing through the watei-.
The Isopoda have only the posterior pair so variated, and the Macrura have two

pairs; but in this latter order they are more adapted for producing a retro-

grade motion, darting backwards as they frequently do to a^oid unexpected

and sudden danger. In the Macrurous forms they are also available for the

purpose of retaining connexion with the ova, and supporting the life of the
embryo until it is matured. Throughout most of the Macrurous forms the

pleopoda fulfil this doiible purpose in the female.
--94 REPORT 1876.

   In the Anomiira they are only adapted for swimming in the long-tailed
forms ; but in Erachyura they are only utilized for the suspension of ova in
the female, and never used for swimming except in very young animals, and
reduced to two pairs only in the male, where they are interlocked in each
other and adapted as organs aiding intromission,

    I cannot close this portion of the report without expressing great admi-
ration of the valuable memoir of Milne-Edwards, so frequently quoted in

these pages. With the exception of Professor Huxley's Hunterian Lectures,
St. George Mivart's Memoir on the Lobster in the ' Popular Science Eeview,'
and a Memoir on the same subject by J. S. Kingsley, recently published
in the 'American JN^aturalist' (Aug. 1876), little has been written on this

subject of late years.

    It is remarkable that so large and important a class of animals should
have been left so long without being anatomically studied, and it is to be
hoped that the important' part that they must take in the great history of
progressive evolution will gradually induce naturalists to give them the
attention that their importance deserves.

ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.  95

Second Report of the Committee for investigating the circulation of the

    Underground Waters in the Neiv Red Sandstone and Permian Forma-

    tions of England, and the quantity aiid character of the water
    supplied to various towns and districts from these formations. The

   Committee consisting of Professor Hull^ Mr. Binney^ Rev. H. W.

    Crosskey, Captain D. Galton^ Professor A. H. Green, Professor

   Harkness, Mr. H. Howell, Mr. W. Molyneux, Mr. G. H.

   Morton, Mr. Pengelly, Professor Prestwich, Mr. J. Plant,

   Mr. Mellard Reade, Mr. C. Fox-Strangways, Mr. W. Whi-
   taker, and Mr. C. E. Be Rance. Drawn up by Mr. De Range

     [Secretary).

Since the last Meeting of the Association your Committee have continued to

distribute largely the circular forms of inquiry, and a large amount of valu-

able information has been obtained, especially as to the deep wells of Liver-
pool, Birkenhead, Nottingham, and Birmingham. But in several districts, as

in Staffordshire, important information is promised so soon as works now in
I^rogress are completed ; and the members of your Committee taking charge
of those districts have considered it best to defer making a report until they
present you with a final one on their particular areas. Your Committee,

should they be reappointed, have every hope, from promises already received,
of completing the trust which you have given them by the next Meeting

of the Association.

   In the present Report the details of weEs in the New Eed Sandstone are

collected, which yield at Livei-pool no loss than 7,197,330 gallons daily ; at
Birkenhead more than 7 millions ; at Coventry, Birmingham, and Leaming-
ton 4^ millions ; at Nottingham nearly 4 miUiou gallons ; at "Warrington
572,360 gallons ; at Stockport 1,073,820 gallons.

    The largest yield of one individual well is that at Green Lane, Old Swan,
near Liverpool, the average daily yield of which in 1875 amounted to

2,533,050 gallons, and the present maximum of which amounts to no less than
3,243,549 gallons pumped up by three engines, one at least of which is

always at work, from a depth of 136 feet.
    In regard to the Liverpool wells, it appears to be established by the obser-

vation of Mr. Deacon, the Borough Engineer, to quote the words of his Report,
" That the water in the public wells is regularly sinking to a lower level, or
that if it be maintained at a constant level, the water capable of being pumped
is a continually diminishing quantity." But there is not yet sufficient evi-
dence to prove what balance of absolute quantity of water stUl remains in the
sandstones of the area capable of being drawn on by additional wells.

   Amongst the borings, of which the details will be found in the present
Report, is one at Rampside, near Barrow-in-Furncss, which reached a depth
of no less than 2210 feet from the surface, in a fruitless search for coal. At
a depth of 250 feet a spring of water was cut in the Permian Red Sandstone,
which yields 13,500 gallons of water daily, flowing out at the top of a one-
inch pipe, and rising to a height of 12 feet above the surface of the ground.

   The rocks beneath the Permian have been proved by this boring to be of
Yoredale age, the Coal-measures being absent, as stated would j^robably be
the case by Mr. Aveline and other geologists before the boring was carried

out.

   An interesting feature in this boring is the presence of petroleum-oil in

the Yoredale rock near the bottom, which caused the water cut in penetra-

ting this sandstone to be much charged with oil.

9(5  ·  REPORT-- 1876.

     Tour Committee ·would wish to call attention to the publication, since the
 last Meeting, of the sixth and final Eeport of Her Majesty's Commissioners
 appointed to inquire into the best means of preventing the pollution of rivers.
 The volume treats of the Domestic Water Supply of Great Britain, and in

 it the Commissioners state that the New lied Sandstone Rock constitutes one

 of the most effective filtering media known ; and being at the same time a

  powerful destroyer of organic matter, the evidence of previous pollutiou, in

 water drawn from deep wells in this rock, may be safely ignored, " for being

 a porous and ferruginous rock, it exerts a powerful oxidizing influence upon
 the dissolved organic matter which percolates through it. To such an extent
 is this oxidation carried, that in some cases, as in those of the deep-well
 waters supplying St. Helen's and Tranmere, every trace of organic matter
 is converted into innocuous mineral compounds."

     The Commissioners further add that, though the quartz sand constituting

 the bulk of the New Red Sandstone is usually cemeuted together by carbonate

 or sulphate of lime, the hardness of the water is generally modei'ate, and of
 a nature that can be softened by lime, according to Dr. Clark's method, and

 that the " unpolluted waters drawn from deep wells in the New Red Sandstone

 are almost invariably clear, sparkling, and palatable, and are amongst the best
 and most wholesome waters for domestic supply in Great Britain. They, con-
 tain, as a rule, but a moderate amount of saline impurity, and either none or
 but the merest traces of organic impurity. There is every reason to believe
 that a vast quantity of hitherto unutilized water of most excellent quality
 is to be had at moderate expense from this very extensive geological for-
 mation."

     This area is certainly not less than ten thousand square miles in extent in
 England and "Wales, with an average rainfall of 30 inches, of which certainly

 never less than 10 inches per annum percolates into the gi'ouud, which would

 give an absorption of water amounting to no loss than one hundi'ed and forty-
 three millions three hundred and thirty-six thousand gallons per square mile
 per annum, which, on an available area of ten thousand square miles, gives
 an annual absorption of nearly a billion and a half of gallons in England and
 Wales.

   How small a proportion tlie enormous quantities pumped at various stations

(as exemplified in this and the previous Report) bear to the available resources,

will be at once apparent. The abundant balance loft will, we trust, ere long
be made available for those towns and country populations in the Midland
Counties now suffering all the ills so prolifically springing from a polluted

water supply.

   1. The well is situate within a short distance from the town of Ormskirk, on the
N.E. side, and near to Bath Wood. 2. 1:^9-1 ft. above Ordnance datum. 3. From
surface to bottom of well 60 ft. deep, 7 ft. diameter. There is no bore-hole in the
well. 4. Before pumping the water rises to the surface of well ; after pumping
the water stands 2 ft. deep at bottom of well. Ordinary level restored in 2 hours
after pumping. 5. 232,000 galls. 6. The water-level varies slightly in summer
and winter, but has not diminished during the last 10 years. 7. The ordinary level
is affected by local rains within 24 hours afterwards. 8. Analysis of the Ormskirk
water by Dr. Brett, of Liverpool. This water, when left to stand, is perfectly colour-
less, devoid of odour, and pleasant to the taste ; its composition is as follows, the

amount of ingredients being calculated to the imperial gallon :

Chloride of sodium, or common salt                                  grains.
Sulphate of lime, or gypsum

4 to 5 hours to rise to the same level again after pumping. No. 2 well : water

stands 6 It. from surface before pumping and takes 1 to 2 hours to rise to the

hours: No. 2 well about 300,000 galls, per 12 hours. 6, At No. 1 well the

yield is less during the summer months than the winter months, and the yield

is much less all the year round than it was when the well was first sunk some
7 years ago. No 2 well has only been finished some six months ; no variation in

the yield has yet been perceived. 7. Not when the water from the quicksand is

   The numbers in the Table can be converted into grains per imperial gallon
by multiplying them by 7, and then moving the decimal point one place to
the left. The same operation transforms the hardness in the Tables into
degrees of hardness on Clark's scale.

* This must probably mean 18 ft, above level of Elver Ouse. The well is about 30 ft,

Fourth Report of the Committee, consisting 0/ Professor Harkness,

  Prof. Prestwich, Prof. Hughes, Rev. H. W. Crosskey, Prof. W.

   Boyd Dawkins, Dr. Deane, Messrs. C. J. Woodward, L. C.
   MiALL, Gr. H. Morton, and J. E. Lee, appointed for the purpose of

    recording the position, height above the sea, lithological characters,

   size, and origin of the more important of the Erratic Blocks of
   England and Wales, reporting other matters of interest connected

  with the same, and taking measures for their preservation. Drawn

  up bij the Rev. H. W. Crosskey, Secretary.

The Committee has pursued the same course as during former j-ears. The

time for generalization has not yet arrived. There are many erratic blocks

scattered over the country as yet unrecorded, and their character and distri-

bution -svill largelj' aftect any conclusions that may ultimately be reached.

The Committee has for its present duty the collection of facts ; Avhen its

labours have resulted in a complete account of the isolated boulders and

groups of boulders of England, Wales, and Ireland, material now unavailable
will exist for theoretical discussion, and many important incidents in the

history of the glacial epoch will be more accurately determinable.

The importance of the work undertaken by the Committee continues to be

emphasized by the destruction which is constantly going on. AYar is waged

upon the boulders (which in many cases are our only source of information

respecting the epoch to which they belong) by agriculturists, and builders,

and road-makers with unceasing energy. They are built into walls, buried

in the earth, used as foundation-stones, and often lilastcd to pieces ; their

preservation is difficult to secure, on account of their interference with the

cultui'e of the land. In a few years it is not too much to say that the evi-

dence of glacial phenomena will in many districts be almost effaced.

The Committee directs attention to (1) the distribution of erratic boulders

from  different  centres  of ice  action                         (2) the  agencies  by  which  they have
                                                              ;

been transported ; (3) the different periods in the glacial epoch to which they

belong ; (-1) the heights above the sea at which they are found, indicating

large changes in phj'sical geology.

The schedule of inquirj-, indicating the various points of the information

required, printed in a former Report, has been issued, and copies may always

be had on application to the Secretaiy of the Committee.

                                                         DfiVONSHlKE.

   A Very remarkable group of boulders has been reported upon by Mr.

George Doe, of Great Torrington.
    It is found in the estate of Eivalton, in the parish of Langtree, Devon,

about four miles from Great Torrington.

   The dimensions of the largest boulder of the group are 13 ft. X 6 xft. 3 ft.

It is subangular in form ; but there are no groovings or striations. It rests
on clay, close to a small brook, and is about 500 feet above the sea-level.
The only legend connected with it is the old story of its having been thrown
by the Devil.

  ^At the distance of about 25 ft. N.E. is another boulder 3 ft. X Xft. 2| ft.

At a distance of 35 yards are sis small boulders, cropping out from the

ground.
         ON THE EllKATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND AND WALES.           Ill

   At a distance of nearly half a mile are tkree more, similar to the last men-

tioned.

   Near them is a deposit of flints in clay and a gravel-pit.

    All these blocks except the first are south of the large boulder.

   These boiilders consist of felsite, resembling that in many of the " Elvaus."

A felsitic Elvan, at Tresavaen, Gwen-nap, Cornwall, cannot be discriminated

from them. Possibly, however, a nearer locality may be found.

                                                   OXFOEDSHIEE.

    Professor Prestwich describes a boulder found last summer, near Oxford,
in a bed of subangular flint-gravel (high-level river-gravel), at Wolvcrcote
bricli-pit, on the high road from Oxford to Woodstock, at an altitude of
about 40 feet above the level of the river Isis.

   It consisted of a mass of hard saccharoid sandstone of concretionary origin,
some portion of it broken away, and the broken edges quite angular ; it
weighed about three tons. It bore no trace of ice-scratches. There were no
fossils to identify the sandstone ; but from general characteristics. Professor
Prestwich thinks that it is of Tertiary origin. Several smaller boulders, of
from I to 2 or 3 ft. cube, more or less worn, were dispersed irregularly
through the gravel, which is scarcely at all stratifled, and contains no fossils.

         Midland Cotjnties.

   Dr. Deane and your Secretary have examined numerous boulders in the

neighbourhood of Harborne, to W. and S.W. of Birmingham, between the

Hagley and Bristol roads.
   One hundred and sixty rounded and subangular masses of stone have been

examined in this district. Fifty-five of these are clearly traceable to local

--rocks Carboniferous, Permian, or Triassic; the remainder are of distant

origia.

Very few of these travelled boulders are in situ. They have been rolled

or dragged off the land into ditches and by roadsides. Some, when the size
has been convenient, have been used by the " nailers " of the district for

hammering (or rather anvil) purposes.

Ninety are of the varieties of felstone so abundant in the Bromsgrovc

district. About half of these are of small size. Five are of considerable

--magnitude 5 ft. 6 in. x 5 ft. X from 2 to 3 ft. ; the rest are from 2 to 4 ft. in

length and breadth, with variable thickness. One of these felstone boulders

(near Hole Farm, Moor Street, about two miles east of Hales Owen) is

worthy of special notice. Its dimensions are 3 ft. 6 in. x 2 ft. 6 in. x 2 ft.

and it contains in one specimen the three characteristics named in a previous

Areport as occurring separately in the boulders of Bromsgrove,  compact,

almost hornstone-hke matrix contains distinct included fragments and por-

phyritic felspar crystals. This specimen, therefore, confirms the view that
these felstone boulders, which are so numerous to the west and south of Bir-
mingham, as far as and beyond Bromsgrove, are portions of highly indurated

ash-beds.

   At FlaveU's Farm, California, is one boulder of grey granite 2 ft. by
1 ft. 8 in. by 1 ft. Yein-qnartz and quartzite constitute nine small and
three large boulders ; and one of these, found near Harborne station, contains
included brecciated fragments of rock. The size of these quartzite boulders,
112 REFOKT--1876.

the largest of whicli measures 3 ft. x 2 ft. 6 in. x 2 ft., negatives the idea
that they have come from the Bunter pebble-beds.

   The general character of the boulders of this district is similar to that of
the Bromsgrove district ; but in the presence of granite, quartz, and meta-
morphic rock resembles the district north and west of Wolverhampton.

    North and west and south-west of Wolverhampton, however, granite is

very much more abundant than in the district west and south-west of Bir-
mingham. The large boulders north and west and south-west of Wolver-
hampton are, it is probable, chiefly CriiFeU, or (more sparingly) Wigtonshire

granite*; but there is Eskdale granite in the neighbourhood, especially about

Bridgnorth.

   The Welsh felspathic drift covers abundantly the west and south-west of
the Midland tableland, while felspathic rocks from the Lake-district accom-
pany the Eskdale granite, and are often mixed with the Criffell granite.

 --The boulders occur in two distinct positions (1) in the older glacial beds,

(2) in the upper clay.

                     Lancashire.

    Large striated boulders have recently been exposed in the extensive exca-

vations which have been made in the boulder-clay at Bootle, a northern
suburb of Liverpool. The site excavated is intended for new docks, and
extends along the river Mersey, being reclaimed from shore within the tidal

range.

   Mr. G. H. Morton describes for your Committee the position of these
boulders, and gives the following section of the drift deposits which have

been exposed continuously over many acres. The thickness of the various

beds varies considerably according to position, and the middle sands and
gravels often thin out and leave the upper boulder-clay reposing on the

lower.

                     Section,

1. Sand and silt, old Bootle shore      17 feet.
2. Upper Boulder-clay                   15 ,,
3. Sands and gravels
4. Lower Boulder-claj^                   6,,
                                         6,,
    Upper Bunter Sandstone.

The whole of the subdivisions, 1 to 4, repose in succession on the Bunter

Sandstone at that part of the section nearest the old coast-line.

The Lower Boulder-clay contains a much greater quantity of small stones

than the Upper Clay. No large boulders were observed ; but as the Lower

Clay is not exhibited to any considerable depth, it may possibly contain some.

The Middle Sands and Gravels consist of sands which frequently, by the

great increase of rounded pebbles, become gravels, resembling those at Preston

Junction, Wigan, Gresford, and Colwyn.

The Upper Boulder-clay contains comparatively few small smooth stones,

but many large boulders two or three feet in diameter. Many of these

are striated, and are composed of greenstone, but some are Eskdale granite.

These large boulders possibly occur at an average distance of twenty yards

Afrom each other.    large mass of compact gypsum, about 4 feet in dia-

meter, was noticed.

The sections described are still exposed at the present time, August 1876.

                                                  Cumberland.

    Pi-of. Harkness reports that a boulder of Silurian conglomerate (tlie
Queeusbiiry grit of the Geological Survey) occurs at the village of Bothel, in
the parish of Sorpenhow, North Cumberland. In length it is about 20 feet,
in height feet, in breadth 8 feet. It is beautifully striated on the western
side. It is situated between the 400 and 500 feet contour-line, and has been
transported from the north-west portion of DumfriesshirCj having travelled
about forty miles from N.N.AV. to S.S.E.

   This boulder goes by the name of " Samson."
    Prof. Harkness further reports that some fragments of Shapfell (Wastdale
crag) granite occur in a field in the farm of Hindrig, near Duftou, West-
moreland, at about 800 feet above the sea-level. These have for the most
part been blasted, and many fragments occur in the wall adjoining. Some
of the blocks are untouched ; but these are so imbedded in the soil that their

size cannot be determined.
    There are also several small blocks of this granite iu gravels, which Prof.

Harkness regards as Eskars, in a gravel-hole on the farm of Luhau, in the

parish of Edcnhall, about three miles east of this. Near the village of Newton
Eeigny, about two and a half miles west from Penrith, large boulders occur.
They are so imbedded in the soil that their size cannot be determined. They
consist of the Lower Silurian trap of the Lake country. Boulders of the
same kind and of a large size are also seen on the cast side of Newton Moss,
which is a short distance S.W. of the village. The height of these Newton

boulders is about 600 feet above the sea.

         NoKXH Wales.

   Mr. D. Mackintosh contributes the following account of the boulders in

North Wales. An account of previous observations will be found in the

Quart. Journ. of Geol. Soc, Dec. 1874.

Between a mile and a mile and a half west of Llan-y-cil, on the north-

west side of Bala Lake, the glacial striaj in several places average between

45° and 50^ north of geographical west ; and the boulders are of precisely the

same kind as would have come from about the north-west or from the neigh-

bourhood of Llyn Arenig. Both the direction of the stria) and course of the

boulders would cross Bala Lake at nearly right angles to its length ; so that

if the basin of the lake had ever been scooped out by land- ice, this ice must

have come from the soiith-west before the period of the great boulder trans-

portation from the Arenig mountain.

At the south-west end, and along the south-east side of Bala Lake, many

of the boulders are not the same as those from the Arenig mountain, which

are chiefly found on the north-west side ; and they decrease in number north-

eastwards, suggesting the idea that they came from the south-west.

Through the gap immediately south of Mocl Ferna, numbers of boulders

appear to have found their way into Glyn Ceiriog, and cast as far at least as

Chirk. Numerous large boulders have gone nearly duo east along the valley

of the Dee, as far at least as Cefn and Buabon. The east and north-cast

boundary of the Arenig dispersion may be roughly defined as extending from

Chirk by Cefn, Euabon, Wrexham, Caergwrle, Mold, and the east sid«

of Halkin mountain to Holywell, and thence in a Avesterly diicction to tlie

vale of Clwvd. This lino neurlv coincides with the boundary of the great
                                                                                                                 "

northern granitic drift. Both drifts (the Welsh and northern) have, to a slight
extent, crossed the average boundary, and a few small Arenig boulders have
found their way across the estuary of the Dee into the peninsula of Wirral,

where they have become mixed with the very abundant northern drift from

the Lake district and the south of Scotland.
   The western boundary of the Arenig felstone drift would appear to run

from the Arenig range in a N.X.E. direction as far at least as the celebrated
Cefn Cave, near St, Asaph, where, to a slight extent, it has become mixed

with the northern drift, and Ukewise with erratics probably from the neigh-

bourhood of Conway. Few or no boulders from the southern part of the
Snowdon range would appear to have found their way over the high table-

lands situated to the east of Llanrwst and Bcttws-y-coed, the Snowdon dis-

persion having radiated in all directions to short distances only, excepting

towards the south. This Arenig dispersion is one of the most remarkable in

South Britain. The felstone boulders from the Arenig range have radiated

to great distances over an area extending from N.N.E. to E., and to short

--distances from E. to S.E.- that is, over the fourth of a circle. The boulders

have found their way across valleys and over watersheds and high mountains.

In most places they have wholly ignored the configuration of the ground,

excepting where gaps in mountain-ranges have facilitated their transporta-

Ation.     detailed examination of the surface- configuration, viewed in con-

nexion with the positions occupied by the boulders, would seem to favour

the idea that they could only have been carried by floating ice ; but it ought

to be observed that there is an apparent distinction between the large angular

and subangular boulders which are seen chiefly on the surface, and those

smaller and well-glaciated boulders which are found imbedded in the Lower

Boulder-clay at comparatively low levels.

   Among the Arenig felstone boulders, which arc so remarkable for size,

for the unexpected routes thej^ have taken, or for the distances they have

travelled, as to render tliem worthy of being preserved, the following may be

mentioned :--(l) The Cefn boulder, a short distance west of Cefn station,

near Euabon, which measures 15 x 14 feet, and at least 10 feet in depth

(2) the Maendigwycliyn, or great immovable stone in the village of Eryrys,

near Llanarmon (about 5 miles east of Euthin), which measures 15 x 15 x 12

feet, and  is  situated  about 1130 feet  above the sea                                                  (3) a boulder in a field
                                                                                                      ;

near Bryn-Cloddian, north-east of Caerwys railway-station, and a few miles

south-west of Holywell.

The direction of glacial strife on rock surfaces in the eastern part of North

Wales, as well as in the neighbourhood of the Arenig mountain, Corwen, &c.,

in general agrees with the course the boulders have taken. On the summit

of Halkin mountain, in a quarry a short distance west of Holywell, there are

well-defined stria;, indicating the passage of ice from the south-west ; and in

the neighbourhood of Llangollen, especially near Trevor (as lately ascertained

by Mr. Morton, E.G.S.), there are several instances of stria; pointing from

west to east.
              ON THE EXPLORATION OF THE SETTLE CAVES.                  115

Fourth Report of the Committee, consisting o/Sir John Lubbock^ Bart.,

  Prof. Prestwich, Prof. Busk, Prof. T. M'K. Hughes, Prof. W.
  Boyd Dawkins, Prof. Miall, Rev. H. W. Crosskey, and Mr. R.

   H. Tiddeman, appointed for the purpose of assisting in the Explora-

   tion of the Settle Caves [Victoria Cave). Drawn tip by II. H.

   Ti DDE MAN, Reporter.

The Committee have to report that work has been carried on at the Victoria

Cave throughout the year, with the exception of the interval from the 24th
December, 1875, to January 3rcl, 187G, and that the Settle Local Committee

have expended during the year ending August 13th, 1870, the sum of
.£90 13s. M., besides the grant of oElOO entrusted to them by the British

Association.

A considerable amount of work has been done in the course of the year in

Aexcavating the central chamber  and that wliich lies to the right of it,

called D. These, though formerly separate chambers^ are now seen to form

one large one. They consisted at first of mere spaces between the roof and

the cave deposits, which had not been filled up entirely by the latter, branch-

ing off from one another and merely communicating at the bifurcation.

From the lowering of the deposits by excavation, thej' now form only one

large and long entranee-hall to the remainder of the cavern, and the old

line of demarcation can now only be distinguished on the present ceiling by

Athe following circumstance. Chamber  cuts higher into the roof than

chamber D, and is marked off from it b)^ a line of joint, along which a thick

bed of limestone has fallen down on to the floor in chamber A, but still forms

the roof of chamber D. This huge block, which extended a distance of about

60 feet, from about Parallel 1-5 to 44, at the extreme end of chamber A, has

given us great trouble in the course of the year, partly from its size, and also

because, being fissured by cracks here and there and lying on a clayey layer,

it was subject to successive slips. Considerable downfalls threatened from

time to time, and these had to be anticipated by quarrying it away. The

large body of laminated clay which has been described in former reports

ended off for the most part against this block towards the north, and must

have been deposited against it. This is the mass of laminated clay which

overlay the bone-beds containing the older mammals Eleplias anfirpius,

Rhinoceros leptorliinns, Hippopotamus, Ilyccna, and others, with Man.

   There can be no doubt now, to whatever agents the formation of that inter-
esting deposit be due, that there arc somewhat similar beds also underlying

that Pleistocene bone-bed in places. From about 2 feet Parallel 10 as far as
present workings inwards at Parallel 30 an exceedinglj' dark, tough, waxy
clay lies below that layer. It varies much in thickness, from 7 or 8 feet on

the right or east side of the cavern to lesser dimensions towards the west,
and eventually loses itself amongst large fallen blocks of limestone on the

left.

  A thin layer of stalagmite, varying from 8 inches to a mere film, occurs at

the base of the above clay. It is often very fibrous, and in some places it
has a distinctly greenish hue. At the suggestion of the Committee, Dr.
Marshall Watts kindly analyzed it ; and his report is as follows :

   " The mineral is as neai'ly as possible pxire Calcium Carbonate. It contains
no Phosphoric Acid. Its specific gravity is 2-879 ; that of Calcspar varies
from 2-70 to 2-75, and of Arragonite from 2-92 to 3-28, so that for a non-

crystalline deposit of stalagmite the agreement is sufhciently close.
                                                                     (Signed) \V. M. Waits."'

                                                                                      i2
] 16 REPORT-- 1876.

    To return to our section. Here and there this stalagmite rises into small
bosses, showing that its existence was mainly owing to the dripping of water
from the roof. It forms a kind of dotted line of demarcation between the
dark clay above and the layer next to be described beneath.

   The bed beneath this stalagmite is somewhat like the dark clay above it in
arrangement, but is not of so fine a texture. Its colour is much lighter, a
yellowish brown. It is someM'hat sandy, pi'esents on digging a rougher sec-
tion than the waxy lustre of the dark clay above, and is more clearly lami-

nated, though the laminations in it are wider apart. This clay appears to
follow the upper surfaces of the fallen blocks on which it rests, and is rudely

parallel with them. "We find that as these blocks rise in successive steps

towards the south-west, so this clay rises on them, and covers them con-
tinuously at higher and higher levels.

    There is one point about this loM"cr light-brown laminated clay which is

of much interest ; channels appear to have been formed in it. ' HoUow
troughs occur, which may perhaps be due to its subsidence through chinks
in the rocks beneath, or they may have been formed by little streams of

water cutting out channels subsequentlj- to the formation of the main mass
of it. However they were formed, the thin overlying stalagmit* appears to
have made a tliin coating over their walls simultaneously with the like forma-
tion on the flatter surfaces between them. The overlying dark waxy clay,
ou minute examination, is seen to dip into these cavities sometimes at a con-
siderable angle. It is only possible to sec this lamination when the clay is
cut with a clean knife ; the spade obliterates the bedding. This arrange-
ment of the layers at the sides of the trough would seem to point rather to

our first hypothesis of their formation as being the more probable.
    It has been suggested in former reports that the laminated clay which lies

above the Hyaiua-bed may possibly be the result of a deposit from glacier
water at the time of the ice -sheet, it being now distinctly proved that the

animals whose bones occur some distance beneath it existed in that district
at a time prior to that cold period. The chief evidences for this last consist

--of ( I) the superposition of the boulder-deposits at the entrance of the cave

upon the edges of the bone-bed, and (2) the total removal of the remains of
these animals from the oj^en ground in those particular areas where direct
evidence of the former extension of an ice-sheet exists.

    ^,Vc must not forget, however, that further south and east the same
animals arc found in the river-gravels under such circumstances as imjDly
that a cold period occurred also previous to their ranging through the country,
the gravels being of later age than certain glacial beds in the south and east
of England. These facts im^jly that the animals whose bones are found in
the lowest known bone-beds in the Victoria Cave lived in this country in
the course of a well-raarked interval between two periods of extreme cold,
and that the earlier left traces of its effects further south than the later. It

is therefore within the limits of possibility that this lower waxy laminated

clay is a representative in time of some of the earlier glacial beds of the
south-east of England. The subject, however, is an extremely wide one,
and our present knowledge of the age and succession of the drifts must

receive many additions before such an hypothesis can be either proved or

disproved.

  --Bronze Objects. The Eomano-Celtic layer is probably now completely

eliminated from Chamber A. That portion of the present large entrance-

Dhall which we used to call Chamber was apparently never occupied by

the folk who used the bronze articles. Chamber B,'that to the left of
ON THE EXPLORATION' OF THE SETTLE CAVES.                        Ii7

Chamber A, may still, perhaps, contain some relics of that period ; but Ave

have not worked in that chamber for some years ; our finds of articles of

that age are consequently rare and exceptional. On the i2th of Tebruary,

1876, whilst blasting and removing a portion of the huge fallen mass of lime-
stone already referred to, a bronze harp-shaped fibula was found, in good
preservation, with traces of its iron pin. It was in Parallel 10, 5 feet left

of the datum-line, and at a depth of 9 feet, below a chink in the limestone
block ; and, as Mr. Jackson suggests, there is every probability of its having

fallen down the crack from above. Whether dropped there by one of vhe
cave refugees, or fallen down a crack which had been enlarged by the settle-
ment of the blocks consequent on the explorations, is immaterial. It was
certainly far below its natural level, and the block of limestone beneath which

it was found extended up to the Eomano-Celtic floor.
   Another object in bronze was found during the year upon the old upper

tip. It is in the form of an ovate leaf, with a broad midrib and rude vein-

ing ; the apex of the leaf is broken off. Where the leaf-stalk would be is

a quadrate expansion pierced with a rivet-hole. It is 1-5 inch long and

I'l inch broad, and cui-ved in the direction of its length.

 --Animal Remains. Professor Busk has again kindly examined the bones,

--and given their determination in a register. He remarks :

   " As usual, the collection is chiefly interesting on account of the large pro-
portion of Ursine remains, some of which, as you Avill perceive, I am inclined

to assign to Ursus spela:us ; but most belong to the ferox type, whilst some few
could not be well distinguished from Vrsus arctos. Some of the bones arc
remarkably perfect, and have the same polish as that already recorded. The

only addition to the former fauna, if I remember rightly, is Mustela martes.

There is also a remarkably small fox, but not Canis lagopus.

                                  (Signed) G. Btjsk."

Amongst the remains returned by Prof. Busk is a lower jaw of Weasel.

This was found in the Lower Cave-earth, beneath the boiilders ; so that that
is another addition, besides the Marten, to our list of animals from the early

Pleistocene layer.

 --In speaking of the animals found, the place of honour necessarily falls to

the Hycena not by reason of the number of his remains discovered, but because

to him we are indebted for by far the larger number of bones of other animals

introduced. It is, indeed, singular to note that, notwithstanding the abun-

dant evidence of his presence, from the characteristically gnawed and cracked

bones of other animals, we have hardly any remains of him this year except

teeth. There can, indeed, be scarcely a doubt that a dead hyrena was as

acceptable to his survivors as the carcass of any other beast.

WeOf Bear we have found a fine series of tusks.  have already given

AProf. Busk's remarks upon them.  very large humerus, which he attri-

butes to the Grisly Bear, was found in Parallel 21, at a depth of 12 feet.

From the way in which its proximal extremity has been gnawed off, and

some of its more prominent ridges removed, there can be no doubt that it

was coexistent with Hy.xna. Some remains of very young Bears have been

--found so young, indeed, as to make it doubtful whether they ever had an

independent existence.

   Of Bhinoeevos we have a femur, found in Parallel 30, at a depth of 7 ft. 6 in.

It has been gnawed, as such bones always are, by the Hyajna, and to the usual
extent. Several exceedingly fine teeth of Rhinoceros have been found since
the bones were submitted to Prof. Busk, and their determination must be for

the present postponed, A lower premolar 4 of Rhinoceros, which was the
118 KEPOET ISrO.

first of that animal found in the cave, together with the human fibula, and
hitherto supi3osed to ho B. tichorinus, is now considered by Prof. Busk to be

H. leptorhinus.

Of Deer found this year we have several. One is a base of an antler with

brow-tine (Cervus tarandus), but the species is marked as doiibtful; another

tine is doubtfully referred to C. elaplius ; another is a fragment of a very

large antler, and no species is assigned to it ; also there is a patella of a very

large deer, which was near the surface.

Of Gout several remains have been found; and it would almost seem pos-

sible, from the depth to which some of them occur, that this animal may have

existed in Britain at an earlier age than has usually been assigned to it ; but

we cannot put forward this idea confidently without further confirmation.

One humerus of an exceedingly small Goat has cuts upon it which are evi-

dently human worknifinship ; but there are circumstances which render it

desirable to reserve any further remarks upon it to a future occasion.

In our last year's report we called attention to the existence in the Victoria

Cave of a " fauna which we may confidently assign to a cold climate, separated

in some parts, by an accumulation of deposits 12 feet or more in thickness,

from an earlier one, which is equally characteristic of high temperatures

whereas in another part of the cave not far oft', where the material to separate

them is wanting, we have animals from icy and tropical countries inter-

mingled in a confusion which would be puzzling did we not get the clue hard

by." AVe remarked that it was evident that the separation was natural and

regular, the mixture abnormal and accidental. "As distinguished from the

lower bed, the chief characteristics of the upper were the presence of the llein-

deer, and the absence of Elephant, Ehinoccros, Hippopotamus, and Hyaena."

Tliese remarks were made solely on the evidence which passed through your

present reporter's hands since he undertook to conduct the ex2)loration of the

cavern. Prof. W. Boyd Dawkins has kindly written to remind us that Rein-

deer was found in the lower cave-earth, below the laminated clay, when he

had charge of the explorations, and he has no doubt that it was dragged in

by Hyffinas. The Hyaena-bed at that spot, viz. the mouth of the cavern, was

at a depth of 16 feet below the laminated clay ; and your reporter had an

impression that the Reindeer-remains occurred at some height above the

Hyiena-bed. Be that as it may. Prof. Dawkins's ojnnion is entitled to great

weight, and is, indeed, the view generally held. At the same time, consider-

ing that Hyaena and Reindeer are not uncommonly found together in caves,

when, as in this case, we see them mixed together at one or both ends of a

section but separated through an interval of 70 feet in length by a thickness

of deposits, we may regard the fact as at least an interesting one, and, when

found, noteworthy.

Tlie excavations still throw light upon how the Cave was formed. As far

as we have yet worked at the present level, the right wall of tlie cave is seen

to have been hollowed out by streams. Several grooves occur, indicating

water-levels ; but, except quite at the entrance, we have not got down to the

Weancient floor.    are ah'cady working in deposits Avhich are probably of

greater age than the older Thames gravels. The river is now running

900 feet below us. What earlier records wc may disentomb wc cannot tell

we must work on and wait.
OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS.  119

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors during the year 1875-76,

                                                            [Plate IV.]

The principal subjects of discussion in the present Eeport are, as they have

been in former years, the descriptions of meteors and meteor-showers of
whicli the Committee has received information during the interval of a year
which has elapsed since the presentation of the last Report.

    Of such materials a large supply has as usual been contributed to, or has
been sought for by, the Committee. Most of the appearances described are
fireballs of an occasional character, some of which have given rise to a good
deal of remark and scientific discussion in the public journals of the day,
both from the exceptional character of brightness and from the quick re-

petitions of their occurrence.

    Large fireballs were seen on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th of September last,
which were observed over such a considerable extent of country as to allow
of their real heights and paths to be calculated with a somewhat unusual
degree of accuracy. The paths of these meteors were calculated by Captain
G. L. Tupman, of the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich ; aud very satisfactory
conclusions were arrived at as to the proljable meteor-showers or systems to
which these large fireballs, two of which were detonating, appear pretty
certainly to have belonged.

    Other instances have occurred where bright fireballs have been seen at
several points in England sufficiently far apart, and have been observed with
sufficient accuracy to lead to definite although not generally more than very
rough determinations of their actual heights, velocities, and directions. One
of the largest of these bolides was seen in bright sunshine on the 22nd of
December, 1875 ; another of great brilliancy was noticed on the evening of
July 25th, 1876 : of these meteors, as only a few well-recorded descriptions
were obtained, the probable real paths are only generally indicated, or have
only hitherto been provisionally computed. Meteors of this conspicuous cha-
racter appeared also on the 16th of August, 1875, aud on the 15th of April,
llth,13th, loth, and21st of August in the present year. Some heights of shoot-
ing-stars observed in the August shower in 1874, and described in the Cata-
logue of last year's Eeport, are deduced from the observations, and are hero
presented as completely as the accuracy of the observations would permit.

    The occurrences of meteor-showers during the past year have been very
slight and ill-defined, with the exception of the August-shower displays of
1875 and of the present year. The present year's recurrence of the August
shower was, however, less plentiful than has been visible for several years
past, and has amounted to a real minimum of intensity of its annual appa-

ritions.

   A new general catalogue of meteor radiaut-points, with an accompanying

key-map, compiled diulng the past year by Mr. Greg, appears in the Eeport,
and a valuable contribution of reviews of the past year's records and exami-

nations of aerolites (of which the many remarkable occurrences continue to

increase in scientific importance year by year), by Dr. Flight, concludes its
pages. One of the most interesting of such events, it will be recollected, took
place this year in England, when a mass of iron weighing 7| lbs. fell at

Eowton, near the Wrekin ; and this, it may be observed, is only the seventh

instance where a mass of metallic iron of meteoric origin, or an aerosiderite,
has actually been seen to fall. This event took place in Shropshire, at 20
minutes to 4 o'clock p.m., on April 20, 1876.

138 REPORT---1876.

                                             APPENDIX.

                         I. Meteoes Doubly Observed.

In the list of observations presented with last year's Report, several

exarajjles of meteors doubly observed, chiefly in the August meteor-shower

in 1874, occurred, and the heights and real paths of these meteors have been

calculated. The computed real paths and velocities, and the radiant-points

from which the meteors were directed, are shown in the Table opposite.

It is probable that few observations are sufiiciently trustworthy to give

correct values of the speeds of individual meteors ; but among several

such determinations the average velocity of the Perscids here found may be

regarded as approximately ascertained, and it does not greatly exceed the

value which theory assigns to it. The real path and radiant-point of the

fireball of August 10th, 1874, has been recalculated, as weU as the velocity

from tlie average of two observed durations of its flight ; the calculated speed

is within a mile of the velocity- of a bod}'^ moving in a parabolic orbit from the

direction of the radiant determined by its apparent paths. The latter point

is very near a known radiant-point of a shower to which it may be presumed

that this large fireball belonged, and a marked centre of radiation of

shooting-stars near (^ e Aquarii, duiing the annual shower of Pcrsei'ds, is

thus probably confirmed by this double observation. The recorded tracks of

the fireball at Birmingham and Xewcastle-on-Tyne diverge from a centre

at R.A. .313°, S. Decl.  14°                 and  a radiant-point from the 3rd to the 31st of
                                          ;

August is shown by Dr. Schmidt's investigations to be observable at E.A.

306°, S. Decl. 8°. The star e Aquarii (R.A. 310°, 8. Decl. 10°), near this, at

some distance from which several other radiant-points for July and August

are clustered in Aquarius, occupies the extreme west, while the latter radiants

more nearly adjoin a star (Il.A. 333°, S. Decl. 8") which is in the eastern

part of the same constellation *.

In the list of large meteors which accompanies this Report, an observation

of a large fireball on August lOtli, 1875, at lU'' 26"" p.m., near St. Agnes,

Cornwall, is described, of which two other descriptions also appeared in ' The

Times' of August 21st and 25th, showing that the meteor was A^sible over

a very wide area, from Wales to Erittanv in France.

Ty Mawr, Ty Llangelly, near Criekhow"ell ; Mr. H. Ball.--" On August 16th,

at lO"* 26"' P.M., I saw a very bright meteor, which is probably the same as

that seen by your correspondent F.R.S., from St. Agnes, Cornwall. From

this place its position was nearly 5° below and to the right of the full moon,

on a line inclined 4.5° to the horizon."

 --Redon, Lower Brittany, France'; F.R.G.S. " It may be worth while

mentioning that the meteor seen in Cornwall and Wales was also seen by

me at Redon, Lower Brittany, at the same time. It was exceedingly bril-
liant, and, as F.R.S. remarked, it much resembled a string of magnesium

beads. The night was singularly clear and the moon very bright, but the

   * In the copy of Schmidt's list of radiant-points printed in the vohime of these Eeports
for 1874, p. 321, it should have been observed that the positions to which days as well as
months of duration are assigned are asterisked in the original list as accurately (tlie rest
being less accurately) determined. The radiants near 9 Aquarii in Schmidt's and
Tupman's lists are erroneously quoted in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
Society (vol. xxxvi. p. 218) as being the " nearest known "' radiants to the above deecribed
point of emanation of this meteor's real course.

light of the meteor Avas very striking ; it appeared to luc to be moviug

slowly in a comparatively horizontal course."

The most important instances when duplicate observations of meteors were

collected during the past year, permitting tlio height and direction of the

meteors' real paths to be determined and very accurate results to be obtained,

occurred on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th of September, 1875. It would occupy

too large a space in these Eeports to relate at length the various accounts

that were published of these meteors ; and those which offered the greatest

accuracy of description and position only arc hero extracted from the compa-

rison and reduction of a great many excellent records of their appearance

published by Captain Tupman in the ' Astronomical llegister' for April 1876.
--AMeteor of September 3rd, 1875, 9'' 52'" p.m.
                                                 meteor ending with a

flash almost as blinding as the sun, seen by G. L. Tupman at the Eoyal

Observatory, Greenwich, with au apparent diameter of about 15' of arc,

falling exactly vertically in 1| or 2 seconds to a point less than 1° below
and rather less than this to tlie loft of k Aquilse, from a distance of some 20°

above that point. It diminished in brightness at first, but disappeared with

a flash at last, having about lialf the moon's apparent diameter, as far as its
brilliancy allowed the eye to estimate apparent dimensions of its disk, and it

appeared globular and left no streak on its course.
   This is the description given of it by Captain Tupman, and similar accounts

of its path and appearance were. obtained at other places. At Tedstonc Dcla-
mere Eectory, near YV^orcester, it was visible in the S.E. by S. falling verti-
cally, and also falling vertically at the Eadcliffe Observatory, Oxford, by
Mr.' Lucas ; while at Leighton Buzzard the direction of its path was also
vertically downwards ; and its appearance at all these places was extremely

brilliant'. The radiant-point of this meteor was very nearly in the zenith at

the time of its appearance ; and from the positions of its apparent course

furnished by the diff'creut observers, Captain Tupman concluded approxi-

mately its real course, as will be seen in the annexed Table (p. 144) of the real
paths of this large meteor and of two other brilliant fireballs which appeared

a few days later in the same month*.
   The second large meteor generally observed in the southern parts of

England in the first week of the same month appeared at 11'' 21'" p.m.,
September 7th, 1876 ; and eight or nine reliable obsei-vations of its apparoit
course at different places, principally in Kent or Surrey, and Essex, and at
Ipswich and Oxford, were collected and compared together by Captain Tup-

man. Among these are dcsciiptions by the observers at the Royal Observa-

tory, Grreenwich, and at the lladclifte Observatory, Oxford. It appears to
have been of somewhat less splendour than the other two bright fireballs of
which numerous accounts in the beginning of September were obtained ; but
yet, as seen from Writtlc near Chelmsford, almost immediately below its
real point of disappearance, it M'ill be seen, from Mr. H. Corder's excellent
description of itt which foUows, that its light was sufficient to illuminate all

objects with a bright flash, and that a very distinctly audible detonation

followed its disappearance.

   " I did not see it at first, but heard that it rose upwards from the S.W.

   * The details of llie various descriptions, and a valuable series of conchisions and
deductions from them, will be found in au article communicated by Captaiu Tupman in
the ' Astronomical Kegister ' for April 1876. The final results of his calculations of
these meteors' real paths are also contained in the number for February, 1876, of the

' Monthly Notices ' of the Astronomical Society, vol. xxxvi. p. 216.

 [? S.E.], bursting like a skyrocket into a number of pieces, then fading away
 and bursting out again. At first it was of a blue colour. It was sufficiently

 brilliant to light up the country. When I saw it it had just passed above

 a Andromedse, and was of a decided mauve tint and double. It rushed along
 at a great speed, with an unsteady flickering light of great brilliancy, and
 disappeared near the cluster [j^] in Perseus. It left no train, but was followed
 by a few sparks. One minute and three quarters after disruption I heard a
 double explosion like the firing of a double-barrelled gun at a distance, fol-
 lowed for about 15 seconds by a roUing sound like distant thunder. I also
heard that on the Friday previous (the 3rd of September) a bright meteor was
 seen, just befoi-e 10 p.m., bursting into several red sparks. It went about in

 a direction N. to S.''
     Another well-described account of the magnitude and appearance of the

bolide of September 7th is that of Mr. W. A. Schultz, who saw it at

Lewisham (near London), Kent, and writes that it appeared to be three

 times the apparent size of the planet Jupiter, of bluish-white colour,

leaving a fine train. The nucleus was of extreme brilliancy, and emitted
magnificent blue and red sparks. Its duration was 1^ second. From Mr.

Corder's account near Chelmsford it appears that the fireball detonated, or
broke up and disappeared with an audible explosion, the sound of which
occupied 1| minute in reaching his position. This being, according to the
calculated real place of the meteor at disappearance (21 miles above a point

near Wilham in Essex), about 2i5 miles distant from his place of observation

(a distance which sound takes 1TM 50'' to travel at its ordinary speed in air),
it affords a satisfactory' ground for the conclusion that this fii-eball, although
not so brilliant as that which preceded it on September 3rd, was yet certainly
of the detonating or " aerolitic " class, which was also the character of the
fireball of 14th September, to be next described.

    This was one of the largest meteors which has been visible in England
for several years ; and numerous notices of it were published in the daily
newspapers, in addition to which several private accounts of its appearance
were collected by the Committee, and more particularly by Captain Tupman,
who himself observed the meteor, and who has compared together all the

available descriptions. Omitting details of the apparent positions of the
meteor's path by the stars, which have been recorded and carefully reduced

by Captain Tupman in the above-mentioned communication in the ' Astro-

nomical Ilegister," the following are some of the particulars recorded at
diff'erent places of the meteor's brightness and general appearance.

  --IS'ear the Iloyal Observatory, Greenwich, Sept. 14th, 8" 27^'", G.M.T.,

Captain Tupman states: "The fireball was very bright, but of ordinary

appearance, three or four times brighter than Venus ; long train ; left no
streak ; colour white ; motion slow and stately. I estimated the duration at
two seconds, perhaps more ; but I did not count. Lieut. Neate, R.N"., saw
it from the Observatory grounds, but lost it behind a roof at mid course,
after seeing it for two seconds. Colour deep yellow, with red lower edge.
Time 8.27 p.m."

 --Train Inn Station, near Hereford, S'' 30'" p.m. The Eev. T. J. Smith

describes the colour as a beautiful greenish blue of intense brightness, even

in the strong moonlight. The train narrow and straight, of red sparks,
which continued longer than the light of the head. It aj^peared to extin-

--guish without any detonation.
   Near Wisbech, Mr. S. H. Miller writes : " I was driving towards the

west, and the moon shining brightly in a cloudless sky, when my attention
              OBSKRVATION9 0¥ LUMINOUS METEOKS.   141

was attracted towards the north by the bright light of this beautiful meteor.

At first it was as large as Venus thi-ee times magnified, and of a blue colour.

In about a second it passed into the pear-shape, leaving a thin streak behind

it. [The appearance of a fireball seen at Wisbech on March 4th, 1872 (see

these lleports for 1872, p. 76), "like a drop of molten silver," is here referred

to by Mr. Miller as exactly resembling the aspect which this fireball assumed

at its greatest brightness.] In another second it diminished to the size of

a star of third magnitude and appeared yellow. There was no explosion,

but it disappeared about 15° from the horizon."'

Other ||descriptions at Teignmouth, Wath near Eotherham, Halstead in

Essex, Faringdon in Berks, York, Ludlow, Bath, Cambridge, and Manchester

agree in describing the luminous appearance of sparks, corruscations, and light

flakes accompanying the meteor as confined to a short flaming and flickering

tail, sometimes divided, following the head, somewhat redder than the fore-

most brightest part, which had an apparent width of i or |, while the whole
apparent length of the oval disk of the meteor was fully equal to or some-

what surpassed one lunar diameter, and the nucleus collapsed on nearing

the horizon without any signs of an explosion. Some portions of the train

--of sparks appear to have been of more persistency than the rest, as an observer

at Sudbury, Sufi'olk, writes : " The shooting-star itself was very large

and bright ; and attached was a long tail, broken at about a third of its length

from the end into dashes and dots of bright colours, leaving a white track

behind for several seconds after the meteor itself had disappeared." The

accounts at other places describe a flame-like tail and sparks following the

head, although not a persistent light-streak left iipon the meteor's course.

An observer at Duxford, near Cambridge, saw not only the meteor but the

sparks also througJi an ordinary white calico window-blind, which was cloiun

at the time.

As regards the meteor's brightness, its light at some points of observation

fully equalled and perhaps surpassed the intensity of full moonlight. In a

letter to Mr. Glaisher, an observer at St. Ives, Hunts, Mr. J. King "Watts,
relates that the meteor " started into view from Ursa Major immediately

opposite the moon ; it travelled slowly, was of the most intense bright white

light, round, and five or six times the size of any of the planets. The sky

was clear and cloudless. "VVe were travelling between the moon and the

meteor, and our shadows on the road caused by the moon were of course

large and clear, but those caused by the meteor were more clear and more

Asharply defined."  notice of no less interest and importance (but with which

no name and locality were given) appeared in the ' Northumberland Daily

Express,' affording good proof of the intensity and duration of the meteor's
light. " There was a tree in the passage ; and suddenly I found myself sur-

rounded by a wonderfully bright light, and the shadow of the tree was cast

on the wall on my left, every leaf and twig more distinctly than in the sun-

shine." Believing the light to proceed from a window in the house, and per-

ceiving it to come from beyond the house, the observer stepped back a few

paces to the corner, and was just in time to see a most brilliant meteor de-
scending towards the earth. " It did not burst or explode in any way, but

gradually diminished till it became extinct." The glare of the meteor's light

on the ground, already strongly lighted up by the moon, attracted Mr. J. AV.

Proctor's attention to it when driving north-westwards from Grimstone

towards York ; and an observer near Carlisle, driving southwards to that

--town from Longtown, describes the meteor's appearance thus: " At 8'' 2.5TM a

meteor of most dazzling brightness caught my eye. I saw it first apparently in
142 REPORT--1876.

close proximity to the full moon, -which hy the side of the meteor appeared
quite pale. In colour it was not xiulike a Roman candle [white or blue].
It moved very slowly through the sky, in a direction westwards and down-
wards." [The direction assumed in the calculations is towards the point iv**
or 20TM indicated by the hands of a clock, having the moon at the centre of

the dial.]

   The earth-point of this meteor, as concluded from the observations by Cap-
tain Tupman, or the place where the meteor's real path prolonged would
have reached the ground, is in the neighbourhood of Sedburgh, a town in the
extreme north-west part of Yorkshire, and not far south-south-eastwards
from Carlisle. The point of disappearance was at a height of only 13 or Id-
miles above the earth's surface, not far from Pately Bridge, West Eiding,
Yorkshire. The distance of this latter point from Wath, near Eotherham,
is about 47 miles, which sound Avould traverse, with its ordinary speed in air,

in about 3'" 47*. Mr. W. M. Burman, who saw and describes the meteor as it

appeared at this place, heard a detonation which, from its close agreement
with the calculated time required by the sound of the meteor's disruption at

--disappearance to reach him, was probably a distinctly audible sound of its

explosion. He writes: "The magnificent meteor of Tuesday night, Sept.

14th, was well seen here in a cloudless sky at S"" 26"" G.M.T. I was walk-

ing, and the full moon was throwing my shadow on the wall on my right,
when suddenly a dazzling light shone around, and my shadow vanished from

the wall. Upon looking up, I saw this magnificent meteor slowly careering

across the sky, quite overpowering the light of the moon. It passed nearly

overhead, and disappeared in the N.W. by W. It was of a half-moon shape,

the preceding part being convex and sharp, the following part flame-like and

flickering, and of a brilliant bluish-white colour. No red tinge was seen
from first to last, nor train, nor sparks. Its diameter was about half that

of the moon. In that dazzling light it was impossible to see any star ; but
soon after it had passed I tried to make out its path*. Its total visibility
was about 6 seconds ; but I only saw it during 4 or 4| seconds, as it wect
behind the roof of an adjacent house; but a friend (who saw the end of its
course from a neighbouring place) says that it simply disappeared, no sparks
being visible, nor any change of colour. Three and a half minutes after it
disappeared I heard a sharp and sudden explosion, like the report of a small
cannon at a distance, exactly from the direction that the meteor had taken

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

but whether it had any thing to do with the meteor or not I cannot tell."

Mr. Burman adds that " the rumbling of a distant train prevented me from

hearing any sound during the passage of the meteor, if any such were

audible; " and it was, in fact, remarked by several who described the meteor,

that while it was in sight a rushing or hissing sound accompanied its pas-
sage through the air. Passing over these descriptions as impressions of very
doubtful positive reality, the case of such a sound recorded at York by Mr.

--Proctor may perhaps be explained as due to a real detonation, of which he

gives the following description at that place: "I have some impression that
it Avas accompanied or followed by a rushing sound, and a friend of mine

thought the same, but amounting to an explosion at a great distance." In
a note of some length in ' Nature ' (vol. xii. p. 460) on large meteors in the

    * Mr. Burnian's positiou, so nearly under the brigLtest portion of the meteor's track,

may have led to its extreme brightness biding and OTerpowering the sparks and duller
fragments which, at more distant stations, are said to hare attended and followed tho

meteor in some part of its course as a train of redder colour than the head.
OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  143

early part of September, 1875, particulars of the appearance of that of
September 14th as seen at Bradford are extracted from the ' Bradford Ob-
server' of September 15th, where it is related that "to a spectator it bore
the appearance of some solid body in a state of combustion, the sparks flying
out on all sides, and a track of flame being left after its passage. Its passage

was accompanied by a noise as of a loud explosion, which was plainly heard,
not only by those who were outside, but by persons inside the houses who

did not see the aerolite itself. All parties concur in saying that so strong a

light was cast around that a newspaper could easily be read for the space of

half a minuto."
   It should be remarked as a curious coincidence, not unfrequently recorded

in the accounts of large meteors, that a companion fireball of the brilliant
meteor of September 14th was noticed by one observer of its appearance, Mr.

J. J. Allinson, at Lynn, Norfolk, states that " at 8** 20TM p.m., the moon
shining brilliantly in a cloudless and clear sky, I saw very low down in the

eastern heavens a bright meteor of a bluish colour, three or four times the
size and two or three times the brightness of Venus at her largest and
brightest. The bearing was about E. by N., and it seemed moving in a
northerly direction, but, by its getting larger, to be approaching the spot
where I was standing. I should say it disappeared before reaching the

horizon. [There is little doubt. Captain Tupman observes, that this meteor
belonged to the same meteor-system as the much larger companion fireball

by which it was shortly followed.] About 4 or 5 minutes afterwards, whilst
looking in a south-westerly direction, I was attracted by a bright light in the
north-western sky, and on looking towards that quarter observed a most
splendid meteor, about the size and colour of the first, but much more
brilliant, descending from near the last star [>;] in the tail of the Great Bear
in an almost vertical, but I should say somewhat irregular course." Of the
former of these two fireballs no corresponding observations (as it must have
been seen over distant parts of the North Sea or over Belgium) from other places
have hitherto been obtained ; but from its central position over the midland
and northern counties of England, observations of the second extremely bright
meteor of the pair were recorded abundantly at all stations throughout the
country, as has been described, from its interest and importance, in the fore-

going paragraphs at considerable length.

   Both this large fireball and that which preceded it on Sept. 7th may be

presumed from these descriptions to have been " aerolitic " or detonating

ones ; and it is remarkable that they had nearly a common radiant-point, and

that this point of divergence or real direction of the two meteors' flights is

in close agreement with well-established radiant-points of shooting-stars in
the first half of September, to which the observations of Ileis and Schmidt, and
the meteor-shower lists of Greg and Tupman, all agree in assigning very nearly
corresponding places and durations. The following Table, p. 144 (from the
'Monthly Notices' of the Astronomical Society stij). cit.), describes the results
of calculation from observations of these three large meteors ; and the closing
words of his communication to the 'Astronomical Eegister' (from which the

foregoing particulars are extracted) will here describe the astronomical deter-

minations obtained by Captain Tupman as regards the actual orbits and the
probable known showers or systems of ordinary shooting-stars to which the

last two detonating fireballs of these three bright September meteors may, in
all probability, be conjectured to have belonged.

 --Regarding the second, which, like the last of these meteors, was probably

aerolitic. Captain Tupman observes : " It had two heads, one close behind the

other, or it divided itself at mid course, the two parts slowly increasing their
distance apart by retardation of the hindermost as they rushed through some
50 miles in something under 3 seconds of time. This appears to be a proof
of sensible retardation by the density of the atmosphere, although its pres-

sure could hardly have exceeded two tenths of an inch of mercury. Had the

meteor remained in existence another second it would have fallen into the
village of Castle Hedingham, 5 miles S."W. of Sudbury. The heated matter
left behind it in the form of a tail was visible along 10 or 15 miles of its

path " *. On the resemblance of the orbit of the last of the three meteors

--to that of the second, the following considerations are also adduced : " The

astronomical radiant-point is within 15°, probably within 10° of that of the

meteor of Sept. 7th. The two meteors were also similar in character, and
they appear to have moved with nearly equal velocity, something under 20

miles a second. This part of the heavens has also been known for many

years as a radiant-region for shooting- stars at this period of the year.

   " The mean of the two found by Schmidt is within 3° of the Sept. 14 fire-
ball radiant, and the mean of the other three is as close to the Sept. 7
radiant. The old positions, therefore, receive a genuine and unexpected
confirmation from these two fireballs, the radiants obtained for which are
certainly quite as accurate as the others, and merit being classed as new

determinations."

   An interesting notice (as observed above) of the remarkable fireballs of the

first two weeks in September appeared in ' Nature ' of Sept. 23rd, 1875 (vol.
xii. p. 460), in the course of which some particulars similar to those related

above of the appearances of these splendid meteors are described.

   Among the few accurate descriptions which were obtained of the large

daylight fireball of the 22nd of December, 1875, the accounts of its appear-
ance by observers at Dorking, at Southampton, and near Ware are included
in the list of large meteors accompanying this Report. The following obser-

vation of it by Mr. T. W. Webb (' Nature,' vol. xii. p. 187) furnishes some

further extremely valuable notes of its apparent course.

* It should be observed that in his investigations of the stonefall of Pultusk (Jan. 30,

1868) it was shown by Galle that the area upon which the stones fell was vertically below

the point of the fireball's disappearance (twenty miles above the earth), and not, as might

have been anticipated, in the line of the meteor's obliquely descending course prolonged
Aonwards from that point to meet the earth's surface.
                                                       drawing of the fireball of Sep-

tember 7, 1875, from a sketch at the time, was recently communioated to the Committee
by Mr. H. Corder, representing his view of the meteor in the end part of its course, which

he observed. After a bright disruption into several pieces (seen by other observers),

two large nuclei were visible, not following each other, but moving side by side, equally

bright and tapering, and one of them about half a length in advance of the other, with
Aa clear interval of about one diameter of each between them.
                                                                   very small fragment

was also visible, which disappeared quickly, while the two heads continued their course,

with scarcely any changes of brightness or of relative position, from near o Andromedre to

near x Pcrsei. where  they died out     rather suddenly, leaving   no streaks, almost together.
The sound came from   the S.E., where                              the east, where it died away
                                       the meteor burst, not from

and persons who saw it before the disruption said that the meteor was then a single body.

--146 REPORT 1876.

  --Hay, S. Wales. " Dec. 22. As our servants -were sitting at dinner by the

kitchen -window, two of them were startled by the sudden appearance of a

brilliant meteor, apparently descending in the east, with a little inclination

to north. It was not so large as the moon, but much larger than Saturn or
Mars; white and like lightning, with a very quick course, leaving a train as

broad as itself, and preserving its full size tiU lost behind the top of au oak
tree at a little distance, whose branches, though leafless, seem to have con-
cealed it from view. The next day I found, by means of a compass and
joined ruler, that its azimuth was E. by N., its inclination towards north
about 10°; the upper window-frame, where it probably came in sight, 48°,
and the top of the tree about 18° above the horizon. I have not as yet
heard of any other observation of this remarkable meteor. The position of

Hardwicke Vicarage, where it was seen, according to the Ordnance Map is
long. W. 3° 4' 23", lat. N. 52^ 5' 20"."

  A comparison of this account with the observation at Braughing by Mr.

Daw affords a rough detenmination of the real path and direction and of the

probable place and altitude of this unusually bright meteor's course above

the earth's surface ; but owing to the absence of estimates of the duration of
its flight, no probable value of the meteor's real velocity can bo assigned.
The course of this daylight meteor appears to have been from about 45 miles

above the southern part of AVarwickshire to about 15 miles above the centre
of Northamptonshire, disappearing about 50 miles from Mr. Daw's position
near Ware, in Herts, where he states that no sound of an explosion fol-
lowing its appearance could be perceived. The direction of its flight was
from a radiant-point at about E. A. 250°, N. dccl. 20° (near /3 Herculis), distant
about 45° above and westward from the apparent place of the mid- winter

sun, which was shining brightly above the southern horizon when the meteor
came in sight*.

   The bright meteor seen in twilight on April 15th, 1876, at Biistol and
Hawkhurst (see the accompanying fireball-list), must have passed over Ire-
land or the Irish Channel far west from Bristol, as the position of its apparent
path there, near the setting planet Yenus, differed very little from the simi-
lar account of its ajiparent path in Kent. The position of its radiant-point
cannot have been the usual one in Virgo (about 196°, -j-0) in the early part of
April, as its recorded path at Bristol, prolonged backwards nearly parallel to
the ecliptic, crosses the constellation Virgo about 20° south of the equator in
the neighbourhood of this position, proceeding from the direction of a region
where no well-established radiant-point of ordinary shooting-stars has hitherto
been observed.

   The next large meteor, of which many contemporaneous observations were

communicated to the Committee, some of which have also appeared in the
daily newspapers, was that of July 25, 1876, about 10'' 5" p.m. Several ac-
counts of this fireball are contained in the list of large meteors accompanying
this Report. It resembled the fireball of September 14th, 1875, in appearance,
excepting that a decided green hue of the nucleus was observed, and a some-
what more voluminous train of red sparks and fragments appears to have
followed the head. The light which it cast was not so intense as that of the
fireball of September 14, and no sound of a detonation is related to have
been perceived. The radiant-point of this large fireball was near Antares

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

but, owing to its recent appearance, the descriptions of it hitherto collected

   * ' Monthly Notices ' of the Eoyal Astrouomical Society, vol. xxxvi. p. 217. Mr. Daw's
place of observation, given as "Brangling" in that arcnnnt, should have been Branghing,

have not been submitted to exact calculation, although some of those recorded

in the present list are sufficient to determine with considerable accuracy ita

real path.

   From the following descriptions it appears probable that a companion
meteor may also have been visible, corresponding nearly in the time of its

appearance with the principal large fireball which was generally observed.
Mr. John Lane, whose very exact observation of the meteor at Poplar,

--London, is included in the list, remarks : " It appears to me there must

have been two meteors seen near tlie sarne time, one sea-green and very large
[the meteor of 10'' o" p.m., July 2o], the other purple and somewhat smaller.
The clear observation and description given by Mr. H. Pratt from Brighton I

cannot harmonize with my own, while some others agree very well with it.
My results are that it began vertically over a point in W. long. 1°, N. lat.

50° 10', and ended over AV. loug. 2° 15', X. lat. 51° 4-3', at an elevation of
about 34 miles. Distance travelled in relation to the earth 120 miles, in the

orbit of the meteor 170 miles. Actual diameter about 500 yards."
   The following duplicate observation of a shooting-star from the direction

of o Lyrae on the date of this large meteor's aj^pearance was obtained (as the

Committee was informed by Mr. Denning) from a comparison of his own ob-
servations at Bristol with those made by Mr. Clark on that date at Street,

near Glastonbury, about 20 miles south-south-westwards from his point of

observation.

nation, so much like summer lightning that a friend whom I met afterwards
walking in the opposite direction, and who had not seen the star, asked me if

I saw the lightning, when I pointed out what it was, and showed him the

Atail.  similar one appeared in about 10 minutes, but not quite so bright,

taking its course from a little nearer north, and stopping a little nearer south.

Both of these stars were larger and brighter than anj' I ever saw before, and

Athey increased twofold in size and brightness as they went."  sketch is

annexed showing the courses of the meteors Nos. 1 and 2, the first from

about N.E. by N. to S.W. by S., and the second on a course from about

N.N.E. to S.S.W., both tracks extending between points at no very great

altitude and at nearly equal apparent elevations above the horizon in those

directions. It appears probable that both of these large meteors were Per-

seids of considerable brightness, of which the first, however (at about ll*" 23"*,

as observed elsewhere), left the most conspicuous and long-enduring light-

streak on its course.

   Meteor of August loth, 1876, about O*" 30" p.m., Bath (Mr. W. Bush).--
" On the above evening I took a seat in my garden at about O*" 45"° p.m.

at the back of the house, which faces the south-west. I had scarcely been

seated more than a minute, when I beheld an exceedingly brilliant meteor

of a bluish colour, having a very long white train. It was the second largest

meteor I have ever seen. It was at first perceptible to me on the eastern

extremity of Ursa Major, but a little nearer the horizon, I should say at an

apparent altitude of about 45°. It travelled somewhat obliquely downwards

from north-east to south-west, and it finally disappeared behind some houses.

In its transit, which occupied several seconds, it passed behind a cloud,

and emerging from thence was again equally brilliant." [The duration given

is 20 or 30 seconds ; but this cannot be regarded as more than a very rough

estimation of the real duration of the meteor's flight. The point of first

appearance described is between Arcturus and the tail-stars of Ursa Major,
which were on its left, or " eastern extremity " (practically), in the observer's

situation facing the south-west.]

The account of this meteor's appearance by Lieut. H. de H. Haigh at Penn

--Ilthon, JSTewtown, in Wales (other particulars of his description being given

in the above list), was as follows : " At first it appeared larger, but not much
more brilliant, than an ordinary shooting-star ; but it rapidly changed colour

from light yellow to red, and finally to a dazzling white resembling the
magnesium light, but far more intense, at the same time giving off volumes
of smoke, which trailed behind it like the tail of a comet. Its light about
the middle of its course was so brilliant that one could have read by it."

   At Pontardawe, Swansea, it is described as the largest meteor ever seen

in the district, falling in the north, and illuminating the country for miles
around.

   At St. Clear's, near Caermarthen, a splendid meteor, with a light like
that of daylight, moved rapidly "eastward," followed by a train of most

--brilliant hues green, orange, crimson, and violet. It lasted for about eight

-- Aseconds. Mr. J. P. IN'orris, at Bristol, wrote : " splendid meteor has this

moment fallen due west of this house. It first appeared in the neighbour-

hood of Arcturus, then seemed to burst and trail light of rainbow colours,
and was visible nearly to the horizon slanting toivards the north. Its
distance cannot have been great, for we saw it for two thirds of its course

against a dark cloud. It may therefore have fallen in the neighbourhood of

Clevedon."

tion, and the absence of a persistent liglit-streak on its courflo, proves it

not to have been a Perseid, and the radiant was found by Mr. Denning, from

other descriptions of its apparent course, to have been in the constellation

AAquila.     similar optical illusion to that described b}' Mr. Norris, of the

fireball appearing to be projected on a background of dark cloud during a

part of its course, -was noticed by an observer of the largo fireball of Sep-

tember 14th, 1875, at Faringdon, Berks, Mr. AV. Dundas, who writes that " the

sky above was cloudless ; but shortly before I lost sight of it some heavy

clouds low in the sky (and before and after invisible) were brightly displaj'cd

as it passed them. To me it seemed at the time as if the meteor passed

between mo and them, and that the light on them was refiected, not trans-

mitied. Of course, if the meteor was seen also at Bath it could not be so

but it suffered no visible diminution of brilliancy while passing these

clouds " *.

An observer of the same meteor (August 15, 9.30 p.ir.), at Cirencester,

describes it as very magnificent, " passing slowly across the north-western

heavens, about midway between Arcturus and the horizon. The colour was

a vivid pale green ; it left a greenish wake behind it, and burst with brilliant

scintillations of whiter light."

                         II. Large Meteors.

 --1876, June 15, about 8^ 5" or S"* 15" p.m. local time, Suez, and several

stations on the Grand Canal. In the ' Comptes Rendus,' vol. Ixxxiii. p. 28,

a number of accounts from the station-masters at many places on the Suez

Canal, from Suez to Rouville Simsah and Baz-el-beh, are reported by M.

Lesseps of a very large detonating meteor which appeared at the above time.

At the two latter places no sound of a detonation is described ; but the

meteor was extremely bright, bursting at last like a rocket, and moving in

the south-east from west to east. This was also the direction of its motion

at the midway station El-Ferdan, where its hght was dazzling, its dura-

tion was three seconds, and a detonation followed it like distant thunder.
The detonation was most violent at the " deversoir," where the meteor like a

mass of white light moved from south to north, apparently approaching,

and left in the zenith after its disappearance a comet-like cloud of light

visible for several seconds (a perfectly similar appearance of tho meteor was

observed at Barneses). Almost immediately after its disappearance, a noise

like that of thunder and detonations, which were for an instant terrifying,

were heard. At the station of Xabret the meteor, intensely bright and

lasting three seconds, was seen to burst like a rocket, and was immediately

followed by a thunder-like report. At one of the southernmost stations the

meteor seemed to fall in the neighbourhood, descending like a fiery dart,

which burst at last, and sounds like distant cannons followed two minutes

after its disappearance. At Suez the meteor illuminated the horizon bril-

liantly for a few seconds.

   1870, July 8, about 8" 55" p.m. (local time), Indiana, U.S.--The following
letter from Prof. D. Kirkwood appeared in the 'New York Tribune' of

July 19, 1876, describing the appearance of a very brilliant fireball in the

State of Indiana, U.S., on the above date, leaving a streak of light of unusual

duration on its track :

Indiana on -Haturday evening, July 8, about five minutes before 9 o'clock.
Observations of the plienomeuon have been reported from Paoli, Eloomington

--ludianopolis, Elkhart, and various other points the distance apart of the

first and last-named localities being over 270 miles. Mr. J, W. HoUiugs-

Avorth, of Paoli, says, ' Spectators agree in giving it a path from jST.E. to
N.W., with an altitude of at first 20°, and disappearing below the horizon.

One careful observer states that the streak of light following remained visible
more than 40 minutes of time, and all agree in ascribing a diameter of one
fourth to one third of a degree.' At ludianopolis, according to tho ' Daily

Journal ' of July 10, the meteor appeared ' in the constellation Cassiopeia at
a point about 25° above the horizon, whence it proceeded in a right liue to
the north-west, and passed over an arc of about 30°, and vanished in space
10° above the horizon.'

    "According to the observations at Paoli and ludianopolis, the meteor
became visible at an elevation of 130 miles above the earth's surface. It is
to be regretted tliat sufficient data have not been furnished for determining-
its height at disappearance, the length of its visible track, and tho eccentricity

of its orbit."

With the exception of the annual reappearances of the Persci'ds, there have

been no marked occurrences of periodic star-showers during the past year.

The few particulars relating to them wliich have been received will be

described  below                              and  the following details refer chiefly to the display of
                                           ;

JPersei'ds in 1875 observed on the continent, accounts of which in England,

as described in the last Eeport, were obtained at a few stations onlj', owing

to the stormy weather that prevailed on the principal periodic nights.

 Association (' Comptes Pendus,' vol. Ixxsi. p. 439, September Gth, 1875).
 Report on the shower in Switzerland and elsewhere, by Dr. C. Wolf, of
Ziirich. At Eochefort, Messrs. Simon and Courbebaisse counted, on the average
 of the whole time of their combined watch during the nigbt of the 10th of
August, 133 meteors per hour. At Avignon 858 meteors were mapped in the
 same night between tho hours of 8.35 p.m. and 3'' 40" a.m. by M. Giraud,
 assisted by several observers. At Lisbon, M. Capello noted at the Observa-

 tory of 'I'lnfant Don Louis ' what appeared to be a maximum reappearance

 of the shower, 1227 meteors being counted during the v>'atch on the night
 of August 10th. Details of the shower and of the radiant-points distin-
guished in it were also received from M. Tisserand at Toulouse and from the
 Observatory at Marseilles.

    Prof. Tacchini obtained at Palermo a number of distinct centres of radia-
 tion of the shower, of which the following is a list; and he remarks that all
 these definite centres, when projected on a map, are included, as he has
.already formerly observed, in a narrow elongated area.

    At Dijon radiant-positions were also observed by Abbe Lanioy, who noted
the mean place of the principal radiant for all the nights at R.A. 37°, N.

Decl. 45° (A), and recorded also the foUowing general centres of showers

--which appeared to accompany the display : atll.A. 320°-4, S. Decl. 1°'8 (B),

and E.A. 331°, Decl. 0°.

   At Bordeaux, M. Lespianlt noticed the existence of several secondary

radiant-points in or near the constellation Cassiopeia.

    N^otes of an abundant shower were also received from llouen, Sainte
Honorine du Pay, and from Courtcnay, where M. Coruu observed a remark-
able light-cloud, or band of light, stretching with blunted terminations to

a full length of 120°, and moving eastward, which he conjectures may have

had some connexion with the display.

    In addition to these observations collected and published in France under
M. Le Terrier's superintendence, M. Ernest Quetelet communicated to the
Belgian Academy of Sciences * an account of the August meteor observations
made at the Eoyal Observatory at Brussels, and the following numbers of
meteors were observed:

   The largest meteor of the shower, at 11'' 15TM (Brussels time), on the 10th, ex-
ceeded Jupiter in brightness, and left a persistent streak visible for 20 seconds,
which disappeared without presenting any indications of rapid currents in the
upper atmosphere. Although a pretty bright display, this annual return of
the August meteors was yet not so remarkable as to distinguish it as an cscep-

tionall}' great reappearance of the shower.

   At Cheadle, in England t, a very similar view of the shower, confirming
its marked but not very extraordinary intensity, was obtained by Mr. G. T.
Rj^es, whose observations of tlie Persei'ds in 1871, communicated to the
Committee by Mr. Symons, as follows, must have enabled him to make a fair

--comparison between the abundance of the meteors seen on this and on that

earlier occasion : " Took up a station at the top of the Wrekin with a party

of friends for the purpose of observing the periodic display of meteors,

Aug. 10th, 1871. Counted about 70 between 9" 30TM and 11" 30TM p.m., nearly

all in the neighbourhood of the constellations of Perseus and Cepheus ; none

very remarkable. A larger number seen on our way home from ll"" 30TM p.m,

to 2" 15TM A.M., and of larger size, but not coiuited. One very briUiant one [sec
the fireball-list in this Eeport], about 0'' 33TM a.m., lighting up the country."

153 REPORT-- 1876.

  --October, Novemher, and Decemher Star-Showers, 1875. Of the annual

mcteor-sliowers in October and December no observations have been received.
The state of the sky was unfavourable for continued observations on the
periodic dates, and in the intervals of cloudless hours devoted at some sta-
tions to a watch, the preparations for recording the Orionids and Geminids
in 1S75 were unsuccessful, these showers being apparently absent on the
expected dates. At Stouyhurst Observatory a meteor-watch was kept on the
mornings of November 12th and 15th, and also at the Royal Observatory,

Greenwich, on the latter morning, with favourable conditions of the sky, but
in bright moonlight*. In 2| or 3 hours before daybreak on the first
morning eight meteors were mapped at Stonyhurst College, two or three of
which were Leonids, three Taurids, and the rest apparently sporadic.
Twenty-four meteors at Stonyhurst and twenty-six meteors at Greenwich
were mapped in 3| or 4 hours of generally clear sky on the morning of the
15th, of which ten or twelve meteors noted at each place were Leonids, and
the rest were either Taurids or were directed from less certainly determined

radiant-points. On the intervening mornings of the 13th and 14th the sky
was either whoUy or almost entirely overcast.

    The Geminids of December 11-13, 1875, were watched for in England
without success on account of cloudy skies ; and equally unfavourable con-
ditions prevented any satisfactory observations of the meteors of the lst-2nd

of January, 1876, from being made. But the night of January 1st proving
clear at Sunderland, Mr. Backhouse saw two meteors, unconformable, on that
evening-, in a few minutes' watch, and towards five o'clock on the morning of
 the 2nd of January two others in 15 minutes, which were conformable to the

radiant-point of the annual shower. On the following morning also, at about

 2*" A.M., Mr. Backhouse noted one meteor only in a watch of 23 minutes,

when the sky, which had been overcast before, cleared partiaUy, and it was

 conformable to the radiant-point of the shower.

    The following notice of some shooting-stars seen by the expedition under
 Captain Parry in the Arctic seas occurs in the narrative of his third voyage
 (p. 64), relating the events of the winter at Port Bowen in the year 1824,
 and it appears to indicate an appearance of the Geminids with considerable
 brightness in December of that year ; but the description includes meteors
 from other radiants as well as a particularly bright one directed exactly
 from the radiant in Gemini of the annual shower. The changes of the
 weather which accompanied these appearances being regarded by Captain
 Parry as in some intimate manner connected with the apparition of the
 meteors, are described in full detail ; but except to observe that the meteors
 seen appear to have been as exceptionally remarkable as the sudden changes
 of the weather with which they were presumed to be associated, the notable
 features of the wind and weather which are stated in the original account to
 have accompanied them need not here be reproduced at length, but only

 the passages of the narrative may be transcribed in which the apparent paths

 and appearances of the meteors seen Avere recorded with careful accuracy and
 completeness. The particulars of a few meteors thus successfully preserved
 will doubtless be held by navigators and explorers as offering them a use-

 ful example for repeating wherever practicable, and malving known in

 future to the best of their information, such highly valuable observations.

 " The meteors called falling stars were much more frequent during this
 winter than we ever before saw them, and particularly during the month

of December [1824]. On the 8th, at 71" r.Ji., a large auci pretty brilliant

meteor of this kind fell in the S.S.W. On the following day, between

4'' and 5'' p.m., another, very brilliant, was observed in the N., falling from

{in altitude of about 35° till lost behind the land. On the 12th no less

than 5 meteors of this kind were observed in a quarter of an hour ;

the account furnished me by Mr. Eoss, who with Mr. Bell observed the
--phenomena [
was] as follows: At 11" 15TM my attention was

directed by Mr. Bell to some meteors which he had observed, and in less

than a quarter of an hour five were seen. The two first, noticed only by

Mr. Bell, fell in quick succession, probably not more than two minutes apart

the third appeared about eight minutes after these, and exceeded in bril-

liancy any of the surrounding stars. It took a direction from near ft Tauri,^

and passing slowly towards the Pleiades left behind it sparks like the tail of

a rocket, these being visible for a few seconds after the meteor appeared to

burst, which it did close to the Pleiades [the direction of this meteor is

exactly from the radiant-point r Geminorum, close behind it, of the Geminids

of December 12th]. The fourth meteor made its appearance very near the

same place as the last, and about 5"° after it. Taking the course of those seen

by Mr. Bell, it passed to the eastward, and disappeared halfway between

   Tauri and Gemini. The fifth of these meteors was seen to the eastward,

ft

passing through a space of about 5° from north to south, parallel to the

horizon, and moving along the upper part of the cloud haze which still

extended to the altitude of 5° or 6°. It was more dim than the rest, and of

a red colour like Aldebaran. The third of these meteors was the only one

that left a tail behind it as above described. There was a faint appearance

of aurora to the westward, near the horizon." [With the exception of the

third of these five meteors, the radiants from which they were directed arc

undetermined, and appear to have had no connexion with that of the annual

--meteor-shower in Gemini.]
   The April Meteors in 1876. No intimations of the appearance of the

Lyraids on the nights of April 18th-20th, 1876, have reached the Committee,
probably owing to the very unfavourable weather for observation which pre-
vailed. This year being a leap-year, the occurrence of the shower might be
expected to be a day earlier than on ordinary years (April 19th-20th) ; and
the following letter in ' Nature ' (vol. xiv. p. 26) from Professor Kirkwood,
of Bloomington, Ind., probably describes a considerable apparition of these

meteors in the United States on the expected meteoric date.

   "Between 10 and 12 o'clock on the night of April 18th, Mr. W. L.

Taylor, a member of the Junior Class in the State University, with several
other gentlemen, observed an unusual number of shooting-stars. These

gentlemen were returning in an open waggon from EUetsville, eight miles
north of Bloomington. No count was kept of the number of meteors observed,
but the appearance was so frequent as to attract the attention of all the com-
pany. Mr. Taylor thinks the number noticed cannot have been less than

twelve or fifteen. Prom the descriptions given of the meteor-tracks, I find
that they were nearly conformable to the radiant of the Lyraids. The

meteors were remarkably brilliant, apparently equal to stars of the first or

second magnitude. At my request, Mr. Benjamin Vail, a student of the Uni-

versity, made observations on the nights of the 19th and 20th of April.
Both nights were so cloudy, however, that a continuous watch would have
been useless. About 11 o'clock on the night of the 19th three meteors

--were seen in the north-west, where the sky at the time was partially clear."

154 REPORT 1876.

in 1876, has been communicated to the Committee by observers at Birming-

ham, Bristol, Buntingford (Herts), Hawkhurst (Kent), Sunderland, and York;

and the past year's list of meteor observations at the Eadcliffe Observatory,

Oxford, contains very numerous observations on the meteors of the shower.

The state of the sky was generally very favourable for observations (although

the moon had passed its first quarter during the second week in August), and

the number of observations is rather ascribable to this cause than to any

great intensity of the shower which was observed. The maximum hourly

frequency of the meteors noted by one observer at any time during the watch

scarcely exceeded twenty-five or thirty meteors per hour, of which five or sis

were unconformable and the rest Persei'ds ; and the latter were not con-

Aspicuous in brightness or in leaving very persistent streaks.     few large

Persei'ds were recorded, details of the brightest of which (on the 11th at

11" 22"", and on the 13th at 9'' 27'") are included in the descriptions of

large meteors given in the foregoing list. The maximum frequency of the

meteors took place during the night of the 10th to 11th of August, when

one observer might count from 25 to 30 Persei'ds in an hour ; but the number
visible on the nights of the 9th and 11th were much less than this, and not

more than 15 or 20 Persc'ids could be noted in the same time. Their radia-

tion was in general accurate, and the centre of divergence of the recorded

paths was not far from the usual position of the radiant-point of the shower

near rj Persei. The number of unconformable meteors visible during the

period of the annual watch was about 6 or 8 per hour, and more than 60 of

their paths were mapped. The radiant-points which they indicate arc very

numerous, their tracks belonging, with very little apparent ascendancy of

any particular shower, to almost all those known to be in activity during the

time of continuance of the August shower. Several accordances of meteors

simultaneously observed at distant places, besides those of large meteors above

mentioned, are contained in the observations ; and of these and of other points

of special interest in the several descriptions the Committee trust to com-

municate the details, and an account of the results of a complete discussion

which they are at present undergoing, in another year's Report.

The annexed extract from the 'English Mechanic' of September 8, 1876,

contains, besides some observations on the shower, a notice of a lai'ge Perse'id

of which some other exact observations are described (at p. 134) in the general

fireball list of this Rex^ort :

Pbetween 9"^ 15"" and 15", 131 were observed. Of those seen before mid-

night the greater portion appeared to have a radiant-point in Cassiopeia, but

those seen afterwards came from the cluster j^ Persei. Tlio numbers observed
during this month are as follows :

One of the meteors seen on the 13th deserves special mention. It appeared

at about 9'' 27TM, as nearly as I could judge, in semidarkness, moving in a line

from X Persei, and passing with a rapid motion across a small star distant
about 30' (minutes of arc) vertically over B Ursa; Majoris. It was as bright

--as Yenus, and it left a tail for 4 or 5 seconds. J. Pabneli,, Folkestone,"

Special Catalogues and General Comparative Lists of Meteor-Showers.

   As the scattered lists of meteor radiaut-points, or general centres of diver-
gence of sliootiug-st.ars, on ordinary nights of the year are at x)reseut, from
the dispersed materials and limited accessibility of such catalogues, most unser-
viceable for the use of observers, the attempt which has during the past year
been made by Mr. Greg to present a carefully condensed and revised collection
of all such observations in a single comprehensive list will be recognized by
assiduous recorders of shooting-stars as affording them an invaluable fund of

useful information on the previously ascertained positions of all the best

known and best determined radiant-points of such probably distinct showers
or meteor-systems as they may meet with in their observations. With a
view to grouping new observations of the places and durations of shower-apices
under the best-established average dates and directions of the hitherto known
centres of divergence of ordinary shooting-stars, Mr. Greg compiled last year

a valuable condensed list of meteor-showers from all the published catalogues
and observations accessible to him, including all the older and all the most

recently recorded showers of the northern or southern hemispheres visible in

Athe latitude of Greenwich.  single chart illustrating the list was at

the same time drawn by Mr. Greg, and it was the intention of the Com-

mittee to have printed and issued this catalogue and map, together with

an introduction containing directions for their use, in the form of a separate

pamphlet during the past year to assist observers ; but the additional
matter sought to be included with it in the pamphlet being yet unfinished,

and the necessity felt by observers for a full and correct list of the known

average centres of radiation of ordinaiy shooting-stars being one of the

most urgent and important of the requirements which it has been the object
of the Committee during the past year to supply, the course which it has
appeared to them most desirable to adopt (the first stage of the projected
compilation having thus far been completed) is to present Mr. Greg's Cata-

logue and Map (which here follow) in this Report, as a useful companion

to observers for reference aud guidance in recording appearances of meteor-
showers. The reference-numbers of the list coincide with those of Mr. Greg's
earlier list (contained in the volume for 1874 of these Reports), with some

rearrangements and with considerable additions (from the last No., 187, of

the earlier list *) to embrace new showers. By consulting the earlier list,
references more or less complete wiU be found to all the original observations
of these meteor-showers ; and with the assistance of the key-map a ready

and convenient, and for tlie most part perfect, means is thus afforded of de-
termining the degree of importance or the possible distinctness of a newly
observed meteor radiant-point from any previously known observations of

meteor-showers resembling it which may already have been elsewhere

recorded.

                                                   IV. Aekolites.

   Several falls of meteorites (one of them of much importance) have recently

occurred, detailed accounts of which, and of recent researches on aerolites
and on aeroHtic meteors, have been collected during the past year by Dr.
Plight, and form in this Appendix (see Part II.) a continuation of the similar
abstracts contained in last year's Ilepo]-t.

APart I.  Review of recent Stonefalls and of Papers relating to Meteorites.

                 By A. S. Herschei,.

The following falls of meteorites have been placed on record since the date

of the last of those which were there described :^-

-- --A.D. 1814,  Gurramconda, near Chittoor, North Arcot, Madras,

                 India.

,, 187.5, Sept. 1 4, 4'' p.m. Supino, circ. Prosinone, Italy.

,, 1876, Apr. 20, 3" 40"^ p.m. Eowtou, near Wellington, Salop, England

                 (Ironfall).

,, 187G, June 28, ll''-12'' a.m. Stiilldalen, Dalecarlia, Sweden. (See ac-
                                    count of this aerolite at the end of this Appendix.)

   The following descriptions have also been given of meteoric appearances,
presumably aerolitic, of which no further corroborations have hitherto been

received.

    1875, Feb. 10th, Isle d'Oleron, and March 9th, Orleans, France. (See
these Eeports, vol. for 1875, p. 206.) In the French weekly scientific
journal ' Les Mondes,' vol. xxxvi. p. 458 (March 25th, 1875), these meteors
are described as falls of aerolites. It appears probable from this description
that they were detonating fireballs ; but of this, and of their possible aerolitic
characters, no other evidence has been produced of which the Committee has

yet received intelligence.

    The following notice of large meteors seen in America in December and
January last, by Mr. C. W. Irish, of Iowa City, U.S., although affirming them
to have both been of the detonating class, does not distinctly pronounce them
to have been accompanied by falls of aerolites ; but one at least of these fire-
balls produced a very loud explosion. " In the last week (the 27th) of
December, 1875, at 9'' p.m., and also in the first week of January, 1876,. large
meteors traversed the air near the south boundary of this (Iowa) State. One

passed near Ilingold Co., south-easterly ; the other passed over St. Joseph, in
the State of Missouri, travelling eastwards ; and both came to the earth, I
think, very brilliant and noisy. It is stated, in the ' Kansas Chief ' of

December 30th, tliat after a lapse of 2 minutes after the disappearance of
the meteor of the 27th, a sound like the discharge of a heavy cannon was
heard, or rather one loud explosion followed by a lighter one. It jarred houses
and rattled windows."

   From the ' Scientific American ' of August 12th, 1876 (p. 98), Mr. Wood

communicates the following apparently authentic record of a recent fall of an
aerolite in Kentucky, U.S., no meteor, however, being described, and no other

--details of the occurrence having yet been received : ·" The Louisville ' Courier

Journal ' states that on July ISth (1876), at 4'' a.m., Mr.White, watchman of the
Whiteford engine-house, whilst on duty, was startled by a loud report, lilce
that of a pistol, and instantly following some heavy substance fell into the
                                   ;

sh-eet a few feet distant. Mr. "White searched, and found imbedded in the
ground a stone of the appearance of dark flint, weighing about two pounds.
The stone was broken to pieces, and examined during the day by several

scicntifio gentlemen, who pronounced it genuine meteoric substance. The
probable solution is that the explosion occurred at a greater distance than was
supposed, and that this was but a small fragment of a large aerolite."

   To the many valuable essays on the physical characters of aerolites with

which Professor Maskelyne has from time to time enlarged the extent of our
knowledge of the real nature of these bodies, and to the unremitting zeal with

which he has collected in the British Museum a series of authentic specimens
of meteorites not excelled in any other national mineralogical collection, we
owe many of the most interesting discoveries and conclusions of scientific

importance regarding the probable history of meteorites which have been
arrived at in recent yeai's. Some outline of the progress that has been
made in these investigations was given in the concluding paragraphs of last
year's Report ; but a very valuable summary of the existing state of know-
ledge on the composition, structure, and probable history of meteorites has
appeared in a series of papers*, published during the past year by Professor
Maskelyne, entitled " Some Lecture Notes on Meteorites," to which, as they

contain a most instructive review of the many points of information accu-

mulated during a prolonged period of successful and diligent research, the
Committee has especial satisfaction (while noticing in this Report the prin-
cipal contributions to acrolitic science during the past year, notable additions

to which were made in our own country) in being able to refer. These

useful Lecture Notes contain in a few condensed and readily accessible pages
the mature results of almost numberless scattered treatises and memoirs
and besides the certain basis of instruction which they olTer on the ordinary
features of composition , structure, and typical characters of meteorites, and
of the circumstances which attend their fall, a store of useful hints and germs
of fixture theories are thrown out regarding the extra-terrestrial conditions of
rock-formation on distant astronomical bodies from which these strange frag-
ments are derived. In connexion with the discoveries (and especially with
the views advanced by Mr. Lockyer to explain them) of the spectroscope
regarding the selective arrangement and definite elevations of certain ele-
ments forming the ordinary ingredients of terrestrial rocks in the outer layers
of the sun's atmosphere, the low degree of oxidation which invariably cha-
racterizes the constituent minerals of meteorites appears, among the conjec-
tures to which Professor Maskelyne draws attention, no longer to be a singular
peculiarity of the parent bodies from which they were projected, but a condition

of their surfaces which corresponds exactly with the common assumption of

their small dimensions, usually regarded as a necessary supposition to account
for the projection and liberation of aerolites from the attraction of those
distant spheres by forces of ordinary eruptive violence. Such views of the
arrangeinent and concentration of the elements by gravity in condensing cos-
mical masses, tending, in the order of superposition of their densities, to eli-

minate as much oxygen and other light-atomed elements as they contain

towards the surfaces, if, as appears very probable, they should soon be con-
firmed by a more perfectly discriminating scrutiny of the sun's atmosphere
with the spectroscope, will link together more closely than before the evidence
which the spectroscope affords, and which has independently been gathered

from a minute examination of meteorites, that the materials and the laws
of aggregation of the elementary substances constituting the largest and the
smallest suns and planets are essentially the same, only differing very strikingly

from each other in their scale. Conditions which we notice on the sun and
on our own globe we may regard as having in all probability once presided

over the process of condensation of every planet from a state of vapour, and
as having notably collected on the surfaces of the small meteorite-yielding

planetoids, in exact proportion to their size, less oxygen than we find existing
on the surface of the earth. Passing over many valuable pages of descriptive

matter in the ' Notes,' containing exact accounts and appropriate discussions

of many new as well as formerly narrated particulars and observations, it

should be stated that the explanation given in one of the first paragraphs
of the first article in ' Nature ' (loco sk^. cit. p. 487) of the characteristic
pittings of the surfaces of meteoric stones and irons, supposing them to arise
from exfoliation of pieces of the stone or iron by the sudden expansion of the
material produced by heat, is set aside in a later paper by Professor Maskelyne
in favour of a far more natural and more probable hypothesis, the leading
points of which will be presently described.

    The meteoric fall of the greatest interest during the past year was that of
an aerosiderite, or piece of metallic iron, which fell in Shropshire, eight or ten
miles north of the Wrekiu, on the 20th of April, 1876. Rain was falling
heavily, unaccompanied by lightning or thunder, and the skj' was thickly
overcast for some time before and after the hour, 3'' 40" p.m., when the event
took jjlace. At that time a strange rumbling noise was heard, followed by a
startling explosion like a discharge of heavy artillery, audible over an area
several miles in extent among the neighbouring villages of Shropshire. The
meteorite was found about an hour after this occurrence by the tenant of a
grass field, near the town of Wellington, Mr. Brooks, who had occasion to
visit the spot, and observing the ground to have been disturbed, probed the
hole which the meteorite had made, and discovered it at a depth of 18 inches

below the surface. Some men at work at no great distance had heard the

noise of its descent, but without being able to indicate the exact place or its

direction. The hole was nearly perpendicular, the meteorite having entered
the ground almost vertically in a north-west to south-easterly direction, and
Avhen found it was still quite warm. It weighs 7| lbs., and is a mass of
metallic iron irregularly angular, although aU its edges appear to have been
rounded by fiision in its transit through the air, and, except at the jjoint
where it first struck the ground, it is covered with a thin black pellicle of the
magnetic oxide of iron. The surface is somewhat pitted or marked with
slight depressions, one of which occurring in a fiscure of the mass affords some
instructive evidence of the causes of their formation. The exposed metallic
part of the surface exhibits crystalline structure vcrj- clearly when it is etched.
The meteorite was first exhibited publicly at a local bazaar, held in Wolver-
hampton, and afterwards at a meeting of the Natural History Society of Bir-
mingham, by whose representations to the agent of the Duke of Cleveland,
and by the Duke's consent, in whose property it fell, it was presented to the
British Museum. It is only the seventh aerosiderite, or meteoric iron, of
which the fall has been witnessed*, although upwards of a hundred iron
masses have been discovered in different parts of the globe, which are un-

foregoing description of the meteorite, and of the circumstances attending

its fall, are extracted from an account of the occurrence of the aerosiderite by

Professor Maskelync, in ' Nature ' of July 27th, 1876 (vol. xiv. p. 472).

llegarding the origin of tho remarkable pittings of the surfaces of aerolites

and aerosidcrites, an opinion was lately expressed and advocated by Daubree *,

that in their flight through the air they undergo erosion and excavation by joint
effects of fusion and combustion, assisted mainly by air vortices attacking most

violently certain portions of their surface. An important paper on this subject,

by Professor Maskelyne, was published more recently in the ' Philosophical

Magazine ' of August 1876. It is true that pittings identical in appearance

with those of meteorites are found on the surfaces of certain large grains of

powder blown unconsumed from the mouths of tho large modern rifled
ordnance (excellent specimens of this kind received from Professor Abel
and Major Noble having been shown by Professor Maskelyne to Mr.

Daubree in the summer of 1875) ; but two important grounds for exception,

in regard to this explanation, are pointed out by Professor Maskelyne,
which must not be overlooked. The closest examination of the molten

glaze with which, like other parts of their surfaces, the pittings or depres-

sions of meteorites are coated over, shows no indications of vorticose action

of the air, although stream-lines of the glaze from front to rear are of
freqiient and conspicuous occurrence. The process of atmospheric combina-

tion, or combustion, is also rare, if not entirely absent, during the period of

most intense operation of the heat, as is shown by particles of metallic iron

which are occasionally found imbedded in the glaze, and even by cases

where the highly oxidizable mineral Oldhamite (calcium sulphide), occurring

in spherules in the Bustee meteorite, is glazed over equally with the Augite,

without offering any signs of combustion or of the production of cavities

where they are exposed. On the other hand, the readier fusibility of some

constituent minerals of meteorites appears to determine the formation of

depressions of the surface where they present themselves ; and among the

magnesian silicates which form the principal materials of stony meteorites, it

appears that the more ferruginous varieties are somewhat more fusible than

the more purely mngnesiferous silicates, which, with minor assemblages of

other minerals, enter, in very various proportions, into the composition

of the stony masses of aerolites. If the entire process of surface-melting

and abstraction which meteorites undergo is thus correctly represented, the
question of the amoimt of fracture and division into separate parts which they

may suffer by their collision with the atmosphere is one which is yet undecided ;

and many difficulties beset the inquiry if meteorites are single bodies, or if,

as numerous examples appear to testify, they sometimes enter the atmo-

sphere in swarms. An important dissertation on this question by F. Mohr
appeared during the past year in Liebig's ' Annalen'f ; and a paper by Yon

Tschermak (of which a brief abstract was presented in last year's Ilepoi*t),

on the same subject of the probable origin and of the original forms of

aerolites, is now translated in extenso in the Supplementary No. for June

1876 of tho ' Philosophical Magazine.'

   Part II.' Accounts of Aerolites and Aerolitic Meteors, and Abstracts of

                     recent Eesearches on them. By W. FiiaHx.

--1875, Pebruaiy 12th, 10.30 p.m. (Chicago time). Iowa Co., State of Iowa*.

     The conclusions arrived at by Wright, on examining the gases occluded by
 the iron of these meteorites, have been referred to in the Iteport (B.A.) for

 1875, p. 240. He considered that the stony meteorites were distinguished

  from the iron ones by having the oxides of carbon, chiefly the dioxide, as
  their characteristic gases instead of hydrogen. This theory has been called

 in question by Mallet, who refers to his examination of the gases of the iron

  of Augusta Co., Yirginia, where the ratio of the oxides of carbon to hydrogen
 is 4 : 3, and to his having pointed out in 1872 that hydrogen could no longer
  be regarded as the characteristic gaseous ingredient of meteoric iron. In his
  paper of that date he stated that although it might be assumed that carbonic
  oxide would be the original form in which the gaseous carbon-compounds
  existed in the iron, and that it lirokc up at the temperature of the experiment
  into carbon retained by the iron and into carbonic acid, yet in view of the
 steady decrease of the quantity of the latter gas which was evolved as the
  experiment proceeded, it seems more likely that a larger amount of carbon
  originally existed in the higher state of oxidation. Mallet considers that,
 when all the circumstances of the experiment are considered in each case,
  Wright's conclusion cannot be sustained.

     In a paper dated some months later, Wright replies to Mallet's criticism.

 He states that he only meant this expression of opinion to be tentative, Init

  that the results of further work completely justify the conclusion at which

 he had arrived. He has re-examined the gases of the iron of this meteorite,

  and examined those of the iron of some other stony meteorites, such as Ohio,
· Tultusk, Parnallee, and Weston, and finds that not only do the stony mete-

 orites give off a much larger volume of gas at low temperatures, but the

  composition of the gas in all the cases studied is quite different from that

  evolved from meteoric iron. In no case among the results obtained with the
  alloy is the amount of carbonic acid greater than 20 per cent, at 500°, nor

  than 15 per cent, of the A^hole quantity evolved, while in every case but
  one the volume of carbonic oxide is considerably larger. In the chondritic
  meteorites, on the other hand, the percentage of the latter gas is conspicuously
  small, while the carbonic acid constitutes more than half the total gas evolved
  below a red heat, except in the case of the meteorite under consideration

 which fell at Iowa, and here the percentage is not much less, especially if we
  reject the numbers representing the amount obtained by a second and long-
  continued application of a red heat. At a temperature of about 350° it

  constitutes from 80 to 90 per cent, of the gaseous products, and at 90° it
 forms more than 90 per cent, of the gas evolved. The hydrogen, on the
  other hand, progressively increases in quantity with the rise of temperature,
  and is the most important constituent of the first portions removed at a red
 heat. The form in which the carbonic acid is occluded is a problem which
 he cannot at present solve. That it is actually absorbed appears to be certain.

That it has been taken up from tlie atmosphere has been proposed. He finds,

however, that tlie iron of the Iowa meteorite contains no more carbonic acid

now than it did at tlio time of its fall.

Leonard gives a detailed account of the appearance presented by the meteor,

which is stated to have been seen throughout a region 400 miles from S.W.

to N.E., and 250 miles in breadth. The stones vary in weight from a few

ounces to 74 lbs., and the aggregate weight is 500 lbs. ; the area over which

they were scattered appears to be 7 miles in length, and 4 miles at its greatest

Abreadth.     plan of the townships included in this area is given in Leonard's

paper, and it shows where the chief stones fell. By reason' of the frozen

condition of the ground at the time of the fall, and the low angle of descent, it

appears probable that almost all the fragments which fell have been secured.

The velocity of the meteor has not been satisfactorily determined ; it appears
probable that during the last 60 or 70 miles of its course it travelled at the

rate of from 6 to 7 miles per second.

  An interesting pamphlet by Mr. Irish, C.E., deals with the appearance
presented by the meteor. He has incorporated in his paper a number of

letters received from observers stationed over a wide ai'ea, describing their

impressions as to its                      altitude, velocity, and  appearauco                                                             and he has given a
                                                                                                                                        ;

drawing of the meteor, and prepared a map of the district, showing the pro-

jection of its path through the air. I learn by a recent letter from Mr. Irish

that two blocks, one weighing 72 lbs., the other 48 lbs., which evidently

formed one and the same mass which was disrupted during the descent, have

since been found ; and the aggregate weight of the stones now collected cannot
be less than 700 lbs. I am also indebted to Mr. Irish for six excellent

photographs of the Iowa stones, sixty-seven in number, which form the

collections of Prof. Hinrichs, Mr. J. P. Irish, and himself. They were taken

by Mr. Thomas James, of Iowa citj', and are in the very best style of photo-

graphic art.

   Prof. Giimbel, of Munich, lias recently published an interesting paper oii

the characters of this meteorite. He finds the crust to possess a deep bottle-

green or brownish-red colour, and to possess in polarized light all the

characters of an amorphous glass-like mass. "NYhen a fragment is heated it
turns of a dark brown colour, like that noticed by him in the eruptive rocks

of the Fichtelgebirg, and he regards this change as a safe indication of the

presence of olivine.

The silicate decomposed by acid is an olivine, having the formula

which evidently consist of olivine, and some which are opaque and finely
granular. The meteoric iron has a hackly angular structure, and has the
appearance which it would present if reduced to the metallic state in the
position which it at present occupies.

              --1875, December 27th, 9 p.m. Kansas.

    I have to thank Mr. Irish, C.E., of Iowa City, for two cuttings from
newspapers (the Kansas Chief of December 30th, and the Kansas Even-
ing Post of December 29th) recording the fall of a detonating meteor of
the above date. It traversed the heavens in a direction from N.W. to S.E.,
leaving a lurid streak in its wake. The whole heavens were lighted
up, and " made all out of doors almost as light as full moonlight." The
meteor was of the usual Avhitish-red colour, and when it exploded the fiery

,

 fragments were scattered in all directions. " Perhaps two minutes later, and
 after all appearance of the meteor had disappeared, the sound of the explo-
 sion came like the discharge of a heavy cannon ; or rather one loud explosion,
 immediately followed by a lighter one like an echo. The explosion jarred
houses and rattled windows. The size of the meteor and the terrible force

of the explosion may be imagined from the fact that the distance M'as so great

 that it required about two minutes for the sound to reach the earth, and the
concussion was so jilainly felt and heard at that distance. The phenomenon

was witnessed over a large extent of country." An observer, writing from

 Fort Leavenworth, states that it appeared to have its origin in the constel-
lation Cassiopeia, and its course was due east. llr. Irish states that he has

made every effort to secure possession of the meteorites which must have
fallen, b\it has been unsuccessful. The time of flight is estimated to have

been from 12 to 15 seconds.

       --1875, December 27th, 9.20 p.m. State of Missouri, U.S.A.

   I am indebted to Mr. Irish, C.E., of Iowa City, for an interesting description of

this detonating meteor, as well as for a map, on which he has traced its course.
The point where it was first seen in the zenith is at Thayer, in Nebraska,

near the borders of Kansas, and about 120 miles ^. of the Missoiiri river. It

was seen by him at Iowa City first as a small meteor, which rapidly became
brighter, and was hidden from view when at an altitude of about 40° by a
building ; at this moment it gave out a very brilliant quivering flash of light,
which illuminated the whole heavens. It appears from Mr. Irish's map to
have been seen over a wide area, from Stillwater in Minnesota on the north,
to Bufl'alo in Missouri on the south, and as far west as the shores of Lake
Michigan. Near the termination of the flight sounds were heard: over
Archer, in Nebraska, a rushing roaring sound, as of a mighty wind, was
noticed ; at St. Joseph, in Missouri, the first distinct explosion was remarked,
and between that town and Livingstone Co. frequent and very heavy detona-
tions occuiTcd. In the last-mentioned district, and at places as far as 60 miles

distant, numerous red fragments were seen to fall. He says,"I have had several

persons looking for the meteorites where the fall must have taken place ; but
the whole district is covered with dense forest, and is mountainous and broken,
and the ground was very soft from the long-continued rains preceding the
fall, so that no fragments have been found. All the observers of the final
explosion agree that the great bulk of the material M'as thrown upward and
backward upon the course of the meteor, as the arroAV-pointed dots in

my sketch indicate. The luminous appearance continued in sight for

15 minutes."

            OBSERyATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.                        171

            --1876, Januarj' 5th, 10.30 p.m. Iowa and Missouri.

This meteor, according to Mr. Irish's letter and accompanying map, was

witnessed over an area extending from Cass, in Iowa, to Grundy, in Missouri. It

appeared to descend almost perpendic\ilarty, and was a very brilliant meteor,

Aand a very noisy one also.  series of reports twenty-two in number were

heard during its transit from Cass to Grundy. The rumbling thunder of its
artillery, together with its flashes of brilliant light, brought people from their

beds with an apprehension that the great Civil War had broken out afresh. Its

time of flight over the area indicated was not more than five seconds, and the
light it emitted is said to have equalled that of noonday. None of the
meteorites which must have fallen have been found, for the reasons already
referred to when speaking of the detonating meteor of December 27th.

            --1876, January 31st, 5.30 p.m. Louisville, Kentucky.

   Dr. Lawrence Smith, of Louisville, observed a magnificent meteor traversing

the heavens on the afternoon of the above day. He first saw it at an altitude

of about 60° above the horizon, and it disappeared from view behind some

houses at an elevation of about 20°. Its direction appears to have been from

X.W. to (S.E., and the angular magnitude about one sixth that of the disk of

the moon. It was seen over an area 120 miles in diameter. A number of

observers witnessed an explosion which took place when the meteor was

about 10° above the horizon ; all the fragments disappeared instantly, except

the largest, which also became invisible before it reached the horizon. One

or two of the eye-witnesses think they noticed a whizzing noise, and at the

time of bursting heard the explosion. jS^o fragments of a meteorite have yet
been met with ; but it is the opinion of Dr. Smith that they feU about the
range of the Cumberland Mountains in Kentucky, or in the north-east of

Tennessee.

            --1876, April 7th (evening). Eperjes, Hungary*.

  A fireball passed over Eperjes 8° [?£. or W.] from the meridian, and

detonated at an altitude of 38° above the horizon. It exploded with a very

loud noise, and broke into numerous fiery fragments.

--1876, June 28th, 11-12 a.m. StiiUdalen, Dalecarlia, Sweden.

A meteor traversed a part of Central Sweden in a W.N.W. direction, and was

plainly visible in the vei-y bright sunshine. It was observed at Stockholm and

at Sodermanland ; at 13 English miles S.W. of Liukoping it was seen first in

an 'N.W. direction, and at a considerable altitude, and it descended almost to

Athe horizon in the west.  loud whistling noise was heard in the air from

E. to "W., followed by two sharp reports, and others less loud resembling

thunder. The fall of the meteorites was witnessed by eight or ten persona,

and three or four fragments have been secured by Dr. Lindstrom. The

=largest, about the size of two fists, weighs 4^ skalpund [1 lb. av. 1-068 Itt.

or skalpund], StiiUdalen is a station on the Swedish Central Railway, on

the northernmost part of Crebrolan, Some of the meteorites which fell ia

water have been lost.

172 - REPORT--1876.

Rejiort on the Rainfall of the British Isles for the years 1875-76, by

a Committee consisting of C. Brooke, F.R.S. [Chairman) , J. Y.

Bateman,  C.E., F.R.S. ,  Rogers Field,  C.E.,  J.  Glaisher, F.R.S.
                                                                                                                 ,

T. Hawksley, C.E., The Earl of Rosse, F.R.S., J. Smyth, Jun.,

C.E., C. ToMLiNSON, F.R.S., G. J. Symons [Secretanj)

In accordance with the resolution of the Association, the Rainfall Committee,

originally appointed in the year 1865, now present their final report.
   They gave in the report presented at Bristol in 1875 a condensed account

of the contents of their previous reports.

   This year they present the various tables and explanatory remarks upon
them which are necessary to complete the work up to the i)resent time, ex-
cepting that referred to in the 7th following paragraph.

   The tables are as follows, namely :

I. Examination of Eain-Gauges.

II. Eainfall of the years 1874-5.

III. Monthly returns from new Irish stations.

--Examination of Kain-Gavges in situ. Appended to this report are the

results of the examination of 2(j rain-gauges visited since August 1875.

This brings the entire number which have been visited and examined up

to (J55. The Committee regard this as a very important subject, and the

best guarantee of the records furnished by the observers. They have more

than once expressed their conviction that the proper course would have

been to appoint a travelling inspector, so that the whole of the gauges might

be properly examined ; but they have never had adequate funds for the pur-
pose. In fact, the total amount they had been able to devote to it in the 15

years during which the inspections have been going on has only been =£210,

or an average of exactly ,£14 a year. The explanation of the smallness of the

amount in comparison with the work effected (about Gs. 5(7. x^er station visited)

arises from the fact that it has been almost entirely done by our Secretary,

who, as a member of the Association, received nothing for his services but

mcrelj'- repayment of actual expenses, and even these have been materially

--reduced by the hospitality of the observers.
   Ilainfail of the years 1874-5. The usual biennial tables of monthly rain-
fall at selected stations arc appended. Ever since their apjiointment the Com-

mittee have continued these biennial tables, and as IMr. Symons had submit-

ted similar ones for some years previous to their appointment, the entire series

embraces 16 consecutive years. Subject only to changes rendered necessary

by the removal or death of obsei-vers, the same stations have been quoted in

each biennial table, and thus these tables contain about 200 perfect records,

each extending over 16 consecutive j-ears. Only those persons who are aware

of the great importance of continuity in physical researches will fully realize

the value of this series, both for physical and hydrological purposes.

   The Rainfall of 1874 was slightly below the average, owing to a rather
dry spring and exceedingly dry summer. The most remarkable feature of

the year was the heavy fall of rain on October 6th, when the average fall

over England and Wales was slightly above 1 inch in the 24 hours, and the

fall at many stations in North Wales and the Lake District was iipwards of

5 inches. So heavy a fall over so large an area is a very rare occurrence.

The Rainfall of 1875 was greatly above the average in England (especially

Ain the Midland Counties), and irregular in Scotland and Ireland.                                                                                                        very

heavy rainfall occurz-ed in Wales and the southern parts of England on July
              ON THE RAINFALL OF THK BRITISH ISLES.                         173

l-ith ; the fall in 24 hours exceeded 1 inch at 252 stations, 2 inches at 109,

3 inches at 39, 4 inches at 7, and 5 inches at 3 stations.

WeNcv) Irish Stations.--    reported last year the success of our efforts to

improve the geographical distribution of Rainfall Stations in Ireland, showed

that ihe gauges started at the cost of the Association had been supplemented

by many others established at the cost of private individuals, and gave a map

showing the present complete distribution of stations. Almost all the ob-

servers have proved good ones, and, as the table shows, the returns have

been forwarded with regularity. The period is too short to yield precise

results, but a good system has been inaugurated and is in full operation.

At the commencement of this report it was stated that there was one very

important exception to the otherwise satisfactory completion of the work up

to the present time. This exception is the classilied list of stations, and the

results of the " position-returns " which we intended to have incorporated

therewith. In 1865 we published a complete list of every station in the

British Isles at which rainfall observations were known to have been made,
giving the observei-s' names, the height of the stations above mean sea-level,

the epoch of the observations, and various other details. Owing to the large

development of rainfall work during the subsequent 10 years, the list has

become very imperfect, and the Committee have been actively engaged in the

preparation of a revised list. In addition to the details previously given, the

list was also to have contained other most valuable information. The

"position-returns" obtained from the various stations, and which have been

mentioned in previous reports, were to have been summarized, and the results

indicated by symbols affixed to the stations in the classified list, and references

to publications in which the records could be found were also to have been

added. The classified list of stations would thus have formed a complete

catalogue raisonne of all the existing rainfall data, and have given most

useful information at present non-existent. To the great regret of the Com-

mittee, the Association declined to publish the portion of this list presented

last year, and the Committee have therefore felt compelled to relinquish its

completion. They the more deeply regret this, as they consider that the

publication of this list would have been a fitting termination of their work,

and would have redounded to the credit of the Association.

   Notwithstanding the above most important omission, the Committee feel

they have done good service to rainfall work. When they commenced their

labours, the weakest part of rainfall observations was the defective geographi-

cal distribution of the stations. This defect has now been very materially

lessened. By the grants of the Association nearly 250 gauges have been

erected in districts hitherto without observations. The work done in the inspec-

Ation of stations has already been mentioned.  definite unit has been adopted

for the term " rainy day," namely, any day on which one 100th of an inch of

Arain falls.  complete code of rules has been drawn up, so as to secure uni-

formity of practice among observers. The secular variation of the rainfall of

Athe British Isles has been investigated.  determination of the average

proportion of the total yearly rainfall which occurs in each month has

been effected. Elaborate observations have been made and discussed on the

relative quantity of rain indicated by gauges of various sizes and shapes, and

erected at different heights above the ground.

 --To sum up their labours in a sentence, your Committee have aimed they

--hope not without success  primarily  at  obtaining  unimpeachable  records
                                                                                                      ;

and, secondarily, at so discussing and arranging these records as to render

them as useful as possible to physical inquirers and hydraulic engiiieers.

   Lebour, F.G.S., and A. B. Wynne, appointed for the purpose of

    investigating the Rate of Increase of Underground Temperature

   downwards in various Localities of Dry Land and under Water.
   Drawn up by Prof. Everett, Secretary.

A remarkable series of observations have recently been taken in a boring

at Sperenbcrg, near Berlin. The bore was carried to the depth of 4052
Rhenish (or 4172 English) feet, and was entirely in rock-salt, with the excep-
tion of the first 283 feet, which were in gypsum with some anhydrite. Tlie
observations were taken under the direction of Herr Eduard Danker, of
Halle an der Saale, and are described by him in a paper occupying thirty-
two closely printed quarto pages (206-238) of the 'Zeitschrift fiir Berg-,
Hiitten- und Salinen-AVesen ' (xx. Band, 2 and 3 Lieferung : Berliu, 1872),

    The instrument employed for measuring the temperatures was the earth-
thermometer of Magnus, which gives its indications by the overflowing of
mercury, which takes place when the instrument is exposed to a higher tem-
perature than that at which it was set. To take the reading, it is immersed
in water a little colder than the temperature to be measured ; the tempera-
ture of this water is noted by means of a normal thermometer, and at the
same time the number of degrees that are empty in the earth-thermometer is

noted. From these data the maximum temperature to which the instrument

has been exposed can be deduced, subject to a correction for pressure, which
is not very large, because the same pressure acts upon the interior as upon
the exterior of the thermometer.

    In the following resume (as in the original paper) temperatures are ex-

pressed in the Reaumur scale, and depths in Rhenish feet, the Rhenish foot

being 1-029722 English foot.
    Observations were first taken, at intervals not exceeding 100 feet, from the

depth of 100 feet to that of 4042 feet, the temperature observed at the former
depth being 11°, and at the latter 38°-5 ; but all these observations, though
forming in themselves a smooth series, were afterwards rejected, on the
ground that they were vitiated by circulation of water and consequent con-

 vection of heat.

    It has often been supposed that though this source of error maj' affect the
middle and upper parts of a bore, it cannot aflect the bottom ; but the Speren-

berg observations seem to prove that no such exemption exists. When the

bore had attained a depth of nearly 3390 feet, with a diameter of 12 inches
2 lines at the bottom, an advance-bore of only 6 inches diameter was driven

17^ feet further. A thermometer was then lowered halfway down this

advance-bore, and a plug was driven into the mouth of the advance-bore so
as to isolate the water contained in it from the rest of the water above. After
twenty-eight hours the plug was drawn and the thermometer showed a tem-
perature of 36°-6. On the following day the temperature was observed at the
 same depth without a plug, and found to be 33°- 6. Another observation with
 the plug was then taken, the thermometer (a fresh instrument) being left
 twenty-four hours in its position. It registered 36°-5, and again, without
                 --;

                 ON UNDJCRGKOUND TEMPERATURK.                                                                                                                                                                                                          205

pluggiug, it gave on the same day 33°-9. It thus appears that the effect of
convection was to render the temperature in the advance-bore 3° R. too low.

   Apparatus was then employed for isolating any portion of a bore by means
of two plugs at a suitable distance apart, with the thermometer between them.
This operation was found much more difficult than that above described ; but
in several instances it gave results which were deemed quite satisfactory

while in other instances the apparatus broke, or the plugging was found im-
perfect. The deepest of the successful observations by this method was at
2100 feet, and the shallowest was at 700 feet. The first 444 feet of the bore
were lined with iron tubes, between which the water had the opportunity of

circulating even when the innermost tube was plugged ; hence the observations

taken in this part were rejected.

All the successful observations are given in the third column of the follow-

ing Table, subject to a correction for pressure                                                                                                                                                                                          and, for the  sake of showing

   A paper by Prof. Mohr, of Bonn, as represented by an abstract published

in ' Nature ' (vol. xii. p. 545), has attracted attention from the boldness of its
reasoning in reference to the Spcreuberg observations. Prof. Mohr, however,
does not quote the observations themselves, but only the temperatures calcu-
lated by the above formula, which he designates, in his original paper (' Neuea
Jahrbuch fiir Mineralogie,' &c., 1875, Heft 4), " the results deduced from the
observations by the method of least squares." In the abstract in ' Nature
they are simply termed " the results of the thermometric investigation of the
Sperenberg boring," a designation which is still more misleading.

    Attention is called to the circumstance that the successive increments of
temperature for successive equal increments of depth form an exact arith-
metical progression, as if this were a remarkable fact of observation, whereas

it is merely the result of the particular mode of reduction which was adopted,
being a mathematical consequence of the assumed formula

                         =< 7-18 + ax + bx\

The method of least squares is not responsible for this formula, but merely
serves, after this formula has been assumed for convenience, to give the best
values of a and b.

  Herr Dunker, in his own paper, lays no stress upon the formula, and gives
a caution against extending it to depths much greater than those to which

the observations extend. Writing to Prof. Everett under date April, 1876,

he requests that, in the summary of his results to be given in the present

Report, the formula should either be suppressed or accompanied by the state-
ment that its author reserves a different deduction.

   The following are the differences between the temperatures computed by
tlie formula and the observed temperatures :

The necessity of adopting some means to prevent the circulation of water

in bores has for some time been forcing itself upon the attention of your

Committee. Many of the observations taken by their observers have con-

tained such palpable evidence of convection as to render them manifestly

useless for the purpose intended                                                                                                                                       and iu the light of the Sperenberg experi-
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

ments it is difficult to place much reliance on any observations taken in deep

bores without plugging. The selection of a suitable form of plug is now

occupying the careful attention of your Committee.
308 RETORT-- 1870.

   Herr Bunker's paper gives a very full account of the different kinds of plug
employed at Sixrenberg.

   For stopidiig Ihe mouth of the advance-bore the plug had a tapering shape,
and was of hard wood, strengthened by two iron rings, one at each end, and
covered with a layer of tow 5 lines thick, outside of which was thick and
strong linen, nailed above and below to the wood through a leather strap.
It was lowered into its place by means of the iron rods used for boring ; and,
when in position was pressed home by a portion of the weight of the rods.
The plug carried the thermometer suspended from it. Its extraction was
commenced by means of a screw on the beam of the boring-machine, in order
to avoid a sudden jerk, which might have broken the thermometer. The force
which was found necessary for thus starting the plug, as well as the impres-
sion observed upon it when withdrawn, showed that it had fitted tight. To
insure a good fit, the top of the advance-bore had been brought to a suitable
shape, and its inequalities removed, by means of a revolving cutting-tool.
Herr Bunker remarks that this plan is adapted to a soft material like rock-
salt, but that in ordinary hard rock it would be better to make the bottom of
the main bore flat, and to close the advance-bore by an elastic disk pressed
over it. The method of observation by advance-bores can only be employed
during the sinking of the bore, a time when it is difficult to avoid error arising
from the heat generated in boring. The expense of making an advance-
bore at each depth at which an observation is required is also an objection to

its use.

    Another kind of plug devised by Herr Bunker, and largely used in the
observations, consisted of a bag of very stout india-rubber (9 millimetres
thick) tilled with water, and capable of being pressed between two wooden
disks, one above and the other below it, so as to make it bulge out in the

middle and fit tightly against the sides of the bore. On the suggestion of

bore-inspector Zobel, the pressure was applied and removed by means of

screwing. Two steel springs fastened to the upper disk, and appearing, in

Herr Bunker's diagram, very like the two halves of a circular hoop distorted
into an oval by pressing against its waUs, prevented the upper disk from
turning, but offered little resistance to its rising or falling. The lower disk,
on the contrary, was permitted to turn. Both disks were carried by the
iron boring-rods. Eotation of these in one direction screwed the disks
nearer together, and rotation in the other direction brought them further
apart. The india-rubber bag could thus be made to swell out and plug the
bore when it was at the desired depth, and could be reduced to its original
size for raising or lowering. In order to prevent the boring-rods from be-
coming unscrewed one from another, when rotated backwards, it was neces-
sary to fasten them together by clamps, a rather tedious operation in working

at great depths.

    In taking observations at other points than the bottom, two of these plugs
were employed, one above and the other below the thermometer.

    In some of the experiments, the apparatus was modified by using linen
bags filled with wet clay, instead of india-rubber bags filled with water;
and, instead of screwing, direct pressure was employed, the lower disk being
supported by rods extending to the bottom of the bore, while the upper disk
could be made to bear the whole or a portion of the weight of the rods above
it. Some successful observations were obtained with both kinds of bag ; but
the water-bags were preferred, as returning more easily to their original size
when the pressure was removed, and consequently being less liable to injury
in extraction. In some observations since taken in another place (Suden-
berg), Herr Bunker states (in the private letter above referred to) that

                                         J

                    ON UNDKlteilOUND TEMPERATURK.                                                            209

 india-rubber bags, filled with water, and pressed, not by screwing, but b}-

 the weight of the rods, were employed with much satisfaction.
    All the methods of plugging employed by Herr Dunker involved the us*^;

 of the iron rods belonging to the boring-ajiparatus, and therefore would be

 inapplicable (except at great expense) after the operation of boring is finished
 and the apparatus removed.

    It seems desirable to contrive, if possible, some plug that can be let down
 and raised by a wire. In the first report of your Committee, it was suggested
that two bags of sand, one above and the other below the thermometer,
should be used for this purpose. Bags of sand, however, would be liable to
rub ofl:' pieces from the sides of the bore, and thus to become jammed in
drawing up. Mr. Lebour has devised a plug which will be of small diameter
during the processes of lowering and raising, but can be rendered large and
made to fit the bore, when at the proper depth, by letting down upon it a

sliding weight suspended by a second wire. Sir W. Thomson suggests that

a series of india-rubber disks, at a considerable distance apart, will pro-

bably be found efi"ectual.
    Mr. Boot has continued his observations in the bore which he is making

at Swinderby, near Scarle (Lincoln). It has now been carried to the depth

of 2000 feet, and is in earthy limestone or calcareous shale, of Carboniferous
age. Its diameter in the lower part is only 3^ inches. In April last the
temperature 78° F. was observed at 1950 feet ; and more recently 79° F.

--was observed at 2000 feet the water, in each case, having been undisturbed

for a month. Supposing these results not to be vitiated by convection, and

assuming the mean temperature at the surface to be 50°, we have an increase

of 29° in 2000 feet, which is at the rate of 1° in 69 feet.
   Mr. Symons has taken a series of observations at the depth of 1000 feet in

the Kentish-Town well, with the view of determining whether the tempe-
rature changes. The instrument employed is a very large and delicate

Phillips's maximum thermometer. The following is a list of the obser-

--vations :

   The "· depth indicated " is shown by a measuring wheel or pviUey, over-
which the wire runs by which the thermometer is raised and lowered, as
described, with a diagram, in the Eeport for 186t). The above Table shows
that there is always some stretching, real or apparent, in the interval be-
tween lowering the thermometer and raising it again. Hecent observations,
by means of a fixed mai'k on the wire, have shown that the change is not,
in the main, a permanent elongation, but an alternation of length. It is
probably due in part to the greater tension which the wire is iinder in rais-
ing than in lowering, a circumstance wliich will cause a temporary differ-

ence of length variable with the rapidity of winding up ; also in part to the
circumstance that the wire is warmer when it has juet left the water than
when it is about to be let down. Home portion of the irregularity observed

may be due to variations of temperature in that part of the well (210 feet)
which contains air. The observations, taken as a whole, show that any

variations of temperature which occur in this well at the depth of 1000 feet

are so small as to be comparable with the almost inevitable errors of ob-
servation. The observations will be continued at intervals of six months,
with additional precautions, and with an excessively slow (specially con-

structed) non-registering thermometer, in addition to the maximum ther-

mometer hitherto employed.

    Through the kindness of the eminent geologist M. Delesse, of the Ecole
j^ormale at Taris, observations have been obtained from the coal-mines of
Anziu, in the north of Prance. They were taken under the direction of

M. Marsilly, chief engineer of these mines. Maximum thermometers of

the protected Xegretti pattern were inserted in holes bored horizontally to
the depth of -G or -7 of a metre in the sides of shafts which were in pro-

Acess of sinking, and in which there was but little circulation of air.

quarter of an hour was allowed to elapse in each case, after the boring of
the hole, before the thermometer was inserted and the hole plugged. Four
different shafts were tried. Those designated as Nos. I., II., III. were in
the mine C^haband La Tour, and No. TV. was in the mine Eenard.

    In shaft I. observations were taken at eight different depths, commencing

with the temperatiu'c 56|° F. at a depth of 3S-5 metres, and ending with
(171° F. at 200-5 metres.

    In shaft II. there were observations at four depths, commencing with
55° at 87-3 m., and ending with G3j° at 185 m.

    In shaft III. there were observations at three depths, commencing with
5G° at 87-8 m., and ending with 62|° at 144 m.

    These three shafts, all belonging to the same mine, were very wet, and

the temperature of the air in themVas 11° or 12° C. (52° or 54° F.).

    In shaft lY., which was very dry and had an air temperature of about
15° C. (59° F.), observations were taken at six depths, commencing with
70|° F. at 21-2 m., and ending with 84° F. at 134-8 m.

    The mean rates of increase deduced from these observations are:

In Shaft I., 1° F. in 14-4 m., or in 47-2 feet.

    II.,   ,,  11-5 m., ,,  37-7 ,,

,,  III.,  ,,  8-G5m, ,, 28-4 ,,

    IV., ,,    8-57 m., ,, 28-1 ,,

   The observer mentions that in shaft II. there was, at a depth of 90 m., a
seam of coal in which heat was generated by oxidation; but no such
remark is made with respect to any of the other shafts, although it is
obvious that some disturbing cause has rendered the temperature in shaft
IV. abnormally high. Possibly the heat generated in boring the holes for

tbe thermometers in this shaft (which was dry) has vitiated the observations,

the instruments employed being maximum thermometers. Two of the slow

non-registering thermometers mentioned in last year's lleport have been

sent to M. Delesse, to be used for verification.

  --The slow- action thermometers are constructed on the foUo'ndug plan :

The bulb is cylindrical and very strong, and is surrounded by stearine or
tallow, which fills up tlic space between it and a strong glass shield in
which the thermometer is inclosed. The shield is not hermetically sealed

(not being intended for protection against pressure), but is stopped at the
bottom with a cork, so that the thermometer can be taken out and put in
again if desired. Stearine and tallow were selected after trials of several
substances, including paraffin-wax, bces'-wax, glue, plaster of Paris, pounded

glass, and cotton-wool. The thermometers are inclosed in copper cases

lined with india-rubber. When placed, without these cases, in v/ater dif-
fering 10° from their own temperature, they take nearly half ti minute to

alter by one tenth of a degree.
   In concluding this Eeport, your Committee desire to express their regret

at the losses which they have sustained by the deaths of Prof. Phillips, Sir
Charles Lyell, and Col. Strange, of whose valuable services they liavo been

deprived -flithin the last three years.

Nitrous Oxide in the Gaseous and Liquid States.

                 By W. J. Janssen.

[A communication ordered by the General Committ.ee to be printed in e.vlenso.']

The experiments of Faraday on the liquefaction of gases have already proved

that gases at the ordinary conditions of pressure and temperature are vapours

at a remote stage from their points of condensation. If several gases sub-

mitted to great pressure and the cold of the carbonic acid and ether bath

did not exhibit any appearance of liquefaction, the cause is probably that

Faraday did not obtain a temperature low enough to produce liquefaction.

Hence we may conclude that the gaseous and liquid states of matter depend

only on the temperature and pressure to which it is exposed. The interest-

ing experiments of Dr. Andrews with carbonic acid (Philosophical Trans-

actions for 1869) not only verified this conclusion, but gave the important

result that gases and liquids are distant stages of the same condition of

matter, which may pass into one another without breach of continuity. The

temperature at which matter, without sudden change of volume or abrupt

absorption of heat, passes from the ordinary liquid to the ordinary gaseous

state is called by Dr. Andrews the critical point ; above that temperature a

gas never can be liquefied by pressure, it behaves like a permanent gas

below that temperature it will be liquid or gas, or more exactly liquid or

vapour, according to the pressure to which it is exposed. For the details I

refer to the above-mentioned paper.

I have made the same kind of experiments with nitrous oxide, a gas whoso

physical properties agree much Avith those of carbonic acid. The apparatus

was similar to that used by Dr. Andrews, to whom I am much indebted for
the great kindness with which he has afforded me every instruction, and for

his invaluable advice about tlie use of Lis apparatus during my stay at Belfast

and afterwards.

   As my expel imeiits with nitrous oxide presented anomalies which did not

occur with carbonic acid, I first made some experiments with the latter gas,
in order to try whether they were to be ascribed to observational errors or to
the nitrous oxide I used. The results are given in the following Tables,
where S is the fraction representing the ratio of the volume of the air after
and before compression to one another at the temperature i, e the correspond-
ing fraction for the carbonic acid at the temperature t'. and I the number of
volumes which 17,000 volumes of carbonic acid, measured at 0° and 760
millims., would occupy at the temperature and pressure of the observation.
The number 17,000 has been taken as unit to compare thef5e Tables with

those of Andrews.

    Those results agree closely with the experiments of Dr. Andrews at the cor-
respoudiug temperatures, tlie differences being ouly 0*2 of an atmosiihere. At

21°-47 the gas passed into the liquid state at a pressure of GO'S atmospheres,

whilst its volume had diminished from 17,000 to 162 ; with Dr. Andrews
this pressure amounted to GO'05 atmospheres, and the corresponding volume

of the carbonic acid to 160. As the quantity of air in my case was about

^^ of the entire volume of the gas, the increase of pressure to liquefy the

whole after liquefaction had begun, amounted to about 2-4 atmospheres, viz.
from 59'81 to 62-18. The critical temperature I found to be 30°-87. It
wUl be observed that the pressures are those indicated by the apparent con-

traction of the air in the air-tube.

   In the following Tables ^ and e have the same meaning as before, but ap-
plied to nitrous oxide ; I, however, represents the number of volumes which
1000 volumes of nitrous oxide, measured at 0° and 760 millims., would oc-
cupy at the temperature and pressure of the observation. The experiments
were made at the temperatures of 25''-15, 32°-2, 36°-4, 3S°-4, and 43°-8, two
series below, and three above, the critical point, which was found to vary
between 36'^-3 and 36°-7. The appearances were the same as with carbonic

acid.

there remained a certain quantity, about 7/ij to ^^ of the entire volume, or
about 3-5 to 5 per cent.

   This permanent gas cannot be nitric oxide nor oxygen ; for the current of
nitrous oxide being made to pass successively through strong solutions of siU-
phate of iron and of pyrogallate of potassiiim, these solutions did not change

colour.

   The only known permanent gas that could be disengaged is nitrogen. It
is a known fact that nitrate of ammonium, in presence of spongy platinum, is
decomposed at 160° into nitrogen, nitric acid, and water; the same decom-
position of a part of the salt could have been effected by the asperities of the
inner surface of the retort. This quantity of nitrogen would exert a con-
siderable influence on the specific gravity of the gas. The theoretical specific
gravity of pure nitrous oxide is 1-524 ; but being mixed with nitrogen to an
amount of 3-5 to 5 per cent., it should be found much smaller, 1-504 to 1-496

respectively. This result, however, does not accord with actual experiment.

The specific gravity of nitrous oxide, prepared from nitrate of ammonium,
Avas determined according to the method of Bunsen (' Gasom. Methoden,' von
R. Bunsen) ; for that purpose I used a balloon of 200 cubic centims. Four

--experiments gave the following results: 1-531, 1-525, 1-529, and 1-527:

the mean value is 1-528, agreeing verj- well with the theoretical specific

gravity of pure nitrous oxide, but giving a difference of 0-024 to 0-032 from
the specific gravity that would have been found if the gas had been mixed
with nitrogen. These differences are too large to be accounted for by ex-

jierimental errors.

   An analj-sis of nitrous oxide was made according to a somewhat modified

method of Franklaud and Ward. The hydrogen used in these experiments
was obtained from the electrolytic decomposition of water, and the oxygen
was generated by heating mercuric oxide. To ensure that the mercuric
oxide is free from nitrogen, it must be prepared by i)recipitating corrosive
sublimate with caustic potash.

    Three analyses of air gave the following satisfactory results :

46-69=31-12; therefore the amount of hydrogen required to combine with
the oxygen of the nitrous oxide is 146-23-- 31-12=115*11 ; hence the

volume of the oxj'gen contained in the nitrous dxide is equal to ii|-!-=57"5;j,

   Hence we find, on the supposition that the nitrous oxide is pure, the

   But, on the supposition that the nitric oxide is pure, this analysis gives re-

BultB according with my own.

In 100 volumes of nitrous oxide we find-

                By experiment.            Calculated.

      Nitrogen  100-98                       100
                                              50
      Oxygen    49-18

   The general result of these analyses is :

   (1) The volume of the oxygen in the nitrous oxide is smaller than the
volume of the nitrous oxide used by 0-61 to 2-13 per cent.

   (2) The volume of the nitrogen is larger than the volume of the nitrous
oxide used by 0-38 to 1-66 per cent.

   That the volume of the oxygen is smaller than half the volume of the
nitrous oxide used can be explained by the presence of a certain quantity of

nitrogen, ranging from 0-61 to 2-13 per cent., a quantity much smaller than
the total amount of nitrogen mixed with the nitrous oxide, which was found

to be between 3-5 and 5 per cent.

   That the volume of the nitrogen contained in the nitrous oxide is larger
than the volume of the nitrous oxide used could be explained by the presence
of a gas containing more nitrogen in a molecule than nitrous oxide, for in-
stance N3 ; such a gas, however, is not known.

   It will be observed that these analyses do not agree among themselves
very nearly ; and having been prevented from making more experiments, I
will not venture to draw any conclusions from these results, as more analyses
should be made, chiefly because the apparatus with which they were per-
formed was somewhat defective vdth regard to the diameter of the glass

tubing connecting the absorbing with the measuring tube.

   Faraday was the first who observed an anomaly with nitrous oxide ; his
results were very uncertain as to the pressure of its saturated vapour. At a
temperature of 0° F. this pressure amounted to 19-05 atmospheres when

working from lower to higher temperatures ; but after waiting a day he found
24-40 atmospheres, consequently a difterence of 5-35 atmospheres. This dis-
crepancy he ascribed to the gas being a mixture of two different bodies solu-
ble in each other but differing in the elasticity of their vapour.

    Stefan (Sitzungsber. der K. Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Wien, Bd. Ixxii.

1875), in his researches on heat-conduction of gases, also found the nitrous

oxide mixed with another gas. He says, " Von diesem Gase wurde vor dem

Abschlusse der Durchleitung durch den Apparat eine Probe in einer Absorp-
tionsrohr iiber "Wasser aufgefangen. Nach zwei Tagen war das Gas bis auf
cinen etwas iiber 10 Procent des urspriinglichen Volumens betragenden
Biickatand (Stickstoff) verschwunden."

          ON THR TREATMENl! AND UTILIZATION OF SsEWAtJE.

Eighth Report of the Committee on the Treatment and Utilization of
   Sewage, reappointed at Bristol, 1875^ and consisting of Richard

   B. Grantham (Chairman), C.E., F.G.S., Professor A. W. Wil-

    liamson, F.R.S., Dr. Gilbert, F.R.S., Professor Corfield, M.A.,

   M.D., William Hope, V.C, F. J. Bramavell, C.E., F.R.S., and
   J. Wolfe Barry, C.E.

YouE Committee have duriug the past year, ending 24th March, 1S76, been
able to conduct more complete observations at Breton's Farm, near Romford,

and have been also able to test experimentally the value of last year's obser-
vations by having analyses made of samples of sewage and effluent water
kept under various conditions. The expense attending this year's experi-

ments has been generously borne by a Member of the Association.
   From Table I. it appears that the quantity of sewage received from the

town was greater than in any year during the period over which the Com-
mittee's observations extend, not excepting the year 1872-73, when the rain-
fall was larger by 3 inches than this year ; it is therefore clear that the quan-
tity of sewage proper received from the town has increased steadily year by

year, thus :

It should be observed again that, as stated in last year's Report, it has not

been possible during the past two years to gauge the sewage directly in the

--distributing-trough, and so the amount is calculated as follows: the "day"

sewage from gaugings taken in the sewers during the working hours of the

engine, and the "night" sewage from the difference in the contents of the

tanks at the times of stopping and starting the engines night and morning.
   It is worthy of note that while the weekly average of the noonday atmo-

8i)heric temperatures varied from 31° to 79°rahr., the average temperatures
of the sewage only varied from 55° to 70° Fahr.

   Table II, is given again after a lapse of two years, during which it was

impossible for want of funds to have a sufticicnt number of analj'ses made.

REPORT 1876.

   It appears that during the months of June, July, August, and September
little or no nitrogen as nitrates or nitrites was found in the effluent water
and from this it might hastily he concluded th'at for some reason or another
the usual amount of oxidation had not gone on in the soil ; hut the fact turns
out to he that ozahc acid had been added to the samples (both sewage and
effluent water) of these months with the view of preyenting oxidation going
on in them during and after collection, and this prevented the estimation of
nitrogen in these forms by the process used.

 --To test this some experiments were made as follows : The October efflu-

ents, to which no oxalic acid had been added, gave 0*49 of nitrogen as nitrates
or nitrites per 100,000 parts ; to 500 cubic centimetres of this effluent 0-5
grain of oxalic acid was added, and the mixture allowed to stand for five
days ; no nitrites could then be discovered in it. Again, the effluent water col-

--lected at Breton's during June 1876 was examined as follows : " One portion

of it was analyzed, taking the sample from the full bottle ; at the same time
another portion was poured ofi' into a bottle, filling this bottle quite full, and
to this portion 18 grains of solid oxalic acid was added and this allowed to
stand for seven clear days, then analyzed. It was kept in a cool cellar. The
18 grains of oxalic acid to the quantity taken is in the proportion of 2 oz. to

the carboy of 12 gallons.

   It is remarkable how little the true average composition of the sewage

differs from the results obtained in previous years ; and the Committee con-

sider that this circumstance affords considerable proof of the accuracy of their

methods of sampling, the principle of which has always been that the samples
should be taken in proportion to the amount of flow at the time ; thus the
amount of nitrogen in parts per 100,000 in the sewage has been, according

:--to the calculations from the results of the gaugings and analyses, as follows

   This shows that the total amount of nitrogen in the solid mutt«r contained
in a sample of sewage or of effluent water is not altered by keeping, provided
the bottle be well filled. It is worthy of 'note that the nitrogen in the
effluent water was almost all converted into nitrates*.

    In order to ascertain the effect of keeping sewage in unfilled bottles, the
following experiments were made. The remnants of the January sewage
and effluent water, which had been left in the bottles, were analyzed again

--on July loth, 1876, and the sewage again on July 31st, and the following

results obtained:

amount than last year ; this is equivalent to SO'Si per cent, of that received

in the sewage.

    The Table shows that 139 lbs. of nitrogen were recovered per acre over the

 aggregate acreage under crop during the year, viz. 147-87 acres ; it will,
however, be more correct and of greater practical utility to show the amount
of nitrogen recovered in the crops per acre of the fai'm under crop, viz.
108-44 acres, during the past five years.

    In the following Table the amount of nitrogen applied to the farm in the
Bewage and that recovered in the crops is shown for each of the last five
 years ; and it appears that the amount of nitrogen recovered in the crops
during the whole period is equal to 32-88 per cent, of the amount applied in
the sewage, and that the amount recovered per acre of the farm under crop
averaged 182 lbs.

  Improved Investigations on the Flow of Water through Orifices, with

      Objections to the modes of treatment commonly adopted. By Prof.
      James Thomson, LL.D., D.Sc.

      [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso among

                                                                           the Keports.]

  The methods usually put forw^ard for treating of the flow of water out of
  vessels b}- orifices in thin plates, slightly varied though they may be in different

  cases, are ordinarily founded on assumptions largely alike in these different
  cases, and largel}' erroneous. The theoretical views so arrived at, and very
  generally promulgated, are in reality only utterly false theories based on sup-
  positions of the flow of the water taking place in ways which are kinemati-
  caU}' and dynamically impossible, and are at variance with observed facts of
  the flow, and even at variance with the facts as put forward by the advancers
 themselves of those theories. The admittedly erroneous results brought out
 through those fallacious " theories," and commonly miscalled " theoretical
 results," are afterwards considerably amended by the introduction into the
  formulas so obtained of constant or variable coefficients, or otherwise, so as
 to be brought into some tolerable agreement with experimental results.
 These means of practical amendment, however, being themselves not estab-
 lished on any scientific principles, can at best only conduce to the attainment
 of useful empirical formulas, but cannot, by their application to the orio-i-

 AnaUy false theoretical views, come to develop any true scientific theory.

 theory may, no doubt, be regarded as a good scientific theory, and as bein»
 good for practical purposes, which leaves out of account some minor features
 or conditions of the actual facts. In so far as it leaves any influential
 elements out of account, it is imperfect ; but if the conditions which, for
 simplicity, or from want of complete knowledge of the subject, or for any
 other reason, are left out be of very slight influence on the practical results

in question, the theory may be regarded as a very good one, though not quite
perfect. In the case, however, of the hydraulic theories now referred to, the
false principles involved in the reasonings relate to the main and important

 conditions of the flow, and not to anj' mere minor considerations, the imper-
fections or errors of which might be of but slight importance in the develop-
ment of the main principles involved, and but little influential on the results
sought to be attained.

   I will now proceed to give some examples or sketches of the usual

methods of treating the subject.

    I will first take the case of water flowing from a state of rest through an
oiifice in a vertical plane face. This case is ordinarily treated bj' supposing
the orifice to be divided into an infinite number of infinitely narrow horizontal
bands of area, and supposing the velocity of the water in each l)and to be
that due, through the action of gravity, to a fall from the still-water smi'ace-
level down to that band ; then multiplying that velocity by the area of the
band, and treating the product as being the volume flowing per unit of time
across that horizontal band or element of the area ; and integrating to find
the sum of all these volumes of water for all the bands, and treating this
sum as being the " theoretical" volume per unit of time flowing across the
whole area of the orifice. This result is commonly called the " theoretical

discharge " per unit of time ; but, as it is known not to be the actual dis-
charge, it is then multiplied by a numerical coefficient called by some " the

                                                                          r2

coefficient of contraction.'' and by others the " coefficient of cKscharf/e," in order
to find the actual discharge per unit of time.

    Th\i.s for the case of a rectangular orifice in a vertical plane face, as in

-- A DLfig. 1 where AY is the level of the still-water surface, and B C is the

                  Fijr. 1.  Fig. 2.

 the same dii'ectiou at diiferent parts ; and the assumption of the velocity
 being the same throughout, together with the assumption tacitly implied of
 the direction of the motion being the same throughout, vitiates the reasoning
 very importantly. It is thus to be noticed at the outset that the division of
 the orifice into bands, infinitely narrow iu height, but extending horizontally
 across the entire orifice, cannot lead to a satisfactory process of reasoning, and
 that the elements of the area to be separately considered ought to be infinitely
 small both in length and in breadth.

     iiecondli/. For anj' element of the area of the orifice infinitely small in
 length and breadth it is not the velocity of the water at it that ought to be
 multiplied by the area of the element to find the volume flowing per imit of
 time across that element, but it is only that velocity's component which is
 normal to the plane of the element that ought to be so multiplied.

    Thirdly. Whether, for any element of the area of the orifice, we wish to treat

 of the absolute velocity of the water there, or to treat of the component of that
 velocity normal to the plane of the orifice, it is a great mistake to suppose
 that the velocity at the element is that due by gravity to a fall from the still-

 water surface-level of the pent-up statical water down to the element. The

 water throughout the area of any closed orifice in a plane surface, with the
 exception of that flowing in the elements situated immediately along the
boundary of the orifice, has more than atmospheric pressure ; and hence it can
be proved * that it must have less velocity than that due to the fall from the

still-water surface-level down to the element.
    The foregoing may be illustrated by consideration of the very simple case

of water flowing from a vessel through a rectangular orifice in a vertical
plane face, two sides of the rectangle being level, and the other two vertical,
and end contractions being prevented by the insertion of two parallel guide
walls or plane faces, one at each end of the orifice, and both extending some
distance into the vessel perpendicularly to the plane of the orifice, so that

the jet of issuing water may be regarded as if it were a portion of the flow

through an orifice infinitely long in its horizontal dimensions.

   Thus if the jet shown in section in fig. 3a be of the kind here referred to,

Wwhile L is the still- water surface-level, the so-called " theoretical velocities"

at the various depths in the orifice, which are dealt with as if they were in
directions normal to the plane of the orifice, can be, and very commonly are,

Drepresented by the ordinates of a parabola as is shown in fig. 36, where B

level of the point in the orifice to which the ordinate belongs. Then, under
the same mode of thought, or same set of assumptions, the area of that

parabola between the upper and lower ordinates (B D and C E) will represent

what is commonly taken as the " theoretical discharge " per unit of time
through a unit of horizontal length of the orifice. But this gives an exces-

sively untrue representation of the actual conditions of the flow. Instead of
the parabola, some other curve, very different, such as the inner curve

sketched in the same diagram, fig. 3h, but whose exact form is unknown,
would, bj- its ordinates, represent the velocity-components normal to the
plane of the orifice for the various levels in the orifice, and its area would
represent the real discharge in units of volume per unit of time through

a unit ol liorizontal length of the orifice. Although the exact form of this

true curve is untnown, yet we maj' observe that it must have its ordinates
each less than the ordinate for the same level in the parabola.

   The truth of this may be perceived through considerations such as the

following. First, it is to be noticed that for the very top and the very bottom

D EBof the orifice, instead of the ordinates and C of the parabola, the ordi-

nates of the true curve must be each zero ; because, at each of these two

places, the direction of the motion is necessarily'tangential to the plane of the
orifice *, and so the velocity-component normal to the plane of the orifice

* The assertion here made, to the efTect that the directions of the stream-lines which

form the external surface of the jet on its leaving the edge of the orifice must, at the edge,

be tangential to the plane of the orifice when the orifice is in a plane face, or must in

general be tangential to the marginal narrow band or terminal lip of the internal or water-

confining face of the plate or nozzle in which the orifice is formed, can be clearly and easily

proved, although, strangely, the fact has been and is still very commonly overlooked.

Even MM. Poucelet and Lesbros, in their delineations of the forms of veins of water

issuing i'rom orifices in thin plates, after elaborate observations and measurements of those

forms, represent the surface of the issuing fluid as making a sharp angle with the plane

wetted face in leaving the edge ("Experiences Hydrauliques sur les Lois de I'Ecoule-

ment de I'Eau," a Memoir read at the Academy of Sciences in November 1829, and pub-

lished in the Memoires, Sciences Mathematiques et Physiques, tome iii.). Other writers

on Hydraulics put forward very commonly representations likewise erroneous. Weisbach,

for instance, in his valuable works (Ingenieur ur.d Maschinen-Mechanik, vol. i. § 313, fig.

427,  date  1846                         and Lehrbucli der  theoretischen               Mechanik,  5th ed.  date 1875,  edited  by

Hermann, § 433, fig. 772), has assumed (not casually, but with deliberate care, and after

experimenial measurements made by himself), as the best representation which, with avail-

able knowledge of the laws of contraction of jets of water, can be given for the form of the

must be zero ; and that component, not the velocity itself, is what the
ordinate of the true curve must represent. On the hj'pothesis of perfect

fluidity in the water (which, throughout the present discussions and investi-

gations, is assumed as being a close enough representation of the truth to

form a basis for very good theoretical views), the velocities at top and bottom

of the orifice will be those due by gravity to falls from the still- water surface-
level down to the top and bottom of the orifice respectively, because at these

places the water issues really into contact with the atmosphere, and

consequently attains atmospheric pressure. At all intervening points in the

plane of the orifice it maj' readily be seen, or may with great confidence be

admitted, that the pressure will be in excess of the atmospheric pres-

sure                   because, neglecting for simplicity the slight and,  for  the  present
                    ;

purpose, unimportant modification of the courses of the stream-lines caused by

the force of gravity acting directly on the particles composing the stream-

lines, as compared with the courses which the stream-lines would take if the

action of gravity were removed, and the water were pressed through the

orifice merely by pressure applied, as by a piston or otherwise, to the fluid

in the vessel, we may say, truly enough for the present purpose, that an

excess of pressure at the convex side of any stream -line is required in order
that the water in the stream-line can be made to take its cui-ved path. The

mode of reasoning on this point suggested here may be obvious enough,

although, for the sake of brevity, it is here not completely expressed. It fol-

lows that at all these intervening points in the plane of the orifice the absolute

velocity of the water will be less than that due to a fall from the still-water

surface down to the level of the point in the orifice ; and besides, at aU depths

in the plane of the orifice except a single medial one, the direction of the

flow will be oblique, not normal, to the plane of the orifice. Hence,

further, through these two circumstances, jointly or separately as the case may

be, it follows obviously that the ordinates of the true curve will everjTvhere

be less than those of the parabola.

Fig. 4 illustrates in like manner the false theoretical and the true actual

conditions of the flow over a level upper edge of a vertical plane face, which

may be exemplified by the case of a rectangular notch without end contrac-

tions, or of a portion of the flow not extending to either end in a very wide

rectangular notch. In this case it is to be observed that the ordinates at

and near the top of the issuing Avater in the vertical plane of the orifice

--must be only slightly less than those of the parabola because, at the very

top or outside of the stream, atmospheric pressure is maintained throughout

the length of any stream-line, and so the velocity will be very exactly that

due by gravity to the vertical depth of the flowing particle below the still-

water surface-level in the vessel ; and because, also, the direction of the

contracting vein of water issuing from a circular orifice in a thin plate, a solid of revolu-
tion specilied clearly in such a way that the water surface in leaving the plane of the plate
makes an angle of about 67° with that plane, and states to the effect that that water sur-

face is just a continuation of the paths of the stream-lines within the vessel which he
represents at the margin of the orifice as crossing the plane of the orifice with conrerging

paths making the angle already mentioned of about ti7° with that jslane. They ought in
reality to leave the lip tangentially to the plane, and then to make a very rapid turn in a
short space (or to have a very small radius of curvature) on just leaving the lip of the
oiiflce. The prevalence of erroneous representations and notions on this subject was
adverted to, and an amendment was adduced, by myself in a Report to the British Asso-
ciation in 1861 on the Gauging of Water by V-Notches (Brit. Assoc. Rep. Manchester

Meeting, 1861, part 1, p. 156).
248                                                             REPORT 1876.                                              ;

motion does not deviate mucli from perpendicularity to the plane of the

orifice. Lower down in the plane of the orifice the direction of the
water's motion will approach still more nearly to being perpendicular to

that plane                                                 bnt there the pressure  will be considerably in excess of the

atmospheric pressure, and so the velocity will be considerably less than that

due by gravity to a fall through the vertical distance from the still-water

surface-level down to the stream-line in the plane of the orifice. At places

still further down in the orifice the flow comes to be obliquely upwards

and this obliquity is so great as to render the normal component very

much less than the actual velocity, while the actual velocity itself is

less than that due by gravity to the depth of the particle below the still-
water surface-level. At this region of the flow then, for both reasons, the

ordinates of the time curve are less than those of the parabola. Lastly, at

the very bottom of the orifice, or immediately over the top of the crest of

the notch, the water issues into contact with the atmosphere, and so attains
to atmospheric pressure, and must therefore have the velocity due by gravity

to its depth below the still-water surface-level. Here, however, its direction

of flow is necessarily tangential to the plane face of the vessel from which
it is shooting away, and consequently is vertically upwards. Hence the

normal component of its motion is zero, and so the ordinate of the true

curve at that place is zero in length, instead of the normal component

being greater at the bottom of the orifice than at any higher level, and

instead of that component being properly represented by the ordinate there

of the parabola.

Like explanations to those already given might be offered for other forms

of orifices (for circular or triangular orifices or V-notches, and for orifices

in general which may be in vertical or horizontal or inclined plane faces,

or in faces of other superficial forms than the plane), and it might be
shown that in general the ordinary modes of treating the subject are very

faulty.

   The examples already discussed may suffice to direct attention to the

faulty character of the ordinarilj^ advanced theories, and to give some sug-
gestions of directions in which reforms are requisite.

   I will now proceed to offer some improved investigations which are appli-

cable to many of the most ordinary and most useful cases iu practical

hydraulics, in reference to the flow of water through orifices in thin plates,
or from the wetted internal surface of vessels terminating abruptly in
orifices. In devising and arranging these investigations I have aimed at

putting them in such form as that they may be intelligible and completely

demonstrative to students even in the early stages of their progress in

--d3'namical studies.
   Definition. The free level for any particle of water in a mass of statical
or of flowing water is the level of the atmosphei-ic end of a column, or
of any bar straight or curved, of particles of statical water, having one end
situated at the level of tlie particle, and having at that end the same pres-
sure as the particle has, and having the other end consisting of a level
siirface of water freely exposed to the atmosphere, or else having other-
wise atmospheric pressure there ; or briefly we may say that the free level
for any particle of water is the level of the atmospheric end of its pressure-
column, or of an equivalent ideal pressure-column.

  --Theorem I. In the case of steady flow from approximate rest of water

or any liquid considered as frictionless and incompressible, the velocity of any
particle in the stream is equal to the velocity which a body would receive in
falling freely from rest through a vertical space equal to the fall of free level
tvhich is incurred by the pirticle in the stream dunng its flow from rest to its

 existing p)Osition.

   Or, in briefer words sufficiently suggestive, it may be said that, in respect

to water or any liquid flowing so as to admit of its being regarded as truly
enough frictionless and incompressible. In steady jhw, the velocity generated
from, rest is that due by gravity to the fall of fre.' level.

    Or if 'Q be the fall of free-level sustained by any particle in passing from
a statical region of the mass of water to a point in the region of flow, and
if V be the velocity of the particle when at that point, then

   * The units of force derivable by the method of Gauss from the various units of
length, mass, and time, in common use, though spoken of imder general designations such

as "absolute tmits of force" or "kinetic units of force," have until lately been individually
anonymous: and this deficiency, notwithstanding the important scientific and practical
uses which these units were capable of serving, has been a great hindrance and discou-
ragement to their general employment in dynamical investigations, aud even to any satis-
factory spread of knowledge of their meaning. Three years ago, the British- Association
Committee on Dynamical and Electrical Units (Brit. Assoc. Report, 1873, part I, p. 222),
taking the centimetre, the gram, and the second as units of length, mass, and time,

named the force so derived tlie Dyne. For the unit of force derived from the foot,
the pound, and the second, the name Powndal has been introduced by myself ; and it
seems likely to come into use. At this Meeting of the British Association I have proposed
the Crinal and the Funal as names for the two imits of force derived respectively, one
from the decimetre, the kilogram, and the second, and the other from the metre, the

Atonne, and the second (see Proceedings of Section in the present volume). The

familiarization of these important units to the minds of students of dynamics will,

in a very important degree, aid the acquisition of clear and true views in hydrokinetics,

as also in dynamics generally.

initial interface at B, is

or that work is        = gp\.c;

                       =gm\,

since pc=m.

   Again, during the emergence of the mass past the interface at U, it gives
away to the water in front of it a quantity of work which, in like manner, is

                                     =p . c

  Also during the passage of the particle from its first place at B to its place

U =at it descends a vertical space /; hence during that passage it receives
=from gravity a quantity of work gmf.

   On the whole the mass receives an excess of work beyond what it gives,

and that excess of work received is

the flowing of water, from the comUtioii of approximate rest, through orifices
similar in form and similarly situated relatively to the still-ivater surface-
level* , the stream-lines in the different flows are similar in form: also the
velocity of the water at homologoiis places is proportional to the square root of
any homologous linear dimension in the different flows : and also (2iressures
henig reckoned from the atmospheric pressure as zero) the pressure of the water
on homologous small interfaces in the different flows is proportional to the cube of
any homologous linear dimension; or, in other words, the fluid pressure (super-
atmospheric), per unit of area at homologous places, is proportional to any

homologous linear dimension.
    Preparatively for the demonstration of this theorem, it is convenient to

establish some dynamic principles, which, for present purposes, may he

regarded as lemmas or preparatory pro])03itions, and which will be grouped
here together under the single heading of Proposition A.

homologous linear dimension, and the pressure of the ivater at homologous

places on homologous areas ivill be proportional to the cube of the homologous

linear dimension ; and the ivater will press, at homologous places, on homo-

logous areas of the septums, tvith a force on one side in excess of that on the

--other, which tvill he proportiorud. to the cube of the homologouslinear dimension.
   Note. For brevity in what follows, pressures at homologous places on

homologous areas will be called homologous pressures, and pressures per unit

of area will be called unital pressures ; and any difference of the fluid pres-

sures on the opposite sides of any small portion or element of a septum will

be called a differential pressure.

The demonstration of the proposition will be aided bj fii'st noticing the

following relation in respect to two small solid masses in motion. It' two

msimilar small solid bodies of masses and m', having their homologous linear

dimensions as 1 to n, are guided to move along similar curves, having likewise

their homologous linear dimensions as 1 to n (fig. 6), and if the velocities of

Vnthe bodies at homologous points in their paths be as 1 to                                                   , then

* The English form for the plural of septum, when septum is used as an English word,

is here purposely preferred to the Latin sepfa.

t The name " centrifugal force" is here adopted in the sense in which it is commonly

used. I fully agree with the opinion now sometimes strongly urged to the effect that

--this name is not a very happily chosen one ; for two reasons : first, because the name

centrifugal would be better applied to a moticm of flying from the centre, than to a force

acting outwards along the  radius                                     and  secondly, because the          body really receives  no  out-
                                                                   ;

ward force, no force in the direction from the centre, but receives a centreward force which,

being unbalanced, acts against the inertia of the body, and diverts the body from the straight

line of its instantaneous motion. The centreward force actually received by the body, and

which is the force acting on it normal to its path, maybe called the devia five force received

by the body. This is equal and opposite to the outward force called "centrifugal force"

which is not received by the body, but is exerted outwards by it against whatever is

compelling it to deviate from the straight line of its instantaneous motion. The name

"centrifugal force," however, although objected to, is in too general use tlu-oughout the

world to allow of its immediate abandonment.

Hence the centrifugul forces are

          as                               nr

   This being understood, it readily becomes evident that if, instead of small

solid masses sliding along guides, we have two small homologous masses of

mwater and m, fig. 7, flowing in similar slender guide-tubes, and if homo-

logons pressures be applied to the two masses in front and behind which
are as 1 ton', and i^at homologous situations in their two paths their
velocities be as 1 to Vn, then, in respect to all the forces received by the two
masses from without, other than those applied by the guide-tubes, and also
in respect to the forces required to be received for counteracting their centri-
fugal forces, we see that aU these constitute force systems similar ^^
arrangement and of amounts as 1 to n\ It therefore follows that the
forces which the masses must receive from their guide-tubes must be similarly
arranged and of amounts, on homologous small areas, as 1 to n\

bounding interfaces, each separating the region of flow with important energy

    Let the pressure at B, the beginning of the tube, on the initial interface,

outside of which the water may be regarded as statical, or as having no

important energy of motion, be denoted by hi, ; or, what comes to the same
thing, let the depth from the stUl-water surface-level down to the beginning

of the tube at B be denoted by hb, as is marked in the figure. It is thus to

be noticed that the fall of free level incurred by a particle in flowing along

Uthe guide-tube from B to is the vertical distance from the stiU-water sur-

Wface-level, L, down to T, the top of the pressure-column for the flowing

water at U. This fall of free level may be denoted (in conformity with the

notation in Theorem I.) by C-

--hi) h=k. Thus in case of an increase of pressure-height in any guide-tube,
Ufrom its beginning to any point in its course, Jc will be negative.

    Por No. 2, let the same letters of reference to the diagram, and the same

notation, be used as for No. 1, with the modification for No. 2 merely of the

attachment of an accent to each letter.

   Now as a part of the data on which the present investigation under Pro-
Aposition is founded, it is to be assumed that a unital pressure is somehow

maintained at E', the end of the guide-tube in No. 2, n times that which is

anyhow maintained at the corresponding point E in No. 1. Thus, if we
denote these two pressures expressed as pressure-heights, at E and E' respec-

tively, by he and (he)', we have (Jie)' ^nhe ; and hence the fall of free level

from beginning to end in No. 2 is n times the fall of free level from beginning

to end in No. 1.

  EHence putting v, and {v^)' to denote the velocities at and E' respectively,

we have (by Theorem 1., which proves that the velocities must be proportional

to the square roots of the falls of free level)

   Again, from similarity of forms, we have iu respect to areas of cross-

sections of the two guide-tubes :

                            Earea at  area at E'

                            Uarea at  area at U'

or since reciprocals of equals are equal :

This applies to any or all homologous points in the two regions of flow.

   Now by referring to the figure or otherwise, it will readily be seen tliat
--I, or the fall of free level from B to U, is =li^-\-f--h, while ic=:\ h; and

that therefore ^=f-\-'k. Hence, by Theorem I., we have

                            v= ^2g(f+Jc).

In like manner in No. 2 :

Hence, subtracting equals from equals, we have        (3)

but by similarity of forms  {h^)'=nhi                 (4)

Also, since the pressure at any point in a stream-line, or guide-tube, is its

initial pressure minus the relief of pressure, we have

                            h^-h=h                    (5)

Prom this last by (4) and (3) we get

                         =nhi,--nk h', or n(hi--k)=h'

whence by (5)  h' = nh                                    (7)

From this, if we put P and P' to denote total pressures on homologous small

Uareas at and U', it foUows that

               P'=»T                                      (8)

This holds good for any homologous places in any homologous guide-tubes,

and so it holds for immediately adjacent places in any two contiguous guide-
tubes. Hence, in respect to any small element of the septum between two
adjacent guided stream-filaments in Flow No. 1, considered comparatively
with a homologous element of a septum in Flow No. 2, the homologous dif-
ferential pressures in No. 1 and No. 2 wiU be as 1 to n^

   Thus the demonstration is now completed of aU that is included in Pro-

Aposition ; and we are ready to go forward to the demonstration of Theorem
II. for which Proposition A was meant to be preparative. For this we have
Ato observe that the conclusions arrived at in Proposition hold good, no

matter what may ba the forms of the guide-tubes, provided that they be
similar in both flows ; and no matter what may be the distribution of

pressures throughout a terminal interface crossing the assemblage of guide-

tubes in No. 1, provided that the homologous pressures throughout a
homologous terminal interface in No. 2 be anyhow maintained severally n^
times those in No. 1. Hence, if in Flow No. 1 the guide-tubes be formed so
 that the water shall flow along exactly the same paths as if it were left
 unguidcd, and were left free to shoot away, past the interface at E, to a

 distance from the orifice great in proportion to the thickness of the issuing

--stream, without meeting any obstniction and if the guide-tubes in No. 2 be
--similar to them and if in No. 1 the system of pressures distributed through-

out the terminal interface at E be made exactly the same as if the water

--were flowing freely for a great distance past that terminal intei-face and if

 in No. 2 the system of homologous distributed pressures throughout a homo-

--logous terminal interface at E' be anyhow maintained severally n^ times those

 in No. 1, it foUows that the diff'erential pressure on the two sides of any
 element of a septum in Flow No. 1 will be zero, as the guide-tubes have
 there no duty to perform. Then, on the homologous septum element in
 No. 2, the differential pressure, being n' times that in No. 1, will be zero
 also. Hence in No. 2 the guide-tubes have no duty to perform, and the
 water flows in them exactly as if it were left unguided, but had still through-
 out its terminal interface the stated system of distributed pressures somehow

  applied.

    Now, for completing the demonstration of Theorem II., nothing remains
 needed except to show that this stated system of distributed pressures

 requisite to be applied throughout the terminal interface at E' will very
 exactly be applied on that interface backwards by the water in front of it,

 which constitutes, for the time being, the continuation of the stream past

  that interface.

    FFor proof of this, conceive any cross interface F (fig. 9) further for-
 ward in No. 1 than E E is, and conceive a similarly situated cross interface

 F' F' in No. 2. By exactly the same mode of reasoning as before (making

 use of the like supposed introduction and subsequent removal of guide-tubes),
        ON THE FLOW OF WATER THROUGH ORIFICES.     257

that reasoning being now applied to the two flows commencing at the initial

BCD Cinterfaces
        and B' D', and continued to the terminal interfaces F V

and F' F', it results that if the jet in No. 1 be allowed to flow freely to and

far past the interface F F, the jet in No. 2 terminating at F' F' can be

left to flow unguided, with stream-lines similar to those in No. 1 , and with

the same relations of pressures and velocities at its various places to the

pressures and velocities in No. 1 as have been already proved for the flow

terminating at E' E', provided that homologous pressures »i^ times those at

F F be anyhow maintained at F' F'. Thus, then, we see that if adjusted

or requisite pressure systems, such as have been already fully exjilained, be

maintained at F F and F' F', the two streams, one extending backward ·

FFfrom  to E E, and the other from F' F' to E'E', will transfer backward

just such pressures to successive places in retrograde order in their courses

as that they will of themselves apply, at the interfaces E E and E' E', ex-

actly the already specified requisite pressure sj'stems. Thus we can depart

No. 1.           Fig. 9.

                          No. 2.

as far as we please from the orifices forward along the two streams to the

places where, for purposes of reasoning, certain definite pressures are to be

supposed to be applied in two homologous cross interfaces. Now it may be

taken as evident that, by going far enough away from the orifice to the
terminal cross interface, we can make, for any disturbances or departures

from the specified pressure relations, the effects propagated backwards to

the water in and near the orifices as small as we please ; or that, even if
we were to apply not exactly the strictly requisite pressure systems at those

terminal places, still the effects of this departure from perfect exactitude

would fade away rapidly in either stream as we transfer the place under

consideration backwards against the current towards the orifice. In corro-

boration of this, observation on the flow of water spouting from an orifice

may be appealed to as setting this matter beyond doubt, through its showing

that any changes of pressure introduced in a jet of water at any place far

away from the orifice (aa, for instance, by the insertion of a rigid obstruction)

will transmit scarcely the slightest effect back to the region of the orifice ;

or, in other words, that in a free-flowing jet spouting through the air, the

effects of obstructions fade away rapidly in the direction contrary to the

current, so as to become imperceptible at a very moderate distance taken

--back from the obstacle in the direction against the flow very moderate

relatively to the thickness of the jet.

Even "without this appeal to experimental observation, we might almost

intuitively perceive, or might readily admit, that the introduction of more or

less pressure than any stated amount in the stream, at a place where it has

got well clear of the orifice, would be only very slightly influential on the

flow as to pressures and as to velocities and directions of motion within the

Avessel and near the orifice and contracting vein.                       reason for this is, that

while an obstruction in a free jet will require a great change in mode of

flow of the jet close in front of it, yet the jet approaching to that region

need have its outer filaments turned aside only very slightly indeed to allow

of aU parts moving forward without any of their stream-lines, whether me-

dial or at or near the surface, being subjected to almost any increase of

pressure, and consequently without the velocities of any of them being almost

at all retarded. This will readily be clearly understood by reference to

fig. 10, where the water is shown as spouting against a stone without being

                                                            Fig. 10.

made to thicken its stream sensibly in consequence of the obstruction, except

Gfor a very short distance at in front of the stone--that is to say, in the

back-stream direction from the stone. If we were to suppose that the stone

would have a tendency to produce, at such a place as K, any considerable

increase of pressure in the internal or central stream-filaments of the jet, we

would have to notice that the external stream-filaments next the atmosphere

would fail to resist this augmented pressure ; and, instead, they would, with

only a very slight change in their own velocities or pressures, yield a little

outwards, and so would not exert on the internal filaments the confining

action that would be requisite for the maintaining of more than an extremely

slight augmentation of pressure in those internal filaments. Then it is obvi-

ous that if the pressure is very little augmented, the velocity must be very

little  abated                           and so, for  this  reason, the  stream will  not  tend  to  thicken
                                      ;

itself except very slightly, because any considerable increase of cross-sectional

area of the stream would require an important abatement of velocity, which,

as said before, would require a great increase of pressure in the internal

filaments, while the external filaments would fail to exert that necessary
confining pressure. These external filaments could, with very little change

in their own velocities, allow even of a great augmentation of the cross-

sectional area of the jet if the internal filaments, by abated velocity, were
requiring to become considerably thicker fhuu before, in virtr.e of the intro-
duction of the obstruilifin. It is only the mpid change of direction of motion
of the particles of water in the outer filam.enta in the neighbourhood of G,

close to the obstruction, that enables them, by what may be called their

centrifugal force, to maintain a greatly increased internal pressure very close

to the obstruction, and so to allow of Ihc water in the internal stream-fila-
n;ents abating its velocity, and of tliosc filaments themselves swelling in their

transverse dimensions.
    These considerations complete all that is necessary for the demonstration

of Theorem II., and it may now be regardtd as proved.

FoRMTTLA FOB THE FlOW OF "WaTER IN THE V-NOTCH.

From the foregoing principle we can find intuitively the formula for the

quantity of water which will flow through a V-notch in a vertical plane sur-

Weface, as in fig. 11.  can see it at once by considering any stream-filament

                        Fig. 11.

in the flow in one notch, and the homologous stream-filament in the simila
flow in another notch similarly formed, but having its vertex at a difl'erent
depth below the still-water surface-level. Let the ratio of the depth of the
vertex of the one notch below the still-water surface-level to the depth of
the vertex of the other be as 1 to n, so that all homologous linear dimensions
in the two flows will be likewise as 1 to n. Then, in passing from any cross
section of one of the two homologous filaments to the homologous cross section

xof the other, we have the cross-sectional area n^, and the velocity of flow
Vwoc ; and the volume of water flowing per unit of time, being as the cross-

sectional area and the velocity conjointly, will vary as we pass from the one
to the other of the pair of homologous filaments, so as to be oc n'Vn. Then,

as this holds for every pair of homologous stream-filaments throughout the

two flows, if we put Q, to denote the quantity, reckoned voluminally, flowing
per unit of time in each of the two entire flows, we have

                                        Qa Hi.

    Now, as well as considering two separate notches with different streams
flowing in them at the same time, we may, when it suits our purpose, con-

sider one single notch with streams of different depths flowing at different
times ; and if in various cases, either of the same V-notch or of different but

the level of the vertex of the notch by 1i, we have

Qi=cU,             (9)

where c is a constant coefficient, which cannot be determined by theory, but
can be very satisfactorily determined by experiment for any desired ratio of
horizontal width to vertical depth to be adopted for the form of the notch.
Experiments determining the values of c for certain forms and arrangements
of V-notches, suited for practical convenience and utility, have already been
made by myself, and have been reported on to the British Association ; and
the Reports on them are printed in the British Association volume for Leeds

  Investigation of a Foemvia for the Flow of "Water in a Rectangular
                 Notch with Level Crest in a Vertical Plane Face.

   It is to be premised that the long-known and generally used formulas for
the flow of water in rectangular notches, brought out by the so-called
" theories " which I have dissented from in the earlier part of the present
paper, have been mainly of the form

where Q, denotes the volume per unit of time,

        L denotes the horizontal length of the notch,

          h the vertical height from the crest of the notch to the stiU-water
                   surface-level, and

           g the coefficient for gravity,
and where c has either been taken as a constant numerical coefficient for
want of accurate experiments to determine its values for different values of

L and li, or has been treated as a variable. Poncelet and Lesbros have

taken this latter course, and have deduced by experiments extensive tables

--of its values for different depths of water in notches of the width on which

they experimented a width, namely, of 20 centimetres*. As, however, the
 coefficient for terrestrial gravity varies but little for different parts of the
world, it has most frequently been left out of account, a single coefficient c!
being used instead of eg ; so that if, for instance, when the foot and second

are used as units of length and time, we take 32-2 as a correct enough state-

=ment of the value of g for any part of the world, we have c' 32-2c.

   A new formula, involving an important improvement in its form and

 adjusted so as to be in due accordance with numerous elaborate experiments,
 was developed within or about the time from 1846 to 1855, in America, by
 Mr. Boyden and Mr. Francis, both of Massachussetts. It is

                    level in feet, and

ON THE FLOW OF WATER THROUGH ORIFICES.     261

     This formula was ofFcrcd by Mr. James B. Francis, in his work entitled
  " Lowell Hj-draiilic Experiments," and published at Boston in 1855, not as
  one founded on any complete theoretical views, but as one depending on

  several assumptions probably not perfectly correct, and yet as one which,

 through numerous trials and by adjustments introduced tentatively in fitting

 it to experimental results, had been brought out so as to agree very closely

 with experiments.

  --In § 120, at page 72 of his work, Mr. Francis says : " No correct formula

 " eluding- the secondary eflects of these laws, being known, we must rely

 " entirely upon experiments, taking due care in the application of any formula
 " deduced from thence not to depart too far from the limits of the experiments

 " on which it is founded." And in §§ 123, 124, at page 74, in respect to the

--conception of the formula, he further gives the following very clear expla-

 nations : " The contraction which takes place at the ends of a weir dimi-

 " nishes the discharge. When the weir is of considerable length in proportion

 " to the depth of the water flowing over, this diminution is evidently a con-

 " stant quantity, whatever may be the length, provided the depth is the same
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

 " we may, therefore, assume that the end contraction effectively diminishes the
 " length of such weirs, by a quantity depending only upon the depth upon
 " the weir. It is evident that the amount of (his diminution must increase
 " with the depth ; we are unable, however, in the present state of science, to

 " discover the law of its variation ; but experiment has proved that it is very
 " nearly in direct proportion to the depth. As it is of great importance, in
 " practical applications, to have the formula as simple as possible, it is assumed
 " in this work [ilr. Francis's book] that the quantity to be subtracted from
 " the absolute length of a weir having complete contraction, to give its effective
 " length, is directly proportional to the depth. It is also assumed that the
 " quantity discharged by weirs of equal effective lengths varies according to a
 " constant power of the depth. There is uo reason to think that either of
 " these assumptions is perfectly correct ; it will be seen, however, that they
 " lead to results agreeing very closely with experiment.

    " The formula proposed for weirs of considerable length in proportion to
 " the depth upon them, and having complete contraction, is

                              "Q = C(L-6n7i)7t*;

=" in which Q, the quantity discharged in cubic feet per second
           =" C a constant coefficient

             " L=the total length of the weir in feet

           =" 6 a constant coefficient
           =" n the number of end contractions. In a single weir having com-

                         plete contraction, n always equals 2 ; and when the length

                              of the weir is equal to the width of the canal leading to it,

                    n = 0;
          ="A the depth of water flowing over the weir taken far enough

                             upstream from the weir to be unaffected by the curvature
                             in the surface caused by the discharge

           "a=a constant power."

   This formula, Mr. Francis states, was first suggested to him by Mr. Boyden

in 1846.

   The important novel feature in this formula consists in the subtraction

which it makes, from the length L of the notch, of a length for each end

coutraction directly proportioual to the height of the stiil-wuter surface-Ie\cl

above the crest in order to lind what may be treated iu the formula as the

effective length.

   The formula in its general form here last noted expressed only in symbols,

as also in its subsequently developed form here previously stated with

numerical coefficients aiTived at by tentative application of numerous exjje-

rimenta, is thus to be regarded as an ingeniously arranged and valuable
empirical foimnla, but not as one founded on any trustworthy hydrokinetic
theory. It is founded partly on the old ordinary false " theoretical" views,
and partly on good conjectural assumptions, and is adjusted and approxi-

mately verified by elaborate experiments conducted on a scale unusually

large, and with unusually good means for attainment of exact results.

Mr. Francis, it is to be noticed, explains that, in the formula as finally
brought out, the index for the power of the height of the water is taken as

an exact fraction, %, in preference to some unascertained fractional expression,
different in no great degree from 4, merely for the attainuient of faeilitj" in

calculations in the practical applications of the formula, and riot for any

theoretic reason. Also it is to be noticed, in respect to the value -^ which
he assigned for the symbol h, that the symbol itself was tirst assumed as a
constind rather than some unknown variable dependent on /;, and was after-

wards fixed at the particular value J^f for the sake, in both cases, of attaining
a convenient degree of sim])licity which by trials was found to be attainable,

consistently with good accordance between the representations afi'orded hy

the formula and tiie results shown by experiments. He supposed, however,

that " many other values of a and b (probably an unlimited number) might
*' be found that would accord somewhat nearer with the experiments"*.

   Many years ago, after my having become acquainted with the empirical
formula thus made out by Mr. Boyden and Mr. Francis, it occurred to me as

desirable to attempt to investigate by hydrokinetic principles, without special

experiments, a true formula for the flow of water in rectangular notches in

vertical thin plates, or vertical plane faces, on the hypothesis of the water

being a perfect or frictionless lluid, and by using iu the formula symbols

for constant coefficients, which, after the finding of the formula, might be
determined by a small number of accurate experiments, and might further
be tested as to their trustworthiness, or might be amended so as to become
more exact, by a large number of varied experiments. It will be interesting
to notice that the formula which had previously been arrived at in America

by Mr. Boyden and Mr. Francis in the way already described is in perfect
agreement with the formula which, by ray own investigation, is brought out
by strict scientific principles as a highly exact formula for water considered

as a perfect fluid, and as being a very satisfactory representation of the truth

for real water.

   It is to he noticed at the outset that obviously a notch may be made so

long relatively to the depth of its crest from the still-water surface-level,

that, for any additional length, the increase of the flow will be proportional

mto the additional length. Let niJi, in which is a constant multiplier, be

such a length as that, for additional length, the additional flow ^ndll be pro-

Aportional to the addition made to the length. In fig. 12 let B be the crest

Dof the notch, and let C be the level of the still-water surface of the pent-up

of the crest there will flow a quantity of water exactly proportional to the

length of E F if the width of the notch be varied while the depth h of the
water remains unchanged. Let the length E F bo denoted by I ; then

                                    Z = L mh.

Now, out of the entire flow, conceive the middle portion which flows over

E F, and may be regarded as bounded laterally by two veilical planes per-
Rpendicular to the plane of the orifice, one passing through E and the other

through F S, to be taken away ; and suppose the two remaining parts which

AEflow over  and BF, with the necessary lateral parts of the notch-plate,

to be brought together as shown in fig. 13, so as to form one notch having

                                    Fig. 12.

mh for its width and h for the height from crest to still-water level, and in

which, therefore, the width of the notch shall bear a constant ratio to the

mheight of the water, when the height varies, the width being always times

the height.

   Then, by exactly the same mode of procedure as that already 'used for
finding a formula to show how the quantity of water flowing in a V- notch
varies with the depth of the vertex or with any other linear dimension of the
flowing stream, we can readily see that if we put Q' to denote the volume of
water flowing per unit of time in the case represented in fig. 13, we shall

have

                                    Q' = a/tVA,      (10)

where a is a constant coefiicient.

Next to find an expression for the quantity (voluminaUy reckoned) flowing

over the middle part E F of the crest, we may consider, first, of that middle

G Kpart, a portion  taken always of a length bearing a constant ratio to h ;

and for simplicity we may take it of length equal to h*. Now in this stream,

  * Or, to meet the case in wliich tliere might not be, between E and F, a length so great

88 h, we might as well consider, in another notch having great width and having a height
of flow equal to h, a portion of the flow not near either lateral extremity of the notch, and

occupying a length oi the crest equal to h.
             --

--264 REPORT 1876.

since the width has in general a constant ratio to the depth, or, in the case
more particularly considered, since the width is equal to the depth, the
quantity flowing per unit of time will, as in the preceding case, be propor-

tional to the I power of the depth ; or we have

                 Mow over GK=j3h^^h, where fi is constant.

Hence if q^ be the flow, in units of volume per unit of time, over a unit of

length in E F, we have

                                                 q^=l3JWh.

By multiplying this by I we get the quantity flowing over the entire middle

part E F per unit of time ; and so, denoting that quantity by Q", we have

Q"=l3lh^/h,         -^

                        (11)

or Q"=(i(L-mh)h'^hJ

Adding the expressions for Q' and Q," together, we get for the total flow in
the whole notch, which we may denote by Q,

                           Q=p(L--mh)]WJi + aJiWh,

or Q=l3LhVh-(i3m-a)JiWh,

or a=/3(L-f(3cm^--At);.l

-- --But - is a constant ; and let it be denoted by 26 ; and instead of the

          P
constant (i we may, in order now to use English letters, put a. Then

Q=a(L-2bh)hi,           (12)

which is the desired formiila for the flow of water in a rectangular notcli
with two end contractions.

    This formula admits of easy modification to give a formula suitable for a
notch with only one end contraction*, thus:

   Let the width of the notch with only oue end contraction be denoted by L

(as in fig. 14). Then conceive a notch twice as wide with two end contractions
as shown in fig. 15. The flow in this double space will, by the formula last

--obtained (12), be seen to be =a(2L 2bh)h^ ; and so if we put now Q to

deuote the flow in the notch under consideration (shown in fig. 14), which
will be half the flow in fig. 15, we have for the notch with only one end

contraction

Q,=a{L-bh)h'-           (13)

   * It is to be understood that contraction may be presented nt either end of a notch by

there being a vertical plane side face for the channel of approach to the notch, tliat side
face being perpendicular to the plane of the notch, and extending up-stream from the
notch so as to reach beyond the region of incipient rapid flow to the notch, and extending
for a little way down-stream past the notch, so as to afford the necessary guidance to the
issuing stream-filaments. In like manner, by two parallel vertical side walls or side faces

to the channel, when the crest of the notch extends quite across from the one wall-face to
the other, contraction may be prevented at both ends.

Fig. 15.

Also from (11), by changing, as done before, the letter /3 into the English
letter a, we see that for a notch with no end contraction (contractions being
prevented at both ends by vertical guiding side faces ijerpendicular to the

plane of the notch) we would have

Q,=aUi'                                        (14)

   Now the thi'ee formulas (12), (13), and (14) may be combined so as to be

expressed together, thus :

Q,=a{lj-nhh)h'-,                               (15)

where n is the number of end contractions, and must be either 2, 1, or 0.
   To determine the constants a and 6, all that would be necessary would be

to have two very accm-ate experiments on the flow of water in one notch at
different depths, or in two notches of the same kind with the ratio of the
width to the depth not the same in both. Then, putting into the formula

the measured values of L, h, and Q for the one experiment, and then again

those for the other, we would have two equations with two unknown sym-
bols, and so we could And the numerical values of those symbols. It would,

of course, be desirable, for experimental verification of the theory on which
the formula is foimded, as also for mutual verification or testing of the expe-
rimental results themselves, to have numerous experiments on the flow for

various depths in various notches of difi'erent widths, so as to find whether
the formula would fit satisfactorily to them all, or to all of them that, after

--comparison, would be found trustworthy provided that the width of the

notch be not too small in proportion to the depth of the flow, or that in all
cases the width be sufficient to allow of there being at least some small part
in the middle where the rate of flow per unit of time would be proiiortional
to the length of the part of the crest to which that flow would belong.

follows * :

where Q=the discharge in cubic feet per second;
         L=the length of the notch in feet;

          ii=the number of end contractions
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

           7i=the height from the crest to the still-water surface-level in feet.
    Mr. Francis also states that this formula is not applicable to cases in which
the height h from the crest to the still-water surface-level exceeds one third
of the lengtli, nor to very small depths. In the experiments from which it
was determined the depths varied from 7 inches to 19 inches ; and he remarks

that there seems no reason why it should not be applied with safety to any

depths between 6 inches and 24 inches.

   Rawlinson, Colonel Lane Fox, Sir Rawson Rawson, Mr. James
   Heywood, Dr. Mouat, Px'ofessor Rolleston, Mr. Hallett, Mr.
   Fellows, and Professor Leone Levi.

   The Anthropometric Committee have been engaged during the past year
in preparatory work. They have secured the cooperation of gentlemen hold-
ing positions under Government as inspectors of the army, of the navy, of
factories, and of pauper schools. They have prepared schedules and instruc-
tions, and have had them printed ; and they have purchased a small outfit of
instruments to send to places where measurements are to be made in large
numbers.

   Under these circumstances they are unable to make a report of anthropo-
metric results ; neither have they been called upon to expend more than a
small portion of the grant of £100 that was made to them in 1875, the

larger part of which will be required to pay for the reduction of observations.

Consequently they ask that the Anthropometric Committee may be reap-
pointed, with modifications, and that the grant may be carried forward to the

year 1876.

In continuation of the paper on this subject published in the Iteport for 1874
(pp. 218-240), 1 beg to submit the foUowiog brief discussion of the cj'clones
of the Indian Ocean, between the equator and 34° S., in the rears 1868-75,
and of the rainfall in different places from 1854 to 1872.

   The number of cyclones in each year, the positions of their centres at noon
on each day, their extent, duration, &c. have been approximately determined
in the way already described, and the results are given in Table I.

   From that and the similar Table given in 1874 we obtain the following

general results for the twenty years 1856-75 :

of the spaces (considered more or less circular) over which the wind blew
with the force of a " strong gale." They therefore are not the entire areas.
But, apart from this, owing to incomplete information, the radii are not known
for each day, and hence the areas are only rough approximations. There is
no doubt, however, that they increased from 1856 or 1857 to 1860, decreased
from 1860 to 1867, increased from 1867 to 1872, and then decreased to

1875.

   On the whole, there was a similar progression in the duration of the
cyclones, the smallest number of days being in 1856, 1857, 1867, and 1875,

and the greatest in 1861 and 1870,
   The total areas, i. e. the products of the mean area of each cyclone by the

number of days it lasted, increased from 1856 to 1861, decreased from 1861
to 1867, increased from 1807 to 1872, and then decreased to 1875.

    It is to be remarked, however, that the total areas for the years 1860-62

were much greater than those for the years 1870-72. This may be owing
partly to the radii for the latter years having been underestimated. On the
other hand, the number of cyclone-days in the years 1870-72 was somewhat

greater than in the years 1859-61.

                                                                      liainfall.

   A sufficient number of rainfall returns for the years 1873-75 have not yet

been obtained ; but the annual mean rainfalls at seventy-seven stations from
1854 to 1863, and at seventy-two stations from 1864 to 1872, are given in

Table II., in which all the rainfall observations at my disposal have been

used, except a few Prussian and Mauritius ones, which would not have affected

the general resnlts.

   The Table shows that, with hardly an exception, the sun-spots and rain-
fall were both above or both below their respective averages in the same

years.

   By taking the longer period 1843-72, and expressing the amouuts of rain-
fall and sun-spots in percentages, we get the following results :

                      TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.          275

First Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Joule^ Prof. Sir W,

    Thomson, Prof. Tait, Prof. Balfoue Stewart, and Prof. Maxwell,

    appointed for the purpose of determining the Mechanical Equivalent
     of Heat.

We are able to report that progress has been made with the experiments

iindertakeu by Dr. Joule on behalf of the Committee. Friction of water is
the method he has employed ; and the average result of upwards of sixty
experiments is 773-1 in British gravitation units at Manchester, the greatest
deviation from the above average being ^1^.

    Experiments * have yet to be made on the capacity for heat of the brass
of which the calorimeter is constructed, which has provisionally been calcu-
lated from the results of Regnault for this alloy. The greatest possible error
which may have arisen in this way is believed to be 75-1^. Dr. Joule also
proposes to compare his mercurial thermometers with the air-thermometer,
with a view to obtain accurate boiling-points, and thus correct values of the
thermometric scale. The greatest correction which it may be found needful

to apply on this account amounts to about -j-i-^. These maximum corrections,

if taken in the same direction, would necessitate the addition of 4-5 to the
equivalent above named.

   The experiments made by Hirn on the friction of water have led him to
the number 786. But the average of his results, derived from the friction,
boring, and crushing of metals, gives 77-A.

   Assuming that the above experiments and those made by Dr. Joule for the
Committee on Standards of Electrical Resistance are to be relied on, the unit
issued by it would appear to have a resistance too small by -^.

   The Committee are happy in being able to state that Professor Maxwell
has been working some time with a view to the redetermination of this unit,
and that he has also undertaken fresh direct experiments for determining the

dynamical equivalent of the thermal unit.

Report of the Committee appointed for the purpose of promoting
    the extension, improvement, and harmonic analysis of Tidal Obser-

   vations. Consisting of Sir William Thomson, LL.D.,F.R.S., Prof.
   J. C. AvAus, F.R.S., J. Oldham, William Parkes_, M.Inst. C.E.,
   and Adnairal Richards, 7?. A'., F./?.S. Draiv mj9 6?/ Sir William

   Thomson.

Since the publication in 1873 of the Committee's Report for 1872, a large

amount of work has been gone through, in the way of harmonic analysis, ex-

hausting the funds at the disposal of the Committee for this purpose, but none

of the results have hitherto been published. They are now offered for pirbli-

cation in this final Report of the Committee, and along with them, by permission

* [These experiments, up to the present date, sliow a smaller capacity than that antici-

pated, bringing up the equivalent to 77-t-l, which will be subject to a small correction,
possibly amounting to jjn, on acsount of the thermometric scale error. Note, November

13, 1876. -J. P. J.]

276 REPORT--1870.

of the Council of the Royal Society, some further results obtained by aid of          I
grants of =£100 and .£50 made by it to Sir "W. Thomson out of the Govern-
ment-Grant Fund for scientific investigation. The work has been all done, as

heretofore, for the Committee, under the suiierinteudence of Sir W. Thomson,

by Mr.Eoberts and assistant calculators working under his immediate direction,
according to the plans described in the Reports for 1868 and 1869 and sum-
marized in the Report for 1 872. The work done for the Committee consists
of the full harmonic reduction of:

    (1) Ten years' observations taken by the self-registering tide-gauge at
Helbre Island, at the junction of the Mersey and the Dee.

   (2) Two years of Kurrachee, in addition to the three years previously

analyzed and published.

   (3) Two years' tidal observations by self-registering tide-gauge at San Diego
(lat. 32° 42' N., long. 117° 13' W.) on the coast of Cahfornia, and one year's

observations at Fort Clinch, Fernandina (30° 43' N., long. 81° 27'W.), Florida.
The work of the Royal Society consists of full harmonic reductions for three

years' observations by self-registering tide-gauge of West Hartlepool ; nine
months of Port Leopold; 119 days of Beechey Island; one year of Brest;

--and (a first attack on Mediterranean tides) one year of Toulon.
    Helhre Island, 1858 to 1867 inchisive. The results for Helbre Island have
been found from nearly ten years' consecutive observations taken by a self-

registering tide-gauge at Great Helbre, about eight miles direct or sixteen miles

by water-channels from the tide-gauge at Liverpool, on the St.George's landing-
stage. Both these tide-gauges are under the charge of Captain Graham H.
Hills, R.N., Marine Surveyor to the Board of the Mersey-Dock Estate ; and
the Committee is indebted to him for the loan of the tide-diagrams from which
the present results are obtained. The float of the Helbre Island tide-gauge
works in a well, into which the tidal water is admitted by a pipe below
low-water level. This connecting pipe is kept free hy about once every month
closing its mouth, and allowing the water to rush out at low water. The
tide-gauge clock is kept accurately to Greenwich mean time by time-signal
from Bidstonc Observatory. In the years 1860, 1863, and 1864, on account
of accidental interruptions, the observations only began on March 1, March 29,

 and June 3 respectively ; in each of the other seven years the observations
began on Jan. 1. The results of the harmonic analysis are given in the Tables
below. The datum_-level from which the mean heights A^, are calculated is
 the same as that used for Liverpool, being 12 feet below the level of the " old

 dock sill."
    The results shown in the Tables for the separate years agree fairly well to-

 gether. For example, the extreme difference for the value between the ampli-
 tudes of the solar semidiurnal (E^ of S) is -0879 of a foot, or scarcely more
 than an inch, and the epochs of the same tide 2°-l of the circle, or 4-2 minutes of

 time. The amplitude of the mean lunar semidiurnal tide (R, of M) varies from

 year to yeai', on account of the varying inclination of the moon's orbit to the
 earth's equatoi-, very nearly in accordance with the equilibrium theory as

 set forth in Tables II. and II'. (pp. 305 & 307).

     The variations which the Tables show in the values of the lunar declina-
 tional diurnal tides (E, of 0) and the lunisolar declinational diui'nal and
 lunisolar declinational semidiurnal (R^, R, of K) are likewise perfectly

 accouuted for.

    The following comparison between the evaluated results of the mean solar
 and mean lunar semidiurnal tides and their overtides, and of the compound

 Helmholtz lunisolar quarter-diurnal tide of Liverpool and Helbre Island, is
                          TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.                277

exceedingly iutercsting, and demoustrates the very rapid formation of overtides
in channels where the rise and fall is great in comparison with the depth at
low water. The results for Liverpool (Report 1872) are the means of seven
years' reductions, and for Helbre Island of ten years'. The value of the main
tides are approximately equal at both places, the solar and lunar semidiurnal
tides at Helbre Island being only about one and two per cent, respectively

less than the corresponding tides at St. George's landing-stage at Liverpool.

    The results for Kurrachee form a continuation of the three years' results
included in the Report for 1872. The previous results are given, quoted
below from the Report of 1872, along with the new results for the sake of
comparison. The results for the whole five years thus now given together
 agree very fairly with one another, and form a very vahiable set of tidal com-
 ponents for this portion of the Indian Ocean.

    Through the kindness of Professors Peirce and Hilgard, of the United- States
 Coast Survey, two years' tidal observations taken at San Diego on the coast
 of California, and one year's observations taken at Fort Clinch, Eernandina,
 Florida, have been placed at the disposal of the Committee. The harmonic
 analysis has been completed for these observations, and the results are given
below. The Committee are also indebted to the United-States Coast Survey
for the observations at Fort Point, California, and Cat Island, Gulf of Mexico,
of which the harmonic reductions were published in the Report for 1872.
These results also are repeated in the present Report, as well as those for

Kurrachee, for the sake of comparison.

    The agreement of results for the two years for Sau Diego is exceptionally
good throughout. There is a remarkable disproportion between the values

of the smaller and larger elHptic semidiurnal tides (R,, of L and N). The

eqnihbrium-theoretical proportion between these components is about as 1 to
7, but the proportion here is (mean of two years) about as 1 to 35. The
smaller component is exceptionally small.

    The retardation of phase of spring-tides (0-030 day) is less than that de-
termined for Fort Point, San Francisco Bay, and is the smallest value vet
found for any port.

    One of the chief points of interest in the results for Fort Clinch is the re-
markable disproportion between the mean solar and the mean lunar semi-
diurnal tides, which is as 1 to 6 very nearly. The equilibrium-theoretical

proportion being about as 1 to 2-1. This is very nearly fulfilled between the

solar and lunar diurnal tides (R^ of P and 0). The time of the coincidence
of phase of the P and dcclinational diurnal tides is here negative. This

is the first instance yet found of the coincidence happening hefore the times of
I^ew and Full Moon.

   Among the most interesting results found by the reduction of the tides

of these two places, is that at San Diego the proportion between the two
chief tides is nearly identical with what the equilibrium-thoory gives, namely,
about 2-1 to 1, while (as said above) the proportion between them at Fort
Clinch is about as 6 to 1, or the ratio of the solar tide to the hiiiar tide is
only one third of the value which the equilibrium theory assigns to it.

280 REPORT--1876.

   Eemark an abrupt diminution in the height of mean level after the first
two years, which the following extract from a letter received from Prof.

J. E. Hilgard fully explains :

   " The change in the mean-level reading at Fort Point is a matter of much
" annoyance to us. The tide-gauge Avas put iip in a small building near the
" end of a wharf, and the tide-staff used for comparison was close to it.

*' Now it was observed after the observations had continued some time that

" the wharf was settling, at least the part where the gauge stood. Then
" the gauge was moved to a point a little nearer to the shore believed to be
" firm ; but we think the whole wharf settled and continued to do so for years.
" There seems to be a bog-formation underlying the surface deposit at that
" place. There is probably no way of ascertaining the amount of settling

" except from the observations themselves. We are now having frequent

" levelliugs made, referring the tide-staff to a rocky ledge further inland."

   The results of the three years' reductions agree, on the -whole, well
together. The following small components, however, are somewhat discordant,
viz. the elliptic diurnal tide J, the smaller component of the evcction semi-
diurnal tide A, and the luuisolar compound semidiurnal tide 2SM.

   The good agreement hetwcen the separate determinations of the mean sea-

level renders Hartlepool a favourable place for the purposes of trigonometrical

survey, the annual tide also being much less in amount than at Liverpool,
to the mean sea-level of which the present survey of the United Kingdom is

referred.

   The values of the diurnal components are as largo as those for Liverpool,
where the mean solar and lunar semidiurnal tides ar«5 nearly double the values
of those for Hartlepool, and arc the largest yet evaluated for English ports.

   The value of the smaller elliptic semidiurnal tide (L) agrees very nearly
with the equilibrium-theory value of the values of this component for other

English ports, being considerably in excess of the theoretically assigned value.

The larger component (N) agrees exactly with that deduced from theory.

  A remarkable point in the deductions is the smallness of the ovortides of

the chief semidiurnal tides, and also of the compound luuisolar quarter-
diurnal tide (MS), which have been well marked in the other English ports
of which the observations have been analyzed.

    There is scarcely sufficient agreement between the results deduced from

the long-period tides to be satisfactory, although the quantities of some are
within reasonable limits. The values for rj, as usual, show an undoubtedly

genuine annual tide of about three inches with its maximum about the end

of October or beginning of November, which agrees with the time given for
other English ports. Of the other long-period tides, the synodic fortnightly

--[2((r t])'] gives a fair agreement between the values deduced from the separate

j'ears.

Results of Hourly Tide-observations taken at Beechey Island, Erebus Ray,

290 REPORT--1876.

    The tides at Port Leopold and at Beecliey Island, as seen from the above

analyzed constituents (due allowance being given to the different values for
I), are almost identical in character, the agreements of the components "when
compared being remarkably close.

   The diurnal components are large, and in the j'ears of maximum declination
of moon nearly sufficient at certain parts of the lunation to reduce the period

 of the tide to that of one tide only in the twenty-four hours.

    The narrrowness of Behring's Straits precludes the supposition that the
tides in the Arctic Ocean and among the channels of the Arctic Archipelago
are sensibly influenced by communication through it with the Pacific.

    The largeness of the values for the retardation of spring-tides renders it
probable that for these places the tidal influence is derived chiefly from the
Atlantic Ocean, and not by direct action of Sun and Moon on the waters of

the Arctic Ocean.

    The shortness of the series of these observations, especially those for
Beechey Island, has rendered some departure from the usual mode of reduction

desirable. The following explanation is therefore necessary :--The observa-

tions were first grouped according to mean solar hours, and the summations
and means obtained and the means analyzed. The values of the mean solar

 amplitudes thus obtained were then used for the calculation of the height of
the tide at each integral mean solar hour due to these constituents. The

heights were then copied for the previous values grouped according to mean

 solar hours, subtracting from each quantity the effect of the height due to
the mean sun, computed as above explained. These numbers were grouped
according to mean lunar hours, and the series of mean values analyzed as
before. The value of the tide at each mean lunar hour was then computed
 and subtracted from the previously copied series, and grouped according to
 sidereal hours and the reduction continued as before ; and so on throughout
the seven evaluated series. The values obtained for the smaller components
 found by these means are no doubt trustworthy.

     Notes on the Reductions of the Tidal Observations of Brest and Toulon.
                                         By Mr. Roberts.

    "With the kind assistance of M. Janssen the tracings from the original

 " registered tidal observations at Toulon for the whole of the year 1853 were
 " obtained from the Department of the Marine at Paris, and also a copy of
 " the heights at Brest for the year 1875. These two years' observations have
 *' been treated and reduced in a similar manner to the many years' tidal obser-
 " vations fully described in the Eeports of the Tidal Committee of the British
 " Association for the years 1868 to 1872. It wiU therefore be only necessary
 " in this place to give a general summary of the results obtained. The ob-
 " servations being given in metres, the results have been similarly expressed
 " in decimetres and centimetres, and not in English feet.

                                                     " Brest.

    " The proportion between the solar and lunar semidiurnal tides at Brest is
 " (allowing for the value of the Moon's declination) about as 1 to 3, and
TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.      291

" agrees fairly with the proportion found at most British ports. The elliptic
" semidiurnal tides agree within narrow limits with the values assigned by
" theory, as also those of the Evection and Variation semidiurnal. The
" overtides here, as at Toulon, are small, the mean lunar quarter-diurnal
" components amounting to 4-8 centimetres only, the main lunar semi-
" diurnal tide being 1-9887 metre. The terdiurnal component is about yi^
" of the chief tide, which accords with the proportion found at British ports.
" The diurnal components at Brest are very small, and are only about double
" the amounts found for Toulon, although the range of tide is about thirty

" times greater.

                                                              Toulo n.

    " The proportion between the solar and lunar semidiurnal tides at Toulon,

" having regard to the fact that the inclination of the Moon's maximum

 " orbit to the earth's equator for the year reduced was nearly at its greatest,
 " agrees very nearly with that assigned to it by the Equilibrium theory, and
" was found to be about as 1 to 2-2. Theovcrtides of the main semidiurnal
 " components were found to be very small, the largest, that of the first over-
 " tide of the lunar semidiurnal, scarcely exceeding 3 millimetres. The ter-
 " diurnal lunar tide amounts to about jL. of the main lunar semidiurnal, the

" proportion generally found for this component from many years' reductions
" at different ports being about of the chief component. The proportion

                                                                                                               ^'f,

" between the longer elliptic and the lunar semidiurnal is somewhat larger
 " than the deduced value according to the equilibrium theory, although that
" between the larger and smaller components agrees almost exactly. The
 " semidiurnal tides depending on the lunar perturbations of Evection and
 " Variation agree within reasonable limits with the equilibrium theoretical
" proportions. The evaluated diurnal components are very large, the luni-
" solar exceeding in value the mean solar semidiurnal. These large diurnal
" components give to the Mediterranean tides a totally different character
" from those of the North Atlantic, in which the diurnal tides are very small.
" The coincidence of phase of the main lunar and solar semidiurnal tides

" happening some 4 or 5 hours hefore the time of New or Full Moon would

" point to the conclusion that the tides at Toulon were wholly generated in the
" Mediterranean, and were scarcely if at all influenced by any action of the
" North Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar, the amount of ret-erdation
" of coincidence of phase for these components amounting on the western coast
" of Europe to between 30 and 40 hours. The evaluation of the long-period

" tides places the maximum of the solar annual tide at Dec. 30. The value

" of the lunar decliuational fortnightly tide is about 1| centimetres, or
" fo inch."

To facilitate comparisons between the various results of the harmonic ana-

lysis contained in this and the preceding Eeports, and to promote a complete

theoretical appreciation of them all, the following harmonic analj'sis of the

Aequilibrium tide will be found useful.  portion of it, that, namely, per-

taining to the mean semidiurnal, the declinational semidiurnal and the

elliptic semidiurnal constituents, was given in the Report for 1872 (§§ 48,
50). For the sake of clearness, an investigation of the equilibrium tide,

consisting chiefly of extracts from Thomson and Tait's ' Natui'al Philosophy,'

vol. i., is premised, as the first edition of that work is out of print, and the

second edition can scarcely appear until after the publication of this E-eport.

  M DLet E denote the earth's mass, the mass of the moon or sun, the dis-

tance between the centres of the two bodies, a the earth's radius. If we

neglect tides depending on the fourth and higher powers of =|T (of which only

one, Laplace's terdiurnal lunar tide, referred to in § 3 of the Committee's
Eeport for 1868, and again in § 5, 1872, can probably be sensible), the equi-
librium tide will not be altered by the following arbitrary but conveniently

Msymmetrical assumption. Imagine to be divided into two lialves, and let

Dthese be fixed at distances each equal to on opposite sides of the earth in a

line through its centre. Then if r, B be polar coordinates of any point referred
to the earth's centre as origin, and the line joining the two disturbing bodies
as axis, the equation of an equipotential sui-face is [Thomson and Tait,

This is a sjiherical surface harmonic of the second order, and -py^ is one

quarter of the ratio that the difference between the moon's attraction on the
nearest and furthest parts of the earth bears to terrestrial gravity. Hence

    " The fluid will be disturbed into a prolate ellipsoidal figure, with its
long axis in the line joining the two disturbing bodies, and with ellipticity

equal to | of the ratio which the diff'ercnce of attractions of one of the dis-
turbing bodies on the nearest and furthest points of the fluid surface bears to

the surface value of the attraction of the nucleus. If, for instance, we sup-
pose the moon to be divided into two halves, and these to be fixed on opposite

sides of the earth at distances each equal to the true moon's mean distance

the ellipticity of the disturbed terrestrial level would be  2 X 60 X 300000'                                                            nr

" 805. The rise and fall of water at any point of the earth's surface we may

now imagine to be produced by making these two disturbing bodies (moon and

anti-moon, as we may call them for brevity) revolve round the earth's axis

once in the lunar twenty-four hours, with the line joining them always in-

clined to the earth's equator at an angle equal to the moon's declination. If

we assume that at each moment the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium is

fulfilled, that is, that the free liquid surface is perpendicular to the resultant

force, we have what is called the ' equilibrium theory of the tides.'

" 806. But even on this equilibrium theory, the rise and fall at any place

would be most falsely estimated if we were to take it, as we believe it is

generally taken, as the rise and fall of the spheroidal surface that would bound

the water were there no dry land (uncovered solid). To illustrate this state-

Ament, let us imagine the ocean to consist of two circular lakes and B, with

their centres 90° asunder, on the equator, communicating with one another by

Aa narrow channel. In the course of the lunar twelve hours the level of lake

would rise and fall, and that of lake B would simultaneously fall and rise to

maximum deviations from the mean level. If the areas of the two lakes were

equal, their tides would be equal, and would amount in each to about i of

a foot above and below the mean level ; but not so if the areas were unequal.

Thus, if the diameter of the greater be but a small part of the earth's qua-

drant, not more, let us say, than 20°, the amounts of the rise and fall in the

two lakes will be inversely as their areas to a close degree of approximation.

For instance, if the diameter of B be only -^ of the diameter of A, the rise

Aand fall in will be scarcely sensible ; while the level of B will rise and fall

by about 1| feet above and below its mean ; just as the rise and fall of level

in the open cistern of an ordinary barometer is but small in comparison with

fall and rise in the tube. Or, if there be two large lakes. A, A', at opposite

extremities of an equatorial diameter, two small ones, B, B', at two ends of the

equatorial diameter perpendicular to that one, and two small lakes, C, C, at

two ends of the polar axis, the largest of these being, however, stiU supposed

to extend over only a small portion of the earth's curvature, and all the six

lakes communicate with one another freely by canals or underground tunnels :

Athere will be no sensible tides in the lakes and A' ; in B and B' there will

be high water of 1^ feet above mean level when the moon or anti-moon is

in the zenith, and low water of If feet below mean when the moon is rising

Cor setting ; and at C and  there will be tides rising and falling -^ of a foot

above and below the mean, the time of low water being when the moon or

anti-moon is in the meridian of A, and of high water when they are on the

horizon of A. The simplest way of viewing the case for the extreme circum-

stances we have now supposed is, first, to consider the spheroidal surface that

would bound the water at any moment if there were no dry land, and then

to imagine this whole surface lowered or elevated all round by the amount

Arequired to keep the height at and A' invariable. Or, if there be a large
Alake in any part of the earth, communicating by canals with small lakes

over various parts of the surface, having in all but a small area of water in

comparison with that of A, the tides in any of these will be found by drawing

a spheroidal surface of If feet difference between greatest and least radius,

and, without disturbing its centre, adding or subtracting from each radius

such a length, the same for all, as shall do away with rise or fall at A.
   " 807. It is, however, only on the extreme supposition we have made, cf

one water area much larger than all the others taken together, but yet itself

covering only a small part of the earth's curvature, that the rise and fall can.

place. Taking the actual figure of the earth's sea-surface, we must subtract

a certain positive or negative quantity a from the radius of the spheroid that

would bound the water were there no land, a being determined, according to

the moon's position, to fulfil the condition that the volume of the water

remains unchanged, and being the same for aU points of the sea at the same

time. Many writers on the tides have overlooked this obvious and essential

principle ; indeed we know of only one sentence* hitherto published in which

any consciousness of it has been indicated.
   " The quantity « is a spherical harmonic function of the second order of the

moon's declination and hour-angle from the meridian of Greenwich, of which

the five constant coefficients depend merely on the configuration of land and

water, and may be easily estimated approximately by not very laborious qua-

dratures, with data derived from the inspection of good maps.

required to let the water stand to this level everywhere. To do away

A --reduce the semidiurnal terms to the form cos(2;^ e), and the diurnal

    " 809. In the equilibrium theory, the whole deviation of level at any point

of the sea, due to sun and moon acting jointly, is expressed by the sum of

six terms, three for each body.

    " (1) The lunar or solar semidiurnal tide rises and falls n proportion to a
simple harmonic function of the hour-angle from the meridian of Greenwich,
having for period 180° of this angle (or in time, half the period of revolution

relatively to the earth), with amplitude varying in simple proportion to the

square of the cosine of the declination of the sun or moon, as the case may

be, and therefore varying but slowly, and through but a small entire range.
    " (2) The lunar or solar diurnal tide varies as a simple harmonic function

of the hour-angle of period 360°, or twenty-four hours, with an amplitude

varying always in simple proportion to the sine of twice the declination of the

disturbing body, and therefore changing from positive maximum to negative,
and back to positive maximum again, in the tropical* period of either body

in its orbit.

* Tlie tropical period differs from the sidereal period in being reckoned from the first

point of Aries instead of from a line fixed in space, the difference for the case of the sun

WObeing only one in 26,  years, and for the case of the moon one in 13 X 18-6.
298 REPORT-- 1876.

    " (3) The lunar fortnightly or solar semiannual tide is a variation on the
average height of water for the twentj-four lunar or the twentj^-four solar
hours, according to which there is on the whole higher water all round the
equator and lower water at the poles, when the declination of the disturbing
body is zero, than when it has any other value, whether north or south ; and

maximum height of water at the poles and lowest at the equator, when the
declination has a maximum, whether north or south. Gauss's way of stating

the circumstances on which 'secular' variations in the elements of the solar
sj^stem depend is convenient for explaining this component of the tides. Let
the two parallel circles of the north and south declination of the moon and
anti-moon at any time be drawn on a geocentric spherical surface of radius
equal to the moon's distance, and let the moon's mass be divided into two
halves and distributed over them. As these circles of matter gradually vary

each fortnight from the equator to maximum declination and back, the tide

produced will be solely and exactly the ' fortnightly tide.'
    " 810. In the equilibrium theory as ordinarily stated, there is at any place

high water of the semidiurnal tide precisely when the disturbing body, or
its opposite, crosses the meridian of the place ; and its amount is the same
for all places in the same latitude ; being as the square of the cosine of the

latitude, and therefore, for instance, zero at each pole. In the corrected

equilibrium theory, high water of the semidiurnal tides may be either before

or after the disturbing body crosses the meridian, and its amount is very
different at different places in the same latitude, and is certainly not zero at
the poles. In the ordinarily stated equilibrium theory, there is, lirecisely at
the time of transit, high water or low water of diurnal tides in the northern
hemisphere according as the declination of the body is north or south

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and the amount of the rise and fall is in simple proportion to the sine of
twice the latitude, and therefore vanishes both at the equator and at the

poles. In the corrected equilibrium theory, the time of high water may be

considerably either before or after the time of transit ; and its amount is very
different for different places in the same latitude, and certainly not zero at
either equator or poles. In the ordinary statement there is no lunar fort-

--nightly or semiannual tide in the latitude 35° 16' (being sin-^ -), and its

                                                                                                             \/3

amount in other latitudes is in proportion to the deviations of the squares of their
sines from the value g. In the corrected equilibrium theory each of these tides
is still the same in the same latitude, and vanishes in a certain latitude, and in
any other latitudes is in simple proportion to the deviation of the squares of their
sines from the square of the sine of that latitude. But the latitude where

-- --there is no tide of this class is not sin-i-- , but sin-i( v/--il ), where <it is

--the mean value of 3 sin'Z 1 for the whole covered portion of the earth's

surface, a quantity easily estimated by a not very laborious quadrature, from
sufficiently complete geographical data of the coast lines for the whole earth.

   " As the fortnightly and semiannual tides most probably foUow in reality

very nearly the equilibrium law, it becomes a matter of great importance to

evaluate this quantity ; but we regret that hitherto we have not been able to

undertake the work. Conversely, it is possible that careful determination of
the fortnightly tides at various places, by proper reduction of tidal observa-

tions, may contribute to geographical knowledge as to the amount of water

surface in the hitherto unexplored districts of the arctic and antarctic

regions.

'< :811. The superposition of tlie solar semidiurnal on the lunar semidiurnal

tide has been investigated above (§ 60) as an example of the composition of

simple harmonic motions ; and the weU-knowu phenomena of the ' spring-

tides ' and ' neap-tides ' and of the ' priming ' and ' lagging ' have been

Weexplained.      have now only to add that observation proves for almost all

places, whether oceanic islands or other open coast-stations, or in deep bays,

estuaries, or tidal rivers, the proportionate difference between the heights of

spring-tides and neap-tides, and the amount of the priming and lagging to be

much less than estimated in § 60 on the equilibrium hypothesis ; and to be
very different in different places, as we shall see in vol. ii. is to be expected

from the kinetic theory."

The four lunar and solar diarnal and semidiurnal tides spoken of in

§ 809 of the preceding extract are, in the harmonic analysis of this Com-

mittee, resolved into harmonic constituents with constant amplitudes and

epochs instead of the varying amplitudes and epochs which that statement

implies in virtue of the varying distances of the sun and moon from the

earth, and of the differences of their right ascensions from those of ideal

bodies moving uniformly in the plane of the earth's equator with constant

angular velocities equal to the mean angular velocities of the sun and moon

round the earth.

To investigate, for either moon or sun alone, the equilibrium values of

these simple harmonic constituents, and to exhibit the simple harmonic ex-

pression for the long-period deelinational tide represented by the first line of

D(238) § SO, call L the value of this line, the value of the second line (or

the whole complex diurnal equilibrium tide), and S the value of the third

line (or semidiurnal equilibrium tide).

would be the required complete simple harmonic expansion, if t were constant,
and if <p increased simply in proportion to the time.

   To complete the process we must, by aid of physical astronomy, express r

and (p in terms of y.
    For the case of the sun, the only deviation from uniform circular motion

which produces sensible influence on the tides is the elliptic inequality ; for

the case of the moon we must take into account also the perturbations called

evection and variation.

   Por the case of the sun we have

velocity of the moon's radius vector, and d the eccentricity of her orbit. With

these exphmations, it is better not to write out the formula, but rather to
refer to (XIII.). But to complete the harmonic expression of the lunar

equilibrium tide, so far as practically useful, we must include terms resulting

from erection and variation, ilr. Hoberts having, ia working out the harmonic
analysis of the Liverpool tides for the Committee, discovered verj' sensible
effects of these perturbations of the moon's motion, and having thenceforward
analyzed for them regularly in every case in which the data were sufficiently
complete. The only term of (VI.), (VII.), or (VIII.) having evectioual and
variational constituents which can be sensible in North-Atlantic ports is the
chief semidiurnal tide represented by the first terra of (VIII.). For other seas
than the North Atlantic, the evectional and variational constituents of the
two chief lunar diurnal tides represented by the first and last terms of (VII.)

may be quite sensible ; but it is not worth while at present to work out the

e(juilibrium-values of these constituents ; it is enough to give the equUibrium-
values of the evectional and variational perturbations of the chief semidiurnal
tide, as it is only for these effects of evection and variation that the reductions
hitherto performed give the data for comparison with observation.

--308 REPORT 1876.

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Brunton, F.R.S.,
   and Dr. Pye-Smith, appointed to investigate the Conditions of
   Intestinal Secretion and Movement.

The first part of the task of your Committee respected the comparative effect

on intestinal secretion of various salts locally applied, and the action of

other drugs, either mingled with these or injected into the blood, in modify-

ing their action. This was completed in our first lleport, in which we gave

an account of our experiments on the local action of purgative salts, and

stated that atropia has not the same inhibitory effect on intestinal secretion

which it has on that of the submaxillary gland.
   Secondly, we ascertained last year that the same " paralytic "' secretion which

Moreau observed in dogs and rabbits occurs under similar conditions in cats
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and, further, that this effect is not produced by division of the pneumogastric

nerves and cervical sympathetic cord, nor by section of the splanchnics and

spinal cord, and that all these sources of nervous supidy may be cut off, and

both semilunar ganglia extirpated, without paralytic secretion following.

We ventured to anticipate that the inhibitory centre sought would be found

Wein the smaller ganglia of the solar plexus.  had also noticed that hypersemia

or haemorrhage of the intestinal miicous membrane does not follow either upon

division of the splanehnics or upon extirpation of the lumbar portion of the

spinal cord, but frequently occurs wlien both these operations have been

performed together.

This year your Committee have succeeded in proving positively that the

conclusion they had reached by the method of exclusion is correct, namely,

that the paralj^tic secretion of Moreau may be produced by extirpation of the

smaller ganglia of the solar plexus, including those which are found in the

superior mesenteric plexus.

  We have also ascertained that removal of these ganglia is rarely followed

by hypei'Oimia or haemorrhage of the intestinal mucous memltraue.

Thirdly, turning to tlie last section of our investigation, the movements of

the intestine, we have obtained fairly conclusive evidence that its peristaltic

movement (in the cat) is unaffected by irritation of the distal end of the

divided splanehnics, but is called forth by stimulation of their proximal part.

  --The conclusions, then, to which your Committee have been led may be

thus summed up :

   1. Application of various soda and potash salts to the intestinal mucous
membrane produces a more or less profuse secretion, that caused by sulphate

of magnesia, acetate of potash, sulphate of soda, and tartrate of potash and

soda being most abundant.

2. The presence (in the intestine or in the blood) of atropia, morphia,

chloral, &c. does not prevent the above action of sulphate of magnesia.

3. The secretory nerves of the intestines have the small ganglia of the

solar and superior mesenteric plexuses for their centres ; hence secretion is
unaffected by section of the splanehnics, the vagi, or the dorso-lumbar part

of the cord.

   4. Destruction of the lumbar part of the cord, after extirpation of the solar

plexus, produces haemorrhage or hyperaemia of the intestinal mucous mem-

brane, which is absent after division of the splanehnics. destruction of the

semilunar ganglia and solar plexus, or division of the mesenteric nerves

themselves.

   5. The splanchnic nerves are, as usually admitted, the vasomotor nerves of
the intestines, but have no centrifugal fibres to their muscular coats, and
can only indirectly affect them by diminishing their supply of blood.

    (5. The splanchuics are the afferent nerves which regulate peristalsis of the

intestine, the efferent stimulus probably reaching its intraparietal ganglia

through the lumbar cord and abdominal sj-mpathetic.
   The following are the details of the experiments made this year. With

those described in our two preceding Reports, they make up a total of more

than a hundred, as the basis of the above conclusions.

      In the first series we continued and completed the experiments in our last

Report, undertaken to ascertain the nervous centre, separation from which

produces the " paralytic " secretion of Moreau. Starting from the negative

results with which we concluded our research last year, it will be seen that,

of the thirteen cases in which we removed the solar or the superior mesenteric

plexus, paralytic secretion resulted abiuidantly in Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 13, where

both Avere removed. Tlie same effect was produced in Nos. 7, 8, and 10,

whero the splanchuics and semilunar ganglia were left intact, and only the

smaller (inferior) ganglia of the solar plexus, with the superior mesenteric

offset from it, were excised. In No. 5, and also in No. 14, the paralytic

secretion was likewise present, though less abundant. In four cases

(Nos. 4, 6, 9, and 11) there was little or none; but in three of these

cases the dissection, by which we verified in each case the completeness of

the lesion produced, showed that the plexus had only been torn away from

the artery without complete excision of its ganglia ; and in No. 11 the superior

mesenteric plexus was simply cut across, so as to separate it from the semi-

lunar ganglia and splanchuics, with the superior part of the solar plexus. Thus

the negative results here, like those of last year's experiments, confirm

our present conclusions. In No. 12 there was enough fiuid foimd to

fill  the loop moderately, but the  rest of the intestine was  empty                                    dis-
                                                                                                     :

section did not show any defect in the previous operation, nor had there

been htemorrhage, diarrhoea, or sickness. It will, however, be noted that in

this experiment less time Lad elapsed than in any of the others (2 instead of

3|, 4, 5, or (3 hours) ; and this fact, taken with the observation of the most

abundant secretion having followed the longest period between the excision

of the plexus and the animal being killed (see No. 7), may perhaps explain

the scanty secretion in this instance.

    The concluding series of experiments are on a diflicult subject, which has
already engaged the attention of Ludwig and his pupils, of Lister, Pfiiiger,
Wundt, Von Basch, and other distinguished physiologists. AVhether we are
justified in the conclusions which we have drawn we must wait for time to
determine, and will only add that we are well aware of the many possible

fallacies which attend the inquiry, as well as of the conflicting results of

previous investigators.

fortunate in securing the requisite Certificate from the Home Oflice, has

--obtained fresh results confirming those of the second series of these experi-

ments. July 1877.

  --14. Cat under chloroform. Abdomen opened, and intestines exposed for

o or 6 minutes to the air. No movement. The interrupted current from

DuBois Reymond's induction-coil was used in this and the succeeding ex-
periments. Electrodes placed under left splanchnic. Secondary coil at 25,
no effect ; at 15, doubtful ; at 10, rapid anaemia of stomach and small intes-
tines and of a large mesenteric gland. No movement. Coil at 7 : con-
tinued anJBmia, which now extended to the kidneys ; no movement ; after

removal of the irritation, the ansemia continued and even increased for a
short time in the intestines, the kidneys recovering their normal vascularity
more quickly.

After the intestines had regained their normal vascularity, the coil was put

at 5, and the left splanchnic again irritated for 5 minutes. The effect was

the same, but much less decided than before. After the current was stopped,

the intestines became rapidly hypersemic. The irritation once more applied,

with the coil at 0, ansemia only ensued after 30 seconds. No movement

of the intestines. Ten minutes later the current was applied to the

right splanchnic with the secondary coil at 25 : no effect. Coil moved to

15 :  anaemia of .stomach  and intestines                                                              slight movement, which liad begun

before the first irritation, now ceased. Current stopped : normal vascularity

recovered; peristalsis began again, and became rather active; ecchymosis

apparent under the tunic of the right kidney.

Intestines at rest : vascularity normal. Right splanchnic irritated with coil

at 10 : after two minutes, anaemia of stomach and some coils of intestine.
Moved to 5, the large arteries became evidently smaller, though the vascularity

of the viscera was still only partially affected. After two minutes more no

movement.

The solar jjlexus, including the semilunar ganglia, was now excised, and

the superior mesenteric artertj isolated. The intestines were somewhat hyper-

semic, the kidneys normal, peristalsis rather active. An upper and lower

loop of 8 in. each ligatured as before. Coil at 15 : electrodes applied to both

splanchnics so as to irritate them at the same time : no antemia ; movement

slightly increased.  Coil at 10 :  no anaemia                                                          movement considerably increased.
                                                                                         ;

Coil at 5 : active peristalsis of stomach and intestines, doubtful decrease of

vascularity.

    The left splanchnic was next divided, and the electrodes applied to its
pro.vimal end, with the coil at 2.5. The movomeuts which were going on
before continued active, while the coil was moved to 15, 1(1, and 5. Slight

anaemia appeared with the coil at 15, and did not increase. After the
current was stojjped, the intestines continued their movements, and quickly
recovered a normal or perhaps slightly excessive vascularity. Frcsli irrita-
tion a few minutes later (of the proximal end of the left splanchnic) produced
no change in vascularity or in movement of the intestine.

    The cat died several hours later without having vomited. The greater
part of the small intestine contained only a moderate quantity of fluid, but

the lower loop was filled with serum and thick white mucus. No worms.
On dissection the right semilunar ganglion and solar plexus adjacent were

found to be imjierfectly removed : otherwise the operation had succeeded.

  --15.- Cat under chloroform. Abdomen opened and electrodes put on the

left splanchnic, -w'lih coW fit 25: no peristalsis, moderate injection. Current

on: at first apparent slight increase of vascularity, but when the coil was
moved to 15, pallor, with contiaction of the branches of the superior mesen-
                                                                                                        :

teric artery, became marked. No movement of stomach or intestines took

place.

  --16. Cat chloroformed and put into a bath of -75 per cent, salt solution at

90° to 100° F., with the trachea opened so as to allow of complete immer-
sion*. After electrodes had been put on both splanclmks, with the intestines
at rest and moderatclj' injected, the current was put on with a commutator,
so as to pass through both nerves at once with the coil at 25, shifted after

two minutes to 15, and then to 5 and to 0, but without visible effect.

  --17. Cat chloroformed and abdomen opened. Intestines pale. Pregnant

uterus. No peristalsis. Both splanchnics divided. Proximal end of right

irritated, with the coil at 25. After two minutes the uterus began moving
on breaking the circuit this ceased gradually. The same occurred on applpng
the electrodes in the same way to the left splanchnic, the intestines still re-
maining motionless and their injection not varying. The narcosis was kept
only moderately deep, the tail constantly moving. At every third or fourth

expiration there was a strong contraction of the abdominal walls with relaxed

dia])hragm (eifort at vomiting).

Electrodes were then applied to (the proximal end of) both splanchnics,

and the current passed through both at once. Coil at 25 : no change : intes-

tines  drawn  out from  abdomen   so  as  to  bring the  greater part into  view                        they
                                                                                                     ;

were motionless and moderately vascular. Coil at 15, current on : active

peristalsis began, and soon spread to all the small intestines ; the uterus also
moved as before ; vascularity of the viscera not altered. After three minutes
the current was stopped, and the movements quickly ceased. Repeated with
the coil at 5 and at 10 no effect was produced, but general movements of the

voluntary muscles ensued from escape of the current.

The animal was then placed in a bath of "75 per cent, of salt solution at

10, increased activity of motion, the colon continuing quiet, and the vascu-
larity of the viscera not affected, except as the tight contraction of the gut

produced transient pallor. On stopping the current, peristalsis ceased within

two minutes.

  stalsis, but no other change. "With the coil at 15 there was no movement,
  but the intestines were more vascular than before, which may, however, have
  been due to sponging with warm water to remove some blood.

     Experiment repeated with the animal in the bath. There was then no
  change in vascularity, and no movement, except very slight peristalsis in a
  single coil. (This cat had suffered from haemorrhage, owing to the liver being
  bruised in restoring it by artificial respiration. The fact was discovered after

--the animal was killed, and explained its feeble state during the experiments.)
      19. Cat chloroformed. Both splanchnies divided. Electrodes placed on
 proximal end of left, and the animal immersed in the bath at 100° F. There
 was at first active peristalsis, and after this had ceased, stimulation, with the

 coil at 2-5, produced no effect on the vasculaiity or movement of the intes-
 tines. Repeated out of the water there was still no movement, but the in-
 testines became less vascular while the current passed, and then somewhat

 hyperasmic.

     Stimulation of the proximal end of the right splanchnic out of the bath
 produced active peristalsis. The vascularity varied irregularly, and probably
 independently, with moderate injection after the current was stopped.

    On the left splanchnic being again irritated after an interval (with the coil

 still at 25), peristalsis, which had become very languid, was distinctly in-
 creased. The intestines became pale during the strong contraction of each
 coil, but otherwise their vascularity was unaffected.

    Stimulation of the splenic plexus reduced the length of the spleen from 3^
to 3^ inches.

Report of the Committee, consisting of A. Vernon Harcourt, Professor
    Gladstone, and Dr. Atkinson, appointed for the purpose of collect-

    ing and suggestitig subjects for Chemical Research.

Before entering upon the task of forming a list of subjects, the members
of the Committee took opportunities of discussing the question privately
with other chemists, and found in many cases considerable doubts as to the

advisability of such a proceeding. Instead, therefore, of at once inviting
suggestions for research, the Committee considered it desirable to ascertain
the opinion of English chemists generally as to the feasibility of the proposed

scheme. The following Circular was accordingly sent to about fifty chemists,
who were either those of the highest oflicial standing, or who were known
to be engaged in research :

 --" Dear Sir, At the last Meeting of the British Association a Committee was

appointed, cousisting of Mr. Vernon Harcourt, Dr. Gladstone, and Dr. E. Atkinson,
with power to add to their number, to collect and suggest subjects for chemical

research.

  " When the matter was discussed by the Committee of the Chemical Section,

at whose instance the above-named Committee was appointed, it was thought that
a step might be taken towards the organization of chemical inquiry by the for-

mation aud publication of a list of subjects to be suggested by the leading chemists
of our own countrv, aud, if possible, of other countries also, from which younger
chemists wishing to undertake a research mii>kt select a subject with the assurance

that it wa^ considered new and important.

   " It was thought also that such a list, however meagre and inadequate it might
be at the outset, would t' nd to increase as soon as the plan became more widely
known, and might ultimately, if chemists of other countries were willing to taka

part, become an important feature in a general organization of chemical research.

  "A chemist undertaking the invcstii.-ation of any one of the suggested subjects

would send weird to the editors of the list, and might be placed in communi-

cation with the chemist by whom the subject was suggested. Each issue of the

list, which might be republished ai frequent intervals in some of the chemical
journals, would state which subjects had been already undertaken and by whom,

and thus the waste of labour wliich sometimes occurs through simultaneous work

on the .same subject would be prevented.

    " It has, however, been objected that chemists are not likely to be so prodigal of

their ideas as such a scheme supposes, aud may prefer keeping the subjects of
researcli which have suggested themselves to their minds for their own or their

pupils' investigation. The answer to this would seem to depend upon the answer

to the general question, whether the supply of ideas or suggestions for research

exi.stiug in the minds of the leading chemists at the present day does or does not

largely exceed the number of sldlled hands at theii' disposal.

" Before, therefore, proceeding to invite j'ou and others to suggest subjects to

be placed upon the proposed list, the Committee are desirous of learning whether

in your judgment the scheme is likely to succeed, and whether, if the attempt to

form such a list is made, you would be willing to contiibute to it ; they would also

be glad of any opinions in reference to the matter with which you may favour

them.

       We" are, dear Sir,

"P.S. Please address your answer. Dr. Atkinson, York Town, Surrey."

   To this Circular only eight written replies were received, of which four may

be classed as favourable, namely, those from Mr. Abel, President of the
Chemical Society, Prof. Mills, Mr. Bolas, and Mr. 11. Warington ; three
as adverse to the scheme, viz. from Dr. Joule, Mr. Hartley, and Mr. Groves,
the latter embodying the views of Dr. Stenhouse ; and one as doubtful from
Mr. Buckton.

   Among the objections raised to the proposed scheme perhaps the following

have been the most general :
   That suggestions for subjects of research would only be needed by, or be

useful to, students and beginners, and that such men would generally be under
the guidance of Professors, who would provide them with subjects ; that the
suggestion of a subject is generally its least part; that what students really want
is guidance and instruction in the art of investigation ; that any one who had
originality and power to make a satisfactory research would also be able to

find subjects for himself; that facilities and material appliances for research,
together with the means of living for those thus engaged, were more pressing
wants ; that any one contributing suggestions for research would reserve for

his own use the best of them, that is to say, those most likely to give im-

portant and satisfactory results.

   Of the letters received, the Committee may perhaps give the following from

Mr. Buckton and from Dr. Joule :

    " I believe that the result of chemical iiiquii'y would be greater and more

important in nature if the suggestions made Isy j-our Committee could be

efficiently carried out. I must confess, however, that my fears shape them-

selves very much after the fashion expressed by paragraph 5 of your Circular.

    " Original workers, I believe, always are under the hope that eventually
time and opportunity will present themselves, so that they wiU allow them
personally to work out their brightest and most promising ideas. If this be
so, but few of such will find a place in the contemplated list. Again, hesita-
tion might be felt amongst some lest the most promising subjects should
be negatived by the results of an inexperienced hand.

    " The number of skilled hands in our laboratories is certainly larger than
formerly, yet probably in this country latterly the harvest of original work
has not been in due proportion to this number.

    " If so, the steps proposed towards the organization of chemical inquiry by

way of a list will, I think, be beneficial.

                                                                                                     " G. B. BtrCKTON."

                                                                         " Manchester, May 4, 1876.

  We" know that the scientific faculty is of slow growth in the case of any

individual student. He becomes interested in a particular line of inquiry,

and in pursuing it becomes further interested by the acquisition of new facts.
The original inquiry will naturally ramify, and there will be a completeness
about his work and also an accuracy which could not be expected from that

done as it were to order. I think, too, that the mere suggestions of a research

may tend to make it unpalatable to many minds. We know that mere sug-

gestions have in some instances been claimed as discoveries. On this account
many would feel some delicacy in even suggesting an inquiry, necessarily

accompanied by the suggestion of the expected result, simply because it looks
like a forestalling to some extent of the merit of the actual labourer.

   "Then, in order to be in a position to suggest, a scientific man must have

mentally worked out the methods and anticipated the results of the proposed
train of investigation, and would doubtless prefer to work it out himself, or,
at any rate, to have the work done by his pupils under his immediate super-

--intendence first, because he naturally wishes that full justice should be done

to the subject from his own point of view ; and second, because he considers

himself to a certain extent in the light of a jiroprietor.
    " I do not think it desirable to use any extra stimulus to induce students

to work. If their own tastes and abilities and information do not lead them
to find a vein of knowledge and work it, the application of such stimulus

would probably result in the accumulation of incomplete and erroneous results
to the hindrance of real scientific advancement.

    In order that the proposed scheme should be successful it ought to meet
with very general support. This has been far from being the case, and there-
fore the Committee have not thought it advisable to proceed further in the

matter.

A CONVERSATION whicli I had with Professor Newcomb one evening last June, in

Professor Henry's drawing-room in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, has

forced me to give all my spare thoughts ever since to Hopkins's problem of Preces-

sion and Nutation, assuming the earth a rigid spheroidal shell filled with liquid.

Six weeks ago, when I landed in England after a most interesting trip to America
and back, and became painfully conscious that I must have the honour to address
you here today, I wished to wiite an Address of which science in America should
be the subject. I came home, indeed, vividly impressed with much that I had
seen both in the Great Exhibition of Philadelphia and out of it, showing the truest

scientific spirit and devotion, the originality, the inventiveness, the patient perseve-
ring thoroughness of work, the appreciativeness, and the generous open-mindedness
and sympathy, from which the gi-eat things of science come.

Can 1 go on to Precession and Nutation without a word of what I saw in the

Great Exhibition of Philadelphia ? In the U.S. Government part of it, Professor

Hilgard showed me the measuring-rods of the U.S. Coast Survey, with their beau-

tiful mechanical appliances for end measiu-ement, by whicli the three great base-

lines of Maine, Long Island, and Georgia were measured with about the same

accuracy as the most accurate scientific measurers, whether of Europe or America,

have attained in comparing two metre or yard measm'es.

In the United-States telegraphic department I saw and heard Elisha Gray's

splendidly worked-out Electric Telephone actually sounding four messages simul-

taneously on the Morse code, and clearly capable of doing yet four times as many

with very moderate improvements of detail ; and I saw Edison's Automatic Tele-

--graph delivering 1015 words in 57 seconds this done by the long-neglected

electro-chemical method of Bain, long ago condemned in England to the helot

work of recording from a relay, and then turned adrift as needlessly delicate for

that. In the Canadian Department I heard " To be or not to be                                there's the

rub,'' through an electric telegraph wire ; but, scorning monosyllables, the electric

--articulation rose to higher flights, and gave me passages taken at random from the

New- York newspapers : " S.S. ' Cox ' has arrived " (I failed to make out the S.S.

' Cox ') ; " the City of New York :" " Senator Morton ;" " The Senate has resolved to

print a thousand extra copies ;"' " The Americans in London have resolved to

celebrate the coming fourth of July." All this my own ears heard, spoken to me

with unmistakable distinctness by the thin circular disk armature of just such

another little electromagnet as this which I hold in ray hand. The words were

shouted with a clear and loud voice by my colleague-judge. Professor Watson, at

the far end of the telegraph-wire, holding his moiith close to a stretched membrane,

made to'perform in the neighbourhood of an electromagnet in circuit with the line

of all the marvels of the electric telegTaph, is due to a young countryman of our own,

Mr. Graham Bell, of Edinburgh and Montreal and Boston, now becoming a

Whonatmalized citizen of the United States.  can but admire the hardihood of

   The Patent Museum of Washington (an institution of which the nation is justly

proud) and the beneficent working of the LTuited-States patent laws deserve notice

in the Section of the British Association concerned with branches of science to

which nine tenths of all the useful patents of the world owe their foundations.

I was much struck Avith the prevalence of patented inventions in the Exhibition :

it seemed to me that every good thing deserving a patent was patented. I asked

one inventor of a very good invention, " Why don't you patent it in England? "
WeHe answered, " The conditions in England are too onerous."
                                                                                             certainly are far

behind America's wisdom in this respect. If Europe does not amend its patent

laws (England in the opposite direction to that proposed in the Bills before the

last two sessions of Parliament) America will speedily become the nursery of

useful inventions for the world.

I should tell you also of " Old Prob's " weather-waniings, which cost the nation

250,000 dollars a year: money well spent say the western fanners; and not they

alone                            in this the whole people of the United States are agreed ;  and though Demo-

man attracted into the United-States Naval Service), seen, for the first time in an

the 'Thunderer,' published while I am writing this address, forbids me to keep any

--such resolution, and compels me to put the question Is there in the British Navy,

or in a British steamer, or in a British land-boiler another safety-valve so con-

structed that by any possibility, at any temperatm'e or under any stress, it can jam ?

and to say that if there is, it must be instantly con-ected or removed.

I ought to speak to you, too, of the already venerable Harvard University, the

Cambridge of America, and of the Technological Institute of Boston, created by

William Rogers, brother of my late colleague in this University (Glasgow), Henry

Rogers, and of the Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore, which with its youthful

vigour has torn Sylvester from us, has utilized the genius and working-power of

Roland for experimental research, and three days after my arrival in America sent

for the young Porter  Poinier to  make  him a Fellow                                                                   but he was on his  deathbed,
                                                                                                                    ;

in New York, "begging his physicians to keep him alive just to finish his book,

and then he would be willing to go." Of his book, 'Thermodynamics,' we may

hope to see at least a part, for nuich of the manuscript and good and able

friends to edit it are left; but the appointment to a Fellowship in the Johns

Hopkins University came a day too late to gratify his noble ambition.

But the stimulus of intercourse with American scienfillc men left no place in

my mind for framing or attempting to frame a report on American science. Dis-

turbed by Newcomb's suspicions of the eirth's irregularities as a time-keeper, I

could think of nothing but precession and nutation, and tides and monsoons, and

settlements of the equitorial regions, and meltings of the polar ice. Week after

week passed before I could put down two words which I could read to you here

today ; and so I have nothing to ofler you for my Address but

Review of Evidence rer/ardinr/ the Ph)/sicfd Condition of the Earth: its internal
         Temperatii,re ; the Fluidity or SoUdit}/ of its interior Substance ; the
       Eic/idity, Elasticity, Plasticity, of its Eocterncd Figure ; and the Per-
       manence or Variability of its Period and Axis of Rotation.

   The evidence of a high internal temperature is too well known to need any quo-

tation of parliculars at present. Suthce it to say that below the uppermost ten
metres stratum of rock or soil sensibly affected by diurnal and annual variations of
temperature there is generally found a gradual increase of temperature downwards,
approxinrating roughly in ordinary localities to an average rate of 1° Centigrade

per thirty metres of descent, but much greater in the neighbourhood of active vol-

canoes and certain other special localities, of comparatively small area, where hot
springs and perhaps also sulphurous vapours prove an intimate relationship to vol-

canic quality. It is worthy of remark in passing that, so far as we know at present,

there are no localities of exceptionally small rate of augmentation of imderground
temperature, and none where temperature diminishes at any time through any con-
siderable depth downwards below the stratum sensibly influenced by summer heat

and winter cold. Any considerable area of the earth of, say, not less than a kilo-

metre in anv horizontal diameter, which for several thousand years had been covered
by snow or ice, and from which the ice had melted away and left an average surface
temperature of 13° Cent., would, during 9(J0 years, show a decreasing temperature
for some depth down from the surface ; and 3600 years after the clearing away of
the ice would .still show residual effect of the ancient cold, in a half rate of aug-
mentation of temperature downwards in the upper strata, gradually increasing to
the whole normal rate, which would be sensibly reached at a depth of 000 metres.

   By a simple effort of geological calculus it has been estimated that 1° j er -30

metres gives 1000° per .30,000 metres, and 333.3° per 100 kilometres. This aiith-
metical result is irrefragable ; but what of the physical conclusion drawn from it
4 REPORT 1876.

with marvellous frequency and pertinacity, that at depths of from 30 to 100 kilo-

metres the temperatures are so high as to melt all substances composing the earth's
upper crust ? It has been remarked, indeed, that if observation showed any dimi-
nution or augmentation of the rate of increase of underground temperature in great

depths, it would not be right to reckon on the uniform rate of 1 ° per 30 metres or
thereabouts down to 30 or 60 or 100 kilometres. " But observation has shown
nothinty of the kind ; and therefore surely it is most consonant with inductive philo-

soph}' to admit no great deviation in any part of the earth's solid crust fi-om the

rate of increase proved by observation as far as the greatest depths to which we
have reached ! " Now I have to remark upon this ai'gument that the gi-eatest depth

to which -we have reached in observations of underground temperature is scarcely
one kilometre ; and that if a 10-per-cent. diminution of the rate of augmentation of
underground temperature downwards were found at a deptli of one kilometre, this
would demonstrate * that within the last 100,000 years the upper siwface of the

earth must have been at a higher temperatui-e than that now found at the depth

of one kilometre. Such a result is no doubt to be found by observation in places

which have been overtiowu by lava in the memory of man or a few thousand

years further back ; but if, without going deeper than a kilometre, a 10-per-cent.

diminution of the rate of increase of temperature downwards were found for the

whole earth, it would limit the whole of geological history to witliin 100,000

years, or, at all events, would interpose an absolute barrier against the continuous

descent of life on the earth from earlier periods than 100,000 years ago. There-

fore, although search in particular localities for a diminution of the rate of aug-

mentation of underground temperature in depths of less than a kilometre may be

of intense interest, as helping us to fix the dates of extinct volcanic actions which

have taken place within 100,000 years or so, we know enough fiom tlioroughly sure

geological evidence not to expect to find it, except in particular localities, and to

feel quite sure that we shall not find it imder any considerable portion of the earth's
surface. If we admit as possible any such discontinuity within 900,000 years, we

might be prepared to find a sensible diminution of the rate at three kilometres

depth ; but not at any thing less than 30 kilometres if geologists validly claim as

much as 90,000,000 of years for the leng-th of the time with which their science is

Nowconcerned.  this implies a temperature of 1000° Cent, at the depth of 30 kilo-

metres, allows something less than 2000° for the temperature at 60 kilometres, and

does not require much more than 4000° Cent, at any depth however great, but does

require at the great depths a temperature of, at all events, not less than about 4000°

Cent. It would not take much " hurrying up " of the actions with which they are

concerned to satisfy geologists with the more moderate estimate of 60,000,000 of

years. This would imply at least about 3000° Cent, for the limiting temperature

at great de]ith8. If the actual substance of the earth, whatever it may be, rocky

or metallic, at depths of from 60 to 100 kilometres, under the pressure actually there

experienced by it, can be solid at temperatures of from 3000° to 4000°, then we

may hold the former estimate (90,000,000) to be as probable as the latter

(50,000,000), so far as evidence from undergi-ouud temperature can guide us. If

4000° would melt the earth's substance at a depth of 100 kilometres, we must reject
the former estimate though we might still admit the latter ; if 3000° would melt
the substance at a depth of 00 kilometres, we should be compelled to conclude that
50,000,000 of years is an over-estimate. Whatever may be its age, we may be

quite sure the earth is solid in its interior ; not, I admit, throughout its whole

volume, for there certainly are spaces in volcanic regions occupied by liquid lava
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but whatever portion of the whole mass is liquid, whether the waters of the ocean

or melted matter in the interior, these portions are small in comparison with the

whole ; and we must utterly reject any geological hypothesis which, whether for

explaining underground heat or ancient upheavals and subsidences of the solid

crust, or earthquakes, or existing volcanoes, assumes the solid earth to be a shell
of 30, or 100, or 50^, or 1000 kilometres thickness, resting on an interior liquid

mass.

   This conclusion was first arrived at by Hopkins, who may therefore properly be
called the discoverer of the earth's solidity. He was led to it by a consideration
of the phenomena of precession aiid nutation, and gave it as shown to be highly

probable, if not absolutely demonstrated, by his confessedly imperfect and tentative

investigation. But a rigorous application of the perfect hydrodynamical equations

leads still more decidedly to the same conclusion.

   I am able to say this to vou now in consequence of the conversation with Pro-
fessor Newcomb, to which 1 have already alluded. Admitting fully my evidence

for the rigidity of the earth from the tides, he doubted the argument from preces-

sion and nutation. Trying to recollect what I had written on it fourteen years

ago in a paper on the " Rigidity of the Earth," published in the Transactions of the

Royal Society, my conscience smote me, and I could only stammer out that I had

convinced myself that so-and-so and so-and-so, at which I had arrived by a non-

niathematieal short cut, were true. He hinted that viscosity might suffice to render

precession and nutation the same as if the earth were rigid, and so vitiate the
argument for rigidity. This I could not for a moment admit, any more than when

it was first put forward by Delaunay. But doubt entered my mind regarding the

so-and-so and so-and-so ; and I had not completed the night journey to Phila-

delphia which hurried me away from our unfinished discussion before I had con-
vinced myself that they were grievously wrong. So now I must request as a favour

that each one of you on going home will instantly turn up his or her copies of the
' Transactions of the Royal Society ' for 1862 and of Thomson and Tait's ' Natural

Philosophy,' vol. i., and di-aw the pen through §§ 2.5-31 of my paper on the

" Rigidity of the Earth " in the former, and through every thing in §§ 847, 848, 849

of the latter which refers to the effect on precession and nutation of an elastic

yielding of the earth's surface.

  When those passages were written I knew little or nothing of vortex motion ; and
until my attention was recalled to them by Professor Newcomb I had never once

thought of this subject in the light thro\vn upon it by the theor}^ of the quasi-

rigidity induced in a liquid by vortex motion, which has of late occupied me so

much. With this fresh light a little consideration sufficed to show me that

(although the old obvious conclusion is of course true, that, if the inner boundary

of the imagined rigid shell of the earth were rigorously spherical, the interior liquid

could experience no precessional or nutational influence from the pressure on its

bounding surface, and therefore if homogeneous could have no precession or nuta-

tion at all, or if heterogeneous only as much precession and nutation as woidd be

produced by attraction from without in virtue of non-sphericity of its surfaces of

--equal density, and therefore the shell woidd have enormously more rapid precession

and nutation than it actually has forty times as much, for instance, if the thickness

of the shell is 60 Irilometres) a very slight deviation of the inner surface of the shell

from perfect sphericity would suffice, in virtue of the quasi- rigidity due to vortex

motion, to hold back the shell from taking sensibly more precession than it would

g-ive to the liquid, and to cause the liquid (homogeneous or heterogeneous) and the

shell to have sensibly the same precessional motion as if the whole constituted one

rigid^body. But it is only because of the very long period (26,000 years) of pre-

cession, in comparison with the period of rotation (one day), that a very slight

deviation from sphericity would suffice to cause the whole to move as if it were a

Arigid body.  little further consideration showed me :

(1) That an elHpticity of inner surface equal to        ---- would be too small,

but that an ellipticity of one or two hundred times this amount would not be too
small to compel approximate equality of precession throughout liquid and shell.

   (2) That with an ellipticity of interior surface equal to y^Q, if the precessional
motion were 26,000 times as great as it is, the motion of the liquid would be very
different from that of a rigid mass rigidly connected with the shell.

(3)  That with  the  actual forces  and the  supposed interior  ^,ellipticity of  the

lunar uineteen-yearly nutation might be affected to about five per cent, of its

amount by interior liquidity.
6 REPORT 1876.

   (4) Lastly, that the lunar semiannual nutation must he largely, and the lunar
fortnightly nutation enormously affected by interior liquidity.

But although so much could be foreseen readily enough, I found it impossible

to discover without thorough mathematical investigation what might be the cha-

racters and amounts of the deviations from a rigid body's motion which the several

cases of precession and nutation contemplated would present. The investigation,

limited to the case of a homogeneous liquid enclosed in an ellipsoidal shell, has

brought out results which I confess have greatly surprised me. When the interior

ellipticity of the .shell is just too small, or the periodic speed of the distiu bance j ust

too great to allow the motion of the whole to be sensibly that of a rigid body, the

deviation first sensible renders the processional or nutational motion of the shell

smaller thau if the whole were rigid, instead of greater, as I expected. The amount

of this difference bears the same proportion to the actual precession or nutation as

the fraction measining the periodic -speed of the disturbance (in terms of the period

of rotation as unity) bears to the fraction measuring the interior ellipticity of the

shell; and it is remarkable that this result is independent of the thickness of the

shell, assumed, however, to be small in proportion to the earth's radius. Thus in

the case of precession the eflect of interior liquidity would be to diminish the periodic

speed of the precession in the proportion stated ; 'in other words, it would add to

the precessional period a number of days equal to the multiple of tlie rotational

period equal to the number whose reciprocal measures the ellipticity. Thus, in the

--actual case of the earth, if we still take  as the ellipticity of the inner boundary

of the supposed rigid shell, the effect would be to augment by 800 days the pre-
cessional period of 2G00 years, or to diminish by about - the annual precession

of about 51", an effect which I need not say would be wholly insensible. But on
the hmar nutation of 18'6 years period, the effect of interior liquidity would be
quite sensible; 18-6 years being twenty- three times 300 days, the eflect would be
to diminish the axes of the ellipse which the earth's pole desciibes in this period

each by gg of its own amount. The semiaxes of this ellipse, calculated on the
theory of perfect rigidity from the very accurately known amount of precession,
and the fairly accurate knowledge which we have of the ratio of the lunar to the

solar part of the precessional luotion, are 9"-22 and 6"'86, -n-ith an uncertainty not
amounting to one half per cent, on account of want of perfect accuracy in the latter

^part of data. If the true values were less each by of its own amount, the dis-

crepance  might  have  escaped  detection, or might not have escaped detection                                                                                                                                                                            but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

certainly could be found if looked for. So far nothing can be considered as abso-

lutely proved with reference to the interior solidity of the earth from precession

and nutation ; but now think of the solar semiannual and the lunar fortnightly

Nownutations. The period of each of these is less than -'jOO days.                                                                           the hydro-

dynamical theory shows that, in-espectively of the thickness of the shell, the nuta-

tion of the crust would be zero if the period of the nutational disturbance were

300 times the period of rotation (the ellipticity being .^) ; if the nutational period

were any thing between this and a certain smaller critical value depending on the
thickness of the crust, the nutation would be negative ; if the period were equal to
this second critical value, the nutation would be infinite ; and if the period were
still less, the nutation would be again positive. Further, the 183 days period of
the solar nutation falls so little short of the critical SCO days that the amount
of the nutation is not sensibly influenced by the thickness of the crust, is negative

^and equal in absolute value to  (being the reciprocal of js^-- 1) times what

the amount would be were the earth solid throughout. Now this amount, as

calculated in the 'Nautical Almanac,' makes 0"-55 and 0"'51 the semiaxes of the

ellipse traced by the earth's axis round  its mean position                                                                                  and if the true nutation
                                                                                                                                          ;

placed the earth's axis on the opposite side of an ellipse, having 0"-86 and 0"-81 for

its .semiaxes, the discrepance could not possibly have escaped detection. But, lastly,

^think of the lunar fortnightly nutation. Its period is                                                                                      of 300 days, and its

amount, calculated in the ' Nautical Almanac ' on the thee ry of complete solidity, is
                                                                                    :

Such that the "fi-eatpr semiaxis of the approximately circular ellipse described by the
pole is 0"0325. AVere the crust infinitely thin this nutation would be negative, but

its amount nineteen times that corresponding to solidity. This would make the

greater semiaxis of the approximately circular ellipse described by the pole amomit

to 19x0""0885, which is 1""7. It would be negative and of some amount between
1"'7 and infinity, if the thickness of the crust were any thing li'om zero to 120 kilo-

metres. This conclusion is absolutely decisive against the geological hypothesis of

a thin rigid shell full of liquid.

But interesting in a dynamical point of view as Hopkins's problem is, it can-

not afford a decisive argument against the earth's interior liquidity. It assumes

the crust to be perfectly stifi' and unj'ielding in its figure. This, of course, it cannot

be, because no material is infinitely rigid ; but, composed of rock and possibly of

continuous metal in the great depths, may the crust not, as a whole, be stiff enough

to practically fulfil the condition of unyieldingness ? No, decidedly it coidd not

on the contrary, were it of continuous steel and 500 kilometres thick, it would

yield very nearly as much as if it were india-rubber to the deforming influences of

Nowcentrifugal force and of the sun's and moon's attractions.  although the full

problem of precession and nutation, and, what is now necessarily included in it,

tides, in a continuous revolving liqiud spheroid, whether homogeneous or hetero-

geneous, has not yet been coherently worked out, 1 thinli I see far enough towards

a complete solution to say that precession and nutations will be practically the

same in it as in a solid globe, and that the tides will be practically the same as

those of the equilibrium theory. From this it follows that precession and nuta-

tions of the solid crust, with the practically perfect flexibilitj^ which it would have

even though it were 100 kilometres thick and as stifi' as steel, would be sensibly

the same as if the whole earth from surface to centre were solid and perfectly stiff',
Hence precession and nutations yield nothing to be said against such hypotheses

as that of Uarwiu*, that the earth as a whole takes approximately the figure due to

gi-avity and centrifugal force, because of the fluidity of the interior and the flexi-
bility of the crust. But, alas for this " attractive sensational idea that a molten

interior to the globe underlies a superficial crust, its surface agitated by tidal

waves, and flowing freely towards any issue that may here and there be opened for

its outward escape " (as Poulett Scrope called it) ! the solid crust would yield so
freely to the deforming influence of sun and moon that it would simply carry the
waters of the ocean up and down with it, and there would be no sensible tidal

rise and fall of water relatively to laud.

 --The state of the case is shortly this : The hypothesis of a perfectly rigid crust

containing Hquid violates physics by assrmiing preternaturally rigid matter, and

violates dynamical astronomy in the solar semiannual and lunar fortnightly nuta-

tions ; but tidal theory has nothing to say against it. On the other hand, the tides

decide against any crust flexible enough to perform the nutations correctly with

a liquid interior, or as flexible as the crust must be unless of preternaturally rigid

matter.

   But now thrice to slay the slain : suppose the earth this moment to be a thin

crust of rock or metal resting on liquid matter ; its equilibrium would be unstable !

And what of the upheavals and subsidences ? They would be strikingly analogous

--to those of a ship which has been rammed one portion of crust up and another

down, and then all down. I maj' say, with almost perfect certainty, that whatever

may bo the relative densities of rock, solid and melted, at or about the temperature

of liquefaction, it is, I think, quite certain that cold solid rock is denser than hot

melted rock ; and no possible degree of rigidity in the crust could prevent it from
breaking in pieces and sinking wholly below the liquid lava. Something like this

--may have gone on, and probably did go on, for thousands of years after solidifica-

tion commenced surface-portions of the melted material losing heat, freezing,
sinking immediately, or gTowing to thicknesses of a few metres, when the surface
would be cool and the whole solid dense enough to sink. " This process must go

on until the sunk portions of crust build up from the bottom a sufficiently close-

ribbed skeleton or frame to allow fresh incrustations to remain, bridging across

the now small areas of lava pools or lakes.

   " In the honeycombed solid and liquid mass thus formed there must be a con-
tinual tendency for the liquid, in consequence of its less specitic gravity, to work

its way up ; whether by masses of solid falling from the roofs of vesicles or tunnels
and causing earthquake-shocks, or by the roof breaking quite through when very
thin, so as to cause two such hollows to unite or the liquid of any of them to flow

out freely over the outer surface of the earth, or by gradual subsidence of the solid
owing to the thermodynamic melting which portions of it under intense stress

must experience, according to my brother's theory. The results which must follow
from this tendency seem sufficiently great and various to account for all that we

learn from geological evidence of earthquakes, of upheavals and subsidences of

solid, and of eruptions of melted rock."*

Leaving altogether now the hypothesis of a hollow shell filled with liquid, we

must still face the question, how much does the earth, solid throughout, except

small cavities or vesicles filled with liquid, yield to the deforming (or tide-gene-

rating) influences of sun and moon ? This question can only be answered by obser-

Avation.  single infinitely accurate spirit-level or plummet far enough away from

the sea to be not sensibly affected by the attraction of the rising and falling water

would enable us to find the answer. Observe by level or plummet the changes of

direction of apparent gravity relatively to an object rigidly connected with the

earth, and compare these changes with what they would be were the earth perfectly

rigid, according to the kno'WTi masses and distances of sun and moon. The dis-

crepance, if any is found, wo idd show distortion of the earth, and would afford data

for determining the dimensions of the elliptic spheroid into which a non-rotating

globular mass of the same dimensions and elasticity as the earth woidd be distorted

by centrifugal force if set in rotation, or by tide- generating influences of sun or

moon. The effect on the plumb-line of the lunar tide-generating influence is to

deflect it towards or from the point of the horizon nearest to the moon, according

as the moon is above or below the horizon. The effect is zero when the moon is

on the horizon or overhead, and is greatest in either direction when the moon is

46° above or below the horizon. "VVheu this greatest value is reached, the plummet

is drawn from its mean position through a space equal to  ., f.(,n nnn  ^^ ^^® length of

the thread. No ordinary plummet or spirit-level could give any perceptible indication

whatever of this effect ; and to measm-e its amount it would be necessary to be able

to observe angles as small as ivp qqo ooo °^ ^^^ radian, or about -g^". Siemens's

beautiful hydrostatical multiplying level may probably supply the means for doing-

this. Otherwise at present no apparatus exists within small compass by which it

Acould be done.  submerged water-pipe of considerable length, say 12 kilometres,

with its two ends turned up and open, might answer. Suppose, for example, the

tube to lie north and south, and its two ends to open into two small cisterns, one

of them, the southern for example, of half a decimetre diameter (to escape disturb-

ance from capillary attraction), and the other of two or three decimetres diameter

(so as to throw nearly the whole rise and fall into the smaller cistern). For sim-

plicity, suppose the time of observation to be when the moon's declination is zero.

The water in the smaller or southern cistern will rise from its lowest position to
its highest position while the moon is rising to maximum altitude, and fall again

after the moon crosses the meridian till she sets ; and it will rise and fall again

through the same range from moouset to moonrise. If the earth were perfectly

rigid, and if the locality is in latitude 45°, the rise and fall would be half a milli-

metre on each side of the mean level, or a little short of half a millimetre if the

place is within 10° north or south of latitude 45°. If the air were so absolutely

qiuescent during the observations as to give no varying differential pressure on

the two water-surfaces to the amount of -j^g millimetre of water or ^ f\g of mer-
cury, the observation would be satisfactorily practicable, as it wotild not be difficult

by aid of a microscope to observe the rise and fall of the water in the smaller cistern

to -i}ff of a millimetre ; but no such quiescence of the atmosphere could be expected

at any time                                             and it is probable that the variations of the water-level due to diflerence

of the barometric pressure at the two" ends would, in all ordinary weather, quite

overpower the small effect of the lunar tide-generating- motive. If, however, the

two cisterns, instead of being open to the atmosphere, were connected air-tightly

by a return-pipe with no water in it, it is probable that the observation might be

successfully made : but Sieniens's level or some other apparatus on a similarly small

scale would probably be preferable to any elaborate method of obtaining the result

by aid of verj' long pipes laid in the ground ; and I have only called your attention
to such an ideal method as leading up to the natural phenomenon of tides.

Tides in an open canal or lake of 12 kilometres length would be of just the

amount which we have estimated for the cisterns connected by submerged pipe

but would be enormously more disturbed by wind and variations of atmospheric

Apressure.                                              canal or lake of 240 kilometres length in a proper direction and in a

suitable locality would give but 10 millimetres rise and fall at each end, an efl'ect

which might probably be .analyzed out of the much greater disturbance produced

by wind and ditlerences of barometric pressure ; but no open liquid level short

of the vngens cpqitor, the ocean, will probably be found so well adapted as it

for measuring the absolute value of the disturbance produced on terrestrial

gravity by the lunar and solar tide-generating motive. But observations of the

diurnal and semidiurnal tides in the ocean do not (as they would on smaller

and quicker levels) suffice for this purpose, because their amounts difter enor-

mously from the equilibrium-values on account of the smallness of their periods

in comparison with the periods of any of the grave enough modes of fi-ee

vibration of the ocean as a whole. On the other hand, the lunar fort-

nightly declinational and the lunar monthly elliptic and the solar semiannual

and annual elliptic tides have their periods so long that their amounts

must certainly be very approximately equal to the equilibrium-values. But there

are large annual and semiannual changes of sea-level, probably both diflerential

(on account of wind and differences of barometric pressm-e and differences of

temperature of the water) and absolute, depending on rainfall and the melting

away of snow and return evaporation, which altogether swamp the small semi-

annual and .inuual tides due to the sun's attraction. Happily, however, for our

object there is no meteorological or other disturbing cause which produces periodic

changes of sea-level in either the fortnightly declinational or the monthly elliptic

period ; and the lunar gravitational tides in these periods are therefore to be care-

fully investigated in order that we may obtain the answer to the interesting ques-

tion, how much does the earth as an elastic spheroid yield to the tide-generating

influence of sun or moon.' Hitherto in the British-Association Committee's

reductions of Tidal Observations we have not succeeded in obtaining any trust-

worthy indications of either of these tides. The St.-George's pier landing-stage

pontoon, unhappily chosen for the Liverpool tide-gauge, cannot be trusted for such

a delicate investigation : the available funds for calculation were expended before

the long-period tides for Ililbre Island could be attacked, and three years of Ivur-

rachee gave our only approach to a result. Comparisons of this with an indication

of a result of calculations on West Hartlepool tides, conducted with the assist-

ance of a grant from the Royal Society, seem to show possibly no sensible yield-

ing, or perliaps more probably some degree of yielding, of the earth's figm-e. The

absence from all the results of any indication of a 186 jearly tide (according to

the same law as the other long-period tides) is not easily explained without

assuming or admitting a considerable degree of yielding.

Closely connected with the question of the earth's rigidity, and of as great scien-

tific interest and of even gi-eater practical moment, is the question, llow nearly

accurate is the earth as a timekeeper ? and another of, at all e\ents, equal scientific

Howinterest.                                            about the permanence of the earth's axis of rotation ?

   Peters and Maxwell, about 35 and 25 years ago, separately raised the question,

How much does the eai-th's axis of rotation debate from being a principal .axis of

inertia ? and pointed out that an answer to this question is to be obtained by

looking for a variation in latitude of any or everv place on the earth's surface in u

1870.                                                                                                           2

period of 306 days. The model before you illustrates the travelling round of the

instantaneous axis relatively to the earth in an approximately circular cone whose

axis is the principal axis of inertia, and relatively to space in a couo round a fixed

axis. In the model the former of these cones, fixed relatively to the earth, rolls

internally on the latter, supposed to be fixed in space. Peters gave a minute investiga-

tion of observations at Pulkovain the years 1841-42, which seem to indicate at that

time a deviation amounting to about -^y of the axis of rotation from the principal

axis. Maxwell, from Greenwich observations of the years 1851-54, found seeming

indications of a very slight deviation, something less than half a second, but differ-

ing altogether in phase from that which the deviation indicated by Peters, if real

and permanent, would have produced at Maxwell's later time. On my begging

Professor Newcomb to take up the subject, he Mndly did so at once, and undertook

to analyze a series of observations suitable for the purpose which had been made in

Athe United-States Naval Observatory, '\^'ashingtoll.               few weelcs later I received

from him a letter refeiTing me to a paper by l)r. Nysen, of Pulkova Observatory,

in which a similar negative conclusion as to constancy of magnitude or direction

in the deviation sought for is arrived at from several series of the Pulkova obser-

--vations between the years 1842 and 1872, and containing the_following statement

of his conclusions :

" The investigation of the ten-month period of latitude from the Washington

prime vertical observations from 18G2 to 1867 is completed, indicating a coeflicient

too small to be measured with certainty. The declinations with this instrument

are subject to an annual period which made it necessary to discuss those of each

month separately. As the series extended through a full five years, each month

thus fell on five nearly equidistant points of the period. If :v and i/ represent the

coordinates of the axis of instantaneous rotation on June 30, 1864, then the obser-

--vations of the separate months give the following values of x and i/:

((     Accepting  these  results  as  real,  they  would  indicate  a  radius   of  rotation  of the
    '

instantaneous axis amounting, at the earth's .surface, to 5 feet and a longitude of

the point in which this axis intersects the earth's surface near the North Pole, such

that on July 11, 18G4, it was ISO^ fi-om Washington, or 103° east of Greenwich.

The excess of the coefficient over its probable error is so slight that this result

cannot be accepted as any thing more than a consequence of the unavoidable

errors of observation."

From the discordant character of these results we must not, however, infer that

the deviations indicated by Peters, Maxwell, and Newcomb are unreal. On the

contrary, any that fall within the limits of probable error of the observations ought

properly to be regarded as real. There is, in fact, a vera causa in the temporary

changes of sea-level_ due to meteorological causes, chiefly Aviuds, and to meltings of

ice in the polar regions and retm-n evaporations, whicli seems amply sufficient to

account for irregular deviations of from i" to J^" of the earth's instantaneous axis

from the axis of maximum inertia, or, as I ought rather to say, of the axis of
maximum inertia from the instantaneous axis.

As for geological upheavals and subsidences, if on a very large scale of area,

they must produce, on tlie period and axis of the earth's rotation, eHeets compai-able

with those produced bv chanffes of sea-level equal to them in vertical amount.

For simplicity, calculating as if the earth were of equal density throughout, I find

that an upheaval of all the earth's surface in north latitude and east longitude and

south ktitudo and west longitude with equal depression in the other two quarters,

amounting at greatest to ten centimetres, and graduating regularly from the points

of maximum elevation to the points of maximum depression in themiddles of the

four quarters, would shift the earth's axis of maximum moment of inertia through

] " on the north side towards the meridian of 90° W. longitude, and on the south

side towards the meridian of 90° E. longitude. If such a change were to take

])lace suddeulv, the earth's instantaneous axis would experience a sudden shifting of

but -r^g" (which we nnxy neglect), and then, relatively to the earth, would com-

mence travelling, in a period of 30(3 days, round the fresh axis of maximum moment

of inertia. The sea would be set into vibration, one ocean up and aiiother down

through a few centimetres, like water in a bath set aswing. The period of these

Adbratlons  would  be  from 12  to  2-4 hours,  or at  most  a  day or  two                       their  subsidence
                                                                                               ;

would probably be so rapid that after at most a few months they would become

insensible. Then a regular 306-days period tide of 11 centimetres from lowest

to highest woidd be to be observed, with gradually dimiuishiug amount from

century to centurv, as through the dissipation of energy produced by this tide

tlie instantaneous" axis of the earth is gradually brought into coincidence with

the fresh axis of maximum moment of inertia. " If we multiply these figures by

3600, we find what would be the result of a similar sudden upheaval and sub-

.sidence of the earth to the extent of 360 metres above and below previous levels.

It is not impossible that in the very early ages of geological history such an

action as this, and the consequent 400-metres tide producing a succession of deluges

every 306 days for many years, may have taken place ; but it seems more pro-

bable that even in the most ancient" times of geological history the great world-

wide changes, such as the upheavals of the continents and subsidences of the oceau-

l)eds from'the general level of their supposed molten origin, took place gradually

through the thermodynainic melting of solids and the squeezing out of liquid
Alava from the interior, to which I have ah'eady referred.
                                                                        slow distortion of

the earth as a whole would never produce any great angular separation between

the instantaneous axis and axis of maximum moment of inertia for the time being.

Considering, then, the great facts of the Himalayas and Andes, and Africa and the

depths of the Atlantic, and America and the depths of the Pacific, and Austi-ali.a,

and considering further the ellipticity of the equatorial section of the sea-level esti-

mated by Capt. Clarke at about ^V" of the mean ellipticity of meridional sections

of the sea-level, we need no brush from the comet's tail (a Avholly cliimerical cause

which can never have been put forward seriously except in ignorance of elementary
dynamical principles) to account for a change in the earth's axis ; we need no violent

convulsion producing a sudden distortion on a great scale, with change of the axis

of maximum moment of inertia followed by gigantic deluges : and we may not
merely admit, but assert as highly probable, that the axis of maximum inertia and
axis of rotation, always very near one another, may have been in ancient times

very far from their present geographical position, and may have gradually shifted

through 10, 20, 30, 40, or more degrees without at any time any perceptible sudden

disturbance of either laud or water.

   Lastlv, as to variations in the earth's rotational period. You all no doubt know

how, in" 1853, Adams discovered a correction to be needed in the theoretical calcu-

lation with which Laplace followed up his brilliant discovery of the dynamical
explanation of an apjiarent acceleration of the moon's mean motion shown by

records of ancient eclipses, and how he found that when his correction was

applied the dynamical theory of the moon's motion accounted for only about half

of the observed apparent acceleration, and how Delaimay in 1866 verified Adams's
result and suggested that the explanation may be a retardation of the earth's rota-

tion bv tidal friction. The conclusion is that, since the 10th of March, 721 n.c, a
day on which an eclipse of the moon was seen in Babylon, commencing " when one

hour after her rising was fully passed," the earth has lost rather more than
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        j;;];j^j;;oo(j

annum now than tlien. According to this rate of retardation, if uniform, tlie

earth at the end of a century would, as a timekeeper, he found 22 seconds behind

a_ perfect clock, rated and set to agree with her at the beginning of the century.

Newcomb's subsequent investigations in the lunar theory have on the whole tended

to confirm this result ; but they have also brought to light some remarkable ap-

parent irregularities in the moon's motion, wliich, if real, refuse to be accounted

for by the gTavitational theory without the influence of some unseen body or bodies

passing near enough to the moon to influence her mean motion. This hypothesis
Newcomb considers not so probable as that the apparent irregidarities of the moon

are not real, ajid are to be accounted for by irregularities in the earth's rotational

\elocity. If this is the true explanation, it seems that the earth was going slow

from 1850 to 1862, so much as to have got behind by seven seconds in these twelve

years, and then to have begun going fester again so as to gain eight seconds from

1802 to 1872. So great an irregularity as this woxdd require somewhat greater

changes of sea-level, but not many times greater than the British Association

Committee's reductions of tidal observations for several places in dift'erent parts of

the world allow us to admit to have possibly talcen place. The assumption of a
fluid interior, wliich Newcomb suggests, and the flow of a large mass of the fluid

''from equatorial regions to a position nearer tlie axis," is not, from what I liave

said to j'ou, admissible as a probable explanation of tlie remarkable acceleration of

rotational velocity which seems to have taken place about 1862 ; but happily it is

               0)1 Graplilcal Interpolation and Integration.

By George H. Daeavix, M.A., Fellow of Trin. Coll., Cambridge.

Suppose a number of points A, B, C, &e. are given on equidistant ordiuates of a

cur^'e, and that it is desired to draw a curve tlircugh them. This ma}^ be best

done by interpolating intermediate points. I^et a, b, c, &c. bj ordinates halfway

Abetween and B, B and C, &c. Join AB, BC, &c. along the whole curve, and let

the ordinates a, b, c, &c. intersect AB, BC, CD, &c. in/, (/, h, &e. Join AC, BD,

CE, &c., and so on along the whole curve, and lot the ordinates B, C, D, &c. inter-

sect AC, BD, CE, &c. in F, G, II, &c. Then the rule for interpolating on the

-- = BFordinates a, b, c, &c. is: produce afto I, and make// \      produce bg to m,

                                                                  ;

=and make gin 5 CG, and so on. In carrying this out practically, several of the

above lines need not actually be drawn.

This rule may be proved from the properties of the circle of curvature, which

passes through three consecutive points, such as A, B, C. It gives results correct

Aas far as second differences.  slightly different result will be obtained by working

along the curve in the opposite direction : to obtain a better result work both ways

along the curve, and choose the points which lie halfway between the discrepant

readings. The residt so given is correct as far as third diffei'ences.

In determining the approximate value of a definite integral it is often convenient

to find a geometrical construction for giving a line proportional to the function to

be integrated, and then to determine half a dozen values of the function. But the

question then arises as to how these terms are to be combined, so as to give the

--required integral whether by the rules given by the calculus of finite differences,

or by the simpler rule of taking the mean of the extremes and adding it together

with all the rest, and multiplying by the common difference. Each ordinate or
term is affected by an error, and it may be that the theoreticaUy best rule may give

a higher probable error to the result than the more imperfect rule. If, for example,

we have seven ordinates, each subject to a probable error c, Weddle's rule (see

Boole's Calc. Fin. Diff.) would give a result subject to a probable error 2-846 he,

whilst the worse rule only gives a probable error 2-.34o he, where h is the common

difference. It must therefore remain indeterminate whether more is gained by a

diminished probable error or by a better rule of quadratures. The question could

only be determined by some knowledge of the amount of probable en'or of each

ordinate, and of the abruptness of the curvature of tlio curve*.

   1. The classification of class-ciibics is simpler than of plane orcler-cubics, because
there are three real foci in each of the former, -whereas two of the asymptotes of

order-cubics may be imaginary.

  mThe three groups, arranged by the coincidence of the foci, have been stated

the Transactions for 1875, and the third group of spherical curves there sketched.

=This group (K}f    q)  has  been  also   fully  considered  in  the 'Quarterly Journal of
                                                                                                                                                                                               _

by interpreting Boothian as Cartesian coordinates.
 "2. In the classification of the second group {Kp-q=r) the two foci will be con-

sidered fixed, -while the satellite-point varies. There is a certain quartic curve, the

locus of tlie satellite-point, when there is a point of inflexion in the curve; if the

satellite-point is  within  this  curve,  there -will be  three  critic  linos  ov bitangents                                                     if

it be on the curve, there will be one bitan<j-eut and two otlicrs coinciding in a sta-

tionary tangent ; if it fall beyond the bounding cuiTe, only one bitaugent is possible.

The critic lines or bitangents are the common tangents of three parabola, whoso
Whenfoci are severally the satellite-point and the two foci of the cubic.
                                                                                these

parabolre are drawn, the bitangents are obtained graphically.

The several cases of cubics o'f this group -will be next considered, according to the

position of the satellite with reference to the bounding curve -while all three points

are finite ; and subscc^uently, when the satellite-point and tlie.foci are, one or more,

at infinity ; also when the three points are collinear.

3. The gi'oup may be thus represented :

                                   =K2yq-{-4-A'r Q,

where 'i£^-=a})V+bqQ,+cr'R; p, q, r are the current line coordinates, and F=(ip--

B Rhq cos C-c;- cos : Q, have like values for points at infinity, as the quadrantal

poles of the sides of ABC.

   There are usually three critic lines, whose eq^uation.s are obtained by partial

differentiation :

                    apV = A^\l) : bqQ=2A-{2) : crPt=-2A-(3).

  = =Since the condition p q r satisfies all these equations, the critic lines must

touch three parabolse, whose foci are the vertices and whose axes are the perpen-
diculars drawn on the sides of the triangle of reference, and, httera recta, arc four
times, twice, and six times its corresponding altitudes.

   There are three of these critic lines, one of which is always real.
   4. The Cartesian equation to the bounding ciu've (§ 2), or locus of the satellite-
point, when there are stationary points in this group of class-cubics, is

    =273/''-!-9i/'(2+4a;-f5.r')-fy^(l-l-a;)-(-l-10.r+9a;-)-.i--(l-f9a')(l+.r)^' 0,

or

                 {27z/'+I8/(x'-Hl)-(9.c-M)(.r+l)'}(y-+'") = 0-

The double focus is the origin, and the focal distance on the x axis is taken as

unity ; a pair of asymptotes is inclined to the diameter at angles +30°.

   The envelop of the stationary tangent is a hyperbola, and of the single (one-
-vvith-twofold) bitangent is a cubic of division V., whose double focus is at in-

finity.

18 REPORT--187G.

    Let the cubic be tbus denoted :

The critical Talue (k=5-145S) determines the bitangeutial cubic. The cubic is

=bipartite or unipartite, according as /ci^<;5"1458 ; equiharmonicif k 1"()7 or --"17;
--harmonic if k= -lo.

   There may be two real asymptotes, since there is one bitangent in this division.
   II. When the satellite-point is on the bounding sextic.

    In this case there are two critical values of the parameter, corresponding to the
bitangential and inflexional cubics, viz. 11-09 and -08. The curve is bipartite if

/c>ll-09.

    III. AMien the satellite is inside the quartic, and is (1) not collinear, and (2) is
collinear with the foci.

   =(1) There are three bitangents when /c 47, 'O?, 'OG. For higher values of k,

the curve is bipartite ; between 47 and '07, unipartite ; then bipartite and below
the bitangential curve unipartite.

   There may be four asjauptotes.

    (2) Let the cubic be thus denoted :

   There are two bitangents with real and imaginary contact, as is thus shown :
                                    4+A(27e=-18Jc-62)+4X^i^c=0.

   For the inflexional genus, the discriminant gives the condition

This may be resolved into two factors :

                                                   (h-c) (b-dcf.

The first factor resolves the cubic into a point and a circle ; tlie second factor indir

cates the cissoid

                                         (3+hiy+u\9+bi),j'=o.

   The satellite-point in this case is the ap.?e in the quartic bounding curve.
   IV. If the satellite-point be at infinity (1) not collinear, (2) collinear, with the
two foci.
   (1) There are two bitangential or a single inflexional, or no bitangential form,
according as the satellite lies within, upon, or beyond the quartic curve. One
asymptote connects the double focus with the satellite ; the other three concur in

=the point (^ |); the polar conic of the line at infinity degenerates into these

points.

   (2) There may be two asymptotes, which unite in a bitangent, for a special value

of the parameter.
    V. If the double focus is at infinity, (1) not collinear, (2) collinear with tlie

single focus and satellite-point.
   The cubic has in all cases a bitangent ; find for a particular value of the para-

meter two bitangents coincide in a stationary tangent at a point of inflexion. The

inflexional cubic in (2) is the semicubical parabola.
   YI. If the single focus is at infinity (I) not collinear, (2) collinear with the

double focus and satellite.
   There are two bitangential forms, but no inflexional case. The recijirocals in (2)

are Newton's defective hyperbola;, with diameters and double foci.
    \T.I. If the single focus and satellite-point are both at infinity.
   The curve is central and parabolic, with a cusp at infinity, but cannot have a

bitangent. Its single asymptote connects the double focus with the satellite. All
cubics are equiharmonic of the form

   It is thus denoted in Boothian coordinates :

The reciprocal is Newton's central species (?>8)

   VIII. If the double focus and satellite-poiut arc both at iufinity.
   There is au iuflt-xional forui iu all cases, as appears from the equation lo the
svstem :

The reciprocal is a cusped cubic.
   IX. If the double and single focus are both <at infinity.
   Tlie lino at infinity is an acii-bi tangent in all cases, as is shown by the ec[uation

to the system :

G. To find the asymptotes of this group of class-cubics.

   Since the polar-point of au asymptote (p, q, r) lies on it, and also is at an infinite
distance, the coordinates of an asymptote must satisfy two equations :

                 =(^ X/(?+4AV=0,                                         (1)

and that to the polar conic of the line at infinity

one of whose foci, as we should anticipate, is the double focus.     Hence also

  The four asymptotes touch a conic, whose foci are p=0, =2q-\-p 0.                  (3)

                                r{2q+p)=pq

The elimination of r from (2) and (.3) is a quartic equation. Hence there cannot

be more than four asyniptotes. Its discriminant is a factor of the discriminant of

the ternary cubic (1). Two imaginary asymptotes always connect the double focus

with tlie circular points at infinity.

   If the satellite (which is always on the curve) be at infinity, its connector with

the double focus is au asjnnptote. The extremities of two asymptotes may coincide

in a bitaugent.

7. The centre or polar point of the line at infinity is on AB, the connector of the

AB ACfoci, at the distance ^                              touches the cubic in C
                 from A, the double focus.                                                                                                                           ;

BC touches it where it meets the line {^--Ky=0).

--1. This group may be denoted by line coordinates, as in platw :

where                   ^p'q+(G\yr=0,
                 (GYy-=2(aY--2bcqr cos A),

and the coordinates p, q, r denote the sines of the perpendiculars from the vertices

ABC on a tangent arc ; and generally the symbols may denote the sines of arcs.

   There are four critic values of the parameter and fom- bitaugential values. By

partial differentiation, for a critic value,

                   2Kpq+2raV = : Kp'+2rbq=0 : (Q\)-+2rcU=0,

where F = ap--bq cos G-cr cos B ; Rand similar expressions denote Q, ; the line-

coordinates of a tangent are referred to the polar triangle as one of reference.

   These conditions for a bitangent may be thus written :--

                        apV=(6\y : 26jQ= (6V)= : 2c/-R= -(6V)^

These equations denote three spherical ellipses, whose foci are in the several cases
the points of reference A, B, C, and the corresponding points of reference of the

polar triangle of ABC.

    2. There is a sextic bounding curve, the locus of the satellite-point, when there

is  a  point  of  inflexion                                            this  curve  is  bipartite with an oval.  If the satellite is

within the oval, four critical values of the parameter yield bitangential forms of the

cubic ;  if the satellite is on the oval, one inflexional                                and      two            bitangential cubics

points I, J ; the tangents at these points are these arcs CI, C J : their point of con-

ciu-rence is therefore a double focus. Tliis proof seems applicable only to tlie case

where the focus is the quadi-autal pole of the cyclic arc, the points I, J being in

this case the shadows of the circular points at infinity.

    The argument may be also thus stated. The two lines

or, if real values alone are considered, a double focus, and might be a multiple focus

of a higher order.

Resume of Researches on the Inverse Problems of Moments of Inertia and of
         Moments of Resistance. Bij Professor Giuseppe Juxg (Milan).

   Tn the study of the resistance of materials and the stability of constructions, the
two following problems continually present themselves :

   I. To construct a plane iigure (for example, the cross-section of a cylinder loaded
in a given manner) of which we may suppose given the orientation, the form, the
centre of gravity, and also tlie moment of inertia with respect to a given neutral

axis.

   II. To construct a plane section, given the orientation, the form, the centre of
gravity, and also the moment of resistance * with respect to a given neutral axis.

   * If e is an element of a plane section F, and ;/ be the distance of the barycentre of e

fi'0)u an axis .r measured in the direction \ (\ being a straight line making any angle with

Fthe axis x), then the moment of inertia of with respect to .r in the direction \ is

-- =Si?y- J, the i; extending over the contour of F.

  O FIf, besides, v is the distance (ineasurcc' parallel to X) of the barycentre of from the
tangent Fto parallel to x and furthest removed from O, then the moment of resistance

of P with respect to a barycentric axis .r, in the direction X, is defined to be the ratio --

In fact, if we multiply this ratio by a certain constant v,'c have the ordinary moment of

resistance of tl)e section F.
22 . REPORT--1876.

  These two problems liave recently engaged my attention.

   It is well known that engineers resolve these questions by tentative methods
which sometimes require long calculations, and which besides are incapable of
performance when tlie section is quite irregular; and this is wliy it is necessary to

lixtj-pes (such as a Zores iron, T's, I's, &c.) which, being decomposHble into parts
whose moments of inertia or moments of resistance can be determined analytically,

are calculable.

   By the simple and uniform graphical method which I have proposed, we can

treat in the same manner as the simple sections (triangles, rectangles, &c.) the most
complicated forms (such as a Zores iron or even figures with arbitrarj^ and irregular
contours, whose equations would not. admit of expression) so that, in order to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

render possible the solution of these important problems, we need sacrifice nothing,

either from the economical or the aesthetic point of view.

  I. Let F be the unknown figure that we wish to construct, J its moment of

inertia in a direction X with respect to a given baryceutric axis .f *, F' a figure
homothetical to F, its centre of gravity, and x' a sti-aight line parallel to .r and

passing through 0'.

Let, besides, k be the (unknown) radius of gyration of F, in the direction X with

=respect to x, so that J  k-F                   and  let  J' and A'  be analogous quantities to J and Jc,

relating to F'.

Finallj', let us suppose two orthogonal axes it, to drawn anywhere, on which we
UA WA = Ahave respectively the segments
                                                     =    1, being the point of intersection of

u and 10.

WeSolution : (a)     find directly J' the moment of inertia of F', either by the inte-

grometer or graphical (e. </. by Cidmaun's) method.

(b) On the axis ti take two segments AB, AB' respectivelj' proportional to J and

J', and describe two semicircles on the diameters UB, UB' wliich intercept on the
ACaxis of to the segments AC,
                                                respectively proportional to n/J and \/ J' ; and two
WCsemicircles upon the diameters WC,
                                                          which intercept upon tc the two segments

AD and AD' respectively proportional to 4/j and //J'.

(c) From 0' draw a straight line x' parallel to .(', and take upon x' and x the

OX Xsegments O'X ',
                     respectively equal or proportional to AD' and AD, so that is

with respect to on the same side as X' with respect to 0'. Draw the straight

lines 0' and XX' meeting at the point S.

(d) Finally, transform the figure F' into the homothetical figure F, taking S as

centre of similitude ; that is to say, draw through S a series of lines cutting the

F Mcontour of in the points M', and the coiTesponding points of the required con-

Ftoiu- are formed Ijv constructing the intersections of the radii Si\l' with the straight

lines 051 parallel to O'M'.

  FThis figure is evidently the secticm required, that is to say, a figure which has

given the centre of gravity, the orientation, the form, and also the moment of inertia,

in the direction X, with respect to .r, equal to the given quantity J. In fact the

=Fratio of similitude of the two figures and F' is A^J : !y/J'-

Nofel, When J' has been found, we can calculate directly the number

                                                       /J

OXand then we should take O'X' upon ,r' arbitrarily, and on          we should take

OX=^i . O'X ; we should then continue the procedure as above.
                                                                                   '

Resume of Researches upon the Orapliical Representation of the Moments of

      Resistance of Plane Figures. By Professor Giuseppe Jung (Milan).

Continuing the investigation upon the moments of resistance of a given plane

figure F, I have communicated to the Istituto Lombardo * some results which I

have obtained, and of which I here give a short account.

1. Retaining the same notation as in the last paper, I have given several gra-

phical methods for calculating the radii of resistance r in an arbitrary direction X

R =(and, consequently, the corresponding moments of inertia             F.r) of the figure

F with regard to any barj'ceutric axis x, and I ha^e found several representative

curves, viz. in this sense that these curves have for radii vectores the radii of resis-

tance r. So that, having given an axis x and one of the representative cur\es

(which I show how to construct), we have the corresponding moment of resistance
by multiplying by the area F of the section a certain radius vector of the represen-

tative curve.

   It is remarkable that when the direction X is conjugate to the direction of the
given axis x (i. e. that when the diameter of the central ellipse of F parallel to X is

conjugate to the diameter x), one of the representative curves is the central nucleus

(Centralkeru) t of the figure F, and we have the following theorem :^

* See 'Rendiconti dell' Istituto Lombardo,' ser. 2, t. ix. 1876, No. sv. "Rapprcseu-

   f Perhaps it wiU be usefid to recall here rapidly some notions which are, however, well

known (see, for example, my memoir " Sui momenti d'lucrzia " iu the ' Rendiconti dell'

Istituto Lombardo,' 1875).

X which is tlie centre of the pressures (tt-nsious) oi" tlie centre of the second degree or the

24 REPORT 1876.

The radius of resistance with respect to a harycentric axis, in the direction of the

conjugate diameter, is equal to the smaller of the tico radii vectorcs of the central

nucleus situated on the latter diameter.

  We thus .see that the central nucleus stands in nearly the same relation to

the radii of resistance that the central ellipse does to the radii of gyration of the

figure F. In fact the diiference consists chiefly in this, that each of the radii

yectores of the ellipse situated on the diameter y is equal to the radius of gyration

of F with regard to the conjugate diameter .r; while in general one only (the

smaller) of the two radii ^ectores of the nucleus situated upon y is equal "to the

radius of resistance of F v/ith regard to the conjugate diameter ;r.

  F2. Suppose that is a cross-section of a cylinder upon which are acting forces

situated in a plane passing through its axis, the intersection of this plane with the

Fplane of is the axis of sollieitation of the section F, and the straight line which

passes through its barycentre and is conjugate to the axis of pollicitation is the

neutral barycentric axis. This being premised, I show that

   The moment of resistance with resj}cct to a harycentric axis x, in the conjuyatc

direction y, is equal to the resistance specific * to the cohesion tcith respect to the

flexure relatively to the axis of sollieitation y.

   From which follows a theorem giving the law of variation of the specific resist-
ance of F, when the axis of sollieitation turns round its centre of gravity, viz. :--

The central nucleus of a yiven section is the curve of resistances specific to the cohe-
Asion with respect to the flexure.
                                    radius of the nucleus (tlie smaller of the tivo

Fsituated on the harycentric axis considered) multiplied hy the area yii'cs the specific

resistance with respect to its direction, considered as axis of sollieitation.

  F?>. Taking still the barycentre of as pole and for radii vectores segments pro-

portional to the maxima t specific resistances of the section with respect to the

ilexure and corresponding to each axis of sollieitation, I find the remarkable

theorem :

FThe curve of maxima resistances of /* a transformation hy rcciproccd radii vectores

                                                         radius vector of this inverse

Fcurve, midtiplied hy p, ffives the specific maximum resistance of with resjiect to its

direction, considered as axis of sollieitation.

   4. Two other theorems are connected with a note of M. Ritter, "Ueber cine neue

Festigkeitsformel " (seethe ' Civilingenieur,' 1876, Heft iii., iv.). The more im-

--portant is that which gives a simple solution of the following question : Given

the point of application of the resultant of the forces which act normally on the

Fsection and also the central nucleus, but not the central ellipse, of F, find the

neutral axis corresponding to this point.

  If O is the centre of gravity of F, C the point of application (in the plane of F)

antipolar of the point X. If in any one given direction \, d is tlie distance of the centre

of gravity of F from the straight line x, and k is the radius of gyration of F with respect

to the barycentric asis parallel to .r, the distance, measured parallel to X, of the straight

=line X from its antipole rf+ -j- If a straight line y passes through X, its antipole y lies

Tipon x\ The point X, which is the antipole of the straight line x in this reciprocal system

(antipolar system), is also the pole, in Poucelet's sense, with respect to the central ellipse

Oof F, of the straight lino x' wliieh is symnietrical to x with resjicct to the point (bary-

Fcentre of and centre of its eentrnl ellipse).

FIf a variable straight line envelops tlie contour of  williout cutting it, its antipole

X Fdescribes a closed curve which is the central nucleus (Centralkcrn) of the figure (see

Cnlmann, 'Die graphi^che Statik,' 2nd edition, t. i. .3t''i" Abschnitt, Zurich, 1875).

* It is the moment of resistance of the section for whicli, the axis of sollieitation of tlie

forces being given, the unit of tension (or of pressure) is produced in the most distant

fibre of the neutral axis upon the unit of area of this fibre.
   t That is, the nuixinmm unit tensions (or pressure) on the hypothesis that the moment

of the exterior forces which produces the flexure in the sections of tlie cylinder is =1.

On a new Construction for the Central Nucleus of a Phne Section.
                 By Professor GirsEPPE Jung (Milan).

AI have the honour to communicate to Section a new and very easy method of

representing the radii of gyration of a given plane (figure F), which appears to be

more simple than the known methods of Poinsot, Reye, and Mohr.

From this representation I deduce a new construction for the central nucleus of

F, independent of that of the central ellipse of the figure. Tliis I regard as inter-

esting, because of the importance of the central nucleus in the study of the stability

of constructions, on account of its remarkable properties with regard to the moment

of resistance of the section i&c. (See Oulmann, ' Die graphischo Statik," and the

memoirs of which a ?VAK?He has just been given.)
AA BB1. Let be the centre of gravity of F ;
                                                and  its principle axes of inertia,

E EF AA)(. c. the axes of the central ellipse of ; f and /' (upon
                                                          the two foci of ;

Athe circle which has for diameter the major axis A. Then the radiux of f/yra-

Ftion of {in the normal direction), ivith respect to any harycentric axis x, is the seff-
ffmentM^l' of the perpendicular dratvn to x from one of the points
                                                                    included

between the axis x and the circle 0. In fact the circle is the locus of the feet of

the perpendiculars let fall from the foci//' upon the tangents to the ellipse E.

  Thus the circle represents the radii of gyration of F (in the normal direction)

mwith respect to all the barycentric axes. If from M' we draw the straight line

parallel to x, the segment NN' of any straight line X, included between x and m, is

equal to the radius of gyration with respect to x in the arbitrary direction X ; that

is to say, if we take the angle X,r=90-- co, we have the radius of gyration, in the

              =^i-- WeMM'
direction X,  =NN'.        can dispense with the perpendiculars. It is suffi-

cient to construct, besides the circle 0, the circle r on 0/as diameter : if a; meets

the circle r in the point M, and M/" be drawn cutting the circle in the point M',

the segment MM' will be the required radius of gyration.

  G2. Let be a circle passing through 0, and of arbitrary radius f. If through the

Apoints we draw two parallels to BB, and through the Bpoints t-.vo parallels to

AA, the diagonals of the rectangle so produced meet (i in two point.? a and n', and

A BBthe straight lines A,  meet the same circle in /3 and /3'. i^et \J be the point

of intersection of the chords a a and /3 /3'.

By Umeans of this jyoint xoe construct the harycentric axis y, conjugate to any given
Gbarycentric axis x. It is only necessary to observe that if x cuts in the point X,

XU G OUand                                           is the axis y required. This

Elementary Demonstration of a Fundamental Principle of the Theory of

  Functions. By Paul Mansion, Professor in the University of Ghent.

M. Thomae (' Abriss einer Theorie der complexen Functionen/ 2'° Aiiflage, Halle,

1873, pp. 11-13) first demonstrated rigorously the theorem that "a function ;/=¥x,

whose differential coefficient, both iu the positive and in the negative direction, is

zero for every value of .r, from Xg to X, is constant iu this iuterval." This important

proposition can be demonstrated in an elementary manner by the following method,

which seems capable also of other applications.

  =I. If the differential coefficient of a function ij Fx in the positive direction is

the same as in the negative direction, this differential coefficient is equal, for a

               On Convergerds. By Thomas Mttie, M.A., F.B.S.E.

    In Lagrange's additions to Euler's Algebra (2nd Eng. ed. vol. ii. p. 279), he sets
himself the problem,--^//-ac^io?/ expressed by a great number offigures being given,
to find all the fractions, in less terms, which ajjproach so near the truth that it is im-
possible to approach nearer without employing greater ones ; and for solution he gives
in effect the following rule -.--Transform the given fraction into a continued fraction
with unit numerators and positive integral paiiial denominators, and the so-called con-
fergents of this continued fraction ivill be the fractions required. In this he is in error,
the' fi-actions found being some of the fractions required, but not all. Thus, taking

111IT as the given fractional form, he transforms it into
                                   o3+ 7+ 15+ 1+.

he says :--" So that we may be assured that the fraction \ approaches nearer the

truth than any other fraction whose denominator is less than 7 ; also the fraction

y approaches nearer the tnith than any other fraction whose denominator is less

than 106 ; and so of others."

   The statement here made in reference to j is easily seen to be incorrect by com-

%paring the difference of \ fi-om tt with that of ",         or ^, the former being, of

course, -14159 .  . . , and the three latter -10840 . . . ,  -05840 . . . ,  '02507                                    .  .;  and
                                                                                                                    .

the incon-ectness extends to what is said of the other convergents. The ti-ue solu-

tion lies in the fact that not only is 3 \-\ one of the required fractions, but so also
                                                                                                    a*

and so on. When an even partial denominator occurs, we take as the partial deno-

minator to begin with, either its half or the first integer greater than its half, accor-

ding as the partial denominator following is greater or less than that preceding, or,

these being equal, according as the next following is less or greater than the next

preceding, and so on.

Another improvement, though verbal, is important, viz. in regard to the term

convergent, the present definition of which seems arbitrary and unreasonable. With

Agreat convenience it may be defined as follows :  convergent of a fractional

number is a fraction ivhich is a closer approximation to the given mimher than any

other fraction icith a smaller denominator; so that Lagrange's problem is simply to

find all the convergetits of ang fraction.

Then .r is the limit to which co, 2"^(B[, '2'-ai,^, 2 -'0)3 .... converge. If c is mode-

rately small, the convergence is rapid. But if e^ is very near to 1, it may be ex-

pedient to reverse the direction of the new amplitudes and moduli, viz. to calculate

c backwards c', 0", c'", so as to make c'", c", c', c, c,, Co, . . . . a series continued by a

single law; and similarly from to calculate backwards co', w" , a'"  Then a,

tically suffices, presuming that we have at hand tables of F(c, ^tt) and F(h, Itt).

But Legendre, who discovered a new scale after completing his principal calcu-

lations, regarded his new scale as having much advantage in finding F(c, co) at

once rapidtv and accurately. In it .r is the limit of co, 3"iuj, 3'^a>.,, S-^a>.^ . . . ., and

the convergence, generally excellent in Ivagrauge's scale, is far more rapid in

The relation of c, Cj, <?,,, c^ .... in Lagrange's scale corresponds with p, 2p, 2^p, 2'p,

and in Legendre's scale Avith p, 3p, o'-'p, -Tp . . . . , which involve no trouble iu

calculating. No doubt we need tables (of single entry and easily compiled) to yield

c, b when p is given, and p when c is given. Presuming these, we may treat .f and

r(c, to) as functions of p and <a ; after which the difficulties of the constant multi-
Aplier vanish, and Legendre's scale becomes practical to us.

General Theorems relating to Closed Curves. By Professor P. G. Tait.

The closed ciu-ves contemplated are supposed to have nothing higher than double

points. By infinitesimal changes of position of the branches intersecting in it, a

triple point is decomposed into three double points, a quadruple point into six, and

---- Agenerally an a-ple point into --^
                      I'^T-- 1 ^  double points. (1)          closed curve cuts any

infinite unknotted Hue in an even number of points [infinite here implies merely
that botli ends are outside the closed curve]. (2) The same is true if the line be
knotted. (3) If any two closed curves cut one another, there is an even number
of points of intersection. (4) In going continuously along a closed curve from a,
point of intersection to the same point again an even number of intersections is
passed. (5) Hence in going round such a closed curve we may go alternately

above and below the branches as we meet them. (G) By (3) the same proposition

is true of a complex arrangement of any number of separate closed curves super-

posed iu any manner. (7) In passing from the interior of any one cell to that of

--any other^in any system of superposed closed curves the number of crossings in

always even or always odd, whatever path we take. (8) Hence the cells may be
colom-ed black and white iu such a way that from white to white there is always
an even number of crossings, and from white to black an odd number. Such closed

curves therefore divide the plane as nodal lines do a vibrating plite.

   The above are the enunciations of the propositions proved iu the paper, which,

with the necessary figures &c., will be found printed in exfenso in the ' Mes.^enger

   The author referred to a series of papers of his on unitation recently published
in the 'Philosophical Magazine/ and to some remarks published in the I3rit. Assoc.
volume for 1870. If x divided by 8 leave remainder y, then the author calls y the
unitate of x to the base S, and writes V^x^y. The results of " unitation " may be
conveniently applied to the verification of many numerical operations. The method

of unitation is practically equivalent to the theory of congruencies, viz. the equa-

tion Uja;= y would be written x^y (mod S) ; and many of the results are iden-

tical with those given by Gauss.

On the Influence of the Residual Oas on the Movement of the Radiometer.

                          By William Crookes, F.R.S.

The author's recent experiments show that the movement of this instrument is

not due to a direct repulsion exerted by light on the vanes, but to a mutual action

called out between these vanes and the" very attenuated gas remaining in the instru-

ment. It is well known that, with a moderately good vacuum, the motion becomes

more rapid as the  exhaustion  proceeds                                            but he has recently succeeded in producing
                                                                                ;

such a complete exhaustion that he not only reaches the p'oint of maximum effect,

but goes so far beyond it that the effect nearly ceases. The vacuum is measured by

means of a special apparatus, in which a moving plate, instead of continuously rota-

ting in one direction, as in the ordinary radiometer, is suspended by a glass fibre,

which it twists in opposite directions alternately. The movement is started by

rotating the whole apparatus through a small angle, and the observation consists in

noting the successive amplitudes of vibration when the instrument is left to itself,

a mirror and spot of light being employed for this purpose. The amplitudes form

a decreasing series, with a regular logarithmic decrement. The logarithmic decre-

ment is nearly constant up to the point at which the vacuum is apparently equal to

a Torricellian vacuum, the mercury in the gauge standing at the same height as a

barometric colunm beside it ; but as the exhaustion proceeds beyond this point, the

logarithmic decrement becomes smaller--in other words, the amplitude diminishes

less rapidly. By plotting the observations and supposing the ciu've continued, it is

indicated that, if a perfect vacuum were attained, and the glass fibre had no visco-

sity, the logai'ithmic decrement would be zero, we should have perpetual motion

with constant amplitude, whilst, at the same time, the radiometer would cease to

act. Other gases as well as air have been tried. Aqueous vapour is very unfavour-

able to the action of the radiometer ; hydrogen, on the contrary, gives the best

result of all. Several experiments have been already described, which seem to

point to the true explanation of the action of the radiometer ; but the author thinks

!Mr. Stoney's explanation the clearest. According to this, the repulsion is due to

the intei'ual movements of the molecules of the residual gas. When tlie mean

length of path between successive collisions of the molecules is small compared

with the dimensions of the vessel, the molecules, rebounding from the heated sur-

face, and therefore moving with an extra velocity, help to keep back the mora

slowlj- moving molecules wliich are advancing towards the heated surface ; it thus
happens that though the individual kicks against the heated sm-face are increased
in strength in consequence of the heating, yet the number of molecules struck is
diminished in the same proportion, so that there is equilibrium on the two sides of
the disk, even though the temperatures of the faces ai-e imequal. But when the
exhaustion is carried to so high a point that the molecules are sufficiently few, and
the mean length of path between their successive collisions is comparable with the
dimensions of the A-essel, the swiftly moving, rebounding molecules spend their
force, in part or in whole, on the sides of the vessel, and the onward crowding,
more slowly moving molecules are not kept back as before, so that the number
which strike the warmer face approaches to, and in the limit equals, the number
which strike the back, cooler face, and as the individual impacts are stronger on
the warmer than on the cooler face, pressure is produced, causing the warmer face

to retreat*.

  Experimental Illustration of the Origin of Windings of Rivers in Alluvial

   The author referred to a communication which he had made to the Royal Society
in the month of May last J, in which he had given a new theory of the flow of
water round bends in rivers and round bends in pipes, and had explained the
reason why, in alluvial plains, the bends of rivers go on increasing hy the wearing
away of the outer bank, and the deposition of mud, sand, and gravel on the inner

bank. The theoretical view which he had then ofl'ered, he now, for the first time,
had verified by practical experiment ; and this experiment he showed in the
meeting. The chief point of the new view now experimentally proved was that
the water in turning: the bend exerts centrifugal force, but that a thin lamina of the
water at bottom, or in close proximity to the bed of the river, is retarded by friction
with the river-bed, and so exerts less centrifugal force than do like portions of tlie
great body of the water flowing over it in less close proximity to the river-bed.
(Jousequeutly the bottom layer flows inward obliquely across the channel towards
the inner bank, and rises up in its retarded condition between the inner bank and
the rapidly flowing water, and protects the inner bank from the scour, and biings
with it sand and other detritus from the bottom, which it deposits along the inner
bank. The apparatus showed a small river, about 8 inches wide and an inch or two
deep, flowing round a bend, and exhibiting very completely the phenomena which
had been anticipated.

On Metric Units of Force, Energy, and Power, larger tlian those on the Centi-
   metre- Gram-Second System. Bif Jajies Thomson, LL.D., D.Sc, F.R.S.E.,

   Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics in the University of Glasgow.

The author premises that under the excellent method of Gauss for establishing

units of force, a unit of force is taken as being the force which, if applied to a unit

of mass for a unit of time, v.ill impart to it a unit of \elocity. In the system

already adoptL'd by the British Association Committee on Dynamical and Electrical

Cnits (Erit. Assoc. Eeport, part i. 187.3, page 222), the Centimetre, the Gram *,

and the Second were taken as the units of length, of mass, and of time and the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

unit of force thence derived under the method of Gauss was called the Dyne.

That force is very small, quite too small for convenient use in all ordinarj'

mechanical or engineering investigations. It is about equal to the gravity of a

milligram mass, and that force is so small that it cannot be felt when applied to

the hand. That system, designated as the Centimetre-Gram-Second System,

recommended by the Committee of the British Association, and described fidly,

with many applications, in a book since published by Dr. Everett, who was
Secretarj' to the Committee, is well suited for many dynamical and electrical

pm-poses                                            and it ought certainly to be maintained                                                                             for  use  in  all cases in which it
                                                 ;

is convenient. But tiie object of the present paper is to recommend the emploj--

nient also of two other systems which are in perfect harmony with it, and to
propose names for the units of force under these two systems.

In one of these systems, the Decimetre, the Kilogram, and the Second are the

imits  adopted                                      for  length, mass, and time                                                                                         and thus the sj'stem comes to be called
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

the Decimetre-Kilogram-Second System.

   In the other, the Metre, the Tonne t, and the Second are adopted as the units of
length, mass, and time; and thus the system comes to be called the Metre-Tonne-
Second System.

    It is to be particularly observed that all the three systems here referred to are
framed so as to attain the condition, verv- important for convenience, that the
unit of mass adopted is the mass of a unit volume of water, and that, therefore,

for every substance tlie specific gravity and the density, or mass per unit of volume,
are made to be numerically the same.

   In the Decimetre-Kilogram-Second System, the unit of force derived by the
method of Gauss is 10,000 Dynes, or is about equal to the gravity of 10 Grams.

It is impossible, or almost so, to work practically with any such system without
having a name for the unit of force. The unit of force in this system is such that
a human hair is well suited for bearing it as a pull, with ample allowance of extra

Ireland.

is very nearly the same as the British Ton.

strength for safety agaiii.st breakage ; and tlie author proposes to call it the Crinitl,

from'the Latin crinis and ciimtlid.                                             _
In the Metre-Tonne-Second System the unit of force, likewise derived hy the

(Gaussian method, is 10,000 Crinals, or 100,000,000 Dynes, or is about equal to the

gravity of 2 cwt., or of ^o o^' « ton. This force would be properly borne as a pull
by a iuoderatcly-sized rope ; and the author proposes to call it the Fiiiial, from

the Latiji funis and funalis.

   Then we have One Horse-Power, of 33,000 foot-pounds per mmute, about equal

to 75,000 Decimetre-Crinals per second ; and the Horse-Power is also about equal

to 75 of a Metre-Funal per second.

  =Also 1 Metre-Funal 100,000 Decimetre-Crinals,
                        = 10,000,000,000 Centimetre-Dynes, or Erg-s,

                      = 10^" Ergs.
=Also 1 Horse-Power is about 7,500,000,000 Centimetre-Dynes per second,

or as the same may be written                             75 X 10^ Centimetre-Dynes per second.

The number 7,500,000,000, for expressing a Horse-Power under the Centimetre-

Gram-Second System, is an exceedingly unmanageable one ; and it gives a very

decisive indication that the Centimetre and Gram are too suiall to be suitable as

fundamental units of length and of mass for ordinary engineering purposes ; and

that there is great need fur the establishment of systems having larger units, such
as those which have beeu recommended in the present paper, and for which a con-

venient nomenclature has been offered.

   It is to be observed that the provision made by the British Association Com-

mittee, in the Eeport already referred to, of a uinhiplo of the Dyne, such as the

Megadyne, or million of Dynes, as a larger unit of force, does not accomplish all

that is'to be desired, because various important formulas, or convenient methods

of statement, will not hold good when any of the units are so derived. Thus, for
instance, if the Megadyne be the unit of force, while the Gram and Second are the

units of mass and time, the ordinary formulas for giving the so-called " centrifugal

force " of a revolving mass,

                                                          --F= and r =nno-r,
                                                                   r

will  not  hold  good                            and, as  another  instance, we may notice that the proposition
                                              ;

that, in respect to a jet of water, the reaction force on the vessel is equal numeri-

cally to the momentum generated per second, will not hold good ; and numberless

other instances might readily be cited, but those given may suffice.

On tlie Preeessional Motion of a Ln^u'td. By Sir W. Thomson, D.G.L., F.B.tS.

   The formulas expressing this motion were briefly explained, but the analytical
treatment of them was reserved for a paper " On the Nutation of a Solid Shell
containing Liquid." The chief object of the present communication was to illus-
trate experimentally a conclusion from this theory which has been announced by

the author in his opening address to the Section, to the effect that, if the period of

the precession of an oblate spheroidal rigid shell full of liquid is a much greater

multiple of the rotational period of the liquid than any diameter of the spheroid is
of the diiference between the greatest and least diameters, the preeessional effect
of a given couple acting on the shell is approximately the same as if the whole
were a solid rotating with the same rotational velocity. The experiment consisted
in showing a liquid gyrostat, in which an oblate spheroid of thin sheet-copper
filled with water was substituted for the solid fly-wheel of the ordinary gyrostat.
In the instrument actually exhibited the equatorial diameter of the liquid shell
exceeded the polar axis by about one tenth of either.

    Supposing the rotational speed to be thirty turus per second, the effect of any
motive which, if acting on a rotating solid of the same mass and dimensions, would
produce a precession having its period a considerable multiple of ^ of a second,
must, according to theorj', produce very approximately the same precession in the
thin shell filled with liquid as in the'rotating solid. Accordingly the main pre-
                                                                                                  ----

cessioual phenomena of the liquid gyrostat were not noticeably different from those
of ordinary solid gyrostats, which were shown in action for the sake of comparison.
It is probable that careful observation without measurement might show very sen-
sible differences between the performances of the liquid and the solid gyrostat in
the way of nutational tremors produced by striliing the case of the Instrument
with the fist.

   No attempt at measurement either of speeds or forces was included in the com-

munication, and the author merely showed the liquid gyrostat as a rough general
illustration, which he hoped might be regarded as an interesting illustration of that
very interesting result of mathematical hydroldnetics, the quasi-rigidity produced
in a frictionless liquid by rotation.

  --P.S. Since the communication of this paper to the Association, and the de-

livery of my opening address v/hich preceded it on the same day, I have received

from Prof. Henry No. 240 of the ' Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,' of

                                                                                                                                                                          le

portion of my previously pubfished statements which I had taken the occasion of
my address to correct, expressed in the following terms :

   "I do not concur with Sir William Thomson in the opinions quoted in note,
p. 38, from Thomson and Tait, and expressed in his letter to Mr. G. Poulett

Scrope (' Nature,' Feb. 1, 1872) ; so far as regards fluidity or imperfect rigidity,

within an infinitely rigid envelope, I do not think the rate of precession would be

affected."

Elsewhere in the same paper Gen. Barnard speaks of " the practical rigidity con-

ferred by rotation." Thus he has anticipated my correction of the statements con-

mytained in  paper on the rigidity of the earth, so far as regards the effect of inte-

rior fluidity on the precessional motion of a perfectly rigid ellipsoidal shell filled

with fluid.

myI regret to see that the other error of that paper v.'hich I corrected in                                              opening

address had not been corrected by Gen. Barnard, and that the plausible i-easoning

which had led me to it had also seemed to him convincing. For myself I can only

say that I took the very earliest opportunity to correct the errors after I found them

to be errors, and that I deeply regret any mischief they mav have done in the mean

time.

 --Solid and Liquid Gijrodats. The solid gvrostat has been regularly shown for

many years in the natural philosophy class of the University of Glasgow as a me-

chanical illustration of the dynamics of rotating solids, and it has also been exhibi-
ted in London and Edinburgh at conversaziones of the Royal Societies and of the

Society of Telegraph Engineers, but no account of it has yet been published. The

following is a brief description of it.

   The solid gjTOstat consists essentially of a massive flv-wheel, possessing great
moment of inertia, pivoted on the two ends of its axis in bearings attached to an
outer case which completely encloses it. Fig. 1 represents a section by a plane

through the axis of the fly-wheel, and fig. 2 a section by a plane at right angles to

the axis and cutting through the case just above the fiy-wheel. The containino--

case is fitted with a thin projecting edge in the plane of the flj'-wheel, which "is
called the bearing-edge. Its boundary forms a regular curvilinear polygon of six-

teen sides with its centre at the centre of the fly-wheel. Each side of 'the polygon

is a small arc of a circle of railius greater than the distance of the corners from the
centre. The friction of the fly-wheel would, if the bearing-edge were circular,

cause the case to roll along it  like a hoop                                                      and it is to  prevent  this effect that the
                                                                                               ;

curved polygonal form described above and represented in the drawing is given to

the bearing-edge.

   To spin the solid gyrostat a piece of stout cord about forty feet long and a place
where a clear run of about GO feet can be obtained are convenient. The gyrostat
having been placed with the axis of its fly-wheel vertical, the cord is passed in
through an aperture in the case two and a half times round the bobbm-shaped

part of the shaft and out again at an aperture on the opposite side. Having taken

care that the slack cord is placed clear of all obstacles, and that it is free from kiiilcs,
the operator holds the gyrostat steady, so that its case is prevented from turning,
while an assistant pulls the cord through by running, at a gradually increasing pace,
away fi-om the instrument, while holding the end of the cord iu his hand. Suili-
cient tension is applied to the entering cord to prevent it from slipping round on

the shaft. In this way a very great angular velocity is communicated to the fly-

wheel, sufficient, indeed, to keep it spinning for upwards of twenty minutes.
   If, when the gyrostat has been spun, it be set on its bearing-edge with the centre

of gravity exactly over the bearing point, on a smooth horizontal plane such as a
piece of plate-glass lying on a table, it will continue apparently stationary and iu
stable equilibrium. If while it is in this position a couple round a horizontal axis

in the plane of the flj'-wheel be applied to the wheel, no deflection of this plana
from the vertical is produced, but it rotates slowly round a vertical axis. If a
heavy blow with the flst be given to the side of the case, it is met by what seems
to the senses the resistance of a very stiff" elastic body, and, for a few seconds after

the blow, the gyrostat is in a state of violent tremor, which, however, subsides

rapidly. As the rotational velocity gradually diminishes, the rapidity of the tremors
produced by the blow also diminishes. It is very curious to notice the tottering
condition, and slow, seemingly palsied tremulousness of the gyrostat when the fly-
wheel has nearly ceased to spin.

   In the liquid gyrostat the fly-wheel is replaced by an oblate spheroid, made of
thin sheet-copper and lilled with water. The ellipticity of this shell in the in-

--strument exhibited is yV that is to say, the equatorial diameter exceeds the polar

by that fraction of either. It is pivoted on the two ends of its polar axis in bear-
ings fixed in a circular ring of brass surrounding the spheroid. This circle of brass
is rigidly connected with the curved polygonal bearing-edge which lies iu the
equatorial plane of the instrument, thus forming a framework for the support of
the spheroidal shell. In fig. 3 a section is represented through the polar axis to
show the ellipticit}', and fig. 4 gives a view of the gyrostat as seen from a point in
the prolongation of the axis. To prevent accident to the shell, when the gyrostat
falls down at the end of its spin, cage-bars are fitted round it in such a way that no

plane can touch the shell.

   The method of spinning the liquid gyrostat is similar to that desci-ibed for the
solid g^TOstat, differing only in the use of a very much longer cord and of a large
wheel for the purpose of pidling it. The cord is first wound on a bobbin free to
rotate round a fixed pin. The end of it is then passed two and a half times round
a little pulley, and thence to a point in the circumference of a large wheel to

which it is fixed. An assistant then turns the wheel with gradually increasing

velocity, while the frame of the gyrostat is firmly held, and the requisite tension
applied to the entering cord to prevent it from slipping round the pulley.

                          Oyi the Testings of Large Objectives.

By Howard Grtjbb, Master of Engineering, Trinity College, Dublin.

   In the testing of large objectives, wlien the corrections have been made to be very

nearly perfect, a difficulty is sometimes felt in determining what, if any, corrections

remain desirable, and also of determining in a simple way the anioimt of the desired

alteration.

   For the chromatic aberration one plan often pursued by the optician is to slightly
overcorrect the objective in the iirst instance, and then to separate the crown and

flint (thus reducing the correction) until the best result is attained, when the
amount of separation required becomes by a simple calculation a measure of the

necessary alteration in the curves.
   This is an extremely useful practical an-angement ; but unfortunately it is appli-

cable to onlv one of the four possible errors, besides being troublesome and some-

what dangerous in the case of large objectives.

  +The desirability of some simple plan of introducing, pro tempore, a small or

-- effect of chromatic or spherical aberration, and of being able to accin-ately esti-

mate the quantity of such, has been very apparent to me on seA'eral occasions ; for

I have frequently found the best judges of such matters differ in their estimate of
final correction, "and unable to agree thereon; and I have also often found a diffi-
culty in satisfying myself that the best balance of corrections had been attained

+ --whereas if it "were possible to introduce a small amount, pro tempore, of or

correction, T could at once have perceived when I had overshot the mark. In
fact the perfection of any connection in an objective means the best balance bc-

ticeen two opposinff aberrations, and (just as in all cases of ascertaining balances)
it is difficult to determine the neutral point unless there be the power of trying on

both sides.

   To effect this, in preparing for the trial of the great objective for the new Obser-
vatory at Vienna (of 27 inches aperture), I am constructing four lenses or combina-
tion of lenses capable of being mounted between the objective and ocular, and with

a considerable range of motion in the axis of the telescope :

A. While it effects no other correction introduces a small amount of -(-

chromatic aberration.
--B. Similarly introduces a small amount of chromatic aberration.

+0. ,, ',,spherical aberration.
--J). ,,,,spherical aberration.

The .'imount of any aberration introduced can be regulated by the position of the

   Now, knowing the construction of these combinations and their position in the
pencil of rays from objective to ocular, the corresponding correction in the objective

IS an easily calculable quantity. Quite apart from the use to the optician I believe

the comfort of these appliances will be much appreciated by those appointed as

judges, particularly where, as in the case of the Vienna telescope, the testing of the
objective forms part of the work of a Committee composed of a considerable number

of Members.
   I have already experimented in this direction sufficiently to convince myself of

the great value of this system so far as the correction for chromatic aberration is

mconcerned; but I have not yet oxpeiimented on the spherical aberration, nor am

I so sanguine of its success.

   There sceras another direction in which a possible advantage might be gained
by use of these correcting combinations, viz. in the case of minute stars wliose
light is made up for a great part of rays from either end of the spectrum, more
particularly the blue end. It seems highly probable that better definition of these
stars could be obtained if a slight temporary adj ustment could be made in the
chromatic correction suitable for that particular part of the spectrum from which
the predominant light of the stai's proceeds.

   Of course it is to be understood that the corrections here spoken of and proposed

--to be dealt with by their correcting lenses are ojily the very final ones in fact, when

the objective arrives at that degree of perfection in which it is almost impossible
to say whether any improvement can be effected or not.

On a Method of Phofograpiling the Defects in Optical Glass arising from want

  of Jlomngenetfy. By Hovvakd Grubb, Master of Engineering, Trinity

    College, Duhlin.

The best practical method used for detecting in disks of optical glass defects

arising from want of homogeneity is probably well known to many amateurs as well

as to professional opticians.

The disk of glass to be examined should be either itself polished to a convex form,

or, if that be not convenient, it should be placed in juxtaposition with a piece of

glass which is known to be perfect and of such form as will i-ender the combination

Aof the two of convex power.   small light (say gas- or candle-flame, or any suf-

ficiently brilliant light with a small diaphragm in front, see fig. 1) is placed at some

little distance, and the eye is placed in the conjugate focus formed by the lens of
this light. The disk of glass should then appear brilliantlv illuminated ; but if

the pupil of the eye is drawn slightly to one side, so that the pencil of light falls
upon only one half of the pupil, immediately and most distinctly almost any want
ot homogeueilv is easilv seen.

   1 say " almost any want of homogeneity," because, with one exception, I believe
any kind can be detected ; but I have met, very rarely, instances of one peculiar
class of this defect which it is not possible to detect till the disk is actually worked
into an objective : this happens when a slight gradual change of density occurs be-
tween two portions of the disk with no abrupt line of separation between.

  Now this process, though a very simple one to a practised eye, is by no means so

to an uneducated one ; and I have often desired a method by which I could gi-aphi-

cally represent those faults so that I might be able to communicate to others my

ideas as to their exact forms and appearance, position in the disk, and so forth, and
also to form a record of them. This, by a very simple contrivance, I have succeeded

in doing, and I am now able to photograph these defects in optical glass with per-

fect certainty.

  A glance at the diagram will sufRce to show the principle by which this is

effected.

       On the Decrease of Ti'mpendure with Height on the Earth's Surface.

                               By Trofossor Hunnessy, F.ILS.

   If the air were perfectly still, the temperature at any point in the atmosphere
would depend on its density, the heat absorbed from the solar rays, the heat ob-
tained by convection from the earth, and the losses of lieat by radiation.

   Of these the first has been almost exclusively considered. This is especially so
ill all investigations for the ascertainment of lieights by the barometer. The exclu-
sion of the other causes of variation of temperature with heig-lit may be admissible
in considering the condition of a vertical column of air resting on a horizontal plane
but the problem assumes a very different character when tlie decrease of tempera-
ture witli height along a very gradually sloping surface is considered. Such a
surface is constantly communicating its temperature by convection currents to the
overlying air, and the temperature of this air will depend on the extent, form, and
physical properties of the underlying surface. If we suppose a flat plain on the
level of the sea, an observer in a balloon at a height of 1000 feet would find the
temperature almost unaffected by convection and dependent upon density. If, now,
a steep mountain is superimposed on the plain and reaching to the observer, the
conditions become altered. If a mountain of a gradual slope be superimposed, the
alteration will be still gi-eater ; and if the entire plain were elevated up to 1000
feet so as to form an extensive tableland, the change of conditions would be very

remarkable.

    It follows that the law of vaiiation of temperature with height above the level
of the sea cannot be considered as uniform. The decrease is most rapid in going
up through a vertical column of air, as in balloon ascents. It is slower along

mountain sides, and slowest along gradually sloping plains or tablelands.

   From an examination of tlie records of many observations, it appears that the

decrease of temperature in balloon ascents is nearly one degree Fahrenheit for 300

feet, while for tablelands it is so slow as from 500 to 800 feet for one degree.
    The author referred to a number of observations made in different countries con-

firming the general conclusions to which he has been led.

            On the Distribution of Temperature over the British Islands.

                            By Professor Hennesst, F.B.S.

   The author referred to his former researches on the distribution of temper.^ture
over islands surroimded by heat-bearing cun-euts and his demonstration that many

of the isothermal lines in such islands must necessarily be closed curves*. He had

originally illustrated his conclusions by the results of observations taken in the
British Islands, and the isothermal lines laid down from such observations were
found to be in perfect harmony with the law he had proved. In order to render

this manifest he tabulated together the temperature of each, stating its latitude,
longitude, height above the sea, and horizontal distance from the nearest sea coast.
The actual temperature of any place is affected by all of these elements. In laying

down the isothermal lines the actual temperatures unaltered by any so-called cor-
rection for height were always employed. The stations were arranged according to
temperature, and thus isothermal groups were immediately discovered. If the more
recent collection of temperature results for the British Isles compiled by Mr. Buchan
in the Journal of the Scottish Meteorological Society be treated in this way and the

arbitrary and erroneous addition of 1° per every 300 feet in height be omitted, his

results will conform to the law enimciated by the author.

On Rotation of the Plane of Polarization by Reflection from a Magnetic Pole.

   By John Kerr, LL.D., Mathematiccd Lecturer of the Free Church Training

    College, Glasgow*.

In these experiments a beam of light is polarized by a first Nicol, reflected regu-

larly from the end of an electromagnetic core of soft iron, and analyzed by a second

Nicol. The magnetic force is concentrated intensely upon the miiTor by means of

a massive wedge of soft iron, which is separated from it by a narrow chink. The

light is incident upon the polar mirror at an angle of C0° to 80°; the plane of

polarization coincides with the plane of incidence ; and the two Nicols are exactly

--crossed, so that the reflected light is extinguished by the second Nicol.

  First Experiment. When the iron mirror is intensely magnetized as N. pole or

S. pole, the light is distinctly restored from pure extinction, to disappear at once

--when tlie circuit of the magnetizing current is broken.
   Second Experiment. The first Nicol is turned from its initial position through

an extremely small angle-- (1) to the right, (2) to the left (from the point of inci-
dence on the iron mirror as point of view), so that the reflected light is restored

very faintly through the second Nicol. When the mirror becomes an intense S.

pole, the eftects of rotations (1) and (2) are strengtheued and weakened respectively;
on the contrary, when the miiTor becomes an intense N. pole, the effects of rota-

tions (1) and (2) are weakened and strengthened respectively.

In the two remaining experiments the optical ellects of "the preceding rotations

(1) and (2) and of magnetizations S. and N. of the mirror are compensated sepa-
rately. The compensator is a slip of plate-glass, held in a standard position between

the mirror and the second Nicol and strained by the hands. The angle of incidence

is about 75^.

  --Third Experiment. The first Nicol is turned from its initial position through an

extremely small angle-- (1) to the right, (2} to the left, so that the light is faintly
restored from extinction by the second Nicol. The eftects of displacement (1)
and (2) are compensated, dowu to pure extinction, by tension and compression

respectively.

                       repetition of the first, with addition of the compensator.

The eftects of magnetizations S. and N. of the mirror are compensated, down to

pure extinction, by tension and compression respectively.

The case of perpendicular incidence was tried carefully, but gave no good effect,

the arrangements being comparatively imperfect. From" the facts observed, it fol-

lows evidently that when a beam of "plane polarized light is reflected from a mag-

--netic pole, the plane of polarization is turned in the process of reflexion to the

left by a south-seeking pole, to the right by a north-seeking pole ; so that in this

case of refloction from iron, as in most cases of transmission through salts of iron,
the plane of polarization is turned in a direction contrary to that of the magne-

tizing current.

A Description of Sjjottiswoode's Poclcet Polarizing Apparatus. By AY. Ladd.

On a Phenomenon of Metallic IttJIection. By Professor G. G. Stokes, F.E.S.

  The phenomenon which I am about to describe was observed by me many years
ago, and may not improbably have been seen by others ; but as I have never seen

any notice of it, and it is in some respects very remarkable, I think that a descrip-

tion of it will not be unacceptable.

  When Newton's rings are formed between a lens and a plate of metal, and are
viewed by light polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, we know

that, as the angle of incidence is increased, the rings, which are at first dark-

centred, disappear on passing the polarizing angle of the glass, and then reappear

white-centred, in which state they remain up to a gi-azing incidence, when they can
no longer be followed. At a high incidence the first dark ring is much the most

conspicuous of the series.

   To follow the rings beyond the limit of total internal reflection we must employ

a prism. When the rings formed between glass and glass are viewed in this way,

we know that as the angle of incidence is increased the rings one by one open out,

uniting with bands of the same respective orders which are seen beneath the limit

of total internal reflection ; the limit or boundary between total and partial reflection

passes down beneath the point of contact, and the central dark spot is left isolated

m a bright field.

  Now when the rings are formed between a prism with a slightly convex base

and a plate of silver, and the angle of incidence is increased so as to pass the cri-

tical angle, if common light be used, in lieu of a simple spot we have a ring, which

becomes more conspicuous at a certain angle of incidence well beyond the critical
angle, after which it rapidly contracts and passes into a spot.

   As thus viewed the ring is, however, somewhat confused. To study the pheno-
menon in its purity we must employ polarized light, or, which is more convenient,
analyze the reflected light by means of a Nicol's prism.

   When viewed by light polarized in the plane of incidence, the rings show nothing

remarkable. They are naturally weaker than with glass, as the interfering streams
are so unequal in intensity. They are black-centred throughout, and, as with glass,
they open out one after another on approaching the limit of total reflection and

disappear, leaving the central spot isolated in the bright field beyond the limit.

The spot appears to be notably smaller than with glass under like conditions.
   With light polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, the rings pass

from dark-centred to bright-centred on passing the polarizing angle of the glass,
and open out as they approach the limit of total reflection. The last dark ring to
disappear is not, however, the first, but the second. The first, corresponding in
order to the first bright ring within the polarizing angle of the glass, remains iso-
lated in the bright field, enclosing a relatively, though not absolutely, bright spot.
At the centre of the spot the glass and metal are in optical contact, and the reflection
takes place accordingly and is not total. The dark ring, too, is not absolutely

black. As the angle of internal incidence increases by a few degrees, the dark ring

undergoes a rapid and remarkable change. Its intensity increases till (in the case

of silver) the ring becomes sensibly black ; then it rapidly contracts, squeezing out,

as it were, the bright central spot, and forming itself a dark spot, larger than with

Whenglass, isolated in the bright field.   at its best it is distinctly seen to bo

fringed with colour, blue outside, red inside (especially the former), showing that

the scale of the ring depends on the wave-length, being greater for the less refran-

gible colours. This rapid alteration taking place well beyond the critical angle is

verj' remarkable. Clearly there is a rapid change in the reflective properties of the

metal, wliich takes place, so to speak, in passing through a certain angle determined

bv a sine greater than unity.              4

42 REPORT--1876.

I have described the phenomenon with silver, which shows it hest ; but specidum-

metal, gold, and copper show it very well, while with steel it is far less conspicuous.

When the coloured metals gold and copper are examined by the light of a pure

spectrum, the ring is seen to be better formed in the less than in the more refi'an-

gible colours, being more intense when at its best ; while with silver and speculum-

metal there is little difference, except as to size, in the different colours. Hfematite

and iron pyrites, which approach the metals in opacity and in the change of phase

which they produce by reflection of light polarized parallel relatively to light polarized

perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, do not exactly form a ring isolated in a

bright field ; but the spot seen with light polarized perpendicidarly to the plane of

incidence is abnormally broad just about the limit of total reflection, and rapidly

contracts on increasing the angle of incidence.

It seemed to me that a sequence may be traced from the rapidly contracting

rings of diamond seen in passing the polarizing angle of that substance, through the

abnormally broad and rapidly contracting spot seen with iron pyrites just about

the limit of total reflection, and the somewhat inconspicuous ring of steel seen a

little beyond the limit, to the intense rapidly contracting ring of silver seen consi-
Kderably beyond the limit.
                                                                                                                     so, the full theory of the ring will not be contained

in the usually accepted formulae for metallic reflection, modified, as in the case of

transparent substances, in accordance with the circumstance that the incidence on

the first surface of the plate of air is beyond that of total reflection.

MacOullagh was the first to obtain the formulae for metallic reflection, showing

that they were to be deduced from Fresnel's formulae by making the refractive

index a mixed imaginary, though they are usually attributed to Oauchy, who

has given formulae differing from those of MacHullagh merely in algebraic detail.

As regards theory, Cauchy made an important advance on what MacCullagh had

done in connecting the peculiar optical properties of metals with their intense ab-

sorbing power*. Now Fresnel's formulae do not include the phenomena discovered

by Sir George Airy, which are seen in passing the polarizing angle of diamond,

and which have been more recently extended by M. Jamin to the generality of

transparent substances                                                                                       and if  these pass by regular sequence to  those  I  have de-
                                                                                                          ;

scribed as seen with metals beyond the limit of total internal reflection, it follows

that the latter would not be completely embraced in the application of Fresnel's

formulae, modified to suit an intensely absorbing substance and an angle of inci-

dence given by a sine greater than unity f.

             On a Mechanical Illustration of Thermoelectric Plienomena.
                                By Oliver J. Lodge, B.Sc.

   The model which illustrates metallic conduction in the preceding communica-

tion is supposed to be modified, so that all the buttons execute very rapid isochro-

nous simple harmonic motions, sliding to and fro on the cord. The rate of cooling
of a body placed in an enclosure at absolute zero is then seen to be proportional to
the absolute temperature of the body, and to depend on its specific electrical resist-
ance. The electric condition of tourmaline is explained by an hypothesis as to the
nature of its internal structure ; and the amount of heat generated by an electric

current passing through a metallic conductor is deduced in accordance with Joule's

law. An hypothesis is then started as to the nature of the internal actions at a

junction either of two different metals at the same temperature or of two parts of
the same metal at different temperatures ; and, on the strength of this hypothesis,
electromotive force produced by contact, the Peltier efiect, and Thomson's electric
convection of heat are all illustrated. The exact laws which have been experi-

mentally established for these efiects may possibly be deducible from considerations

founded on the model ; but this has not yet been properly done*.

                     On the Protection of Buildings from Lightning.
                      By Professor J. Clerk Maxwell, F.B.S.

   Most of those who have given directions for the construction of lightning-

conductors have paid gi'eat attention to the upper and lower extremities of the
conductor. They recommend that the upper extremity of the conductor should
extend somewhat above the highest part of the building to be protected, and that
it should terminate in a sharp point, and that the lower extremity should be car-
ried as far as possible into the conducting strata of the ground, so as to " make "
what telegraph engineers call " a good earth."

   The electrical effect of such an arrangement is to tap, as it were, the gathering
charge, by facilitating a quiet discharge between the atmospheric accumulation and
the earth. The erection of the conductor will cause a somewhat greater number
of discharges to occur at the place than would have occurred if it had not been
erected, but each of these discharges will be smaller than those which woidd have

occurred without the conductor. It is probable, also, that fewer discharges will

occur in the region surrounding the conductor. It appears to me that these arrange-

ments are calculated rather for the benefit of the surrounding country, and for the

tection of tlie building- on which the conductor is erected.

   "What we really wish is to prevent the possibility of an electric discharge taking

place within a certain region, say, the inside of a gunpowder manufactory.
   If this is clearly laid down as our object, the method of securing it is equally

clear.

  An electric discharge cannot occur between two bodies unless the difference of

their potentials is suificiently great compared with the distance between them. If,

therefore, we can heep the potentials of all bodies within a certain region equal or

Wenearly equal, no discharge will take place between them.                                                                                             may secure this hj

connecting all these bodies by means of good conductors, such as copper-wire ropes

but it is not necessary to do so ; for it may be shown by experiment that if every

part of the surface surrounding a cei-tain region is at the same potential, every

point within that region must be at the same potential, provided no charged body

IS placed within the region.
   It would therefore be sufficient to surround oiu- powder-mill with a conducting

material (to sheathe its roof, walls, and ground-floor with thick sheet-copper), and
then no electrical effect could occur within it on account of any thunder-storm

outside.

WeThere would be no need of any earth-connexion.  might even place a layer

of asphalt between the copper floor and the groimd, so as to insulate the building.

If the mill were then struck with lightning, it would remain charged for some

time, and a person standing on the ground outside and touching the wall might

receive a shock ; but no electrical effect would be perceived inside, even on the most
delicate electrometer. The potential of every thing inside, with respect to the earth,
would be suddenly raised or lowered, as the case might be ; but electric potential
is not a physical condition, but only a mathematical conception, so that no physical

effect could be perceived.

It is therefore not necessary to connect large masses of metal, such as engines,

tanks, &c., to the walls, if they are entirely within the building.

If, however, any conductor, such as a telegraph-wire or a metallic svipply-pipe for

water or fias, comes into the building from without, the potential of this conductor

may be diflerent from that of the building, unless it is connected with the conducting

shell of the building. Hence the water or gas supply-pipes, if any enter the building,

must  be connected to  the  system  of lightning-conductors                                                                                            and since to connect  a
                                                                                                                                                    ;

telegraph-wire with the conductor would render the telegraph useless, no telegraph

from without should be allowed to enter a powder-mill, though there may be elec-

tric bells and other telegi-aphic apparatus entirely within the building.

   I have supposed the powder-mill to be entirely sheathed in thick sheet-copper.
This, however, is by no means necessaiy in order to prevent any sensible electric

effect taking place within it, supposing it struck by lightning. It is quite sufficient
to enclose the building with a network of a good conducting substance, for in-
stance, if a copper wire, say No. 4, B.W.G. (0-238 inch in diameter), were carried
round the foundation of a house, up each of the corners and gables, and along the
ridges, this would probably be a sufficient protection for an ordinary building

against any thimder-storm in this climate. The copper wire may be built into the

wall to prevent theft, but it should be connected to any outside metal, such as
lead or zinc on the roof, and to metal rain-water pipes.

   In the case of a powder-mill, it might be advisable to make the network closer
by carrying one or two additional wires over the roof and down the walls to the wire
at the foundation. If there are water- or gas-pipes which enter the building from

without, these must be connected with the sj'stem of conducting-wires ; but if there
are no such metallic connexions with distant points, it is not necessary to take any

pains to facilitate the escape of the electricity into the earth.

    It is desirable, however, to provide for the safety not only of the building itself,

but of the system of conductors which protects it. The only parts of this system
which are in any danger are the points where the electricity enters and leaves it.
If, therefore, the system terminates above in a tall rod with a sharp point, and

do-svnwards in an " earth wire," the external discharge will be almost certain to

occur at the ends of these electrodes, and the only possible dan;nge ^^·ill be the loss

stroyed altogether, the building would still be safe.

On the Conditions of the Transformation of Pendalum-Vihrations ; with an

  experimental illustration. By R. H. M. Bosanqtjbt, Fellow of St. John's

College, Oxford.

Under certain circumstances, a pendulum-vibration of given period can give rise

to impulses which support vibrations whose periods are h h h                                 ^f the period

of the original vibration. The conditions under which this tates place are of

interest.                                                                                           · j- ·
AWheatstone
           enunciated the           following  as  an                           .  law  :--  periodic im-

pulse can sustain vibrations whose I'req^uencies are multiples of that of the irnpulse.

This was supported by an experiment in which the harmonics of a Jew's harp
are obtained from it by an adjustable resonator. But a general law cannot be

proved by a particular experiment.

  An experiment was adduced in contradiction of the generality of the above law.

It can be shown that the stopped pipes of the organ are incapable of supportingthe

vibration of resonators tuned to their octave and double octave, while open pipes

are capable of doing so.

   As the result of mechanical theory, the law may be enunciated that no pendulum-

vibration can be maintained in a vibrating system, unless the acting forces contain

impulses of the same period as the vibration maintained.
   The experiments commonly shown, in which a simple pendulum-vibration is

made to support its harmonics, generally depend on a transformation of the vibra-
tion in the transmission of the impulse. The apparatus exhibited forms a type of

the general process of transformation by transmission.

  A metronome vibrating seconds furnishes the fundamental vibration : a number

of small pendulums vibrate 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 times in a second. By making

connexions between the metronome and the pendulums with elastic cord in diffe-

rent ways, the different kinds of transmission (with and without transformation)

can be illustrated.

When the cord        is tight, the  impulses   are transmitted  without                 transformation
                                                                                                                                                     ;

when the cord goes slack during the vibration, the impulses are transformed into a

series of pulls. In the first case the small pendulums are not affected ; in the second

they are generally set in vibration.

   The following points are illustrated by the experiment with the partly slack cord,

where the impulses constitute a series of pulls :

   The common exposition of the theory of musical sounds, in which the impulses

are compared to the blows of a hammer, really makes a very complex effect the
basis of operations. The notes thus constructed differ from sirnple musical tones in

having the power of supporting the vibrations of their harmonics.
   T?he cases of the notes of the siren and the harmonium, in which the sound is

produced by a series of jets of air, are illustrated by the same experiment.

   An experiment of Prof. Mayer's, for the analysis of the sound of a reed pipe, by
--46 REPORT 1876.

attaching a vibrating portion of it to tuning-forks, was discussed. It was shown

that the mode of transmission is such as to lead to transformation, whereby the

analysis is vitiated.

   Mr. J. B.iillie Hamilton's experiment, in which an harmouium-reed is made to

support the vibrations of a wire sounding its harmonics without actual attachment,

was shown to be a case of transformation.

   The production of harmonics by resonance from the Jew's harp or harmonium-
reeds without wind was discussed ; and it was shown that they may be regarded
as giving rise to discontinuous impulses at the moment when they close the open-

ings in which they fit.

   It was then shown how a series of discontinuous impulses may be expressed

mathematically ; and from the fact that the expressions involve pendulum-vibrations
corresponding to the harmonics, it was shown to follow that harmonic vibrations

may be excited by such a series of impulses.

   The nature of the modification the expressions require for application to the siren
was pointed out, and it was thus explained how the siren tone comes to involve

harmonics of considerable intensity.

  We now come to the problem of transformation of simple-sound vibrations by

transmission through air.

  An experiment was described in which a large tuning-fork was presented to a

series of resonators (organ-pipes) tuned to its harmonics ; the result was that, ^vitll
the fork aj^ue, they were audible up to the tierce inclusive (harmonic of lifth order),
and with a disk of wood fastened on to the prong they were audible up to the

harnionic seventh inclusive.

  A mathematical investigation of the transformation of simple vibrations in air

was then cai'ried out, and applied to the above experiment. It results that for the

fiftli harmonic of the fork, which was clearly heard, the flow of energy should be

approximately

               ----;- ---  foot  pounds    p^er  second,
                                 ^
               2x10'"

This seeming extraordinarily minute, an experiment was made with a small tuning-
fork of about the same pitch as the fifth harmonic above mentioned. The time of
diminution of the amplitude to -^-^ was observed and the initial amplitude. From
this the amplitude was calculated at the subsequent time when the sound just
ceased to be audible. The flow of energy per second at this point was estimated

approximately at

               4^^ foot pounds,

which agrees pretty well with the above number deduced from theory.
   It was then pointed out tliat the intensity due to a given flow of energy is diffe-

rent in different parts of the scale. Helmholtz has remarked this (p. 264 of Ellis's
Helraholtz) ; and, in a paper in the 'Philosophical Magazine' (Nov. 1872), the writer

showed that, if we admit that in similar organ-pipes similar proportions of the
energy of the wind supplied are converted into sound, the mechanical energy of

notes of given intensity varies inversely as the vibration number, a law in accordance
with the indications given by Helmholtz.

   The theory was then applied to ascertain the extent of the development of har-
monics in a tubular resonator tuned to the fundamental. Such development turns
out to be very considerable. In consequence of this we cannot generally assume
that the notes produced by resonators are simple tones. The bearing of this on a
recent important paper of KcEuig's was alluded to.

vals ns rapidly decrease : the same number of vibrations which between the Ist and
2nd steps of the harmonic series produce an octave, between 2ud and 3rd step a
fifth, between the 4th and 5th steps a major third, between the 15th and 10th steps

produce only a diatonic semitone, and so onwards beyond the range of musical

computation.
   In contrast with this harmonic series of sounds, which is simple, arithmetical,

and perfectly ref^ular, we have the series of the musical scale, which is compound,

geometrical, and so irregular that two tones or steps of equal vibrations cannot
musically succeed each otlier. Of the 48 sounds in the harmonic series, 22 are

coincident with the musical series, and 26 ai-e not coincident.
   Of these 22 coincidences, the root, or lowest sound of the harmonic series,

occurs as

               The 4th sound of the musical scale             times.

Of these 22 coincidences between the harmonic series and the musical series, the
last are the numbers 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, and 48, which form the relations of

the musical scale.

This full harmonic series can onhj be built upon Fa, or the 4th of the musical

scale, as its root ; and the first power of Fa, 10§ (as it appears in the lowest series

of the musical scale 8, 9, 10, 10§, 12, 13J, 15, 16), is the common multiplier and

                                                                Thus in the octave

from tenor C upwards the vibrations are :

These, divided by the first power of Fa, or the 4th of the musical scale (say 10§),

give 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48, being the figui-es of the musical scale with

which the harmonic series closes.

   In this harmonic series the 8lh, 9th, and 10th tones or steps following in diatonic
succession are the 1st, 2ud, and 3rd tones of the musical scale, and the 15th and 16th

are the 7th and 8th of the musical scale.

These figm-es give us the first or lowest relations of the musical scale, 8 : 9, 9 : 10,

and 15 : 16 :

               The large step or tone of 8 : 9 occurs 3 times.

   These relations of the tones or steps of the scale are always the same in every key.

C, =512 vibrations, is common to the keys of Bj;, F, C, and G; and the 7th or

Ddiatonic semitone below, =480 vibrations, is common to the keys of C, G, and ;

so with every musical tone. Each of these is represented by a digital upon the

natural finger-board of the author's voice-harmonium.

   For distinction the digitals representing tones common to 4 keys are white, those to

3 keys are coloured ; the 1st, 2ud, 4th, and 5th tones of the scale in every key are

white, and the 3rd, 6th, and 7th are coloured.

    In every key, looking along the fingerboard, the progression of the scale is the

same :--8 : 9, 9 : 10, 15 : 10, 8:9, 9 : 10, 8:9, 15 : 16. From white digital to

white, or from coloured to coloured, there is always the large step or tone of the

scale 8:9; from white to coloured always the less tone of the scale 9 : 10 ; and

from coloured to white always the small step or tone 15 : 16, the diatonic semitone.

always the chromatic semitone of 128 : 135, and from the end of each coloured

digital to the end of the white immediately above the comma of 80 : 81 always

appears.

Between each white or flat note, as E|; , and each coloured or sharp note, as DJf,

at the distance of six removes looking across the diagram or finger-board, the schisma

of the scale is always found, 32,768 : 32,805.

The only other relation of the scale is represented by a round digital on the

finger-board and by  7 minor  on  the   diagram                                    it is tuned  as 15 : 16, to the 6th of

the major scale, and supplies the sharpened 7th and 6th tones of the modern minor

scale ; "it also gives the imperfect chromatic semitone of 24 : 25 in relation to the

5th of the major scale.

This finger-board is termed "natural " because no extra digitals lite the five black

digitals of the ordinary keyboard are required to produce the chromatic tones.
Eveiy coloured digital is sharp in relation to the white below it ; and every white
digital is flat in relation to the coloured above it, the relation being always 128 : 135.

   On this finger-board only 4 musical relations, viz. 8 : 9, 9 : 10, 15:6, and 128 : 135,

are found, and 3 musical difierences, viz. 24 : 25, 80 : 81, and 32,768 : 32,805.
   All the larger intervals of the scale are formed by adding 8:9, 9:10, and 15 : 16

together, and all the smaller intervals are produced by subtracting or dividing

these, thus :

          =8 : 9 less 15 : 16     128 : 135,     the chromatic semitone
                                                                                                                                                                ;

          9:10 ,, 15:16= 24 : 25, the imperfect chromatic semitone

          8:9 =,, 9 : 10                80 : 81, the comma ; and

          =8 : 9 ,, 9 : 10        128 : 135, which being

squared and divided by 9 : 10, gives the schisma 32,768 ; 32,805. Thus all the in-
tervals and relations of the musical scale proceed from these three simple elements,

8 : 9, 9 : 10, and 15 : 16.

By adding a comma and a schisma together, the comma of Pythagoras is produced.

This  is  always  found  between  keys  changed  enharmonically,                                as  from                                                           C         to  B.

         On an UnmistaTcahle True North Compass. By G. J. Ststons.

   The aiitlior said that it was not generally known, except to nautical and to
scientific men, that the compasses usually sold did not point to the true North or
South Pole of the earth. The magnetic Pole, to which all compass-needles pointed,
was not identical with the geographical pole, which was the north point of
maps. The variation of the needle was considerable, and was no doubt often
the cause of tourists losing their way. The difference between true and mag^ietic
north was not the same in all parts of the United Kingdom, and a fortiori in all
parts of the globe, nor was it absolutely the same from year to year. One of the
advantages of these instruments was their pointing to the true north, the other
was their " unmistakableness." These compasses were corrected for use in the United
Kingdom, but could be adapted to any specified locality in any part of the world.

0)1 a new Form of Astronomical Clock with Free Pendulum and Indepen-

  dently Governed Uniform Motion for Escapement-iuheel, By Sir "W.

   I^ou^o^, D.C.L., F.B.S.

   The object of this communication was to explain to members of the Association
and give them an opportunity of seeing in the authors house in the_ University a
clock which had been described in a communication to the Royal Society, in 1869,

entitled " On a New Asti'onomical Clock and a Pendulum Governor for Uniform

Motion." The following description is taken from the ' Proceedings of the Royal
Society ' for 1869, except a few alterations and additions and the drawings, which

have not been hitherto published :
   It seems strange that the dead-beat escapement should still hold its place in the

astronomical clock, when its geometrical transformation, the cylinder escapement
of the same inventor, Graham, only survives in Geneva watches of the cheaper class.
For better portable time-keepers it has been altered through the vicious rack-and-
pinion movement into the superlatively good detached lever. If it is possible to
make astronomical clocks go better than at present by merely giving them a better
escapement, it is quite certain that one on the same principle as the detached lever,
or as Earnshaw's ship-chronometer escapement, would improve their time-keeping.

   But the irregularities hitherto tolerated in astronomical clocks may be due more

to the faultiness of the steel and mercury compensation pendulum, with its loosely

attached glass jar, and of the mode in which it is hung, and of the instability of

the supporting clock-case or framework, than to imperfection of the escapement
and the greatness of the arc of vibration which it requires ; therefore it would be

wrong to expect confidently much improvement in the time-keeping merely from

improvement of the escapement. I have therefore endeavoured to improve both
the compensation for change of temperature in the pendulum, and the mode of its

support, in a clock which I have recently made with an escapement on a new prin-
ciple, in which the simplicity of the dead-beat escapement of Graham is retained,

while its great defect, the stopping of the whole train of wheels by pressure of a

tooth upon a surface moving with the pendulum, is remedied.
   Imagine the escapement-wheel of a common dead-beat clock to be mounted on a

collar fitting easily upon a shaft, instead of being rigidly attached to it. Let friction
be properly applied between the shaft and the collar, so that the wheel shall be
carried round by the shaft unless resisted by a force exceeding some small definite
                             --

amount, and let a governor giving uniform motion be applied to the train of wheel-

work connected with this shaft, and so adjusted that, when the escapement-wheel

is um-esisted, it will move faster by a small percentage than it must move to keep

time properly. Now let the escapement-wheel, thus mounted and carried round,

act upon the escapement, just as it does in the ordinary clock. It will keep the

pendulum vibrating, and wiU, just as in the ordinary clock, be held back every

time it touches the escapement during the interval required to set it right again

from having gone too fast during the preceding interval of motion. But in the

ordinary clock the interval of rest is considerable, generally greater tlian the inter-

val of motion. In the new clock it is equal to a small fraction of the interval of

motion ^}o in the clock as now working, but to be i-educed probably to something
much smaller yet. The simplest appliance to count the turns of this escapement-

wheel (a worm, for instance, working upon a wheel with thirty teeth, carrying a

hand round, which will correspond to the seconds hand of the clock) completes the

instrument ; for minute- and hour-hands are a superfluity in an astronomical clock.

In various trials which I have made since the year 1865, when this plan of es-

capement first occurred to me, I have used several different forms, all answering to

the preceding description, although differing widely in their geometrical and me-

chanical characters. In all of them the escapement-wheel is reduced to a single
tooth or arm, to diminish as much as possible the moment of inertia of the mass

stopped by the pendulum. This arm revolves in the period of the pendulum (two

seconds for a seconds pendulum), or some multiple of it. Thus the pendu-

lum may execute many complete periods of vibration without being touched
by the escapement. In all my trials the pallets have been attached to the bottom

of the pendulum, projecting below it, in order that satisfactory action with a very

small arc of vibration (not more on each side than ^ j^^ of the radius, or 1 centi-

metre for the seconds pendulum) may be secured.

  In the clock in my house the seconds pendulum of the fine movement vibrates with

great constancy through half a millimetre, that is to say, through an arc of ^i^ of the

radian on each side of the vertical. This, I believe, is the smallest range that has

hitherto been realized in any seconds pendulum of an astronomical or other clock.

In the drawing s represents the vertical

escapement-shaft, round which is fitted loosely

the coUar c, carrying the worm v. The

small wheel, d, is worked by v, and carries

round the seconds hand of the clock, a repre-

sents a piece of fine steel wire, being the single

arm to which the teeth of the escapement-

wheel are reduced in the clock described in

pendulum ; /, a foot bearing the weight of the
collar-worm and escapement-tooth. The bar

connecting/ with the collar is of such a length

as to give a proper moment to the frictional

force by which the collar is carried round.

wheel-work (not shown in the drawing) from

the governor. This wheel is made to go ^
per cent, faster than once round in two seconds,

while the pendulum prevents the cpllar from

going round more than once in two seconds.

from 1865 until a few months ago by the

difficulty of obtaining a satisfactory governor

Imagine a pendulum with single tootli escapement mounted on a collar loose on

the escapement-shaft just as described above, the shaft being vertical in this case
Aalso.
        square-threaded screw is cut on the upper quarter of the length of

the shaft, this being the part of it on which the escapement-collar works ; and a

pin fixed to the collar projects inwards to the furrow of the screw, so that, if the

collar IS turned relatively to the shaft, it will be carried along as the nut of a screw,

but with less friction than an ordinary nut. Below the screw and long nut-collar

three-quarters of the length of the escapement-shaft is surrounded by a tube which

by wheel-work is carried round about 5 per cent, faster than the central shaft.

This outer shaft, by means of friction produced by the pressure of proper springs,

carries the nut-collar round along with it, except when the escapement-tooth ia

Astopped by either of the pallets attached to the peudidum.    stiff cross-piece

(like the head of a T), projecting each way from the top of the tubular shaft, carries,
tanging down from it, the governing masses of a centrifugal friction governor.

These masses are drawn towards the axis by springs, the inner ends of which are

acted on by the nut-collar, so that the higher or the lower the latter is in its range

Athe springs pull the masses inwards with less or more force.  fixed metal ring

coaxial -svith the main shaft holds the governing masses in when their centrifugal

forces exceed the forces of the springs, and resists the motion by forces of friction

increasing approximately in simple proportion to the excess of the speed above that

which just balances the forces of the springs. As long as the escapement-tooth

is imresisted the nut-collar is carried round with the quicker motion of the outer

tubular shaft, and so it screws iqnvards, diminishing the force of the springs. Once

every semiperiod of the pendulum it is held back by either pallet, and the nut-col-
lar screws down as much as it rose during the preceding interval of freedom, when

the action is regular; and the central or main escapement-shaft turns in the same

period as the tooth, being the period of the pendulum. If through increase or

diminution of the driving-power, or diminution or increase of the coefficient of

friction between the governing masses and the ring on which they press, the shaft

tends to turn faster or slower, the nut-collar works its way down or up the screw,

until the governor is again regulated, and gives the same speed in the altered cir-

cumstances. It is easy to arrange that a large amount of regulating power shall

be implied in a single turn of the nut-collar relatively to the central shaft, and yet

that the periodic application and removal of about yV of this amount in the half-
period of the pendulum shall cause but a very small periodic variation in the speed.
The latter important condition is secured by the great moment of inertia of the

governing masses themselves round the main shaft. My communication to the

Royal Society ended as follows :

   "I hope after a few months trial to be able to present a satisfactory report of the

performance of the clock now completed according to the principles explained
above. As many of the details of execution may become modified after practical

trial, it is unnecessary that I should describe them minutely at present. Its general

appearance, and the arrangement of its characteristic parts, may be understood
from the photograph now laid before the Society."

   I am sorry to say that the hope here expressed has not hitherto been realized.

Year after year passed producing only more or less of radical reform in various me-

chanical details of the governor and of the fine movement, until about six months

ago, when, for the first time, I had all except the pendulums in approximately

satisfactory condition. By that time I had discovered that my choice of zinc and

platinum for the temperature compensation and lead for the weight of the pendu-
lums was a rnistake. I had fallen into it about ten years ago through being in-

formed that in Kussia the gridiron pendulum had been reverted to because of the

difficulty of getting equality of temperature throughout the length of the pendu-

lum; and without stopping to perceive that the right way to deal with this diffi-
culty was to face it and take means of securing practical equality of temperature

throughout the length of the penduliun (which it is obvious may be done by

simple enough appliances), I devised a pendulum in which the compensation is

produced by a stiff tube of zinc and a platinum wire placed nearly parallel each to the

other throughout the length of the pendulum ; and the two pendulums of the clock

Nowshown to the British Association were constructed on this plan.  it is clear
--52 REPORT 1876.

that the materials chosen for compensation should, of all those not otherwise oh-
jectionable, he those of greatest and of least expansibility. Therefore, certainly,
glass or platinum ought to be one of the materials ; and the steel of the ordinary
astronomical mercury pendulum is a mistake. Mercury ought to be the other (its
cubic expansion being six times the linear expansion of zinc), unless the capillary
uncertainty of the mercury surface lead to irregular changes in the rate of the pen-
dulum. I'he weight of the pendulum ought to be of material of the greatest spe-
cific gravity attainable, at all events unless the whole is to be mounted in an air-
tight case, because one of the chief errors of the best existing pendulums is that

depending on the variations of barometric pressm-e. The expense of platinum puts
it out of the question for the weight of the pendulum, even although the use of
mercmy for the temperature compensation did not also give mercury for the weight.
Thus even though as good compensation could be got by zinc and platinum as by
any other means, mercury ought, ou account of its superior specific gi-avity, to be
preferred to lead for the weight of the pendulum.

   I have accordingly now made several pendulums (for tide-gauges) with no other
material in the mo\dng part than glass and mercuiy, with rounded Icnife-edges of
agate for the fixed support ; and I am on the point of making four more for two
new clocks which I am having made on the plan which forms the subject of this

communication. I have had no opportunity hitherto of testing the performance of
 any of these pendulums ; but their .action seems very promising of good results,
 and the only untoward circumstance which has hitherto appeared in connexion
with them has been breakages of the glass in two attempts to have one cairied
 safely to Genoa for a tide-gauge made by Mr. White to an order for the Italian
 Government.

   As to the acciu'acy of my new clock, it is enough to look at the pendulum vi-

 brating with perfect steadiness, from month to month, through a range of half a
 centimetre on each side of its middle position, with its pallets onlj'' touched dm'ing
 ^Jg of the time by the escapement-tooth, to feel certain that, if the best ordinary
 astronomical clock owes any of its irregidaiities to variations of range of its pen-
 dulum, or to impulses and friction of its escapement-wheel, the new clock must,
 when tried with an equally good pendulum, prove more regular. I hope soon to
 have it tried vdth a better pendulum than that of any astronomical clock hitherto
 made ; and if it then shows irregularities amounting to -fV of those of the best as-
 tronomical clocks, the next step must be to inclose it in an air-tight case kept at
 constant temperature, day and night, summer and winter.

  On Tidal Ojyerations in the Gulf of Catch hi/ the Great Trigonometrical Survey

                        of India. By Capt. A. W. Baird, B.E.

     The primary object of the operations was to determine whether secular changes
  in the level of the land at the head of the Gulf, i. e. the " Runn of Cutch," are
  taking place. Col. Walker, the Superintendent of the Great Trigonometrical Survey
  of India, at first intended to restrict the observations to a few weeks duration ; but
  he found that by extending them to a period of a little over a year, scientific re-
  sidts of the highest value would be obtained, and also that this course would be
  necessary in order to obtain data sufiicient to detect minute changes in the relative
  level of land and sea. I was deputed when in England in 1871 to study the details
  of tidal observations and harmonic analj'sis as recommended by the British Asso-
  ciation; at the same time I tested a new self-registering tide-gauge, the per-
  formances of which were very satisfactory. The self-registering tide-gauges were
  then described at length, the most remarkable feature in them being the unusually

long barrels (length 5 feet), whicli were proTided in order to give the tidal curves
on the diagi'am on a very large scale. Six of these instruments had been sent out
to India some years before ; they were modified in Bombay, so as to be similar to

the new one which was tested at Chatham, and had scales of wheels put on for

adaptation to particular tides, friction-rollers for the barrel, zero-hnea for time and

height cut, &c. As the rise and fall of the tide is materially influenced by direction

and force of the wind, and also hj clianges in the barometer, self-registering anemo-

meters and barometers were procured for each tidal station. On my return to

India I was ordered to make a reconnaissance of the Gulf of Cutch, to select sites
for tidal stations. I cruised about for a month in a common native sailing-boat,

--and after long searching along the muddy foreshores of the Gulf I found three

places well adapted for tidal observations one right at the head of the Gulf, just

in the Runn of Cutch, called Haustal Tidal Station ; another midwaj^ up the Gulf
of the Cutch coast, called Nowanar ; and the third, Okha, just at the mouth of the
Gulf, opposite the island of Beyt. They were well situated for the purposes required,
as far as their geogi'aphical position ; but as one was at a point twenty miles from the

nearest village (from which drinking-water had to be brought by boat as well as

food for the men in charge), another station nine miles, and the third two miles

from the villages, the arrangements for the continuous working of the stations for

about a year and a half had to be most carefully made. I returned to Bombay and

got all the apparatus ready, such as iron cylinders in length (so as to be portable),

iron piping, suction-piping, anchors, and buoys, &e. for the deep-sea connexion,

--temporary tide-gauges for comparison, portable observatories in fact every thing,

even to bricks and lime for sinking the masonry well for holding the cylinders, for

nothing could be procured in the places selected for the stations. While in Bom-
bay I tested the working of the whole apparatus for each observatory, and made
many modifications fi'om time to time. I found that air would collect in the pipes,

which were in the shape of a long siphon, and thus cause differences of level in
the cylinder and the sea. I overcame this difiicult}' by inserting stopcocks at the

top bends, which were to be always below the lowest high-water ; and in this way
I was able to get the same level of the water inside the cylinder as in the open
sea. By frequent comparison with the temporary tide-gauges, the identity of level

was determined ; the size of the pipe connecting the cylinder had been calculated,
so that practically there would be no retardation in the flow of the water. The
native sub-surveyors, who were to be in charge of the stations, were also trained
in Bombay.

   The observations and apparatus were then described at length, and several illus-
trations and diagrams showed the method of their working. In addition to the
self-registering anemometer and self-registering aneroid barometer, each observatory
was fitted out with a standard mercurial barometer (for comparisons) and a rain-
gauge. Three bench mark-stones in masonry platforms, at different distances from
the observatory, were built as standard points for the levels, and each carefully
connected with the zero of the self-registering tide-gauge. The whole of the appa-
ratus and instruments were sent ofl^ in a large native sailing-vessel direct to Okha,
the natives who were to be employed also going. I marched across Kattyanon to
 Okha, having made some arrangements with the Political Agent at Rajkot as to the
help we should get from the native states. The construction of Okha tidal station
was then described, and many of the difficulties which were successfully overcome;
 also the different methods of comparing position of pencil on diagram with the
height of water ; checks on the working of the instruments for insertion in the daily
 reports submitted by the sub-surveyors. 1 detected a serious fault in the self-

registering tide-gauge, viz. that the instrument was by no means correct in the
 time registration. I eventually devised a simple, plan which I called " back-lash

weight," which completely removed this cause of error : I am of opinion this plan
ought to be carried out in its entiretj^, and the barrel made to drive the clock in-

stead of the clock the barrel.

    Just after all was ready, and the instruments being started at Okha, a great dis-

Aaster happened early one morning. boat drifted dovm past the station, her anchor

 dragged across the flexible pipe, smashed it, and carried oft" a large portion of it, as

well as buoys, anchoi-, &c. Here we had to land and to have the repairs quickly

executed ; then the final measurements for determination of zero, rating of clocks,

& c. were made, and the instrments started on their eighteen months' work.
Leaving Okha, the vessel in which I and my men and all the apparatus were in

ran straio-ht on to a sandbank and nearly capsized. After many troubles, the other
two stations were eventually constructed. Huts had to be made for the men in

charo-e and the guard from the native state to live in, a regular service for sending

food and water established, and post-runners started to carry the daily reports to

the nearest post-office, and many other details arranged. I or my European as-

sistant had to make frequent tours of inspection of the stations while work was

going on, which entailed much hard marching and exposure. One journey (in May
1874) was described in which I and my assistant had to ride on camels over about

fourteen miles of the Runn, covered with water from 6 inches to a foot deep, in

order to reach Haustal Tidal Station. The working of the stations was then de-

scribed, Okha and Haustal giving perfect and continuous registration ; but at

Nowanar, where there was 20 feet of water at the end of the pipe at low-water in

April 1874, in the following July it silted up and buried the pipe, and the whole

configuration of the foreshore altered. New pipes had to be got up, and two

lunations (from March to May 1875) were secured, in addition to the one and half

lunation got before the shore had altered, in 1874. The registrations of the ane-

mograph and barograph were continuous also. The levelling operations (750 miles

of double levelling were done in connexion with the work) were next noticed ; the

rigid method of procedure which obtains in the Great Trigonometrical Survey of

India, and which give such wonderfully accurate results, was referred to (vide Col.

Walker's paper in vol. xxxiii. of the Memoirs of the Astron. Society).

The reductions of the tidal observations are in progi-ess, some idea of the magni-

tude of which may be imagined when 30,000 points have been con-ected to true

mean local time on the diagram-sheets, corrections made for zero error, and then

the 30,000 final measurements made and tabulated for reduction. The determina-

tion of the mean level of the sea at each station and some of the results already

deduced are stated : one is important, and that is, that the mean level deduced from

the two months (March 7 to May 7) is nearly identical with the mean of the whole

ear; and this Col. Walker had predicted would be the case in a letter on the subject

about eight years before. The meteorological reductions are in progress. The

movement of the wind for each hour for the whole period has been tabulated and

reduced to its N.  and  E.  components, the  mean  hourly  value  determined                                                        and,  by
                                                                                                                                 ;

combining the differences of this mean from the value of each particular hour, and

similarly the barometric differences with the differences of the theoretical and

actual values of the tide, I hope to determine far more accurately than has yet

been done the effect of the wind and barometer on the tide. Several tracings of

the actual diagrams were exhibited. The tidal curves are most regular and con-

tinuous, and show the perfect working of the whole apparatus ; and when the tidal

and meteorological reductions are complete, I hope to obtain some very valuable

results.

                       CHEMISTET.

Address by "William Henet Peekin, F.R.S., President of the Section.

Thkbe can be no doubt that chemistry and the allied sciences are now being re-
cognized to a much greater extent in this country than in former years ; and not

only so, the workers at research, though still small in number, are more numerous

than they were.

   In 1868 Dr. Frankland, in his Address to this Section at the Meeting at Norwich,
commented upon the small amount of original research then being carried on in the

United Kingdom but, judging from the statistics of the Chemical Society, this
                                                                                                   ;

state of things became even worse ; for in 1868 there were forty-eight papers read

before the Society, but in 1872 only twenty-two. Since then, however, there has
been a considerable increase in the number ; and at the Anniversary Meeting in
March last it was shown that the number of communications for the session had

risen to sixty-six, or three times as many as in 1872.
   Of course these figures only refer to the Chemical Society ; but I think they may

be taken as a very safe criterion of the improved state of things, though it would
be very gratifying to see much gi-eater activity.

   It is also very pleasing to find that the aids to and opportunities for research are
increasing, because it must be remembered that, in a pecimiary sense, science is

far from being its own rewarder at the time its truths are being studied, although
the results very often become eventually of the greatest practical value ; hence the
wisdom of a country encouraging scientific research.

 --But little, however, has been done in this direction in past years the grants

made for general science by this Association, and that of the Government of one
thousand pounds annually to the Royal Society, being the most important.

   The Chemical Societj' has also been in the habit of giving small grants for the

purpose of assisting those engaged in chemical research. In the future, however, it

will be able to do much more than hitherto. One of the original members of the

Society, Dr.LongstafF, offered intheearlypart of the year to give one thousand pounds
provided a similar sum could be raised, the united amount to be invested and the

interest applied for the encouragement of research. I am happy to say that rather
more than the required sum has been raised, and it is hoped that it may be still

fm'ther supplemented.

   In addition to the Royal-Society grant, the Government have given this year a
further annual sum of four thousand pounds. Of com'se this is for science gene-

rally.

   Mr. T. J. Phillips Jodi-eU has also placed at the disposal of the Royal Society

the munificent sum of six thousand pounds to be applied in any manner that they
may consider for the time being most conducive to the encouragement of research

in Physical sciences.

  When we consider how much of our science is of a physical nature, we must be

grateful for this bequest ; and it is to be hoped tliat these helps will more and more
stimulate research in the United Kingdom ; and if we have any hope of keeping pace

with the large amount of work now being carried on in other countries, we must

indeed be energetic.

The employment of well-trained chemists in chemical works is now becoming

much more general than heretofore, especially on the continent, where in some

cases a considerable staff is employed and provided with suitable appliances, &c.,

for the purpose not only of attending to and perfecting the ordinary operations

which are in use, but to make investigations in relation to the class of manufacture
Athey are engaged in.
                       conviction of the necessity of this is gaining strength in

this country, though not so quickly as might be desired ; nevertheless these things

ai'e encouraging.

   With reference to the progress of chemistry and what have been the fi'uits of re-
search of late years, it will be impossible for me to give even a general outline,

the amount of work being so large ; in fact, to recount the list of investigations

made during the past year would take up most of the time at my disposal.

in the aromatic series of organic bodies ; and it is probable that a more intimate

knowledge of this subject will be found of really practical value.

  As I am unable to give an account of the worK done during the past year on

account of its quantity and diversity, I propose to refer to some of the practical results

which have already accrued from Org-anic Chemistry, as a plea for the encourage-

ment of research ; and those I intend to speak of are of special interest also on

account of their close connexion with the textile manufactures of Great Britain. I

need scarcely say I refer to the colouring-matters which have been obtained from

the products found in tar.

   It was in 1856, now twenty years since, that this industry was commenced by
the discovery of the "mauve" or "aniline pm-ple;" and it may be of interest to

state that it was in Scotland, in the autumn of the same year, that the first experi-

ments upon the application of this dye to the arts of dj'eing and calico-printing

were made, at Perth and Maryhill.

   I need scarcely remind you of the wonderful development of this industry since

then, seeing we now have from the same source colourmg-matters capable of pro-

ducing not only all the colours of the rainbow, but their combinations. I wish,

however, to brieily refer to the date and origin of the products which have

served to build tip this great industrj\

It was in 1825 that Faraday published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' hia

research on the oily products separated in compressing oil-gas, and described a

substance he obtained from it^a volatile colourless oil, which he called Bicar-

buretted Hydrogen. Mitscherlich some years afterwards obtained the same sub-
stance from benzoic acid, and gave it the name it bears, viz. " Benzol." This same

chemist further obtained from benzol nitrobenzol, by acting upon it with nitric

acid. Zinin afterwards studied the action of reducing agents upon nitrobenzol, and

obtained "aniline," which he at that time called Benzidam.

   Again, Pelletier and Walter discovered the hydrocarbon toluol in 1837. Deville

produced its uitro-compound in 1841 ; and Hofmann and Muspratt obtained from

this "toluidine," by the process used by Zinin to reduce nitrobenzol.

   I might mention other names in connexion with these substances, such as Eunge
and Unverdorben ; but I would now ask, did any of these chemists make these
investigations with the hope of gain ? was it not rather ti-om the love of research,
and that alone ? and now these products, which were then practically useless, are
the basis of the aniline colours. But to go further : Doebereiner a long while ago
obtained from alcohol a substance which he called "light oxygen ether," now

known as aldehyd. Gay-Lussac produced iodide of ethyl in 1815. Dumas and

Peligot discovered  the  corresponding substance iodide of                                                                                                    methyl in  1835                        but, aa
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

in the cases I have previously referred to, these bodies had no practical value and

were never prepared but in the laboratory. Hofmann, in his researches on the

molecular constitution of the volatile organic bases, discovered in 1850 the

replacement compounds of aniline containing alcohol radicals.

All these compounds have now been manufactured on the large scale and used

in the further development of the industry of these artificial colouring-matters.

Other substances    might  be mentioned                                                                                                                       but I think these are sufficient       to  show
                                                                                                      ;

how the products of research which, when first discovered and for a long period

afterwards, were of only scientific interest, at last became of great practical value
and it is evident that, liad not the investigations and discoveries I have referred to
been made as they were solely from a love of science, no aniline colours would

now be known.

The colouring-matters I have hitherto spoken of are nitrogenous, and derived

from benzol and its homologues. There are a few others, however, of the same

origin which contain no nitrogen                                                                                                                              but they are of secondary importance.
                                                                                                                                                           ;

I now pass on to another class of colouring-matter, which is obtained from

anthracene, a coal-tar product diflering from benzol and toluol in physical cha-
racters, inasmuch as it is a magnificent crystalline solid.

The first colouring-matter derived from anthracene which I wish to draw your

attention to is alizarin, the principal dyeing agent found in madder-root. This

substance was for a long time supposed to be related to naphthaline, inasmuch as
                                                                                                                                                       ;;:

phthalic acid can be produced from botli of them ; and many were the experiments
made by chemists in this direction ; it was not, however, until 1808 that this was
proved to be a mistake, and its relationship to anthracene was discovered by Graebe
and Liebermann, who succeeded in preparing this coal-tar product from the natural

alizarin itself.

   Having obtained this important result, they turned their attention further to the
subject, hoping to find some process by which alizarin could be produced from
anthracene in this they were soon successful.

                                                              ;

   The discovery of the artificial formation of alizarin was of great interest, inas-
much as it was another of those instances which have of late years become so
numerous, namely the formation of a vegetable product artificially ; but the process
used by Graebe and Liebermann was of little practical value, because too expensive

for practical purposes.

   Ha-^ing previously worked on anthracene derivatives, it occurred to me to make

some experiments on this subject, which resulted in the discovery of a process by
which the colouring-matter could be economically produced on the large scale
Messrs. Caro, Graebe, and Liebermann about the same time obtained similar
results in Germany ; this was in 18G9. Fm-ther investigation during that year

yielded me a new process, by which " dichloranthracene '' could be used in

place of the more costly product anthraquinone, which was required by the
original processes. I mention this, as most of the artificial alizarin used in this
country up to the end of 1873, and a good deal since, has been prepared by this
new process.

   It was observed that when commercial artificial alizarin prepared from anthra-
quinone, but more especially from dichloranthracene, was used for dyeing, the
colours produced difl:ered from those dyed with madder or pure alizarin ; and many
persons therefore concluded that the artificial colouring-matter was not alizarin at all.
This question, however, was set at rest by separating out the pure artificial alizarin
from the commercial product and compaiing it with the natural alizarin, when it
was found to produce exactly the same colours on mordanted iiibrics, to have the

same composition, to give the same reactions with reagents, and to yield the same

products on oxidation.

But whilst examming into this subject it was foimd that a second colouring-matter

was present in the commercial product, and in somewhat large quantities, especially

when dichloranthracene had been employed in its preparation ; and to this was due

the difierence in shade of colour referred to.

This substance, when investigated, was found to have the same composition as

"purpurin," also a colouring- matter found in madder, but of very little value on

account of the looseness and dulness of some of the colom-s it produces. This new

substance, being derived from  anthracene, was  named  anthrapurpurin                                                                          unlike  its
                                                                                                                                            ;

isomer pm-purin, however, it is of great value as a coloming-matter. I do not

think I shall be going beyond the results of experience if I say it is of as great

importance as alizarin itself; with alumina mordants it produces reds of a more

scarlet or fiery red than those from alizarin. In fact so fine are the colours
produced that, with ordinary alumina-mordants on unoiled cotton, it gives results
nearly equal in brilliancy to Tm-key-red produced with madder or garancine ; and
I believe the rapid success of artificial alizarin was gi-eatlj^ due to its presence.
Most of that consumed at first was for Turkey-red dyeing ; and the coloiu'S were so
clear that it was mostly used in combination with madder or garancine, to brighten
up the colom-s produced b}' these natural products.

   The pm-ple colours anthrapiu'purin produces with iron mordants are bluer in

shade than those of alizai-in, and the blacks are very intense. Its application is

practically the same as alizarin, so that they can be used in combination.

   As already noticed, the commercial product called "artificial alizarin " first

supplied to the consumer was always a mixture of alizarin and anthrapurpurin

and various mixtures of these two colouring-matters are still sent into the market

but, owing to the investigations that have been made and the study and attention

that has been given to it by manufacturers, nearly pure alizarin and anthi-a purpurin

are also sent into the market--the first being known as " blue-shade alizarin," and

the second as red or " scarlet alizarin."

   The formation of antlirapurpurin in tlie manufacture of alizarin may to some

extent te said to have arisen from a want of knowledge of the true conditions

required for the production of the latter.

   It is now well known that alizarin is a dioxyanthraquinone, or, in other words,

anthraquinone in which two atoms of hydrogen are replaced by hydroxyl.

  If we want to introduce hydroxyl into a compoimd, there are several processes

which can be used ; but I will only refer to those connected with the history of

this colouring-matter.

The first process which I will refer to has been used by chemists for a long

period. It consists in first replacing the hydrogen by bromine, and then treating

the resulting body with potassic or other metallic hydrate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and     according  as one,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

two, or more atoms of hydrogen have been replaced by the bromine, so on

its removal by the metal of the metallic hydi-ate, a compound containing a corre-
sponding number of atoms of hydrogen replaced by hydroxyl is obtained.

Graebe and Liebermann acted upon this principle in their experiments on the

artificial formation of alizarin ; and as it was necessary to replace two atoms

of hydrogen in anthraquinone, they first of all prepared a dibrominated derivative,

called dibromanthraquinone,

                                                                                                                                                                           C,,H,Br,0,.

By decomposing this with potassic hydrate at a high temperature, they obtained a
violet-coloured product, which, when acidified to remove the alkali, gave a yellow

precipitate of alizarin,

                                                C,,He(HO),0,.

   The second process I wish to speak of for the replacement of hydrogen by hydroxvl
in a compound is by converting it into a sulpho-acid (usually by means of sulphunc

acid), and subsequently decomposing this with potassic or other hydrate ; and
according as a mono- or disulpho-acid is employed, it yields on decomposition a
compound with one or two atoms of hydrogeji replaced by hydroxyl.

The discovery of sulpho-acids of anthraquinone, and their use in place of the

brominated derivative originally employed by Graebe and Liebermann, constituted
the great improvement in the manufacture of alizarin already referred to.

   From what has just been stated, it was naturally supposed that a disulpho-

acid of anthraquinone would be required to produce alizarin ; and this was believed

to be the case for some time                                                                                                                                               but further experiments have proved it to be a
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

mistake, and shown that the monosulpho-acid is requhed to produce alizarin, the

disulpho-acid yielding anthrapurpurin.

But how are we to explain this apparent anomaly ? It would take up too much

time to enter into a discussion respecting the constitution of the sulpho-acids of

anthraquinone in reference to the position of the HSO3 groups. I will therefore
confine my remarks to their decomposition.

Monosulphoanthraquinonic acid,

                                                                                                                                                                           C,,H,(IIS03)0,,

when heated strongly with caustic alkali, as potassic or sodie hydi-ate, decomposes
in the ordinary way, and we get "monoxyanthraquinone,"

                                                                                                                                                                           0,JI,(HO)0,,

which is a yellow body possessing no dyeing properties. On further treating this,

however, with caustic alkali it changes, being oxidized, and yields alizarin,

    Disulphoanthraquinonic acid,

                                          C,,H,(HS03)0,,

when subjected to the influence of caustic alkali, at first changes into an intermediate

acid,

                                      C,.H,(H0)(HS03)0,,
                          TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  59

and then into a dioxyanthraqiiinone,

                                            C,,He(HO),0,,

--now known as " isoanthraflavic acid" a substance having the same compositioa

as alizarin, but being only an isomer of that body and possessing no affinity for
mordants ; like monoxyanthraquiuone, however, when further heated with alkali
it becomes oxidized and yields a colouring-matter, which is " anthrapm-pm-in,"

                          Ci,Hg (110)3 O,.

Looking at these reactions, it appears rather remarkable that Graebe and

Liebermann should have succeeded in preparing alizarin from dibromanthraquinone.

It can only be explained on the assumption that the hydrogen atoms replaced in the

disulpho-acidare different in position from those replaced in the dibromanthraquinone;

and of course it is possible that a disulpho-acid isomeric with that now known may

be discovered that will yield alizarin as a first product on treatment with alkali.

   In the reaction which takes place when monoxyanthraquinone or isoanthraflavic

acid become oxidized and change into alizarin and anthrapurpurin nascent hydrogen

--is formed ; and this causes a reverse action to take place ordinary anthraquinone,

or its hydrogen derivative, being formed, and a loss of colouring-matter resulting.

A small amount of potassic chlorate is now used with the caustic alkali, just suffi-

cient to overcome the reducing action, which has resulted in an increased yield of

colouring-matter, the percentage obtained being now not very much below the

theoretical quantity.

  When the process for making commercial artificial alizarin by treating anthra-

quinone with sulphuric acid was first adopted, the product from that treatment was

a mixture of the mono- and disulpho-acids of anthraquinone. Consequently the

colouring-matter prepared in this manner was a mixture of alizarin and anthrapur-

purin                     and the reason why dichloranthracene, when used in place of anthraquinone,
                       ;

yields a product very rich in anthrapurpurin, is on account of the readiness with

which it forms a disulpho-acid of dichloranthracene, which afterwards changes into

the disulpho-acid of anthraquinone.

At first it was supposed by many that the quantity of coal-tar produced would

not yield a sufficient supply of anthracene for the manufacture of artificial alizarin.

Experience has, however, proved that this supposition was groundless, as now the

supply is greater than the demand.

Moreover some very interesting experiments have lately been made, by which

anthraquinone and its deiivatives have been obtained without the use of anthracene.

The most interesting are those in which phthalic anhydride is employed with

benzolic derivatives; for example, this anhydride gives with hydroquinone a

colouring-matter having the same composition, as well as most of the other

properties of alizarin. It is called quinizarin. Baeyer and Caro have also obtained

from phthalic anhydride and phenol oxyanthraquinone ; and by using pyrocatechin

in place of phenol they got alizarin itself.

   Although these products have not been obtained in sufficient quantities by
these processes to be of any practical value, we do not know what further researcli

may do. Already one of the substances used is being prepared on the large scale for

the manufacture of that beautiful colouring-matter "eosine;" I refer to phthalic

anhydride.

Now, with reference to the origin of the products which are used for the manvi-

facture of artificial alizarin, we find the first researches made in reference to
anthracene were by Dumas and Laurent in 1832 ; subsequently Laurent further

worked upon this subject, and obtained, by the oxidation of this hydrocarbon, a

substance which he called anthracenuse ; he also obtained dichloranthracene. Dr.
Anderson also made an investigation on anthracene and its compounds in 1863, and

assigned to it its correct formula ; he reexamined its oxidation-product, which

Laurent called anthracenuse, and named it oxyanthracene, the substance we now
know as anthraquinone.

   All tiiese substances were without any practical value until 18G8 ; but we now

find them of the greatest importance, and used daily in immense quantities.

research, it will be well perhaps to see what has been their influence on the colour-

ing-matters which were in use before them, and also the extent of their present

consumption.

The influence of the so-called aniline colours on dye woods, &c. has been

remarkably small. It is true that at first mag-enta had a depreciating influence

upon cochineal ; but this has passed away, and now the consumption of that dye
is as great as ever ; certainly its price is much lower than it used to be ; but this is

due to a variety of causes, especially the great increase in the cultivation of the

insect at Teneriffe. And perliaps this want of influence is not so very remarkable,
when we consider the aniline colours are entirely new products, diSering in com-

position and properties from the old coloming-matters, and therefore could only

displace them to a certain extent.

But whilst this is the case, the aniline colours have been more and more used,

imtil at present it is computed that their annual sale in the United Kingdom and
on the Continent exceeds £2,000,000. This is probably due to new applications

and increase of trade.

When, however, we come to consider the influence of the anthracene colom'S

alizarin and authrapurpurin, more generally known as " artificial  wealizarin,'"  find

we have a very different tale to tell.
   Here, in the case of alizarin, we have a competition not between two colouring-

--matters, but the same from different sources the old source being the madder-

root, the new one coal-tar. And when we introduce the consideration of authra-
purpurin, which produces such magnificent reds, much brighter than alizarin or

ordinary purpurin, we see we have not only a replacement but an improvement,

so that these new colouring-matters throw "the old ones into the shade. The pro-

ducts being purer, the clearing processes for goods dyed with them are also

necessarily easier and simpler.

It will be interesting to examine into the statistics of the madder and garancin

trade in a brief manner, to see what has been the iuffuence of artificial alizarin on

their consumption. The following figures are mostly calculated from the Board-of-

Trade returns.

   During the ten years immediately preceding the introduction of artificial alizarin

the average annual imports of madder into the United Kingdom were 15,292 tons,

and of garancin 2278 tons. Estimating the value of the former at £2 2s. Qd., and

the latter at £8 per cwt., which were about the average prices during tliat period,

the annual value in round numbers was about one million sterling.

   The introduction of artificial alizarin, however, has so influenced the value of
madder that its price is now less than one half; and thus a saving of over half a

million sterling per annum lias been effected to the manufacturers of the United

Kingdom, one half of which may be put down to Glasgow.

So much for its eflfect in reducing prices ; but what has been its influence on the

consumption of these dj'e-stuft's ?

I have already stated the average quantity of these substances imported per

annum prior to the discovery of the artificial product, and will now compare it

with the imports of last year and this. That for the present year of course will be

an estimated quantity, and calculated from the returns for the first seven months.

These figures speak for themselves.

   The money value, which was formerly £1,000,000 per annum, is now, cal-

culating from the estimated quantity for the year, only £138,105, say £140,000,
taking garancin at £4 per cwt. and madder at £1 per cwt., prices slightly in

excess of their present value.

   At the present prices the cultivation of madder-roots is unremunerati^'e ; and
it is to be expected that madder-growing will soon be a thing of the past, thousands
of acres of land being at the same time liberated for the growth of those products

I might have referred to other subjects besides the coal-tar colours which have

resulted from scientific research ; but I know of no otlier of such interest and
magnitude. From the brief history I have given, we see that the origin of these

colouriug-matters is entirel}' the fruit of many researches made quite independently

by different chemists, who worked at them without any knowledge of their futm-e

importance                                                       and on looking at the researches which                                                                                                      have        thus     culminated in this

industry, it is interesting to notice that many, if not most of them, were conducted

for the purpose of elucidating some theoretical point.

These facts certainly ought to be a great encouragement to chemists, and stimu-

late them to greater activity. It woiUd be very pleasing to see more work ema-

nating from the chemical schools of the United Kingdom ; and I think no student

should consider his chemical curriculum finished until he has conducted an original

research. The knowledge obtained by a general course of instruction is of course

of very great value ; but a good deal of it is earned on by rule. In research, how-

ever, we have to depend upon the exercise of our judgment, and, in fact, of all our

faculties ; and a student having conducted even one, under the guidance of an

efficient director, will find that he has acquired an amount of experience and

knowledge which will be of the greatest value to him afterwards.

   It is hoped these remarks will encourage young chemists to patiently and

earnestly work at whatever subject they may undertake, knowing that their results,

although sometimes apparently only of small interest, may contain the germ of

something of gi-eat scientific or practical importance, or may, like a keystone in

an arch, complete some subject which before was fragmentary and useless.

       On a Safe and Rapid Evaporating-]}an. By P. H. T. Allan.

In the course of various chemical manufactui-es there is sometimes met the diffi-

culty of products and apparatus being injured or destroyed in the process of rapid

evaporation by the salts settling to the bottom of the pan, and there becoming a

solid mass. This pan is intended as an effort to overcome that difficulty.

Besides attempting to compass the evaporation of the leys or other fluids safe

from the danger of deposition upon the heating-surface, it also provides for the

rapid evaporation of the fluids, with confimwus action in the pan, and the readi/

removal of the solids when formed. To attain these several ends, the form to be de-

scribed has been found necessaiy. The pan may be made of boiler-plate, and .about

30 feet long, by 10 feet broad, and 9 feet high. The heating-surface is supplied by

two flues of a V-shape carried through the fluid from one end of the pan to the

Vother. Tlie acutest angle of the is downward, and within 2 feet of the bottom

of the pan. This form of heat-source whilst raising the temperature to boiling-

point and effectually keeping it there, offers no resting-place for descending particles

and consequently the salts on separating fall to the bottom of the pan and there

accumulate. Now the apparatus is so an-anged that the bottom slopes in one or

more directions ; the salts gather in the deepest parts, and suitable outlets that may

be closed at pleasure being provided in the sides, they gi-avitate outwards into

proper receptacles. Care must be taken that sufficient solids are left in to occupy

the outlets, and the passage of fluids thereby prevented.

The upper part of the X -shaped flue is covered in its whole length and breadth

by an air-chamber of iron fitted with pipes or other arrangement passing into the

liquid, whereby the air heated from the waste heat of the flue is forced into the

boiling liquid, and there materially increases the rapidity of the evaporation.

  For the purpose of utilizing any heat that may escape from the air-chamber a
small pan occupies its upper surface. On this subsidiary pan the liquid may be

boiled to nearly saltint^j-point.' and then allowed to flow into the salting-down pan,

Athe smaller one being replenished with weak liquor.  limited supply of air may

be introduced into the second pan, and evaporation proceeds very rapidly.

The liquor in the pans need never lose its level, because, as salts pass from below

and steam from above continuously, it is continuously replaced by liquor flowing in

the air-pipes may therefore be only two or three inches below the surface of the fluid.

The pressure thus being not great, an ordinary fan will be sufiicient to force the air

through for evaporation.

                  Note on Anthracene-testing. By Jas. T. Bkoavn.

   In the earlier days of anthracene manufacture, when it was obtained solely from
the last runnings of oil, and when the distillation was stopped comparatively early

for the double reason of saving the bottoms of the stills and producing a good
marketable pitch, the principal solid impurities were naphthalene, phenanthrene,

and paraffin. With samples of this description the method of testing by agitation,

after washing with petroleum spirit, with a limited quantity of bisulphide of carbon

gives approximate and practically useful results. When, however, the demand for
anthracene inci-eased, the tar-distillers found it more advantageous to carr}' on the
distillation as far as possible, only stopping just before the point at which coking
conmienced. This method of working gives an entirely difl'erent variety of crude
anthracene, viz. one in which the principal solid impurities have higher boiling-
points than anthracene. These bisulphide of carbon fails to remove that test

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

therefore, with these samples, ceases to give true indications of their commercial

value. To correct this the authrakinone test was introduced, and was, judging fi'om
the terms in which it was proposed, looked upon as applicable to all commercial
anthracenes. The appendix to the paper soon followed, and showed that experience
had not confirmed those anticipations ; and now the kinone produced requires to be
tested as to its purity, as the result is by no means deflnite. In applying the kinone
test to commercial samples various minor difficulties occur, one of which is that
damp samples of anthracene are apt to lose moisture during the time that is occu-
pied in reducing them to a sufficient degi-ee of fineness to Jillow the small quantity
of I gramme to be a correct sample of the bulk ; and another and more serious one
is the uncertainty caused by the occasional occurrence of accidental impurities in
the quantity weighed out. To remedy these defects and facilitate the testing, the

author proposes the following modification :

   W^eigh out 50 grammes of the crude anthracene, and measm'e out 250 cubic

centims. of petroleum spirit; triturate the anthracene in a mortar with a sufficient
quantity of the spirit to form a thin cream, and pour it on a weighed filter (taking

care at the same time to leave in the mortar any grit or sand which may be present)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

rinse on to the filter any anthracene which may be round the sides of the mortar,

and employ the remainder of the spirit in washing the filter and its contents.
Allow it to drain, then fold it carefully, press between bibulous paper, dry at about
(50°-80° C, and weigh. Crush to a fine powder the contents of the filter, and from

that quantity weigh out the gramme required for the kinone test; then proceed in
the usual manner. In calculating the result allowance must of course be made for

the diminution in weight caused by washing the crude sample with petroleum

spirit.

   The method proposed in the foregoing short note does not claim for itself theo-

retica accuracy, but it claims the following advantages : ^

    Ist. It affords a ready method of detecting and separating extraneous matter,
such as gi'it, sand, shreds of canvas, or splinters of wood, all of which are liable to
occur even in good anthracene.

   2nd. The preliminary washing produces a dry powder of perfect uniformity, from
which it is easy to weigh out a small quantity.

   3rd. The preliminary washing removes, beside others, the greater part of two
important impurities, one of which, viz. paraffin, defies the kinone test, and the

other, viz. phenauthrene, is not, if present in large quantities, completely oxidized

under a considerable time.

   4th. By removing a large proportion of the impurity beforehand the oxidation

proceeds more quietly, and the kinone obtained is more crj'stalline and freer from
chromium compounds.

pansion, to supplement the effect produced by simple pressure.

   It then describes the engineering arrangements finally adopted for dealing with

250,000 feet of gas daily at the works of Messrs. Young & Co., on the principle of

the drawing exhibited. The diagrams used were enlargements of the actual draw-
ings of the machine as erected, and showed all the precautions found necessary
in actual construction. The working of the machine, which gives, as a maximum,
2000 gallons per week, during the last thi'ee months was described, and samples

of the product exhibited burning in Laidlaw's air-gas apparatus.

          --On the Limited Oxidation of Terpenes. Part IV.*

                            By Charles T. Kingzett, F.C.S.

     In this part of his researches the author has more particularly inquired into
 the phenomena attendant upon the atmospheric oxidation of turpentine in the pre-

 sence of water.' These phenomena may be staled as:

      (ff) Increase of the specific gravity of the oil as the oxidation proceeds.

     (h) Gradual increase in the amount of peroxide of hydrogen produced, or the rate
 at which it forms.

      (c) Gradual heightening of the boiling-point of the oil as it oxidizes.
     The oxidation, which takes place slowly at first, proceeds very actively after-
 wards, and the oil thus under treatment is capable of inducing fresh turpentine,

 which may be added to undergo oxidation at the same rate from the moment of

  contact.

     The oxidized oil evolves large quantities of oxygen on heating to near 160° C,
  and this oxygen is doubtless derived from camphoric peroxide. To the same sub-

  stance the author assumes to be due the camphoric acid and peroxide of hydrogen
  found in the aqueous solution that results from its decomposition with water.

     There are contained also in the watery solution obtained when turpentine is
  atmospherically oxidized in the presence of water, acetic acid, camphor, &c. Thus

  a solution obtained in one experiment upon several gallons of tm-pentine contained
  323 grains of peroxide of hydrogen and 3G7 grains of camphoric and acetic acids.
  The amount of peroxide of hydrogen produced is simply limited by the amount of
  turpentine oxidized, and can be regulated at will.

      This aqueous solution the author has proved to possess most powerful characters
  as an antiseptic and disinfectant, and continued investigations have shown these
  characters to be possessed by the individual constituents of the solution, viz. cam-

Elioric acid, peroxide of hydrogen, &c. lu the last part of his research the author
  as resumed the thread of his researches previously published, and found that

menthene (C,o Hjg), whether derived from solid or liquid Japan camphor (by the
action of ZnCU), produces, on atmospheric oxidation, among other bodies peroxide

of hydrogen, acetic and formic acids, &c. Now Wright (Jouru. Chem. Soc. ser. 2,

vol. xiv. p. 2) has obtained from menthene, by the action of bromine, cymene ; and
so the conclusion stated in the author's previous papers that all hydrocarbons con-
taining cymene as a proximate nucleus give peroxide of hydrogen on oxidation is

confirmed.

   Wright has also failed to obtain cymene (0^ B.^^) from clove terpene (C^. H.J,
a result in accordance with the author's observ^ations previously made to the same

effect.

   The author has submitted the ethers also to atmospheric oxidation, and in this
way results have been obtained which are of the greatest interest and importance.

S4Ethylic ether n^  absorbs oxygen even in the cold, but more readily in sun-

shine, and gives rise in the presence of water to peroxide of hydrogen, which may

result from reactions represented by the following equations :

          g.^H=jo+0,=g^g3O[0+H,0,

(1)

(2) g:g:''[o+03=g^;g30}o,-fH,o,

(3) g^-g3j;[ 0,+2H,0 = C^g30| 0+C.H3OI o+H,0,;

or (3) may be written thus :

                   CH,GOOI ,HHOI CH3COOHI ,HOI

                 CH3C0 0f +HHOf -CH3C00Hf ^HOf

   That is to say, the ether may, in the first place, become acetic ether and eliminate

water ; secondly, the acetic e'ther may become anhydride, and the latter may be

finally converted into peroxide. This" peroxide, being unstable in the presence of
water, splits up into acetic acid and peroxide of hydrogen.

   These results are confirmed by the fact that Brodie discovered acetic peroxide
by acting on acetic anhydride with baric dioxide.

  " These equations are, moreover, exactly parallel with those indicated by the author
as representing the production of hydric peroxide from turpentine, and it is to their
substantiation that his eftbrts in the future will be directed. Meanwhile he claims
that they experimentally demonstrate clearly for the first time the existence of the
radical hydroxyl in combination ; and, in short, the production of peroxide of

hydrogen in the way described amounts to the isolation of hydroxyl in combination

with itself.

iany solid matter nor resin after standing for some months exposed to air ; neither

does its reaction alter. The oil rapidly absorbs oxygen from air. It is most ener-

getically acted upon by strong nitric acid, also by sulphuric acid, which appears to

polymerize some of the constituents of the oil. Hydrochloric acid gas produces one

or perhaps two liquids, but no solid chlorhydrates ; these are scarcely, if at all, de-

composed by prolonged ag itatation with warm water. The specilic gi-avity of sage-

--oil is 09339 at 14° C. After prolonged fractionation the oil splits up into four main

portions two liquids, almost certainly terpenes, boiling respectively at 157° and at

167" C. ;  a liquid,  probably containing  oxygen,  boiling at  198°-203°                                          and  a  solid
                                                                                                                ;

camphor melting at 187° C. The terpenes both appear to contain cymene, as by

treatment with sulphuric acid, the liquid being carefully kept cold, and distillation

in steam, cymene is obtained. These terpenes yield brominated compounds, which

split up, on distillation, intohydrobromic acid and cymene ; the brominated compound
from the lower boiling terpene is much more stable, however, than that from the

terpene of higher boiling-point. For the oxygenized liquid constituent of the oil

the name of salviol is proposed. The terpenes both yield terephthalic acid on oxida-

tion with weak chromic liquor.

                 On the action of Dilute Saline Solutions upon Lead *.
                          By M. M. Pattison Muie, F.R.S.E.

   After generalizing former results the author describes experiments carried out
under varying conditions, which seem to prove :

   (1) That increase of surface of lead exposed is generally associated with increase
of lead dissolved. This conclusion does not, however, invariably hold good ; the
nature of the salt in solution, the time of action, &c. influence the action.

   (2) That exposure of large siu-faces of liquid to the surrounding air very gene-
rally causes an increase in the quantity of lead dissolved, this increase being most
marked in the case of those salts (nitrates &c.) which enable water to exercise a
notable solvent action upon lead, and after the expiry of lengthened periods of

time.

    (3) That the solvent action of dilute saline solutions upon lead increases in an

ever-increasing ratio with increase of time of action (longest period tried = 505 hours),
except ia the case of potassium carbonate solutions, where a point of maximum

action appears to be reached after the expiry of about 340 hours.

    Note on some new Anthracene Compownds. By W. H. Peekin, F.R.S.

   A very dilute solution of anthracene in carbon disulpliide, when cooled to (P C.

and treated with bromine, yields an addition product, a " dibromide of anthracene,"'
 C,, H,(, Brj. It is a very unstable body, rapidly decomposing at the ordinary tem-
perature of the air, with evolution of hydro bromic acid ; when heated it also gives off
this acid, and is converted into monobromanthracene, C^^ H^ Br.

    If chlorine be ui=ed in place of bromine, a " dichloride of anthracene," C,, Hj^, Ol^,

is produced, which is even less stable than the corresponding dibromide ; when
heated it decomposes and yields monochloranthracene, C,^ Hg 01.

         On Picoline and its Derivatives*. By William Ramsay, Ph.D.

    The following salts of picoline were prepared :
    The hydrochloride, deliquescent, melting at 160° 0.
   The hydrobrottiide, melting at 187°. These two salts may be crystallized from

--impure picoline.
    The dibromide of picoline hydrohromide. Prepared by treating the hydrobromide
with bromine. It forms golden-yellow scales, and melts at 85°. It is sparingly

soluble in water.

  --The diiodide ofpicoline hydriodide. Formed when picoline hydriodide is distilled.

Reddish-brown crystals, which melt when brought in contact with water ; soluble
in alcohol and in ether. Melting-point 79°.

    The formula of Anderson's trichloropicoline hydrochloride is disputed, both from
the results of analysis, from its method of preparation, and from its properties. It
appears to be a hypochlorite, and to contain the group (0 CI). The white powder

Nto which Anderson ascribes the formula Cg II4 CI3 . IICl is a product of the action

 of water on an oil obtained by projecting picoline into chlorine gas.

   NPicoline dibromide, Cg H^ . Brg, formed by the action of a solution of bromine

in chloroform on picoline, and

   NPicoline iodochloride, Cg H, . CI I, prepared in a similar manner, are crystalline

--solids. The halogens, therefore, act on picoline to form at least four distinct sub-

stances : 1, a direct addition compound containing picoline plus two atoms of halo-
gen ; 2, a substitution compound which undergoes alteration when brought in con-
tact with water ; 3, a salt of the halogen acid ; and 4, an addition-product con-
tainmg two atoms of the halogen combined with the haloid salt.

    The ferrocyanide forms white crystals.
    The platinocyanide consists of i«f ?e pale yellow rhomboids. It crystallizes with

4H,0

   The taHrate forms long white needles.
   The citrate is uncrystallizable.
   The phosphate is a white deliquescent crystalline mass.
   The chlorate forms very thin diamond-shaped crystals.

    The following compounds with alcohol radicals were prepared :
    The methyl iodide, by mixing equivalent quantities of methyl iodide and pico-
line. Long white needles, which melt at 226°'5-li27°.
   The methyl chloride is an extremely deliquescent salt, and crystallizes from alcohol

in needles.

    The methyl nitrate forms large transparent prisms.
    The methyl hydrate, prepared by means of moist silver oxide, rapidly becomes
discoloured in the air, and when acted on, first with bromine, then with ammonia,

assumes a red colour. No methylaniine was evolved on boiling its aqueous solu-

tion.

feathery bluish-black crystals. It is prepared by dissohang iodine in an alcoholic

solution of the methyl iodide.

   The ethyl iodide is analogous to the methyl iodide ; and the ethyl hydrate gives
a similar reaction with bromine and ammonia.

   The ethene bromide forms small hard prisms, which melt at about 270°. The

etheue chloride crystallizes from alcohol in needles.

Picoline allyl compounds are all sirups, with exception of the platino-chloride.

The hydi-ate is more stable than the methyl, ethyl, or ethene h^ydrates, and after

evaporation at 100^ dissolves in alcohol with a brilliant purple colour, ^vhich may

be commimicated to silk.

As picoline is not decomposed by potash in any form, it cannot be a nifrile or a

carbouine. It is not altered by being passed through a red-hot tube filled with

lime or lead peroxide. Boiling sulphuric acid and nitric acid, or a mixtm-o of both,

have no action on picoline ; but when the nitrate is heated it undergoes complete

decomposition into carbonic acid and probably water.

Picoline probably  does   not   contain  a methyl  group                           for  on  oxidation it yields
                                                                                ;

Dewar's pyridene dicarbonic acid. This acid is not derived from lutidine, as was

supposed by Wright. Experiments to prepare the aldehyde and alcohol fi-om

dicarbo-pyridenic acid lead to a prospect of success ; and from the alcohol true

methyl pyridine may possibly be obtained.

     On the Manufacture of Iodine f. By Edward C. C. Stanford, F.CS.

   The author gives an interesting account of this manufacture, which in Great

Britain is confined to Glasgow and its neighbom-hood. He gives a resume of the

remarkable fluctuations in the price of iodine, and also of the changes in the uses
of kelp, or sea-weed ash, from its first manufacture about a hundi-ed years ago to

the present time. He traces its use from the beginning of the present century,
when it was the principal source of alkali, and when Scotland alone produced
20,000 tons annually, worth £20 to £22 per ton. During the following 22 years
the importation of barilla reduced the price of kelp to £10 per ton. Then the
removal of the duty on barilla, followed by that on salt, reduced it further to £3
per ton, and in 1831 to even £2 per ton. In 1845 the manufacture of iodine com-

menced, and kelp was again in demand. The imports and prices are shown in the

following table (p. 69).

   It was impossible to give the imports of kelp earlier than 1845, as this table was
obtained with difficulty from indirect sources, the Clyde trust having disposed of
their books previous to 1859, thus rendering the early history of this interesting

subject at present inaccessible for statistics.

   It is shown that a large number of makers of iodine in Glasgow at that time had
been now reduced to three,

   The working of kelp for iodine is minutely described, with the remark that all
the text-books on the subject describe only processes and apparatus abandoned by
manufacturers many years ago. The large production of iodine which may be
expected from the Chilian caliche is fully investigated and it is shown that the
possible production far exceeds the utmost output of Great Britain and France ; but
there are difficulties in the manufactm-e which have hitherto prevented very large
imports from this source.

   The quantities of iodine in several species of sea-weed, and from a large num-
ber of analyses of specimens from all parts of the coast, are tabulated. The author

shows that all sea-weeds contain iodine ; but few contain it in the quantity worth
working.

   These are the deep-sea algae exclusively.

   His own researches are alluded to (Society of Arts, Silver Medal, Feb. 14, 1862)
in reference to the great loss of iodine in the present wasteful method of burning
kelp ; and his suggested improvement of collecting the winter tangle, now generally
wasted, and distilling it in closed retorts, is described. The sea-weed is thus con-

verted into charcoal (which remains in the retorts), and ammoniacal liquor, and tar
condensed in suitable condensers, and gas, which is used to light the works.

   The gas liquor yields ammonia and acetic acid. From the charcoal, the salts of
potassium and sodium, with iodides and bromides, are easily washed out, and a

residual charcoal is obtained which resembles that from bones. This charcoal is
fully equal to animal charcoal as a decolorizer and deodorizer, and can be very

cheaply obtained.

   The manufacture affords winter employment to a large and indigent populatioa
in the winter, when they most need it. It has been earned out on a large scale in

some of the outward Hebrides, and has quadrupled the produce of iodine and

greatly benefited the people.

  Two series of experiments on the relative actions of salts, often added by manu-

facturers to their size, in aiding or retarding the development of mildew, showed
that the free acid present, together with dampness, is the most fruitfid cause of
mildew ; and if the acid be neutralized with soda ash, mildew develops with much
difficulty, and only after a very considerable lapse of time.

  When dilute bromine water is added to a solution of cotarnine hydrobromide

combination takes place, and a crystalline orange precipitate is thrown down con-

sisting principally of dihrom-hydrocotai-nine hydrohrumide ; if excess of bromine be
used, the precipitate chiefly consists of tribrom-hydrocotarnine hydrobromide, these
two brommated bodies being formed thus :

   If hydrocotaruine hydrobromide be used instead of cotarnine hydrobromide, and

formed, thus :

new base being left. After due purification the free base is obtained from 80 per

cent, alcohol in bright oranr/e crystals containing C,, HgBrNO,, yH^O, the water

of crystallization being lost at 100° and a brilliant crimson anhydrous base being

left. This crimson mass is a delicate test for the presence of moisture in nearly

absolute alcohol ; when crystallized from such containing only a minute trace of
moisture, oranr/e hydrated crystals are thrown down on cooling, whilst criinson

anhydrous crystals are formed when -very carefidly dehydrated alcohol is employed

it may be noted that long standing over and distillation from a large bulk of quicklime

does not sufficiently dehydrate ordinary 90 per cent, spirit to give crimson crystals

by this test.

    The salts of this base readily crystallize ; the hydrochloride and hydrobromide

are of a straw-yellow colour and sparingly soluble in cold water ; on adding sodium

carbonate to the warm only slightly yellow aqueous solution, bright orange crystals

of the free base separate rapidly on stirring.

    The results communicated to the Association last year, together with those

obtained by Duquesnel, seem to point to the inference that when a mineral acid is

used to acidify the alcohol used in the extraction of alkaloids from aconite roots,

alteration of the base or bases originally present takes place to a greater or less

extent, owing to the influence of the heat employed to evaporate the alcoholic

extract ; whereas if tartai-ic acid be used, and the extract be evaporated at as low a

temperature as possible, as in the experiments of Duquesnel, much less alteration

takes place and a considerable amount of abase crystallizable from ether is obtained.

  Two cwt. of Aconiimn napellus were worked up by this latter process for the

purpose of examining more closely the                                                                                                                 character of the crystals thus obtained                                                                                                                                                                               the

extract, evaporated gently to a small bulk, was treated with water and filtered from

precipitated resin ; the aqueous filtrate then yielded a semicrystalline precipitate

when treated with potassium carbonate in slight excess. This precipitate was

fractionally crystallized from ether and other solvents, and finally split up into a

large number effractions                                                                                                  no  evidence, however,      could be obtained of the presence

a small quantity of an obstinately adherent non-crystalline base of lower molecular

weight, gave identical numbers agreeing mth the formula C33 H^3 NOj,,, the gold

salt being indicated by C33 Hj,;, NOj^ HCl, AuClg.

    This crystallized base, to which it is proposed in future to restrict the term

aconitine, is eminently active physiologically, and agrees closely in all its properties
with the " crystallized aconitine " of Duquesnel obtained by the same process, the

different formula arrived at by Duquesnel (viz. Cj^H^o NO,,) being apparentl}'^

due either to impurity in the substance examined or to analytical imperfections.

    The base, crystallizable from ether, obtained in small quantities from A. napellus

by extraction with alcoholic hydrochloric acid, as described in the Brit. Assoc. Rep.

1875, p. 38, gave last year numbers from which the C33 II,, NO,,, or one closely

similar, was deduced : after further purification, however, this substance was found

to be perfectly identical with the aconitine above described, giving numbers repre-

sented by C33 H,,NO,,.

    In order to purify aconitine completely from another base which does not crystal-
lize from ether, but which obstinately adheres to aconitine when crystallized from
that and other menstrua, it is sufficient to dissolve the approximately pure snow-

white crystals already crystallized several times from ether in warm dilute hydro-

bromic acid ; on cooling and standing, well-defined crystals of the hydrobromide of
aconitine separate, the other base being completely retained in the mother liquors
the drained and washed crystals yield perfectly pure aconitine on dissolving in water,
precipitating by sodium carbonate, and crystallizing the precipitate from ether.
This non-crystalline base does not appear to form crystallizabie salts ; it has a
considerably lower molecular weight than aconitine. Whether it is originally
present in the roots, or is formed by alteration of the crystallizabie aconitine during
the extraction process, is not yet made out.

   These results, and those obtained last year, clearly point to the desirability of sub-
stituting for medicinal purposes the uniform homogeneous crystallized base (or a
salt thereof) for the more or less amorphous mixtures of aconitine and other sub-
stances and alteration products usually found in pharmacy, inasmuch as some at
least of these admixtures are considerably less physiologically potent than aconitine,
C33H43NO12.

   Further experiments on the constitution of aconitine and the amorphous base or

bases are in progress.

Address by Professor J. Young, M.D., F.G.S., President of the Section.

When the British Association met in Glasgow twenty-one years ago, Sir Roderick

Murchison presided over Section C, and was surrounded by a brilliant company,

whose names, now historical, were even then familiar for their accuracy of observa-

tion, for philosophic generalization, and for the eloquence with which'theii- science

--was clothed in words that charmed while they instructed Lyell, Hugh Miller,

Sedgwick, Jukes, Smith of Jordan Hill, Thomas Graham, Agassiz, Salter, Leonard

Horner, John Phillips, Robert Chambers, H. D. Rogers, Charles Maclaren, Sir W.

Logan : the list is a heavy one even for twenty-one years ; and the changed cir-

cumstances will be fully realized by Nicol, Harkness, Egerton, Darwin, Ramsay,

and others when they find Murchison's place occupied by one who holds it rather
by the courtesy of the Council to the Institution in which we are assembled than

by any claim he has to the honour.

It would be out of place for me to do more than refer to the Geological advantages

which have given to Glasgow its commercial greatness. In the Handbook prepared

at the instance of the Local Committee will be found gathered together all the

positive knowledge we possess regarding the mineralogy, stratigraphy, and palaeon-

tology of the west of Scotland. The specimens themselves are exhibited in the

Hunterian Museum     and in the Corporation Galleries                                                                                                                        and  I take it upon me to say
                                                                                                                                                                          ;

the Glasgow geologists are as ready as ever to assist the investigations of students

in special departments with all the material which richly fossiliferous strata yield

and the careful skill of assiduous collectors can secure.

   Thus relieved from entering into local details, 1 would ask your attention for a
short while to some of the difficulties which a teacher experiences in summarizing

the principles of Geology for his students.

I may be pardoned for reminding you that as yet there are in Scotland only two

specially endowed teachers of Geology. In the iCniversities, that science for which
Scotsmen had done so much received only the odd hours spared from Zoology. In

1867 the two courses were separated in Glasgow ; in 1870 Sir R. I. Murchison

founded  the  Chair  of  Geology in  Edinburgh                                              in  187C                                                                              ]\Ir.  Honyman  Gillespie
                                                                                         ;

endowed a Lectureship on Geology in Glasgow, not separating it from Zoology, but

rather desiring the two to remain associated, while means were provided for tutorial

instruction in the elementary work of the class. When next the Association meets
       TRANSACTIONS OF THD SECTIONS.                                                73

in Glasgow, I hope that the services which scieuce has rendered to mining; and

luetallurgy may have been recognized bv those who have reaped the benefit.

During the efforts of years to obtain provision for systematic teaching in Mining

and MetaUurgy, practical and scientiiic have always been set in opposition by those

whom I addressed. In another twenty years it mav have become apparent that it

is possible for a man to be both practical and scientific, and that the combination is

most conducive to economy.

Geology occupies the anomalous positiou of being a science without a special ter-

minology," a position largely the result of its liistory, but to some extent inherent in

its subject-matter. Treated of by liutton and Playfair and their opponents in the

ordinary language of conversation, current phrases were adopted into science, not so

much acquiring special meanings as adding new ambiguities to those already

existing. Everv one seemed to understand them at once ; and thus, as no one was

obliged to attach verj^ precise meanings to them, the instruments of research became

its impediments, and the phrases in common use at the beginning of the centm-y

have transmitted to the present day the erroneous ideas of those by whom they were
first employed. When Lj'ell, in 1832, methodized the knowledge accumulated

prior to that date, he had, in organizing the scieuce, to choose between inventing

an appropriate terminology and adopting that in common use. By doing the latter

lie promoted the popularity of the science, though at the cost of some subsequent
confusion ; by attempting the former he would have set in arms against him those

who would, according to the pedantry of the time, have denounced his neologisms and

foimd in them a decorous veil for the objections which they entertained on other
grounds to his views. Lj'ell was not the man to face the latter difficulty ; nor can

it be charged against him that he was wittingly neglectful of the interests of

science. But to the use of conversational language are traceable certain assump-

tions to which I desire to draw your attention. In venturing criticism of this kind

I am not unmindful of the Nemesis which has overtaken my colleague, Sir VV.

Thomson for his comments on Lyell's language. Thomson took exception to lan-

guage whicli implied a kind of perpetual motion, a circulation of energy- at variance

with the teaching of physics : and, behold, two or three years after, Lockyer has

published, as a physical astronomer, and Prestwich has approved, as a geologist, the

opinion that the temperature of the sun may have fluctuated, that, in fact, changes

of chemical combination may from time to time have refreshed the heat of the

planet, whose uniform rate of cooling Sir William had assumed.

When- sti'ati graphical geology first received due attention, the notion w.as pre-

valent that each formation terminated suddenly by cataclysm ; it was therefore

natural tliat the British succession, the earliest to be tabulated in detail, should be

taken as a standard for other countries, and that the emmieration of the series

should be a generalized section in which were incorporated those strata not pre-

sent in Britain. The " intercalation " of beds thus practised to make an " incom-

plete " series "complete," still survives, as do the terms, though the notions which
Aunderlie them are formally denied by those who use them.
                                                           patriotic fellow-

countrj'man once surprised us by his (·ehement denunciation of a treacherous Scot

who called the Lanarkshire Limestones meagre and incomplete as compared with

the English. With knowledge he might have made his criticism useful ; as it was,

he only gave a fresh example of the national peculiarity which, if it cannot prove

Scotland to be better ofi' than its neighbom's, is content if it can make it out to be no

worse. The abundant fossils of the Mesozoic strata of England and Prance ren-

ABCdered comparison easy, and created the impression that conchology was the

of geology, physical being subordinated to palajontological evidence. The balance

has been somewhat restored by the Geological Survey, the precision of whose

physical observations enables them to guide the palfeontologist as often as they
have to be guided by him. But one legacy from our predecessors we have not got
rid of; nor, indeed, has its value been much called in question.

The process of intercalation had at first to do only with observed gaps, into which

obvious equivalents could be received. But as the needs of speculative Biology

rapidly increased, in the same ratio did belief in the imperfection of the geological

record increase, till now we have that record described as a most fragmentary

volume, nay, as the remains of the last volume, whose predecessors are lost to us.

5*4 REPORT 1876.

   Sir W. Thomson did good service by calling in question, on physical grounds,

the indefinite extension backwards of geological time. The iirstfruits of his crusade
were the definitions of Uniformitariauism and Evolution which Prof. Huxley gave.
Henceforth no one will maintain the onesided notions regarding these two opposing
views of the earth's history which were adopted in ignorant misconception or dic-
tated by conceit and bigotry. But the service done was even greater; for while it
became clear that a knowledge of physics was indispensable to him who would
promulgate sound notions, it was further apparent that both biological and geolo-
gical evolution had a limit in time, that in fact, on the assumption of the primitive
incandescence of our globe, the date might be at least approximately fixed when
the mechanical processes now at work commenced and when the surface of the
earth became habitable. Nothing more has yet been done than to point out the
way ; for, though Prof. Guthi-ie Tait indicates a limit of from 15 to 10 millions of
years, that statement can only be regarded as in efiect, though not perhaps in in-

tention, a protest against the liberality and vagueness of Sir W. Thomson's allow-

ance, which gave geologists a range of from one to two hundi'ed millions of

years.

   The reconciliation of physicists and geologists is not likely to come through
Mr. Lockyer's researches, even if the earth's history be shown to have
been identical, unless the renewal of the earth's heat be shown to be compatible
with continued life on the surface. If the reconciliation is looked for through the

prolonged duration of the sun's life, that being the gauge of the earth's duration,
the expectation is still based on the supposed need of very great time for geological
processes, or rather on the supposed need of very great time for biological evolution,
to which geological evolution has been squared. There is another direction in

which these results may help us to meet the limitation assigned by the physicists :
the intervals of variation of temperature may be shorter than those which separate
the maxima of eccentricity of the earth's orbit; and thus the repeated cold periods
of which we have suggestions in the stratified rocks, may have recuiTcd within a

sliorter total period than is at present claimed.
   It is scarcely within the compass of this address to enter into the questiDus in-

volved ; but it is permissible to indicate the reason for delaying meanwhile accep-

tance of any precise limit of time. There is as yet too much diversity of opinion

as to the elements of the problem. Physicists are by no means at one as to the
conditions which permit or prohibit shifting of the earth's axis. Oalcidations are
based on the assumption of the regularity of the earth's form, under a certain con-
.<stant relation of the masses, albeit of diverse specific gravity, which compose it.
It is moreover assumed that the ratio of land and water have been uniform, though
the formation of the grand features of the land by contraction of the cooling mass
has not yet been considered as affecting this assumption by altering the disposition

of the water. On the one hand it has been shown that the existence of uniform

temperatures over the earth's surface is a gratuitous hypothesis ; on the other
hand it is clear that the existing distribution of light and heat is incompatible with
the flourishing of an abundant Carboniferous and Miocene flora within a short
distance of the north pole. One expects tliat astronomers will look to the shifting
of the axis of rotation as the possible explanation of the difficulty, taking into
account likewise the shifting of the centre of gravity necessarily following those
displacements of matter which, on the contraction theory, liave determined the
positions of the main continents and oceans.

   Mr, Evans, in his address to the Geological Societ}', refeiTcd to the deviation of
the magnetic axis as perhaps due to such shifting of the materials composing the

inner mass of our globe. May not the conjectures of M. Elie de Beaumont be
after all in the right direction ? May not the change of trend which led him to

classify the mountain-chains by reference to the age at which they had been ele-
vated, be associated with movements which did not in all cases result in shiftings
of the earth's axis so pronounced as those which permitted the Carboniferous and
Miocene floras to invade successfully the arctic regions, or the phenomena of the
glacial epoch, or epochs, to manifest themselves in the low latitudes where their
traces have been recognized ?

   AVaiving, for the present, inquiry into the influence which the admission of a
               TRANSACTIONS Ol'' THK SECTIONS.  73

fossible shifting of the earth's axis might have on our estimate of geological time,
  shall return to the phraseology whose amendment seems advisable.

The confusion which exists is well illustrated in a remark by an eminent Avriter

to the effect that the progress of geological research tends to prove the " continuity

of geological time." The phrase in itself involves an absurdity ; but what is meant
is, that the successive so-called formations pass into each other by imperceptible
gradation, and that, as time goes on, we shall be more and more able to intercalate

strata so as to present a continuous scale of animal and vegetable forms. This is

one out of many samples of the extreme length to which the thirst for strict

Wecori'elation may go.  find in Murcliison's writings and elsewhere pointed pro^

tests against the succession of strata in one district being held to rule that in other

districts ; but these are rather concessions wrung from their author by the pressure
of particular instances than acknowledgments of a rule applicable to contiguous

and to distinct localities alike. I could not perhaps take a better example than the

strata which contain the remains of the fossil Equidcc. If we arrange the fossils in

any series representing the modification of particular structures, or averaging the

modifications of all the structures, we shall find that the terms of the series are met

with, now in Europe, now in America yet no one would venture to intercalate
                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

the European in the American Tertiary series so as to square the geological record

with an assumed zoological standard. The notion of gi-adations, the extreme view

of correlations, has led to results which are, to put it mildly, of doubtful value.

Yet it was a natural result of the work of Cuvier and other palaeontologists among

the Mesozoic and Eocene fossiliferous deposits. The statistical method invented

by Lyell is simply a mode of gradations. Intercalation of strata is therefore a

siu'vival from an earlier stage of the science, and can-ies with it a distinct echo of

the catastrophic notion that strata were formed simultaneously and generally over

the earth's surface, if not universally.

The geological record has been compared to a volume of which pages have

here and there disappeared ; and the incompleteness of the record has been in-

ferred from the frequency of pronounced gaps in the succession of strata. Of these

gaps, these unconformities. Prof. Ramsay has shown the importance by demon-

strating that they represent the lapse of unknown, but varj'ing, and in all cases

considerable periods of time. The intercalation of strata, assumed to fill up the

gap, and hereby to give symmetry to systematic classifications, can only be done by

an appeal to the statistical method, a fauna containing forms characteristic of higher

and lower beds being assumed to represent an intermediate point in time, whereas

it might be equally well claimed as representing an intermediate area in space, and

as being possibly representative of the whole gap and of some of the strata above

and below it.

The definition of a formation as representing a certain period of time, still re-

peated with various modifications, is to blame for this and several other cm-iosities

of procedure. But the climax of symmetrical adjustments is reached when we find

--" natural groups " established when, in other words, an attempt is made to show a

regular periodicity of plienomena in Geology. Dawson proposed a quaternary,

--Hull a ternary classification to neither of which should I now refer, but that tlie

deserved estimation of these writers is apt to perpetuate what seems to be an unsafe

view of geological succession.

Hull's arrangement has the merit, by force of its simplicity, of bringing the

A'ainness of the attempt into prominence. Dawson has complicated his classification

Aso as to render it impracticable.  natural group of strata, one in which elevation,

deep depression, elevation, record themselves in rocks so as to establish geological

cycles, implies several things for which we have no evidence. Most important of

all, it implies that the events above noted should recur in every area in the same

order, that they should recur at equal intervals of time, and therefore yield equal

masses of strata, and, above all, that the superior and inferior limits of each natiu'al

and conterminous group should consist of a mass of similar strata, one portion of

which shall belong to the earlier, the other to the later group. Here then we have

implied, not catastrophic simplicity as regards the strata, but something very like

it as regards the subterranean forces.

Mr. Hull has not, however, been able to surrender himself wholly to his specula-
                                                                                                 8*

--tion. He has admitted " Gaps" breaks, that is to say, for which he finds no equi-
--valents in the British series the strata that should occupy these gaps having been

either removed by denudation or never deposited, the British area being at these

times above water. The concession is fatal to the scheme. But the very use of

the word gap recalls the phrases " complete " and " incomplete," and their nearest of
kin, " base of a formation." Prof Ramsay used the word '"'break" to mark his
unconformities ; but no term has been proposed for " the base of a formation." The
term was in constant use when such base was always claimed to be a conglo-

merate. That notion is now exploded ; but no distinction is drawn between the

lowest bed of a group of conformable strata, and the bed or beds which repose

unconformably on those below them. Thus the London Basin has the Thanet beds,

the Reading beds, and the London Clay successively resting on the Chalk and each
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

of these is the base for its proper locality, unless it be asserted that in this and

similar cases the lowest beds once covered a wider area and were then removed.

But a more important case is presented by the great calcareous accumulations of

the Carboniferous and Chalk series. The Lower Greensand is to the latter series in
England what the lowest stratum of the chalk would be if we could get at it. The

C'arboniferous Limestone rests directly on the Red Sandstone iu Central England

further north it rests on the Calciferons Sandstones. Thus the base of the forma-

tion varies according to locality, or rather according to the circumstances of depo-

sition; and we need a term which would indicate a difference between the conform-

able and unconformable succession. JNIr. Judd has lamented the equivocal use, by

English writers, of the term formation, which etyniologically is as well applied to the

Chalk without flints as to the whole Cretaceous series. Pie advocates " system " as

--applicable to the larger groups the Cretaceous system fn* example. But it seems

as if the time were come for still further restrictions of either or both terms.

The analogy of the geological record to an incomplete volume is, like most

analogies, at once imperfect and misleading. Rather might the record be compared

to the fragments of two volumes which have come to be bound together, so that it

is not possible to recognize the sequence. Or perhaps it might be better compared

to a universal history in which, by omission of dates, the chronology is thoroughly

obscured, and the necessary treatment of each nation by itself conceals the con-

temporaneity of events. V\^e have the aquatic record and the terrestrial record : and

these two are going on simultaneously. It is as yet, and probably always will be

injpossible to recognize the marine deposits which correspond to the terrestrial

Weremains, save perhaps in the most recent geological times.  now know that

the life of the Cretaceous seas is not wholly extinct in the existing Atlantic Ocean,

but exists there to an extent which would entitle the deposits of that area to rauk

by the statistical method as intermediate between the Cretaceous and the Tertiary.

It is obviously impossible to include under one term deposits which are associated

with geographical changes so important as those commonly accepted as having

prevailed during the Tertiary epoch. The iNIesozoic forms pass gradually into the
Tertiary; how gradually we cannot say, since the deep-sea equivalents of the

European Tertiaries are not certainly known to us. But as a jiortiou survives to

the present day, and as, presumably, the extinction was not rapid (for it is only iu

the case of land-animals that sudden disappearances are as yet probable), it is obvious

that the successor, the heir, of the Chalk was not the Eocene, nor necessarily the

Miocene known to us, but probably deposits still buried under the Atlantic.

   ]\Iy object is to show that even the limitation of time which Prof Tait pre-
scribes for us may not after all be too narrow for the processes which have resulted

in our known stratigraphy. Mr. Darwin speaks of the geologic record being the

imperfect record of the last series of changes, the indefinite extension of time anterior

to the earliest fossiliferous rocks being necessary for the full evolution of organic

forms. But is there any ground for the assumption ? True that the Laureiitians

contain fragments of antecedent rock; but were these fossiliferous ? Are they the

remains of land surfeces on which living beings flourished ? or are they only the

debris of the first consolidated portion of the Earth's crust, on which if organisms

existed they may have been the most primitive of our organic series ? Mr.

Jukes refers to the possibility of sucli earlier strata having existed ; but he wrote

when geologists were dominated by the belief iu the indefiniteness of geological
                                                                                                        TRANSxVCTlONS OF THE SECTIONS.                         77

time. Now we are brought by pbj'sicists like Sir W. Thomson and Captain Datt'in

to face the question, Is there evidence of such earlier masses of stratitied de-

posits ? If we allow to the physical argument all the weight to which its advo-

cates deem it entitled, if we accept 15 millions of years, nay, even if we admit

100 millions of years as our limit, it follows that we may still regard the earth as

in its first stage of cooling. But when we turn to the geological evidence, all that

can be advanced is that the Laurentian strata contain fragments presumably derived

from earlier strata                                                                                     but metamorphosed fragments  among  metamorphic rocks  are
                                                                                                     ;

not the most reliable guides, and there is the positive evidence that the Laurentian

area has not been covered to any extent, if at all, by later deposits. So far as

direct proof goes, therefore, we have none that the earliest known stratified rocks

are not also the earliest deposited after cooling. Even if we disregard the limits

imposed by the philosophers, liberal though they ai'e in Sir W. Thomson's hands,

the absence of proof that later deposits covered Lam-entian areas seems entitled

to greater weight than is usually allowed to negative evidence. At best the asser-

tion of antecedent strata is an arbitrary one, which any of us is at liberty to con-

tradict, and in favour of which no pliysical evidence, and only zoological prejudices

can be adduced. The earliest stratified deposits known are the Laurentian ; and
they are, so far as we know, the earliest to have been deposited.

But apart from these possible though improbable earlier deposits, geological

time is said to be lengthened by the missing strata of later periods. Mr. Croll has

given great prominence to this, which is another of the things taken for granted in

geology. Commenting on Mr. Huxley's remark that if deposit went on at the

rate of 1 foot for 1000 years, the 100,000 feet of strata assumed by him to form the

earth's crust would be laid down in the 100 millions of years which Sir W. Thom-

son had given as the limit, "But," sajs Mr. Croll, "what of the missing strata?" It

is commonly said that we have only a part of the deposits of any period, that the

last have been denuded awaj', and that thus the time needed for their deposit and

for their subsequent removal are out of our knowledge. This is based on what we

see on the shore when the tide rises and falls and washes oft' at each turn a part of
the sand and mud laid down in the intei'val. But the older deposits were laid

down in deeper water than that between tide-marks, and were for the most part
laid down during subsidence. Even admitting removal of part of the strata to

have taken place dm-ing re-emergence, the quantity so withdrawu cannot be proved

to represent more than a small fraction of the total. To provide the needed elon-

gation of geological time by an appeal to arbitrary speculations is not admissible.

Belief on belief is, as Butler says, bad heraldrj-. The denudation to which im-

portance is justly ascribed is that represented by an unconformity. Re-elevation

lias been accompanied by disturbance of the area from a dift'erent centre than that

around which subsidence took place. The strata are worn obliquely; and thus

thickness of the mass at one place is greatly diminished, though it does not follow

--in all cases that the maximum thickness of the strata has been affected.
   The importance as I deem it, the excessive importance which is attached to the

missing strata is asserted by biologists, who apparently unconsciously seek to gain,

by prolonging the interval between successive groups, the time which ought rather

to be sought for in tracing, were that possible, the migrations of the species which

seem to have suddenly died out. In otlier words, there is a reversion to the older

ideas regarding the succession of strata which are embodied in such phrases as
the Age of Fishes, the Age of Eeptiles, and the like.

   But the inequality of surface which unconformitj' involves, entails that other

consequence, that the maximum thicknesses of the two masses of deposits do not

coincide in position. Hence the thickness of the strata in the area will be exag-

gerated, the time spent in deposit also exaggerated, if the two thicknesses f re put

together. This has been done by Mr. Darwin in drawing inferences from the mea-

surements given him by Prof. Ranisaj', measurejuents which, on the face of them,

do not represent a continuous pile of rock. Mr. Darwin nssunies either that ihe

--Welsh hills ("not to speak of the Hebrides) were covered by all the later strata

now demuled or that if we sunk a bore, say on the erst coast, we should go

through the whole series as tabulated. "\Mieu Prof. Huxley took 100,000 feet as

named it.
   The Geological Survey has corrected its tables in one important direction : it

lias shown the contemporaneity of imlike groups in different parts of Britain, the
distinct types of the Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous, Permian, and Purbecks
being placed in parallel columns. To some extent this is a curtailment of the
thickness of the rock series, the dissimilar strata are not piled on each other. But
the curtailment might be carried still further. The marine and terrestrial con-

ditions are simultaneous : if we could identify the dry land for each deep sea, we

should have possibly the overlap of periods producing extraordinary combinations,
though not perhaps Mesozoic and PaliBozoic faunas contemporaneous. But the

British series may be tabulated as follows :

In the case of the Cretaceous series, Mr. Ramsaj' has given illustration of the

ingenious views of De La Beche regarding the contemporaneity of deposits super-

posed one on the other. The Lower Greensand is contemporaneous with part of

the Chalk ; so -were parts of the Wealden : nay, even of the Purbecks a portion

must have been forming while the Cretaceous sea was gradually deepening

southward and eastward.

   It may be said that the recognition of the parallelism would not make very much

--difference after all that it would not one whit lessen the time spent in forming 500

feet of rock to know that there was elsewhere another .500 feet formed at the same

time. But the shortening of the geological list by striking out the overlaps of the

formations, and thus counting them only once, is of itself a matter of some conse-

quence, since, the maximum thickness of the Cretaceous being nearly 3000 feet and

that of the Weald 1.500 feet, even the partial coincidence in time of these masses

would, on Mr. CroU's calculation of 1 foot of deposit per thousand years, make

a considerable difference in tlie chronology, still more if the Carboniferous Lime-

stone be set against its probable contemporaries the Upper Old Red Sandstone and

Coal-Measures. Mr. Jukes's bold erasure of the Devonians was of itself a veiy im-

portant change in the chronological table and I doubt not others may yet be
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

achieved. But, it may be said, the Cretaceous still rests on the Wealden ; the ver-

tical thickness still remains. But is the ordinary method of estimating the thick-

ness quite reliable ? In some cases, as in the productive Coal-Measures, there is

tolerable uniformity ; but among the lower Coals and the Mesozoic strata, where the

strata or groups of strata are not regular, the maximum thicknesses of all are, as has

been  already  shown,  apt to   be  taken                               and  thus an  aggregate  more  or  less  in  excess
                                                                     ;

of the real thickness results.

But, recumng to an objection already referred to, arrange it as you like, you get,

say in Wales, a known thickness of 50,000 feet. But the rocks there are tilted; and

the absolute depth which they attain in this position isunkno^vn. In North Ame-

rica the Laurentians are estimated at 30,000 feet ; but though there is eveiy reason to

believe that they have not been covered to any extent with later deposits, the total

thickness of the sedimentary crust is, for the same reason as in Wales, imknown.

Bigsby has shown how varied are the surfaces on which the later deposits are laid

down ; how gxeat therefore must be the deductions from the sum total of maxi-

mum or even, average thickness of all formations before we approximate to the

actual thickness of sedimentary deposits at any one point. But take the actual
                                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                79

tliiclmess in Wales as given in Jukes's Manual from the Survey data : for the Cam-
hrians we have from 2^000-28000 feet ; Silurians, Upper and Lower, not counting

breaks by unconformities, 20000. If denudation takes place at the rate of 1 foot

in 6000 years, and deposit at the same rate, we should have for the Silurians alone

120 millions of years needed. If, however, deposit takes place at the rate of 1 foot

in 14,400 years, 288 millions of years would be needed for the accumulation of the

surviving strata. It is obvious that the rate of deposit or denudation or both are

misunderstood. The stratified rocks equal in amount the material denuded ; if we
knew the total amount of denudation we should know, not merel)' the residuum

--of rock open to our inspection, but the total amount of stratified deposits which had

been formed or at least approximately ; for the deposit of materials removed is not

synchronous with their removal. Obviously these elements are not known, and

cannot be known, to us. Mr. Croll, who has investigated the question theoretically,

assumes that deposit and denudation take place in equal times, and assumes further

a uniform distribution over the whole or over a part of the sea-bottom. But Prof.

Geikie's table shows that, if we are to take averages as a safe guide, the land

is lowered at the rate of 2 feet in 6000 yeai*s. Moreover, if, as Mr. Croll points

out, deposit was less during the Glacial epoch, the process must have been more

rapid since ; and thus an iiTegularity is introduced which impairs the value of the

calculations. Prof. Hughes, in the brief abstract of his Royal-Institution address

which alone I have had the opportunity of seeing, contests the validity of any esti-

mates of time on the basis of our existing knowledge. 1 do not mean to enter into

this question ; but I may be allowed to remark that any conclusions founded on mean

thickness of sedimentary formations are of no value. It is not the time necessary

for the building-up of a mean thickness, but that necessary for the formation of the
maximum thickness in particular regions, which we have to consider.

If the Laureutian rocks and their equivalents are to be regarded as the earliest

stratified deposits, or, rather, if there is no reason for believing that they were pre-

ceded by other stratified rocks, the relation of Huxley's homotaxis to any classifi-

cation of strata having the Laurentians as a fixed point is worth investigating.

The universal dift'usion of species in the earlier strata was first the accepted creed

of geologists. Then it was denied, though the language of the earlier faith con-
tinued cm-rent. Again we return towards the doctrine of extensive simultaneous

diffusion, but under a very much modified form. The 'Challenger' reports bear

testimony to the wide distiibution of forms in the deepest oceans ; and when we

turn from these and compare the lists of fossil species so found widely distributed,

it appears that here again we have oceanic foims, or at any rate those found in such

limestones as are safely assigned to a deep-water origin. Ramsay has shown that

the continental epochs in Western Europe overlasted considerable periods of time.

The antiquity of the Atlantic and Pacific is certain ; even their primitive character

is possible. Thus there are two conditions, land and deep-sea, reasoning regarding

which must be quite difi'erent from that applicable to the intermediate conditions.

It is exactly these intermediate states which present practical and speculative

difficulty. Theories which account for mountains and oceans fail to explain the
" oscillations " which were wont to be appealed to when terrestrial and marine sur-

faces succeeded each other. But the assumed movement of the land is by no means

a certainty ; and, as in the kindred case of faults, we need terms which shall be neu-

tral, whether the land has moved upwards or the sea shiunk downwards. The

terms Palajozoic, Mesozoic, and Cainozoic have long held their places from the re-

luctance to disturb established nomenclature, as well as from the difficulty of in-

venting appropriate substitutes ; but if retained at all, we know now that the rela-

tions they represent are not the same for the terrestrial, the deep oceanic, and the

intermediate areas, any more than the life is the same under those three conditions.

I have once before called attention to a grave difficulty in the physical geography

of Scotland                                                        and as Mr. Seeley has since then raised the  same question without ob-
                                                                ;

taining an answer, I would again state the case, as one which seems to involve the

revisal of some definitions.

   The Silurian hills of South Scotland are commonly said to have been covered by

--Old Red Sandstone and even by Carboniferous strata patches of these rocks being

met with on the south side of the fault which defines these hills, with their abrupt,
                                                                                                                 ;

coast-like margin seen from Edinburgh or from Symington station on the Caledo-

nian line. But the surface of these Silurians was denuded before the Old Red

times, as Mr. Geikie has showed. Nay, valleys existed as now, and in the same

positions as now. At the present time the rivers flow in identically the same

valleys, in at least the cases of theNith, the Annan, the Lauder, and the Liddell;

and the boundaries of the areas are so well known that we can safely assert no

buried channel to exist such as we find on the tributaries of the Clyde. That the

channels were occluded iu glacial times we may take for certain ; that the obstruc-

tion has been washed away and the courses cleared is equally certain. The surface-

contours were not materially altered : so that the retreating ice left hollows in the

position of the old valleys. " But the case is quite ditterent when we deal with the

older rocks. Their succession is marked by unconformities and overlaps, which it

is impossible to picture as associated with full preservation of the surface-features

on which they were laid down ; and when the thickness comes to be as much as

1000 feet or more, and of that thickness a part at least made up of marine strata,

the relapse of all the streams to their old courses is an event of the highest impro-

bability. Mr. Topley has pointed out how the dip of strMa may under certain cir-

cumstances coincide with their thinning out to the margins of their area of deposit,

changes of angle in highly inclined strata pointing in the same direction. The

ordinary rule, of protracting strata and thus restoring their thickness over the adja-

cent high ground, is (iu the case at least of South Scotland) a method which imposes

on atmospheric denudation, even if aided by the sea, a most complicated task.

Had time permitted, it might have been interesting to note the changing phrase-

ology regarding faults, and the pertinacity with which phrases involving the most

unsatisfactory and improbable causation continues to be used. L peast and down-

--cast, upthrow and downthrow, displacement upwards or downwards these it may

be said are of small importance ; they are only symbols. But, in the first place,

they are mischievous so far as they give students confused ideas with which to

contend ; and, in the second place, the continued acceptance of loose phraseology is

peculiar to geology. Even in metaphysics, where the subject-matter is much more

conveniently discussed in ordinary language, new terms are employed to a great

extent. But, important as I therefore regard these terms from the teacher's point

of view, the greater importance attaches to the accuracy of the notions which

imderlie our language regarding the processes and rates of deposit and denudation.

So far as our present knowledge goes, we must accept it as certain that there is

some limit to the duration of the earth in the past. Neither philosophers nor as-

dered all the possible changes in the position of the earth's axis, and in the rate at

which the earth loses heat. The limits hitherto prescribed are so discrepant that

we cannot as yet accept any as fixed. Neither have geologists so accurate a know-

ledge of geological processes that they can speak with confidence either of the ab-

solute or relative rates at which rock-formation has advanced. The geologist has

hitherto asked for more time, not because he himself was awai-e of his need, but

from a generous regard for the difficulties in which his zoological brother found

himself when lie attempted to explain the diversity of the animal series as the

result of slowly operating causes. The geologist aslied for more time simply

because he could form no just estimate of what was needed for the physical processes

with whose results he was familiar. But palseontological domination is now at an

end ; and the increasing number of geologists who are also competent physicists

and matJiematicians seems to mark a new school, which will strive to interpret

more precisely the accumulated facts. Such at least seems the history of the past

fifteen or twenty years. Such seems the direction in which speculation now tends ;

and in the foregoing remarks I have endeavoured faithfully to represent the drift

of our science. To many here present much of what I have said is already familiar

I therefore give place to the more legitimate business of the Section, looking to

receive elsewhere " such censures as may be my lot."

On the Physical Structure of the Highlands in connexion with their Geological
    History. By His Grace The Duke of Argyll, K.T., F.R.S., F.G.S*

The questions dealt with by Geological Science have now become so vast and

various, that no one district of country can be expected to furnish illusti-ations of

more than a very few of them.

   The West of Scotland, in the capital of which we are now assembled, is not rich

in deposits which illustrate the passage of animal life from the types that have
become extinct to those which are of more modern origin and which still survive.

No bone-caverns of importance have been discovered, and, with one exception,

even our river-gravels and estuarine deposits have not been especially productive.
That exception is, indeed, a great one. It was in this valley of the Clyde that the

late Mr. Smith, of Jordan Hill, first discovered those indications of an Arctic climate

recently prevailing which have ever since constituted a large and important branch

of geological inquiry, and the full interpretation of which still presents some of the

most curious and difficult problems with which we have to deal. But our Palaeozoic

areas, except the Coal Measures, are to a large extent singularly unfossiliferous.

Neither the Scottish Oolite nor Lias has yielded any remarkable additions to the

curious fauna of which in England and elsewhere they have yielded abundant

specimens.

   But, on the other hand, perhaps no area of country of equal extent in any quarter

of the world presents more remarkable phenomena than the West of Scotland, in

connexion with those causes of geological change which have determined the

form of the earth's surface, and have given to its physical geography those features

of variety and beauty which are the increasing delight of civilized and instructed

Wemen.      cannot descend the com'se of this river Clyde to the noble estuary in

which it ends without having presented to us mountain outlines and an intiicate

distribution of sea and land which raise questions of the highest interest and of
the greatest difficulty. From the northern shores of that estuary to Cape Wrath,

in Sutherland, the country is occupied mainly by rocks of Silurian age, but so

highly crystalline as to be almost wholly destitute of fossils, and so upheaved,

twisted, contorted, and folded into a thousand different positions, that, except in
one great section, it is most difficult to trace any persistent succession of beds. It

is one great series of billowy undulations traversed by glens and valleys, some of

which are high above tlie level of the sea, but many of which are now so deeply
submerged that through them the ocean is admitted far into the bosom of the
hills. These glens and valleys lie in many different directions ; but there are so many

with one prevalent direction as to give a general character to the map, a direction
from N.E. to S.W., or parallel to the prevalent strike of the Silurian rocks. The

--shapes of the hills and mountains are not by any means wholly without relation to

geological structure because in a thousand cases the sloping outlines will be found

to be determined by the inclination of the beds, and the precipitous or steeper out-
lines to be determined by the upturned or broken edges. In like manner there are
cases where a crumpled or knotted outline is the index of beds deeply folded and
contorted along anticlinal axes. But nevertheless there are also innumerable cases
wherp no such relation can be traced ; where the mountains seem to have been cut
out of some solid mass, all the rest of which has been removed by some agency

which left these grea,t fragments standing by themselves, and of which the con-
tours cut across the lines of structure at every variety of angle. Along the whole

western face of this country it is guarded from the open ocean by an archipelago
of islands, some of which are separated from the mamland by submerged valleys
no broader than those which separate one hill from another in the inland glens.

Many of these islands are wholly occupied by the debris and the outbursts of extinct
volcanoes. The mountains which are thus composed bear, in many cases, the
characteristic forms of lava-streams ; but many others are not readily distinguish-

able in outline from the mountains of wholly different material which are near
them. They reach the same general average level of height, here and there

rising into peaks very similar to others of a widely different age and of a widely

different material. Moreover all the islands partake largely of the general character
of the m.ainland in having their deeper valleys submerged, and in being thu^
deepl}' indented by arms of the sea similar to those which give their peculiar out-

line to the adjacent coasts.

   It may serve to bring more vividly before j'ou the facts of the physical geogTaphy

of this country (for which it is one of the duties of geologists to account if they
can) if I give you some statistical facts affecting the single county of Argyll,
which beg-ins on the northern shore of the Firth of Clyde. Follo^wing the coast-
line of that county from the head of Loch Long, which is its southern and
eastern boundary, to Loch Aylort, which is its northern and western boundary, and

including its islands, we find it measures no less than 2289 miles in length, of

which aoout 840 represent the sinuosities of the mainland, and 1449 represent

the coast-line of its larger islands. There are, besides, valleys which are now

inland, and are occupied by freshwater lakes which evidently, at a recent period,

were arms of the sea ; and these represent a further line of coast, measuring 27G
miles. There are 11 principal arms of the sea, each of them measuring from one

to six and thirty miles in length. Two of the.se arms of the sea exceed the 100-
--fathom line in depth
                        Jjoch  Fyno  and  the  Linnhe  Loch                        and it  is very  remarkable
                                                                                ;

tliat these deep soundings do not occur near the points where these lochs join the

more open sea, but, on Ihe contrary, far up their course orbed among the mountains.

The ridges dividing these and other vallej's vary in elevation from hills of Acry
moderate height to the range of Cruachan, which immcdiatelj' beyond the boundary
of the county culminates in Ben Nevis, which rears its head almost on a level
with Ben MaclJliui, now ascertained to be the highest summit in the British
Isles. But no statistics can give an idea of the intricacj' with which sea and land
are interfolded on our western coasts comparable with that which is gained by some
of the many beautiful vievrs which abound on the heights in the vicinitj- of Oban,
whence the visitor can command the entrance of Loch Etive, with the course for
many miles of the Linnhe Loch, of the Sound of Mull, the Sound of Kerrera, and

--the Firth of Lome.

  Now the question naturally arises to what geological ages and to what

geological causes do we owe, in its main features, this curious distribution of land

and sea ? I say in its main features, because, of course, the more superficial

sculpturing of every moimtainous country is undergoing incessant modification;

and this modification may have been, and probably has been, very considerable

indeed within times which, geologically speaking, belong to the existing age. But
the question I put has reference to the epoch of past time, when the main outlines
of hill and valley were determined ; when the great mass of the country (which has
been, I believe correct]}-, identified as composed of metamorphosed Silurian beds)
was elevated into the various moimtain- chains which now constitute its charac-

teristic features.

   If the question had been asked some five and twenty years ago, I should have

said that the evidence pointed to an age of great geological antiquity for the

central group of Highland mountains, in some shape very like that in which we
see them. All round the edges of the country tliere are the remains of the Old Red

Sandstone, which often fit into the contour of the valleys and have left fragments
in nooks and recesses of the hills. It would almost seem as if thej' had been the
·shores of the seas or great lakes in which that great system of deposits was laid

down, and that they lifted their heads above those waters in forms not whoUj''

unlike those in which we now see them. The total absence over almost the whole
country of any other or later rocks, the absence among the debris of any material

other than that of which the hills are themselves composed, would seem to confirm

tlie same general conclusion.

   Some doubt, however, may seem to have been thrown on this conclusion, since

it has become certain that it cannot be true of at least one district of our western
moimtains, which is ne-\'ertheless closely related to all the rest, having the same
general elevation, partaking of the same general bend of coast-lines, cut up by
.similar valleys, and fitting into the same contom-s of denudation. The district to
which I refer is that of the volcanic islands which stretch from the south end of

Mull to the north end of Skye. Since the discovery, which I v>-as fortunate enough

 to make in 1851 , of the leaf-beds of Ardtiui, it has become clearly ascertained that

--these islr.mls are the remains of volcanoes of that geological age to which an ever-

 increasing interest seems to attach that middle age of the great Tertiary division

of geological time to which Lj-ell g.ave the name of Miocene. The mountains of
 Mull, and of Eigg, and of Rona, and of Skj'e, with all their valleys and intricate

--lines of coast, have unquestionably an origin later than the Miocene how much

later, is the question of j)liysical geography which geologists are called upon to solve.
    It is possible, indeed, to suppose that the hills of the mainland might be of a very

different age from those of the adjacent islands ; and against this, until some two
yeai's ago, there would have been nothing to advance except the suspicious
similarity and adjustment between the two gToups, the coincidence of their out-
lines, and of the way in which they have been cut and carried. But the admii-able
researches of Mr. Judd, in 1(S74, have brought one little fact to light which speaks
volumes for the enormous changes which must have taken place since the volcanoes
of the Miocene over a portion at least of the Highland area, and which may,
therefore, have taken place over the whole of it. The land upon which the
Miocene vegetation flourished, and upon which the lava-streams of its volcanoes
were poured out, seems to have been for the most part a land consisting of Cre-
taceous and Secondary rocks. The fragments of that country which remain are
generally consistent with the supposition that they were deposited in a sea which
washed round the bases of the Highland mountains, but which never covered
them. Like the fragments of the Old Red Sandstone, the remains of the Secondary
rocks lie along the margins and fringes of the Sikn-ian hills. But Mr. Judd has
made the startling discovery of an outlier of the whole series of the Secondary
rocks, including representative beds of the Trias, Lias, Greensand, and Chalk, to-
gether with deposits, probably Lacustrine, all lying on the top of one of the moun-

tains of metamorphic gneiss which constitute the district of Morven. This fragment
has been preserved by having been covered by a sheet of lava from some great neigh-
bouring volcanic centre, the position of which is probably indicated by Ben More
in MuU. But the mass of volcanic trap which has covered up and preserved this
relic of the Cretaceous land is itself a fragment occupying the top of a mountain of
gneiss, separated from the remainder of the sheet of lava to which it belongs by
deep valleys, precisely similar to those which di\ ide the hills from each other
throughout the whole area of the Highlands. This position of an outlier of the
Cretaceous rocks on the summit of a mountain of gneiss is rendered still more
curious by the circumstance that in that position the beds are not tilted or in any

way apparently distm-bed. They are arranged horizontally, as if the ocean floor in

which they were deposited had occupied that level, or as if its deposits had been
lifted up over so large an area that any small section of that area could retain its
original horizontality. The Lower Silurian gneiss beds on which these Secondary
deposits have been laid are violently twisted and contorted ; and this structure
must have belonged to them when they constituted the floor of the Cretaceous
sea. The position of the Miocene basalts capping the Secondary deposits proves
that the whole mormtain, as a mountain, is of later date than the Miocene age

how much later we cannot tell ; and thus that the causes of geological change

which have cut up the coimtry into its present form, though they doiibtless began
in very remote epochs, have at least been prolonged into a comparatively late age

in the history of the globe.

    It would, I think, be affectation to pretend that our science enables us to follow,
with any thing like distinctness of conception, the exact nature and sequence of
operations which through such a vast lapse of time have brought about the final
result. But I believe in something like the following general outline of events.

    Mrst. That subsequent not only to the consolidation, but probably also to the
metamorphism of the Lower Silurian deposits, the whole area of the Western-
Central Highlands became an area of that kind of disturbance which arose from
lateral pressm-e due to secular cooling and consequent conti-action and subsidence

of the crust of the earth.

    Second. That the crumpling, contortion, and tilting of the Silurian beds which

we now see arose fi'om that disturbance.

    Third. That then were determined those great general lines of strike running
                                                                                                  9*
--84 REPORT 1876.

from N.E. to S.W. which are to this day a prominent feature in the physical

geof^aphy of the country.
   Fourth. That during that period of disturbance, and as part of the movements

which tlien toolt place, the disturbed rocks fell inwards upon materials at a great
heat, which rose in a pasty state along the lines of least resistance, and thus
came to occupy various positions, sometimes intercalated among the sedimentary

beds.

   Fifth. That to this period, and to this method of protrusion we owe some at

least of the masses of granitic material which are abundant in the Highlands. Iq
particular, that to this period belong the porphyritic granites on the northern shores
of Loch Fvne.

   Sixth. That during the later ages of the Palaeozoic period, volcanic action
broke out at various points, accompanied by great displacement and dislocation of

strata, and that to this, with the denudation which followed, we owe much of the
very peculiar scenery of the south-western coasts, especially in the district of Lome

in Argyllshire.

   Seventh. That we have no proof that the Central Highlands were ever imder
the seas which laid down the deposits of the later Palasozoic age.

   Eighth. That such evidence as we have points ratlier to the conclusion that
they were not under those seas, since such fragments as remain of the Old Red

and of the Carboniferous rocks appear to have been deposited round the bases and
in the marginal hollows of the Silurian hills.

   Ninth. That in like manner we have no evidence that the great mass of the

Western or Central Highlands was ever under the seas of the Secondary ages,
which on the contrary, appear to have deposited their sediment upon an area outside
of, but probably suiTOimding, the area of those Ceuti-al Highlands, and certainly
upon their north-eastern and western flanks.

    Tenth. That the whole area of the Inner Hebrides and of the waters dividing
them, together with some portion of the mainland, as in Morven, was an area
occupied by Secondary rocks.

   Eleventh. That in the Tertiary ages, probably in the Eocene, and certainly in
the Miocene, these rocks formed the basis of a great land of unknown extent, very
probably extending for a great distance both to the east and west of the present
coasts of Scotland, and embracing the north of Ireland.

    Tioelfth. That this country became in the Miocene age, and possibly earlier, the
scene of great volcanic outbm-sts, which covered it with vast sheets of lava and
broke up its sedimentary rocks with every form of intrusive plutonic matter.

    Thirteenth. That later in the Tertiary periods, and perhaps as late as the
Pliocene, this volcanic country was itself broken up by immense subsidences and
upheavals, giving both occasion and direction to the agencies of denudation and
to enormous removals of material.

    Fourteenth. That this Tertiary country had been thus broken up and nothing
but its fragments left when the Glacial epoch began, and that the main outlines of
the country, as we now see it, had been already determined when glacial conditions
were established.

   Fifteenth. That thus the work of the Glacial period has been simply to degrade
and denude preexisting hills and to deepen preexisting valleys.

    Sixteenth. That during the Glacial epoch there was a subsidence of land to
the depth of at least 2000 feet below the level of the present sea, and again a

reelevation of the land to its present level.
    Seventeenth. That this reelevation has not restored the land to the level it

stood at before the subsidence began, but has stopped greatly short of it ; and that
the deep arms of the sea or lochs which intersect the country, and some of the
deeper freshwater lakes, such as Loch Lomond, are the valleys still submerged
whieli at the beginning of the Glacial epoch where high above the sea and furrowed

the flanks of loftier mountains.
   Eighteenth. That during the Glacial period the working of denudation and

--degradation was done, and done only by ice, in the three well-known forms : 1st,

of true glaciers descending mountain-slopes 2nd, of icebergs detached from the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

 sui'face ice, tlrivenbv currents which were determined indirection by the chang'ing'
 contours of the land during the processes of submersion and reelevation.

     It would be impossible on this occasion to illustrate or support these various
 propositions b}' going into the evidences on which they rest. But as those of them
 which relate to the operations of the txlacial epoch express a decided opinion upon

 questions now involving much dispute, I must say a few words in explanation and

 defence of that opinion.

    It will be seen that I disbelieve altogether in the theory of what is called an

 Ice-cap ; or, in other words, I hold that there is no evidence that there ever existed
 any universal mantle of ice higher or deeper than all the existing mountains, cover-
ing them and moving over them from distant northern regions.

    In the tii-st place, this theory presupposes conditions of climate which must have
 prevailed universally over the whole northern hemisphere ; whereas over a great
 portion of that hemisphere west of a certain meridian on the American continent,

all traces of general glaciation and of any general distribution of erratics disappear.

    In the second place, the theory assumes that masses of ice lying upon the surface
 of the earth, more than mountain-deep, would have a proper motion of their own,
capable of overcoming the friction not only of rough level surfaces, but even of the
steepest gradients, for which motion no adequate cause has been assigned, and
which has never been proved to be the natural consequence of any known force,
or to be consistent with the physical properties of the material on which it is
supposed to have acted.

    In the third place, as a matter of fact there do not now exist anywhere on the

globe masses of ice which can be proved to have any motion of this kind, or to be
subject to forces capable of driving and propelling it in this manner and with the
etlects which the theory assumes. The case of Greenland, which is often referred
to as an example, does not present phenomena at all similar to those attributed to

the ice-sheet.

    In the fourth place, all the phenomena of glaciation which are exhibited on the
mountain-ranges, including the distribution of erratics, can be adequately accounted
for by the three conditions or forms of moving ice which have been above

enumerated, and all of which are now in actual operation on the globe, nanielv :
ice mo\'iug, not up, but down mountain-slopes by the force of gravitation, and ice

floated by water and dri^^'en by cui-rents as icebergs or as Hoes.
   In the fifth place, these phenomena of glaciation are essentially different from

those which would result from the motion of a universal ice-sheet, even supposing
it to have existed and supposing it to have had the (improbable) motion which ha«
been ascribed to it.

   In the sixth place, and in particular, the mode in which erratics are distributed

and the peculiar position of perched blocks are demonstrative of the action
not of solid but of floating ice ; whilst the surfaces of rock, which have escaped
glaciation on one side and retain the deepest marks of it upon another, are
equally demonstrative of exposure to moving ice under conditions which did not
enable it to fit into the irregularities of surfaces over which it passed.

   In the seventh place, the phenomena seem to me to prove that some of the

--very heaviest work done by ice has been done towards the close of the Glacial

epoch when the land was emerging again from out of a glacial sea, and when all
the currents of that sea, loaded with bergs and iloes, were determined entirely by

the outlines of the rising land.

   In regard to the much disputed question of the glacial origin of Lake-basins,
the conclusion to which I have come is one which, to some extent, reconciles

antagonistic views. I do not, indeed, believe that glaciers can ever dig holes deep

under the average slope of the surface down which they move ; but, on the other
hand, they are the most powerful of all abrading agents in deepening their own
bed and cutting away the rocky surfaces which lie beneath them.

   If valleys thus deepened by the long work of glaciers and glacier-sti-eams are
afterwards submerged along with the whole country in which they lay, and if that
submergence is accompanied by partial and unequal rates of sub.sidence, they
would inevitably become hollows into which the sei would enter, or in which
fresh waters would accumulate. In this sense, and in this way, it can hai'dly
--86 KEPOHT 1876.

jidniit of a doubt that those lakes, which are nothing but submerged valleys, are due

in part to glacier action, although the other half of the causation on which they

depend is to be sought in the subterranean action of subsidence.

   In conclusion, I would observe that although the feet of a great subsidence and a
reelevation of the land dmiug the Glacial epoch has been generally admitted to be

one of the facts of which there is the clearest evidence, it is nevertheless a fact

of which all the conditions and all the consequences have been most imperfectly

recognized.

"S^'ithout venturing to go so far back as to imagine the process of subsidence and

submergence, let us only think for a moment of that movement of reelevation

which has certainly been one of the very latest of the great movements of geological
Kchange.
             it took place very gradually or very slowly, it necessitates the supposi-

tion that every inch of our mountain-surfaces, up to at least 2000 feet, has been in

succession exposed to the conditions of a sea-beach. Yet where are the marks

Weupon them of such conditions ?  may suppose such marks to have been

generally obliterated by later subaerial denudation. But against this is to be set

the fact that the position and distribution of perched blocks and other erratics

mydeposited by floating ice demonstrate, in  opinion, that very little indeed of

such denudation has taken place since they were placed where we now see them.

I could take any of you who are interested in this question to a precipitous hill

near Inverary, some 1200 feet above the level of the se;i, from the top of which you
can look down on the masses of transported rock stranded upon its sides and base,

precisely as one might look down from the top of some dangerous reef in the

--Eresent ocean upon the debris of a whole navy of ships shattered tipon it in some
  urricaue of yesterday. There they lie some more or less scattered, some heaped
upon and jammed against each other, with sharp angles and outlines wholly

unworn, and, moreover, so distributed that you see at a glance their strict relation to

the existing heights and hollows of the laud, which must here have been the shoals

and channels of tlie sea. These contours cannot have been materiall}^ changed

since that sea was there. It seems that it must have been tliere, geologically speak-

ing, only a very few days ago.

   And this conclusion would seem to be confirmed when we observe the phenomena

which are present in certain cases where the laud has clearly rested for a consider-

able time and the ocean has left in raised beaches the evidence of its work at

certain levels. Such raised beaches are to be found at many points all round our

western coasts ; but incomparably the finest and most instructive example of
them is to be seen on the west coast of the island of Jura, near the mouth of Loch

Tarbi.>rt, Jura, and extending for several miles to tlie north. These beaches are

visible from a great distance, because then rolled pebbles are composed entirely of

the hird white quartzite of the Jura mountains, which resists disintegration and

is very imfiivourable to the successful establishment of vegetation. I visited these

beaches a few weeks ago, and, measuring the elevation roughly with a graduated

aneroid, I found that they represent three more or less distinct stages of subsidence,

one beach being about the level of .50 feet above the present sea, another about 75

feet, and a third at about 12.5 feet. Some others, which I saw only fi-om a distance,
appeared to be higher ; and I believe, but am not quite sure, that further to the

north they have been traced to the level of 160 feet.
   But the feature connected with these sea-beaches, and especially with the

lowest or the 50-feet beach, is the evidence it affords, first, of the length of
time during which the ocean stood at that level, and secondly, and particularly,

of the very recent date at which it must have stood there. As regards tlie

length of time during which the ocean must ha-^-e stood there, it is sufficient

to observe the beautiful smoothness and roundness of the pebbles ; they have been
more thoroughly rolled and polished than the corresponding pebbles on the existing

shores, equalling in this respect the famous pebble-beds of the Chesil Beach at

Portland. Then, as regards the very recent date at whicli the ocean must have

stood there, it is difficult to give in words an adequate idea of the impression which

must be left on tlie mind of every one who looks at them. You see the curves left

 work of yestei'da}'. Is is difficult to conceive how ordinaiy atniospliei-ic agencies,

 and even the tread of sheep and cattle, should not have broken such an arrangement
 of loose material. But there are exc<iptionably f;\vourable circunistauces for the
 preservation of these beds, from absence of considerable streams and the protec-
 tion of surrounding- rocks. There is little or no evidence of glaciation anywhere
 around ; and although it is certain that the sea which stood at those beaches so
recently was a sea subject to glacial conditions, it is equally certain either that it
continued to work there after those conditions had passed away, or, what is more
probable, that that particular line of coast v/as protected from the drift of surroinid-

ing ice-floes.
    If, now, vre compare the evidence of recent action in these sea-beaches with the

similar evidence connected with the position of erratics at far higher levels, Avhicli
can only have been placed there by floating ice, I cannot help coming to the con-
clusion that the submergence and reelevation of the land to the extent of more
than 2000 I'eet above the level of the present ocean has been one of the very latest
changes in the history of this portion of the globe ; and, moreover, that the reeleva-
tion has been comparatively rapid, probably by lifts or hitclies of considerable
extent, and that there vvere few, if any, pauses or rests comparable in duration with
those recorded in the Jm-a beaches and in the cutting of the existing coasts.

   Finally, let me repeat that whether this conclusion is correct or not (and I
am well aware of the many difficulties which siuTound it), the general fact of sub-

mergence and reelevation is, perhaps, as certain as any conclusion of geological
science, and that the consequences of it in accounting for the distribution of gravtds
and the most recent changes of denudation hare never as yet been worked out with
any thing approaching- to consistency or completeness.

On tJie Suh-Wealden Exploration. D)j Major Beatthoxt, M.P.

On the Granite of Strath-Erricl; Lough Ness. Bi/ James Bryce, LL.D.

The author described a granite tract a little distance from the shores of Loch

Ness, and near the Fall of Foyers. This fall took place originally over a cliff of Old

Red Sandstone, and this stone being of a soft character gradually wore away until

it formed a magnificent basin almost inaccessible at the bottom, and the action of

the water had also worn the rock back to the slate which came between it and the

granite. His .attention had been called to the Loch-Ness granite tract by hearing

that gold had been fomid in the lower valley of the Nairn, which passes through

this granite district, and he supposed it probable that the gold might have its

source in this granite tract in the same way as he had found the granite of Suther-

la.ud to be the true source of gold. After describing the limits of the gi-anite

tract, he pointed out a most remarkable circumstance connected v.-ith its history,

which was illustrated by a section in a glen above Innerfaricaig. Here this triple

granite rises from the valley in a direction sloping eastward, at first leaning against

the Old Red Sandstone, and ultimately, further east, regularly overlying it, the

nielamorphism being very remarkable throug-h about a foot of depth, and portions

of gi-anite being embedded in the Old Red. On the east side of the hill the Old Red
Sandstone was regidarly overlapped by gi-anite, the strata of the Old Red dipping

imder it at an angle of 32 degrees. The well-known vitrified fort on the top of

the hill contains both rocks highly vitrified. To the west of this another hill rises

composed at the base of OldRed, audits upper part consisting of conglomerate granite.

He called the attention of the Section specially to this conglomerate granite, and to

the evidence which the whole district afforded that tlie granite here was truly

iiTuptive, and not of that hydrothermal origin to which the gi-anites furtlicr east

have been ascribed. The only conglomerate granite similar to this with which he

was acquainted was one that he had visited some years ago at Forkhill, county

Armagh                                      and he  called  attention,  especially of  Professor  Hull,  to  the  connexions

      On the Tidnl-Betardation Argument for the Age of the Earth.
By James Ckoll, LL.D., F.R.S., of the Geological Survey of Scotland.

Many years ago Sir William Thomson demonstrated from physical considerations

that the views which then prevailed in regard to geological time and the age of our

globe were perfectly erroneous. His two main arguments, as are well known,

were, first, that based on the limit to the sun's possible age, and, secondly,

that based on the secular cooling of the earth. More recently he has advanced a

third argument*, based on tidal retardation. It is well known that, owing to tidal

retardation, the rate of the earth's rotation is slowly diminishing, and it is therefore

evident that if we go back for many millions of years we reach a period when the

earth must have been rotating much faster than now. Sir William's argument is,

that had the earth solidified several hundred millions of years ago, the flattening

at the poles and the bulging at the eC[uator would have been much greater than

we find them to be. Therefore, because the earth is so little flattened, it must have

been rotating when it became solid at very nearly the same rate as at present.
And as the rate of rotation is becoming slower and slower, it cannot have been so

many millions of years back since solidification took place.

  A few years ago I ventured to point outf what appeared to be a very obvious

objection to the argument, viz. that the influence of subaerial denudation in alter-

ing the form of the earth had been entirely overlooked ; and as the validity of the

objection, as far as I am aware, has never been questioned, I had been induced to

believe that the argument referred to had been abandoned. But I find tliat Pro-

fessor Tait, in his work on ' Recent Advances in Physical Science,' restates the

argument as perfectly conclusive, and makes no reference whatever to my objection.

As the subject is one of veiy considerable importance, I may be permitted again to

direct attention to the objection in question, which briefly is as follows :

It has been proved by a method pointed out a few years ago|, and which is now

generally admitted to be reliable, that the rocky surface of our globe is being lowered

on an average, by subaerial denudation, at the rate of about 1 foot in 6000 years.

It follows as a consequence from the loss of centrifugal force resulting from the

retardation of the earth's rotation, occasioned by the friction of the tidal wave,

that the sea-level must be slowly sinking at the equator and rising at the poles.

This of course tends to protect the polar regions and expose equatorial regions to

Nowsubaei-ial denudation.  it is perfectly obvious that unless the sea-level at Ihe

equator has, in consequence of tidal retardation, been sinking during past ages at a

greater rate than 1 foot in GOOO years, it is physically impossible that the form of

our globe could have been very much different from what it is at present, whatever
may have been its form when it consolidated, because subaerial denudation would

have lowered the equator as rapidly as the sea sank. But in equatorial regions the

rate of denudation is no doubt much greater than 1 foot in 6000 j-ears, because the

rainfall is greater there than in the temperate regions. It has been shown in the

papers above referred to that the rate at which a country is being lowered by

subaerial denudation is mainly determined, not so much by the character of its

rocks as by the sedimentary carrying-power of its river-systems. Consequently,

other things being equal, the gi-eater the rainfall the greater will be the rate of

denudation.

  We know that the basin of the Ganges, for example, is being lowered by denu-

dation at the rate of about 1 foot in 2-300 years, and this is probably not very far

from the average rate at which the equatorial regions are being denuded. It is

therefore evident that subaerial denudation is lowering the equator as rapidly as the

sea-level is sinking from loss of rotation, and that, consequently, we cannot infer

fi'om the present form of our globe what was its form when it solidified. lu so far
as tidal retardation can show to the contrary, its form, when solidification took

place, may have been as oblate as that of the planet Jupiter.
   There is another circumstance which must be taken into account. The lowering

of the equator by the transference of the materials from the equator to higher lati-
tudes must tend' to increase the rate of rotation, or, more properly, it must tend to

lessen the rate of tidal retardation.

On the Variation in Thickness of the Middle Coal Measures of the Wigan

     Coal-field. By C. E. De Range, F.O.S., of H.M. Geological Survey.

   From the Arley Mine, the lowest coal-seam of this series, to the Tnce-Yard Coal,

at Worthington, north of Wigan, the measures are 2200 feet in thickness, thinning
50 feet per mile to the S.W. to Prescot, where the measures are only 1445 feet in
thickness, and 57 feet per mile to the N.E. towards Burnley, where the measures

--between the equivalents of these coals are only 1000 feet in thickness proving

the Wigan coal-basin to be not merely a synclinal of subsidence, but one of deposition,
the axis of which was shown to have gradually travelled northwards in time from
the district of St. Helens to a point north of Wigan. The importance of arranging

colliery sections in a definite geographical direction, and the importance of noting
the occurrence of very thin coal-seams and horizons of fire-clay and of seams full of
Anthracosia, were insisted on as means of identifying equivalent coal-seams across

a district. Great lateral shifts were shown to have occmTed between many of the
great N.N.W. faults which traverse the Wigan district and divide it up into a

series of belts.

    On Lahyrinthodont Remains fro77i the Upper Carboniferous (Gas- Coal)
                         of Bohemia. By Dr. Anton Feitsch,

   The beds of gas-coal which are now being worked at so many localities, both in

Europe and America, serve not only to illuminate our chambers, but to throw fresh

light upon many branches of pal8eontoloo;ical science ; for these beds of gas-coal

have been found to yield a remarkably fane -fauna, especially rich in the remains
of Labyrinthodonts, fishes, and insects.

   During the last five years, I have been so fortunate as to discover in Bohemia
two localities which afford us beautifully preserved relics of ancient life thus en-

tombed in the gas-coals.
   One of these localities is Nyran, near Pilsen, in the western part of Bohemia ; the

other is Kounova, near Kakonitz, in the north-west of the country.
    In both of these places the gas-coals are found to be situated on the top of the

Coal-measures proper, but beneath the true Permian deposits. The plants of these

beds are closely allied in character to those of the Coal-measures ; but the animals

appear to be of Permian types.
   I do not intend upon the present occasion to enter into a full enumeration and

description of these interesting fossils ; but I take the liberty of submitting to this
Section of the British Association series of specimens of casts and of plates of some
of these fossils which I have brought to this country for the purpose of comparing

them with the similar remains found in the British Coal-fields.
   The first three plates exhibited contain enlarged drawings of very small Laby-

rinthodonts of the gi'oup called by Prof. Huxley JNIicrosauria. One of these, not
more than one inch (?) long, has the skeleton completely ossified.

   The fourth and fifth plates are devoted to a large species of Luhjrinthodmi of

about 5 feet in length.

   Among the specimens, the author drew attention to the teeth of a Ctenodm, of

which species the bony parts of the skull were found preserved.
   Of the remarkable genus Diplodm a lower jaw with teeth served to show that

these latter are not, as was formerly supposed, the dermal spines of a Kay.

   Among the insect-remains was observed a new species of Gatnsom/chm, speci-

mens of which cover the whole surface of some slabs of the rock. The restored
--90 ' KJiFOKT 1876.

drawing illustrated the enlargement of the seventh pair of appendages iu this species
into swimming-feet.

   The species of Julus, called by the author J. conduns, shows how little the forms

of this genus have changed in the interval between Palasozoic and recent times.

   The rich materials which are now accumulated in the Museum of Prague will

require for their illustration about oO or 40 plates iu the mouogTaph which the

author is now preparing on this very interesting vertebrate fauna.

           On tlie Plvjsical Oeology and Geological Structure of Foula.
                       By Geokge a. Gibson, M.B., B.Sc. Edhth.

   Taking up, in the first place, the physiographical geology of the island, iu con-
nexion with the agencies involved, the paper describes the coast scenery, and dwells
"upon the contrast between the low and rugged eastern side and the stupendous
cliifs which overhang the western sea. This striking difference is shown to be due
partlj" to the superior powers of resistance to weathering evinced by the materials
of the sandstone rocks as contrasted with the crumbling schistose masses, aud also
to the fact that iu the former the strata dip away from the cliffs.

   The inland features are next taken up in detail. The five hills are found to bo
on the west side, three of them (Liorafield, the Sueug, and the Kauie, which, taken
by aneroid, reach 1000, 1250, and 1150 feet over sea-level) forming an axial chain,
w'hilst the other two (Soberly, CoO, and the Noup, 700 feet high) are distinct.
The last three are noticed as forming precipices from their summits sheer into the
sea, and all, except the Noup, whicli is dome-shaped, as having a conoid outline,
the steepest sides of which face the north and east. As the dip is S.S.W., these
hills are therefore held to have a contour in accordance with the empirical law,
noted above, that the strata dip away from the side wliich has the steepest slope.
The drainage is of course seen to be easterly.

   The lithological character of the rock masses is then detailed, along with their
architectural features and stratigraphical relations. The eastern side is described
as composed of gneiss, very similar to that of Loch Maree, aud of mica-schist with
intruded veins of granite, having a strike from N.W. to S.E., agreeing therefore

wiXh the presumably Laurentian of Scotland ; this, however, is not to be regarded as
of great significance, on account of the v.ariable strike of similar rocks in Shetland.

   The sandstone series is shown to be separated by a fault from the metamorphic
a-ocks, running from N.N.W. by N. to S.S.E. by S., and along which dislocation the
rocks are changed into hard quartz rock. There is described an unbroken succession
of sandstones and flags for two miles, at an average dip of more than 25°, whoso
thickness cannot bo estimated at less than 4400 feet.

   No fossils having been discovered in these rocks, they are then compared in litho-

logical character and position with the other sandstones of Slietland. DitFerences
in composition and texture are pointed out to be due to altered conditions of depo-
sition, the Bressay and I^Twick flags aud sandstones belonging, with the Foula
beds, to the Old iled Sandstone of the Caithness series.

    These beds are then identified, both by position and palisontological remains,
over the whole area, and lead to some important results. Kejecling the evidence
of fish- and plant-remains, which are inconclusive, the author finds that there is

--a strong palffiontological distinction between stages E and F the fauna of the one

(E) being essentially marine, that of the other (F) essentially estuariue or fresh-

water. The lists of species have been extracted from the memoirs of the Geological

Survey, the determination being those of the late Professor E. Forbes, Mr. Salter,

and Mr. Baily. The author of this paper is responsible for the determination of
the stratigraphical position of the beds from which the species have been obtained.

   EHe finds tnat there are about 53 species of marine genera in stage (Gannister

beds, or Lower Coal-measures)*, of which 33 come up from the Carboniferous

limestone, but only 4 or 5 pass up into the overlying stage F (Middle Coal-

measOTes), indicating a strong palKontological break.

   Again, of 8 marine species found at rare intervals in stage F (Middle Coal-
measures), 4 are peculiar to this zone, and the remainder are common to it and

stage E. The remaining species belong to the genera Anihracosia, Anthracomya,

&c., which some authorities regard as of freshwater origin, others estuaiinej they

are probably either : these genera pass into stage G.
   These differences, together with some of a stratigi-aphical nature, between stages

GF and on the one hand, and E, D, C on the other, are so striking that the author

submitted that they should be recogiaized in the classification of the beds ; and he
jiroposed to establisli a " Middle Carboniferous " division, to include all the stages

from the Yoredale (C) to the Gannister (E) inclusive. This stage would be
e.5Seutially marine ; while the term " Upper Carboniferous " would be restricted to

the stages F and G, which are shown to be estuariue or freshwater. The term

Lower Carboniferous would remain as at present, to designate the Carboniferous

ALimestone and basal beds of the system, stages and B.

   The author has reason to believe, from information supplied by Professor Roemer,

Eof Breslau, that the marine stage can be identified on the continent, both in

Belgium and Germany a band with Gonintites and Avicuhpecten occurring about
100 feet above the base of the Coal Measm-es, while, as we leam from Geinitz, the

mollusks of the Coal-formation generally belong to the genus Unio (Anthracosia),

so that this remarkable division, with its marine fauna, has had a range as wide as

the British Isles and Western Europe, and marks the upward limit of the essen-

tially marine conditions of the Carboniferous system.

    On a Deep Borhifj for Coal at Scarle, near Lincoln. Communicated by
                              Professor Edwakd Hull, F.B.S.

   This boring was undertaken about two years ago by a small company of Lincoln-
shire gentlemen under the advice of Mr. J. T. Boot, mining engineer, of Mansfield,

from whom I have received information and specimens constantly during the ope-

rations, besides having visited the locality in June 1875. The works have been
carried out by the Diamond Rock-boring Company, and specimens of the cores were

laid on the table.

   The temperature at 2000 feet was 79° F., taken with one of Negretti's thermo-
meters supplied by Professor Everett, of Belfast. At a depth of 917 feet a strong'
feeder of water was encountered in the Lower Keuper Sandstone, and a still stronger
at 12-50 in the Bunter Sandstone, when the water rose 4 feet above the ground.
This water uncjuestionably percolates underground from a distance of 10 or 12
miles, where the beds crop out.

    This boring is exceedingly interesting as giving the depth of the Carboniferous
rocks so far from the borders of the Nottinghamshire coal-field, and as giving the

thickness of the overlying formations ; but it has (unfortunately for the spii-ited

gentlemen who have undertaken it) not as yet produced any satisfactory results.
The Carboniferous beds are of so peculiar a character that I hesitate to attempt to

identify them with any particular division of the Carboniferous system. Mean-
while, as the boring is still being prosecuted, it is hoped that specimens of a more
definite nature may be brought up.

On Tertiary Basalt-rock Dykes in Scotland. By E. L. Jack, F.G.S.

            On some New Minerals, and on Doubly -refracting Garnets.
                                    By Dr. Von Lasatjlx.

   The writer exhibited specimens of the new mineral which he terms melnnophla-
gite, in consequence of its peculiaiity of becoming black when heated before the
bloAvpipe. It occurs in very small cubic crystals, of pale brown colour, seated on
little scalenohedra of calcite, which are associated with the sulphm- and celestine

of Girgenti, in Sicily. According to analyses, melanophlagite contains 815-29 per
cent, of silica, 7'2 of sulphuric acid, or some acid of the thionic series not yet de-
termined, 2'8 of strontia, 2-86 of water, and small quantities of alumina and ferric

oxide. Dr. Von Lasaulx also exhibited specimens of his new species aerinite, and

several microscopic sections of garnets which exhibited double refraction. He

entered into an explanation of the causes of such optical irregularities in monometric
crystals, and referred them partly to the effects of tension, partly to chemical altera-
tion, and partly to complexity of structure, due to alternations of isotropic and
anisotropic minerals. Thus the variety of garnet called colophonite appears to be a
mixtm-e of true garnet and idocrase ; hence, whilst one part exhibits single refrac-
tion, another part shows double refraction.

 On the Changes affecting the Southern Extension of the Lowest Carboniferous

                                   Bochs. Brj G. A. Lebottr, F.G.S.

    In Scotland the lowest division of the Carboniferous series consists of the rocks

called "the Calciferous Sandstones" by Maclaren, and usually known in the
north of England as " Tuedian." Prof. Geilde has shown that the lower limit of
these rocks merges insensibly into the upper portion of the Old Red Sandstone series.
In England their upper limit seems to be equally indefinite, and runs in a kind of

lateraf dovetailing into the lower beds of the Carboniferous Limestone series or
" Bernician." It is this merging of Tuedian into Bernician which forms the subject

of the paper. Some remarks as to the terminology of the series followed, and also

a short account of the higher divisions of the Carboniferous as represented in the

north of England, pointing out especially that the mode of deposition there was
nearly of the same character from the base of the Millstone Grit to the Old Red
series, a slight and very gradual change from brackish to purely marine conditions
beino' the only one of a sufficiently marked and important character to be taken

--into account. The author admits but two Carboniferous divisions the Upper, con-

sisting of Coal-measures, G annister beds, and Millstone-grit; andthe Lower, inclu-

ding the Bernician or Carboniferous Limestone and the Tuedian or Calciferous

Sandstones.

On the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy. By J. Macpadzean.

     On the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy. By Da\id Milne-Home, LL.D.

   The object of the author in this paper was to notice the views of Dr. Tyndall
given in a Lectm-e on Glen Roy, delivered in the Royal Institution, London, on

21st June, 1876.

   The author thought that Dr. Tyndall had allowed to himself too short a time,
viz. only two days, for an examination of the Lochaber district, as in that space it
was impossible to see more than a tenth part of the things which should be exa-
mined for a solution of the Parallel Roads problem.

   Dr. Tjndall had apparently gone to the district with preconceived opinions in

favour of the glacier theory to explain how the lakes had been confined. His know-
ledge of the Swiss glaciers eminently qualified him to see on the spot whatever

could be urged in support of that view. But, after all, the residt of Dr. Tyndall's

inspection had only satisfied him that there was a " probability " of the correctness
of the glacier theory, though a probability so great as in Dr. Tyndall's opinion to

" amount to a practical demonstration of its truth."
   To pave the way for the adoption of the glacier theory of lake-barriers, Dr. Tyn-

dall began his lectm-e by attempting to annihilate what seemed to him the only
other explanation worthy of notice, viz. that first suggested by Sir Thos. Dick Lauder,
and defended by Mr. Milne-Home, that the lakes were dammed by detrital blockage.

He states that this explanation may with safety be "dismissed as incompetent

to account for the present condition of Glens Gluoy and Roy."
    Dr. Tyndall, however, seems to have supposed that no better support could be

given to the detrital theory except what was stated in Sir Thomas Lauder's paper,
published about sixty years ago, ignoring altogether what had been advanced in

 support of the theory by later writes. He, for example, states that the detrital
barriers were supposed by Sir Thomas Lauder to have been heaped up by " some

unknown convidsion," a view which no one now suggests, and which Sir Thomas

 himself never entertained.

   What is stated in support of the detrital theory is, that a blockage existed at the

 mouths of the glens, created by the detritus, which then filled the vftlleys, and
 \\ hich reached even to tlie mountain tops at heights of nearly 2500 feet above the
 sea. Dr. Tyndall admits the abundance of detritus at these heights, and even allows

 that the Parallel Roads were formed on the detritus.
    Glen Collarig sliows that the baiTier there must have been only 700 or 800 yards
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

in length and about 300 feet in height, as the lakes in that Glen must have been
separated by a blockage of these dimensions.

    Dr. Tyndall alleges that all the glens on the south side of Glen Spean were filled
with ice, whilst those on the north side were filled with water. But so far from
there being evidence of these valleys being filled with ice, it appears that they also
were occupied by lakes, the traces of which are still visible in old beach lines.

   Even if there had been glaciers in Glens Treig and N'Eoiu, as suggested by Mr.
Jameson, it would have been impossible for these glaciers to have protruded tongues
long enough to have reached the places in Glens Hoy and Collarig where barriers
are required to have been.

        On High-level Terraces in Carron Valley, County of Liiilitlujow,
                             By David Milne-Home, LL.D.

   The river Carron runs into the Frith of Forth near Grangemouth. The princi-
pal tributary is the Bonny.

   The whole of that district situated to the east of the Kilsyth and Gargunnoch
hills is covered with deep beds of gravel and sand. The sand occurs in beds, mostly
stratified and generally horizontal.

   No marine fossils have been found in these drift-beds ; but the great probability

is that they are marine.

   The first set of ten-aces occur at a height of about 140 to 150 feet above the sea.
Flats at that height occur on both sides of the valley some miles west of Falkirk
these flats slope towards the eastward, i. e. towards the sea, so that near Grange-
mouth they very little exceed 50 or 60 feet above the sea.

   Terraces at a height of from 140 to 150 feet occur also in the upper parts of the
Carse of Stirling.

   The second set of terraces occurs only along the banks of the rivers, and is at a
height in the Carron of about 35 feet, and in the Bonny of about 29 feet above the

present coiu'se of these rivers.

   It is presumable that these haughs were formed when the Carron ran in a channel
about 27 feet above its present level, and when the Bonny ran about 23 feet above

its present level.

   The formation of these haughs indicates that the rivers had run permanently in
channels at that height. The sea therefore, in sinking, had paused in the process,
and had stood at a height of about 24 or 25 feet above the present level.

   This inference is confirmed by the fact of there being traces of an old sea-beach
at about that height visible along the coast of the Frith of Forth.

   The pebbles in the gi-avel-beds of the district are generally fragments of the hard
porphyry rocks of the Gargunnoch and Kilsyth hills, situated to the westward.
They could have come from no other quarter.

    Completion ; and on the Discovery of Staphylopteris, a Genus new to British

   The author stated that he had met with Sphenopteris qffitiis in the Carboniferous
" blaes " (shales) of an oil-shale pit at West Calder, near Edinburgh, in circinnate
vernation, and with it a curious form, apparently a Staphylopteris (?), new to British
rocks. Several species of this new genus have been found in Carboniferous rocks
by the officers of the Geological Survey of Illinois and Arkansas, in America; these
are figured and described by Leo Lesquereux in the Geological Transactions of those
States. The author stated that his difiered from all these, and thus, until more is
known about the British one, he had provisionally gi-\en it their generic name.

On the Mountain Limestone of the West Coast of Sumatra. By Dr, T. E.omee.

On the liaised Beach on tJie Cuniberland Coast, between Whitehaven and Boir-

On the coast of Cimiberland, between Workington and Bowness, the remains of

an old sea-beach can be most distinctly followed, and south from the former place

there is abundant evidence to show that the elevation of the laud marked by this

raised beach affected the whole of this portion of the west coast of Cumberland.

 --The characteristic appearance which the raised beach presents is a flat of greater

or less width stretching inland in some cases terminating at the base of a clifl", and

in other instances bounded by a flat from 4 to 5 feet below the level of the surface-

gravel of this old beach.

North of Workington we have an example of the former case, and at Silloth an

instance of the latter.

The surface of tliis flat is covered with a number of ridges approximately parallel

to the coast-line and to each other, and these ridges consist of sand and gravel par-

tially covered at various places along the coast with blown sand. This ridgy ap-

pearance is seen to be exactly like that portion of the present beach lying be-

tween the levels of the highest spring- and the highest neap-tides, where small

ridges of gravel are observed to be thrown up at the various difl'erent levels to which

the tide flows in the interval between the two periods above referred to. Tj'pical

examples characteristic of littoral" deposits are seen at Workington, Harrington,

St. Bees, and at numerous places along the coast.

The general resemblance between this upper teiTace and the present beach, even

in the absence of marine shells in the former, shows that the process of formation

in both cases must have been the same.

On the coast between AVorkington and AYhitehaven it exists in small isolated

patches, as at the north end of the ridge at Chapel Plill, at Harrington, at Partou,

and at AVhitehaven. From Worldngton northwards through Mar^-port to Brown

Rigg the line of an old sea-clift'is for the most part ver}' distinctly marked, at the

base of  which  occurs   a  flat  of from 40 chains  to 2 chains in breadth                                                                                      at Allonby
                                                                                                                                                              ;

this flat is bounded by a gravel or shingle ridge; while from Silloth north to Grune

Point, and across Morecambe Bay, from Anthorn to the Solway Viaduct, the country

on the east of the old beach consists of a loamy plain, several feet below the level of

this beach, from 3 to 4 miles broad, and dotted here and there with a few patches

of sand and gravel.

The height of the raised beach is from 20 to 25 feet, rarely exceeding 30 feet above

the present sea-level. However the base of the old sea-clifF from Oyster Bank to
Totter Gill, north of Workington, is .about 40 feet above mean sea-level, and there

is no distinctive cliff" marking a 2o-feet beach ; it would therefore seem that after

the tirst upheaval the elevation continued to take place very gradually until 40 feet
was attained, the beginning of the period of elevation being indicated by the level

of the land at the base of this cliff', and its close bj' the present sea-level.

  A consideration of the evidence to be obtained from Roman camps and other

remains along the coast seems to confirm the conclusion arrived at hy Mr. Milne-

Home in regard to the latest elevation of the land on the Scotch coasts, viz. that
it was prior to the Roman occupation of this country.

Notes on the Drifts and Boulders of the vpper part of the Valleii of the Wharfe^

            Yorlshire. By Rev. E. Sewell, M.A., F.G.S., F.Jt.G.S.

   It is evident that the Wharfe valley in many places must once have been filled

up to a certain height with gravelly drift and boulder-clays, containing a very
large quantity of Millstone-giit blocks, and that since then the river has exca-

vated a channel in the drift to the depth, in many places, of at least loO feet,
96 REPORT--1876.

Now if we suppose the gi-avelly drift to have heen deposited by the river Wharfe,

this must have taken place after the Glacial period, as it is clearly of newer date

than the two boulder-claj's. It would follow that the longitudinal slope of the

river-course and other conditions must first have been favourable to deposition, and

that afterwards the conditions changed, so as to enable the river to commence that

process of denudation, or carrying away, which is still going on.

While, however, it is somewhat difficult to conceive of postglacial changes so

great as these, necessitated by this theory of the fluviatile origin of the gravels,

we have no clear evidences of such changes having occurred since the final emer-

gence of the land above the glacial sea.

The rival theory that the gravels were deposited by the sea during the gradual

rise in the land accounts for their pell-mell and varied character, and for the exis-

tence of boulders lying at all angles. The latter may have been dropped from
floating ice which may still have lingered on the sm-face of the sea.

   At a considerable elevation above the channels of the Aire and Wharfe, and
where there is little or no clay or gravel, many angidar and subangular boulders of
limestone may be seen resting on Millstone-gi'it. They have chiefly been trans-
ported from between the north and west, and in many instances they would appear

to have crossed the intervening valleys and ridges. Mr. Mackintosh mentions two
limestone erratics near the south-west corner of Embsay Moor, at an altitude of

about 1100 feet above the sea. They may likewise be seen on Barden Moor, and a

large number have been found at Barden Reservoir, about one mile south-west of

ABarden Tower.  few small fragments of limestone may be found resting on the

Millstone-gi'it of Rombolds Moor, south of Ilkley, at a height of at least 1100 feet

above the sea.

   On the east side of the Wharfe valley, near " Appletreewick," there is a hill,
consisting of Millstone-gi-it, called Symonds Seat (marked in the Ordnance Map
Earls Seat). On the side of this hill limestone fragments, which must have come
from the west or north-west, may be traced up to a height of 1200 feet above the

sea, but not to a greater height, as I lately ascertained.

   At High Skyi-eholme, or Trollas Ghyll, about a mile to the north of this hiU,

are found a most interesting series of limestone-ravines, ranging east, north-east,
and south-east, whose almost perpendicular sides rise 300 feet, their summits being

not less than 150 yards distance from each other, 1200 feet above the level of the

sea. On their rugged bottoms are scattered vast numbers of huge blocks of Mill-

stone-grit in all directions.

The whole of this district is, geologically, exceedingly interesting.
The author believes it may now be regarded as a fact there are no erratics on the

eastern slope of the north Pennine Hills in the district under notice at a greater height

above the sea than 1200 feet. On the western slope it is well known that they have

reached a considerably greater altitude.

On cei-tain pre-Carhoiiiferoas and Metamorphosed Trap-dyhes and the Asso-
   ciated Hocks of North Mayo, Inland. By William A. Traill, M.A.I.,
    F.E.6.S.I., H.M. Geological Survey of Ireland.

   The author first described the locality in North Mayo lying between Downpatrick
Head and Broad Ilaveu, and referred to the geological map of Sir Richard

GrilBth.

   The physical features presented precipitous coast sections at Keady Point 352
feet high, and at I^euwee Head 829 feet high, in bold and perpendicular headlands.

   The geological t'ormatious comprising the older or metamorphic rocks lying to the
westward consist of flaggy quartzites and micaceous schists, often much contorted
and overlapped. The newer or Carboniferous rocks extending from the Glenglassera
river eiistward, with a primary dip E.N.E. at low angles, comprise white, yellow,
and red sandstones, vrith green and red shales, and limestone b.mds and beds

further eastward.

   These Lower Carboniferous sandstones rest uncouformably on the metamorphic
rocks, which is best seen along one side of a fault at Fohernadeevaun, at the mouth
of the Glenglassera river. The basal bed of the Carboniferous strata is a con-
glomerate of from 1 to 4 feet in thickness, merging into the overlying sand-

stone beds.

   With all due deference to the author of the geological map referred to, the presence

of the baud of 1 )evonian rocks, as there represented, intermediate between the meta-
morphic and Carboniferous rocks, was called in question and regarded as not

existing in that locality.

   The inlrusive igneous rocks of the district, though much resembling each other,
and both belonging to the basaltic type, were shown to belong to two distinct

epochs with regard to their time of formation, and also to possess characteristic

distinctions.

   The older set are undoubtedly of pre-Carboniferous age, as unmistakable frag-
ments are found in the basal conglomerate of the Carboniferous rocks, and they
seem to have existed before and to have been metamorphosed with those beds
among which thej' had been intruded. They largely penetrate the metamorphic
rocks, but are not found witliiu the area of the Carboniferous strata. They occur
chiefly in sheet-like dykes up to 150 feet in thickness, and are often contorted with
the beds they penetrate, though apparently the cause of some of the minor crump-
lings. They are seldom hexagonal, spheroidal, or amygdaloidal in structure.

   As examples of these, specimens were exJiibited and detailed descriptions given

of dykes on I5eniuore and Gleucalry, at 13elderg Harbom-, and Laghtmurragha,
showing the effects of the metamorphic action iipon them, viz. the change from a
hard splintery iidcrocrystalline basalt towards the centre, to a fibrous hornblendic
schistose rock, vv'ith soft green chlorite and nests of green chloritic mica, the ex-
terior becoming very schistose, platy, and micaceous, resembling a mica-schist ; in
part, theso might be considered diabases. The felspar is plagioclastic and has a cha-
racteristic white weathering in crystalline mottliugs through the greenish base.

   The adventitious minerals frequently present are mica, chlorite, epidote, garnets,
hornblende, quartz, calcite, varieties of felspar, and iron pyrites.

   The newer set, or post-Carboniferous dykes, are probably of Tertiary age, and
seem to fill cracks or tissiu-es or lines of faults. They are basalts mostly in vertical
dykes, and always cut the sheet-like dykes, and are frequently hexagonal, sphe-
roidal, or amygdaloidal in structure, and usually bear W.N.VV. and E.S.E., and

seldom exceed 25 feet in width. By their decomposing they separate many of

the small islands from their respective headlands by narrow precipitous gullies, or
form chasms into the cliifs : one of these clefts has vertical walls over 450 feet
high, and in part does not exceed some 10 feet in width; this same fissure also

cuts off some four islands from their adjacent headlands, the view down which is

almost unique.

    Recent Researches into the Organization of some of the Plants of the Coal-

                measures. By Professor W. C. Williamson, F.ll.tS.

    In bringing the subject before the Geological Section the author chiefly aimed
at demonstrating the structural identity of Calamites and Calamodendron and of
Lepidodetidron and Sigillaria. The stems of Calamites described in his first
memoir published in the 'Philosophical Transactions ' were very young ones, in which
the highly distinctive Oalamitean organization was well preserved, and in one of
which the vascular cylinder, composed of a ring of detached woody wedges, was

enclosed in a thin parenchymatous imdifferentiated bark. He now exhibited a series

of specimens, beginning with one less than ^^ inch in diameter, in which the vas-
cular cylinder was represented by little more than a circle of the canals, one of
which is located at the inner angle of each vascular wedge, and in which tjie bark
was thin imditierentiated parenchyma. From this starting point, the author passed
through a series of intermediate examples up to one in which a large pith was sur-
rounded by a cylinder of vessels having a circumference of 15 inches, and which in
turn was enclosed within a bark 2 inches in thickness. The outer portions of the
vascular cylinder had lost most of the special arrangements of its tissues so charac-

teristic of young stems, which were now modified into a mass of thin radiating vas-

cular wedges, separated by equally thin medullary rays, the condition being almost
identical at the nodes and at the internodes. T"he tark also is now differentiated
into two layers, an inner parenchyma and a thick outer prosenchyma, the cells of
the latter assuming the prismatic type. There is little or no doubt that externally
to this the living plant possessed at least a third layer of parenchyma not preserved

in the author's specimen.

  A series of sections was then exhibited, demonstrating the erroueousness of

Bronguiart's distinction between Lepidodendron and Siyillaria. The author had

previously pointed this out in the case of the Lcpidodei.dra chaiacteristic of the

lowermost Carboniferous rocks obtained from the Burntisland deposit. He now
showed that it was equally true of the common L. selayinoidcs of the Upper Coal-

measures, whilst L. hnrcouriii has only the structure long ago described by Brong-
niart, viz. an inner vascular cylinder not developed exogeuously. All the other
Lepidodendra referred to possess an outer exogenous cylinder such as Bronguiart
believed to be characteristic of Sitjillaria, and which exists in the Anahathra of

Witham and tlie Diploxijlon of Corda. The author thus concludes tliat the Lepi-

dodendron harcourtii represents the lowest degi-ee of development seen amongst the
Lepidodendra, as isigillaria exhibited the highest, whilst the Lepidudcndrcn selagi-
noides of the Middle Coal-measures occupies an intermediate position.

On the Junction of Ghranite and Old Red Sandstone at Corrieand GlenSannox,
                          Arran. By E. A. WiJNscH, F.O.S.

   The object of this paper is to show by specimens and diagrams that the rock
intervening between the granite and the stratified rocks on the nortli-east coast of
Arran is not, as held by Professor Kanisay and Dr. Bryce, a band of slate. There
 8 no slate in all Glen Sannox, nor as far south as Brodick Castle. The sedimentary
rocks, Old Red and Carboniferous, cropping upon the shore, retain in a remarkable
manner the same general dip, the initial direction of which is given to them by
the great anticlinal axis of mid Sanuox, and abut right against the granitic nucleus

of the island.

   As we approach the junction, at a height of about 800 feet from the sea-level,

the angle of inclination becomes more highly inclined, and the hitherto clearly
stratified beds assume a granitoid structure.

   At the point of cont,act the Old Red iSaudstone is so altered as to resemble slate,
and was mistaken for such and circumstantially mapped down as an extensive

band of slate by Dr. Bryce ; but no one can mistake the real character of the rock
if he begin his examination in the bed of the burn, about 60 yards below the

junction, where the Old Red Sandstone is seen exposed in its unaltered state, fine-

grained and of the usual deep red colour, dipping S.E. at an angle of about 45°;
and starting from this point the griidually altered character of the rock becomes

apparent every few yards as we proceed towards the junction.
   The first appearance of change is shown in a series of chocolate-coloured rocks

with greenish veins and streaks traversing them ; and as these become more indu-
rated they turn lighter in colour, and take on a beautifully mottled appearance,
closely resembling variegated marble, and finally, within a few yards of the junc-
tion, the rock turns dark grey or almost black. The actual contact is beautifully
seen on the almost perpendicular face of the rock, under a waterfall formed by the

small burn Howing over the lip of the Come south of the grand peak of Ciod-na-

oigh.

   Identically the same appearances are observed when ascending up to the granite
in the bed of the " White Water," the falls of which form a conspicuous landmark

on the hillside above Oorrie.

   The author made these two points typical, and his specimens and diagrams re-
ferred to them ; but numerous other sections are laid bare in the small bums and
ravines intersecting tlie hillside, and bear out the same conclusions.

   The author showed a diagram from Oon'ie to the White Water, showing that if
it were not for the extensive denudation that has taken place we shoidd probably
see the Carboniferous rocks abutting against the granite, as they must originally
have done. lie also gave an enlarged copy of Dr. Bryce's map of the localities
referred to, accompanied by a dtiplicate map of the same localities and on the same
scale, with the supposed slate replaced by the Old Red Sandstone. In Glen Sannox

burn the junction appears to take place by contact of the granite with the ma.ssive

Old Red conglomerate, and he was able to exhibit specimens quarried out of the
bed of the burn showing large rounded quartz pebbles in a state of semifusion and
the matrix of the rock traversed by alternate black bands and streaks and white
seuiigrauitic veins and patches; but though the actual junction must be within a
few yards of the spot where he quarried, he was unable to lay it bare, owing to the

deep water and the mass of gravel and sand in the bed of the burn.

   lie also mentioned that everywhere at the point of contact with the Old Red
Sandstone the granite is delicately mottled or clouded (as shown by his polished

specimens), as if the black tilui of the absorbed mass had remained floating and

become lixed in the white pasty mass. And this appearance he holds is in itself

sulhcient to point to a junction of granite with rock other than slate ; for though

innumerable instances may be seen in other parts of the island of junctions of

granite witli true slate, in not a single instance is the adjoining granite atl'ected

in this particular manner.

      On Siliceous Sponges from the Carboniferous Limestone near Qlasgow.

                                 By John Young, F.G.S.

   The author exhibited a series of mounted specimens of sponge-spicula re-
cently obtained from a deposit of rotted limestone filling fissures in the Carbo-

niferous Limestone series at Cunningham Bedlaud, near Dairy, Ayrshire. He

stated that the discovery of the spicules was due to the investigation of the
deposit by Mr. John Smith, of the Geological Society ot Glasgow. lie was not
aware of similar sponge-spicules having been found in any other Carboniferous
Limestcme district within the British Isles, and their abundant occurrence in this

deposit testified to the e.\istence of sponges witli large siliceous spicula over this
tract of the Scottish Carboniferous sea-bottom.

                          BIOLOGY.

Address by Alfred Russel Waixace, F.R.G.S., F.L.S., President of the

                                                                 Section.

The range of subjects comprehended within this Section is so wide, and my
own acquaintance with them so imperfect, that it is not in my power to lay

before you any general outline of the recent progress of the biologisal sciences.
Neither do I feel competent to give you a summary of the present status

of any one of the great divisions of our science, such as Anatom}^, Physiology,

--Embryology, Histology, Classification, or Evolution Philology, Ethnology, or

Prehistoric Archaeology ; but there are fortunately several outlying and more or

less neglected subjects to which I have for some time had my attention directed,

and which I hope will fui-nish matter for a few observations of some interest to
biologists, and be at the same time not unintelligible to the less scientific members

of the Association who may honour us with their presence.

The subjects I first propose to consider have no general name, and are not easily

grouped  under a  single  descriptive  heading                                          but  they  may  be  compared with
                                                                                     ;

that recent development of a sister science which has been termed Surface-

geology or Earth-sculpture. In the older geological works we learnt much about

strata, and rocks, and fos?ils, their superposition, contortions, chemical constitution,

and affinities, with some general notions of how they were formed in the remote
past; but we often came to the end of the volume no whit the wiser as to how
and why the surface of the earth came to be so wonderfully and bcauti-
fullv diversified ; we were not told why some mountains are rounded
and others precipitous ; why some valleys are wide and open, others narrow and
rocky; why rivers so often pierce through mountain-chains; why mountain

lakes are often so enormously deep; whence came the gravel, and drift, and

erratic blocks so strangely spread over wide areas while totally absent from

other areas equally extensive. So long as these questions were almost ignored,

geology could hardly claim to be a complete science, because, while professing to

explain how the crust of the earth came to be what it is, it gave no intelligible

account of the varied phenomena presented by its surface. But of late years these
surface-phenomena have been assiduously studied ; the marvellous effects of denu-

dation and glacial action in giving the final touches to the actual contour of the
earth's surface, and their relation to climatic changes and the antiquity of man,

have been clearly traced, thus investing geology with a new and popular interest,
and at the same time elucidating many of the phenomena presented in the older

formations.

  Now just as a surface-geology was required to complete that science, so a surface-

biology was wanted to make the science of living things more complete and more

generally interesting, by applying the results arrived at by special workers to the in-
terpretation of those external and prominent features whose endless variety and beauty

constitute the charm which attracts us to the contemplation or to the study of nature.

The descriptive zoologist, for example, gives us the external characters of ani-
mals ; the anatomist studies their internal structure ; the histolog'st makes known

to us the nature of their component tissues; the embryologist patiently watches
the progi'ess of their development ; the systematist groups them into classes and

orders, families, genera, and species ; while the field-naturalist studies for us their

food and habits and general economy. But till quite recently none of these earnest

students, nor all of them combined, could answer satisfactorily, or even attempted

to answer, many of the simplest questions concerning the external characters and

Whygeneral relations of animals and plants.                                             are fiowers so wonderfully varied

in form and colour? what causes the Arctic fox and the ptarmigan to turn white

in winter ? why are there no elephants in America and no deer in Auslriilia?

why are closely allied species rarely found together? why are male animals so

frequenth' bright-coloured? why are extinct animals so oltcu larger tjian tho.se

which are now living? what has led to the production of the gorgeous train of

the peacock and of the two kinds of flower in the primrose ? The solution of
                                                                                      ;;

these and a hundred other problems of like nature was rarely approached by the

old method of study, or if approached was only the subject of vague speculation.

It is to the illustrious author of the ' Origin of Species ' that we are indebted for

teaching us how to study nature as one great, compact, and beautifully adjusted

system. Under the touch of his magic wand the countless isolated facts of internal

--and external structure of living things their habits, their colours, their develop-
--ment, their distribution, their geological history, all fell into their approximate

places; and although, from the intricacy of the subject and our very imperfect

knowledge of the facts themselves, much still remains uncertain, yet we can no

longer doubt that even the minutest and most superiicial peculiarities of animals

and plants either, on the one hand, are or have been useful to them, or, on the

other hand, have been developed under the influence of general laws, wliicli we

may one day understand to a much greater extent than we do at present. So

great is the alteration effected in our comprehension of nature by the studv of

--variation, inheritance, cross-breeding, competition, distribution, protection, "and

selection showing, as they often do, the meaning of the most obscure phenomena

--and the mutual dependence of the most widely-separated organisms that it can

only be fitly compared with the analogous alteration produced in our conception of

the universe by Newton's grand discovery of the law of gravitation.

1 know it will be said (and is said) that Darwin is too highly rated, that some

of his tlieories are wholly and others partially erroneous, and that he often builds

a vast superstructure on a very uncertain basis of doubtfully interpreted I'acts. Now,

--even admitting this criticism to be well founded and I myself believe that to a
--limited extent it is so I nevertheless maintain that Darwin is not and canuot be

too highly  rated                            for his greatness  does  not at all depend upon his being infallible,
                                          ;

but on his having developed, with rare patience and judgment, a new system of

observation and study, guided by certain general principles which are almost as

simple as gravitation and as wide-reaching in their eii'ects. And if other principles

should hereafter be discovered, or if it be proved that some of his subsidiary theoi-ies

are wholly or partially erroneous, this very discovery can only be made by "following

in Darwin's steps, by adopting the method of research which he has taught us, and

by largely using the rich stores of material which he has collected. The ' Origin

of Species, ' and the grand series of works which have succeeded it, have revolu-

tionized the study of biology : they have given us new ideas and fertile principles

they have infused life and vigour into our science, and have opened up hitherto

unthought-of lines of research on which hundreds of eager students are now la-

bouring. Whatever modifications some of his theories may require, Darwin mast

none the less be looked up to as the founder of philosophical biology.

As a small contribution to this great subject, I propose now to call your atten-

tion to some curious relations of organisms to their environment, which seem to me

--wortliy of more systematic study than has hitherto been given them. The points

I shall moi-e especially deal with are the influence of locality, or of some unknown

local causes, in determining the colours of insects, and, to a less extent, of birds

and the way in which certain peculiaiities in the distribution of plants may have

been brought about by their dependence on insects. The latter part of my address

will deal with the present state of our knowledge as to the antiquity and early his-

tory of mankind.

            On some Behitmis of Livimj Things to their Environment.

   Of all the external characters of animals, the most beautiful, the most varied, and
the most gener.ally attractive are the brilliant colours and strange yet often elegant
markings ^yith which so many of them are adorned. Yet of all characters this is

-- --the most difficult to bring under the laws of utility or of physical connexion. Mr.

Darwin as you are well aware has shown how wide is the influence of sex on

the intensity of coloration ; and he has been led to the conclusion that active or
voluntary sexual selection is one of the chief causes, if not the chief cause, of all

the variety and beauty of colour we see among the higher animals. This is one
of the points on which there is nuich divergence of opinion even among the siip-

porlers of Mr. Diirwin, and one as to which T myself difler from him. I liave

argued, and still believe, that the need of protection is a far more efficient cause of

variation of colour than is generally suspected ; but tliore are evidently other causes

at work, and one of these seems to be an influence depending strictly on locality,

whose nature we cannot yet understand, but whose effects are everywhere to be

seen when carefully searched for.

 --Although the careful experiments of Sir John Lubbock have shown that insects

can distinguish colours as might have been inferred from the brilliant colours of

--the flowers which .are such an attraction to them yet we can hardly believe that
their appreciation and love of distinctive colours is so refined as to guide and regu-
-- Welate their most powerful instinct that of reproduction.
                                                              are therefore led to

seek some other cause for the varied colours that prevail among insects ; and as

--this variety is most conspicuous among butterflies a group perhaps better known
--tlian any other it offers the best means of studying the subject. The variety of

colour and markingamong these insects is something marvellous. There are probably

about ten thousand different kinds of butterflies nowlaioviTi, and about ban of these

are so distinct in colour and marking that they can be readily distinguished by this

means alone. Almost everj' conceivable tint and pattern is represented, and the

liues are often of such intense brilliance and purity as can be equalled by neither

birds nor flowers.

   Any help to a comprehension of the causes which may have concurred in bring-
ing about so much diversity and beauty must be of value ; and this is my excuse for

lajing before you the more important cases I have met with of a connexion between

colour and locality.

Our first example is from tropical Africa, where we find two unrelated groups of

butterflies belonging to two very distinct families (Nymphalidre and Papilionidaa)

characterized by a pi-evailing blue-green colour not found in any other continent *.

Again, we have a group of African Pierida} which are white or pale yellow with a

marginal row of bead-like black spots ; and in the same country one of the Lycfenidne

(Leptena erasius) is coloured so exactly like these that it was at first described as

a species of Pieris. None of these four groups are known to be in any way speci-

ally protected, so that the resemblance cannot be due to protective mimicry.

   In South America we have far more strilring cases ; for in the three subfamilies
DanaincB, Acrames, and Helicominee, all of which are specially protected, we find

identical tints and patterns reproduced, often in the greatest detail, each peculiar

type of coloration being characteristic of distinct geographical subdivisions of the

continent. Nine very distinct genera are implicated in these parallel changes

Lycorea, Ceratinia, Mechanitis, Ithomia, MeUiKea, Tithorea, Acraa, HeUconiiis, and

Eueides, gi-oups of three or fom- (or even five) of them appearing together in the

same livery in one district, while in an adjoining district most or all of them undergo

a simultaneous change of coloration or of marlnng. Thus in the genera Ithomia,
Mechanitis, and Heliconius we have species with yellow apical spots in Guiana, all

represented by allied species with white apical spots in South Brazil. In Mecha-

nitis, 3Ielin(ea, and Heliconius, and sometimes in Tithorea, the species of the

Southern Andes (Bolivia and Peru) are characterized by an orange and black livery,

while those of the Northern Andes (New Granada) are almost always orange-yellow

and black. Other changes of a like nature, which it would be tedious to enumerate,
but which are very striking when specimens are examined, occur in species of the

same groups inhabiting these same localities, as well as Central America and the

Antilles. Tlie resemblance thus produced between widely different insects is some-

times general, but often so close and minute that only a critical examination of

structure can detect the difference between them. Yet this can hardly be true              1

mimicry, because all are alike protected by the nauseous secretion which renders
them unpalatable to birds.

   In another series of genera {Catagramma, CaUithea, and Ai/rias), all belonging to

tlie Nymphalidse, we have the most vivid blue ground, with broad bands of orange-

crimson or a different tint of blue or purple, exactly reproduced in corresponding,

yet unrelated species, occui-iing in the same locality yet, as none of these gi-oups
                                                          ;
Aare protected, this can hardly be true mimiciy.
                                                  few species of two other genera

   * Bo7nalcosoina and Euniphcne (Nymphalidre), PajMlio s:almo.ris and several species of

TRANSACTIONS OF TttE SECTIONS.  103

in tliG same country {Eunica and Siderone) also reproduce the same Colours, but

with only a general resemblance in the marking. Yet, again, in Tropical America

we liave species of Apatura which, sometimes in both sexes, sometimes in the

female only, exactly imitate the peculiar markings of another genus (Ileterockroa)

confined to America : hei'e, again, neither genus is protected, and the similarity
must be due to unknown local causes.

   But it is among islands that we find some of the most striking examples of the

influence of locality on colour, generally in the direction of paler, but sometimes of

darker and more brilliant lines, and often accompanied by an unusual increase of

size. Thus in the Moluccas and New Guinea we have several Papilios (P. eucheno);

P. onnenus, and P. fydetts) distinguished from their allies by a much paler colour,
especially in the females, which are almost white. INfany species of Danais
(forming the subgenus Ideopsis) are also very pale. But the most curious are the

Euploeas, which in the larger islands are usually of rich dark colours, while in the

small islands of Banda, Ke, and Matabello at least three species not nearly related

to each other {E. hoppferi, E. enripon, and E. assimilata) are all broadly banded or

suffused with white, their allies in the larger islands being all very much darker.

Again, in the genus Diademn, belonging to a distinct family, three species from

the small Aru and K6 islands {D. deuis, D. heicitsoini, and I). 2}oli/me»a) are all

more conspicuously white-marked than their representatives in the larger islands.

In the beautiful genus Cethosia, a species from the small island of Waigiou (C

cyrene) is the whitest of the genus. Protho'e is represented by a blue species in

the continental island of Java, while those iuhabitiug the ancient insular groups

of the Moluccas and New Guinea are all pale yellow or white. The genus Driisilla,

almost confined to these islands, comprises many species which are all very pale
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

while in the small island of Waigiou is found a very distinct genus, Hyantis, which,
though diifering completely in the neuration of the wings, has exactly the same
pale colours and large ocellated spots as DrustUa. Equally remarkable is the fact
that the small island of Amboina produces larger-sized buttei"flies than any of the
larger islands which surround it. This is the case with at least a dozen butterflies
belonging to many distinct genera*, so that it is impossible to attribute it to other
than some local influence. In Celebes, as I have elsewhere pointed outf, we have
a peculiar form of wing and much larger size running through a whole series of
distinct butterflies ; and this seems to take the place of any speciality in colour.

   From the Fiji Islands we have comparatively few butterflies ; but there are

several species of Diadema of unusually pale colours, some almost white.
    The Philippine Islands seem to have the peculiarity of developing metallic colours.

We find there at least three species of Eiiplcea J not closely related, and all of more

intense metallic lustre than their allies in other islands. Here also we have one of
the large yellow Ornit/iopterce (0. 7nageUanus), whose hind ^;\ings glow with an

intense opaline lustre not found in any other species of the entire group ; and an
AdoHas § is larger and of more brilliant metallic colouring than any other species

in the archipelago. In these islands also we find the extensive and wonderful

genus of weevils {Pachyrhijnchm) , which in their brilliant metallic colouring
surpass any thing found in the whole eastern hemisphere, if not in the whole

world.

   In the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal there are a considerable number

of peculiar species of butterflies differing slightly from those on the continent, and
generally in the direction of paler or more conspicuous colouring. Thus two

species of Papilio which on the continent have the tails black, in their Andaman
representatives have them either red- or white-tipped ||. Another species IT is richly

blue-banded where its allies are black ; while three species of distinct genera of

N vmphalidae * all diiFer from their allies on the continent in being of excessively

pale colours as well as of somewhat larger size.

In Madagascar we have the very large and singularly white-spotted Papilio cm-

tenor, while species of three other genera f are very white or conspicuous compared

with their continental allies.

Passing to the West-Indian Islands and Central America (which latter country

has formed a group of islands in very recent times) we have similar indications.

One of the largest of the Papilios inhabits Jamaica J, while another, the largest of

its group, is found in Me.xico §. Cuba has two of tlie same genus whose colours

of surpassing brilliancy                                                                                                 while  the  fine genus  Clothilda  confined to the

--Antilles and Central America is remarkable for its rich and showy colouring.

Persons who are not acquainted with the important structural difterences that

distinguish these various genera of butterflies can hardly realize the importance

and the significance of such facts as I have now detailed. It ma}' be well, there-

fore, to illustrate them by supposing parallel cases to occur among the Mammalia.

We might have, for example, in Africa, the gnus, the elands, and the buffaloes,

all coloured and marked like zebras, stripe for stripe over the whole body exactly

corresponding. So the hares, marmots, and squirrels of Europe might be all red

with black feet, while the corresponding species of Central Asia were all yellow

with black lieads. In North America we might have raccoons, squirrels, and

opossums in parti-coloured livery of wliite and black, so as exactly to resemble the

skunk of the same country ; while in South America they might be black with a

yellow throat-patch, so as to resemble with equal closeness the tayra of the Brazilian

forests. Were such resemblances to occur in any thing like the number and with

the wonderful accuracy of imitation met with among the].,epidoptera, they would

certainly attract imiversal attention among naturalists, and would lead to the

exhaustive study of the influence of local causes in producing such startliug results.

   One somewhat similar case does indeed occur among the Mammalia, two singular

African animals, the Aard-wolf (Froteles) and the ]iya3ua-dog (Lj/caon), both

strikingly resembling hyaenas in their general form as well as in their spotted

markings. Belonging as they all do to the Carnivora, though to three distinct

families, it seems quite an analogous case to those we have imagined ; but as the
Aard-wolf and the hytena-dog are both weak animals compared with the hyama,

the resemblance may be useful, and in that case would come under llie head of

mimicry. This seems the more probable because, as a rule, the colours of the

Manmialia are protective, and are too little varied to allow of the influence of local

causes producing any well-marked effects.

  When we come to birds, however, the case is diflerent ; f n- although tJiey do

not exhibit such distinct marks of the influence of locality as do butterflies--pro-

bably because the causes which determine colour are in their case more complex

yet there are distinct indications of some effect of the kind, and we must devote

some little time to their consideration.

One of the most curious cases is that of the parrots of the AVest-Indian Islands

and Central America, several of which have white heads or foreheads, occun-ing in

two distinct genera 51, while none of the more numerous parrots of South America
are so coloured. In the small island of Dominica we have a very large and richlv-

coloured parrot {Chri/sotis aiif/usta) corresponding to the large and richly-coloured

Papilio homcrn^ of Jamaica.

The Andaman Islands are equally remarkable, at least six of the peculiar birds

diffeiing from their continental allies in being much lighter, and sometimes with

a large quantity of pure white in the plumage**, exactly corresponding to what

occurs among the butterflies.

light ashy tints. The birds generally, however, have rich dark colours, similar to

those which prevail among the butterflies.

h\ Celebes we have a swallow-shrike and a peculiar small crow allied to the

jackdaw *, whiter than any of their allies in the surrounding islands; but otherwise

the colours of the birds call for no special remark.

   In Timor and Flores we have white-headed pigeons f, and a long-tailed fly-

catcher almost entirely white \.

   In the small Lord' Howe's Island we have the recently extinct white rail

New(Nofurnis alba), remarkably contrasting with its allies in the larger islands of

Zealand.

  We cannot, however, lay any stress on isolated examples of white colour, since

these occur in most of the great continents ; but where we find a series of species

of distinct genera all diftering from their continental allies in a whiter coloration,

as in the Andaman Islands and the West Indies, and, among butterflies, in the
smaller Moluccas, the Andamans, and Madagascar, we cannot avoid the conclusion

that in these insular localities some general cause is at work.

   There are other cases, however, in which local influences seem to favour the
production or preservation of intense crimson or a very dark coloration. Thus in

the Moluccas and New Guinea alone we have bright red pari'ots belonging to two

distinct families §, and which therefore most probably have been independently

 roduced or preserved by some common cause. Here, too, and in Australia we

                                                                         ||
--in another insular subregion^that of Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands these

same colours reappear in the same two groups 51-
   Some very curious physiological facts bearing upon the presence or absence of

white colours in the higher animals have lately been adduced by Dr. Ogle **. It

has been found that a colonied or dark pigment in the olfactory region of the

nostrils is essential to perfect smell, and this pigment is rarely deficient except when

the whole animal is pure white. In these cases the creature is almost without

smell or taste. This, Dr. Ogle believes, explains the curious case of the pigs in

Virginia adduced by Mr. Darwin, white pigs being killed by a poisonous root

which does not aff'ect black pigs. Mr. Darwin imputed this to a constitutional
difference accompanying the dark colour, which rendered what was poisonous to

the white-coloured animals quite innocuous to the black. Dr. Ogle, however,

observes that there is no proof that the black pigs eat the root, and he believes the

more probable explanation to  be                                                that  it  is  distasteful                                                      to  them                              while  the white
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

pigs, being deficient in smell and taste, eat it and are killed. Analogous facts occur

in several distinct families. White sheep are killed in the Tarentino by eating

Ili/periciim crisimm, while black sheep escape ; white rhinoceroses are said to pei-ish

from eating Euphnrhia candelabrum; and white horses are said to suffer from

poisonous food where coloured ones escape. Now it is very improbable that a

constitutional immunity from poisoning by so many distinct plants should, in the

case of such widely different animals, be always correlated with the same differ-

ence of colour ; but the facts are readily understood if the senses of smell and

taste are dependent on the presence of a pigment which is deficient in wholly white

animals. The explanation has, however, been carried a step further, by experi-

ments showing that the absorption of odours by dead matter, such as clothing, is

greatly afiected by colour, black being the most powerful absorbent ; then blue, red,

Weyellow, and lastly white.   have here a physical cause for the sense-inferiority

of totally white animals which may account for their rarity in nature: for few,

if any, wild animals are wholly white : the head, the face, or at least the muzzle

or the nose, are generally black ; the ears and eyes are also often black ; and there
is reason to believe that dai-k pigment is essential to good hearing, as it certainly

We13 to perfect vision.                              can therefore understand why white cats with hlue ejes

are so often deaf, a peculiarity we notice more readily than their deficiency of smell

or taste.

If, then, the prevalence of white coloration is generally accompanied with some

deficiency in the acuteness of the most important senses, this colour becomes

doubly dangerous ; for it not only renders its possessor more conspicuous to its

enemies, but at the same time makes it less ready in detecting the presence of

danger. Hence, perhaps, the reason why white appears more frequently in islands,

where competition is less severe and enemies less numerous and varied. Hence, also,

a reason why albinoism, although freely occurring in captivity, never maintains

itself in a wild state, while melanism does. The peculiarity of some islands in

ha\ing all their inhabitants of dusky colours (as the Galapagos) may also perhaps

be explained on the same principles ; for poisonous fruits or seeds may there abound

which weed out all white- or light-coloured A'arieties, owing to their deficiency of

Wesmell and taste.                                   can hardly believe, however, that this would apply to white-

coloiu-ed butterflies ; and this may be a reason why the efl'ect of an insiilar habitat

is more marked in these insects than in birds or mammals. But though inappli-

cable to the lower animals, this cm-ious relation of sense-acuteuess with colours

may have had some influence on the development of the higher human races. If

light tints of the skin were generally accompanied by some deficiency in the senses

of smell, hearing and vision, the white could never compete with the darker races

so long as man was in a very low or savage condition, and wholly dependent for

existence ou tlie acuteness of his senses. But as the mental faculties became more

fully developed and more important to his welfare than mere sense-acuteness, the

lighter tints of skin and hair and eyes would cease to be disadvantageous whenever

they were accompanied by superior brain-power. Such variations would then be

preserved ; and thus may have arisen the Xanthochroic race of manliiud, in which
we find a high development of intellect accompanied by a slight deficiency in the

acuteness of the senses as compared with the darker forms.

   I have now to ask your attention to a few remarks en the peculiar relations of

plants and insects as exhibited in islands.

Ever since Mr. Darwin showed theimmense importance ofinsects in the fertilization

of flowers gi'eat attention has been paid to the subject, and the relation of these two

very diflerent classes of natural objects has been found to be more universal and

more complex than could have been anticipated. Whole genera and families of

plants have been so modified as first to attract, and then to be fertilized by, certain

groups of  insects                                   and this special adaptation  seems  in many cases to have deter-
                                                  ;

mined the more or less wide range of the plants in question. It is also known

that some species of plants can be fertilized only by particular species of insects

and the aksence of these from any locality would necessarily present the continued

existence of the plant in that area. Here, I believe, will be found the clue to

much of the peculiarity of the floras of oceanic islands, since the methods by which

these have been stocked with plants and insects Avill be often quite diflerent.

Many seeds are, no doubt, carried by oceanic currents, others probably by aquatic
birds. Mr. H. N. Moseley informs mo that the albatrosses, gnalls, puffins, tropic
birds, and many others nest inland, often amidst dense vegetation, and he believes

they often carry seeds, attached to their feathers, from island to island for great

distances. In the tropics they often nest on the mountains far inland, and may

thus aid in the distribution even of mountain-plants. Insects, on the other hand,

are mostly conveyed by aerial currents, especially by violent gales ; and it may
thus often happen that totally xmrelated plants and insects may be brought toge-

ther, in which case the former must often perish for want of suitable insects to

fertilize them. This will, I think, account for the sti'angely fragmentary nature of

these insular" floras, and the great differences that often exist between those which

are situated in the same ocean, as well as for the preponderance of certain orders

and genera. In Mr. Pickering's valuable work on the ' Geogi-aphical Distribution

of Animals and Plants,' he gives a list of no less than sixty-six natural orders of

plants vnexpedeiVy absent from Tahiti, or which occur in many of the surrounding

--lands, some being abundant in other islands as the I.abiataa at the Sandwich

Islands. la these latter islands the flora is much richer, yot a large number of

families whicli abound iu other parts of Polynesia are totally wantiug. Now much

of the poverty and exceptional distribution of the plants of these islands is pro-
Ijably duo to the great scarcity of flower-frequenting insects. Lepidoptera and
Ilvnieuoptera are exceedingly scarce iu the eastern islands of the Pacific, and it is

almost certain that many plants which require these insects for their fertilization

have been thereby prevented from establishing themselves. In the western islands,
such as the Fijis, several species of butterflies occur in tolerable abundance, and no
doubt some flower-haunting Ilymenoptera accompany them ; and in these islands

the flora appears to be much more varied, and especially to be characterized by a
much greater variety of sliowj' flowers, as may be seen by examining the plates of

Dr. Seemann's ' Flora Vitiensis.'
   Darwin and Pickering both speak of the great preponderance of ferns at Tahiti

and Mr. Moseley, who spent several days in the interior of the island, informs me

that " at an elevation of from 2000 to 3000 feet the dense vegetation is composed
almost entirely of ferns. A. tree fern (Alsophila tahitensis) forms a sort of forest to
the exclusion of almost every other tree, and, with huge plants of two other ferns
(Anr/iopteris cvecta and Aspelenium nidus), forms the main mass of the vegetation."

And he adds, " I have nowhere seen ferns in so gi-eat proportionate abundance."

This unusual proportion of lerns is a general feature of insular as compared with

continental floras ; but it has, I believe, been generally attributed to favourable

conditions, especially to equable climate and perennial moisture. In this respect,

however, Tahiti can hardly differ greatly from many other islands, -which yet have
no such vast preponderance of ferns. This is a question that cannot be decided by

mere lists of species, since it is probable that iu Tahiti they are less numerous than
in some other islands where they form a far less conspicuous feature in the vege-

--tation. The island most comparable -ndth Tahiti in that respect is Juan Fernandez.

Mr. Moseley writes to me : " In a general view of any wide stretch of the densely

clothed mountainous surface of the island, the ferns, both tree ferns and the un-
stenimed forms, are seen at once to compose a very large proportion of the mass of

foliage." As to the insects of Juan Fernandez, Mr. Edwyn C. Reed, who made
two visits and spent several weeks there, has kindly furnished me -with some exact

--information. Of butterflies there is only one {Piirameis carie), and that rare

Chilian species, and probably an accidental straggler. Four species of moths of
moderate size were observed (all Chilian), and a few larvae and pupje. Of bees
there were none, except one very minute species (allied to Chilicolu), and of other
Ilymenoptera a single specimen of Ophion htteus (a cosmopolitan ichneumon).
About twenty species of flies were observed, and these formed the most prominent

feature of the entomology of the island.

   Now, as far as we know, this extreme entomological poverty agrees closely with

that of Tahiti; and there are probably no other portions of the globe equally
favoured in soil and climate, and with an equally luxm-iant vegetation, where
insect-life is so scantily developed. It is curious, therefore, to find that these two

islands also agree in the wonderful predominance of ferns over the flowering plants

--in individuals even more than in species ; and there is uo difficulty in connecting

the two facts. The excessive minuteness and great abimdance of fem-spores causes
them to be far more easily distributed by winds than the seeds of flinvering plants,

and they are thus always ready to occupy any vacant places in suitable localities,
and to compete with the less vigorous flowering plants. But where insects are so
scarce, all' plants which require insect-fertilization, whether constantly to enable
them to produce seed at all, or occasionally to keep up their constitutional vigour
bv crossing, must be at a great disadvantage ; and thus the scanty flora which
oceanic islands must always possess, peopled as they usuall)' are by waifs and
strays from other lands, is rendered still more scanty by the weeding out of all

such as depend largely on insect-fertilization for their full development. It seems
probable, therefore, that the preponderance of ferns in islands (considered in mass
of individuals rather than in number of species) is largely due to the absence of
competing phsenogamous plants, and that this is in great part due to the scai-city

of in.sects. In other oceanic islands, such as New Zealand and the Galapagos,

where ferns, although tolerabh' abundant, form no such predominant feature in the

vegetation, but where the scarcity of flower-hauuting insects is almost equally
108. REPORT-- 1876.

marked, we find a great pieponderauce of small, green, or otherwise inconspicuous

flowers, indicating that inly such plants have been enabled to flourish there as are

independent of insect-fertilization. In the Galapagos (which are perhaps even

more deficient in flying insects than Juan Fernandez; this is so striking a feature

that Mr. Darwin speaks of the vegetation as consisting in great part of " wretched-

looking weeds,'" and states that " it was some time before he discovered that almost

every plant was in flower at the time of his visit." He also says that he " did not

see one beautiful flower " in the islands. It appears, however, that Compositte,

Leguminosse, Rubiacefe, and Solanaceae form a large proportion of the flowering

plants; and as these are orders which usually require insect-fertilization, we must

suppose, either that they have become moditied so as to be self-fertilized, or that

they are fertilized by the visits of the minute Diptera and Hymenoptera, which are

the only insects recorded from these islands.

   In Juan Fernandez, on the other hand, there is no such total deficiency of showy

flowers. I am informed by Mr. Mcjseley tliat a variety of the Magnoliaceous winter-

bark abounds and has showy white flowers, and that a Biguoniaceous shrub witli

abundance of dark blue flowers was also plentiful ; while a white-flowered Liliaceous

plant formed large patches on the hill-sides. Besides these there were two species
of woody Oompositse with conspicuous heads of yellow blossoms, and a species of

white-flowered myrtle also abundant ; so that, on the whole, flowers formed a rather

--conspicuous feature in the aspect of the vegetation of Juan Fernandez.
   But this fact which at flrst sight seems entirely at variance with the view we

--are upholding of the important relation between "the distribution of insects and

plants is well explained by the existence of two species of humming-birds in

Juan Fernandez, which, in their visits to these large and showj' flowers, fertilize

them as efl'ectually as bees, moths, or butterflies. Mr. Moseley informs me that

" these humming-birds are e.itraorilmarili/ abundant, every tree or bush having one

or two darting about it." He also observed that " nearly all the specimens killed

had the feathers round the base of the bill and front of the head clogged and

coloured yellow with pollen." Here, then, we have the clue to the perpetuation

of  large and showy flowers in Juan Fernandez                                                                                                                                                                                                          while  the  total  absence  of  hum-

ming-birds in the Galapagos may explain why no such large-flowered plants have

been able to establish themselves in those equatorial islands.

    This leads to the observation that many other gi-oups of birds also, no doubt, aid

in the fertilization of flowers. I have often observed the beaks and faces of the

brush-tongued lories of  the  Moluccas covered with pollen                                                                                                                                                                                                         and Mr. Moseley noted
                                                                                                                                                                         ;

the same fact in a species of Artamus, or swallow-shrike, shot at Cape York, show-

ing that this genus also frequents flowers and aids in their fertilization. In the

Australian region we have the immense group of the Meliphagidte, which all

frequent flowers; and as these range over all the islands of the Pacific, their presence

will account for a certain proportion of showy flowers being found there, such as

the scarlet Metrosideros, one of the few conspicuous flowers in Tahiti. In the

Sandwich Islands, too, there are forests of 3fetrosideros ; and Mr. Charles Pickering
writes me, that they are visited by honey-sucking birds, one of which is captured

by sweetened bird-lime, against which it thrusts its extensile tongue. I am also

informed that a considerable number of flowers are occasionally fertilized by hum-

ming-birds in North America                                                                                                                                           so that there can, I think, be little doubt that birda
                                                                                                                                                                   ;

play a much more important part in this respect than has hitherto been imagined.

It is not improbable that in Tropical America, where the humming-bird family is

so enormously developed, many flowers will be found to be expressly adapted to

fertilization by them, just as so many in our own coimtry are specially adapted

to the visits of certain fomilies or genera of insects.

   It must also be remembered, as Mr. Moseley has suggested to me, that a flower
which had acquired a brilliant colour to attract insects might, on transference to

another country, and becoming so modified as to be capable of self-fertilization,

retain the coloured petals for an indefinite period. Such is probably the explana-

tion of the Pe/arr/oniiim of Tristan d'Acunha, which forms masses of blight colour

near the shore during the flowering season; while most of the other plants of the

island have colourless flowers, in accordance with the almost total absence of winged

instcts. The presence of many large and showy flowers among the indigenous

flora of St. Helena must be an example of a similar persistence. Mr. Mellisa

indeed states it to be " a remarkable peculiarity that the indigenous flowers are,

with very slight exceptions, all perfectly colourless ; "* but although this may apply

to the general aspect of the remains of the indigenous flora, it is evidently not the

case as regards the species, since the interesting plates of Mr. Melliss's volume show
that about one third of the indigenous flowering plants have more or less coloured
or conspicuous flowers, while several of them are exceedingly showy and beautiful.
Among these are a Lobelia, three Wahlenben/ias, several C'omposiUe, and especially
the handsome red flowers of the now almost extinct forest-trees, the ebony and
Weredwood (species of Melhania, Byttneriaceas).
                                                        have every reason to believe,

however, that when St. Helena was covered with luxuriant forests, and especially
at that remote period when it was much more extensive than it is now, it must
have supported a certain number of indigenous birds and insects, which would have
aided iu the fertilization of these gaily-coloured flowers. The researches of Dr._
Hermann Miiller have shown us by what minute modifications of structure or of

fimction many flowers are adapted for partial insect- andself-feitilization in various

de^^rees ; so that we have no difficulty in understanding how, as the insects diminished

and finally disappeared, self-fertilization may have become the rule, while the large

and showy corollas remain to tell us plainly of a once different state of things.
Another interesting fact in connexion with this subject is the presence of arbo-
rescent forms of Compcsitffi in so many of the remotest oceanic islands. They
occur in the Galapngos, in Juan Fernandez, in St. Helena, in the Sandwich Islands,

and in New Zealand ; but they arenotdiiectly related to each other, representatives
of totally different tribes of this extensive order becoming arborescent in each
group of islands. The iinmen.se range and almost universal distribution of the

Compositte is due to the combination of a great facility of distribution (by their

seeds) with a gieat attractiveness to insects, and the capacity of being fertihzedby
a variety of species of all orders, and especially by flies and small beetles. Thus
they would be among the earliest of flowering plants to establish themselves on
oceanic islands ; but where insects of all kinds were very scarce it would be an

advantage to gain increased size and longevity, so that fertilization at an interval

of several years might suffice for the continuance of the species. The arborescent

mform would combine with increased longevity the advantage of increased size

the struggle for existence with ferns and other early colonists; and these advantages

have led to its being independently produced in so many distant localities, whose
chief feature in common is their remoteness from continents and the extreme

poverty of their insect life.  flowers  are  known  to  act in combination  wi·th,                 ·

   As the sweet odours of                                                           tih.eir

colours, as an attraction to insects, it might be anticipated that where colour was

deficient scent would be so also. On applying to my friend Dr. Hooker for infor-

mation as to New-Zealand plants, he informed me that this was certainly the case,

and that the New-Zealand flora is, speaking generally, as strikingly deficient in

sweet odours as in conspicuous colours. Whether this peculiarity occurs in other
islands, I have not been able to obtain information ; but we may certainly expect

it to be so in such a marked instance as that of the Galapagos flora.

   Another question which here comes before us is the origin and meaning of the

odoriferous glands of leaves. Dr. Hooker informed me that not only are New-

Zealand plants deficient in scented flowers, but equally so in scented leaves. This

--led me to think that perhaps such leaves were in some way an additional attrac-

tion to insects though it is not easy to understand how this could be, except by
adding a general attraction to the special attraction of the flowers, or by supporting

the larvaj which, as perfect insects, aid in fertilization. Mr. Darwin, however,

informs me that he considers that leaf-glands bearing essential oils are a protection

against the attacks of insects where these abound, and would thus not be required

in countries where insects were very scarce. But it seems opposed to this view

that highly aromatic plants are characteristic of deserts all over the world, and in
such places insects are not abundant. Mr. Stainton informs me that the aromatic

Labiatte enjoy no immunity from insect attacks. The bitter leaves of the cherry-

laurel are often eaten by the larvae of moths that abound on our fnii1/-trees ; while

in the Tropics the leaves of the orange tribe are favoui^tes with a large number of

lepidopterous larvae ; and our northern firs and pines, althougli abounding in a

Myhighly aromatic resin, are very subject to the attacks of beetles.  friend Dr.
--Richard Spruce who while travelling in South America allowed nothing connected
--with plant-life to escape his observation informs me that trees wliose leaves have

aromatic and often resinous secretions in immersed glands abound in the plains of

tropical America, and that such are in great part, if not wholly, free from the
attacks of leaf-eating ants, except where the secretion is only slightly bitter, as in
the orange tribe, orange-trees being sometimes entirel)' denuded of their leaves in
a single night. Aromatic plants abound in the Andes up to about 13,000 feet, as
well as in the plains, but hardly more so than in Central and Southern Europe.

They are perhaps more plentiful in the dry mountainous parts of Southern

Europe and as neither here nor in the Andes do leaf-eating ants exist. Dr. Sjiruce
                                           ;

infers that, although in the hot American forests where such ants swarm the oil-

bearing glands serve as a protection, yet they were not originally acquired for that
purpose. Near the limits of perpetual snow on the Andes such plants as occur

are not, so far as Dr. Spruce has observed, aromatic ; and as plants in such situa-

tions can hardly depend on insect visits for their fertilization, the fact is com-

parable -with, that of the flora of New Zealand, and would seem to imply some

relntion between the two phenomena, though Avhat it exactly is cannot yet be

determined.

   I trust I have now been able to show you that there are a number of curious

problems lying as it were on the outskirts of biological inquiry which well merit

attention, and which may lead to valuable results. But these problems are, as

you see, for the most part connected with questions of locality, and require full
and accurate knowledge of the productions of a number of small islands and other

limited areas, and the means of comparing them the one with the other. To
make such comparisons, however, is now quite impossible. No museum contains

any f^vir representations of the productions of these localities ; and such specimens

as do exist, being scattered through the general collection, are almost useless for

this special purpose. If, then, we are to make any progress in this inquiry, it is

absolutely essential that some collectors should begin to arrange their cabinets

primarily on a geographical basis, keeping together the productions of every island

or group of islands, and of such divisions of each continent as are found to possess
Weany special or characteristic fauna or flora.

      Mise and Progress of Modern Views as to the Aiittquity and Origin of JIan.

   I now come to a branch of our subieot which I would gladly have a\oided

touching on ; but as the higher powers of tliis Association have decreed that I should
preside over the Anthropological Department, it seems proper that I should devote

some portion of my address to matters more immediately connected with the

special study to which that Department is devoted.

  As my own Imowledge of and interest in Anthropology is confined to the great

outlines rather than to the special details of the science, I propose to give a very
brief and general sketch of the modern doctrine as to the Antiquity and Origin of
Man, and to suggest certain points of difficulty which have not, I think, yet re-

ceived sufficient attention.

   Many now present remember the time (for it is little more than twenty years
ago) when the antiquity of man, as now understood, was imiversally discredited.
Not only theologians, but even geologists, then tauglit us that man belonged alto-

gether to the existing state of things ; that the extinct animals of tlie Tertiary
period had finally disappeared, and that the earth's surface had assumed its present

condition before the human race fii'st came into existence. So prepossessed were

--even scientific men with this idea which yet rested on purely negative evidence,
--and covild not he supported by any arguments of scientific value that numerous

facts which had been presented at intervals for half a century, all tending to prove

the existence of man at very remote epochs, were silently ignored ; and, more than

this, the detailed statements of three distinct and careful observers coniirming each

other were rejected by a great scientific Society as too improbable for publication,

only because' they proved (if they were true) the coexistence of man with extinct

animals *.

But this state of belief in opposition to facts could not long continue. In 1851)

a few of our most eminent geologists examined for tliemselves into the alleged
occuiTence of flint implements in the gravels of the north of France, which had
been made public fourteen years before, and found them strictly correct. The

caverns of Devonshire were about the same time carefidly examined by equally

eminent observers, and were found fully to be.ar out the statements of those who

had published their results eighteen years before. Flint implements began to be
foimd in all suitable localities in the south of England, when carefully searched

for, often in gravels of equal antiquity with those of France. Caverns giving

evidence of human occupation at vaiious remote periods were explored in Belgium

--and the south of France ^lake-dwellings were examined in Switzerland refuse-
--heaps in Denmark and thus a whole series of remains have been discovered

carrying back the history of mankind from the earliest historic periods to a long

distant past. The antiquity of the races thus discovered can only be generally

determined by the successively earlier and earlier stages through which we can

trace them. As we go back metals soon disappear, and we find onlj' tools and

weapons of stone and of bone.  The stone weapons get ruder and ruder pottery,
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

and then the bone implements, cease to occur ; and in the earliest stage we find

only chipped fiints of rude design, though still of unmistakably human workman-

ship. In like manner domestic animals disappear as we go backward ; and though

the dog seems to have been the earliest, it is doubtful whether the makers of the

ruder flint implements of the gravels posses.sed even this. Still more important

as a measure of time are the changes of the earth's surface, of the distribution of

animals, and of climate which have occur-ed during the human period. At a

comparatively recent epoch in the record of prehistoric times we find that the

Baltic was far Salter than it is now and produced abundance of oysters, and that

Denmark was covered with pine forests inhabited by Capercailzies, such as now
Aonly occur further north in Norway.
                                      little earlier we find that reindeer were

common even in the south of France ; and still earlier this animal was accom-

panied by the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, b)^ the arctic glutton, and by huge

bears and lions of extinct species. The presence of such animals implies a change

of climate ; and both in the caves and gravels we find proofs of a much colder

climate than now prevails in Western Europe. Still more remaa-kable are the

changes of the earth's surface which have been effected during man's occupation of

it. Many extensive valleys in England and France are believed by the best ob-
servers to have been deepened at least a hundred feet ; caverns now far out of

the reach of any stream must for a long succession of years have had streams

flowing through them, at least in times of floods ; and this often implies that vast

masses of solid rock have since been worn away. In Sardinia land has risen at
least 300 feet since men lived there wlio made pottery and probably used fishing-

nets t ; while in Kent's Cavern remains of man are found buried beneath two

separate beds of stalagmite, each having a distinct texture, and each covering a

deposit of cave-earth havmg well-marked differential characters, while each con-

tains a distinct assemblage of extinct animals.

Such, briefly, are the results of the evidence that has been rapidly accumulating

for about fifteen years as to  the antiquity of man                                                                                                  and it has  been confirmed by so

comparisou of the tools and weapons of prehistoric man with those of modern

savages (so that the use of even the rudest flint-implements has become quite
intelligible), that we can hardly wonder at the vast revolution effected in public
opinion. Not only is the belief in man's vast and still unknown antiquity uni-

versal among men of science, but it is hardly disputed by any well-informed
tlieologian ; and the present generation of science-students must, we should think,
be somewhat puzzled to understand what there was in the earliest discoveries that

should have aroused such general opposition and been met with such universal

incredulity.

  But the question of the mere "Antiquity of Man" almost sank into insigni-

ficance at a very early period of the inquiry, in comparison with the far more

momentous and more exciting problem of the development of man from some

lower animal form, which the theories of Mr. Darwin and of Mr. Herbert Spencer

soon showed to be inseparably bound up with it. This has been, and to some ex-

tent still is, the subject of fierce conflict ; but the controversy as to the fact of such

development is now almost at an end, since one of the most talented representatives

-- --of Catholic theology, and an anatomist of high standing Professor Jlivart fully

adopts it as regards physical structure, reserving his opposition for those parts of

the theory which would deduce man's whole intellectual and moral nature from
the same source and by a similar mode of development.

   Never, perhaps, in the whole history of science or philosophy has so great a
revolution in thought and opinion been effected as in the twelve years from 1859

to 1871, the respective dates of publication of Mr. Darwin's ' Origin of Species

and ' Descent of Man.' Up to the commencement of this period the belief in the

independent creation or origin of the species of animals and plants, and the very

recent appearance of man upon the earth, were, practically, universal. liOng

before the end of it these two beliefs had utterly disappeared, not only
in the scientific world, but almost equally so among the literary and educated

classes generally. The belief in the independent origin of man held its ground
somewhat longer; but the publication of Mr. Darwin's great work gave even that
its death-blow, for hardly any one capable of judging of the evidence now doubts
the derivative nature of man's bodily structure as a whole, although many believe
that his mind, and even some of his physical characteristics, may be due to the

action of other forces than have acted in the case of the lower animals.

  We need hardly be surpri.'ied, under these circumstances, if there has been a

tendency among men of science to ] ass from one extreme to the other, from a pro-

fession (so few years ago) of total ignorance as to the mode of oiigin of all living

things, to a claim to almost complete knowledge of the wlu le progress of the

universe, from the first speck of living protoplasm up to the highest development

of the human intellect. Yet this is really what we have seen in the 1 ist sixteen

years. Formerly difliculties were exaggerated, and it was asserted that we had

not sufficient knowledge to venture on any generalizations on the subject. Now

difficulties are set aside, and it is held that our theories are so well established and

80 i'ar-rer.ching, that they explain and comprehend all nature. It is not long ago
(as I have already reminded you) since /ffc-fo were contemptuously ignored, because

they favoured our now popular views; at the present day it seems to me that facts
which oppose them hardly receive due consideration. And as opposition is the

best incentive to progress, and it is not well even for the best theories to have it

all their own way, I propose to direct your attention to a few such facts, and to
the conclusions that seem fairly deducible from them.

It is a curious circumstance that notwithstanding the attention that has been

directed to the subject in every part of world, and the niuuerous excavations con-

nected with railways and mines which have offered such facilities for geological

discovery, no advance whatever has been made for a considerable number of years

in detecting the time or mode of man's origin. The Paleolithic flint weapons

first discovered in the North of France more than thirty years ago are still the

oldest undisputed proofs of man's  existence                                              and  amid  the  countless  relics of  a

value; and this is, no doubt,' generally the case. The circumstances here are,
however, peculiar, for many couvergiug lines of evidence show that, on the theory

of development by the same laws which have determined the development of the

lower animals, man must be immensely older than any traces of him yet dis-
covered. As this is a point of great interest we must devote a few moments to its

consideration.

1. The most import tut difference between mau and such of the lower animals as

most nearly approach him is undoubtedly in the bulk and development of his

Webrain, as indicated by tlie form and capacity of the cranium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             should therefore

anticipate that these earliest races, who were contemporary with the extinct ani-

mals and used rude stone weapons, would show a jnarked deficiency in this

respect. Yet the oldest known crania (those of the Eugis and Cro-Magiion caves)

show no marks of degradation. The former does not present so low a type as

that of most existing savages, but is (to use the words of Prof. Huxley) " a fair

average human skull, which might have belonged to a philosopher, or might have

contained the thoughtless brains of a savage." The latter are still more remark-

able, being unusually large and well formed. Dr. Pruner-Bey states that they
surpass the average of modern European skulls in capacity, while their symmetrical

form without any trace of prognathism, compares favourably not only with those

of the foremost savage races, but with many civilized nations' of modern times.
   One or two other crania of much lower type, but of less antiquity than this, have

been discovered ; but they in no way invalidate the conclusion which so highly

developed a form at so early a period implies, viz. that we ha\ e as yet made a

hardly perceptible step towai-ds the discovery of any earlier stage in the develop-
ment of man.

2. This conclusion is supported and enforced by the natiu-e of many of tlie works

of art found even in the oldest cave-dwellings. The flints are of the old chipped

--type, but they are formed into a large variety of tools and weapons such as

scrapers, awls, hammers, saws, lances, &c., implying a variety of purposes for

which these were used, and a corresponding degTee of mental activity and civilization.
Numerous articles of bone have also been found, including well-formed needles,

implying that skins were sewn together, and perhaps even textile materials woven
into cloth. Still more important are the numerous carvings and drawings repre-

senting a variety of aninuils, including horses, reindeer, and even a mammoth,

executed with considerable skill on bone, i-eindeer-horns, and mammotli-tusks.

These, taken together, indicate a state of civilization much higher than that of the
lowest of our modern savages, while it is quite compatible with a considerable de-

gree of mental advancement, and leads us to believe that the crania of Engis and
Cro-Magnon are not exceptional, but fairly represent the characteis of the race. If

we further remember that these people lived in Europe under the unfavourible
conditions of a sub-Arctic climate, we shall be inclined to agree with Dr. Daniel

Wilson, that it is far easier to produce evidences of deterioration than of progress

in instituting a comparison between the contemporaries of the mammoth and latpr

prehistoric races of Europe or savage nations of modern times*.

   ·3. Yet another important line of evidence as to the extreme antiquitv of the

human type has been brought prominently forward by Prof Mivartf. He shows,
by a careful comparison of all parts of the structure of "the body, that man is related

--not to any one, but almost equally to many of the existing apes to the orang, the
--chimpanzee, the gorilla, and even to the gibbons in a variety of ways ; and tiiese

relations and differences are so numerous and so diverse that, "on the theory of evo-

lution, the ancestral form which ultimately developed into man must have 'diverged
from the common stock whence all these various forms and their extinct allies ori-

ginated. But so far back as the Miocene deposits of Europe we fi)id the remains

of apes allied to these various forms, and especially to the gibbons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        so  that  in  all
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

probability the special line of variation which led up to njan branched off at a still

earlier period. And these early forms, being the initiation of a far higher type,

and ha\ing to develop by natural selection into so specialized and altogether distinct

a creature as man, must have risen at a very early period into the position of a

* rroliistoric Man, 3rd ed. vnl. i. p. 117.  t Man and Apes, pp. 171-UI3.

--dominaut race, and spread in dense waves of population over all suitable portions of

the great continent for this, on Mr. Darwin's hypothesis, is essential to rapid de-

velopmental progress through the agency of natural selection.

   Under these circumstances we might certainl}^ expect to find some relics of these
earlier forms of man along with those of animals, which were presumably less

abundant. Negative evidence of this kind is not ver_v weighty, but still it has

some value. It has been suggested that as apes are mostly tropical, and anthropoid

apes are now confined almost exclusively to the vicinity of the equator, we should

expect the ancestral forms also to have inhabited these same localities--^^'^est Africa

and the Malay Islands. But this objection is hardly valid, because existing anthro-

poid apes are wholly dependent on a perennial supply of easily accessible fniits,

%vhich is only found near the equator, while not only had the south of Europe an

almost tropical climate in Miocene times, but we must suppose even the earliest
ancestors of man to have been ten-estrial and omnivorous, since it must have taken

ages of slow modification to have produced the perfectly erect form, the short arms,

and the wholly non-prehensile foot, which so strongly differentiate man from

the arboreal apes.

   The conclusion which I think we must arrive at is, that if man has been deve-
loped from a common ancestor, with all existing apes, and hy no other agencies than

such as have affected their development, then he must have existed, in something ap-

--proaching his present form, during the tertiary period and not merely existed,

but predominated in numbers, wherever suitable conditions prevailed. If, then,

contmued researches in all parts of Europe and Asia fail to bring to light any

proofs of his presence, it will be at least a presumption that he came into existence
at a much later date, and by a much more rapid process of development. In that

case it will be a fixir argument that, just as he is in his mental and moral nature,

his capacities and aspii-ations, so infinitely raised above the brutes, so his origin

is due, in part, to distinct and higher agencies than such as have affected their

development.

   There is yet another line of inquii-y bearing upon this subject to which I wish to
call yoiu: attention. It is a somewhat curious fact that, while all modern writers

admit the great antiquity of man, most of them maintain the verv recent develop-
ment of his intellect, and will hardly contemplate the possibility of men equal in

mental capacity to ourselves having existed in prehistoric times. This question is

generally assumed to be settled by such relics as have been preserved of the manu-

factures of the older races showing a lower and lower state of the arts, by the

successive disappearance in early times of iron, bronze, and pottery, and by the
ruder forms of the older flint implements. The weakness of this argument has
been well shown by Mr. Albert Mott in his very original but little-lmowu pre-

sidential address to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool in 1873.

He maintains that "om* most distant glimpses of the past are still of a world
peopled as now with men both civilized and savage,'' and "that we have often

entirely misread the past by supposing that the outward signs of civilization must

always be the same, and must be such as are found among om-selves." In support

of this view he adduces a variety of strilring facts and ingenious arguments, a few

of which I will briefly summarize.

 -- --On one of the most remote islands of the Pacific Easter Island 2O0O miles

from South America, 2000 from the Marquesas, and more than 1000 from the

Gambler Islands, are found hundreds of gigantic stone images, now mostly in

ruins, often thirty or forty feet high, while some seem to have been nuich larger,

the crowns on their heads cut out of a red stone being sometimes ten feet in dia-

meter, while even the head and neck of one is said to have been twenty feet high *.

These once stood erect on extensive stone platforms; j'et the island has onlv an area

Nowof about thirty square miles, or considerably less than Jersey.                                                                                                          as one of the

smallest images eight feet high weighs four tons, the largest must weigh over a

hundred  tons, if not much more                                                                                                             and the existence of such vast  works  implies  a
                                                                                                                                         ;

could tliese coexist in a mere speck of land wholly cut off from the rest of the

World ? Mr. Mott maintains that this necessarily implies the power of regular

conimunicaiion s^^tll larger islands or a continent, the arts of navigation, and a

civilization much higher than now exists in any part of the racific. Very similar

remains in other islands scattered widely over the Pacific add weight to this argu-

ment.

The next example is that of the ancient mounds and earthworks of the North-

American continent, the bearing of which is even more significant. Over the

greater part of the extensive Mississippi vallej^ four well-marked classes of these

earthworks occur. Some are camps, or works of defence, situated on bluffs, pro-

montories, or isolated hills ; others are vast enclosures in the plains and lowlands,

often of geometric forms, and having attached to them roadways or avenues often

miles in length ; a third are mounds con-esponding to our tumuli, often seventy to
ninety feet high, and some of them covering acres of ground ; while a fourth group
consist of representations of various animals modelled in relief on a gigantic scale,

and occurring chiefly in an area somewhat to the north-west of the other classes, in

the plains of Wisconsin.

 -- --The first class the camps or fortified enclosures resemble in general features

the ancient camps of our own islands, but far surpass them in extent. Fort Hill,

in Ohio, is surrounded by a wall and ditch a mile and a half in length, part of the
way cut through solid rock. Artificial reservoirs for water were made within it,

while at one extremity, on a more elevated point, a keep is constructed with its
separate defences and water-reservoirs. Another, called Clark's Work, in the

Scioto valley, which seems to have been a fortified town, encloses an area of 127

acres, the embankments measuring three miles in length, and containing not less

than three million cubic feet of earth. This area encloses numerous sacrificial
moimds and symmetrical earthworks, in which many interesting relics and works

of art have been found.

 -- --The second class the sacred enclosures may be compared for extent and ar-

rangement with Avebury or Carnak, but are in some respects even more remark-

able. One of these at Newark, Ohio, covers an area of several miles with its

connected groups of circles, octagons, squares, ellipses, and avenues on a grand

scale, and formed by embankments from twenty to thirty feet in height. Other

similar works occur in different pai-ts of Ohio ; and hj accurate survey it is found
not only that the circles are true, though some of them are one third of a mile in

diameter, but that other figures are truly square, each side being over 1000 feet

long, and, what is still more important, the dimensions of some of these geometrical

figures, in different parts of the country and seventy miles apart, are identical.

Now this proves the use, by the builders of these woi-ks, of some standard mea-

sures of length, while the accuracy of the squares, circles, and, in a less degree, of

the octagonal figures shows a considerable knowledge of rudimentary geometry

and some means of measuring angles. The difficulty of drawing such figures on a

large scale is much greater than any one would imagine who has not tried it, and

Wethe accuracy of these is far beyond what is necessary to satisfy the eye.  must

therefore impute to these people the wish to make these figures as accurate as

possible ; and this wish is a greater proof of habitual skill and intellectual advance-

ment than even the ability to draw such figures. If, then, we take into account

this ability and this love of geometric truth, and further consider the dense popu-

lation and civil organization implied by the construction of such extensive syste-
matic works, we must allow that these ancient people had reached the earlier stages

of a civilization of which no traces existed among the savage tribes who alone

occupied the covmtry when first visited by Europeans.

The animal mounds are of comparatively less importance for our present pur-

pose, as they imply a somewhat lower grade of advancement; but the sepulchral
and sacrificial mounds exist in vast numbers, and their partial exploration has

yielded a quantity of articles and works of art which throw some further light on

the peculiarities of this mysterious people. Most of these moimds contain a large

concave hearth or basin of burnt clay, of perfectly symmetrical form, on which are

found deposited more or less abundant relics, all bearing traces of the action of

Wefire.  are therefore only acquainted with such articles as are practically fire-

proof, or have accidentally escaped combustion. These consist of bone and copper

--implements and ornaments, disks, and tubes pearl, shell, and silver Leads, mora

or less inj ured by the tire--ornaments cut in mica, ornamental pottery, and numbers

of elaborate carvings in stone, mostly forming pipes for smoking. The metallic

articles are all formed by hammering, but the execution is very good ; plates of

mica are found cut into scrolls and circles ; the pottery, of which ver\' few remains
have been found, is far superior to that of any of the Indian tribes, since Dr. Wilson

is of opinion that it must have been formed on a wheel, as it is often of uniform

thickness throughout (sometimes not more than one sixth of an inch), polished,

and ornamented with scrolls and figures of birds and flowers in delicate relief.

But the most instructive objects are the sculptured stone pipes, representing not

only various easily recognizable animals, but also human heads, so well executed
that they appear to be portraits. Among the animals, not only are such native

forms as the panther, bear, otter, wolf, beaver, raccoon, heron, crow, turtle, frog,

rattlesnake, and many others well represented, but also the manatee, which perhaps

then ascended the Mississippi as it now does the Amazon, and the toucan, which

could hardly have been obtained nearer than Mexico. The sculptured heads

are especially remarkable, because they present to us the features of an intellectual

and civilized people. The nose in some is perfectly straight, and neither promi-

nent nor dilated ; the mouth is small, and the lips                                     thin the chin and            upper lip are
                                                                                                                  ;

short, contrasting with the ponderous jaw of the modern Indian, wJiile the

cheek-bones present no marked prominence. Other examples have the nose

somewhat projecting at the apex in a manner quite unlike the features of any

American indigenes ; and although there are some which show a much coarser

face, it is very difficult to see in any of them that close resemblance to the

Indian type which these sculptures have been said to exhibit. The few authentic

crania from the mounds present corresponding features, being far more symmetrical

and better developed in the frontal region than those of any American tribes,

although somewhat resembling them in the occipital outline*; while one was

described by its discoverer (Mr. ^\^ Marshall Anderson) as a "beautiful skull

worthy of a Greek."

   The antiquity of this remarkable race may perhaps not be very great as com-
pared with the prehistoric man of Europe, although the opinions of some writers

on the subject seem affected by that " parsimony of time " on which the late Sir

Charles Lyell so often dilated. The mounds are all overgrown with dense forest,

and one of the large trees was estimated to be eight hundred years old, while other

observers consider the forest growth to indicate an age of at least 1000 years. But

it is well known that it requires several generations of trees to pass away before

the growth on a deserted clearing comes to correspond with that of the surrounding

virgin forest, while this forest, once established, may go on growing for an unknown

number of thousands of years. The 800 or 1030 years estimate from the growth

of existing vegetation is a minimum which has no bearing whatever on the actual

age of these mounds ; and we might almost as well attempt to determine the time
of the glacial epoch from the age of the pines or oaks which now grow on the

moraines.

The important thing for ns, however, is that when North America was first

settled by Europeans, the Indian tribes inhabiting it had no knowledge or tradition

of any preceding race of higher civilization than themselves. Yet we find that

such a race existed ; that they must have been populous and have lived under some
established government; while there are signs that they practised agriculture

largely, as, indeed, they must have done to have supported a population capable of

executing such gigantic works in such vast profusion ; for it is stated that the
mounds and earthworks of various kiuds in the state of Ohio alone amount to

between eleven and twelve thousand. In their habits, customs, religion, and arts

they  differed  strikingly  from  all  the  Indian  tribes                              wliile  their love of        art and  of
                                                                                     ;

geometric foims, and their capacity for executing the latter upon so gigantic a

scale, render it probable that they were a really civilized people, although the

form their civilization took may have been very different from that of later people

subject to very different influences, and the inheritors of a longer series of ancestral

Wecivilizations.  have lieio, at all events, a strikiug example of the trausilion,

over au extensive country, from comparative civilization to comparative barbarism,

--tbe former left to tradition and Laving hardly any trace of influence on the latter.
   As Mr. Mott well remarks : Nothing can be more striking than the fact that

Easter Island and North America both gave the same testimony as to the origin of

the savage life found in them, although in all circumstances and surroimdings the

two cases are so different. If no stone monuments had been constructed in Easter

Island, or mounds, containing a few relics saved from tire, in the United States,

we might never have suspected the existence of these ancient people.«. He argues,

therefore, that it is very easy for the records of an ancient nation's life entirely to

perish or to be hidden from observation. Even the arts of Nineveh and Babylon
were unknown only a generation ago, and we have only just discovered the facts
about the mound-builders of North America.

   But other parts of the American continent exhibit parallel phenomena. Recent
investigations show that in Mexico, Central America, and Peru the existing race
of Indians has been preceded by a distinct and more civilized race. This is proved
by the sculptures of the ruined cities of Central America, by the more ancient
terra-cottas and paintings of Mexico, and by the oldest portrait-pottery of Peru.

All alike show markedly non-Indian features, while they often closel}' resemble
modern European types. Ancient crania, too, have been found in all these countries,
presenting very different characters from those of any of the modern indigenous

races of America *.
   There is one other striking example of a higher being succeeded by a lower

degree of knowledge, which is in danger of being forgotten because it has been
made the foundation of theories which seem wild and fantastic, and are probably
in great part erroneous. I allude to the CTreat Pyramid of Egypt, whose form,

dimensions, structure, and uses have recently been tlie subject of elaborate works

by Prof Piazzi Smyth. Now the admitted facts about this pyramid are so inter-

esting and so apposite to the subject we are considering, that I beg to recall them

to your attention. 3Iost of you are aware that this pyramid has been carefLiUy
explored and measured by successive Egyptologists, and that the dimensions have
lately become capable of more accurate determination, owing to the discovery of
some of the original casing-stones and the clearing away of the earth from the
corners of the foundation showing the sockets in which the corner-stones fitted.

Prof Smyth devoted many months of work with the best instruments in order to

fix the dimensions and angles of all accessible parts of the struetm-e ; and he has

carefully determined these by a comparison of his own and all previous measures,
the best of which agree pretty closely with each other. The results arrived at

are :

   1. That the pyramid is truly square, the sides being equal and the angles right

angles.

   2. That the four sockets on which the four iirst stones cf the corners rested are

truly on the tame level.

   3. That the direction of the sides are accurately to the four cardinal points.
   4. That the vertical height of the pyramid bears the same proportion to its cir-

cumference at the base, as the radius of a circle does to its circumference.

  Now all these measures, angles, and levels are accurate, not as an ordinary sur-

veyor or builder could make them, but to such a degree as requires the very best
modern instruments and all the refinements of geodeticnl science to discover any
error at all. In addition to this we have the wonderful perfection of the workman-
ship in the interior of the pyramid, the passages and chambers being lined with
huge blocks of stones fitted with the utmost accuracy, while every part of the

building exhibits the highest structural science.

   In all these respects this largest pyramid surpasses every other in Egypt. Yet
it is universally admitted to be the oldest, and also the oldest historical building

in the world.

  Now these admitted facts about the Great Pyramid are surely remarkable, and

worthy of the deepest consideration. They are fiicts which, in the pregnant

words of the late Sir Jolin Herschel, " according to received tlieories ought uot to
happen," and which, he tells us, should therefore be kept ever present to our minds,

since "they belong to the class of facts which serve as the clue to new discoveries."
According to modern theories, the higher civilization is ever a growth and an out-
come from a preceding lower state ; and it is inferred that this progress is visible to us
throughout all history and in all the material records of human intellect. But here
we have a building which marks the very dawn of history, which is the oldest
authentic monument of man's genius and skill, and which, instead of being far in-
ferior, is very much superior to all which followed it. Great men are the products
of their age and country, and the designer and constructors of this wonderful monu-
ment could never have arisen among an uuintellectual and half-barbarous people.
So perfect a work implies many preceding less perfect works which have disappeared.

It marks the culminating point of an ancient civilization, of the early stages of

which we have no record whatever.
   The three cases to which I have now adverted (and there are many others) seem

to require for their satisfactory interpretation a somewhat different view of human
progress from that which is now generally accepted. Taken in connexion with the

--great intellectual power of the ancient Greeks which Mr. Galton believes to have
--been far above that of the average of any modern nation and the elevation, at

once intellectual and moral, displayed in the writings of Confucius, Zoroaster, and

in the Vedas, they point to the conclusion that, while in material progress there has

been a tolerably steadj^ advance, man's intellectual and moral development reached
almost its highest level in a very remote past. The lower, the more animal, but
often the more energetic types have, however, always been far the more numerous

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

hence such established societies as have here and there arisen under the guidance
of higher minds have always been liable to be swept away by the incursions of

barbarians. Thus in almost eveiy part of the globe there may have been a long-

succession of partial civilizations, each in turn succeeded by a period of barbarism
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and this view seems supported by the occurrence of degTaded types of skull along

with such " as might have belonged to a pliilosopher," at a time when the mam-

ground among geologists that palreolitliic man was really preglacial, and that the

great gap (marked alike by a change of physical conditions and of animal life)
whicli in Europe always separates him from his neolithic successor, was caused by
the coming on and passing away of the great ice age.

   If the views now advanced are coiTect, many, perhaps most, of our existing savages

are the successors of higher races ; and their arts, often showing a wonderful

similarity in distant continents, may have been derived from a common source
among more civilized peoples.

   I must now conclude this very imperfect sketch of a few of the offshoots from
the great tree of Biological study. It will, perhaps, be thought by some that my

remarks liave tended to the depreciation of our science, b}' hinting at imperfections
in our knowledge and errors in our theories where more enthusiastic students see

nothing but established truths. But I trust that I may have conveyed to many of
my heai'ers a different impression. I have endeavoured to show that, even in what

 are usually considered the more tiivial and superficial characters presented by natural
 objects, a whole field of new inquiry is opened up to us by the study of distribution

 and local conditions. And as regards man, I have endeavoured to fix your attention

 on a class of facts wliicli indicate that the course of his development has been far less
 dii'ect and simple than has hitherto been supposed ; and that, instead of resembling
 a single tide with its advancing and receding ripples, it must rather be compared
 to the progress from neap to spring tides, both the rise and the depression being

 comparatively greater as the waters of true civilization slowly advance towards the
 highest level they can reach.

    And if we are thus led to believe that our present knowledge of nature is some-
 what less complete than we have been accustomed to consider it, this is only what
 wo might expect ; for however great may have been the intellectual triumphs of
 the nineteenth century, we can hardly think so highly of its achievements as to

         Botany and Zoology.

Address to the Department of Botany and Zoology. By Alfred Newton,

   M.A., F.li.S., F.L.S., V.P.Z.S., l}-c., Professor of Zoology and Comparative
   Anatomy in the University of Cambridge, Vice-President.

Any one iu the position of chairman of this Department must feel that his diffi-

culty lies in choosing rather than in seeking a subject whereon to address an

audience like that which is before me. This 'difficulty arises from the astounding

--abundance of interesting topics which are presented by the studies of Botany and

Zoology or of the latter alone, I may say, since it would ill become me to attempt

the treatment of any which belong to the sister science. But it is of course in-

cumbent upon me to touch upon the chief events of the past year which aifect

this Department ; and it seems possible that iu so doing we may lind some con-

siderations naturally proceeding from them to be worthy of your notice during the

short time that I shall presume to occupy your attention, and also to present enough

general interest to justify my enlarging upon the themes which they inspire.

These chief events appear to me to be two in numbei'                                                                                                                                               myIt is  first and pleas-

ing duty to congratulate the naturalists here assembled on the successfid termina-

tion of that expedition in which we have all taken so great an interest, as diuing

its progress tidings of it have reached us from one distant land after another, and

especially (as your mouth-piece) heartilj' to welcome home all now present who

were on board the good ship ' Challenger ' iu her circumnavigation of the globe.

I would that your spokesman on this occasion had been one who was better able

to appreciate their labours and enter into details as to the value of their discoveries

and researches. Unfortunately I am under the great disadvantage of being so im-

perfectly acquainted with the mysteries of the ocean, that it is only possible for me

to speak in the most general terms of what has been done. I feel sure, however,

that, so far as the great secrets of the sea can yet be interpreted and revealed by

men, they -nnll be by those who have happily returned to us. Sir Charles Wyville

Thomson and his colleagues. There is one of their company we know thoj' have

not brought back ; and it is fitting for us to lower the tone of our exultation while

we remember the name of Von Willemoes-Suhm. With this single sad exception

there is, however, nothing, so far as I know, to occasion regi-et ; and the various

memoirs that have been alreadj' published hj members of the Expedition give a

foretaste of what we may expect when the whole of its results are made known.
I am informed that the rich collections made during the voyage are at present

lodged in the University of Edinburgh, and are in process of revision and rough

arrangement under the superintendence of the Director of the Scientific Staii' of

the late Expedition. They include the products of dredging or trawling and sur-

face-collecting at about 350 stations, and at depths varying from lOO to 4500

fathoms, and consist of a prodigious number of specimens belonging to most of the

groups of marine Invcrtchrafn, especialh^ of Sponges and Echinoderms, which pre-

ponderate at the greatest depths. It is, I believe, intended to obtain the assistance

of special experts in working out the difii^rent                                                                                                               groups                              and I am sure this meeting

will hear with pleasure that the Jliidrozoa are to be intrusted to Professor Allman,

and the Poh/zna to Mr. Busk. It is understood that Her Majesty's Treasury will

charge itself with the cost of publishing the treatises of these and the other

eminent  naturalists to be employed                                                                                                                            and thus it is hoped that a         series of volumes
                                                                                                                                                            ;

120 REPORT-- 1876.

and, rememlDeiing liow often similar ambitious undertakings by aur scientific men
in combination with our Government have been baulked by untoward circum-
stances, we cainiot but express the sincere hope that former failures will serve as

useful warnings to ensure future success. I regret extremely mj' inability to say
more on this subject.

   I trust you will not think me to underrate the importance of the safe and

prosperous return of the ' Challenger ' from her voyage, when, though naming it

lirst, I ascribe to it the second place in the events of the past year as regards the

progress of zoological investigation. Other scientific expeditions have before now

left these shores and the shores of other countries, and have more or less fully
attained their purpose, while other expeditions will doubtless in due time be

organized and carried out with, we trust, like happy results. The voyage of the
' Challenger,' though a highly important and, in many respects, a novel one, is

notwithstanding only a unit in a long series which began a century ago, and has

been continued at intervals to our own da)' ; nay, more, since the sailing of the
' Challenger ' we have witnessed the departure of another and larger expedition
for the accomplishment of a still more arduous undertaking. But what I have nov>r
to speak of is a matter that will, if I am not mistaken, in after ages characterize

the present year as an epoch in the history of our sciences inferior only in im-
portance to that which marked some eighteen or nineteen years ago the promul-

gation of a reasonable Theory of Evolution by IMr. Darwin and Mr. "N^'allace. And
while it is to the latter of these two naturalists that we owe the boon that has

-- --recently been conferred on us, it is unr[uestionably from the former labours of

both miited yet distinct that the boon acquires its greatest value. Without
those far higher, far vrider views which the Theory of Evolution enables us to take,
the serried array of facts that bristle throughout the two volumes of the 'Geo-
graphical Distribution of Animals'* which Mr. Wallace has just published would

--have been but a comparatively meaningless aggregation of statements the evi-

dence no doubt of labour almost uusm-passed, tlie accumulation of much that is
curious and of much that is suggestive, but, taken all in all, as serving to an unin-
telligible or insignificant end, if to any end whatever that was not misleading.

   As the case is, the result is very different. But I would a.^k you now, Witliout
the aid afforded by the Doctrine of Descent, would it have been possible to drav.',

as Mr. Wallace has so skilfuUy drawn, those legitimate conclusions from a con-
sideration of the animal life of Java (vol. i. pp. .352, o53), or to arrive at those
marvellous results with respect to the past history of Borneo (vol. i. pp. ooS, ·3.50),
or even to indulge in those daring speculations with regard to the origin of the
Celebesiau fauna (vol. i. pp. 430-438} ? I cite these instances because they are
taken from that part of the world on which the author's labours have before shed

so much light, and with wliich his name is imperishably associated ; but there is

liardlj' any one of his summaries that does not place before us material for reflection
as astounding.

    While, however, assigning to the Theorj' of Evolution the chief glor}' in giving
a real and lasting value to the interpretation of the facts of Animal Distribution, I
must not omit acknowledging the share which Pliysical Geography has contributed
to that end, especially by its marine surveys, which furnish the zoologist with
data as to the depths of seas and oceans, and thereby enable him to judge as to
the former extent of land. It is therefore to be expected that voyages like that of

the ' Challenger,' when their results have been fully worlced out, will still further
add to our knowledge in this respect. Again, too. Geology (Ijut this follows
almost as a matter of course) has in its own line played an equal part. I would
that Botany could be mentioned in this connexion ; but here it seems as if the
eldest of the biological sciences were not, as she usuallj' is, in advance of the rest

and Mr. Wallace's suggestion (vol. ii. p. 162), that Zoology furnishes a key where-

with many of the difliculties besetting the studj- of the Distribution of BL-ints may

be unlocked, will doubtless meet with due attention from botanists.

Of the care aucl labour wliicli the author of this work has bestowed ujxm it, no

one here, I venture to think, has a better right to speak than myself, because it is

not very long- ago that I attempted a dissertation on the Geoo;raphical Distribution

of a single Class of animals*. Though it was the Class with which I am mo-;t
familiar, and though in my attempt I had the invaluable assistance of Mr.
Wallace's manuscript at my side, which cleared my way through many obstacles,

still I found the task one of enormous dithculty, and one which I at times almost

repented that I had undertaken j^et Mr. Wallace has treated not of Birds
                                                                                                                                           ;

only, as I did, but of Mammals, Amphibians, Reptiles, and Freshwater Fishes

to say nothing of the most telling Families of two orders of Insects, with the

Mollusks so far as they were aA"ailable for his purpose. There is nothing that in

turning over the pages of these volumes so luuch strikes one as the energy the}-

evince on the part of their author. Tlnjse who have been most accustomed to the

literature of zoology must admit that there is scarcely any book with which 'The

Geographical Distribution of Animals ' may not, in respect of hard and honest
work, be advantageously compared. It deserves to bear good fruit ; and I am
greatly mistaken if it will not do so. From an educational point of view, it can

hardly fail to be of the greatest service. Attractive as is the subject to those that

know it and see its bearings, the learner has hitherto been repelled from its con-
sideration by the want of any work of general compass which would guide his

studies, while even few of those treatises which have a particular scope were of

much use to him. Mr. Wallace has now placed one in his bauds ; and the result

--we need not trj^ to anticipate. One thing, however, is clear the Distribution of

Animals can no longer be neglected as a secondary' or unimportant part of Zoology.

It only remains for me to add, while thus attempting to setfortli the general merits

myof this learned work, that I by no means pin  faith to all the author's details, or

to all his conclusions. Most of the latter may indeed be justified by the present

imperfect state of our knowledge ; but it does not follow that they will eventually

meet with common acceptance. I must particularly call your attention to the

--admirably cautious words in which he takes leave of his readers words that

prove him to be thoroughly imbued with the right spirit of a true worker in a

--progressive branch of study. Mr. A^'allace saj's :

   " The preceding remarlss are all I uov/ venture to offer, on the distinguishing-

features of the various groups of land-animals as regards their distribution and

migrations. Thej' are at best but indications of the various lines of research

opened up to us by the study of animals from the geographical point of A'iew, and

by looking upon their range in space and time as an important portion of the earth's

--history. . . . Till every well-marked district, every archipelago, and every im-

portant island, has all its known species of the more important groups of animals

catalogued on a uniform plan, and with a uniform nomenclature, a thoroughly

satisfactory account of the Geographical Distribution of Animals will uot be

possible."

And then he goes on to point out that more than this is wanted :

" Many of the most curious relations between animal forms and their habitats,

are entirely unnoticed, owing to the productions of the same locality nrvcr being

Aassociated in our museums and collections.  few such relations have been brought

to light by modern scientific travellers ; but many more remain to be discovered,

and there is probably no fresher and more productive field still unexplored in

Natural History."

   These coincident variations, he concludes by saying, '·' have never been systema-
tically investigated. They constitute an unworked mine of wealth for the enter-

prising explorer; and they may not improbably lead to the discovery of some of

the hidden laws (supplementary to Natural Selection), which seem to be required
in order to account for many of the external characteristics of animals " (vol. ii.

pp. r)ry2, 553).

And now to follow out the idea witli wliich I began. Having touched on the

two chief zoological events of tlie year, let us see if tliey do not suggest something

tliat will not be beneath yoiu- consideration for the remainder of this address. I

have spoken of the certainty of the expedition from which we now welcome our
Weli'ieuds being succeeded by others of similar character.
                                                                                               shall hardly be in-

dulging any vain imagination if we asli: ourselves what we may look foi-ward to

as regards their reports ; and to one point we may perhaps usefully apply ourselves.
   What if a future 'Challenger' shall report of some island, now' known to possess

a, rich and varied animal population, that its present fauna has disappeared ? that

its only Mammals were feral Pigs, Goats, Rats, and Rabbits--with an infusion of

Ferrets, introduced by a zealous " acclimatizer " to checlv the superabundance of

the rodents last named, but contenting themselves with the colonists' chickens ?

that Sparrows and Starlings, brought from Europe, were its only Land-birds, that

--the former had propagated to such an extent that the cultivation of cereals had

ceased to pay the prohibition of bird-keeping boys by the local school-board con-

tributing to the same eHect-- and that the latter ("the "Starlings) having put an end

to the indigenous insectivorous birds by consuming their food, had tm-ned their

attention to the settlers' orchards, so that a crop of fruit was only to be looked for

about once in five years--when the great periodical cyclones had reduced the
number of the depredators ? that the Goats had destroye'd one half of the original

flora and the Rabbits the rest? tliat the Pigs devastated the potatoe-gardens°and

yam-grounds ? This is no fanciful picture. I pretend not to the gift of prophecy

that  is  a  faculty alien  to  the  scientific  mind                              but  if we  may  reason  from  the
                                                                                ;

known to the unknown, from what has been and from what is to what will be I

cannot entertain a doubt that these things are coming to pass ; for I am sure there

are places where what is very like them has already happened.

You may ask why this is so ? why do these lands so speedily succumb to the

strangers from beyond sea ? One part of the answer is ready to hand with those
who have learned one of the first principles of biology which our great master,

Mr. Darwin, has laid down for us. Tlie v.'-eaker, the more generalized forms of
life must always make way for the stronger and more speciaUzed. The other part

of the answer is supplied by Mr. Wallace ; for no one can have studied his volumes

to much purpose without perceiving tliat the inhabitants of oceanic islands and of

the southern hemisphere--the great Australian Region especially, and South
America not much less, are the direct and comparatively speaking "little-chann-ed

descendants of an older, a more generalized and a weaker fauna than are the

present inhabitants of this quarter of the globe, which have been, so to speak,

elaborated by Nature and turned out as the latest and most perfect samples of her

handiwork.

   Set face to face with unlooked-for invaders, and forced into a contest with them
from which there is no retreat, it is not in the least surprising that the natives should

succumb. They have hitherto only had to struggle for existence with creatures of

a like organization ; and the issue of the conflict which has been going on for ages

is that, adapted to tlie conditions under which they find themselves, they maintain

their footing on grounds of equality among one a'nother, and so for centuries they
may have " kept the noiseless tenor of their wav." Suddenly man interferes and
lets loose upon them an entirely new race of animals, which act and react in a

thousand different fashions on their circumstances. It is not necessary that the

new comers should be predacious ; they may be so far void of offence as to abstain

from assaulting the aboriginal population ; but they occupy the same haunts and
consume the same food. The fruits, the herbage, and other supplies that sufficed

to support the ancient fauna now have to furnish forage for tlie invaders as well.
Their effects on the flora there is no need for me to trace, since Dr. Hooker ex-
pressly made them one of the themes of that discourse to which many of us listened
with rapt attention a few years since at this Association. But the consequences of

the inva,sion to the native fauna have never been so fullv made known. The new
comers are creatures whose organization has been prepared by and for combat

throughout generations innumerable. Their ancestors have been elevated in the

scale of being by the discipline of strife. Tlieir descendants inherit the developed

qualities that enabled those ancestors to win a hard-fought existence when the
animals around them were no higher in grade than those among which the de-

scenclauts are now thrown. Can we doubt that the victory inclines to the heirs of

the ancient conquerors ? The struggle is like one between an army of veterans

and a population unused to warfare. It is that of Spaniards with matchlocks and

coats of mail against Aztecs with feather cloaks and bows and aiTows. Ahihi

Asalus vietis.  few years, and tlie majority of native species are exterminated. But

this is not the worst. The species which perish most quickly are just those that

naturalists would most wish to preserve ; for they are those pecidiar and endemic

forms that in structure and constitution represent the ancient state of things upon

the earth, and supply us with some of the most instructive evidence as to the

Order of Nature.

With the progress of civilization it is plain that there will soon be hardly a laud

but will bear the standard of a Em-opean nation or of a community of European

descent, and, as things are going on, be overrun by their imports. If this wei-e

inevitable it would be useless to complain. But is it inevitable ? Is it not obvious

that most of this extermination is being carried on nuwittingly? and may not some

of it be avoided by proper precautions? If so, should not men of science make a

stand, and interest the ignorant or careless in the importance of the subject ? I

cannot divest myself of the belief that the course of tlie next century will see the

extirpation, not only of mo.st of the peculiar faunas I had in view a few minutes ago,

but of a great multitude of other species of animals throughout all parts of the

world. The regret with which I regard such extirpation is not merely a matter of

Asentiment. Here sentiment aod science are for once on the same side.                                                                                                             heavy

blow will be inflicted on Zoology^ by the disappearance of some of these marvellous

and peculiar forms. There is no one species of animal whose structure and habits

have been so completely investigated that absence of the means of further exami-

nation would not be a distinct deprivation to vScience and as what Science has
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

done is only an earnest of vrhat she will do, we cannot say that the time shall ever

come when the want of those means will not be severely felt. It is then for

scientilic men, and for naturalists especially, to consider whether they are not

bound, in the interest of their successors, to interpose more than they have hitherto

given any sign of doing.

But outside this audience there are many who care little for consequences lilce

these. Such persons may, however, be impressed by thinldng that the indiscrimi-

nate destruction of animals which, in one way or another, is now going on, must

sooner or later lead to the extirpation of many of those which minister to our

wants, whether of comfort or luxury. The fur-bearing creatures will speedily, if

they do not already, requu'e some protection to be generally accorded to them ; and

that such protection can be efiectually given is evident if we take the trouble of

inquiring as to the steps taken by the Russian local authorities in Alaska, and now,

I believe, continued by those of the United States, for limiting the slaughter of the

Sea-Otter and the Fur-Seals of the adjacent islands to particular seasons. No one

can suppose that, even with the assistance we get from Siberia, our supply of ivory
will continue what it now is when the interior of Africa is pacified and settled,
as we can liardly doubt that it one day will be and, unless we can find some sub-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

stitute for that useful substance before that day comes, it would be only prudent

to do something to check the wasteful destruction of Elephants. Many people
may think that the continent of Afi-ica is too vast and its animal life too luxuriant
for tlie efforts of man materially to affect it. If we inquire, however, we shall find

that this is not the case, and that there is an enormous tract of country, extending

far beyond our colonies and the territories of the neighbouring Republics, from

which most of the larger Mammals have already disappeared. There is good

reason to believe that at least one species has become extinct within the last tive-

and-twenty years or thereabouts                                                                                                                                                   and though I do not mean to say that this species,

befall its fellows ; while to the Zoologist its extirpation is a matter of moment,

being probably the first case of the total extinction of a large terrestrial mammal

from the earth. The Manatee and Dugoug have been recklessly killed off from

hundreds of localities wliere but a century or so since they abounded ; and with
them the stores of valuable oil that they furnished have been lost. That ver}' re-
markable Sireuian the huge JRJiytina ffiffas has become utterly extinct. The greed
of -whalers is believed to have had the same effect on a Cetacean (the Bahena
biscai/ensis) which was once the cause of a flourishing industry on the coasts of
France and Spain. The same greed has almost exterminated the flight Whale of
the northern seas, and is fast accomiilishing the same end in the case of Seals all

over the world. You are probably aware that an Act of Parliament, passed in the
session of 1875, was intended to put some check upon those bloody massacres that
annually take place on the floating ice of the Korlh Atlantic," to which these
creatures resort at the time of bringing forth their young, when

                                        "Sires, mothers, children iu one carnage lie."

But, whether through oflicial indiflereuce, or what, I know not, the treaties with

foreign nations authorized by that Act were not completed ; and last spring, at the
solicitation of certain Aberdeen or Peterhead shipowners, the Board of Trado

allowed "one year more" of wholesale slaughter. Whatever other nations might

-- --like to do, our hands at least should have been unstained ! It is admitted that iu

certain manufactures that of jute, for instance animal oil is absolutely necessary.

It is eas)^ to see that before long there will be very little animal oil forthcoming.

There is another Class of animals with whose well-b;^ing the interests of man

are largely connected. It cannot be denied that our Fisheries are year by year

subjected to an ever-increasing strain, through the rapidly increasing population of

these islands, and are giving unmistakable signs of being unable to bear it. But

it must be admitted that the consideration of their case is fraught with unusual

difliculties. Commissions, either Royal or Parliamentary, have been appointed

one after another to inquire into the facts and to seek a remedy, if one is to be

found, for the falling-off. It is with great diffidence that I venture to pass any

criticism on the recommendations made by those Commissions, and especially on

such as were contained in the lleport of a Commission the constitution of which

was such as to inspire the greatest respect, since men so eminent as Prof. Huxley

and Mr. Iloldsworth were named in it. That Commission reported in effect that

there was nothing to be done with our Sea-Fisheries but to leave things alone. I

do not profess to quote the words of the lieport (which, indeed, I have not seen
--for
a  long  time)                          but  in  substance, I  believe,  it  amounted   to                                                                              this :  That the
                                     ;

natiu-al enemies to which Fishes were exposed were so multitudinous, so crafty,

and so rapacious, that their destruction b}' man was verj" slight in comparison, and

that his interference might be safely neglected iu considering its consequences.

Now it has always seemed to me that the Commissioners on this occasion sufl'ered

themselves to be deceived. Well aware of how little is known as to the indirect

effects of man's acts in regard to the lower animals, and in their fear lest any rm-

forseen bad results should follow from measures intended to be remedial, they re-

commended none at all. But I fail to discern that land or sea makes finj' essential

-- --difference in the laws of life. The balance of Nature must be preserved as steadily

in a dense as in a rare fluid in water as in air or all will not go well. What-

ever be the weight in either scale, equipoise is as easily destroyed by an ounce as

by a ton. The marine Fishes that are of such commercial importance (Cod, Her-

--rings, and the like) have naturallj-, no doubt, enemies innumerable Dogfisb, Cor-

morants, Porpoises, and what not ; but we know that, owing to their fertility and

habits, the Cod and Herrings have continued till lately to contend successfully

v.'ith these drawbacks and to maintain their numbers. It matters not if only one

egg of the 10,G00, or whatever be the number in the roe of a Herring, produces a

flsh that arrives at maturity and escapes its natural enemies, so long as that one

Nowfish is sufficient to supply the place of its parent.                     this, according to the

arrangement of Nature, has hitherto been the case. But if, instead of that fish

living to propagate its kind, it is cut off before its time hj an enemy against whom

Nature has made  no                     provision, her  balance  is  at once destroyed                                                                                  and     the oftener
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

the operation is repeated the sooner will the numbers of the species dwindle; and

the dwindling will go on in a rapidly accelerated ratio. Therefore it seems that,
                                                               -- --a;

8) far from leaving our yea-Fisheries unrestricted, it is highly uocessary t'l
impose some limitation upon them ; and, so far from dreading interference,
our interference is at present so fiital that further interference of another
kind is rei^uired as a counterbalance; while that counterhalauce Science only can

apply.

 --As much may be said for those other industries, in common speech also

called "fisheries" the taking of Oysters, Crabs, and Lobsters, all of which have
lately been diminishing in a still more alarming degree. Here Parliament has
wisely resolved to interpose, though whether the manner of interposition is wise

seems to be a matter on which, as few natm'alists have been consulted, we liad

better reserve our opinion.

   Thus, without troubling j'ou with many technical details, I have striven to lay
before you a sketch of man's treatment of some of his fellow-creatures, and of the

effects which have sprung, or certainly will spring, from it. There is probably
hardly an island on which he has set foot, the fauna and flora of which has not
been in some degree influenced b)' his even temporary' presence ; there is assnredly
not a continent, though a continent takes longer to subdue : and his control does
not stop at the shore; for, if what I have been advancing is true, the inhabitants of
the deep come also more or less under his dominion. I invite you to contemplate
whether it is always, or even generally, that of a beneficent ruler. But it will
doubtlijss be urged that this kind of thing has gone on for ages--ever since life

first existed on the earth. I may be told, in the words of the great poet of the
country in which we now find ourselves,

                                   " Look abroad through Nature's range,
                                         Nature's mighty law is change

                                                                               ?
                                 To  oppose             great  Nature's  plan

I would answer from the same source that

                              " man, to whom alone is giv'n

                            A ray direct from pitying Heav'n,"

.should by means of tliat ray not oppose Nature, but r.ather second her preser\ati\'e

measures. That ray is the ray of Science. "VYe can only govern Nature by obeying

her, only by obeying her can we assist her. To obay her laws we must know

them                         what can we know of them but what Science         teaches   us ?
                          ;

It may be said that I have taken too gloomy a view of this matter of the extirpa-

ti(m of animals by man. I wish I could think so. But I believe that if we go tu

worli in the right way there is yet time to save many an otherwise expiring species.

In this country there is happily a strong disposition, which gi-ows stronger day by

day, to preserve our wild animals. It is very desirable that this feeling should

--not be limited to the British Islands. If it is, as I maintain, a right feeling

feeling sanctioned alike by humanity, by Science, and by our own material interests

it cannot be too widely disseminated. But its propagation must not be left to

humanitarians and sentimentalists, whose eftbrts are siu-e to be brought to nothing-

through ignorance arid excess of zeal, nor to economists, whose endeavours would

unquestionably fall short of what is required. The ofliciousuess of the one class

and the slackness of the other must equally be tempered by the naturalist. He

can be trusted not to interfere with the use, but with the abuse, of the animal

world. Onh' to do this he must place himself in the forefront of the movement

for he can submit to no other leader. lie alone has, or should have, that Imow-

ledge which gives the power of coping successfully with the difficidt questions that

will  arise                      and the advantage  it  gives liim he must          not  abstain  from exercising.
                              ;

If, without offence, I might here paraphrase some vener.iblo words, I would say

that, according to the greatness of this power, we must preserve those that are

otherwise appointed to die.

 --The Future of PJiijsiological. Research. Address to the Department ofAnatowy

     and Physiology. By John Geet M'Kendeick, M.D., FeJloiv of the Royal

      Colleye'of Physicians, and of the Royal Society, of Edinburgh.

     Bearing in mind the fact that one of the objects of the British Association is to
  interest the public in the advancement of scientific truth, it has been the practice
  of the Pi'esidents of the Tarious Sections to make some remarks of a general cha-
  racter, or to give a remme of the recent progress of science in their particidar

 department. I shall follow so far the example of my predecessors. I shall not

  attempt to enumerate, far less to describe, the contributions made to anatomical
  and physiological science during the past year, because that vvoidd entail a long
  and wearisome report regarding investigations with which most of us are abeady
  acquainted by the perusal of those excellent summaries that appear from time to
 time in our scientific and medical peiiodicals. With the Tiew of limiting the
 scope of this address, I propose to oft'er a few observations bearing generally
 upon some of the scientific and social relations of anatomy and physiology, with
 the view of interesting the public in what we have been doing, and what we hope

 yet to do.

    These sciences present different views of the same great system of truth. Each
 can be conceived as existing independently, wliile at the same time the one science
 is the complement of the other. Anatomy is the science of organic form, while
 physiology is that of organic f miction. The anatomist investigates structure, its
 form, general arrangements, and laws, and he may include in his survey the pnr-
 poses or functions which the strncture fulfils. Eecently an opinion has been pre-
 valent, and has cropped up in various quarters, that anatomy is but a preparatoiy

 science for physiology. This opinion has probably arisen in consequence of the

rapid growth of physiological science during the last twenty or thirty years. But
there can be no doubt that anatomy has a role of her own by no means inferior to
that of physiology. She lias to educe formal laws which determine the structure
 of organized bodies and their parts, and thus she establishes the basis for scientific
classification and arrangement. Anatomy is the beginning, of coiu-se, of all medical
education, and the groundworlc on which the practical arts of medicine and sur-

 geiy are reared ; but in a broader sense, the science has to do with the structure of
every animal, from the simplest to the most complex ; and from the facts obtained

in the investigation of the structure of any animal, we are able to recognize the

relationships it has with other animals, or, in other words, its position in the Zoolo-

gical scale.

                                      Methods op Anatomy.

    The methods of anatomical science are dissection, description, and comparison.
These methods have been followed by anatomists from the birth of the science ; but
in recent times they have been largely supplemented by the use of the microscope,
and by the emplo;^Tuent of various modes of preparing tissues for microscopical
inquiiy. Now-a-days the anatomist not only describes naked-eye appearances dis-
played by the art of dissection, but he scrutinizes every tissue and organ with the
aid of the microscope. Hence it is, the historian of the progress of anatomical
knowledge in this centuiy will have to relate, as one of its chief features, the deve-
lopment of microscopical anatomy or histology. In no department of scientific
work is greater activity manifested at present than in this. Scarcely a month
passes without adding materially to our stores of knowledge, so as to make it

almost impossible for a man to keep abreast of modern histology, and at the same

time devote due attention to other departments of anatomy and physiology. In
Germany and France men devote their energies to histology as to the business of
their lives, and occupy chairs in many uni^-ersities distinct from those of anatomy

and pliysiology. In this country, from social and other considerations, such a divi-
sion of labour'is not generally made, but the time will assuredly come when it must

be done.

                                                    Histology.

   It may be supposed from these remarks that I regard histology as lying entirely
wilLin the province of anatomy. By no means. Histology is neutral territory

between botli. It is that department of knowledge where tlie two sciences over-
lap. The physiologist must investigate minute structure, in which the beginnings
oi^pliysiological processes take place, because without Imowledge of it all his ideas

Whenas to functions of organs or tissues would be superficial and unsatisfactory.

a physiologist examines a tissue, or a section of an organ, however, the morpholo-

gical aspect is not what is prominently before his mind, but its mode of function.
To him the form, size, position, and relations of tlie cell are not the special subjects

of interest, but its probable mode of action in the economy. He therefore wishes

it coidd be seen working, or at all events in conditions as nearly normal as possible.

This desire has ab-eady led to the invention of various new methods of research,

such as those of the hot stage, or plans for the observations of changes in cells or
fibres in parts accessible to the microscope, methods which have already been fruitful
of good residts. I have a firm belief that this line of work has by no means been
followed to the end, and that along it the physiologist 'will still be conducted to

rich harvests in the fields of histological research.

                                    Methods of Physiolooy.

   The kindred science of physiology has for its object the elucidation of unction,
and it has, in addition to the methods of anatomy (namely, dissection, description,
and comparison), those of pathological observation and experimentation. It is con-
fessedly the science most ditficidt of all to prosecute. The subjects of investiga-
tion are intricate in structm-e, and are formed of complex chemical materials, which
are in constant interaction with the surrounding world. Each animal is a machine,
the intricacies of which are infinitely more involved than those of any human
mamrfacture. To stop this machine, in the attempt to discover the action of one
of its parts, is a proceeding, in many instances, v/hich interferes with the very part
the action of which we wish to find out. As we descend in the scale of animal
life, and the machine becomes less complex, this difficidty is not so obtrusive, inas-
much as in many animals of simple organization there is not the same dependence

of organ upon organ, and of tissue iipon tissue, as we find in the more complex.

But in most experimental researches in other sciences the conditions are also mani-
fold, and tlie acumen of the philosopher in all is tested in distinguishing the essen-
tial from the non-essential conditions.

    In the further prosecution of physiology as a physical science, which it really is,
experimental inquirj', with the aid of precise instruments, and the facts derived

from the observation of the course and effects of disease, seem to me to be the two

lines of evidence which will in future weigh with us in coming to just conclusions.

No doubt it is quite true that much of the minute anatomy of the human body,

and more so of the minute anatomy of the bodies of the lower animals, is still

unknown, and tliat tliere are probably many details, visible only to the microscope,
not yet discovered, which may influence our opinions as to the exact functions of

parts. This is especially true of the structure of the ncrve-centi'es. Vs'e have at
present only very general conceptions of the arrangements of the cells and fibres in
these parts, and it is highly probable that future discoveries in this difficidt field of

investigation may change our views, not only of nervous action in general, but of

the functions of particular centres. Accordingly there can be little doubt that as
tlie naked-eye dissection has revealed structural arrangements which have hitherto
 guided the physiologist to correct notions of function, so in the future a similar
 service will be done to physiology by the histologist. Still physiology will have to
 depend less on aid of this nature, and more on the facts obtained by the methods

                                                                                                   l3*

of patliological observation and expeviment. These methods are essentially of tlic

same order. Tbey vary the circumstances of the phenomenon we Avish to investi-
gate, and, by the application of well-known logical rides, we succeed in eliminating

the cause of a phenomenon from its indifferent accompaniments. Diseased condi-

tions, as has been weU said, are experiments ready at hand, and every physician

and surgeon of scientific spirit is from day to day engaged in investigating these

conditions, not oiJy with the view of curing his patient, but with the hope of

throwing light on complex physiological processes. But direct experiment has the

advantage over the observation of pathological effects, that it enables us to vary

the conditions of the phenomenon as we desire. Thus the functions of the nerves

were ascertained by the experiment of dividing each in turn, and watching the

Wheneffect.  a function is arrested immediately on the division of a nerve, it is

held that that function reqiures the nerve in order to its performance.

   I make these remarks regarding the value of the experimental method in phj'-
siology, because we cannot forget the attempt whicli has recently been made

to restrict us in the use of this important aid in prosecuting our science. I shall

not enter again upon the controversy which has raged in this country regard-

ing experiments upon animals, because by the passing of the Bill a practical

solution of the question has been arrived at in the mean time, and it now

becomes us, as good citizens, to do all in our power to carry out the provisions of

the act, and to give it a fair trial. I may be permitted to saj', however, that I

always recognized the right of the public to agitate on this question if they consi-

dered that cruelty was being perpetrated. I hope the day will never come when

tales of suffering inflicted either on man or beast will be heard by us with calm

indifference. The complaint I have against a section of the public is, that they

belie\ed apparently all they were told, and condemned us without waiting for

explanation or defence. At the same time, it was not wise to meet this agitation

with contempt and scorn ftn- the ignorance of those who carried it on ; and it seems
to me that the appointment of a Ro^'al Connnission to investigate the facts of the

case was the best thing that coidd have been done by the Government. That

--Commission was composed of three eminent statesmen Lord Cardwell, Lord

AMnmarleigh, and Mr. Fcu-ster ; of a great lawyer, skilled in the art of obtaining

and weighing evidence, Sir John  Karslake                                             of  one of the leading biologists in this

country, Professor Huxley ; of a surgeon who knew the relation of physiology to

the practical art of treating disease, Mr. Erichsen ; and of a leading journalist and

most able thinker, Mr. Ilutton, the editor of the ' Spectator.' Thus composed of

men Ukely by character and previous training to ascertain the truth, and to suggest

wise procedures, it held numerous meetings, examined witnesses partial and impar-

tial, collected a body of evidence of a most interesting and diverse character, and

gave in a report which, while it recommended legislation, is generally in t^ivour of

lihysiologists. No one can read the evidence in the blue book, and the report

to.inded thereon, without coming to the conclusion that the case of those who

r lised the outcry against physiologists in this coimtry completely broke down. On                                               I
considering this report, the Government brought in a Bill, certain of the provisions

of which seemed not only oppressive to physiologists, but were calcidated, if carried

into law, to impede tht^ progress of science. The members of the medical profes-

sion who knew the \olne of the experiuieutal method in physiological research,
and who were painfully conscious of the many imperfections of the art due to want

of knowledge, were now arotised, and, by a use of the machinery of the ' British

Medical Association,' they aided the few physiologists of the cotmtry in making

representations to the Government, which were favourably received, and whicli

led to important modifications in the bill. That bill has now passed into law, and

I appeal to our opponents to desist from further agitation. The case has been tried

and the verdict has been given. For my own part I was all along opposed to

legislation as being quite unnecessary in the circumstances; but I had, at the same

time, that confidence in the common-sense and good feeling of our legislators, as to

I'xpecL a bill favourable to physiologilijt.s when the facts were put before tiiem.

Home ol" our oppoueuts, led away by tlieir feelings, have put in print many erroneous

statements. Ilosts of pamphlets* have been circulated, many of them well meant,

biitutterly wrong both in form and matter. For a seasou these pamphlets pro-

duced eflects, and many people of good intentions were led astray. But a reaction

liegan, and when the leading members of the medical profession came forward

boldly and stated their opinions, it was soon completed.

The only preventive for such casual excitements is the diflusion of Iniowledge.

I have no beUef whatever in the theory that most people are fools on questions of

 this kind. The gi'eat majority of our people of both sexes are perfectly capable of

, reasoning and of forming sound opmions. What they require is knowledge, evi-

dence, and representations strong enough to overcome the bias of prejudice. I

therefore warn om- opponents that if the agitation be continued, we will appeal to

Wethe bar of public opinion.  will instruct the public through the press, on the

].)latform, and by the pamphlet, and I have no fear of wliat the issue will be. The

i'act that the members of the medical profession who, by Iniowledge and habits of

thought, are best competent to judge in this matter, acted as they did, indicates at

once the result.

                  Importance of teaching Biology.

This leads me to sav a word as to the diffusion of biological knowledge amon n
Athe people. I regard this as one of the healthiest signs of our day.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               general

knowledge of the structure and functions of the human body, of its necessities, of

those agencies which act prejudicially upon it, and of those conditions which favom'

long life, the relief of pain, the prevention of sickness, and the ti-ansmission of

healthy offspring, cannot fail in being of high practical importance. Furthermore,

tlie acquisition of knowledge of the general laws of life as seen in the various living

things about us, in addition to being an intellectual training of great value, will

probably engender a feeling of Idndness for every living thing, and thus even

animals will share in the benefit. At one time knowledge of this kind was almost

wholly reserved for the  medical profession                                                                                      but  now it  is  taiight                                                                                                                                                            in eveiy vUlage

from my own experience of this matter, that there is no diihculty whatever in so

treating the subject as to make it interesting and instructive v.-ithout giving it too

I cannot help mentioning the name of Professor Huxley in connexion with fjje

introduction of this gi-eat subject among our educational apphances, both as (o
what should be taught, and how to teach it; and it may not be considered prf-
sumptuous in me to predict that this alone will entitle himto a place in the thonghls

of posterity.

                 rpACTiCAL Aspects of Anatomy and Phy.siology.

   There is an imprestsion in the minds of juariy regarding our scientific work whicli

T would like to remove; and here I direct my remarks, not to purely scientific men,
but to the public. Many stiU think that anatomy and physiology ha\e no practical

hide, and consequently they do not take that interest in their prosecution which
they otherwise would do. The results of the triumphs of physics, cheniistrv, and
                                                                                       ;

130 REPORT--1876.

engiueeriiig are so patent to all as to excite universal interest, so that you will

often tind a man of average intelligence readily engrossed in any new discovery of
physics or of chemistiy, while he is uiditferent to new facts in the domam of

biological science. This state of mind, of course, is due to a want of appreciation

of the practical aspect of our work ; and I hold that tiU the man be better informed,

he is qvute entitled to take this \iew of the matter. But I wish to point out that,

although oiu- sciences occupy their o^vn place as abstract systems of truth, bearing

no apparent relation to the wants either of humanity or of the lower animals, still

Mythey have also a practical aspect of the highest importance.  belief is that

evei*y advance in science, by adding to the sum of himian knowledge, and thus

enabling man to have a correct idea of his true position in the universe, and of his

relations to it, wiU ultimately promote both his ovm material well-being and that
of the other livmg things about him. I do not see how it can be otherwise ; and

the history of the past supports this view. Knowledge promotes civilization ; and

the progress of civilization, on the whole, lessens suffering and increases the

physical sources of happiness both to man and beast. The thought must therefore

be urged, that eveiy research, however far removed it may appear to be at first

from havmg any relation to the welfare of living things, occupies its j^lace in leading

--to this grand consummation Ufe, liberty, and happiness to all. From many illus-

trations which occm* to the mind, I shall take oiily one. M. Pastern- proved that

in the atmosphere there exist germs or particles of matter, caU them what you

will, which excited fermentation and putretaction in certain fliuds. Of this, I think

there cannot be any reasonable doubt. Whether fermentation be always the residt

of the presence of germs is another question, upon which I shall not enter, nor shall

I engage on a discussion of the question of so-called spontaneous generation, which,

mythough higlJy probable, has never, in  opinion, been proved. These investiga-

tions of Pasteur, relating to which a great controversy has taken place, referred to

animal and vegetable organisms of the very humblest type, organisms so small that

to prove their veiy existence in the air, indirect and complicated methods of

procediu-e had to be adopted. But Mr. Lister, who once occupied the Chair of

Surgery in this University, and who now adorns the Chair of Chnical Surgery in

Edinburgh, was attracted, whilst he was in Glasgow, by the doctrines of the

eminent French chemist ; he repeated experiments to satisfy himself of their truth,

and he came to the conclusion that these particles in the air are the som'ces of

disturbance in wounds, leading to suppuration, putrefaction, and many gi-ave

constitutional symptoms. To remove the influence of these germs, he devised the

antiseptic system of treating wonnds, a .system first put into operation in this city,

--and which is attended with great success in the hands of tliose who practice it

carefully. Slowly but surely this system the greatest advance in surgery since

--the days of John Ilmiter is winning its way in this country, on the continent, and

in America. The surgica,l mind is eminently conservative and not easily convinced

but it gives way after a struggle, and the benefit both of the preliminary caution
and of the subsequent vigorous adoption is to humanity. What does the prac-

tice of this system of treating wounds mean? It means, speaking generally,

the banishment of pyaemia and surgic.al fever from hospitals, the jiossibUity of

performing many serious operations with comparatiAe safety to the patient, the

relief of pain in the dressing of wounds, and the saving of human lives. I need

scarcely add that Professor Lister did much in his earher years to give him a high

place among British physiologists, but, in addition, he has showed the successfid

apphcationof purely scientific knowledge to the advancement of the art of sm'geiy;

and in suggesting a method by which life may be saved and suffering mitigated, he

has earned the gratitude of humanity.

          Impobtance of In^t-stigations on the Physiological Action
                                        OF Active Substances.

   There is another field of physiological research which promises to confer great

practical benefit on the human race. I refer to the investigation of the physio-
logical action of active substances, which may lead us not only to the discovery of
                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                             131

important therapeutic agents, but to a knowledge of the relation -which exists

between the chemical constitution of a substance find its physiological effects.

Already a considerable amount of work of this kind has been accomplished. The

physiological action of the various anajsthetics (such as chloroform, chloral, alcohol,

&c.), of narcotics (such as morphia, narceine, narcotine, codeine, and many others),

and of alkaloids (such as strychnine, brucine, nicotine, atropine, hyoscyamine, physo-

stigmine, muscarine, veratrine, acouitine, digitaliuc, santonine, ergotine, and quinine)

has been carefidly studied. The celebrated research of Professor Crum Brown

and Dr. Thomas K. Fraser, upon tlie physiohigical action of the methyl-, amyl-, and

ethyl-substitution compounds of ceitaiu aUialoid^, in which they showed that a

change in chemical composition was attended by a change in physiological action,

opened up a new held of discoveiy. The investigations of Dr. B. W. Richardson

on the action of homologous series of alcohols and ethers, and the obsers'ations

made by Professor Dewar and myself on the action of the chinoHne and pyridine

series of bases, and their substitution compoiuids, all tended to illustrate the same

general truth. Nor must I forget to mention an interesting series of investigations

(7

made by Professor Gamgee, of Manchester, and his pupils, communicated to our

Section' and at the present meeting, on the action of Aarious compoiuids of the

rare metal vanadium, on the action of chromimu salts, and on the differences

between the physiological actions of ortho-, meta-, and pyi-o-phosphoric acids.

Here, again, we had a further illustration of the important facts that the physio-

logical action of any active substance is affected (1) by the number of atoms in the

molecule and its complexity of structure, and (2) by the degree of stability of the

molecule. Tliat is to say, the more coniplex the molecule, the more intense and

prolonged Avill its action probably be ; and, on the other hand, if the molecule of a

substance tend readily to break dovm or split up while circulating in the blood, it

will act more intensely than if it held firmly togetiier for a considerable time.

These generalizations are merely tentative. Vre have not yet sufficient data to

entitle us to term them general laws.

  Now no one can glance oxer any work on organic chemistry without seeing on

e^-ery page the names of substances regarding the physiological action of which we

know nothing. I would not have these mvestigated in a promiscuous manner,

with the vague hope of coming upon something new. Here, as elsewhere in

science, we must be guided so far by the light cast upon the unkno-«ai by former

discoveries, and by those general laws which have been formulated by previous

im-estigators. Nor is the mere discovery of new poisons any thing but a " sorry

task," unless the research lead us to an agent likely to be of therapeutic value, or

to the enimciation of an important general principle. But former experience
warrants us in hoping, nay in expecting, that new useful agents will yet be disco-

\ered. I need not refer to the practical applications of cliloroform and ether, as

these are too well known   to need  any eulogy from  me                    but  I  may be allowed                               to
                                                                        ;

direct attention to chloral, first discovered by Liebig in 18.32, and known for many

years merely as the ultimate product of chlorine upon alcohol. It was only a few

years ago that Liebreich, of Berlin, pointed out its important physiological action,

and it is now recognized as a therapeutic agent of the highest Aalue. Its use, no

doubt, has often been sadly abused, and people have often trifled with a powerful

physiological agent even to the loss of their lives ; but when we think of the hours
of pain v\-liich many a weary sufferer has e-;caped by its use, we cannot but regard

it as a boon to humanity.

Here the physiologist must go hand in hand with the chemist. The chemist in

his laboratory prepares the substances, and builds up new compoiuids by those

wonderful  synthetic  processes which  are now the gloiy of                his     science                              it  is  then
                                                                                                                     ;

the duty of the physiologist to investigate the actions of these. By imited work,

who can foretell what may be accomplished ? For example, may we not hope to

see the day when such a substance as quinine, or a substance having similar
therapeutic properties, may be produced artificially ; or, may we not obtain an

anajstnetic as potent and even less dangerous than those at present employed ?

   Nor have we yet investigated the physiological action of the active principles of
thousands of plants, many of which may prove to be of great value. Let us

ceived the notion of the phj^siological antagonisms of drugs, -which is generally
regarded as quite modern, although the practice of using antidotes has been
followed from the earliest times. Thus in the interview between tlie Queen and

affording assistance to medicine, and, on tlie other, pointing upwards to psychology as

the greater sister of the three. Abandoning metaphor, there can be no doubt physio-

logy is most intimately connected with these sciences. First of all, with regard to

medicine (and by this" term of course I mean the whole art of detecting and curiiig

di-ease), there arem any problems Avhich physiology alone can solve. The origin of

disease, the steps of the clianges by which organs and tissues become so altered as

to produce what is called a diseased state, the effects of one diseased organ upon

others which are healthy, the actions of remedial substances, both in the healthy

and in the diseased condition, are all physiological processes, many of which cannot,

in the present condition of society, be thoroughly investigated by a practitioner,

who is often too busy a man to engage in this kind of work. Such labour must be

handed over, to a large extent, to a special class of men. They must investigate,

--experiment, and work up the subject in the laboratory either the physiological

laboratory of the university or school of medicine, or of the hospital or infirmaiy--

as the business of their lives, and from time to time announce the results. These

results must be checked by past experience, or by a Iniowledge of cases apposite to

the point, by the men who come into daily contact witli patients, and their verdict,

so far as any practical benefit is concerned, must usually be regarded as iinal.

fever at an early stage, and the iuvettigation of those diseases which destroy

thousands of our domestic animals, are all subjects which must be investigated

more systematically and on a larger scale than has yet been done. Such stupendous

work can scarcely be left to individual effort. To carry it on recjuires men, time,

and money; and'these can only be supplied by the aid of governments, or munici-

Professor Burdon Sanderson and his cradjutors, by Dr. Klein, and by Dr. Thudi-

but still the amoimt of aid gi-^-en is small alongside of what is lavished, for

factiire, testing, and equipment of an 80-ton gun, designed to destroy human life

and property (no doubt on the theory that it is for the ultimate welfare of the

State to do so), a small sum would be necessary ; but authorities do not yet see the

but we look for more. I hope to see the day when Government will equip and

thoroughly furnish a body of men for the investigation on a large scale of the

genesis of such diseases as tubercle or of typhus fever, both of wl'.ich kill in Great

Britain alone thousands of people aiinualh', just as they have sent cut a 'Chal-

lenger' expedition to explore the depths of the sea, or have at present a number of

brave men engaged in the attempt to discover the North Pole. To strike at the

root of one of those great maladies that afflict the human race, such as cancer,

tubercle, or fever, weidd confer an inestimable blessing' on humanity, and honour on

the Government that proposed and carried out the imdertaking.

                         Relation of Physiology to Psychology.

   As I have said, physiology is intimately connected with psychology, or of the
science of the mind ; and as this department of pliysiolegical "work has lately been

my chief study, I may be allowed to refer to it a little more in detail.

  --Psj'chology may be divided into two parts : first, all those pl;enon:cna which we

may include under the term mind properly so called, such as feeling, volition, and

intellectual processes ; and second, tlie phenomena which are associated with, and

which indicate the alliance between, mind and matter. Every mental act may be

--regarded in the present state of knowledge as liaving a double aspect on the one

side it is known to our consciousness, and on the other side it is tl;e result of a
number of physical processes occurring in tlie brain.

                                The Methods of Psychology.

   In the investigation of mental pdienomena, two modes of inquiry have been
b.itheito followed. First, that of introspection and reflection, in which the inves-
tigator looks within himself for the facts of his experience ; and f ecor.d, that of tl;o
examination of physiological processes which coincide with sensorial or mental

changes. It is evident that the first of these methods, usually called the subjective,

is open to the objection that by it a mind attempts to obseive its own operations,
and that the proceeding is somewhat analogous to asking a machine to im estigate
its ovvni mechanism. This objection, urged in other words by Comte, Maudsley,
and others, may be answered by replying that the subjective method does not
attempt to explain the physiological phenomena concomitant with mental states,
--134 REPORT 1876.

but the laws whicli regulate these mental states themselves. Suppose a compli-
cated machine possessed consciousness, I can readUy understand that by the
exercise of this consciousness it might be unable to discover the relation and

mechanism of its own parts, because in attempting to do so the machinary would

be so interfered with as to prevent normal action ; but it might still be able to
study the products of its operations. I do not, therefore, decry this old method of

psychological research, as it is so much the fashion to do in these days. Apart

altogether from the philosophical speculations and systems of philosophy founded

upon them, I think many data accumidated by such men as Locke, Berkeley,
David Hume, Thomas lleid, Dugald Stewart, Thomas Bro^^^l, Sir William
Hamilton, and James Mill have as good a right to be considered correct as some
of the quasi-metaphysical conceptions of modern physical science. Subjective
inquiry carried on by such men cannot be given up as a mode of psychological
research. It may not carry us much further than it has done, but it has rendered
good ser^ice already, and may possibly do more.

   But, on the otlier hand, the object! \e method appears to me to be the one which,

in future, will be principally cultivated ; and it is for this reason that, as a ph^'.-iolo-

gist, I wish especially to refer to it.

   It is the busmess of physiology to supply psychology with information regarding
physical processes occurrhig in the nervous system ; and it is one of the special
features of the physiology of the present day to direct attention to the physical

side of mental phenomena. No doubt Aristotle, Hobbes, and Hartley incorporated
into their psychological theories much that was purely physiological ; but in their

days the physiology of the nervous system was in a crude state, and, consequently,
did not lead to great results. In comparatively recent times, a new inductile and
experimental department of science has arisen, the nature of which is indicated
by the term physiological psychology, and wliich is being diligently cultivated by
numerous workers, both at home and abroad. In our own country the writings
and researches of Herbert Spencer, Alexander Bain, Dr. Laycock, George Henry
Lewes, Dr. Maudsley, Dr. Carpenter, Alfi'ed Barratt, and James Sidly, and on the
continent those of Fechner, Ilelmholtz, Wundt, Hermann Lotze, Taine, Donders,
Plateau, and Dalboef, have excited much interest, and have led to the formation of
a new school of thought.

   I think it right to mention here specially the name of Professor Laycock, who

has done more, in my opinion, in this field of inquiry than any other member of the

medical profession of tliis coimtry in our time. His teaching has largely contri-
buted to our present humane methods of treating the insane ; he has attracted year
by year some of the best students of the University of Edinburgh to this important
dopai'tment of medical practice ; and his earher writmgs incontestibly show that

many years ago, and prior to most of the writings of those great men whose
names I have just enumerated, he not only recognized the value of physiological
research with regard to mental phenomena, but made important contributions

himself.

   Physiology lias thus encroached on psychology, and is attempting to supply from
the objective side an explanation of at least the simpler mental phenomena. As a
proof of awakened interest in this department, one of t])e features of the past year
has been the appearance of ' Mind,' a quarterly journal of psychology, edited by

my able friend Professor Groom Robertson of University Gollege. In the pro-

spectus of this journal it is .stated that "psychology, while drawing its fundamental
data from subjective consciousness, will be understood in the widest sense, as

covering all related lines of objective inquiry. Due prominence will be given to the

physiological investigation of nerve-structure." This quotation indicates the view
which the editor takes of the relation of the two sciences, and alread}' valuable
papers have appeared on subjects connected with physiological psychologj', from
the pens of Sully, Lewes, Wundt, and others.

   Now a certain class of thinkers are alarmed by work of this kind. They are

afraid of the tendency " to represent the mental fact as a physical fact," and they
are inclined to shut their eyes to the physical facts connected, undoubtedlj', with
psychological processes, and to be contented with the study of subjective pheno-
mena. But as most admit that there are two aspects in which mental phenomena
                                                                                                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                               135

may be viewed, why should not both be looked at carefully? If it be also

admitted that it is impossible to conuect any physical process (supposing we knew

it) occurring in brain-cells with an act of consciousness, what is the use of taking

Whya one-sided ^iew of the phenomena in question ?                                                       not study both sides of the

])roblem, and give up the attempt at reconciliation, which is entirely beyond the

pale of our faculties ? This mystery of mind and matter has puzzled thoughtful

men from the earliest times. Some have attempted a reconciliation. They have

leasoned in a circle, so that most people, after perusing tlieir works, are no nearer

Wean ultimate solution than they were at the beginning.                                                                                                                                                        always come back to

this view of the case, namely, that every fact of mind has two aspects, a physio-

logical and a psychological. That is one way of looking at the problem, and it is

tlio one which, in the present state of knowledge, personally I prefer. ]3ut there

is another. Thus, as has been well argued hj Mr. George Henry Lewes in his

recent work, ' Problems of Life and Mind,' two very diti'erent descriptions may be

given of one and the same mental activity. The one may be expressed in the

language of psychology, which is tb.e language we commoiJy use to describe our

feelings ; the other may be stated in the language of physiology, a language intel-

ligible only to those acquainted with the present state of physiological research.

lie says, " AU that we have to guard against is the tendency to mistake difference

of aspect for diflerence of process, and to suppose that changes in feeling can exist

independently of changes in the organism, or that any change in the organism can

be effected otherwise than by some previous change." This way of stating the

question may be more satisfactory to some minds. At all events it is a fair attempt

to solve the puzzle of our present state of existence, in which we are constantly

brought face to face with the antithesis of object and subject.

Abandoning these speculations, wliicli are fruitless in practical effects, let me now

endeavour very briefly to indicate the lines of inquiry in the domain of physiology

along which progress has been and may be made in the attempt to solve psycho-

logical phenomena                                                                                        and I wish it to be understood that I do not take these in any
                                                                                                      ;

mylogical order, but merely adduce them by way of illustration. It will also be

aim not so much to describe what has been done in the past, as to iridicate what

remains to be done in the future.

Ressakch in Physiological Psychology.

Fh'st of all, tlien, it is quite evident that all researches on the general physiology

of the great nerve-centres are of paramoimt importance. Such researches as those

of Hitzig, Fritsch, and Ferrier on the excitability of the cerebral hemispheres,

supplying new ideas regarding the mechanism of the bram as a compound organ
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

manner never before attempted, the phenomena of reflex excitation ; of ^^'iUiam

all recent important contributions to this department of science. Here, however,

we have to confess that we have little accurate information regarding the minute

structiu-e of the parts involved, and con.sequently no anatomical basis on which to

Wefoimd our views.                                                                                       have a general idea of strands of nerve-fibres iind groups of

nerve-cells of various forms, but we have no precise knowledge of the relative

quantity of these, or of the relation of one group of ner^e-cells to another group.

We are unacquainted with any peculiarity in structure, for example, by which even

an accomplished histologist could identify three microscopical sections as respec-

tively portions of the brain of a man, of a monkey, and of a sheep. All this has

still to be work out. Every little area of brain-matter has to be survej-ed and

carefidly described. Supposing this were done in the case of the human brain, and

of the brains of the higher animals, the same must be attempted witli the brainy

of animals lower in the scale. I can then conceive a grand collection of facts

which may throw light on the intricate working of different kinds of brains, and,

perhaps, afford a rational explanation of certain simple psychological characters.

Are we to rest satisfied by asserting that these pecidiarities are due to the action
of some kind of psycliical principle regarding which we know nothing ? I ha-.c

little doubt most will agree that these psychical characteristics of birds depend on

peculiarities of brain-structure the result of hereditary transmission through many

generations. If so, here we have an opportunity of examining tlie microscopical

structure of small brains, relatively simple, and easy of manipulation, with the view

of ascertaining whether or not thei'e are any structural differences which may ac-

comit for these differences in psychical character. This is a line of inquiry likely,

myill opinion, to establish an organic basis for a comparative psychology.

              Recent Rese.a.hches ox the Chemistry of the Bb.\in.

   But in studying the physiology of the brain as an organ of mind (and the same
holds good with regard to the other gre.at nerve-centres) we must not forget that,
in addition to mere structure, two other factors have to be taken into notice. These
are, first, the chemical constitution of the brain itself; and, second, the amoimt of
chemical interchange that goes on between it and the blood. There are so many
exceptions to the general ride, that size of brain and number of convolutions are

proportional to the degree of mental power, as to render it higlily probable that to

accoimt for these exceptions we must assume differences of minute structure,

differences of chemical constitution, and differences of chemical interchange between

blood and brain. That is to say, we may have two brains equal in size and in number
of convolutions belonging to two indi-\iduals very unequal in mental capacity. This
may be accounted for either by supposing that the minute structure of a convolu-
tion of the one may be more intricate than that of the otlier, or the one brain may

be richer in certain complicated chemical compounds, the splitting up of ^\]iicli into

simpler bodies is necessary in processes of thought ; or, finall}', the activity of che-

mical interchanges between the blood and the brain may be much more rapid in

the one than in the other. All this, however, must remain a matter of conjecture

rmtil we Imow more of the cliemistry of the brain than we at present do. I liave

 therefore hailed with satisfaction the appearance of an elaborate paper l)y Dr.
 Thudicum, entitled, '' Researches on the Chemical Constitution of the Brain," in
 a recent volume of ' Keports of the Medical OfHcer of tlie Vv\\y Council and Local
 Government Board.' It is impossible to gi-^-e here a detailed account of this labo-
 rious inquiry, in which Dr. Thudicum and his assistant, ]\Ir. C. T. Kingzett, ha^e
 analyzed the brains of oxen, requiring no fev.-er than a thousand of tliese in the
 undertaking. The result, generally speaking, has been the discovery of se^enteen
 compomids, for the first time detected as ingredients in brain-matter ; and in nn
 appendix, Dr. Thudicum gives a list of no fewer than eighty-two substances wj!i<'h

 have been detected, by himself and other chemists, in the brain. Even admitting,
 what is highly probable, that many of these are products of the decomposition of a
 few more complex substances, still we obtain from a mere inspection of this lif.t
 some idea of the intricate chemical nature of tliis part of our bodies.

    Various striking thoughts are put forth by Dr. Thudicum at the end of his paper,
 a few of which I may be allowed to refer to with the view of shoA\'ing how chemical
 considerations may assist us in our conceptions of the working of the ner^-ous svs-

 tem. He says, "During these in'oceedings the first striking fact which meets the

 inquirer is, that nerve-matter contains abundance of water. This, in conjunction
 with the peculiar manner in which the water is contained, engenders a mobility of

ultimate particles witliiti certain limits of movemeut. It alstj </i\c3 penetrability

by liquid diffusion, -while excluding- porosity and its capillary ellects, by -vvliich

means a ready nutrition by diffusion in one direction, and ready cleansing from the

effete crystaUizable products of life in another are assured. Consequently the brain

as a -whole is essentially made up of colloid matter, and may be compared to a

colloid septum, on the one side of -which is arterial hood and cerebro-spinal fluid of

the \ entricles ; on the other side, lio-weAer, is cerebro-spinal fluid of the arachnoideal
space and venous blood. It follo-ws from this that the large amount of -water pre-

sent in the brain is not there, so to say, mechanicallj' only, like water in a sponge,

and capable of being pressed out mechanically, but is chemically combined as colloid

hydration Avater, or, better, -v\-ater of coUoidation."

Dr. Thudicum divides a large amount of the matter occurring in the brain into

three groups, viz. phosphorized bodies, consisting of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen,

nitrogen, and rich in phosphorus; nitrogenized bodies', containing only carbon,

oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and no phosphorus ; and, third, oxygenized bodies,

formed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen alone. The phosphorized bodies he

divides into three subgroups, termed kephalines, myelines, and lecithiues. Each

--of these has certain definite chemical characteristics, -which he summarizes as
follo-«-s :                        " The kephalines possess the tendency to be oxydized,                                                                                           oxj^dizability                                                   the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

myelines are not easily changed by any agent or influence, and possess therefore

stability ; the lecithines easily fall to pieces, they are afflicted with lability."

   lie then points out the remarkable tendency of the phosphorized bodies to com-
bine with other substances, showing a diversity of affinities " not possessed by any

other class of chemical compounds in nature at present known." He shows th.at

these affinities are influenced by the amount of water present, and by the mass of

the substance or reagent presented to the bram-matter, so that the interchange " of

affinities may produce a perfectly incalculable number of states of the phosphorized,

quantitative chemical influence by reciprocal quality or quantity we may term the

state of hibt'/c equilibrium                                                                                           it foreshadows on the chemical                              outside  the  remarkable

   jVll of these remarks by Ur. Thudicum point to a field of research which will not
be explored for many a year to come. But there can be little doubt that when the

chemical statics of the brain have been accurately ascertained, we will be in a

position to studv the chemical interchanges between the blood and the nervous

tissue. Should the skill of our physiological chemists succeed in unravelling these,

then we will be in a position to understand at least two different sets of phenomena.

These are-- (1) the chemical changes which imdoubtedly take place during the

occurrence of mental phenomena                                                                                                                              and (2)  the exact nature of the action of such
                                                                                                                                                         ;

substances as alcohol, narcotics, and the various alkaloids which are kno-wu to act

on the nervous system. I need scarcely add that accurate knowledge regarding

the physiological action of these substances woidd probably be of great service in

the treatment of disease.

                                        Researchks on Sensohy iMpnr.ssiONs.

In the second place, researches into the physiology of the senses afford another

series of data for the physiologist. These researches may be said to be of three

--kinds (1) inquiries into the anatomical and physiological mechanism of the sense-

organ itself, such as, in the case of vision, the general structure of the eye

as an optical instrument, and its movements by the action of muscles, so

as to secure the conditions of monocular or binocular vision; (2) inquiries

into the nature of the specific action of the external stimulus upon the

--terminal organ of sense, and the transmission of tlie efi'ect to the brain as, for

example, the action of light on the retina, and transmission along the optic

nerve                              and  (3) experiments in                                                             which various                                 stinudi  are  permitted     to act imder

certain conditions on the terminal apparatus, and the result is observed and recorded

by the consciousness of the experimentaMst himself, as in researches on colour,

these three modes of inquiiy a large number of facts relating chiefly to the senses

of hearing and vision hare been collected ; and most of tliese facts, inasmucli as
they assist him in understanding the conditions of sensory impressions and sensa-
tional effects, are of importance to the psychologist.

              Measurement of TniE is Sensoby Imphessions.

The next step of importance made by physiology into the domains of psychology

is the measm-ement of time or dm-ation in sensational effects*. This has been

carefully measured by objective methods. Speaking generally, the time occupied

from the commencement of the action of the stimidus to the termination of a

sensation may be divided into four portions, each of which has a certain psycholo-

--gical interest : First, an interval of time is occupied by the primary physical change

produced by the stimulus. Duriug this interval, called the period of latent stimu-
lation, no effect is observed. Thus, when a motor nerve distributed to a muscle is

stimulated by a short electrical shock, about l-60th of a second passes before the
muscle contracts. Second, when the change in the nerve or terminal organ has

begim, a second interval of time is occupied in the transmission of the impression

to the nerve-centre, which is svicceeded by a third interval, dming which changes
occur in the nerve-centre, and the result of which is a sensation. The time occu-

pied in transmission, or the rate of conductivity in nerve, is tolerably well kuoTsni,

being at the rate of about 200 feet  per second  in  the nerves of  men                      but the time
                                                                                          ;

occupied in the production of the sensation in the centre has not yet been clearly

ascei-tained, owing to the difficulty of supposing such a sensory nerve-centre to be,

previous to the stimidus, in a state of absolute inaction. Lastly, it has been fomid

that when a neiTous action of any kind has been initiated by a stimulus, it goes on

for some time after the stimidus has ceased to act. This prolongation of the sen-

sation may be well studied in the case of impressions on the eye, where the time of

the duration of the impression has been measured by Ilelmholtz, Plateau, and

others. These distinguislied observers also found that the length of time occupied
by the after-effect varied according to the intensity of the light. Thus after a

Aweak light, the unchanged impression lasts longer than with a strong light.

strong illumination is followed by an after impression fading sooner than with a

--feeble stimulus the result being that, so far as the retina is concerned, it comes to

the same thing whether an intense light acts for a brief time, or a faint light for a

longer time.

                         Exhaustion or NER\rE on Sensory Organ,

   This line of research has also made it possible to measure the time required for
exhausting a nerve or sensory organ. When, for 'instance, a limited area of the

retina has been stimidated for a certain time, and the stimulus has been removed,
the after positive effect, due to increased excitation of the parts, disappears, and is
followed by a negative effect, due to temporary diminution of the sensioility of the
parts, in the form of what is called the negative after-image. Suppose, for ex-
ample, an area of the retina be acted upon for a period of from five to ten seconds,
and the stimulus be then removed, tne so-called positive after-image vaioishes
quickly, and the negative after-image, frequently ot a complementary colour to
that of the exciting cause, appears, and lasts for a short time, gradually fadmg

awav as the nervous parts recover from the effects of the stimulus. Similar pheno-
mena maj^ be observed in studying the durations of sensations of tone, which I
have frequently perceived in experiments made by myself; but it is more difficult
to ideutif}', by description and designation, the after-effects in the case of audition
than in the case of -s ision . Probably it may be found still more difficult to notice

these after sensations in the other senses, although in all there is often the experi-
ence of a lingering feeling after the cause has been removed, which no doubt has
its place in those transient sensations which assist in filling up the spaces, as it

were, in our conscious life,

    In experiments upon a sensory organ, such as the retiua, a little cousideralion

will sliow that it is almost impossible to ascertain the effect of a stimulus upon a
retina which has never before been affected. This difficulty has been felt by all
experimenters. Molecular action in such a structure has been in operation from
the very beginning:, and such action, if of sufficient intensity, must produce a cer-
tain effect on the conducting-tract and on the recipient centre. This effect, although
of too weak mtensity to produce those clianges which residt in consciousness, must
be taken into account in the measurement of the intensity and duration of sensory

impressions. Thus the eye has a light of its own due to changes in the retina,
although this may ne^er be conscious to us as a luminous impression. This con
ception of the state of matters in a terminal organ such as the retina, when applied

to actions going on in the brain, at once indicates that similar actions, or rather

that similar states of unrest, of change, variation, and moditication, are going on in

tliese deeper parts whicli may ne^er result in consciousness, per se, but which alto-
gether may have an inHuence on our mental existence comparable to that of tlie

feeble impressions constantly transmitted to the cerebrum from the viscera, some-

times termed the internal senses.

         Relation between Strength of Sensation and Magnitude op

                                                      Stimulus.

Having sho-s^ii that sensory impressions are distinctly related to time, the next

advance made by physiologists was to prove that there was a relation between the

.strength of the sensation and the magnitude of the stimulus, Here there are

Wedifficulties in explaining what is meant, because language fails.  have no words

to discriminate ideas which hitherto have related to two distinct fields of know-

--ledge the objective and the subjecti-\-e. To speak of the strength or magnitude

of a sensation seems to be using terms applicable only in another region, .and quite

inapplicable to psychological phenomena, although no one has any doubt in distin-

guishing the intensity or magnitude of one pain from that of another. There is no

Adifficulty in understanding the phrase-magnitude of the stimulus.   weight often

pounds is greater than that of one pound, light from ten candles of equal size is more

than that given out by one, and the tones of a \iolin of equal pitch and quality

may vary in intensity according to the pressure of the bow on the string. It is

mdifficult, however, to obtain an absolute measurement of variations sensation,

which is, of course, a subjective phenomenon. This can onlj'^ be done by varying

the objective cause, by observing a large number of instances, and by expressing

variations in the subjecti\-e phenomenon in terms applied to -(-ariations in the ob-

jective cause. If the average result obtained from a large number of instances

indicates any ratio between the magnitude of the stimulus and the subjective phe-

nomenon, then we may conclude that there is a relation between the two.

mThis mode of inquiry, first originated by Professor E. II. AVeber,      his cele-

brated experiments on tactile impressions (and which were first introduced to

notice in this coimtry by Professor AUen Thomson), was afterwards earned out by

his colleague Professor Fechner, and has been subsequently elaborated by Professor
Wundt. It has led to various remarkable results, the chief of which are (1)
that in the case of each sense there is an upper and a lower limit, beyond which

the amoiuit of stimulus produces no appreciable difference of effect ; and (2) that
within this range there is a definite ratio between the stimulus and the amoimt of
the sensation. The upper limit beyond which an increase of external stimulation

is not followed by any observable increase in sensational effect was first obsened
by Professor Wundt. The lower hmit has been noted by many observers, and it is
indicated in almost every physiological text-book. Now^ it does not matter much
to us, in taking a general view- of things, v>hat the hmits are, provided we are sure

thfit such limits exist, inasmuch as it indicates another element of proof that psycho-

logical plienomena, so far as seufation is concerned, occur within certain physical

limits.

         FeCHNEBS iNVESTIfiATIONS.

   The next step naturally was to establish the ratio between the magnitude of the
stimulus and the magnitude of the sensation. To do this directly is impossible, as
--140 REfORT 1876.

any estimation of the amount of sensational effect following a given stimulus would
probably be erroneous, because our percei^tions are usually qualitative and only
rarel}^, and never absolutely, quantitative. Fechner recognized this fact, and lie
employed for the solution of the problem various methods by which he measm'ed
not sensations themselves, but the amount of discriminati^·e sensibility between two
sensations produced by stimuli of unequal magnitudes, and he studied the ratio
between the difference of weight and the absolute quantity of the stimulation. By
varj'ing the amount of the stimulus in e\ery possible way, he eliminates the chances
of error, and arrived at definite results. These results he formulated into a general

" psychophysical law," Avhich may be expressed in \ arious ways. Mathematically
it may be put, that " sensation increases in proportion to the logarithm of the

stimulus." Now "logarithms increase in equal degrees when the numbers so in-

crease that the increment has always the same ratio to the magnitude of the num-
ber." It may be put in another way by saying that " the more intense a sensation
the greater must be the added or diminished force of stimulation in order that this
sensation undergo an appreciable change of intensity." The mode of arriving at
some of Fechner's residts may be better understood by an experiment which any

A Bone can repeat. In the case of muscular sensation, suppose two weights, and :

we wish to ascertain the least difference between these perceptible by the muscular
sense, say wlien we lift them in the hand. Let it be so arranged that both weiglits
are composed of difl'erent pieces, so that the one may be made less or more than

A Bthe other at pleasure. If and be nearly equal in absolute weight, the person

on whom the experiment is made sviW judge them to be of equal weight. Let

Aweights be now added to B until the difference between and B becomes percep-
Btible, and as a test, let the weights be again removed from until, in sensational
Aeffect, becomes again equal to B. Let the same experiment be repeated with

weights of different absolute amount, and it \\'ill be found that there is a distinct
ratio between the abs.dute weight and tlie weight that had to be added to it or
taken from it to produce tlie least perceptible difference of impression, whatever

these weights may be, up tj the limits, of cour.se, which I have already noticed. It

will always be found that the additional or subtracted weight is one third that of

--the absolute weight, a fraction which indicates the degree of intensity of the

stimulus required to produce the least perceptible feeling of difference of sensation,

and which may be termed the " constant proportional " of that kind of sensation.

This fraction, in the case of sensibility to temperature, Fechner found to be one

third Rentz, WoK, and Volkmann arrived at the same fraction -with regard to
                                     ;

auditory impressions ; and various observers have found that in visu.al impressions

it is one hundi'edth.

 Now --the intensity of sensation depends on two conditions : (1) the intensity of

the excitation ; and (2) the degree of excitability of the seusory organ at the mo-
ment of excitation. But suppose the excitability of the organ equal on two occa-

sions, the intensity of tlie sensation does not increase proportionately to the increase

of the excitation. That is to say, suppose we bring into a dark chamber a lumi-

--nous body such as a candle it produces a certain luminous sensation ; then intro-
--duce a second, third, and fourth the excitation is double, triple, or quadruple ; but

experiment shows that the increase in the amount of the sensation is much less
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

in others words, let the .stimulus increase from 10 to 100 time', and from 100 to
1000 times, the sensation will be oidy one, two, and three times stronger. The
impLirtance of the discovery of this remarkable law is, that it shows a distinct

matliematical relationship between stimulation and sensation. Possibly it may be

found to have applications to other psychological phenomena. .May it not vary in

different animals, and even in different iiidi\ iduals ^

                                Criticism of Fechner's Method.

   It is quite noticeable, however, that, in the case of each sense, the law did not
hold good throughout the whole range of variations in intensity of stimidus ; and
it is not surprising, when we consider the complexity of the onditions, that such
should be the case. All of these experiments were made in the case of visual im-
pressions, for example, on the li^ing eye, cjiinected by the optic nerve with the

brain; audit i« mauifestly impossible, fts has been remarked by Hermann, "to
localize this relationship between .sensational effect and variation in amount of
stimulus, which has been called the psycho-physical law of Fechner.*' Between
the sensational effect and the first contact of the stimulus there are a series of

complicated processes occurring; in retinn, nerve, and brain, processes undergoing;

incessant modification by the interchanges between these tissues and the warm

--circulating blood. In which of these does this relation between stimulus and con-

scious state occur in retina, in optic nerve, or in brain ? The only method of an-
swering this question, so far as I know, is to examine the effects of stimulation
upon these parts separately. It is manifestly next to impossible to do this in the
case of the optic nerve and the brain ; but by the method pursued by Holmgi-en in
Sweden, and by Professor Dewar and myself in this country, it can be done, so far
as the retina is concerned. In carrying out this method, Professor Dewar and I
found tliat light produced a change in the electrical condition of the retina in an
eye removed from the head or kept in normal conditions, and we ascertained that
the general phenomena of this change corresponded with our sensational experi-
ences of luminous impressions. AVe were therefore entitled to assume that the
change in the electrical conditions of the retina, produced by the action of light,
might be regarded as a phenomenon intimately related to those changes in the

brain which result in consciousness of a luminous impression. Consequently we

had an opportunity of ascertaining whether or not Fechner's law agreed with the

effects of a stimulus of light in altering the electrical condition of the retina, and we
foimd that it did so. The inference, therefore, is that the relation between degi'ee

or variation in stimulus and the corresponding sensation of a luminous impression

is a function of the sense-organ or retina.

                Mode of ina'estigatino the Sknsoiiy Organ it.sklf.

   I may here remark that this mode of inquiring into sensory impressions has by
no means been exhausted. The subjective method of observing sensational effect

under tlie stimulus of light from revolving disks, by the contrasting of colours, by
comparison of auditory sensations produced by tones of different intensity, pitch,

and quality, is always open to the charge that the results may not be due to specific

histological structure of the sense-organ, as is almost invariably assumed, but to the

structure of the recipient of impressions from the sense-organ, namely the brain. The
only way of proving that the effects are due to structural peculiarities of the sense-organ
is to examine the effects of stimiili applied to the sense-organ separated from the brain
by some method the same as or analogous to ours. If in these circumstances the
sense-organ gives results similar to those observed in the phenomena of conscious-

ness, then we may assume that these results are due to specific peculiarities of the

sense-organ, and not to the brain. If, on the other hand, the results do not agree,

then we must look in the brain for the mechanism by which these different re-

sidts are produced. Thus I have always held that, as there is little or no histolo-
gical evidence of complexity of structure in the retina capable of accounting for the
theory of Thomas Yomig regarding the perception of colours, or of the facts of

colour-blindness, or of the sensibility of different zones of the retina to lights of

different colours, we may have to loolc to the complex structure of the corpora

quadrigemina, cerebellum, or some portion of the cerebral hemispheres for an ex-

planation of these facts. It may be objected that such scepticism simply removes

the difficulty a little further back ; but I think it better to search for facts than to
be content with an hypothesis.

       OONCLVSION,

Time will ncit permit me to discuss other researches in this field of inquirj', nur

the interesting speculations which have sprung from them, biit I think I have said

enough to .show the line of advance in this direction.

True it is thnt apparently the physiological causation ipf many mental phenomena

may be, in its precise nature, inaccessible to direct proof ; but it is our duty as

physiologists to push legitimate research as far as it will go. I would remark also

tliat sucli researches are not incompatible "with those spu'itual ideas, matters of

faith and not of science, which are the basis of our most clierished hopes. They
demand, however, caution in the scrutiny of facts, and judgment in drawing con-
chisions from them. More than in any other kind of scientific labour, perhaps, it

--is of the utmost importance here to keep the mind unbiassed a task by no means

easy. To maintain a calm unprejudiced attitude to inquiries which seem to demand
a change of opinion regarding what was supposed to be final, requires an effort
which varies in different persons. Some find it comparatively easy to do so, while
others succeed only after a severe struggle. Still it is the state of mind which a
man true to science ought to aspire to, so that while he wiU not be blown about
by every wind of doctrine, he may be ready to accept what is apparently true when
he has had it clearly put before him.

   In conclusion, let me observe that it would sa\e not a little heart-burning, and

might possibly remote acrimony from ^·arious scientific and social controversies,

could we only remember that it is not ^^ery probable that we, in this nineteenth
century, have arrived at the final solution of many problems which have puzzled
wise men from the earhest times. Probably we ha^e got nearer the truth ; but it
is presumptuous to suppose that we have reached the ultimate truth. Many hypo-
theses much in favour at present ma}^ turn out to be inadequate. Still if they
serve as stepping-stones to somethmg better, and to more rational conceptions of
the mysterious phenomena about us, they will have done good service. In the
mean time it is our duty vigorously to prosecute research in all departments, push-

ing ahead fearlessly and with that enthusiasm which is the prime mover in all

great deeds, so that we may be able to transmit our depaitment of knowledge to
posterity not only less burdened with error, but with many additions of truth.

The genus Pandanvs (screw-pine) was shown to have a general distribution

throughout the tropics of the Old World, and to reach its western limit on the east

coast of Africa. It is very abundantly represented in the islands of the Indian

Ocean, and more especially in the Mascarene and Seychelles Islands.

   Altogether 19 species are deiinitelj' known from these islands ; and it is possible
that more may exist. Of these species Mauritius includes 11, which are all

endemic ; Heuniou has 3 peculiar species, and perhaps a fourth one may be recog-

nized                     in Rodriguez only two species,  both  endemic, are  found ;  whilst  the  Sey-
                       ;

chelles group possesses three such species. In addition to those which are endemic,

a Madagascar species, P. utilis, is generally cultivated for the sake of its leaves, and

P. odoratissimus, of Eastern origin, is also found.

having been made of the probably asexual Protophyta, Thwaites' ideutiiicatiou of
conjugation with reproduction proper, made in 1848, was meotioued, aud a sum-
mary given of the sexual classification of the Thallophytes proposed by Saclis
CLehrbuch, 4th edition) aud adopted by Professor Dyer (Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci.),
in which they are grouped asProtophyta, Zygospores, Oosporere, and Carposporese.
The types Pandonna, Mesocarpus, Spirogi/ru, and Podosplxpra were taken as indi-
cating sexual transition between these groups ; and Sachs" description of the essential
nature aud elements of sexual reproduction quoted. The difference between the
sexes as manifested previous to the formation of the elemental 'sperm' and 'germ'
cells was then traced in the various groups, 'being greater and manifested earlier in
the more highly organized groups.

    OEdoffonium, Vaiwheria, Phijcomi/ccs, Coleochate, and Nemalion were alluded to
in this connexion, and following the pedigree sketched by Sachs (Lehrbuch, 3rd
edition) the 'secondary sexual organs ' were traced through the Floridere to the
ancestral Cormophyte and to the ' heterosporous Pteridophyta,' near to which he
places the Cycadere, the lowest type of Phanerogam. The homology between the
sexual organs of Phanerogams and Cryptogams was pointed out, and Tlildebrand's
classification of the sexual arrangements explained.

    In this connexion the terms ' apertiflorous ' (open-flowered) in opposition to
' cleietogenous,' 'approximate,' and ' distant,' with anthers near to or remote from
the stigma, and ' homostylia,' were proposed by the author for adoption. It

was then attempted to br.se the phylogenetic arrangement of sexual forms (the
chief subject of the paper) on the law of economy of nutrition, the advan-
tageoupuess of cross-fertilization producing dioecism and various intermediate
stages from an original hermaphroditism. Dioecism was first traced through
monrecism aud moncecious polj-gamy, Frar/an'a, Pume.v, and a reverting sport of
Pet/onia fiigida being quoted. The dioecism of the English holly has probably
been reached from dioecious polygamy, as in the American forms, through an inter-
mediate monoecism ; and the monoeciously or trioeciously polygamous genus Cata-
setiim points to the origin of the latter form from the former probably through an

intermediate dioecious polygamy. Dioecism may possibly arise also from dimor-
phism, which may be monoecious, as in Dianthus carynphylhis and D. plumarius, or

dioecious, as in some Primulas.
    Dimorphism probably originates in ' biseriate ' stamens, tiimorphism in ' tri-

seriate ; ' but the dioecious dimorphism of Lythrum thyrsifolia would seem to arise

from trioecious trimorphism by suppression. Among the Compositre the transitions

are easy from the ' equal polygamy ' of Linnaeus, through ' superfluous polygamy,'
to ' frustraneous ' on the one hand and ' necessary ' on the other, from either of which

monoecism and dioecism may arise, as in Carduus arvensis, Petasites, and Antennaria,
The variety, increasing complexity, and homology of the sexual arrangements, the

abundant links, and the abhorrence of the sexual union of nearly related cells are
the theme of the whole paper.

   1st. Where the florets of the capitulum were replaced by stalked secondary

capitula, some of which were in turn again similarly compound. That the secondary
capitula really resulted from transformed florets was interestingly shown by the

presence on the stalk of many of the outer secondary capitula of a ligulate corolla

with its base embracing the aSis.

   2nd. "Where many of the florets of the ray presented a narrow ligulate lip directed
inwards, these internal lips conniving more or less over the central disk. At first

but so iiir as Dr. Dickson's examinations as yet went, it would appear that the
smaller lip Avas placed laterally to the normal line of non-union of the ligulate
corolla, and therefore was not a mesial structure compressed to the inner lip of the

floret in I>abiatiflorpe.

Oil tlie Occurrence in Ireland o/Nuphar intermedium, Ledeh,

                By A. G. More, F.L.S., M.R.I.A.

While staying with some friends at Orombyn, i)i West Meath, I noticed on the

borders of a sum 11 shallow lake, on peaty ground, some water-lily leaves which at

once drew attention from the small size of their leaves and especially with their

Mybasal lobes standing apart or widely apart.                                                                             friend Mr. Preston Battersby, of

the Royal Artillery, most kindly instituted a close search, and succeeded at last in

finding one blossom, from which, together with the leaves, I have been enabled to

identify the plant as Nuphar infcnnediimi, Ledeb., var. [i. Sjieimerianum, of Hart-

man's 10th edition of the ' Haudbok i Skandinaviens Flora' (Stockholm, 1870),

vol. i. p. 86.

   Our plant is also, I presume, identical with Dr. Syme's so-called variety "/3. minor''

On Circinnafe Vernation of Spheuopteris aflinis from the earliest stage to
   comjjletion, and on the discover^/ o/ Staphvloptcris, a Genus neiv to British

  Bodes. By C. W. Peach, A.L.S.

   The author stated that ho had found Spheuopteris affinis in black shale at West
Calder, near Edinburgh, in circinnate vernation from its earliest state to the com-
pletion of the plant, and thus had an opportunitj' of seeing this beautiful fern in
all its various stages of growth, showing the many variations it assumes and from
which, when so found, uo doubt several species have been made.

   It is rather plentiful at West Calder, Slateford, Burdie House, Burnt Island, and

other places around Edinljurgh ; he, however, had not found it in circinnate verna-
tion in any other locality than the first mentioned.

  He next exhibited and described specimens of Sfaphj/hpte7-is, also from West
Calder, and said the plant was a new genus to British rocks ; that he had met with

it first sparingly in 1n74, and in the present year in some abundance there,
especially in one slali. It is something like Stap)hijIopteris Wortheni of Leo
Lesquereux, figured in vol. iv. of the Geological Survey of Illinois, from "the shale
of the subconglomerate coal of Arkansas :" it, however, differed from that species,
first, in not showing like a star around a central point ; in having uo sporanges

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and the flower-like parts instead of only " apparenthj restinej o«," are actually attached

in pairs, hanging in a drooping manner, to small branches. As well as the
one mentioned, he strongly suspected that he has another species from the same

locality. Several species have been found in the rocks of Arkansas ; all, however,
difi'er from the British one.

   The author expressed his obligations to Mr. R. Etheridge, jun., for first calling

state that -wherever he foimd iSfapJii/lopferis, the Sphenopteris (iffinis more or less

of the Geological Survey and by Mr. D. J. Brown at Straition, all near Ediubm-gh,

  0)1 some of the PJiysiolor/ical and Morphological -Features seen in the Plants

        of the Coal-Measures. By Profes.sor W. C. Williamson, F.It.S.

    Proceeding from the starting point of the facts recorded in the comnmnicatiou
made to the Geological Section*, the author brought before the Biological Section

some morphological facts. He showed that even in young twigs of Lepidoclendron

--the bark consisted of three very distinct layers, viz : an inner parenchyma, a

middle proseuchyma of cousidercable proportionate thiclmess, and an outer paren-
chyma of which the leaves were expansions. The innermost portion, the inner
parenchyma, certainly represents a plane of genetic activity, along which the

multiplying cells add new laj'ers of vessels to the exterior of the vascular cylinder
on its inner surface, as it apparently increases as the number of pareuchymatoua
cells in the opposite directions. Externally to this parenchyma is the ])rosenchy-
matous layer, into which the inner parenchyma passes somewhat gradually, but

Avhich outwardly becomes a modified mass of prosenchymatous fibre, composed of
very long and narrow prismatic cells. At the first glance this layer looks like a
phellem or corky layer, but its origin is a different one. Its genetic plane is at its
outer surface, instead of occupying the position of the phellugeu of living barks.
The cells at this point become elongated radially into long fusiform ones, which soon
become subdivided by a regular series of vertical cell-walls, all of which are parallel
to each other and to the external surface of the stem. Subsequently each one of
these parallel cells becomes irregularly subdivided into a cluster of cells, the
partitions of which are vertical to the primarj^ series. In this manner, apparently,
additions are made on tlie inner side to the prosenchymatous layer, and on the outer
one to the subepidermal parenchyma. It thus becomes evident that the bark of
each of the Lepidodendroid stems possesses two parallel planes of genetic activity.

    It is obvious that Calainites certainty possesses the innermost of these genetic
planes ; and as the author's arborescent specimen exhibits no indication that the
second or prosenchymatous laj'cr has been increased from within, it becomes more

than probable that when yet more perfect specimens are discovered the second or
outer genetic plane will be found to be identical in all respects with what ia seen

in the Lepidodendra.

   The author concluded by calling attention to the fact that amongst a large number
of the coal plants their most specialized and characteristic type features were best
seen in their young state, the advance from youth to maturity being one from specia-
lized to generalized forms, the result of which was, that the author found it almost
impossible to identify detached fragments of wood or bark, and hence he regarded
all attempts to establish genera and species upon such fragments as absurd.

On 6i(jantic Land-Tortoises and a Freshwater Species from the Maltese
   Caverns, with observations on tlicir Fossil F'auna. By A. Leith ADiMS,

   F.li.S., Professor of Zoology, Royal Colleye of Science, Biihlin.

   The author exhibited and made a few observations on bones of gigantic toitoisea
collected by Admiral Spratt and himself in the Maltese Caverns.

   During the five years he was engaged in exploring the rock-cavities of Malta,

                                                          * Svpra, p. 98.
146 REPORT--1876.

among other fossil remains, lie discovered several fragments of bones of gigantic

Chelonians, one of whicli rivalled in dimensions any of the recent or extinct species

hitherto reported from the Mascarene and Galapagos Islands. The remains were

found in conjunction -with hones and teeth of the dwarf elephants and gigantic

dormice ; and whilst remains of the Prohoscidians and Rodents were extremely

abundant in certain rock-cavities he examined, and the Chelonians were also well

represented, it was a noteworthy fact that no traces of large Carnivora were met

with. This absence of the order, excepting the tooth of a small Cams, he supposed

accounted for the presence of the large helpless tortoises, as obtained also in the

Galapagos and Mascarene Islands.

The largest of the Chelonians rivalled in dimensions the Testiido elephant opus

and Testiido ephippium, and showed some affinities with the latter, but was generally

distinguishable from any recorded species from these islands by a marked robustness

Aof the bones ; on which account he proposes to name it Testiido rohusta.  smaller

species, distinguishable also, morphologically, from the preceding, he proposes to

name after Admiral Spratt ; whilst a few bones of a small freshwater tortoise were

indistinguishable from the same parts of the Lvtremys et/ropera, which is still not

uncommon in the south of Europe and in certain islands of the Mediterranean.

The author was inclined to believe that the Maltese-cavern fauna belonged to a

late Pliocene rather than a Pleistocene period, such as that exhibited by the Sicilian

caverns, to wit, the Caves of Palermo ; and that, although the Hippopotamus Pent-

landi and smaller forms are both represented in Malta, Sicily, and Crete, the absence

of traces of the dwarf elephants and gigantic dormouse in the two latter situations,

and the presence of the Hi/eena crocuta, Elephas aiitiquus, and large Felidee in Sicily,

seem to point to faunas of two diflerent epochs. Indeed, in the case of the Maltese

deposits, it would appear, in some instances at all events, that the animal remains
of the fissures had been derived from older beds which were broken up during the

submergence of the area. Eut as the Maltese rocks were Miocene and the upper-

most had been supposed to indicate the presence of Pliocene Invertebrata, it was
clear that the red soil and clay which formed the matrix in which the above animal

remains were found, in the rock rents, could not be more ancient than a later

Pliocene.

  He strongly advocated further explorations of the islands of the Mediten-anean
in quest of fossil remains, and stated that tliere was still much to be done in Malta.

   On the Development of the Proto-Vertebrce in Elasmohranchs.
By F. M. Balfour, B.A., Fdloiu of Trinity College, Cambridge.

Tlie mesoblast in Elasmohranchs arises as two independent plates, each of which

becomes divided into two layers, a somatic and a splanchnic. In the dorsal part

of each plate a series of transverse slits arises, which serves to distinguish a dorsal or
Avertebral portion of the plate from a ventral or parietal.
                                                             cavity is next formed

between the two layers of the plate, which is continued quite to the summit of the

vertebral part. Still later the segmented vertebral part of each plate, with its en-
closed cavity, becomes separated from the parietal part and forms the muscle-plates.
Each of these is a somewhat rectangular body, formed of two layers, enclosing
between them part of the original body-cavity. The inner of these two layers soon

buds off cells to form the rudiments of the vertebral bodies, and itself is trans-

formed into longitudinal muscles ; the outer layer of the muscle-plate becomes con-

verted into muscles at a considerably later period.

On the Changes in the Circulation ivhich are induced when the Blood is expelled
  from, the Limbs by Esmarch's Method. By H. G. Brooke, B.A. (Lond.),

   and E. 0. Hopavood, BA. (Oxon).

   The authors stated that the object of the experiments was to observe the pulse
dm-ing and after the expulsion of 'blood from the limbs. Healthy young men were
experimented on, and the experiments were made one or two hours after a light
meal. The pulse was counted with the aid of a watch, and its form recorded by
means of the sphygmograph. The person experimented on was stripped and recum-
bent. Normal pulse-rate and sphygmographic movements were recorded ; and
afterwards one leg was bandaged from below upwards. During bandaging, pulse-
rate was observed, and immediately bandaging was complete further sphygmo-
gi-aphic tracings were taken. This was repeated with the other leg. After a short
time both bandages were suddenly let go, and at the same instant pulse-rate and
ephygmographic movements were again recorded.

1-15  REPORT 1870.

   As the result of their observations, the authors state that
   1. During bandaging of the tirst lower limb, the pulse-rate increases, and after-

wards (generally after a very short interval) falls to about the normal.
   2. Dm-ing bandaging of the second lower limb, the pulse again quickens its pace,

returuin"- almost to the normal, but sometimes remaining a fevv beats above the

normal.

   3. When both bandages are suddenly let go, there is at once a marked

acceleration of pulse-rate, but of brief duration.

   The authors point out the changes which bandaging and uubaudagiug must have
upon the disposition of the blood in the circulating system. Thus, on bandaging,
the arterial blood is di-iven from the limbs bandaged into the arterial system of the
trunk, head and neck, and upper extremities, raising the pressiu-e all over the system
while the venous blood, together with the lymph, are also driven into the rest of
the body from the compressed limbs, but arc only able to aflect the pressure in the
trunk, iiead, and neclc, being excluded by valves from the upper extremities.
Hence the general venous pressure will have a relatively larger increase than the

general arterial pressure.

   Ao-ain, on imbandaging, the arterial blood rushes down the lower limbs to fill

the previously obliterated vessels, thus diminishing the general pressure of the
arterial system; while no such reflux of the venous blood is possible on account of
tlie interposed valves of the veins. Jlence, while the arterial pressure is diminished

suddenly, the venous remains, for the moment, as it was ; that is to say, the general
venous " pressure will experience a relatively less diminution than the general

arterial pressure.

   Now, comparing the conditions on bandaging and imbandaging, it will be seen

 that, in both cases, the relative difference normoUji existitig heticeen arterial (aid venous

pressitres on the two sides of the heart is diminished, on bandaging by approximating
the venous to the arterial pressure, on uubandaging by approximating the arterial

to the venous pressure. May we not, the authors suggest, seek in this coincidence

of conditions an explanation of the somewhat imexpected similarity of effect on
bandaging the lower limbs and on loosing the bandages ?

    In the course of the discussion which followed, Professor Kronecker, of Leipzig,
pointed out that the addition of a large quantity of lymph to the blood on
 bandaging, by altering the composition of the blood, might well be supposed to

aflect the heart's rate, since the heart is now known to be very sensitive to qualita-

 tive changes in the iluids bathing it.

       On the Morphologival Belations of the Lower End of the Humerus.
                         By Professor Cleland, M.D., FJi.S.

   In this communication it was pointed out that the torsion of the humerus spoken
of by more than one writer has no existence in nature, and that the limb is deve-
loped in its morphological position. While the radius is morphologically anterior
to the ulna, the anterior, posterior, external, and internal aspects of the humerus
have morphological relations exactly corresponding with those names, so that the
flattening of the lower end of the humerus is not a commencement of the expansiou
which results in two bones in the forearm. The radius does not belong to the outer
side of the humerus, nor the ulna to the inner side ; but the radius is in front of
the humerus, the ulna behind it, and the limb is in its morphological position when

the forearm is in .semipronation.

At the outset of my invesiigations into the anatomy of the spinal nervous system

of the Cetacea, I endeavoured to discover whether any anatomist had described the

arrangement of these nerves. This was no easy matter, so little had been written
on the subject. H. liapp (' Die Cetaceen,' Stuttgart, 1837) states that, " with respect

to the course of the spinal nerves (of the Cetacea) there are no researches ;" and

ytannius ('Lehrbnch der Vergleichenden Anatomic,' Zweiten Theil, 18-J(>, p. 393)

simply mentions that "in the Dolphin a nerve-trunk proceeds out of the lumbar

plexus, the branches of which are intended for the muscles of the rudimentary

pelvis, and for the external genital organs aiid their muscles, as well as for the

region of the anus." Indeed it was not until I had finislied my investigation that

.1 discovered that Swan, in the " Table of Contents " or Introduction to his work
upon the ' Comparative Anatomy of the Nervous System,' published in 1835,

however, that besides extending liis account very materially, I am able to give

myadditional results ; and I have taken care to have all                                                                          dissections illustrated by

drawings, whilst he, with his wealth of plates of the nervous system of other ani-

mals, does not give one of the nervous system of the Cetacea.

1 may mention that the following results are derived from the dissection of four

members of the Cetacean group, viz. three porpoises and one dolphin*.

  --Spinal Cord. The spinal cord is surrounded and supported on all sides by the

d^mse rete mirabile, which may be looked upon as performing a threefold function :

(1) it constitutes a soft pliable packing material, by means of whicli tlie cord is

protected from shocks                                                                                      (2)  it  maintains  a  uniform warmth  around this  important
                                                                                                        ;

and delicate nervous centre by keeping it constantlj' bathed, as it were, in warm

arterial blood (3) and lastly, as Professor Turner has pointed out (Trans. Roy.
                                                                   ;

Soc. Edinb. vol. xxvi. p. 233), it subdivides the arterial stream^ and equalizes its

force before it reaches the brain and spinal cord.

   In the porpoise the spinal cord extends from the margin of the foramen magnum

to a point corresponding to the interval betw^-en the 6th and 7th lumbo-caudal

vertebra^, and opposite to the foramina of exit of the 27th pair of spinal nerves. It

--presents two enlargements one in the cervical, and the other iu the lumbar region.

The former of these is connected v,ith the nerves which go to form the cervical and

brachial plexuses, and the latter with the nerves which supply the genital organs

and the muscular apparatus of the tail. Between these enlargements the cord is

of uniform diameter, and the lumbar swelling tapers away in a fusiform manner

--into the filum terminale.
   Boots of the Spinal Nerves. The direction and length of the nerve-roots and the
size and position of the ganglia vary in the dift'erent regions of the spine.

The nerve-roots which proceed from the cervical and luiubar enlargements of

the cord are closely crowded togetlier, whilst iu the dorsal region they are placed

at considerable intervals from each other. Those arising from the lumbar swelling

are very long, tortuous, or curly, loosely bound together by lax connective tissue,

and they constitute the cauda equina. Tliey pass directly backwards to reach

their respective foramina of exit. The dorsal and cervical nerve-roots are much

shorter, and the former are directed outwards and backwards, whilst the latter,

with the exception of the first three which pass directly outwards, take a course

outwards and forwards.

  --In all the regions the superior nerve-roots are smaller than the inferior thus

constituting a marked contrast to most mammals, in which tlie reverse of this

arrangement holds good. Nowhere, however, is this diti'erence in size so marked

as in the cauda equina, iu the last nerves of which the superior root is half the size

--150 REPORT 1876.

of the inferior, aud in some places so delicate that when stripped of the loose con-

nective tissue which surrounds it, it resembles (in the porpoise) a fine thread or

hair. From this fact we must not conclude that sentiency is dull in the Cetacea,

for as the animal tapers towards the tail, the amount of skin to be supplied with

sentient fibres is small in comparison to the huge muscular masses to oe supplied

with motor filaments. In the cervical, dorsal, and upper lumbar regions, where the

cutaneous surface is extensive, the superior roots attain a size only slightly smaller

than the inferior roots.

 --Spinal Nerves. In the lumbo-caudal region of the vertebral column of a porpoise

or other_ cetacean, the intervertebral foramina correspond to the intervals between

the laminte of contiguous vertebra, and consequently lie on a higher horizontal

plane than the transverse processes. As we approach the dorsal region, however,

a rudimentary pedicle begins to show itself, and this becomes more and more

marked as we pass on towards the cervical region. In the cervical and dorsal

regions, therefore, the intervertebral foramina occupy a more ventral plane, being

situated between the pedicles and inferior to the transverse processes. It follows

from this that the removal of the great extensor muscle in the lunibo-caudal

region displays the whole spinal nerve issuing from the spinal canal, whilst in the

dorsal aud cervical regions it only exposes the superior divisions of these nerves

--passing upwards between the pedicles.
    Cervical Nerves. These are eight in number, aud, owiug to the fusion or close

opposition of the vertebra in this region, they are closely crowded together. Each

nerve divides into a superior and inferior division. The superior divisions supply

the muscle and skin on the superior aspect of the neck, and are in some cases (e. g.
dolphin) joined together by communicating branches which lie close to the vertebrte.

The first three of the inferior divisions join together, so as to form a cervical plexus,

whilst the remaining five, together with the tu-st dorsal nerve, and in some cases a

small twig from the second dorsal nerve, enter into the formation of the branchial

plexus. The chief branches of the branchial plexus are those which correspond

to the musculo-spiral, median, and ulnar nerves in man. There is no circumflex

uerve.

 --Dorsal Nerves. The superior divisions of these nerves join together in a plexi-

forni manner. Well-marked communicating branches pass betweeu the various

Asuperior trunks, aud connect them with each other.                                     longitudinal cord or plexus

is consequently formed. The distribution of the inferior divisions is similar to that

--of the same nerves in other mammals.
   Lumho-caudal Nerves. The arrangement of the spinal nerves posterior to the

dorsal region is diflereut from that of any other group of mammals (excepting

perhaps the Sirenia) witli which I am acquainted. The final cause of this is

obvious                                 it  is an  adaptation  of the  nervous  system  to  suit peculiarities  in  the
                                     ;

muscular construction of these animals. In other mammals powerful inferior ex-

tremities are developed for the purpose of locomotion, and consequently the inferior

divisions of the lumbar aud sacral nerves are large as compared v/ith the superior

divisions, aud they are thrown into plexuses to supply the muscles which act upon

these limbs. In the Cetacea, on the other hand, lower limbs are absent so liir as

locomotion is concerned. The tail is the great organ of progression, and the muscles

which work it are developed equally above aud below the transverse processes of

the vertebral column. In consequence of this, the superior divisions of the spinal

nerves have as important a part to play in the supply of the muscles of the chief

organ of locomotion as the inferior, seeing that it falls to them to give branches to

the extensor muscles, whilst the latter have as their office the supply of the flexor

muscles. The result of this is, that the superior and inferior divisions of the

lumbo-caudal nerves in the Cetacea are very nearly of equal size. To insure the

proper nervous supply of the four great muwnilar masses which work the tail, two

--great longitudinal cords or trunks are formed by the spinal nerves on each side of

the vertebral columu one superior, and formed by the jimction of the various

.superior divisions, and the other inferior, and formed by the union of the inferior

divisions. The first of these commences towards the middle of the dorsal region
                                            _;

but even in the cervical region a tendency to a similar arrangement is exhibited.

The inferior longitudinal cord begins further back, at a point corresponding to th»

eleventh lumbo-caudal vertebra. Posterior to this point, therefore, we have arrsinged

--around the vertebral column four great nervous cords two of which are superior,

and situated one on each side of the A'ertebral spines, and two inferior, and placed
one on each side of the vertebral bodies below tne transverse processes. They are
continued back to the tail, and their chief function is to supply the four great
muscles which act on the tail. Sensory filaments, however, are also given to the

fekin.

   The first eleven of the inferior divisions of the lumbo-caudal nerves do not enter
into the formation of the great inlVrior cord. They correspond to the lumbar and
sacral nerves in man. The large internal pudic nerve takes origin from the more

posterior of these.

On the Action of Vanadium upon the Intrinsic Nervous Meclianism of the
  Frog's Heart. By Prof. Aethuk Gamgee, F.R.S., and Leopold Laemuth.

  \Method of Experiment.-- frog's heart was ai-ranged with an artificial circula-

tion, the blood (i. e. rabbit's seruni) passing from a reservoir of given height through
the auricles, ventricle, and bulhus aurice, and being allowed to trickle back into the

reservoir down the sides of a glass rod, so as to be exposed iu a thin him to the air.
In the course of this artificial circulation a mercurial hsemodynamometer was inter-
posed, arranged so as to record its movements on a blackened cylinder. Before

taking a tracing the outlet of the blood from the circulating system back into the
reservoir was obstructed, thus causing the mercury in the distal manometric limb
to rise and oscillate. Normal tracings were first taken ; then the serum was
mixed with a solution of a sodium salt of vanadium (NaVOj, or Na^V.^O., or Xa,

VO4), and other tracings taken at intervals. When the effects of vanadium-poison-

ing were well advanced the vagus nerve was stimulated in certain cases and the
eflects noted. In other cases atropin-poisoning was induced prior to mixing the

--serum with the salt of vanadic acid.
    Besidts of Experiments. "When vanadized serum flows through a beating frog's
heart (being present iu a proportion of -098 per cent, of V.^Oj the force of ventri-
cular systole is much diminished, the ventricle passes into persistent contraction
for a time, while the auricles pulsate as usual or somewhat enfeebled. If the pro-
portion of vanadium were twice as large, the ventricle stops writhing one or two
minutes in a state of rigid contraction, in which it continues for a long time, often,
however, relaxing again before death.

   When so contracted, excitation of vagus, sufficient to stop the auricles, has no

 effect on the ventricle.

    The previous administration of atropia does not iu the slightest modify the above

 results.

 On the Difference in the Poisonous Activity of Phos2)horus in Ortho-, Meta~, and

   Pyrophosphoric Acids. By Prof. Arthur Gamgee, F.E.S., John PRiESTLEi',

    and Leopold Larmuxh.

    In their experiments the authors made use of frogs, rabbits, and dogs ; and the
 sodium salts of the phosphorus acids investigated were introduced into the system
either subcutaneously or by venous injection. The salts used were trisodic ortho-

phosphate, tetrasodic pyrophosphate, and sodic metaphosphate, the standard solu-
·tions being made to contain the same amount of phosphorus calculated as P.fly

    As the result of then' experiments the authors state ;
    1. That trisodic orthophosphate is physiologically inactive.
    2. That sodic metaphosphate is a poisonous substance, but not so poisonous as

 pyrophosphate of sodium.

   3. That tetrasodic pj-ropliospliate is a body of great poisouous activity, inducing

death without materially affecting the irritability of voluntary muscles or of nerves.
It exerts an action on the spinal cord and medulla oblongata not unlike that exer-

ted by sodium salts of vauadic acid. On the heart its action is similar to that of
salts of vanadic acid. On general nutrition and on the alimentary canal (when
any action resulted) the effects were like those of poisoning by phosphorus, viz.

fiitty degeneration of kidneys, muscular tissue of heart and oi' liver on the one
hand, and hcemorrhagic infarctions and brown patchy congestion of the alimentary

mucous membranes. When introduced into the alimentary canal fatal results

never followed, this being probably due to rapid elimination.

seconds after injection of the drug, viz. ( 1) a fall iu blood-pressiu-e and ('2) a marked

On the Brain of the Canidte. By Egbert Garner, F.L.S., F.Ii.C.S,

The author infers, drawing his conclusions from the measurements of the capacity

and from casts of the interior of the skulls of different dogs, that the size of the

brain does not very closely correspond with the size of the animal. He is also

disposed to argue for the derivation of our domestic dogs from one or more wild

dogs ; but of the more remote origin of the latter he does not propose to treat.

From the table it will be seen that no dog has so large a brain as the wolf, or one

so small as the jackal, from both which animals he has been supposed to have been

domesticated ; his brain seems specitic in size. Though Mr. Darwin has shown

that the hirge tame rabbit has a smaller brain than the wild one, yet we could hardly

suppose that the dog, if he were a domesticated wolf, would have his brain so dimi-

nished, the circumstances of the two cases difl'ering very widely. For similar

reasons, if cither the wolf or the jackal must be assigned as the source of the

domestic dog, perhaps preference must be given to the latter. Little account need

be taken of the likeness often seen between these different animals, or of the simi-

larity of the cerebral folds, any more than of the corresponding circumstances in

the Fehdte.

Though neither the size of the brain nor the intelligence of the dog increase in

the exact ratio of the size of the body, yet the two former seem to correspond

better to each other. Li large dogs the skull, as a whole, rather than its brain-

cavity increases, and this for muscular attachment, size of teeth, &c. But it is not

easy to advance further and connect the various powers of dogs with any pecu-

liarity of brain organization. Li dogs with line scent, as the hound, the "rhinou-

cephalon is elongated or cnlnrged and the whole brain also lengthened, and this

throws back the three arched folds which are situated over the lissure of Sylvius
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

transverse sulcus, as well as in the hog, sheep, and horse, but little developed in the

cat, where smell is less acute ; in the sheep it is covered with pigment like the

olfactory nerve, and it appears to be the terminus of the inner root of the nerve.

The above description comprises most of what is seen on the surface of the brain,

and the elongated and simple folds, of which, however, the upper one is bifurcated

before and behind, somewhat correspond with Mr. Swan's later dissections, obscure

bounded in front by the transverse or crucial sulcus, also fonninn;- behind an
occipital portion lyinj^- under the supraoccipital lamina. In these different convo-
lutions there are certainly minor variations in different dogs.

   When we see that the brain of the dog is no larger and not more convoluted

than that of the sheep, we must infer that he owes his sagacity in a great measure

to the training and companionship of his master. But no doubt he had its germs
by nature, together with fine scent, fleetness, watchfulness, and hunting propen-
sities ; he hence became, as Cuvier expresses it, " la conquete la plus complete, la
plus singuliere et la plus utile que I'homme ait faite."

   In the Table several of the above facts will be manifest ; for inst.ance, the New-
foundland dog, thovigh it was so sagacious as to rescue a drowning man at Southport,

and though the weight of its body would have been four or five times as mucli as
that of one of the small terriers, had its brain only about one fifth larger than

these last.

   The capacities of the skulls were ascertained by measuring the interiors by
means of sand, and reducing to the equivalents of the natural contents.

On the Dynamics of the Racial Diet in India. By Surgeon-Major Jonssxox.

                            On tlie Action of Alcohol on the Brain.

           By Chakles Thomas Kingzett, F.G.S. London and Berlin,

   The question of what becomes of alcohol taken into the system has been exteu-

si^ely studied.

   Thudichum was the first to determine quantitatively the amount of alcohol
eliminated by the kidneys from a given quantity of alcohol administered, and the
result -which he obtained was sufficient in itself to disprove the " elimination "

theory at that time widely prevailing.

   Dupre and many others continued these reseai'ches, from which, to use Dupre's
own words, we may fairly draw three conclusions (see ' Practitioner/ March 1872,
being abstract of a paper communicated to the Royal Society) :

   (1) The amount of alcohol eliminated per day does not increase with the con-
tinuance of the alcoholic diet ; therefore all the alcohol consumed daily must of
necessity be disposed of daily ; and as it is certainly not eliminated within that
time, it must be destroj-ed in the system.

    (2) The elimination of alcohol following the taking of a dose of alcohol is com-

pleted twenty-fom' hours after the last dose of alcohol has been taken.

    (3) The amount eliminated in both breath and urine is a minute fraction only of
the amount of alcohol taken.

   Now Dr. J. Percy in 1830 published a research on the presence of alcohol in the

ventricles of the brain, and, indeed, he concluded " that a kind of affinity existed

between the alcohol and the cerebral matter." He further stated that he was able
to procure a much larger proportion of alcohol from the brain than from a greater

quantity of blood than could possibly be present within the cranium of the animal
upon which he operated.

    Dr. Marcet, in a paper read before the British Association in 1859, detailed
physiological experiments which he considered to substantiate the conclusions of
Percy, inasmuch as they demonsti-ated that the alcohol acted by means of absorp-
tion on the nervous centres.

    Lallemand, Perrin, and Dure)' had moreover succeeded previously in extracting
alcohol from brain-matter in cases of alcoholic poisoning. But all these researches
leave us entirely in the dark as regards the true action, if any there be, of alcohol

on cerebral matters. And no method of investigation was possible vmtil the

chemical constitution of the brain was within our knowledge.
    Thudichum's recent researches in this direction, together with some more recent

and published investigations by Thudichum and the author, have placed within

reach new methods of inquiry regarding the action of alcohol on the brain. In my

research I have attempted this inquiry, by maintaining the brains of oxen at the
temperature of the blood in water or in water containing known amounts of
alcoliol. The extracts thus obtained have been studied in various ways and sub-
mitted to quantitative analysis, while the influences exerted by the various fluids
on the brains have been likewise studied. These influences extend in certain cases
to hardening, and to an alteration in the specific gravity of the brain-matter.

   Here I shall simply state in the fewest words my results and the conclusions to

which they lead.
    Water itself has a strong action upon brain-matter (after death), for it is capable

ciple insoluble in strong- alcoliol, together with that class of suDstances generally

termed extractives. At the same time the brain swells and attains a smaller

specific gTavity : thus in one case from lO.'iO it became 1007. It is notable that

water, however, dissolves no kephaline (C^jIT^gNPOij) from the brain.

Alcohol seems to have no more chemical effect on the brain than water itself, so

long as its proportion to the total volume of fluid does not exceed a given extent.

The limit would  appear  to  exist      somewhere                                                                                                                                                                                                 near  a  fluid  containing  35          alcohol.

is to say, not merely by the loss of substance and swelling, but by the fixation of

waier. Many difficulties surround the attempt to follow these ideas into life, and

to comprehend in what way each or all these modes of action of water and alcohol

on the brain may be iutiueneed by the other matters present in blood. From

Thudichuni's researches it follows that the brain must be subject to every influence

afTecting the blood ; and it is probable, on consideration, that what is written above

regarding the action of water on the brain is likewise true of an extraordinary

watery serum in life. But if the serum be rich in salts, those salts, by a power of

combination which they have for the cerebral principles, would preserve the inte-

grity of the latter. On the other hand it is difficult to see how any of the matters

known to exist in the blood could prevent alcohol, if it were present in sufficient

amount, either from hardening the brain (as it does after death) or from dissolving

traces of the principles to be henceforth carried away in the circulation. That is

to say, should physiological research confirm the stated fact that the brain in life

absorbs alcohol and retains it, it would almost follow of necessity that the alcohol

would act as I have indicated and produce disease, perhaps "delirium tremens."

Note on the Physiohyical Action of Vanadium. By John Priestley.

The author described the methods of experiment and observation followed out

in a research into the physiological action of vanadium, and concluded by stating

the general results arrived at, viz. :

1. That vanadium is a poisonous substance.

2. That the symptoms of poisoning are, in general, similar whatever the method

of the introduction of the salt into the animal system.

3. That the symptoms of poisoning which appeared in one or other of the various

--classes of animals above mentioned are :  paralysis of motion                                                                                                                                                                                                   convulsions, local or

respiration, and. coincidently, a fall in temperature ; drowsiness and feebleness of

pulse. In addition, the heart was always irritable after death, consciousness and

sensibility to pain seemed unimpaired, and no diminution could be detected in the

powers of muscle and nerve to respond to stimulation.

5. That the special action of vanadium on the function of respiration is to cause

         A(a) stimulation, followed by
         A{b) depression of respiration, the latter being not continuous, but

    intermittent.

Both effects are considered to be due to an action of the poison upon the respi-

ratory nervous centre.

0. That the special action of vanadium on the function of circulation is to cause

         A(ff) diminution of blood-pressure, which is not continuous, but inter-

    mits during the operation of the poison        ;

A(b) disappearance of I'espiration-curves
    A;

(c) diminution and irregularity of pulse, which is also intermittent.

The results are considered to be due to an action of the poison on the vaso-motor

centre and on the intracardiac nervous mechanism.

7. That, although muscles and nerve-trunks speedily die when immersed in even

dilute solutions of a sodium salt of vanadium, yet vanadium is not rightly to be

called a muscle- and nerve-poison, since frogs which have been poisoned by sub-

cutaneous injection of vanadium still possess nerves and muscles which, in irrita-
bility or in power of doing work, are quite normal. Nevertheless vanadium attacks

the nervous centres of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata.

                                   By John Pkiestley.

   The author experimented with guinea-pigs, rabbits, and frogs, injecting solutions
of neutral chromate of sodium (Na^CrO,,) beneath the skin or into tlie veins. lie

concludes :

   1. That -1 to -3 grm. CrOj, in the form of the above-named salt, is a powerful
poison for rabbits and guinea-pigs.

   2. That death is preceded by sp.asms and violent retching, which commence a
few minutes after injection of the poison. Spasms are succeeded by paralysis of
motion and, in frogs, abolition of reflex action.

   3. That the blood-pressure first rises and then falls, the fall continuing until death.
Further, that after the fall has become marked the pulse suddenly becomes ab-
normal, stopping for the space of a beat or two at irregular intervals, which are
occasionally of considerable length, the pulse becoming regular again during the
intervals. The author believes that this irregularity of pulse is due to an action
on the vagus nervous centre.

   4. That the alimentaiy mucous membranes are the seat of extensive congestion
and ecchymoses.

   5. That the kidneys become congested.
   6. That muscles and nerve-trunks and extremities remain sensiblv normal.

The Termination of the Nerves in the Vestihide and Semicircular Canals of

   Mammals. By Ukban Peitchaed, M.D., F.B.C.S., Aural Surgeon to

    King's College Jfosjjital, Lecturer on Animal Physiology at King's College.

   The author gave the results of his investigations into the structure of the ner\-e
epithelium, as it is called, which contains the termiual distribution of the acoustic

nerve.

 --The membranous labyriutli is composed of three layers externally some loose

connective tissue, then a distinct layer of dense connective tissue"^ (the tunica

propria), and lying on this a single laj-'er of tessellated epithelium. At the acoustic
spots, where the nerve is distributed, this membrane is firmly adherent to the

osseous wall, and the epithelial layer becomes transformed into nerve epithelium.
   In the saccule and utricle these spots are termed the macuhe acusticre, and in

--the three arapullaj the cristse acustica?, the latter being raised into a kind of ridge.
   The nerve epifhclium. Max Schultze described this structure as consisting of

three elements-- a deep layer of nuclei, a superficial layer of cylindrical cells, and
between them numerous filiform cells.
            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      157

   Odeiiiiis and KoUikev's researches confirmpd these observations, but Ilasse gives

a totally dllierent account of the structure. He describes it as consisting: of alter-

nating elongated cells, the one bearing the ciliuni, the other isolating the ciliated
cells, and resting with a broad base on the menibrana propria.

    liudinger sominvhat reverses the description of Hasse, and states that the
isolating cells are triangular, with their bases turned upwards so as to form the

free border of the epithelial mas.^, and doubts the existence of the deep layer of

nuclei.

  --Ebner believes the essential elements to consist of two forms a superficial layer

of cylindrical ciliated cells rounded oft' below, and a deep multiple layer of filiform
cells with their filaments passing up between the cjdindrical cells.

  --Ijastly, Paul Meyer describes it as made of two parts a deep layer of nuclei, and

a superficial one of cylindrical ciliated cells tapering off below.

   The author's observations have led him to conclusions which, although they arc
essentially difierent from those of the authors just alluded to, yet appear to him to

reconcile to a great degree their various conflicting descriptions.

   The appearance of this structure differs according to the position in the macula

of the portion examined.

  A typical portion, such as may be seen midway between the centre and circum-

ference of the spot, consists of a layer of alternating elongated cells, l)ordered above
l)j' a distinct cuticular membrane, and connected below with those nuclei which

form the deep layer described by most authors. So that the cellular elements may

be said to consist of two alternating forms of elongated cells, each having an upper
and a lower nucleus. The author calls the first the thorn-cells, on account of the
shape of their cilium, and the second the bristle-cells for a similar reason.

   The thorn-cells have a fusiform body containing an oval nucleus; from this body
passes upwards through the cuticular membrane a tapering cilium or thorn ; the
lower extremity is prolonged downwards, and again expands to enclose its second

nucleus.

   The bristle-cells have a triangular body containing an oval nucleus ; the base of
this is intimately connected with the cuticular membrane, and from this base
passes upwards a narrow bristle-like ciliuni ; the apex of this triangular ))ody is
prolonged downwards and has a second nucleus like its fellow thorn-cell.

   The cuticular membrane is a very thick, well-marked membrane, holding the
cellular elements in their place, and perforated for the passage of the cilia. This
membrane is analogous to the membrana reticularis of the organ of C'orti, and

--the author therefore proposes to call it by the same name.
   Modifications of the nerve epithelium. As there is a general increase in thickness

of the macula from circumference to centre, so the cells and their various parts

elongate ; the cilia, which are short and stumpy at the edge, become very much
longer and comparatively finer at the centre of the acoustic spot. At Ihe circum-

ference the cells pass by insensible gradations into the columnar epithelial celks,
which surround the whole macula. Towards the centre the upper nucleus and
surrounding protoplasm of the bristle-cells gradually diminisli and then are lost

altogether, this part of the cell being represented by a trabecula from the mem-
brana reticularis. The bristle-like cilium remains after the upper protoplasmic

mass has disaj^peared ; but eventually this also is lost.

  --The termination of the nerves in the macula. The uerve-fibres arriving at the

membrana propria lose their white substance, and enter the nerve epithelium

without it. After passing this point there is considerable difficulty in tracing the
nerve-filaments ; but there is no doubt that they form a plexus around the deeper

layer of nuclear bodies, and that some of the filaments may be traced directly or

--indirectly into the ciliated cells.
    The otolith mass. Covering the acoustic spot is a soft mass into which the cilia
pi-ojoct to a certain distance ; this is evidently of a cuticular nature, and is analogous
to tiie menibrana tectoria of the cochlea. The otoliths are fixed by this mass,

being chiefly contained in its outer portion.

Physiology of the Nervous System of Medvscf.

 By George J. EojJAjfES, M.A., F.L.S., ^r.

 --Fundamental Observations. The autlior has succeeded in demonstrating tlie pre-

sence of a nervous system in Medusae, the ganglionic element of which appears to

be localized exclusively in the margin of the swimming-hell. For he found that

on excising the entire 'margin of the bell in any species of naked-eyed Medusse the

swimming motions of the bell instantly ceased and were never again resumed,
while the severed margin continued its rhvthmical contractions for days. With

the covered-eyed Medusse the case is not quite so definite ; for although the para-
lysis of the bell, which is here likewise produced by the operation just described,

is usually complete for a time, it is not always permanent ; but, after periods

varjing from a few seconds to half an hour or more, occasional contractions begin

to manifest themselves. Moreover, in the case of the covered- eyed Meduste, the

author found that excision of the lithocysts alone was attended with the same degree

of paralyzing effect on the bell as was excision  of the  entire  margin                                whereas  in
                                                                                                     ;

the case of the naked-eyed MedusaB such was not the case. Histological observa-

tions revealed the presence of ganglion-cells and nerve-fibres in the lithocysts.

 --Natural Mh/thm. As regards the natural rhythm of the Medusa;, it was ob-

served that its rate has a tendency to bear an inverse proportion to the size of the

individual; but that on submitting an individual to artificial segmentation, the

rate of the rhythm exhibited by the various segments showed a tendency, other

things equal, to vary directly as the size of the segment.

  When forms of mutilation were practised in which the margin of the swimming-

bell was left intact, it was observed that after a temporary acceleration the rate of

the rhythm progressively declined, and became stationary at a rate that was slower
the greater the amount of tissue that had been removed. From these experiments

the author is inclined to infer that the apparently automatic action on the part of

--the marginal ganglia is really of the nature of a reflex a constant stimulation being

presumably supplied b}^ those other parts of the organism the removal of which was

attended with a retardation of the rhj'thm.

The rate of the rhythm is increased by elevations of temperature as far as 60° F.,

but in still warmerwater (70°-S0°) the rate, after having been temporarily quickened,

becomes permanently slowed. Diminution of temperature likewise produces a

retarding efiect on the rhythm, and eventually (20°) altogether stops it.

   Some specimens of Aurelia aurita were frozen solid, so that all their gelatinous

tissues were pierced through in every direction by an innumerable multitude of

ice ciystals, which had been formed by the freezing, in situ,oi the sea-water which

enters so largely into the composition of these tissues. Yet, on being thawed out,

the animals recovered, although their original rate of rhythm did not fully return.

Their tissues then presented a ragged appearance, which was due to the disinte-

grating effect produced by the formation of the ice crystals.

 --The rate of the rhythm is accelerated by oxygen and retarded by carbonic acid.

   Stimulation. All the contractile tissues of all the Medufas are keenly sensitive

to all kinds of stimulation. When a swimmiDg-bell, for instance, is paralyzed by

excision of its margin, it invariably respouds to a single stiuuilus by once perforai-
ing that movement which it would have performed in response to that stimulus

had it still been in an uumutilated state. To mechnnical stimulation the sensitive-

--ness of the paralyzed bells is wonderfully great a drop of sea-water let fall from

an inch in height upon the contractile tissue being sutficient, in seme species, to

elicit a responsive contraction. In their responses to all kinds of chemical stimuli,

the excitable tissues of the Medusas conform in every respect to the rules v.'hich

are followed by the nervo-muscular tissues of higher animals. Similarly with

thermal and electrical stimulation. Light also acts as a powerful and unfailing

stimulus in the cases of some of the naked-eyed Medusje. Sarsia, for instance,
                    TB,A>fSACT10NS OP THE SECTIONS.                  1 JD

almost invariably responds to a single flash by giving one or more contractions.

On removing the margin such responses cease on the part of the bell, although they

continue on tlie part of tho severed margin. But on removing the so-called " eye-

specks" from the margin such responses cease; and that these "eye-spocks" 'are

true visual organs is further proved by the fact that, while unmutilated<b'ff ?·«/«; will

throng into the path of a beam of light, and even follow the beam wherever it is

moved through the water, i^'arsiee vfith their "eye-specks " removed will no longer
do so. Any one of the luminous rays of the spectrum acts as a stimulus, but not

so the rays which lie on either side of the luminous spectrum.

The period of latent stimulation was determined in the case oiAurcUa aurt'ta

by employing the induction-shock. It was foimd to vary greatly, according to the

temperature at which the tissue was kept. Thus, while in water at 20'^ it was

5 sec, in water at 70° it was } sec. It was also found to vary gi-eatly under the

influence of so-called summation of stimuli. Thus, while in v/ater at 4o° the latent

period was g sec. in the case of the first of a series of stimuli supplied in regular

succession at two seconds' interval, it was only | sec. in the case of the tenth stimulus

of the series. In every such series of stimuli supplied at short intervals the latent

period becomes progressively less and less until it attains its minimum, while the

strength of the contraction becomes progressively greater and greater until it attains

its vuiximum, the intensity of the stimulation, of course, remaining constant

throughout the series. If more than one minute is allowed to elapse between any

two successive stimuli of a series, this beneficial or arousing effect of summation no

longer asserts itself ; the tissue has, as it were, forgotten the occurrence of the

previous stimuli. That the arousing effect in question is due to the occurrence of

the successive stimidatiom, and not to the occurrence of the successive contractions,

appears to be indicated by the fact that if induction-shocks be employed whicli

are of less than minimal intensity at the commencement of a series, they first become

of minimal and evontuallj^, at the end of a series, of more than minimal intensity.
Now, as in this case no contraction occurs in response to the first three or four

stimuli, it is evident that the summating influence must have reference to the

process of stimulation as distinguished from that of contraction. Nevertheless,

that the summating effect is a general one pervading the whole extent of the re-

sponding tissue, and not confined to the area occupied by the electrodes, is proved

by the fact that if, during the administration of a series of stimuli, the electrodes

be suddenly shifted to another part of the excitable tissue (perhaps eight or nine

inches from their previous seat), the summating effect is resumed from the point at

which it was left by the previous stimulus. The author further proved by various

experiments that during the natural swimming motions of the JMeduste every con-

traction exerts a beneficial influence on its successor, which resembles both in kind

Artificial Rhythm.  the paralyzed disk of ^(w-e/^rtfoo-i'i'rtissubmitted to strong

faradaic stimidation,it goes into a tolerably well-pronounced tetanus. If the strength

of the current be now diminished, the tetanus assumes a wild and tumultuous charac-

ter, somewhat resembling that of a heart under similar circumstances. If the strength

of the current be again progressively diminished the character of the tetanus bo-

comes progressively less and less tumultuous, until at last it ceases to be tetanus

and passes into rhythm. This artificial rhythm is quite as regular and quite as

sustained as is the natural rhythm of the animal. Its rate varies in difiereut spe-

cimens, but usually corresponds with that of rapid swimming. Progressively di-

minishing the strength of the faradaic stimulation has the ertect of progi'essively

decreasing the rate of the rhythm down to the point at which all response ceases'^;

but between the slowest rhythm obtainable by minimal stimulation and the most
rapid rhythm obtainable before the appearance of tetanus there are numerous

degrees of rate to be observed. The artificial rhythm may be obtained with a

portion of any size of irritable tissue, and whether a" small or a large piece of the

latter be included between the electrodes. The persistency of any given rate of
rhythm under the same strengtli of cm'rent is wonderfully great ; 'for it generally

requires more than an hour of continuous faradization before the rh-\thm beo-ins
to become irregular, owing to incipient exhaustion. At first only one systole is

it was before. After a time, however, tlie exhaustion will pass away, and the
Noworiginal degree of sensitiveness will thereupon return.

faradaic sti'mulation, which is alone capable of producing rhythmic response, is

either minimal, or but slightly more than miaimal, in relation to the sensitiveness

of the tissue wlieu fresh." Consequently, when the degree of this sensitiveness is

somewhat lowered by temporary exhaustion, the intensity of the stimulation

becomes somewhat less than minimal in relation to this lower degree of sensitive-
ness. Tlie tissue therefore fails to perceive the presence of the stimulus, and con-

sequently fails to respond. But so soon as the exhaustion is_ completely recovered

from, .so soon will the tissue again perceive the presence of tlie stimulation._ It

will therefore again respond, again become temporarily exhausted, again fail to

perceive the presence of the stimulation, and therefore again become temporarily

indefinite number of times ; and as the conditions of nutrition, as well as those of
stimulation, remain constant, it is manifest that the responses may thus become

periodic.

   In order to test this hypothesis the author nude the following experiments.
Having first noted the rate of the rhythm under faradaic stimulation of minimal
intensity, without shifting tlie electrodes or altering the streugth of the current, he

discarded tlie faradaic stimulation, and substituted for it single induction-shocks

thrown in with a key. He found tliat the maximum number of these single shocks

which lie could thus" tlirow in in a given time, so ns to procure a respome to every
shoch, corresponded exactly with the number of contractions which the tissue had

previouslv given during a similar interval of time when under the influence of the
faradaic current of similar intonsit)'. For instance, to take a specific case, it was
found that under the faradaic current the rate of the rhythm was one in two seconds.
Bv now tlirowing in single shocks of the same intensity, it was found that the
quickest rate at which these could be thrown in, so as to procure a response to

every shock, was one in two seconds. If thrown in at a slightly quicker rate, every

now' and then, at regular intervals, one of the shocks would fail to elicit a response.
The length of theselntervals, of course, depended on the rate at which the succes-
sive sliocks were thrown in ; so that, for instance, if they were thrown in at the

rate of one a second, the tissue wordd only, but always, respond to every alternate

sliock.                                                  . . .,,                        ^·

The foUowino-, and somewhat similar, experiment is still more conclusive.                                        AK a

'alrerdy stated, the rate of the artificial rhythm under faradaic stimulation varies

v,-ith the strength of the faradaic current. Now, by choosing at random any

streugth of faradaic stimulation between the limits where rhythmic response oc-

curred, and by noting the rate of the rhythm under that strength, the author was

o-oneral!v able to predict the precise number of single induction-shocks lie could

--afterwards aflxird to thro-.v i:i with the same strength of current, so as to procure n.

resijonse to every shock this number, of course, corresponding exactly with tli;'

rate of the rhythm previouslv manifested under the faradaic stimulation.

Other experiments, which'do not admit of being briefly detailed, have likewls.T

confirmed the above h-^-pothesis. Upon this hypothesis, therefore, the author ha ;

c-iustruetod a theory concerning the rhythmic action of organic tissues in general.

The details of this theory cannot be rendered in the present abstract; but in its

main outlines it is very simple, viz. that all such rhythmic action is due to the

alUn-uate process of exhaustion and recovery of cuntractile tissues, whicli has ju?t

been explained. Therefore the particidar case of rhythmic action of ganglionatod
tissues is supposed by this theory to bo due, not to any special resistance mechanism

on the part of the ganglionic tissues, but to the primary qualities of the contractile

tissue?. In i.>ther words, the functiou of the ganglia is supposed to l)e merely that of

as is the artificial rhythm of AurvUa aiirifa. From this it will bo .«oeu th.at the
essential point of dillereuce between the cuiTent theory of rhythm as due to ganglia

--and the theory now proposed consists in this that whereas both tlieories suppose

the acciamilation of energy bj' ganglia to be a continuous process, the resistauce

theoiy supposes the discharr/e of this accumulated energy to be intermittent, while

the exhaustion theory supposes it to be continuous. According to the former

theory, therefore, the rhythm results because the stimulation is periodic ; according
to the latter theory, the rhythm results because the alternate process of exhaustion

and recovery, or the fall and rise of excitability, is periodic.

Without waiting to discuss the it priori merits of these rival theories, the author

proceeded at once to mention some further experiments v,-hich were designed to

test the new theory, and which have so far confirmed it as to show the causes which

modify the natural rhythm of Aurelia likewise modify, in the same ways antl

degrees, the artificial rhythm.

(ff) Other modes of constant stimulation, besides that supplied by favadaic elec-

tricitj', likewise cause rhythmic action on the part of the deganglionated tissues of

MedusK. For instance, the voltaic curreut causes this action * ; and dilute

chemical stimuli tend to produce the same effect.

(h) With each increment of temperature the rate of the artificial rhythm in-

creases suddenl}', just as it does in the case ofthe natural rhythm. Moreover, there

seems to be a sort of rough correspondence between the amount of iufluence that

any given degree of temperature exerts on the rate of the natural and ofthe artificial

rhythm respectively. Further, it will be remembered that in warm v.-ater the

natural rhythm, besides being cj^uicker, is not so regular as it is in cold water : thus

also it is with the artificial rhythm. Lastly, water below 20'^ or above ^o^ sus-

pends the natural rhythm ; and the artificial rliytlim is suspendol at about the

same degrees.

(c) Carbonic acid retards and eventually su.^pends the artificial rhytlnn, in just

the same way as this gas acts on the natural rhj'thm.

  (f?) When the marginal ganglia of Sarsia are removed, the manubrium shortly

afterwards relaxes to five or six times its normal length. There can be no doubt

that this eft'ect is due- to the muscular fibres of the manubrium having been pre-

viously kept in a state of tonic contraction by means of a coutiiiuous ganglionic

discharge from the margin. Now physiologists are unanimous in regarding mus-

cular tonus as a kind of gentle tetanus due to a persistent ganglionic stimul.ntion ;
and against this opinion nothing can be said. But, in accordance with tlie ac-

cepted theory of ganglionic action, physiologists further suppose that the only

reason why some muscles are thrown into a state of tonus by ganglionic stimula-

tion, while other muscles are thrown into a state of rhythmic action by the same

means, is because the rei-i^fance to tlie passage of the stimulation from the ganglion

to the muscle is less in the former than in the latter case. On the other hand, tlie
new theory of ganglionic action explains the diflerence by supposing a difttireut

degvec ol irritabilifi/ on the part of the muscles in the two cases; for it will be

remembered that in the author's experiments on paralyzed AurcUn, if the continuous

stinuilation were of somewhat more than minimal intensity, tctaiuis was the result,

while if such stimulation were but of minimal intensity, the result was rhythmic

Nowaction.     the author finds in the case of Sarsia that the muscular tissue ofthe

manubrium is more excitable than th.o muscular tissue of the bell ; so that, for this

and other reasons, the facts here accord more closely with the exhaustion than

--with the resistance theoiy of ganglionic action.
   licflex Action. The occurrence of reilex action in the Medusai is of a vi'ry marked

character. For instance, if the manubrium be irritated, the swimming-organ re-

sponds to the irritation by giving one or more contractions; but if tlie marginal

ganglia be now removed, the swimming-organ no longer responds even to the most

violent u'ritation. Again, in Aurelia, if only one litliocyst be Ifft in fifti, and if,

during a pause in the activity of the latter, any part of the irritable surface of the

163 REPORT--1876.

swiinmiug-organ be very gently iri'itated, the resulting contractile '^vaye does not

start from the immediate seat of irritation, but from the ganglion which still

remains in situ.

But this allusion to a " contractile wave " renders it necessary to state that all the

conti'actile motions of the Meduste (whether due to ganglionic or to artificial

stimulation) may be seen to be of the natme of contractile waves which spread

from the i^oint of stimulation as from a centre. The rate at which they travel

varies greath' in diflerent species, and in the same species imder dilterent conditions

of temperature, &c. The author has made an elaborate series of experiments by

section, with the view of ascertaining whether these contractile waves are merely

muscle- waves or depend for their passage upon the presence of rudimentary nerves.

He finds that the tissue will endure almost any severity of overlapping SL^ctions

--without suflering loss of its physiological continuity the contractile waves still con-

tinumg to zigzag back and fore among the overlapping cuts. Similarly v/ith

another form of section, which consists in carrying a cut round and round the

swimming-disk in the form of a spiral, the Medusae being thus converted into the

form of a ribbon. In such a form of section the author has repeatedly seen con-

tractile waves passing freely from end to end of a ribbon-shaped strip of tissue

measuring only an inch across and more than a yai-d in length. He was therefore

at first inclined to regard these contractile waves as merely muscle-waves. Never-

theless there is likewise an important body of evidence to be adduced in favour of

a nervous plexus. In particular, if the spiral mode of section be carried on suffi-

ciently fai', a point is, sooner or later, sure to come at which i\\e contractile waves

cease to pass forward : they become blocked at that point, and this ahcays with

t/reat stidcknness. Moreover, the point at which such blocking of the waves takes

place is extremely variable in diflerent individuals of the same species. Lastly,

the fact tlir.t reflex action has been proved to occur, shows that these excitable

tissues are pervaded by tracts which present the distinguishing function of nei-ve,

viz. the conveying of impressions to a distance. And it is of the first importance

to obser\-e that this fimction is quite as difficult to destroy by the introduction of

overlapping or of spiral cuts as is the function on which the passage of contractile

waves depends. lu other words, reflex action continues to take place through

forms of sectiou as severe as those through which contractile waves continue to

!)ass. And tliis f;ict the author considers the most important that has as yet been

nought to ligbt in the whole range of invertebrate physiology for he regards it as
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

evidence that in these primitive nervo-muscular tissues the conductile or nervous

element becomes diflerentiated from the contractile or muscular element in such

a way that vicarious action is permitted to take place to any extent among the

incipient conductile elements. And in .striking confirmation of this view another

series of observations may here be mentioned.

Tiaropsis inclicans is a bowl-shaped species of naked-eyed Medusfe, to which the

author has assigned this name in reference to a highly interesting function that is

manifested b_v its manubrium. This fuuction consists in the organ localizing, with

the utmost precision, any point of irritation which is situated in the bell. For

iustance, if any point in the irritable surface of the bell be pricked with a needle,

the manubrium moves over towards that point and applies its tapered extremity

to the exact spot where the prick has been inflicted. But now, this unerring pre-

cision with wliich the manubrium indicates a seat of iriitatiou in the bell may be

completely destro^'ed by introducing a short cut between the base of the manubriiun

and the seat of irritation in the bell. The afferent connexions, therefore, on which

this localizing function depends are thus shown to be exclusively, or almost exclu-

sively, radial. But although under these conditions the manubrium is no longer

able to localize the seat of irritation, it nevertheless continues to perceive, so to speak,

that irritation is being applied someivherc for every time the irritation is applied
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

the manubrium actively dodges about from one part of the bell to another, apply-

ing its extremity now at this place and now at that one, as if seeking in vain for

Nowthe ofl'ending bodv.  this fact shows that the stimulus, on reaching the point

at which the afferent tract is severed, escapes from the severed to the unsevered

tracts through the vicarious action of the latter.

There is another point of interest connected with this apparently reflex action.
TftANSACriONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                  163

When the author removed the mamibrium at its base, he found that on now irri-

tating- any part of its own substance the apex endeavoured to curve down towards

the seat of irritation. Similarly, if only a portion of the manubrium were removed,

the pointing action of that portion resembled the pointing action of the entire

organ, while the stump that remained in situ would continue to move over as far

as it could towards any point of imtation situated in the bell. Hence there can

be no doubt that every part of the manubrium is independently endowed with the

capacity of localizing a seat of irritation either in its own substance or in that of

the bell. And in this we have a very remarkable fact ; for the localizing function

which is so very efficiently performed by the manubrium of this Medusa, and which,

if any thing resembling it occurred in the higher animals, would certainly have

definite ganglionic centres for its structural correlative, is here shared equally by

every part of the exceedingly tenuous contractile tissue that forms the outer surface

of the organ, ^^"e have thus in this case a general diti'usion of ganglionic function,

--which is coextensive with the contractile tissues of the organ.
   Poisons. The author has conducted a number of experiments with reference to

the effects of the various nerve- and muscle-poisons on the primitive nervo-muscular

tissues. He has tried chloroform, ether, morphia, caflein, nitrate of amyl, alcohol,

nicotiu, strychnia, veratrium, digitalin, atropia, curare, cyanide of potassiiun, &c.,

&c., and he finds that in the main all these poisons exert precisely the same eftects
Aon the Medusae as they do on the higher animals.
                                                   vast number of other obser-

vations were detailed which do not admit of being briefly abstracted. Those who

are interested in the subject are therefore referred to the ' Philosophical Trans-

actions,' where a full account of the research is to be found.

Belie^iiio' the study of Piimillve Apricultiire to be of great iinporfauce iu cou-

uexioB witli the iiiigTatious and social inteicoiirse of races in the prehistoric times,

I have endeiiToured to show :

1st.    The autiquitj' of the art and its bearing- upon civilization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           that it could only
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

have originated among people having a settled abode, and therefore was probably

first practised iu a very imperfect state by the women of tribes left in tents or villages

--to await the return of hunters a probability which is strengthened by the fact that

women are still the sole agriculturists among man}^ semicivilized races.

   2nd. That although agriculture may have originated in many lands and at dif-
ferent times, many peoples yet remain iu total ignorance of it, and the agriculture

of the lower races consists in the cultivation of indigenous roots and fruits, the

cultivation of the cereals being confined to civilized races and to those who have

learnt it through contact v.^ith them.

3rd. That the origin and native land of all the cereals remains obscure, althoLigh

all, excepting maize, are supposed to be indigenous in the eastern hemisphere,

whilst maize is aihrmed to be of American origin and to have been unknown

in the Old World before the time of Columbus. This last assertion I have ventured

to dispute, from the fact that travellers have found it in cultivation in various parts

of Asia and Africa before any intercourse had arisen with white men, and because it is

described in the ' Niewe Herball ' published 1578, as Frianentimi Ttircivum or Asia-

ticum.

4th. That there are traces iu America, China, and ancient Egypt of a time,

anterior to the cultivation of cereals, when the aborigines of these countries fed,

as the Pacitic-islanders do now, upon fruits and roots, some of them poisonous, but

rendered wholesome by pounding, maceration, and desiccation, and tliat this primi-

tive state in these countries is couiirmed by the annals of China, by the testimony

of Herodotus, and by American myths.

·5th. That a similarity in the customs, myths, monuments, and religions of China,

Egypt, Peru, and Mexico leads to the conclusion that a cognate pre-Arvan race

introduced the cultivation of the cereals into all these countries, and with them the
v\orship of the Moon as an agricultural deity.

6th. That the absence of agricultural implements from prehistoric discoveries

proves their extreme simplicity, being probably only a pointed stick, which still

forms the sole agricultural implement in many countries, whilst it is not improbable

that some of the stone celts were employed as hoes, and that flint ilakes inserted

in wooden frames served then, as they do now in the East, as harrows and thre,9hing

implements                                                         and that furrows and ridges seem everywhere to have Ijeeii used in the
                                                                ;

cultivation of grain, whilst corn-hills seem to be confined to America, although

used in Africa iu the cultivation of maudioca.

7th. That the traces of primitive agriculture confirm the conclusions of modern

ethnologists as to the early condition, gradual development, and extensive mi-
grations of the human race.

   The writer first stated tliat tlie Australians call tlie white luan Wanda, also a
word for spirit, deuiou, or angel. In Afriean languages, Wanduni and Waui are
names for man : the names for man in African and Geutra!-Amer;can languages
interchanged with those for monkey, lizard, frog : of these numerous examples were
given. In jVssyrian monkey is '' udumu,'' which Kev.W. Houghton compares with the

Hebrew Adam as related to the anlliropoid ape. The Aryan Man and Son are found

in ^yrica and the prehistoric world in such relation as all Aryan pre-historic roots
are. There was no separate creation or development of Aryan roots, though there
was a selection, and Sanskrit words may be found among some of the lowest savages
in Africa. This thing is certain, that the Aryan languages were first those of blacks,
as are most of the languages of tlie world, and the words supposed to represent an
Aryan civilization are those of the culture of the earliest bhiclvs and savages. So,
too, as to primitive mythology, in the facts above slated will perh.aps be found the
origin of telem worship and of animal ancestors.

    This paper embraces the author's investigations on that faniih^ and epoch to
which he had given the name of Sumero-Pernvian, but to which the title of Ilittite
had lately been given. Beginning with the Canaanites, the Hittites, kc, he stated

his investigations as to the decipherment of the Ilittite or Hamath inscriptions

and the Canaauite terms in the Bible. This part embraced in copious tables the
parallelism of (Jauaanite town names recorded in Scripture with those of Asia Minor,
pre-IIellenic Greece, Etruria, Italy, Iberian Spain (not Basque), Babylonia, India,
Beru, and Mexico. Applying this evidence again to support the linguistic, the com-
munity of Etruscan with Lydian and Ilittite was affirmed. The earliest culture of
India was assigned to the same family. Adopting the mass of evidence, the lan-
guages and culture of the great kingdoms of America were explained as being of
a like epoch with the '^Hittite," and the phenomena of an arrested culture in
America were accounted for. Thus while there were points of conformity in culture
and mythology, x\merica never shared in tlie highest stages in the Semitic or Aryan

developments. Traces of the tradition of the former communication with the New

A^'orld were illustrated.

             The Classijlcation of Arroiu-heads. By W. J. Knowies.

   The author objected to the jiresent classification. One author applies the term

triangular to a slightly' indented type of arrow-head, and indented to a more
deeply indented type, while another includes under the name triangular both

triangular and indented arrow-heads. He .also objected to the term leaf-shape,
as stemmed and indented arrow-heads often closely resemble leaves. He suggested

that " ovate " for broad and short, and " lanceolate " for the narrow and elongated
forms, would be more appropriate type names for the so-called leaf-shape. PIo also

objected to arrow-heads with four straight edges but much more elongated at one

end than the other being classed as lozenge-shaped. This form has often the edges

of the base arched outv/ards and those of the point inclining inwards. He would

include such under the name kite-shape, and apply the term lozenge-shaped onlj' to

those arrow-heads which had four edges of equal length. He would apply the term

triangular only to arrrow-heads having tliree straight edges ; and indented to those

which were indented at the base, whether much or little. Those which had a

central tang or stem, whether barbed or not, he would, to save confusion, include

under the term stemmed. He considers that this arrangement would retain many
of the old terms with which we are familiar, and yet considerably improve matters.

Our classification would then bo stemmed, indented, triangidar, ovate, lanceolate,

lute-shaped, lozenge-shaped ; and if the term leaf-shaped has got too great a hold
to be given up he suggests that it could be retained and ovate and lanceolate dropped

for the present.

The author referred to the objects (arrow-heads, scrapers, &c.) which he had

found in pits among sandhills at Portstewart, at the tiufe he brought the matter

before the Belfast meeting in 1874, and stated that the most remarkable find since

that time had been about a dozen very small heads of serpentine, concave on one

side and convex on the other, which probably formed jjart of a necklace that had been

lost, or which had been placed in an urn at the time of an interment. They were

all found within a few yards of the same spot. He also found one of those stones

known as  Tilhiiggersteens or oval tool  stones                                 and  from being found with the flict

implements, he argued that it belonged to the Stone Age. He also found bones and

a portion of deei-horn v.'hich had been deeply cut, and he endeavoured to show,

from experiments made by himself on a common beef-bone with a flint flake, that

the cutting had been made by flint tools.

           Hutives of New Hebrides, Banks, and Santa- Cruz Islands.

   Tlie natives inliabiting these islands owe their origin to the same stock from

which the western and southern portion of New Guinea and the islands Wug im-

mediately to the southward of that countr}' appear to have been peopled. This

stock is evidently Papuan, and has by its numerous and widespreading branches

not only extended itself over the islands of the Coral Sea, but as far east as the

Fijis, in which latter country, however, the race has evidently received a strong-

infusion of Malay blood.

It is probable that the islands were inhabited at a very remote period, but at

what era population set in, whether at the first instance it was purely accidental

and subsequently gradual, or whether originally it was undertaken from design and

accelerated at any particular period by political convulsions, cannot at present be

determined, as there is no date on which to rely with confidence. But whatever

opinion may be formed on the identity of the present race, the strilciug resemblance

in person, featm-e, language, and customs which prevails throughout justifies the

conclusion that the original population issued from the same som-ce, and that the

peculiarities and characteristics which distinguish the tribes or communities on

diflerent islands have been mainly brought about by long separation, local circum-

stances, and the intercourse of foreign trades and settlers.

Physically considered these people are a well-built athletic race of savages, who

appear to inherit in a very marked degree all the characteristics of the Papuan

race. The men average about 5 feet inches in height, are erect in figure, with

broad chests and massive limbs, which in many instances display great muscular

development. The colour of the skin is usually of a dark reddish brown, but some-

times it is quite black, and is often covered with short curly hair, especially about

the breast, back, and shoulders. They have large well-formed heads, the facial

angle is about 4G°, while the cranium in the majority of instances betokens a fair

degree of mental development. The features are usually regular in form, the fore-

head high and massive, with a considerable prominency in the region of the frontal

bone ; the nose is mostly flat, but iu some instances aquiline, the nostrils wide, the

mouth large and firm; the lips well cut and slightly full; the teeth square, strongly

set and very white and even ; while the eye, large, of a dark brown colour and

shaded by long lashes, is not too deeply set and is quick and penetrating in its

glance.

The hai:', which forms one of the most remarkable featm-es of this race, is dis-

tributed thickly over the head in the form of small spiral cm-Is, and when allowed

to grow in its natural way has a woolly appearance, and resembles at first "lance

that of    the African negTO                                                                                    but  it  is  in  reality much  finer and softer.  The beai-d,
                                                                                                             ;

which is of the same crisp curly nature as the hair, is worn short. In the northern

islands the men go completely naked, but in the southern islands, where the climate

is slightly cooler, they affect a scant covering about the loins. They are fond of

decorating the head with flowers and feathers and of tattooing the face with red

and blue pigments, which imparts to them a savage and ferocious look. The form

of tattooing, however, varies much upon diflerent islands, and seems to serve as a

distinctive mark among the various tribes inhabiting them. On the island of

Tana the natives tattoo each cheek with big patches of red pigment, and wear- blue

streaks under the eves and across the forehead. On the other islands various forms
168 RFPOKT-- 18/6.

of tattooing prevail ; but iu Banks' group, wliere there appears to have been at
some time or other an admixture of Malay blood, a totally different kind of tattoo-
ing obtains from that of the islands of the southward. Here the bodies, especially
of the -women, are often eon.ipletely covered with tattoo marks representing lace-
work of the most artistic design. This style of tattooing is often extended so as
to cover the body entirely from the feet, over the face, and even to the very roots

of the hair. This mode of decoration is performed by puncturing the sldn with a
sharp bamboo instrument something like a comb, and then rubbing in a blue liquid
dj'e obtained from the juice of a plant common upon the islands. All the islanders
are very fond of showy ornaments in the shape of necklaces made of beads and
coloured shells. They have the septum of the nose pierced, as likewise the lobes
of the ears, into which are thrust all kinds of decorations. The features of the
women are much flatter than those of the men, and they are in stature considerably
shorter ; there are, however, many marked exceptions to this rule. Their limbs
are round and well turned, but the long pendulous breasts of the married womeii
detract greatly from their otherwise symmetrical proportions. Their only dress is
a short covering made of the plaited filaments of the plantain-leaf, or simply of

native grass attached to a cord round the waist ; but this primitive costume varies

--j^reatly on different islands. I met with two Albinoes, one a man, on the island of

Esperitu Santo ; the other was a woman, whom I fell iu with when crossing the

island of Vanu Luva. In a^jpearance they were both very ugly ; the latter was
exceedingljf stout, and her skin, of a pinkish-white colour, was speckled all over
with dark red spots about the size of peas, while she had pink eyes, A-ery weak and

inflamed, and light sandy-coloured hair.
    All things considered, the physical condition of the islanders does not appear to

manifest anj' sign of degeneration. As a rule the natives inhabiting the various
islands appear to be healthy and vigorous. The prevailing diseases are dysenteiy,
fever, and ague, chronic rheumatism, scorbutic affections, ophthalmia, and elephan-
tiasis. They seem to have little or no notion of medical skill, but place great faith
iu charms and incantations for the cure of the diseases from which they suffer.

    In tracing the distiibution of the several races inhabiting the Pacific Islands a
marked difference is observable in the construction and decoration of the various

implements of war and the canoes employed by the natives on various islands.
The war implements of the Malays are remarkable for ue;itness of construction, skil-
ful carving, and various other artistic decorations ; while their canoes are lightly
built, tastefully painted, and inlaid with pearl shell about the prow, which is usually

curiously ^ar^ed. These canoes are often capable of carrving from fifty to sixty

men. On the other hand, among the Papuans their war implements are mostly

very rude in construction, and there is far less of the decorative art displayed in
their manufactme. Their canoes likewise, although large, can lay no claim to
artistic design, while on some islands they assume the most primitive form, being
made simplj' from huge logs liollowed out by fire. Dut even the Papuans them-
selves show a variety of design iu the construction of their weapons, and which

varies tipon different islands. On the island of Tana tlie war-club, a favourite
weapon, is very heavy, and requires to bo wielded with both hands. Many of the.se
clubs are highly polished, but the carving about them is of the simplest design.
 On the island of Erromango the spears are made entirely of wood, the points being
 neatly carved and barbed. The natives of this island also use a weapon of oval

 shape, in form not unlike the paddle of a canoe, the edges of which are hardened

by tire and made very sharp. On the island of Esperitu Santo the spears are usually
 of great length, often as much as from 10 to 12 feet; the heads of them are
 made of human thigh-bone, sharply pointed and barbed, while all are poisoned.
 The chiefs of this island, when in full war-costume, wear human jawbones around

 the left wrist, and carry one of these long spears with three prongs to it and sharp

 needle-like points of bone coming a considerable distance down the shaft. These
 spears are highly prized as emblems of chieftainship, and are handed down as heir-
 looms from one chief to another. The bows are often of great power ; and on the
 Santa-Cruz Islands, where Bishop Patteson and Commodore Goodenough were
 murdered, they are all from 8 to 10 feet long, the arrows being as much as 4 feet
 in length. On all the islands the arrows are tipped with human bone, and are

carefully barbed and poisoned, a scratch from ouo of them being sufticieut to cause

death.

         Oa an Urn from CJuuUeiffJi, Devon. Bij W. Pkxgelly, F.R.S.

   In February 187G, some workmen, digging- a pit in a field on the property

of Mr. W. Brodrick, near Ohudleigh, in Uevousbire, discovered an nru two feet

below the surface. The urn was unfortunately broken by the workmen's tools before
it was seen ; but Mr. Brodrick, who was immediately called, found its base intact
and in situ., with fragments of bone and bits of charcoal lying on it undisturbed.
Efforts were made to preserve the integrity of the bottom, but utterly failed, and
the urn is now simply a heap of about 70 small fragments. It is obvious, however,
that its base was ellipsoidal, and measured about 7x4'5 inches. Mi-. Franks is of
opinion that there is no reason to doubt that the urn is Eomau, and perhaps made in
this country. ^Ir. Busk and Mr. Flower say there is no suspicion of the bones
being human, but that the)' think them, without doubt, those of goat or sheep,
with the possible exception of a fragment of a tibia.

Two events notable in the annals of Geograplii{>al Science have lo be recorded

since the last meeting of the British Association ; and these events, as bearing
materially on the advancement of our knowledge of geography, are deserving the
special commendation of tliis Section. 1 refer to the successful issue of Cameron's
land journey across the tropical regions of Southern Africa, and to the successful

--completion of the sea voyage of the 'Challenger' a voj'age which in its scope

included the circumnavigation of the globe, the traver.-~ing the several oceans
between the 50th parallel of North -latitude and the ani.irctic circle, and the

170 REPORT--1876.

   The general results of the notable African land journey have already, through our
parent Society in London, been brought largely under public review ; and at our
present meeting mauy details of interest -will be placed oefore you by the intrepid
traveller himself. The courage, perseverance, and patient attention to the records
of this long travel have been dwelt on by our highest geographical authorities
and so far it might appear superfluous to join in praise from this chair; neverthe-
less it is to that part of the proceedings of Cameron, the unvarying attention and

care he bestowed on instrumental observations in order to give those proceedings
a secure scientific basis, to which I would direct your attention as being of a high

order of merit.

   With this example before us, remembering the country and climate in which

such unremitting labours were carried out, distinction to the future explorer can-

not rest on the mere rendering of estimated topographical details, but can alone be

fully merited when those details are verified b}' instrumental observations of an

order sufficient to place numerically before geographers the physical features and

characteristics of the explored region.

   Turning now from the results of the land journey of Cameron to those of the sea
voyage of the ' Challenger,' we are again reminded of the value of repeated and
methodically arranged instrumental observations in geographical research. With

our present knowledge of the sea-board regions of the globe, little remains, except

in polar areas, for the navigator to do in the field of discovery, or even of explo-

ration, otherwise than in those details rendered necessary by the requirements of

trade or special industries. It is to the development of the scientific features of

geogi-aphy that the  attention of voyagers requires                                                          to  be now mainly directed                                                                                                               and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

in this there is an illimitable field. The great advance in this direction resulting

from tlie two leading events of the past year, to which I have referred, fore-

shadows the geographical research of the future.
   Communications of special value from some of tliose voyagers whose good

fortune it was to leave and return to their native land in the ship ' Challenger
will doubtless be made to this and other Sections. I trust nevertheless, as one

officially interested in the expedition from its inception, and as having in early

days been engaged in liiudred work, and also, as I hope, without being considered

to have trespassed on the scientific territories of these gentlemen (ground indeed

so well earned), this meeting will view with indulgence my having selected as
the leading theme of my address to it a review of that branch of our science now

commonly known as the " Physical Geography of the Sea,'' combined with such
suggestive matter as has presented itself to me whilst engaged in following up the

proceedings of this remarkable voyage.

It has been well observed that " contact with the ocean has unquestionably

exercised a beneficial influence on the cultivation of the intellect and formation of

the character of many nations, on the multiplication of those bonds which shoidd
imite the whole human race, on the first knowledge of the true form of the earth,

and on the pursuit of astronomj' and of all the mathematical and physical sciences."

The subject is thus not  an ignoble one                                                                      and, further, it appears to me appropriate,
                                                                                                          ;

assembled as we are in the commercial metropolis of Scotland, from among whose

citizens some of the most valuable scientific investig.ations bearing on the art of

navigation have proceeded.

   As a prefatory remarlv, I would observe that the distinctive appellation " Physical
Geography of the Sea " is due to the accomplished geographer Humboldt ; it is

somewhat indefinite though comprehensive, and implies that branches of science
not strictly pertaining to geography as commonly imderstood are im-aded. But

this intrusion or overlapping of scientific boundaries is inevitable with the expan-

sion of knowledge : and it is difficult to see how the term can be wisely amended,
or how the several included branches of physics can be separated from pure

geooTaphical science.

  We are indebted in our generation to the genius and untiring energy of Maury,

aided originally by the liberal support of his Government, for placing before us, in

the twofold interests of science and commerce, an abundant store of observed facts

in this field, accompanied too by those broad generalizations which, written with

a ready pen and the fervoiu- of an enthusiast gifted with a poetic temperament.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                   171

have chavmed so many readers, and in their practical bearings have uudouhtedly

advanced the practice of navigation.

In our admiration, however, of modern progress we must not in justice pass by

withoiit recognition the labours of earlier workers in the same field. So early as

the middle of the seventeenth century we find, in Holland, Barnard Vanerius

describing with commendable accuracy the direction of the greater currents of the

--Atlantic Ocean and their dependence on prevailing winds the unequal saltness

of the sea, the diversity of temperature, as tlie causes of the direction of the winds--

and also speculating on the depths of the sea. Vanerius's geographical writings

were highly appreciated by Newton ; and editions were prepared  at Cambrid''"^e
under the supervision of that great man in 1672 and 1081.

_ To Dampier, the seaman, and Halley, the philosopher, we owe graphic descrip-

tions of the trade-winds as derived from personal experience ; wliile their causes

were investigated by lladley, and the conclusion he arrived at, that they were

due to the combined eftocts of the diurnal revolution of the earth on its axis and

the unequal distribution of heat over diflerent parts of the earth's surface, in

substance still remains unchallenged.

   To Eennell we owe a masterly investigation of the currents of the Atlantic

Ocean, an investigation which for precision and a thorough conception of the con-
ditions affecting the subject will long serve as a model for imitation. His period
covered some thirty or forty years during the end of the last and the beginning of
the present century. At that epoch chronometers, though very efficient, had
scarcely passed the stage of trial, but had nevertheless commended themselves to
the first navigators of the day, whose aim it was to narrowly watch and test
this, to them, marvellous acquisition. Eennell thus commanded nautical observa-

tions of a high order of merit ; these he individually verified, both for determining

the ship's position absolutely and relatively to tlie course pursued ; and our know-
ledge of surface-currents was established on the secure basis of differential results

obtained at short intervals, such as a day or parts of a day, instead of the previous
rude estimation fl-om a ship's reckoning extending over a whole vovage, or its

greater part.

   At a later date we have, by Eedfield, Eeed, Thom, and others, solidly practical

investigations of the gyratory and at the same time bodily progressive movements

of those fierce_ and violent storms which, generated in tropical zones, traverse

extensive districts of the ocean, not unfrequently devastating the narrow belt of
land comprised in their track, and on the sea baiffling all the care and skill of the
seaman to preserve his ship scatliless ; while the clear and elegant exposition by

Dove of their law and its application as one common general principle to the
ordinary movements of the atmosphere must commend itself as one of the achieve-
ments of modern science.

   While for the moment in the aerial regions, we must not forget the industry

and scientific penetration of the present excellent secretary of the Scottish

Meteorological Society. His more recent development of the several areas of
barometric pressure, both oceanic and continental, bids fair to amend and enlarge
our conceptions of the circulation of both the aerial and liquid coverino°-s of our

planet.

    Looking, then, from our immediate stand-point, on the extent of our Imowledge
(as confinnedby observational facts) of the several branches of phvsics pertaining to

the geography of the sea, just rapidly reviewed, we find that, resulting from ''the

methodical gathering up of "ocean statistics " by our own and other maritime
nations, in the manner shadowed forth by Maury and stamped by Ihe Brussels
Conference of 1853, we are in possession of a goodly array of broad but neverthe-
less sound results. The average seasonal limits of the trade-winds and monsoons,

with the areas traversed by circular storms, are known, also the general linear
direction and varying rates of motion of the several ocean currents and streams,

together with the diflused values of air and sea-surface tempera tiues, the areas of
uniform barometric pressure, and the prevalent winds, over the navigable parts of

the globe.

   Thus far the practical advantages that have accrued to the art of navigation
(and so directly aiding commerce) by the gradual diffusion of this knowledge,
173 REPORT--1876.

through the medium of g-raphical reuderiug on charts auil concise textual descrip-
tions, cannot he overrated ; still much is wanting in fulness and precision of detail,
especially in those distant but limited regions more receutlj^ opened out by expand-

ing trade. Science views, too, with increasing interest these advances in our
knowledge of ocean pliysics, as bearing materially on the grand economy of nature :
essays, brilliant and almost exhaustive on some of its subjects, have been given to

us by eminent men of our own day ; but here one is reminded, by the diversity in
the rendering of facts, how much remains to be done in their correlation, and
what an extensive and still expanding held is before us.

   The dawning eflbrts of science to pass beyond the immediate practical require-

--ments of the navigator are worthy of note. "We find from an admirable paper
--On the "Temperatures of the Sea at different Depths,'' by Mr. Prestwich, j ust

published in the Philosophical Transactions that in the middle of last century
the subject of deep-sea temperatures first began to attract attention, and ther-
mometers for the pm'pose were devised ; but it was not till the early part of the
present century that the curiosity of seamen appears to have been generally

awakened to know more of the ocean than could be gleaned on its surface. John
Ross, when in the Arctic seas in 1818, caught glimpses of animal life at the depth

of 6000 feet ; other navigators succeeded in obtaining the temperatm'e of succes-
.sive layers of water to depths exceeding GOOO feet ; but, so far as I can ascertain,
James Ross was, in 1840, the first to record beyond doubt that bottom had been
reached, " deeper than did ever plummet sound," at lfi,OGO feet, westward of the

Cape of Good Hope
   The impetus to deep-sea exploration, however, was given by the demand for

electrical telegraphic communication between coimtries severed by the ocean or by
impracticable land routes ; and the past twenty years marks its steady growth.
Appliances for reaching the bottom with celerity, for bringing up its water, for
bringing up its formation, for registering its thermal condition in situ, have
steadily improved ; and thus the several oceans were examined both over present
and prospective telegraph-routes. Science, aroused by the consideration that vast

--fields for biological research were opening up as proved by the returns, prolific

--with living and dead animal matter, rendered by the comparatively puny appliances

originally used for bringing up the sea-bottom invoked, as beyond the reach of
private enterprise, the aid of Government. Wiseh", earnestly, and munificently
was the appeal responded to ; and thus the ' Challenger ' expedition has become

the culminating effort of our own day.
   AVe have now reached, in all probability, a new" starting-point in reference to

many of our conceptions of the physics of the globe ; and om- own special branch may

not be the least affected. There is opened up to us, for example, as fair a general
knowledge of the depression of the bed of large oceanic areas below the sea-level,
as of the elevation of the lauds of adjacent continents above that universal zero-line.

We --learn for the first time by the ' Challenger's ' results ably supplementijd a.s

they have recently been by the action of the U.S. Government in the Pacific, and

--by an admirable series of soundings made in the exploratory German ship of war

' Gazelle ' that the unbroken range of ocean in the southern hemisphere is mucli
shallower than the northern seas, that it has no features approaching in character
those grand abyssal depths of 27,OCO and 23,.500 feet found respectively in the
North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceauo, as the greatest reliable depths recorded

do not exceed 17,000 or 1 TfiOO feet.

   The general surface of the sea-bed jjresents in general to the eje, when graphi-

cally rendered on charts by contour lines of equal soundings, extensive plateaux
varied with the gentlest of undulation?. There is diversity of feature in the

western Pacific Ocean, where, in the large area occupied by the many groups of

coral islands, their interA-ening seas are cut up into deep basins or hollows, some
1-5,000 some 20,000 feet deep. In the northern oceans one is struck with the fact
that the profouuder depths in the Pacific occupy a relative place in that ocean with

those found in Ib.e .itlantic. Eoth abyssal areas have this too in common : the
maximum depths r.ie near the land ; tlie sea-surface temperature has the maximum

degree of heat in either ocean ; and two of the most remarkable ocean streams

CFlovida-Gulf and Japan) partially encompass them.

           TRAXSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                             173

In the Atlantic Oceau, from a high southern latitude a broad channel, with not

less than some 12,000 to 15,000 feet, can be traced as extending nearly to the

entrance of Davis Strait ; a dividing undulating ridge of far less depression, on

which stand the islands of Tristan d'Acunha, St. Helena and Ascension, separates

this, which may be named the western channel, from a similar one running parallel

to the South-African continent, and which extends to the parallel of the British

Islands. It is possible that certain tidal and, indeed, climatic conditions peculiar

to the shores of the North Atlantic may be traced to this bottom conformation,

which carries its deep, canal-like character into Davis Strait, and between Green-

land, Iceland, and Spitzbergen, certainly to the 80th parallel.

There is, however, one great feature common to all oceans, and which may have

some significance in the consideration of ocean circulation, and as affecting the

--Bgenesis aud translation of the great tidal wave and other tidal phenomena, of

which we know so little namely, that the fringe of the seaboard of the gTeat con-

tinents and islands, from the depth of a few huncbed feet below the sea-level, is,

as a rule, abruptly precipitous to depths of 10,000 and 12,000 feet. This grand

escarpment is typicall}^ illustrated at the entrance of the Eritish Channel, where

the distance between a depth of 600 feet and 12,000 feet is in places only ten

miles. Imagination can scarcely realize the stupendous marginal featm-es of this

common siirface-depression.

Vast in extent as are these depressed regions--for we must recollect that they

occupy an area three times as gTeat as the dry land of the globe, and that a

temperatm-e just above the freezing-point of Fahrenheit prevails in the dense liquid

--layers covering them life is sustained even in the most depressed and coldest

parts ; while in those areas equivalent in depression below the sea-level to the ele-
vation of European Alpine regions above it animal life abundantly prevails ; structural

forms complicated in arrangement, elegant in appearance, and often lively in colour

clothe extensive districts ; other regions apparently form the sepulchral resting-

place of organisms which when living existed near the surface, their skeletons, as

it has been gi'aphically put, thus "raining down in one continuous shower through

the intervening miles of sea water." Geological formations, stamped with the

permanency of ages, common to us denizens of the dry land, appear, too, in these

regions to be in course of evolution ; forces involving the formation of mineral

concretions on a grand scale are at work ; life is abundant everywhere in the sur-
face and sub-surface waters of the oceans ; in fine, life and death, reproduction and
decay, are active in whatever depths have been attained.

As a question of surpassing interest in the great scheme of nature, the economy

of Ocean Circulation, atiecting as it does the climatic conditions of countries, has

of late attracted attention. The general facts of this circulation in relation to

climate have been thus tersely summarized : " Cold climates follow polar waters

towards the equator ; warm climates fullow warm equatorial streams towards the

Wepoles."  can all appreciate the geniality of our own climate, eepecially on the

western shores of the kingdom, as compared with the Arctic climate of the shores

of Labrador, situated on the same parallels of latitude, or indeed with the vigorous

winter climate of the adjacent North- American seaboard, even ten degrees further

to the south. These, and liindred features in other parts of tlie globe, have led to

the summarized generalization I have just referred to; but the iHitionale of these

movements of the waters is by no means assured to us.

That ocean currents were due primarily to the trade and other prevailing winds,

was the received opinion from the earliest investigation made by navigators of the

constant surface-movement of the sea. Rennell's views are thus clearlj'' stated :

" The winds are to be regarded as the prime movers of the currents of the ocean
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and of this agency the trade-winds and monsoons ha^e by far the greatest share,

not only in operating on the larger half of the whole extent of the circumambient

ocean, iDut as possessing greater power by their constancy and elevation to generate
and perpetuate currents;" . . . " next to these, in degree, are the most pre-

valent winds, such as the westerly winds beyond, or to the north and south of, the

region of trade winds."

   Mauiy, so far as I am aware, was the first to record his dissent from these

generally received views of surface-currents being due to the impulse of tha winds,

and assigned to diflerences of specific gravity, combined with the earth's rotation
on its axis, tlie movement of the Gulf-stream and other well-defined ocean

currents.

  A writer of the present time, gifted with high inductive reasoning powers, and

with observed facts before him in wide extension of those investigated by Rennell,
regards the various ocean currents as members of one grand sj'stem of circulation,
3iot produced by tlie trade-winds alone, nor by the prevailing winds proper alone,

but by the continued action of all the prevailing winds of the globe regarded as
one system of circulation ; and, without exception, he tinds the direction of

the main currents of the globe to agree exactly with the direction of the prevailing

winds.

   Another writer of the present day, distinguished for intellectual power, and

who personally' has devoted much time in the acquisition of exact ph3'sical facts
bearing on the question both in the ocean near our own shores and in the Mediter-

ranean sea, without denjdug the agency of the winds, so far as surface-drifts are

concerned, considers that general Ocean Circulation is dependent on thermal agency

alone, resulting in the movement of a deep stratum of polar waters to the equator,
and the movement of an upper stratum from the equator towards the poles, the
" disturbance of hydrostatic equilibrium " being produced by the increase of density

occasioned by polar cold and the reduction of densit}' occasioned by equatorial

--heat and that polar cold rather than equatorial heat is t\ie primum mobile of the

circulation. Analogous views had also been entertained by Continental physicists

from sea-temperature results obtained in Russian and French voyages of research

in the early part of this century.

  We have here presented to us two distinct conceptions of Ocean Circulation

the one to a great extent confined to the surface and horizontal in its movements,

the other, vertical, extending from the ocean surface to its bed, and involving, as a

consequence, "that every drop of water will thus [except in confined seas] bo

brought up from its gi-eatest depths to the surface."

   With these several hypotheses before us, it may be fairly considered that the
problem of "Ocean Circulation " is still unsolved. Possibly, too, the real solution
may require the consideration of phj'sical causes beyond those which have been
hitherto accepted. In attempting the solution, it appears to me impossible to deny

that the agency of the winds is most active in bringing about great movements of

the surface-waters, the effects of the opposite monsoons in the India and China

seas furnishing corroborative proof. Again, the remarkable thermal condition of

the lower stratum of the water in enclosed seas, as the Mediterranean, and in those

basin-like areas of the Western Pacific cut off by encircling submarine ridges from

the sources of polar supplies, combined with the equallj' remarkable condition of

cold water from a polar source flowing side by side or interlacing with warm water

from equatorial regions, as in the action of the Ijabrador and Gulf-streams, points

to the hypothesis of a vertical circulation as also commanding respect.
   The time may be considered, however, to have now arrived for gathering up the

many threads of information at our disposal, and by fresh combinations to enlarge
at least our conceptions, even if we fail in satisfying all the conditions of solution.

To this task I will briefl}' address myself.

  A grand feature in terrestrial physics, and one which I apprehend bears directly

on the subject before us, is that producing ice-movement in the Antarctic seas.

We know from the experience gained in ships (which, to shorten the passages to and

Newfrom this country, Australia, and  Zealand, have followed the great-circle route,

and thus attained high southern latitudes) that vast tracts of ice from time to time

become disrupted from the fringe of southern lands. Reliable accounts have reached

us of vessels frequently running down several degrees of longitude sadly hampered

by meeting islands of ice, and especially of one ship being constantly'sm-rounded

with icebergs in the corresponding latitudes to those of London and Liverpool,

extending nearly the whole distance between the meridians of New Zealand and

Cape Horn ; indeed, accumulated records point to the conclusion that, on the vvhole

circumference of the globe south of the 60th parallel, icebergs, scattered more or

less, may be constantly fallen in with during the s oulhem summer.

   The Antarctic voyages of D'Urville, AVilkes, and James Ross asturo us of the

                 TRANSACTIO^'S OP THE SECTIOXS.                                     175

origin and character of tlicsc ice-niasscs -wliich dot the southern seas. Each of
these voyagers was opposed in his progress southward (U'Ur^ille and Willies

on the G5th parallel, Ross on the 77th) by barrier-cliffs of ice. lloss traced this

barrier 250 miles in one unbroken line : he describes it as one continuous pei-peu-
dicular wall of ice, 200 to 100 feet high above the sea, with an unvarying level

--outline, and probably more than 1000 feet thick " a mighty and wonderful object."

Ross did not consider this ice-barrier as resting on the ground ; for there were
soundings in 2500 feet a few miles from the clitts ; Wilkes also sounded in over
5000 feet only a short distance from the barrier.

There is singular accord in the descriptive accounts by Wilkes and Ross of this

ice-region; they both dwell on the differences in character of Antarctic from

Arctic ice-formation, on the tabular form of the upper surface of the floating ice-
bergs and their striated appearance, on the extreme severity of the climate in
mid-summer, on the low barometric pressure experienced, and express equal
wonderment at the stupendous forces necessary to break awaj^ the face of these vast
ice barriers, and the atmospheric causes necessary for their reproduction.

   From the drift of this disrupted ice we have fair evidence of a great bodily move-

ment of the waters northward ; for it must be remembered that icebergs have been
fallen in with in the entire circumference of the southern seas, and that they

are pushed in the South Atlantic Ocean as far as the 40th parallel of latitude, in

the South Indian to the 45th parallel, and in the South Pacific to the SOtli

parallel.

In the discussion of Ocean Circulation, it has been assumed that water flows

from Equatorial  into Antarctic  areas ;  there  is  no  evidence, so  amfiir as I  aware,

that warm surface-water in the sense implied is found south of the 45th parallel.

Surface stream movement northward and eastward appears to be that generally

experienced in the zone between the Antarctic circle and that parallel. AVith, then,
this great bodily movement northward of Antarctic waters included certainly

between the surf^ice and the base, or nearly so, of these tabular icebergs (and thus

representing a stratum certainlj' some thousand feet in thickness), the question

Howai'ises,  and whence does the supply come to fill the created void ? Sir

Wyvillo Thomson, the leader of the ' Challenger ' scientific staff", in one of the

later cf the many able reports he has forwarded to the Admiralty, furnishes, I

think, a reasonable answer. Stating first his views as derived from study of the

Webottom-temperature of the Pacific Ocean generally, he writes : "     can scarcely

doubt that, like the similar mass of cold bottom-water in the Atlantic, the bottom-

water of the Pacific is an extremely slow indraught from the Southern Sea." He
then gives the reason, " I am every day more fully satisfied that this influx of cold

water into the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans from the southward is to be referred to

the simplest and most obvious of all canses, the excess of evaporation over precipi-

tation of the land-hemisphere, and the excess of precipitation over evaporation in

the middle and southern parts of the water-hemisphere."
   Before following up the great northward movement of Antarctic waters,! would

draw attention to a physical feature in connexion with tidal movements, which

possibly may be one of the many links in the chain of causes affecting Ocean
Circulation. The mean tide-level (or that imaginary point equidistant from the

high- and low-water marks as observed throughout a whole lunation) has been

assumed as an irnariable quantity ; our Ordnance Survey adopts it as the zero

from which all elevations are given, the f/«^(»?i /eiW for Great Britain being the level

of mean tide at Liverpool. For practical piirposes, at least on our own shores,
this mean sea-level may be considered invariable, although recent investigations

of the tides at Liverpool and Ramsgate indicate changes in it to the extent of a

few inches, wJiich changes are embraced in an annual period, attaining the

maximum height in the later months of the year: these have been assumed as

possibljr due to meteorological rather than to the astronomical causes involved by

tidal theory.

   From an examination of some tidal observations recently made near the mouth
of Swan River, in Western Australia, during the progress of the Admiralty survey

--of that coast, there appears to me evidence that in this locality open, it will bo

--remembered, to the wide southern seas the sea-level -waries appreciably during

                                                                                                   16* '

the year : thus the greatest daily tidal range in auy month yery rarely exceeds 3
feet ; but the high- and low-v/ater marks range dm-ing the year 5 feet. The higher
level is attained in June, and exceeds the lower level, which is reached in
November, by one foot or more. At Esquimalt in Vancouver Island, fairly open to

the North Pacific Ocean, there are indications of the sea-level being higher in
January than it is in June ; and a distinct excess of the mean level of the tide by
several' inches in December and Januarj^ as compared Avith the summer months,

was traced by the late Captain Beechey, E.N., at Holyhead (see Phil. Trans. 1848).
If this surface-osciUation is a general oceanic feature (and some further proofs in-

directly appear in the Reports of the Tidal Committee to this Association for 1868,
1870, 1872, to which I have just referred ; for mention is also made of a large annual

tide of over three inches, reaching its maximum in August, having been observed

--at Cat Island, in the Gulf of Mexico), we may have to recognize this physical

condition that the waters of the southern hemisphere attain a high level at the

period of the year when the sun is to the north of the equator, and that the
northern waters are highest at the period when the sun is to the south of the
equator. This is a question of so much interest that I propose again to revert to it.

Variations in the sea-level have been observed, notably in the central parts of

the Red Sea, where the surface-water, as shown by the exposure of coral reefs, is

said  to  be  fully  two  feet  lower  in  the  simimer  months  than  in  the  opposite  season
                                                                                                                     ;

these difl'ereuces of level are conmionly assigned to the action of the winds.

Renuell, in his Investigation of the Currents of the Atlantic Ocean, states, on

what would appear reliable authority, that on the African Guinea coast the level

of the sea is higher by at least six feet perpendicular in the season of the strong
S.W, and southerly winds (which winds blow obliquely into the Bay of Benin

--between April and September, the rainy season also) than during the more serene

weather of the opposite season the proof being that the tides ebb and flow

regularly in the several rivers during the period of strong S.W. winds, but that in

the other season the same rivers run ebb constantly, the level of the sea being

then too low to allow the tide-waters to enter the mouths of the rivers. It is

possible that the cause, here and elsewhere, may in part be cosmical, and neither

meteorological nor astronomical in a tidal sense.

   These several facts in relation to the variations in level of the surface of the

ocean are interesting, and point to new fields of observation and research.

Another physical feature connected \^^th the ocean-level is deserving considera-

tion ; I refer to the effect of the pressure of the atmosphere. On good authority
we know that the height of high water in the English Channel varies inversely as

the height of the barometer; the late Sir John Lubbock laid it down as a rule

that a rise of one inch in the barometer causes a depression in the height of high

water amounting to seven inches at London and to eleven inches at Liverpool.

Sir James Ross, when at Port Leopold in the Arctic seas, found that a difference of

pressure of ·608 of an inch in the barometer produced a difference of 9 inches in

the mean level of the sea, the greatest pressure corresponding to the lowest level.

These results appeared to him to indicate " that the ocean is a water-barometer on

a vast scale of magnificence, and that the level of its surface is disturbed by every

variation of atmospheric pressure inversety as the mercm-y in the barometer, and

exactly in the ratio of the relative specific gravities of the water and the mercury."

When we consider the exceptionally low barometric pressure prevailing in the

southern seas, and the comparatively low pressure of the equatorial ocean-zones

as compared with the areas of high pressure in the oceans north and south of the

equator (the latter features a late development by Mr. Buchan), these characteristic

conditions of atmospheric pressiives cannot exist without presumably affecting the

surface-conditions of adjacent waters.

There is yet one more point in connexion with the ocean-circulation which I

venture to think has not received the attention it demands ; this is, the economy of

those currents known as " counter-equatorial." Their limits are now fairly ascer-

tained, and are foimd to be confined to a narrow zone ; they run in a direction

directly opposite to, and yet side by side with, the equatorial streams of both the

WeAtlantic and Pacific oceans.             know that they run at times with great velocity

(the 'Challenger' experienced fifty miles in a day in the Pacific Ocean), and occasion-

ally in the face of the trade-wind--and that they are not merely local, stretching

as 'they do across the wide extent of the Pacific, and in the Atlantic, during the

summer months of our hemisphere, extending nearly across from the Guinea coast

to the "West-India Islands. They have, too, this significant feature, that their narrow

zone is confined to the northern side almie of the great west-going equatorial cun-ents

this zone is approximately hetween the parallels of 7° and 10° N., and thus cor-

responds with the belt of greatest atmospherical heat on the earth's surface.

That the functions of the countercurrents in the physics of the ocean are im-

portant, must, I think, be conceded. They appear to act on their eastern limits as
feeders to the equatorial currents, and, from the seasonal expansion, which has

been well traced in the Atlantic, are probably more immediately associated with

some oscillatory morement of the waters following, though perhaps only remotely

connected with, the srm's moTements in declination.

  A brief summary of the thermal conditions of the oceanic basins will now enable

lis to review the salient features of Ocean Circulation, and the more immediate

scientific position the question has assumed.

In all seas within the ton-id and temperate zones, providedany given area is not

cut off by submarine barriers from a supply of polar or glacial water, the sea-bed

is covered by a thick stratum of water 'the temperature of which is confined

between 32° and 35° F. In the Pacific Ocean this cold stratum must be derived

from antarctic sources, for the opening of Behriug Strait is too small to admitof

an appreciable efUux of arctic waters. In this ocean the cold stratum obtains

generally at depths below 9000 feet from the surface, with an almost invariable

isothermal line of 40° F. at from 2500 to 3000 feet from the surface. Similarly,

in the Indian-Ocean basin the cold stratum at the bottom is derived from

antarctic sources ; for the temperatm-e of 33°-5 F. underlies the hot surface-waters

of the Arabian Gulf

In the South Atlantic, antarctic waters, with a bottom-temperature of 31° to

33°-5F., certainly cross the equator: the bed of the North- Atlantic basin then

warms up to 35° ;' marked diversities in both the temperatures and thickness of

the successive layers of water fi-om  the  surface  downwards are found                                                                                      and in the
                                                                                                                                                          ;

central parts of the basin it is not until the vicinity of the Faroe Islands is reached

that arctic waters of an equivalent temperature to those from antarctic sources

are experienced.

   Tm-ning now to the scientific aspect of the question :
   The doctrine of a general Oceanic Tliermal Circulation assumes two general pro-

--positions : 1, the existence of a deep under-flow of glacial water from each pole to

the equator ; and, 2, the movement of the upper stratum of oceanic water from the
equatorial region towards each pole, as the necessary complement of the deep polar
rmder-flow--this double movement being dependent "upon the distm-bance of
hydrostatic equilibrium, constantly maintained by polar cold and equatorial

       heat."

         Proposition 2, in its general application as to the movement of surface-waters,

      is unquestionable ; but that of a deep under-flow from the poles, as a necessary

      complement, remains open to doubt. Proposition 1, in its wide generality, must,

     from what we know of the Pacific, be confined to the Atlantic Ocean; audit
     appears to me that it is on the interpretation of the movement of the waters in its

      northern basin that the hypothesis of a vertical circulation, and the potency of

      thermal agency in bringing it about, must be judged.

         "We have followed the movements of antarctic waters in the Atlantic to the
     40th parallel, as illustrated by the progress of icebergs ; we know that the move-
      ment deflects the strong Agulhas current, and that the cold waters well up on the
       western shore of the South-African continent, cooling the equatorial current near

      its presumed source ; the thrusting power of this body of water is therefore great.

     About the equator it rises comparatively near to tlie surface. But we now come

      to another and distinct movement, the equatorial cm-rent ; and on this, I appre-

^^ hend, the material agency of the winds cannot be denied, in forcing an enormous

      mass of siu'face-water from east to west across the ocean. The Gulf-stream re-
      sults ; and the comparative powers of this stream, as especially influencing the
     climate of our own and neighbouring countries, together with the forces at work

to propel its warm waters across the Atlantic, have become the controversial field

for the upliolders of horizontal and vertical circulation. The one hj'pothesis as-
signs to the Gulf-stream all the beneficent power of its genial warmth, extend-
ing even beyond the North Cape of Europe, which has been conceded to it from
the time of Franklin. The other hypothesis reduces its capacity and power, con-
siders that it is disintegrated in mid-Atlantic, and tliat the modified climate we
enjoy is brought by prevailing winds from the warm area surrounding the stream

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and to this has been more recently added, '· by the heating-power of a warm sub-
surface stratum, whose slow northward movement arises from a constantly re-

newed disturbance of thermal equilibrium between the polar and equatorial portions

of the oceanic area."

   Without denying the active power of tliis disturbed thermal equilibrium

--although in this special case it is an abstraction difficult to follow and giving due

weight to the manj^ cogent facts which have been brought forward in support of

both views, there appears to be still a connecting link or links wanting to account
for the southern movements of arctic waters; which movements, to me, are even

more remarlvable as phj'sical phenomena than the translation of the warm waters

from the Gulf-sti-eam area to a high northern latitude.

   This movement of arctic waters is forciblj'' illustrated by the winter drifts down

Davis Strait of the ships 'Resolute,' 'Fox,' 'Advance,' and apart of the crew of

the ' Polaris,' when enclosed in pack ice, exceeding in some cases a thousand miles;
similarly by the winter drift of a part of the German expedition of 1870, down the
east side of Greenland, from the latitude of 72° to Cape Farewell. If to these ex-
amples we add the experience of Parry in his memorable attempt to reach the
North Pole from Spitzbergen in the summer of 18j!7, it must be inferred that a

perennial flow of surface-water from the polar area into the Atlantic obtains, and,

judging from the strength of the winter northerly winds, that the outflow is pro-

bably at its maximum strength in the early months of the year.
   When we further know that the northern movement of warm waters gives in

winter a large accession of temperature to the west coast of Scotland, to the Fiiroe

islands, and, extending to the coasts of Norway, as far as the North Cape, the con-
sideration arises whether this onward movement of waters from southern sources

is not the immediate cause of displacement of the water in the polar area and its

forced return along the channels indicated by those winter drifts to which I have

referred.

That some unlooked-for and unsuspected cause is the great agent in forcing

mysouthern waters into the Atlantic polar basin has long forced itself on  convic-

tion and I now suspect it is to the cause producing the annual A'ariations in the
                        ;

sea-level (for, as I have mentioned, indications exist of the seas of the northern

hemisphere having a higher level in winter thin in summer) that we must direct

our attention before thi3 full solution of Ocean Circulation is accepted.

   The facts of the annual changes of sea-level, whatever they may ultimately proA'e,

have hitherto ranged themselves as a part of tidal action, and so escaped general

attention. Physicists well know the complication of tidal phenomena, and, if one
may be permitted to say, the imperfection of our tidal theory certain it is that

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the tides on the ICuropean coasts of the Atlantic are so far abnormal, that one of

our best authorities on the subject (Sir William Thomson) describes them (in re-

lation, 1 assume, to tidal theory) as "irregularly simple," while the tides in all

other seas " are comparatively complicated, but regular and explicable." However

tliis ma}^ be, specialists should direct tlieir attention to the disentanglement of the

variations in the sea-level from tidal action simple ; and our colonies, especially
tliose in the southern hemisphere, would be excellent fields for the gatheriug-in of

reliable observations.

I am unwilling to leave the subject without tracing some of the consequences

that might be fairly considered to follow this assumed change of level in the

WeNorth-Atlantic basin.  can by it conceive the gradual working-up of the

warmed water from southern sources as the winter season approaches, including :

the expansion of the Gulf-stream in the autumn months; the consequent welling-

np of a head of water in the enclosed and comparatively limited area northward of
Spitzbergen, Greenland, and the broken land westward of Smith Sound ; the

forced return of these glacial -n-aters, tlieir greatest volume seeldng tlie most direct

course, and thus worLing down the Labrador coast charged with ice and 2)assiug

the American coast inside the Gulf-stream ; while the smaller volume, reaching

the higher latitudes in mid-Atlantic, interlaces with the warm barrier waters,
causing those alternating bauds of cold and warm areas familiar to us from the

'Lightning' and 'Porcupine' observations, and which are now being worked out

by the Norwegian exjjloring expedition in the Government ship ' "S'uringeu.'

  We can further conceive that the lai'ger function of the " couutercurrents " on

the north margin of the great equatorial streams is to act as conduits for the sur-

charged waters of the northern oceans consequent on the gradual changes of level.

The Atlantic countercm'rent, we know, expands markedly in the autumnal season;

and there maj^ be some connexion between this expansion and the high level of the

waters said to exist in the Gold-Coast and Guinea bights at the same season.

  We are thus, as it appears to me, now only on the threshold of a large field of

inquiry bearing on the Physical Geogra])hy of the Sea ; but we have this advan-

tage : the admirable discussions which have taken place in the past few years,

productive as they have been of the marshalling hosts of valuable facts, will lighten

the labours of those who engage in the prosecution. Science is deeply indebted to,
and, I am sure, honours, those who have so earnestly worked on the opening pages

of the coming chapter on Ocean Circulation.

  Unwillingly I turn from this interesting subject ; but the demands on my time
and your patience are imperative, as, following precedent, it is incumbent on mo

brietly to bring under the review of the Association the latest unrecorded incidents

in geographical progress or research.

   There is one absorbing topic wdiich, in the course of a few weeks, or even days,

may attract general interest. I refer to accounts of our Arctic Expedition. It is
possible that, while I am now addressing you, the ships ' Alert ' and 'Discovery,'
lavoured by tine seasons, may have, in their endeavours to reach high northern
latitudes, accomplished all that human skill and energy can do, and, by fortuitous

circumstances, secured their return southward through Smith Sound, with the same

facility, we have reason to hope, as they entered what we suppose to be that
notable gateway to the Pole. If so, they are now fairly in Davis Strait, homeward

bound. AVc must not regard this estimate of progress as visionary ; for, the con-
ditions being favourable, the time at the disposal of the voyagers is ample. It is

the varying conditions of arctic seasons, we must remember, that baffle the fore-

casts of the most experienced arctic experts.

   Should unfavourable conditions, or the decision of the Chief, detain the ships

another year in their icy quarters, wo have reason to hope that advices will reach

us of their whereabouts in the spring of this year. The spirited enterprise of the

well-trained arctic navigator, Allan Young, supported as he has been by the

Government, offers a sure guarantee that the leaders Nares and Stephenson will

be ably seconded in their eiforts to keep up communication with their countrymen.

Here again we must not forget that baffling conditions may defeat the intentions

of the commanders to communicate in time witli the depots at the portals of
Smith Sound.

This prolonged banishment from intercourse with the outer world, howe^-er, was

a contingency anticipated and provided for by that able Committee of arctic

oflicers who, with a full sense of their responsibiiity, so fully advised the Govern-

Ament in every phase of this national undertaking.                                                             Parliamentary paper, pub-

lished during this session, gives the fullest particulars relating to the progress of

the expedition and the steps Avliich have been taken to connnunicate with their

depots. There is a long chain of contingencies to be attended to, as will be seen

on reference to tlie  interesting  details  therein given                                                      but I ventiuc to think that
                                                                                                            ;

not a link is missing, either in the conception or in the means provided, to bring

the undertaking to a successful issue.

 --There is one feature to be kept in view which from the exceptional conditions

of ship-navigation in the icy regions of the far north is rarely realized, unless by

tliose who l!a\e had actual experience in polar service ; and it is this, that between

the time of tlie disruption of the old ice in August and the formation of tlie new

in September, there exists a very short period when ships are free to move. This

peiiod of open or partially open water may be shortened by unfavourable circum-

stances, and vice  verm                             it  may  be  assumed, however, that  in  a  straight fairway

channel such as Smith Sound, it almost always does occur; and as the return

southward, on account of the drift, is always more easily accomplished than the

advance north, the great probability is that, if the ships remain out another year,

it will he the result of design rather than accident.

   By the Parliamentary papers relating to the expedition it will be seen that, in

the event of the non-arrival of the ' Alert ' and ' Discovery ' during the autunni
of this year, a relief ship will be despatched to a rendezvous in Smith Sound during

the summer of 1877.
   With regard to Africa, exploration and discovery have proceeded with accele-

rated strides during'the past few years. Even since the recent date of Cameron's
remarkable journey across the continent, important additions have been made to

the rapidly-lilling-up map of the interior. Most of these additions relate to the
great lakes, regarding which our knowledge was previously very incomplete and
unsatisfactorv. Thus Mr. Young, the experienced Zambesi traveller, Avho under-
took last year to lead the Scotch "Missionary party to Lake Nyassa, has succeeded,

after establishing the missionary settlement " Livingstonia" at tlie southern end

of the lake, in reaching in a ste'am-launch the northern end of this great fresli-

water sea, finding it to be fully one hundred miles longer than was previously

believed. His journey was made in February of the present year; and in the
following montii the still more imperfectly known lake, Albert Nyanza, was suc-
cessfully navigated by two boats under Signer Gessi, who was despatched for this
purpose" by Colonel Gordon, the present Governor of the new equatorial province

of the Khedive's dominions. The details of Signer Gessi's interesting exploration,

communicated by himself to the President of the Royal Geographical Society,

have only recently reached England ; and it is proposed to read them in the course

of the present meeting.

  A third and equally important exploration of the same class is that performed

during the same early months of the present year by that energetic traveller Mr.

Stanley. After circumnavigating the much larger neighbouring lake, Victoria,

and proving Speke's much-disputed estimate of its dimensions to be approximately

correct, he pushed his way across the difficult tract of country separating the

Victoria and the Albert lakes, reaching the shores of the latter in the middle of

January. Less fortunately situated than .Signer Gessi, who embarked on the lake

two months later, Stanley was imable to launch his boat on the then unexplored

Asouthern portions of its waters.                            comparison of the accounts of the two travellers

shows that we are yet far from knowing the true dimensions of this great sheet of

water. Signer Gessi in fact did not reach its southern extremity; aud as Mr.

Stanley appears to have struck its shores at a point about thirty miles_ further
south than the limits marked by the Italian traveller, the lake must be considerably

longer than 140 miles, as estimated by the latter. Stanley subsequently proceeded
south and explored the Kitangule river of Speke, thence striking for Lake Tan-

ganyika, the examination of which he intended to complete.
   A'eii/' Guinea has of late attracted some attention both at home and in the

Australian Colonies rather, however, from political than geographical considera-
                                                                                                              ;

tions. Our interest is of course in tlie latter ; and I ;:m glad the meeting will

have the advantage of the presence of a gentleman (Mr. Octavius Stone, recently

arrived in England) who has distinguished himself in the exploration of the
south-eastern shores of this distant, little-known, and barbarous region ; to him

we must refer for the latest geographical facts.
   With your permission we will now enter on the subject-matter before the

Meeting.

       By Commander V. L, Cameron, R.N., C.B.

Tlie aiitlior said that soon after entering the country from the east coaat he came

to a large plateau, 4000 feet in height, encircling Lake Tanganyika, and forming

the watershed between the Congo and the streams flowing into Lake Sangora.

Another tableland to the south rose to the height of 3000 feet. The watershed

between the two basins of the Lualaba and the Congo at that part is a large,

nearly level country, and during the rainy season the floods cover the ground

between the two rivers, and a great portion of it might easily be made navigable.

One thing he noticed in Africa was this system of watersheds, dividing the

covmtry into portions, each having its own peculiarity, and also that in each there

was a difference in the habits of the natives. Within twenty days he crossed the

Nsagra Mountains and came upon a level open country where a great quantity

of African corn was grown, the stalks of which rose to the height of from 20 to

24 feet. In this country no animal could live except the goat, the tsetse fly being-

Adestructive to all others. The principal geological formation was sandstone.

few marches brought him to Ugogo, an extensive plain broken by two ranges of

hills, composed of loose masses of granite piled together in the wildest confusion.

The soil was sandy and sterile. Coming to the country of the Ugari he found a

tribe almost identical with Unyamwesi. The principal streams of this district fall

. into the Mulgarazi, Unyamwesi was the commencement of the basin of the Congo.

 He believed that the natives of Unyamwesi were of the Malay race ; they had crossed

a great deal with negi'oes, and had lost the distinctive colour and distinctive marks

of the race, but their features were much the same as the dominant races in Mada-

gascar. Ugaro is a large plain very nearly quite flat. The people here were

different from the L^nyamwesians ; they had not got tlie same features or the

same tribal marks. After passing over the mountains of Komendi, which are an off-

shoot of the mountains round the soutli end of Tanganyika, they came to a" fertile

laud, much of it laid waste by the ravages of a neighbouring tribe. All the moun-

tains in that district were of granite. There was there a large quantit}^ of salt,

and what was remarkable was that the rivers ran perfectly fresh through soil

which, when the natives dug wells, gave water which was full of salt. At Ujiji

the people are of a different race from those akeady described, as they shave their

hair diii'erently and have not the same features. Along Lake Tanganyika in some

places there were enormous cliffs and hollows of rugged granite lying in loose

boulders in other places the cliffs were of red sandstone, and in others a sort of
                                                ;

limestone and dolomite. At one place he saw exposed on the shores of the lake

large masses of coal. Passing down to the south end of the lake, he found it

regularly emljedded in cliffs 500 to 600 feet high, with waterfalls discharging

themselves down the face.

Travelling ahmg the side of the lake he came to the Lukogo, a large river more

than a mile wide, but partly closed by a sort of sill on which a floating vegetation

was growing, a clear passage, however, being left of about 800 yards. After pro-

ceeding some four miles up the river, the author's boat got jammed amongst the

floating vegetation which grows to the thiclmess of two or three feet, and it wa.s

witli difficulty the boat was extricated. The Kasongo country was next reached,

the principal characteristic of which was the extraordinary trees, of which boats

a fathom wide are sometimes made. Crossing the mountains of Bambara he

arrived at Mamyuemba. Here he found the race entirelv different from any thing

 he had yet seen. The houses were differently built, the people were differently^
 armed, dressed their head differently, and there was no tattooing to speak of. The
 villages were built in king streets thirty or forty yards wide, two or three streets

 --being alongside each other, and a space left between the houses, which were of

 reddish clay, with sloping thatched roof the only houses of that description he saw
 in the interior of the country. All the Mamyuembans are cannibals. Journeying-
 northwards, but still in Mamyueniba, a district was reached where iron was very

 plentiful, and where large forges were at work. Many of the spears and knives

 which they turned out looked as if finished oft" by a file or polished by some means,
 although all done by hand-forging and patient labour. The Lualaba River was
 next reached, which is about 1800 yards in breadth. The southern shore is occu-

 pied by a tribe called the Wagenga, who do the whole carrying business of the
 river, being the only canoe proprietors, who take for pay the products of the
country to the different markets. The young women make immense quantities of
pottery in the mud and back water, which they exchange for fish.

   After referring to a coimtry between Nywangi and Loami, where a palm-oil gi-ows

 in great profusion, the author said that he traversed Kilemba, and reached Lake
Kigongo. This lake is covered with floating vegetation, on which the people
build their houses, cut a space round about them, and so transform their habita-
tions into floating islands, so that when desirable they change the locality from
one place to another. Coming to the coast he passed through one of the most
magnificent countries in the world to look at, possessing a climate in which any
European might live. The Portuguese had been settled in this neighbourhood for
thirty years. The whole of this country was just one vast slave-field. In the
country there was a vast mineral wealth and an ordinary population that, witli
education, might be rendered very industrious instead of carrymg on a continual

warfare against each other for the purpose of obtaining slaves.

                                By Signor G. E. Ceretjti.

   After several visits to the islands and part of the mainland on the north, the author
was in 1869 sent out by Count Menabrea for the purpose of malring investigations

preliminary to the formation in New Guinea of a penal settlement ; he secured at the
same time means for turning his expedition to profit geographically. He believed
that a great part of the region from the Xulla Islands to New Guinea, and perhaps

more to the north, had been subject to very important volcanic action in an epoch

not vei-y far distant ; and one could see the work now going on, the western coast

showing gradual subsidence. But whatever the origin of the islands, they were

now covered with a vegetation which he had not found equalled in luxuriance in
any part of the world. He urged in strong terms the colonization of New Guinea.

but which varied  according-  to the  places where  they were found                                                                  secondly, those

found at from 200 to 300 miles from the land, consisting of shell and lime deposits,

and covering most of the bed of the ocean ; thirdly, those existing at other depths,
and which were of siliceous character. Observations had shown that a curious

relation existed between the nature of the deposits and the depth of the water.

It was also pointed out that in the neighbourhood of volcanic islands, and in no

other places, were found large deposits of manganese, coating the shells and other

things brought up from the bottom.

               On the Islands of the Coral Sea. By Kerry Nichols.

   The Coral Sea embraces that portion of the Pacific Ocean extending from the

south of New Guinea, westward to the coast of Australia, southward to New Cale-
donia, and eastward to the New Hebrides. The New Hebrides' banks and Santa-

Cruz Islands, the author said, are an almost continuous chain of fertile volcanic
islands, extending for a distance of 700 miles, between the parallels of 9° 45' and
20° IG' south latitude, and the meridians of 1G5° 40' and 170° 33' east longitude.
Espiritu Santo, the largest island of the archipelago, was seventy-five miles long
and forty miles broad. The geological formation of the islands was composed of
volcanic and sedinientar}- rocks. I'he chain of primary volcanic upheaval might be
traced running in a general course longitudinally through the islaifds always in
their longest direction, the-axis of eruption being marked by active and quiescent

volcanoes. On the north end of the island of Vanu Lava there were extensive
springs of boiling water, solfataras, and fumaroles. The hot springs were of two

--kinds : some were permanent fountains where water was in a constant state of

ebullition, others were only intermittent, and the water became heated at certain
intervals, when it varied from a tepid degree of heat to boiling-point. The phy-
sical features of the islands were remarkably bold, and betokened at first sight their
volcanic origin. The plains, tablelands, and valleys of the mountain region were,
many of them, of considerable extent.

   The paper gave a narrative of the author's observations made in the course
of a journey in Tunis over places visited by Bruce about 1763. There had been
recently put into Col. Playfair's hand for publication a large number of Bruce'a
sketches, of which his I'arbary sketches ware, he said, the most interesting, form-
ing about 120 sheets of drawings, completely illustrating the archceology of North
Africa. In these circumstances, the author had determined to follow Bruce in
his journey, and to satisfy himself as to the present condition of those interesting
ruins, which were almost unlmown to the modern traveller.

On some Points of Interest in tJie Physical Conformation and Antiquities of tlie
                       Jordan Vallei/. By Professor Poetee.

   The general geological structure of the valley, the author said, was lime, and of the
same age as the basin of the Sea of GaUilee, and its surface was flat. The breadth
varied from three to ten miles, extending a little towards the east ; and from the
nature of its thick alluvial covering, it was of more recent formation than the
mountains, of which the soil was the deposit, the vallej' having been at one time ap-
parently a lake. The River Jordan, as it at present existed, could have had nothing

to do with the formation of the valley itself He recommended to tlie notice of
men of science that geological remains on the site of Sodom and Gomorrah pointed

to an explosion of bitumen much later than the ordinary geological formation, and

probably within the historic period.

Notes on the River Putumayo or I^d, SontJi America. By A. Snrsox.

On his Eecent Journeys in New Guinea, By Octatius Stone.

The island extends in a south-easterly direction for a distance of over 1400 milf\'a,

having a maximum width of 450 miles and a minimum of only 20. The neigli-

bourhood of the Baxter River and the entire shores to tlie west of the Papuan Gulf,

for an average of 100 miles inland, were low and more or less swampy, being inter-

sected by watercourses and covered with forests of mangrove-ti'ees. This part of

the country was thinly populated by the Dande Papuans, who iu consequence were

subjected to periodical raids from the adjoining islands of Borgu, Scaibai, and

Daun, the invaders generally returning victorious with the heads or jaw-bones of

their slaughtered victims. The only trace of cultivation he saw v/as 80 miles up

the river, where a space of six acres liad been neatly fenced round and planted

with yams, taras, sugar-cane, and tobacco. Outside the enclosure were two or

three uninhabited bark huts, which appeared to afford shelter to these ro'\inf

people, in which they prolonged their stay as game was more or less plentiful.

Traces of wild boar and kangaroo were observed in tlie Upper Baxter. No other

large animal was known to exist. They were hunted with the bow and barbed

arrow, while the war-arrows were poisoned by steeping in tlie putrid carcase of a

victim until sufficiently saturated. The district of the Baxter River contrasted

strikingly witli the Fly River discovered by Capt. Evans, whose banks for GO miles
swarmed with human beings. The author's impression of the western coast was

tliat it would prove a grave to such Europeans as sliould choose to reside there.

This part of the country was inhabited by the Papuan race, a dark race of people,

though not so dark as the ^\.ustralian negro, and one of cannibal propensities. The

eistern peninsula, on the other hand, was inhabited by the ISIalay race. Of this

race the author tliought they had come to New Guinea from islands further east,

8 mie of them making the change at a comparatively recent date. This race was

fir above the savage, botli in intellectual and moral attributes. They were culti-

vators of the soil, each having his own plantation, and strongly opposed to tlie

caunibalisni and polygamy which obtained among their western neighbours the

Papuans. The women, too, of the Malay race were not debased as among the

dark race, but mixed witli the men, with whom they shared the management of

public affairs. The Owen Stanley mountains ran through the centre of the country,

from soutli to north                                                                                            and the  east  country was,  on  tlie whole, favourable  to culti-
                                                                                                             ;

vation, and probably possessed great mineral wealtli. It accordingly offered suffi-

cient inducement for colonization ; but colonization, if attempted, would requij e to

be set about with much previous consideration, owing to the peculiar situation of

the peninsula and the circumstances of the people.

On the Temperature obtained In the Atlantic Ocean during the Cruise of H.M.S.

                ' Challenger.' By Staff-Commander Tizaeb, B.N.

--Over a gveat portion of the Atlantic the bottom temperature has this peculiarity:
   If the depth be less than 2000 fathoms, we find tlie temperature at tlie bottom

lower than that of any intermediate depth ; but when the depth exceeds 2000
fathoms, we find that the bottom temperatures are nearly the same as they are at

that depth. This holds good for three fourths of this ocean. In the remaining

fourth the temperature obtained at the bottom is much lower than in the other

parts ; and this fourth is not at cither extreme, where there is a large current of

surface cold, but occupies the whole of the western portion of the South Atlantic

--as far north as tlie Equator. The residts of these temperatures may be classihed

thus : If an imaginary line be drawn from French Guiana to tlie westernmost island

of the Azores, and from thence nortli on tlie westeim side of this line, the bottom

temperatures at depths exceeding 2000 fathoms are 35° ; that is, taking the mean

of all the temperatures obtained, which differ but slightly. On the eastern side of

this line the bottom temperatures  are 35°'3                                     and tliis imiform temperature appears
                                                                              ;

to extend as far south as Tristan d'Acimha, as the German frigate ' Gazelle ' ob-

tained similar bottom temperatures eastward of the line joining that island with

Ascension to the southward of a line "joining Tristan d'Acimha with the Cape of

Good Hope. The bottom temperatures are decidedly colder between the eastern

coast of South America and a line joining Tristan d'Acuuha and Ascension Island
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and from the Equator to the southward the bottom temperatures were invariably

colder than at any intermediate depth. These temperatures varied from 31° to

33°'5, that i^, when the depth exceeds 2000 fathoms ; and temperatures of less

than 33° were found as far north as the Equator, while a few miles northward

this bottom temperature was 3o°. It therefore appears that in the western portion

of the South Atlantic the highest bottom temperature is less than the lowest

obtained elsewhere in this ocean, excepting where tlie very low result of 29° was

found by the ' Porcupine ' in 18G9 between the Faroe Isles and the north extreme

of Scotland. The question thus arises as to the causes which confines this cold

water to the bottom portion of the western half of the South Atlantic. The

examination of the soundings which had been taken in this ocean, combined with

the results of their temperature, leads to the conclusion that there is a series of

ridges dividing its bed into two basins, one of which occupies the whole of the

western portion of the North Atlantic, while the other extends the whole of the

length of the ocean on its eastern side, and that the cold water in the western

portion of the South Atlantic is owing to there being no obstruction between the

bed of this portion of the ocean and the Ijed of the Antarctic basin ; and from the

results of the serial temperatures' soundings it would appear that these ridges can-

not exceed 1850 or 2000 fathoms in depth. To ascertain the thermal condition cf

the Atlantic ffrom the surface to the bottom), serial temperatures were obtained

iu the ' Challenger' at 150 positions, observations having been made at each ICO

fathoms to 1500 fathoms iu depth, and frequently at, sa}-, 10 fathoms to 200 fathoms

in depth, at each of these positions. An examination of these temperatures shows

that between the parallels of 40° N. and 40° S. there is a much larger amount of
warm water in the North than in the South Atlantic, and that in the equatorial

regions the isotherm of 00° is much nearer the surface tlian in the temperate zones,

but that the isotherms below G0° are at nearly as great a depth at the Equator as

in any part of the South Atlantic, especially at the isotherm of 40°, and that

between the ])arallel of 30° and 40° N. latitude the isotherm of 60° occupies a

depth of 300 fathoms over an area of 1,200,000 square miles, while the average

depth of this isotherm between the parallels of 30° and 40° S. latitude is IGO fathoms

also that the isotherm of 40°, which is at an average depth of 800 fatlioms across

the North Atlantic, between the parallels of 30° and 40° N. latitude, occupies only

--half that depth in any part of the South Atlantic. This phenomenon may be ex-

plained in the following manner : The power oi the sun indirectly heating the water

below the surface appears not to extend below 100 fathoms even in tlie tropics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

salt water at its temperature of cougelation is denser tliau at any higher tempera-
ture, its weight would cause it to sink ; and it would in time, did no other cause
intervene, occupy the whole of the space in the ocean not influenced hy the sun's

heat. But in considering the effect of the heat imparted to the surfaces, we have

also to consider the effect of evaporation and precipitation. In the equatorial
regions evaporation is rapid, so that the surface-hlm would become cleared through
increased salinity were it not for the increased temperature and large precipitation,
as well as to its being transported by the friction of the trade-winds and eartli's
motion to the westward. This surface-film, constantly moving westward in the
equatorial regions, meets in the Atlantic with an obstructing point of the South-
American continent, which directs it to the northward, so that the greater part of
the water directly heated by the sun's rays in the tropical regions is forced into the

North Atlantic. As the salinity of this water is greater than that of the subjacent

layers, and its increased temperature only renders it less dense, directly a portion
falls in temperature in the colder regions of the temperate zone, the surface-
film sinks and imparts heat to the water beneath. Consequently the isotherms
will be foimd at greater depths where the heated smface-tilms are constantly
descending than when, owing to their being less dense than the subjacent layers,
they remain on the surface.

          ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

Address hy Sir Gteorge Campbell, K.C.S.L, M.P., D.C.L., President of the
                                               Economic Section.

I FEEL a difiiciilty in imdertaking the Presidency of this special and important

Department of the British Association, in this great city, which contains so

many men masters of so many branches of economic subjects. But, Scotchman

as I am, I have felt that I could not decline the honour proposed to me in the

commercial capital  of my own country                                                                             and  I  remember with  pride  that  perhaps
                                                                                                               ;

in no place in the British Empire could economic subjects be discussed with

so great advantage. Other places have special industries. Glasgow has many,-

and she excels in them all.

I tmderstand it to be the object of the Association that in the treatment of the

subjects presented to us we should stiidy, in this as in other departments, to follow
as far as may be a strictly scientific method of inquiry, not lapsing into the di.s-

cussion of political details, but attempting to ascertain the principles on which

economic results are founded, and to define the niaiu lines of economic truth. It

may not always be possible to draw the boundary between science and practice
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;
but I am  sure  that we  shall  all try as                                                                        much as  possible to  avoid matters
                                                                                                                                                       which

involve party or personal questions, and to maintain a calm and scientific attitude

in our treatment of the many subjects which come within the range of this

Section.

The Section was originally called that of " Statistics ;" and all economic inquiry

must be based on or tested by Statistics. At first sight Statistics expressed in figm-es
might seem to constitute the most exact of sciences ; but in practice it is far other-

wise. In nothing is so great caution necessary ; there is too gi-eat temptation to
reduce to figures facts which are themselves not sufficiently ascertained ; too often
an exactness is claimed for these figured results which is altogether fallacious and

misleading. In fact there is a use and an abuse of figm-es ; and one is sometimes

tempted to sympathize with the cynical philosopher who said that nothing is

more misleading than facts, except figures. It is especially necessary to distinguisli

between figures which are really ascertained, and those which are nierely drawn by

Adeductions from rough and conjectural facts.                                                                              false appearance of exactness
                                                !

should not be giveu to these latter. For instance, if we take the geographical

area of a country to he so much, and assume the density of population to be at a

certain rate per sq^uare mile, we may work out a very precise figure, and yet in

reality the result is not at all precise.

   There is very often fear that Statistics are sought out and adapted to suit a pre-
conceived theorv. Another misuse of Statistics is this, that Avhen they are used
to test certain capacities and qualifications work is directed and shaped to meet the
statistical test, and the results thus obtained become misleading. In such a case

it is necessary very frequently to change the form in which the statistical test is

applied.

Eearing in mind, however, the necessity of guarding against abuse, there can

be little doubt that statistical science is one of the most important instruments

and necessities of our time, especially in this country, in which we are somewhat

deficient in that science. First, we require statistics for the direct ascertainment

of facts for practical use; for instance, the statistics of production. Agricidtural

and manufacturing statistics are of the greatest practical importance to the fiirmer
Weand the mauufactiirer.
                          are almost wholly destitute of agricultural statistics.

How o-reat is the contrast in America and other countries, where great attention is

paid to these subjects, and every farmer iu the country is kept informed of very

much that it is most important for him to know

But there is a second and almost more important use of Statistics, viz. the culti-

vation of economic science by the inductive method. It is by collecting, verifying,

and classifying facts that we are able to approach economic truth. There was a
time when itleems to have been supposed that political economy was a science

reo-ulated by natiual laws so fixed that safe results could be attained by deductive
reasoning. But since it has become apparent that men do not in fact invariably

follow the laws of money-making pure and simple, that economic action is aflected
by moral causes which cannot be exactly measured, it becomes more and more

evident that we cannot safely trust to a chain of deduction, we must test every

step by an accurate observation of facts, and induction from them. This is, it

seems "to me, the highest function of statistical science : we recognize that men
are not mere machines whose course may be set and whose progress may be
calculated by a simple formula. Men are complicated beings, whose minds and
motives of action we do not vet thoroughly understand ; we cannot foretell what

they will do till we are siu-e 'that we know what in fact they actually have done
and do iu a gi-eat variety of circumstances. In proportion as we attain that

knowledge, we become acquainted with the main agent in economic science, and

make advances towards a knowledge of that science.

When we seek to understand economic history and economic institutions, it is
seldom that all the necessary materials are ready to hand in our own countiy and
Weour own aue. AVe must search for them far and wide.
                                                       seek to recover

economic history, geuerallv very imperfectly recorded in times when the science

was little understood. And at"the same time there is a kind of contemporaneous
Wehistory of which very much use may be made.       may obser\e facts, and may

obtain statistics iu countries which are in stages of human and economic history

very different from our own. As the history of plants and animals is recovered
from geological records, so we may recover "much of human history by studying
m Weuian
          the earlv. middle, and more advanced stages of civilization.  of this

country, who rule over so manv lands in so many parts of the world, have special
opportunities for this kind of economic study. In my own experience I have been

particularly struck bv the light thrown on our institutions by a comparison with

those lately and now existing among the different peoples of India. India is in
truth a country of manv peoples, aud'there is there infinite material for the human
archreologist who would study the earlier phases of human history among the

primitive" aboriginal tribes, still iu what I would call the earher stages of
              may there learn much of the origin of the institutions which we

allude to one or two points in what I call the middle history of man, directly

leading to our modern institutions, in respect of which I think that much may he

learned from ohservation in India. And in India we are not now left to mere
Aindividual observation only.
                               very substantial commencement has been made

towards the introduction of statistical science and the collection of statistics of

tolerable value, in that country. For some years past great attention has been paid

to this subject by the Government. I may venture to say that I mj^self, when I

held office in that country, have done all that was in my power to promote statistical

Icuowledge ; and a number of earnest men have done the like. As usual in the

commencement of such inquiries, our difficulty has not so much been to get figures

as to keep our statistical figures down to those which are pretty reliable. '\\'u
are thoroughly aware of the necessity of caution in thi.s respect ; and we believe
that we are gradually coming to the point when we can say that we have .some

very valuable statistics on a very large scale.

   Of the history and use of local Institutions we may learn very much in India.

That covmtry was, locally speaking, one of the most self-governed cuuutries in the

world, in native times. In all parts of this ifslaud, while the civic constitutions of

the ancient Burghs have been preserved, the self-governing institutions of the

country at large have almost entirelj' disappeared, leaving only a few fossil remains

to testify to theii" previous existence. On the continent of Europe the old Com-
munes retain a good deal of vitalitj'. But it is in India under native rule tluit we

see these institutions in full \ig-our and working order. That little republic, the

villa'^e comnmnity of India, has come to be looked on as an interesting old relic

rather than as the subject for modern imitation. In my opinion we may draw
from it a very large store of economic knowledge which may be very useful to us.

1 orieve to say that philistine and self-satisfied as we are, prone as we are to believe

that there can be no good thiiigthat is not our own, instead of supporting and cheiish-

ing the self-governing Indian Communes, and taking from them an example

for om" own country, we are permitting them to fall into decay. They owed in fact

their cohesion and their durability to pressure from without, to the necessity of

the case, which made self-government indispensable to tlieir existence. Our strong
arm has removed that external pressure ; and in our self-confident spirit we ha\e

substituted our pretentious but imperfect and uncertain Courts for the rough but

reliable village rule of former days. I believe that the more we introduce into
India true economic science, the more it will be apparent that wo have taken on

om'selves too heavy a burden, that too great centralization is a mistake, and

that, in a country where political fi-eedom on a large scale is impossible, tlie only

satisfactory resom-ce is a large measure of the local government to which the

people are accustomed.

The tenure of land is another subject on which great liglit is thrown by Indian

experience. After an intimate acquaintance with the tenvues which we there
find in existence, and those which our system has created, we seem to have before

us a picture of the rise and progress of property in land. Putting aside the older

forms of property, we have had in India many examples of the feudal tenure

of a conquered country by chiefs and subchiefs holding in subordination one to

another and ruling over communities of cidtivators, some of whom were free and

possessed of certain rights and privileges, and others were in a servile position.

Among the communities holding land Ave have manifest traces of the old sjsteni

of partition and repartition ; we have before our eyes the gradual disuse of that old

system and the gradual growth of the individual tenure of the lands under the

plough with commoh use of the pasture-lands, the wood, and the water, on a

Wetenure strictly analogous to that of English Commons.  ha-\-e the struggle

between the Lords and the Commoners, and questions between tlie Commoners and

the landless members of the communitj', just as we have luid in this country.

Then we have the growth of English ideas of property in land. "We have tlie
moverlord, the Zemindar, no longer holding
                                            feudal tenm-e and receiving

Wecustomary dues and services, but turned by us into a rent-receiver.  have the

struggle of the rent-receiver influenced by our ideas to turn the privileged culti-

vator into a tenant pure and simple, to appropriate the Commons and to establisli

Weabsolute property.    have the emancipation of some cultivators as copyholder!;.

the subsidence of otliers put into rackrented tenants-at-will, aud tliou into laboiu'ers.

All these stages in the tenure of laud we have in the Indian couulries where the

Zemindar system has prevailed. In other parts of India, whore the Government

has recognized the rights of and dealt with the llyots direct, wc haA'e the rapid

development of small property in land with all the incidents of that form of

property witli which in many parts of Europe we are familiar.
   Then we have another process goiug on in all properties, small aud great.

At tii'st the holders of the land are content to pay, as they ahvays have paid to

native rulers, the hulk of the rent to the State or to the feudal lord, retaining for
themselves only certain dues and perquisites. Under our system the State rent

                                              ;

is limited ' a portion of it is surrendered to the landholders. From time to time,

luider the influence of English ideas, that portion left to the holder of the land is

increased. In one great province the assessment rendered perpetual in the last

century has become so light as to be rather a moderate land-tax than a rent. In

other provinces a moderate assessment fixed for a very long period becomes a very

light assessment before the end of that period ; as the country progresses and

values increase, the share of the landholder becomes larger e^ery day ; he learns

to spend that share. When the time for revision of assassmeut comes he resists

any very large or sudden increase ; and the Government more and more yields to
his demands. Thus gradually property in land in the English sense is established.

Tenancy by capitalist farmers under capitalist landlords we have not yet come to

in India.

   The subject of small cultivation seems to derive a new interest in a new quarter
from what is now taking place in regard to the emancipated Africans in the I nited
States of America and elsewhere. I understand that the cultivation which has
already made the produce of the American cotton-districts almost or quite equal

to that before the war, is for the most the cultivation of small independent negro

cultivators, who raise cotton on a system much the same as that under which tho

Kyots of India or Metayers of Italy culti^ate small farms. There seems to be
among the dark races of India and Africa a dislike to regular hired labour, aud a

preference for independent labour on their own account, v. hich makes them prefer
small farming to service, or at all events leads to their doing better work on their
own farms. There has been, I think, a disposition to undervalue the agricultural
skill of the Indian rj-ot. And if it shoidd prove that in advanced America, under

free institutions, the cultivation of an article of great value and high quality is best

carried on by small black farmers, we may well believe that in other countries,
too, great results may be obtained by the same sj'stem. The settling down to

honest labour of the American freedmen is an example full of promise, I hope, for

the African race throughout the world. If iu all the countries where the state

of black freedmen is still uncertain they can be thus settled, a great end vvill bo

achieved. And in Africa itself we may hope tliat in countries now torn by war
and slavery a guiding hand may lead the African race to peacefid, prosperous, and

happy times.

   I merely instance these as cases in which economic problems may be studied in

their several stages in countries other than our own. I cannot attempt to pursue

these subjects at present.

    Proceeding to another branch of economical science, I cannot but think that there

has been passing before us of late a very great deal to bring home a ^iew with which

--I have before on other occasions dealt that curllj^ expressed in the homely saying

of Walter Scott, that " it is saving rather tlnxn getting that is the mother of

riches.'' What an extraordinary economic lesson is read to us in the results of the

late French war ! True, the French have been politicallj- humbled ; true, they have
been obliged to pay a w.ar indemnity of crushing magnitude. But what has fol-
lowed ? Misfortune has taught the Freiich a lesson of economy and prudence

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

triumph taught the Germans a lesson of pride and extravagance. The French
have retrieved their losses ; they are at this moment commercially the most pros-
perous people in Em'ope ; they bear without dithcidty or distress a taxation far
larger than that of any other country in the world ; while the Germans, who
launched out into extravagance on the- strength of the vast sums paid them by tho
French, ai-e suffering greatly from exhaustion and commercial collapse ; their trade
190 REPORT--1876.

is bad, their manufactiu-es are discredited, their people are disheartened. The

French are a people of small proprietors and small capitalists ; they have not the

great masses of accumulated wealth that we have in this country in the hands of

great capitalists. But their wealth is more generally distributed among the people,

and in their hands it fructifies at least as much in the end ; if there are not such

high profits, there are not such great spendings. Looking to their capacity of

bearing taxation, to the general wellbeiug of the people, to the very general pos-

session of small ]iroperty, it may well be a question whether, after all and in spite

of wars and misfortunes, France is not quite as prosperous a country as our own,

and quite as happy a country.

This at least is certain, that small people working for themselves, if they do not

earn more, at least work more zealously and save more than those who work as the

hired labourers of others. I am inclined to think that, treating the matter scien-

tiUcaUy, the facts will justify us in reducing it to a law that the small man who

works for himself is a thrifty man and saves, while the hired labourer is seldom so

Whysaving and prudent.    is this ? I think the explanation is to be found in the

habit of forethought and management which is necessarily engendered in the man

who, not lidng on daily wages, is bound in some degree to take thought for the

morrow, to calculate his ways and means, to husband his resources for a rainy day,

to make forecasts of the provision for himself and his family. To this I attribute

it that tlie small French proprietor, the Irish farmer, the Indian ryot, the Scotch

weaver (who is unhappily passing from us) are or were all saA'ing, thrifty men.

Where will you find a tetter class than the old Scotch handloom weaver, the

careful, thoughtful, well-educated, independent man, the owner of his own cottage

and patch of garden groimd, generally prudent, and alwaj's ready to hold his own

in argument ?   No doubt  modem mechanics                                     make more                                               but  do  ihev accumulate
                                                                                                                                   ;

more ? The habit of living upon weekly wages diminishes the necessity for fore-

thought. The practice of miyi-ating in search of the best market takes away the

desire to own a house and garden. I think it cannot too often be repeated that

the great economic question of the day is to reconcile the modern aiTangement of

capitalist and  workmen with sufficient  incentives to                        prudence and                                                     economy                                              that

is the problem at the bottona of all plnns of cooperation, and of most of the questions

connected with Trades' Unions and the like.

Very intimately connected, too, with this question is the great and most difficult

subject of pauperism. Poor Indian ryots manage to get on without Poor Laws

because they are prudent self-workers. The poor Irish farmers for the most part
do the same. In most European countries there are no poor laws. Yet when the

people of a country are reduced to the position of labourers poor laws become a
necessity. It is found in practice tliat people living on wages do not make the

same provision for themselves and their helpless relations that self-workers do.

There has been a strong disposition to meet this tendency by a more severe ad-

ministration of the poor laws, by driving poor people into the workhouse. I con-

fess that I doubt the efficacy of "this  system                               at any rate I think it may be carried
                                                                           ;

too ftir and I was glad to hear Mr. Walter of the ' Times ' make a manly stand
                                       ;

against it in his place in the House of Commons.

It is for us to treat the matter scientitically, and to consider the principles on

which poor-relief is foimded. The Scotch are a logical people, and they are in-

clined to take the view that payments to the poor-rates are a kind of insurance.

They pay rates when they are well-to-do, and they think they are well entitled Id

pensions' from the rates when they are disabled. Is this view a correct one P or if

not, what is the real principle of poor-rates and poor-relief ? I think that these
are questions which must be answered by those who would tike a severe view of

the relief sj'stem. I am inclined to doubt whether English doctrinaires or central

boards can "much improve on our careful and prudent system of out-door relief

administered by local bodies who thoroughly knov*^ their own people.

   Even if time permitted I would not venture to deal with great commercial
questions in the presence of those who so much better understand them ; but there
is one question of pressing importance at the present time to which I must allude,

the more as it is much connected with the 'Country of which I have a large per-

sonal knowledge, India ; I mean the silver question. He would be a bold man

indeed wlio would prophecy the value of silTer as compared with gold a few years

heuce. I certiiinly shall not attempt to do so. There are countries, China espe-

cially, of which wo know very little ; and I apprehend that the course of the silver-

lUcarket will very greatly depend on tlie action of the States of the Latin Union

and the United Slates of America. The disposition of the Government of India

seems to be to adopt a waiting policy; and there are not sufficient data to enable

any one to pronounce with contidence that this com-se is -wi-oug. " When in doubt
what to do, try how it will answer to do nothing," is a maxim of much value.

The only plan to which personally I have a little inclined is to put more silver into

the rupee and that would                                                                                          not  be  safe  till  we  are  sure  that the  change  in  the

relative value of the precious metals is permanent.

   On one point only in connexion with this subject I sliould like to say something

further. The belief has been expressed, and the Silver Committee has accepted the

suggestion, that India is likely to absorb an increased and increasing quantity of

silver for currency purposes. This I greatly doubt. It is said that in many parts

of India silver is yet little known for purposes of exchange, most transactions being

conducted by the primitive method of barter. This I think quite a mistake. I

have as vdde an experience of India as most men ; and I know no part of India
where traffic is by barter for want or ignoi-auce of coin, except the most remote

hill regions of the most savage and unexplored aboriginal tribes which are yet
hardly known even geographically. The Hindoos are a very old people ; they used

coin freely when we had none ; and they have not forgotten the use of it. I should

say that the special feature of their transactions is the use of a great deal of coin in

cases where we should iise notes, cheques, or bills. And nw impression is the
opposite of that which has been suggested. I am inclined to think that as more
modern ways are learned less coin will be required, not more. When I first went

to India very large quantities of coin were hoarded. Every prosperous native

prince who managed his finances well according to native ideas hoarded very large
sums in coin. On the occasion of successions, minorities, and otherwise we ascer-

tained the reality of these hoards. The weight and power of a prince or noble was

estimated by his store of treasure. So in grades below, there was much disposition

to put  by stores of rupees                                                                                       and the prosperous peasant, like the Frenchman, either
                                                                                                               ;
--buried rupees in his hut or made them into ornaments for his family a little

capital to be converted into cash when necessity arose. Till very recently paper
money was wholly unknown ; and even yet it is used but to a very minute" degree

compared with its use in European countries.

  Now that the country is more opened up every day, that there is more confidence

in the British peace, that new channels of enterprise, new wants and idesis are

developed, I believe that the habit of hoarding coin diminishes. Natives, princes,

and nobles spend their money in many new ways. When they accumulate they

lend it to the British Government to make railways in their territories, or mider-

tiike enterprises of their own, or put it in " Government paper." Smaller people

travel by railway, enter into speculations, and utilize their money instead of hoarding

it. Li one direction, as people become richer the ornaments on their wives and

children may become more valuable ; but in another direction, there is less hoarding

of capital in this form.

In a country where the coin of legal tender is so bullcy as silver there is much

greater occasion to use paper money freely than where the cm-rency is gold. I see
not why, as confidence in our notes increases, they may not come to be used ten,

or twenty, or fifty times as much as at present, why notes for large sums and silver

for smaller sums shoidd not dmstitute the currency for transactions above

those for which copper suffices. If the tendency of things should be at all in the

direction which I have indicated, it would follow that while we might understand

the absorption of a vast amount of silver in the past half century, we might also

suppose that the tendency thus to absorb that metal will not continue.

I would ask your permission now to turn for a moment to the subject of educa-

tion, and to suggest that here of all things there is the amplest room for substituting

scientific inquiry and a scientific treatment of that great economic agency for the

empirical system hitherto followed. Ij.et us try to work out what are the "objects of

education, and by what methods they may be best attained. How far and at. what

stages of the progress of the young human bemg is education useful as a mental
o-ymuastic, and how far and when as a means of communicating positive knowledge

to be retained. As a mental gymnastic, which are the faculties most to be culti-
vated ? and in which, boys or girls, are particular faculties to he drawn out ? Can

--we classify and distinguish the faculties of the mind distinguish memory from the

reasuniug power for instance ?

   I am inclined to think that imder the present haphazard sj'stem a boy generally

gets that mental training which he least wants. The boy with a good memory,

who does not need the excessive development of that faculty, does work depending

on memory because " he has a turn for it;" and his reasoning powers remain dor-

mant for ever. The only boy whoso reasoning powers are exercised by Euclid is
the rare boy who has a ii(rn for that sort of thing, and who does not need such

a gymnastic.

  Then, when we come to the acquisition of knowledge, can we not distinguish

the knowledge to be turned to use in after life ? Is there no distinction in the

teaching of boys destined for one sphere of life or another ? In England, at any

rate, do not the chains forged by degrading endowments tie down almost all to

the same dull routine ? Is the knowledge of the things, the creatures, and the

uses of the world put in due proportion to mere empirical learning ? I ask all

these questions without pretending to answer them ; but I do again venture

to suggest that education at present, of all things, requires scientific inquiry and

Wescieutilic treatment.  must even, in dealing with education, go to the bottom

of things, and inquire how far qualities are born, and how far they are produced

by association and education.

   As regards the education and employment of women, is not -there great
room for scientific inquirj' on the question how far the mind of woman differs from

that of man ? Is there not, in fact, a very considerable mental difference between

man and woman, just as there is a considerable bodily difference ? Is not woman,
to some extent at least, a different creature from man, so that v.c may in some
sort predicate that under certain conditions a man will act in one way and a woman
will act in another way, in tlie same manner (though not in the same degree) as we

can predicate that a dog v.-ill act in one way and a cat in another? To some
degree I am inclined to think that there is some natural difference, and that this

difference must be taken into uccoimt in determining the treatment, the employment,

and the functions of women.

   It is because I thoroughly sympathize with the desire of so many women of the

middle classes to hud useful and honourable employment for themselves that I

think scientific inquiry ijito the economic capacities of tlie creature woman most

necessary. If we can once solve that part of the problem, the rest wiU be com-

paratively easy. I feel sure that there are mar^y functions, whether they depend

on uimbleness of finger, sympathy of heart, or quickness of intellect, for which

women are especially fitted, while there are others for which tlieir nature is less

fitted and in respect of which tliey will do well to avoid an unequal rivalry with man.

  As education fits a man for his duty in the scheme of economy, so dissipation of

various kinds unfits him ; and we can hardly exclude from economic science the

efi'ect of the abuse of stimulants. I was going to say use and abuse, but I think it

may be doubtfid \\hether there is an}- real use for stimulants at all. In dealing
Avith the matler scientificallj-, it seems \ ery necessary to inquire how far the appe-

tite for various stimulants is connected with questions of race and climate, and

what is the compiirative effect of pure stimulants and those which have a narcotic
clement. It does seem that man when lie lias the chance will indulge in some

luxuries, and that di'ink cannot be stopped by preaching alone. Perhaps the best

hope of a remedy may be to discover the means by which innocuous enjoyment

may be afforded to ]:im in consonance with his constitution and tastes. It may be

a question fairly open to consideration whether the whisky of the Scotchman is or

is not as injurious as the semi-narcotic beer of the Englishman. And then we

have the larger question, whether the wholly narcotic opium of the Chinese is worse

than or as bad as the alcohol of European countries.

I have been led into the suggestion that these things are very much a matter of

race by observation of the very singular way in which in Asia the populations are
                                                                                      --;

divided into tliose who use opium aud those who use alcohol, according to race-

lines, e\en in countries where the facilities of obtaining the one or the other are

precisely similar. In the east of India I found tliat the consumption of opium in

the various districts was just in proportion as a Turanian or Chinese element pre-

vailed in the popidation. The Aryan races of India never take to opium in a very

gi-eat degree, except in the case of some of the Sikhs, whose religion prohibits the

use of tobacco. Even in the districts where the poppy is almost universally culti-

vated by the Ryots (and they supply the opium which the Chinese consume), it is a

happy fact that the native population does not take to the common use of opium

--and there are no greater symptoms of the ill effects of the drug than in districts

where it is very rare and dear ^far less so than in districts where the cultivation is

not permitted, but where there is an Indo-Chinese population. I cannot but

think that such race proclivities open up an important held of inquiry.

From so fertile sources of crime as drink and other stimulants one not unnaturally

passes to justice and the repression of crime, as essential to economic safety and

prosperity. No one who has experienced the vast relief obtained by the change

from a crude and undigested state of the law to the use of codes can doubt the

immense advantages of codification. It is very gi-eatly to be regi-etted that so

little progress in that direction has been made in this country. Not only would

there be the great direct gain, but there would be this enormous advantage, that in

a codified shape the laws of the three kingdoms might be assimilated. The very

great juridical advantages which we possess in many respects in Scotland would be

communicated to the sister kingdoms ; and, on the other hand, we should obtain in

Scotland some modern reforms which we need. "We should get rid of that shock-

ing anomaly and hindrance to business, the necessity of passing in the same legis-

lature separate laws for England and Scotland, only because there is a difference in

the legal phraseology and some of the details. I have been much struck by the ex-

treme ignorance which prevails in England regarding our Scotch criminal system.

The world is ransacked for examples in regard to such questions, as, for instance,

the examination of the accused ; and yet there is not one well-educated man in

England in a thousand who knows that in his own island, at his own door, there is

a system of criminal procedure juost radically different from his own, and, as I

Whoventure to think, veiy worthy of English imitation.  in England has the least

idea of the wholesome Scotch system under which the first inquiry includes the

examination of the prisoner before lawyers are permitted to see him, and the record

for judicial use of the statements which he makes?

After judicial inquiry comes puuishment ; and here I am inclined to believe that

the ci\dlized world is still very much at fault. I think there is still immense room

for scientific discussion on the subject of punishments. There are some gi-eat sub-

jects, such as sanitation and punishments, in respect ofwhich I believe that the experts

claim a certainty and a knowledge which has not yet been attained. On the con-

trary, I think there is still every thing to be gained by inquiry and experiment

conducted without prejudice or preconceived conclusions. I'he mere sliutting-up

a man in prison without severe treatment is by no means a sufficient deterrent to all
natures ; and when we seek to be severe, we clash with modern notions of humanity.

In one shape, indeed, there seems to be a disposition to revert to a form of torture

that is, by flogging. Yet after a great experience I am myself much convinced

that of all forms of corporal punishment flogging is the most uncertain, ineffective,

and dangerous. In a light and simple form it is good for juvenile delinquents,

whose oflences are petty, and whom we would not contaminate by a first imprison-
ment. And flogging is to some natures a material addition to other punishments.

But as soon as we try to carry it beyond this we are placed in this dilemma, that

a flogging which is safe is an insufficient punishment; a more severe flogging is a

sort of lottery : nineteen or ninety-nine men it may not harm, the twentieth or

hundredth it will kill. I really believe that it would be safer to cut off a finger or

an ear than to attempt to deal with serious oflences by floji-giug only.

It is because I think we do not yet fully understand the science of puuishment

that I am myself opposed to a too uniform and centralized system of prison manage-

ment. I thoroughly admit that there is much room for reform in regard to the

mimberofour jails and for improvement in the management of many of them.

Measures to cany out these objects I would gladly see. But, doing so mucli, I
would still both retain in tins as in other things the services of the many experi-
enced local magistrates who in this country give so much time and attention to
local business, and leave a considerable latitude for some variety of treatment and
some facility of experiment in regard to the treatment of criminals.

   I do nol attempt to go into further detail on these subjects. I am sure that it is
betterthat I should not detaiuyoulonger, but should give place to the many interesting
papers which will illustrate this Section, and which will, I trust, lead to many im-

j)ortant discussions. If the scope of this Section is somewhat wide and perhaps
less defined than that of other Sections of the Association which deal with more
precise branches of science, it at all events includes a variety of subjects of much
practical and immediate interest. If only on the subject of silver currency some
light can be shed, great good will be done. That subject will be treated by very
able hands ; and we shall have the advantage of men of great pi-actical knowledge
in discussing it. Other subjects I might mention which will be brought before j^ou
in papers of great interest ; but they will speak for themselves, and I need not
enumerate them here.

   The author stated that this was a continuation of a previous paper " On Agri-
cultural Statistics and Waste Lands." The antiquity and utility of agricultural

statistics in the far East, where thej^ operated as a stimulus to production, gave a
knowledge of their resources and averted famine. The elaborate system thereof

now adopted in our Australian colonies lie considered worthy of imitation by the
United Kingdom and all its dependencies, remarldng that the entire cost of the

Bengal famine (£0,588,000). with the saciitice of life and its demoralizing effects,
might have been prevented had a thoroughly good mcord of cultivation and its
outcome been in operation in India. Of the acreage of Great Britain and Ireland
(77,500,000) there were in 1875:--

The decrease in pigs is accounted for by the high price of barley «S:c. The import

of grain, flour, and meal in the fifty-two weeks ending August 25, 1870, was

116,018,504 cwt. It is estimated that we import about half the corn we consume,

Weand 14 per cent, of our consumption of .meat alive or cured.   consume

33,097,783 cwt. of beef, mutton, pork, hams, and bacon. Estimating the popula-

tion at 33,000,000, each man, woman, and child in the United Kingdom consumes

aununlly 114 lbs. weight of meat, exclusive of poultry, fish, game, and rabbits.

With reference to waste lands the author advocates legislative encouragement and

security for the outlay of capital, with skill and enterpiise in their cidti^ation,
where there was a reasonable prospect of a profitable residt. The returns showed

an increase of 171,479 acres in cidtivation on the preceding year, which, as far as it

went, was satisfactory. In conclusion, he observed the present tin;e is favourable to

supports it, political economy requires it, philanthropy suggests it, the money-market

favours it, tlie rate of discoxmt being but 2 per cent. "When capital and money
is a drug at 1 per cent., how can we better employ it than in the increased and

improved cidtivation of the soil, with the invaluable satisfaction of giving healthy

employment to tens of tliousands of the people, and permanently increasing the

value of our property both individually and nationally ?

                                       The Economy of Penalties.

           By the Eev. John S. Burt, Chaplain of Broadmoor Asylum.

    The problem which economy is called upon to solve, stated in its simplest terras,

 is either to achieve a given result with the least possible expenditure of force, or
with a gi\en amomit of force to achieve the greatest possible result.

    But the problem is seldom presented in a f<3rm so simple; either the greatest
attainable residt is not known, or the available force is not determined, while vari-
ations in the force used invohe compUcations with other forces, and therefore also
complicated residts. Accordingly the problem generally assumes this idterior form :
when the cost of the force used is deducted from the value of the result, to deter-
mine the point at which the excess of value is greatest.

    This is the form which the problem ultimately assumes in the economy of

penalties.

                                                                                                      I.

    The result to he attained at in the use of penalties is by no means determined.
 _ The general opinion is that penalties ought to be aimed at the complete repres-
sion of crime. This opinion was countenanced by Archbishop Whately and by ·
Mr. Beutham ; but this opinion is inexact and misleading.

    Lawlessness in a popidation is restrained powerfully by other moral forces ante-
cedent in their action to penalties. Penalties are a supplemental force ; they are
thrown in as " make-weights."

   But the incentives to crime which overpower those other antecedent forces
coimteract also the action of this supplemental force. It is a matter of imiversal

experience that the complete suppression of crime is impossible.

   ]3etween what is effected by those antecedent forces and what camiot be effected
by this supplemental force there hes an undetermined amount of preventible crime.
The prevention of more or less of this preventible crime is the residt which ought
to be aimed at by penalties.

   The amoimt of preventible crime, and the point at which the crime-rate is affected
by an increase or a decrease of penalties, is to be found by a study of what may be
called C07nparative criminality. There are great fluctuations in the rate of" the
commitments to prison among the population generally aiul in different localities.
But these fluctuations do not foUow inversely an increase or a decrease in the use
of penalties ; on the contrary, for more than half a century the amount of crime in
its graver forms, and the severity of pimishments for them, have gone on decreasing
concurrently. This is evidence that heretofore penalties have been used in excess

of their proper deterring power.

   Of the cost of penalties.

 --In an economy of penalties there are three subsidiar}- economies namely, an

economy of pain, an economy of labour, and financial economy.
   In this paper the economy of pain is alone treated of. Until the exact point is

found at which the amount of crime varies inversely with the increase or decrease
of punishment, the problem is to keep crime at a given level with the least possible

expenditure of pain.

   The infliction^ of pain in excess of what is necessary is cruelty. States canni^t
lessen the happiness of thousands of the popidation ty severe penalties without
incurring heavy costs to the nation. There is a lessening of loyalty, and there is
often a revulsion of feeling produced against the Government. There are more
than 150,000 commitments to the prisons of England and Wales every year.
--196 REPORT 1876.

There are more than 27,000 persons lying in those prisons constantly. If from
arriving at a mistaken result one third or one haK of these persons are kept in
prisons in excess of what is necessary, the amount of the nation's happiness is
lessened to an extent by no means trifling.

   In admmisteriug the penalty of imprisonment, the economy of pain leads to a
conclusion in favoiu- of compressing the penal element into shorter periods of time
under a rigorous separate discipline, instead of expandmg it over longer periods of
time in association.

   The longer sentences tell upon the faculties of prisoners ; the severe discipline

does not.

   The popular opinion that a separate discipUne camiot be prolonged beyond twelve
months is founded on error. The objection shows that the principle of the separate
system is not correctly understood. The evidence is conclusive that a separate dis-

cipline may be enforced for long terms with perfect safety. Now and then injury

to the mind may be produced, but the cases ought to be very rare. Injury both to
mind and body will occasionally result from any form of se^-ere punishment ; even

cm'ative processes sometimes do great injury.
   The use of chloroform is occasionally fatal ; but this does not overthrow the use

of it. If at any hospital the deaths from it were frequent, this woidd be evidence
that it was not admuiistered properly. It is the same witli the separate system of

prison discipUne.

   The economy of prison laboiu- and financial economy are necessarily passed over.
   If the principles ad\'ocated in the former papers were acted U2:)on, one third or
one half of the cells in county and borough prisons woxdd be left vacant.
   If the principles ad\anced in this third paper were acted upon, those vacant cells

On the present extent of Slaveri/ and the Slave Trade, with a reference to the
    Progress of Abolition since the close of the American ^Var. B// the Eov.

    AA.RON BUSACCTT.

   .Slavery now prciailed in Turkey, Egypt, Persia, Tunis, Morocco, Madagascar,

Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Affghanistan, and in the dominions of the Seyyid of Zan-
zibar, and amongst the different tribes of East and Central Africa. Every contment
shared in this great crime. In Turkey it was a vast national institution, degrading
the dignity of labour, demoralizing domestic relations, and paralyzing the iuiiuenees
of modern civilization. Portugal had the will but not the power to aboUsh slavery

throughout her territories. From GOGO to 10,000 slaves were annually conveyed
from the Portuguese coasts of Mozambique to Madagascar. Spain stood alone
among the nations of Europe in resolutely maintaining slavery in Cuba. At the
lowest estimate it was computed that 70,000 Africans yearly crossed the sea into

slaA'ery ; and, accepting Dr. Li\ ingstone's estimate of the numbers massacred by
slave-himters and perishing on the route to the sea-coast, it was computed tiiat not
less than 500,000 were annually sacrificed. The author questioned the efhcacy of

having treaties for the suppression of slavery, when these were only meant to

worry petty Arabs or African chiefs, or the Seyyid of Zanzibar, while other and
stronger nations were left to do what thej^ wished. lie then pointed out that at
tlie close of the American war 4,000,000 of slaves were set free, and he was glad
to say that ^"Vmerica at this moment was more se^-ere against complicity in slavery

tlian e-\en English law. And now that America liad lent lier influence on the side

of the slave, he thought there would be no difficult}' in abjUsliing slavery. Por-
tugal had desired tliat the slaves in some of her islands should be free, but it was
questionable whether the decree was in any measure operative. Tlie Queen of
Madagascar in 1874 issued a proclamation granting freedom to all sla-ces imported
since .lune 1805 (^the date of the treaty with Great Britain, America, and France)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but there was no evidence that one slave had been freed through that proclamation.
Even so late as last year Arab merchants openly exposed slaves for sale in the
capital, and no attempt had yet been made to give freedom to the masses of slaves

who were natives of Madagascar. After referring to the exertions made by Dr.
Kirk, tlu-ough whom the Sidtan of Zanzibar had been brought to make the treaty

with England, he said that, according to Lord Derby, the Foreign Office was in

communication with the Turkish and Egyptian Governments with a ^iew to the

.suppression of the sla'*e trade. Thus far has the sla^e trade been abolished ; but
the progress of this movement depended entirely npon a strong public opinion.

Circumstances were propitious, and an earnest eflbrt might now realize all the

sacred conditions of British freedom.

On some SjiecUd Evils of the Scottish Poor Laiv. By Alex. M'Neel Caied.

The author, after referring to the position of the poor people before the dis-

ruption, and the fact that in some measure it led to the passing of the Poor Law

Act of 1845, said that in Scotland the parish minister and live of his elders were

entitled to hfe-seats at the Parochial Board for managing the poor, whUe in fewer

than one in seven of the whole parishes an equal number of members were per-

mitted to be elected by the ratepayers. There were 32G parishes out of 811 in

which the elected members were restricted by the Board of Supervision to a third

of those entitled to seats by reason of ecclesiastical office. There were not a few

parishes in which only one member was permitted to be elected. Thus a perilous

system had grown up of men who contributed little, having the power of spending

the money of ratepayers, who had no "\oice in their appointment and no power to

remove them. The constant \igilance necessary to keep pauperism within bounds

was not liliely to find a place under such a system. Then the advance of expen-

diture for the poor in Scotland was found in 1847 to be £4.33,915, and in 1S75

£7U4,916. Li England, in 1847, the expenditure was £5,298,787, and in 1874, the

latest report, it was £7,(304,957 ; while in Ireland, in 1852 (the earliest report he

could get), the sum expended was £884,200, while in 1875 it was only £771,553.

In Ireland there had been a reduction instead of a growth in the total cost, even

including able-bodied, whei'o the population was only five and a half niilUons

whereas in Scotland the popidation was only three millions, and the able-bodied

had no claim on the rates. That was explained by the knowai excess to whicli out-

door rehef was carried on in Scotland luider ecclesiastical managers. Of 176,787

receiving relief in 1874, only 7752 were in the poorhouse ; while in England onl}'

one in five of the poor were put on indoor relief, and in Ireland foity-four were iu

the workhouse for every thirty who got outdoor relief. The independence which

formerly characterized the Scottish peasantry had been undermined and destroyed

through the facility with which outdoor relief had been gi\en. An illustratioii of

-- --the lax management was to be fomid in the extent to which loose women of the

parish immarried women with children recei\ed stipend:! from the poor-rates,

enabhng them to live manifestly to their neighbours iu greater ease than others of

their rank. In the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright there were found on the roUs eighty-

seven dissolute women having 207 children, of whom only three women ha\iiig

eight children were sent to the poorhouse. One parish in that county stood among

the highest in Europe for bastard}'. In January 1875 there were in the southern

district of Scotland alone 741 women with 1473 illegitimate children receiving

parish rehef; and in another di.-trict, in May 1875, there were on the outdoor roll
330 cases of single women with illegitimate children. Coidd it bo wondered, there-

--fore, that mider such a system, patronized by the Church and its ministers unde-
--signedly no doubt, but very ellt'ctually the growth of immorality in Scotland

should have become so appalling. Tid anybody beHe-\ e that if the management

were substantially in the hands of Christian men, elected by those who provided

the funds, that such a system could live for three months '^

Another evil Avas the area for lating and settlement. That in Scotland was

limited to parishes: in England there were only 047 of such areas, while in Scot-

land there were 804. In Ivigland tlie papulation to each area wa-i '5,972. while in

1876.                                                         18
--198 REPORT 1876.

Scotland it was only 4280 ; and London, with a population equal to Scotland, had
only thirty. Nearly one in three of these areas in Scotland had fewer than 1000
inh'ahitants, and every tenth parish fewer than 500. That caused a great inequcality
of rating between neighbovuing parishes, and a multitude of petty administrations
with limited views and increased expenses, and continual interparochial conflicts.
As an instance of that, he mentioned that in the Barony parish of Glasgow alone
there were commonly between 2000 and 3000 undetermined cases of settlement.
Again, the law of settlement was adAerse to freedom of liberty, and the effect of it

was that a man whose settlement was in a small parish was practicahy limited to

the inhabitants of that parish to find customers for his labour. It operated by
creating a fictitious interest, in every land- or house-owner, farmer, and ratepayer
feeling it their duty to prevent a man' being in their parish long enough to obtain a

settlement there. The field for a labouruig man was therefore physically limited to

narrow bounds roimd the place where he lived, and any arrangement which artifi-
cially increased his difficidty in obtaining a house in another district, where he covdd
have steadier work and better wages, was a source of oppression to him. The law
of settlement in narrow areas had led to the pulling down of houses and restriction
of the accommodation of labourers in county parishes in Scotland, and one result
of that was that nearly one third of the whole people of Scotland lived in houses of
one room. That was' a fact which required to be enforced on the Legislature, in
order that -wider bounds of settlement might be adopted, as had been done elcA en

years ago in England.

                      invested in Trade. By Hyde Clarke, F.S.S.

     The author stated that it was popularly considered that capital in its excess or in

its  deficiency  was  uniform  in  its  influence  in  all  branches  of  commerce                                                    and  he

called attention to branches of trades wherein the amount of capital indicated could

Anot practicaUy be increased.           ready-money tradesman, as a baker, might be

quoted as an examjile ; and the total of such operations was large. Li England,

France, and Germany there were a number of persons engaged in such trades, the

savings of which in times of prosperity went to form a fund for the larger opera-

tion,? of commerce, and the distiu'bance of which aggravated the severity of a period

of pressure.

  On recent attempts at Patent Ler/islation. By St. John V. Day, C.E. ^r.

   The author holds that the Lord Chancellor's Bill of 187G is entirely contrary to

what is wanted for the maintenance of an eflicient Patent Law ; he points out the

insufiiciency of the numbers of examiners for which the Bill provides. Examina-
tion can be and ought to be effectually carried out.

   The paper contains statistics for the requirements and practice advocated,
shows on what grounds it is desirable to maintain the existing practice of granting
provisional protection upon the filing of a provisional specification ; the practice of
preparing abridgements is unnecessarj^, and series no practical end, as in all cases

it is essential to refer to the complete specifications themselves.

   The author also discusses the clause of the Bill dealing with what the examiners

are to report upon, compidsory licenses, &c.

On (he Importance of extending the British Gold Standard., with subordinate

    Silver Coins, to India as a remedy for the inconvenience in India of a rapid

   Depreciation of Silver. By W. N'eilson Hancock, LL.D.

   It was obvious to those who had read the report of the Committee on the Depre-

ciation of Silver that the British currency occupied an exceptionally satisfactory
position for meeting the great fluctuation in value which silver was undergoing.
In India, under the government of the East- India Company, the primitive arrange-

                                                                                                                                               i

mcnt of a silver standard was allowed to remain ; and this unsatisfactory state of

matters continued till 1837, when, although a new rupee was established, the use

of silver as a standard was left unchanged. The residt has been that the depre-

ciation of silver has produced a most serious disturbance in the exchanges between

this coiuitry and India, and has disturbed trade and monetary transactions in India

gcner.illy. One of the causes of disturbance was the discovery of the fertile silver-

mines in California                                                                                        and  he regretted  to say that there was no guarantee against  a
                                                                                                        ;

further and stiU more disturbing faU in the value of silver, like what took place in

the sixteenth century after the disco-\ery of the silver-mines of Potosi. Had the

assimilation of the Indian and British currencies taken place in 1810 or 1833 no

difficidty would have arisen any more than it had done in Canada or Australia. He

did not think that the change of the standard from silver to gold would involve any

change in the mode of keeping accoimts in rupees. All that was required was to

fix the proportion at which a sovereign would be a legal tender. As to the desira-

bility of such a change he thought there could be no doubt ; and had the change

been made when the value of the rupee was two shillings it would have been easy,

as a sovereign would then have been exactly ten rupees. To remedy the evil, the

author concluded by expressing a desire that a reformation of the coinage and an

assimilation of the currency betAveen this country and India should take place

during the reign of Her Majesty, as in that way the sovereignty of the Queen

would, in the circulation of British rupees and British sovereigns, marked with their

fixed proportion of rupees, be associated in the mind of every native of India with

the lasting benefit conferred on himself and his countrj'.

On Savings' Banls as a State Function develoijed hy Clvcmty Organization.

                         By W. Neilson Hancock, LL.D.

 --The results submitted to the Section were ; That now the perfectly safe places

mfor the savings of the poor are provided by the State such numbers, and for such

long Lours, and under such convenient arrangements by the Post-Oilice Savings'

Banks, the object for which charitable Savings' Banks were established has been

fulfilled, and these institutions have become imnecessary and are a waste of cha-

ritable effect.

    That the State shoidd withdraw its connexion with them, as the State has only

imperfect and divided control, as the limitation of liability of the charitable pro-
moters makes the security imperfect, and as it is bad teaching for the poor to offer
them a bounty at the public expense to invest their savings in less perfect secmity

than the Post-Oflice Savings' Banks.

   That the vohmtary closing of charitable Savings' ]3anks is going on too slowly,
owing to the too limited provision for the compensation of the paid officers.

   That the State woidd save £140,000 a year immediately, and as the paid officers

died or retired would save £280,000 if the system of official audit in Ireland were
extended to England and Scotland, and aU the Trustee Banks and officers, as soon
as the audit was completed, were taken over by the State.

   That tlie ser-\ices of the charitable promoters and honorary officers in instituting

the general system of Sa-\ings' Banks for the poor, which the State has been so long
connected with, and the great profit to the State of immediate and complete con-

version of charitable SaAings' Banks into Post-Oflice Sa-\ings' Banks, makes it a case

where complete security of serAice or compensation to the officers would not only

be  morally     u.st,  but                                                                                 economically  advantageous  to  the  State.

 200 REPORT--187G.

                   Hie Results of Five Years of Compuhonj Education.

                                  By "William Jack, LL.D.

    In this paper the author did not propose to discuss the question whether the quality
 of elementaiy education in this country has improved or deteriorated in conse-

 quence of the introduction of conipidsion. Few inquiries would be more difficult.
 There is no absolute standard of quality. He used the word results for two things

 which can be measiu'ed in figures :
    (1) The change in the number of children attending efficient elementary schools.
    (2) The change, if any, in the regularity of attendance at school.
    In the EngHsh Education Act of 1870 the Government, for the first time, sanc-

 tioned the principle that wherever the school boai'd of a locality believes that chil-

dren ought to be compelled to attend school, parents may be compelled to send them

under penalty of fine or imprisonment, subject to such bye-laws as the school board

may enact.

    Since that time school boards representing a population of nearly 12^ millions of

people in England and Wales have passed and worked compidsory bye-laws. Com-
pulsion is now adopted by forty-six per cent, of the whole popidation of England
 and Wales, and by eighty-two per cent, of the borough population.

   In the new Education Act of 1876 England has adopted the principle of imi-

versal compulsion, creating a school attendance committee where there is no school
board, and enjoining that committee or the school board of the locality to make and
enforce bye-laws and otherwise carry out the pro^ isions of the Act.

    They are briefly these :
    1st. It is declared to be the duty of eveiy parent to see to the elementary educa-
tion of his child above five and below fourteen.

   2nd. No employer is permitted to employ

                (a) any child imder ten years of age, with certain (no doubt considerable)
                        permitted exceptions ; or

               (V) any child o^er ten and up to fourteen
without a certificate either of education or of previous attendance of a due amoiuit.

    These provisions will come into force fully in 1881.

    After giving the general results for the three countries the wi'iter proposed to look
.somewhat more in detail to the results of the application of compulsion in the large

cities, which are tyi^es of 82 per cent, of the borough population of England. The
Act of 1870 decreed a school board for London. The first step which llie board
took was to discover the actual school supplj' in the metropolis, and to malve a rea-
sonable estimate of what was wanted. The CT0\ernment theory was, that accomo-
dation ought to be provided for one in six of the population. After malring allow-
ances for the middle and \ipper classes, and for the necessary absences, the School
Board of Londim decided that a supply for one in eight of the population was enough
to provide for (lc7nentayy schooling in its district. Accordingly it was necessaiy to
have accommodation for 420,000 children, the population in 1871 being approximately
.3,.350,000. The Board found schools existing in 1870, or erected or projected be-
tween that and 1873, for 308,000, so that their first duty was to biuld for 112,000
more children. Many of the existing schools were inefficient ; they had to work
gradually towards the remodelling or uprooting of these inefficient schools; they
had to alter the habit of irregular attendance. Between the spring of 1871 and the
Michaelmas of 1873, two and a half years, they had increased the average attend-
ance by 60,000. At midsummer, 1876, the average attendance had risen to 30.5,749,
an iuci'ease of 131,448 over the spring of 1871, when it was 174,301. Thus in five
years the average attendance on efficient schools has risen by sevent,y-fi-\e per cent.

m the metropolis, against tlie Irish eight per cent, in five years. Besides this there

were 42,C00 in non-efficient schools, which is 12,000 fewer than in the previous

year. There were 87,000 who ought to have been at school, but who were absent
from various causes at Midsummer 1876. This official estimate of deficiency is

fomided on the theoiy that 575,000 children between three and thirteen require ele-

--mentary teaching say one in six of the population. But the School Board of Lon-

don do not think it necessary to provide school accommodation for more than 440,000

-- say one in eiglit : and in fact they have pro^ided, up to llie end of 1876, for

                                                                                                 <
                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                  201

420,000, which was their original estimate of existing deficiency. They have only

to provide efficient schools for the children representing the increase of population

since 1871.

The change wrought since the foundation of the School-Board system is thus

enormous. Considering the number of untrained children drawn for the first time

within the School-Board net the regularity of attendance secured is also very re-

markable. It was 7h ])er cent, of the roU iu Midsummer, 74^ per cent, at Christmas,
--1875, 7G^ per cent, at Midsummer, 1876
                                          rather  better  than  that  in  Scotland                                     and
                                                                                                                    ;

these residts are to be compared with the 67 per cent, of Ireland, where there is no

compidsion, and of all England, where it is only partial.
   Of the 87,000 not attending school in the metropolis I must add that G.'},000 are

luider ti-\-e, an age when we in Scotland scarcely think of sending children to school
at all. The infant-school system is, it is well knoAvn, much more developed in south

than iu north Britain.

   For the sake of simplicity I lla^·e neglected the varying increases of population
in the large towns. To take it into account would introduce no material change in

the comparative figures, and veiy little change of any kind.
   It remains for us to look at the diirJc side of compulsion. In London two pre-

limmaiy notices precede the parent's simimons before a magistrate for neglect of

his children. These warnings generally have the efiect desired. Thus there were

A35,000 notices iu last half-year, which brought l.'ijOOO to school, or made them

more regular ; then there were 23,000 B notices ; these were followed by 3990 sum-

monses and by about 3400 fines. At that time in London 150 people were sum-

moned and 130 people were fined every week for neglecting the education of their
children. The cost of this machinery for the year is £24,000, being Is. 7cl. per head

per annum on the average attendance secm-ed. But the cost, hea\y though it is,
seems to me scarcely worth coimting compared with the feehng amongst the poor

which I should expect these prosecutions to create. There is no sign, however, that
the efficiency of the present compidsory action is diminishing. The addition to the
attendance in the half-year ending Midsummer, 1875, was 17,600. In the half-year
ending Christmas, 1875, it was only 1400. But the winter was an exceptionally se-
vere one, and the increase in the haK-j^ear ending Midsummer, 1876, has again risen

and it may help to realize the difficulty as well as the extent of the problem practi-

cally pre>ented to school-board officers if I take four instances at random from the

repoi t of the London School Board. They seem to me to throw a vivid light on

the infinite variety of domestic and social entanglements in which the enforcement

of compidsion inevitably involves us.

   " Richard Iluf t was summoned for Richard, nine. The lad is a very bad one,
and was rapidly going to ruin. The father haviiig arranged with some friends in
the country to take charge of him in the future, the summons was withdrawn' upon

payment of costs."
    " Tomlin. In this case, notwithstanding that fines were imposed, and a warrant

appHed for and granted for the apprehension of the defendant, no good result en-

.sued, as the warrant officer was unable to apprehend the father, who worked in the
countiy, and seldom or never returned home except on Sundays. Application was
made to the magistrate for a summons against the wife, on the ground that she had

the ' actual custody.' This was granted ; but she removed, and the ·\ isitor has been
unable to ascertain her address. She probably went into the country."

   "Richard Ravmond was summoned at Lambeth police-court for neglecting to
cause his son ^^ illiam to attend school. The father stated that the boy had been

refused admission on account of an impediment iu his .speech. In order that in-

quiries might be made Mr. EUison adjourned the case for one week, when the state-
ment of the father being proved false a fine of 2s. and costs was inflicted."

   " Henry Warner, summoned for his son, aged ten, pleaded that it was no fault of
his, that his wife was master of the situation, and woidd not let the lad attend
school. Case was adjourned for inqmiy, which resulted in establishing the fact that

the defendant was certainly not the master of his household ; but the magistrat»

«aid he ought to be, and fined him."
203 REPORT--1876.

  A family like Rust's shifts its residence out of London. The case drops out of

the cognizance of those who ha-ve long been watching it, and new officers have to take
it up from the very beginning. Tomlin's father is never at home except on Sim-
days and when the school board officer summons the mother, who has " the actual

                       ;

custody," JNIrs. Tomhn slips through his fingers like an eel. Raymond's father pre-
tends that he has an impediment, and that schools won't take liim in. Poor War-
ner has a wife who won't let the lad attend school, and won't let Warner send him
there. There are forty cases for every one of these eveiy week ; two thousand
times as many of such stories are told annually before the police-courts of London,

every one of them with some ingenious variation of pretended excuse, or some

miserable and perplexing real difficulty.

  --The statistics of Liverpool are as follow : The cost of compulsion is about 2s. per

child on the roll (about 'ds. per child in average attendance), which is about twice
what it is in London. The increase in the average attendance on public elementary
schools in five years is from 3.3,827 to 41,192, being 21 per cent., as against the 8
per cent, of Ireland or the 75 per cent, of London. The average attendance has
fallen from 70 per cent, to 64 per cent, of the number on the roll, which is very sig-
nificant of the class of children brought in by the compidsory clauses. Besides the
public schools the authorities of Liverpool estimate that there were 10,058 on the
roll of all other elementary schools in 1871, and 14,.300 of aU others iir 1875. Liver-

pool has advanced, but very much more slowly than London. It started very
much better than London did, and had far less leeway to make up. It is difficult

precisely to compare its present educational position with that of London, because

the non-public schools occupy much more of the ground in proportion than in the
metropolis. Its population was 493,000 in 1871, and there were 14,000 seamen be-
longing to the port. So far as school attendance goes there is probably little now
to choose between the two cities.

    In Liverpool great attention is paid to the working of compulsory bye-laws. In
the year ending October 1, 1870, 6182 notices were issued to parents, and 1817 pro-
secutions took place in consequence. This woidd correspond to about 12,000 in Lon-

don, the rate there being 8000. Before the parent is prosecuted parents are brought

by the notices to meet a member of the board and the superintendent of visitors,
and such meetings are held two or three times a week. For instance, the author is

told, " In one small district, having about 2000 children, the parents of 355 were

brought before a member of the board, and the present result is that 124 are regu-

lars, 11 are delicate, 10 ha^e removed, 6 are over age, 1 has been exempt, and there

are 203 who are still irregular ; 24 of these have been summoned more than once.
Those from the 203 who are still irregidar who have not been summoned are not

 considered irregular enough for a summons."
    The statistics of Manchester are somewhat similar to those of Liverpool. The

 Manchester attendance returns were first collected by the board in December, 1871.
At that date the average attendance was 26,328, and the number on the roll was
39,240. The last quarterly returns for the quarter ending .lune, 1876, showed
 32,220 children in average and 50,461 in roll attendance. Thus in 4^ years the
average attendance has risen 22^ per cent., or 5 per cent, per annum. The popula-
 tion of Manchester has remained practically stationary during the time, so that the
 same extent of increase was not to be expected as in the case, for instance, of Glas-

gow and of London. But the general effect on the results of making the allowance

 would nowhere be of very great importance.

    The regularity of attendance may be measured as usual by the proportion which
 the average bears to the roll attendance. It was 67 per cent, in Manchester before
 compidsion, it is now 64 per cent. ; and the change signifies that a new class, whose

 attendance it is unusually difficult to secure or to njake regular, has been brought

into school. Attendance in Manchester has not fallen much under the pressm'e of
the compidsoiy law ; but it was not higher before, and it is a Httle lower now than

 the average for all England and for Ireland.
    The compulsory powers of the School Board are extensively used in Manchester.

 The clerk of the Board tells me that the recent average is seventy or eighty cases

 brought before the magistrate per week. The pressure is exercised on two grounds

--non-attendance and irregular attendance ; and the board at present aims to con-
                       --

strain children to give at least 80 per cent, of possible attendances. The population

-- --of Manchester is 351,000, so that seventy per week say 3o00 per year represents

one prosecution for every hundred persons. But this rate is only the existing or re-
cent rate. In the whole of 1875 there were only 1039 prosecutions--say 20 per
week, or 1 in 340 of the population. The author supposes that the increased acti^ity
of prosecution is largely due to the rise in the increased number of attendances,
from 50 to 80 per cent., required under recent bye-laws, in the last week of which
he was told the prosecutions anioiuited to as many as 130, which is pretty much the
same as for the ten times more populous city of London. lie does not know the
expense of school-board prosecutions in Manchester. Both in that city and in
Liverpool the attendance seems to have become slightly less regidar under compul-

sion.

   In Birmingham the results are veiy remarkable. The city was the head-quarters
of the Education League, and that powerful and intelligent organization influenced
the School Board. Noblesse ohlige. The first Birmingham board felt itself bound
to show what educational zeal could do. In December 1871 the a\erage attend-
ance in pubhc elementary schools w'as 16,263. Compidsion was not resorted to till

May 1872. Then and since then the average has been :

December 1871          16,263
                       20,028
May     1872           28,035
                       30,339
,, 1873                34,718
,, 1874                38,817
,, 1875
w 1876

   Thus in 4^ years the apparent increase in Birmingham has been 138 per cent.
"When account is taken of half-timers, according to the modes of computation of the

department, the increase in these 4^ years is the prodigious one of 150 per cent. In
additi<in to tliis the proportion of average attendance to the roU attendance has risen

from (j'2 to 70 per cent. Tliese magnificent residts make the record of the first two
school boards of Birmingham memorable in the educational annals of England.
They have not been obtained, howe-\er, without great exertions and severe pressure.

Since May 1872 prosecution has been resorted to in 7515 cases, an average of 1000
aranially. At that rate the annual average for London with its 306,000 of atten-

dance should be 17,000 instead of 8000. Birmingham manages compidsion cheaply.

Prosecutions used to cost them £1000 anmiaUy ; they now cost, under a system of
specially reduced fees, only £300. But the chief expense of compulsion in Loudon,

and probably everywhere, is due to the staff of visitors. The mere legal expenses
of compulsion in London were imder £-300 in the half-year ending Midsmnmer, 1876.

   The compidsory action taken in London, Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool
is very stringent. Li London there is one prosecution annually for e'sery 450 of the
popvdation ; in Birmingham about one for every 200 ; in Manchester about one for
every 100 at present, and about one for every 340 in 1 875. To the author it appears
doubtful whether the poorer classes wiU long endure such a pressure with patience.
As the con^·iction of the necessity of school attendance and the habit of obedience to
the law deepens in the masses of the people we may hope, doubtless, that the same
results, or others e\en more satisfactory, may be obtained at a far lower cost of legal
process, with all tlie hardships and harassments which it involves. But it is dilh-
cult to believe that so much pressure is necessary.

   In these respects the procedure and experience of Glasgow are in remarkable con
trast vdih that of England. The authorities started two years later than in Eng-
land ; and as new schools have often to be built before children can be driven to
school, the first years of compidsory action are always the least effective. The re-

sults are these. In inspected schools, and not mspected efficient schools charging the

same as board schools, there were

30,103 in average attendance in 187;5

36,568         ,,  ,,  1874

42,075         ,,  ,,  1875
204 REPORT--1876.

The rise in two years lias tluis been 12,572, or 42 per cent., a rate almost as remark-

able as that of Birmingham. The percentage of a-^erage attendance to roll attend-

ance amounts to

                                79 per cent, in 1873

                                7G ,,          ,, 1874
                                78 ,,          ,, 1875

which is still more remarkable. The latest results (October 9) are that Glasgow

has managed to raise her average attendance to 84 per cent, of the numbers on the

roll. Some not inspected efficient schools are included in these estimates ; but they

are a small fraction of the whole, and their exclusion would not materially alter the

proportions of increase. They account for about .3000 children. Settmg them

aside, indeed, we shoidd ha-\e an increase of 50 per cent, in the two years in the in-

spected schools, which is nearly quite equal to that of Birmingham.

    The remarkable pait of the case of Glasgow is the manner in which the compul-

sory clauses have been worked. The Glasgow secret is very simple. The board

goes down among the defaulting parents, holding frequent meetings in their ovsni
locaHties, to hear the stories of the poor and to persuade them for their own and

their children's good. They try every thing before they prosecute. They distribute

ily-lea^es copiously, narrating the facts, so as to make every actual prosecution go

as far as possible in persuading other people. Gentleness woidd be useless without

iirmness, and the Glasgow board has not worn its sword of justice altogether in

vain ; but it has shrunk from prosecutions with an energy and a success which, now
that compidsion is to be uni^·ersal, it is hoped we may see widely imitated. In some
riu'al districts, and perhaps with sensible women for compulsory ofhcers, prosecutions

ought to be almost unnecessary. The fact that the law is in the background ought

tliere, at least, to be generally sufficient.

    The name of the con^ ener of the Glasgow School-Board School Attendance Com-

mittee win long be lield in honour for a work imique in its character and in its suc-

cessful residt. In the three years of his reign the School Attendance Committee

--has dealt with 20,515, less by removals 2819, and exemptions 1684 say 10,000 de-

faidting parents. Of these, 8000 sent children to school after a remonstrance and

personal warning by N'isit of the officers ; 5800 more went to school after notice

sent to them warning them of the possibility of prosecution following that notice.

The members of the school board themselves met with the defaulting parents on

eighteen separate occasions, and 1400 children of the balance of nearly 2200 were

sent to school in consequence. Only 51 have been pi-oseoitcd durin;/ the three years

of the action of the Board. E^ery thing is done to avoid prosecutions ; it is only
when every thing else fails that they are resorted to. The ratepayers' money is

saved, the goodwill and the consciences of the people are enUsted in education, the

work of future boards is made infinitely easier, and attendance more regular than

elsewhere has been secured. No part of the labour of the Glasgow board has been

more profitable than the eighteen meetings held witli defaulting parents, in different

parts of the city where the people live, between February 1874 and January 1876.

There were 18-34 parents summoned to meet the board, representing 2269 children.

All but 250 of the parents answered. The board divided itself into fragments, each

sitting separately, and in the whole of a long day getting through about one htm-

dred cases each. Mr. Mitchell has shown how to meet the greatest difficulty of the

compulsory system. His is a Idndly and patriarchal government. Parents are, so

far, reasonable creatures, and an ounce iif gentle but firm persuasion seems to go as

far with most of them as a pound of punishment. Even if, on a review of the whole

circumstances, it might seem desirable, it might in some cases be difficidt to go back

on  the  decided  steps wliich  have  been     taken                              and  these  steps, it  must  be remem-
                                                                               ;

bered, have been fairly effectual. In London and Birmingham the residts obtained

are undoubtedly satisfactory, and in Liverpool and Manchester they are consider-

able. The author does not pretend for a moment to criticise the action of men to

whose admirable labours this coimtry and these great communities are deeply in-

debted. He has no wish to make out percentages of credit for the different com-

munities and school boards. If he did he should certainly ha-\e to take account of

an infinitude of circumstances which he has neglected here. He is deahng only

with actual residts. But nobcdy will doubt that persuasion, with punishment in

is con.siderab]e, but it is less than that incurred by more stringent action. The pro-
cess has so far been equally eii'ectual, and it cannot fail to leave the poorer classes
in favour of, whereas the otlier mode of action may, one fears, leave tliem hostile to,

education. The author in conclusion said :

   Tliere are few presentations of statistics to which some objection may net be

taken, and the educational statistics of the large towns under school boards, and of
the country so far as it is under the official cognizance of the Privy Council, can
form no exception. Some private adventure schools for the classes that need ele-

mentary education still survive, and a few of them may be efficient. It would
scarcely affect my figures, the main value of which is comparative, if I attempted

to estimate these" additional elements in the problem on the inadequate data which
are alone accessible. If we confine ourselves to the broad general conclusions whicli

lie on the surface of the figures I have given, I think we cannot go very far wrong.

I throw together the results for the five cities :

statutory offences according to an arbitrary definition. They create and, as it

were, authorize a recogiiized minimum of attendance. The Birmingham board have

no minimiun named, and are therefore much in the same position as the Glasgow

board. Their bye-laws require perfectly regular attendance, and they enforce them

at their discretion. Perhaps the Glasgow board and the other Scotch boards could

not if they had wished have prosecuted as frequently as their neighbours in England.

Mr. INEtchell thinks so, and believes that a very great deal of the greater leniency

and the smaller amount of prosecution in Scotland is due to the more lenient spirit

of the framers of the Scotch act. lie is most probably right ; and one of the main

points to which I hope that this discussion may dii-ect the attention of school boards

is the policy or impoUcy of Aery numerous and stringent bye-laws. But I must

again disclaim any wish to assign credit to individual boards, or to seem to sit in

judgment on their conduct.

myI think that  figures conclusively pro^e that the best results, both in increased

quantity and regularity of attendance, are not necessarily connected vnih. the

strictest working of the compulsory law. Manchester, which seems at present to be

strictest, and Liverpool, which is third on the list, are lowest in both respects. Bir-

mingham, -which is second in strictness, is highest in increased quantity as well as

in actual amomit of education, and third in respect of regidarity of attendance, which

has risen there in a remarkable degree. London, which seems most lenient of the

four great English cities, has increased education much more rapidly than Manches-

ter or Liverpool, though it seems to have now reached very much the same level in

respect of quantity. It has a more regidar attendance than either of these cities or

than Birmingham. Glasgow, wliich in respect of compidsory action by legal process

is almost ludicrously lenient in comparison with the other cities, stands hig-hest in

respect of the regidarity of attendance obtained, and second in respect of the in-

creased quantity of education. Of course neither Glasgow nor any other board can

reap where it has not sowed, and the paucity of legal processes is no sign that the

Glasgow board did not spend an indefinite amount of labour in securing the residts

it has obtained. I am spealdng only of the last resort to the pains and penalties of

law, and I thinli 1 can scarcely be mistaken in saying that my figures almost disprove

the theory that the tighter the screw is pressed down in the way of actual punish-

ment the more effective must the pressure become.

  --I do not care to press the inferences that the facts I ha^'e collated seem to me to

establish any further than these conclusions :

1. That the need of the comitry for compidsory education was a cryuig need in

1870.

2. That the success of the experiment which has now been tried in Scotland and

in nearly half of England justifies the modest advances that have been made by the

gOAcrmnent in the bill of the present year.

o. That compidsion has been carried out in one great city with perfect efficiency,

and with a very trifiing amount of legal process.

4. That no connexion between stringent Icf/al compidsory action and great educa-

tional residt is indicated by the figures. It is almost needless to say that I do not

suppose that a school board can safely leave the matter to take care of itself.

       The Valuation of Propertij in Ireland. By Heney jEPnsoN.

An increasing desire has latterly been CAdnced for the assimilation of the laws of

England and Ireland. Amongst those which shoidd be assimilated are the laws on

the valuation of property. In England and Scotland the valuation is based upon

the rent, in Ireland it is based on the prices of agricidtural produce. Very strong

reasons can be adduced for the revaluation of Ireland. Tlie present valuation has

practically not been revised since it was made, about twenty-five years ago ; the

value of property has, however, changed considerably, and great inequalities exist

Aas to the incidence of taxation.  revaluation being therefore necessary, it is

recommended that the English and Scotch system be adopted, for not alone is that

system more correct, but by adopting it the principle of valuation of property would

be made similar throughout the United Kingdom. By acting on this recommenda-

tion we should remove the inequaUties in tlie incidence of local taxation ; we should
also remove the necessity for a large amount of separate legislation for Ireland,
wiiich is entailed by a different valuation, and we should make another and a great
stride towards an object, on many grounds most eminently desirable, namely, the
assimilation of the laws of the two countries.

           On the Depreciation of Silver and a Gold Standard for India.
                                    By Stephen Mason.

   The author proposed, as a simple and effectual remedy, the altering of the standard
of value from siher to gold. The substitution of the one standard for the other might

--be carried into effect by the following method : Let the Indian go^"ernment adopt

a gold standard as a measm-e of value as soon as practicable, and without delay iix

a date when aU transactions shall be paid or settled upon a sterling basis for all sums

exceeding ten rupees. This plan did not in^·olve the necessity of altering the cur-

--rency of India a ^ery delicate and difficult operation, as Clermany has found to

her cost. The substitution of a gold for a silver currency in India woidd reqmre at
least £100,000,000 of gold, and entail a loss upon the Indian go^ ernment of not less
than £20,000,000 sterling, possibly much more, besides dislocating the whole money
markets of tlie world, and in all probability lead to a great financial crisis in this
country. This policy shoidd at once be dismissed as impolitic and imwdse.

                   On the Silver Dilemma. By J. Matheson, Junr.

 --The well-ascertained facts affecting the question were : 1st, that the price of bar

silver, which for many years previous to 1873 had been sustained with little fluctu-

ation, the average being almost 60^d. per oz., had since that period steadily dechned

(the drop as regarded the present year especially being imequalled), viz. from 56d.

in January to 47f/. in Jidy ; 2nd, that the downward movement was influenced by

a variety of causes, of which the principal were the increased production of silver,

and  the  falling  off  or a blank  in  some sources of  demand                                          and 3rd, that  the extra
                                                                                                      ;

yield was entirely accounted for by the increase of the production of the American

silver-mines from £o,7oO,000 in 1874 to £7,400,000 in 1875, with the prospect of a

further increase in the present year.

   With respect to the various schemes put forth for a reform of the Indian currency

he described as errors the idea of supposing that the value of the rupee coidd be
raised by legislative measures otherwise than locally, temporarily, and with gross in-

justice towards one section of the commmiity, or that a double standard might be

adjusted and sustained with impunity, or that the mercantile public of India coidd

be forced to import gold for the currency purposes of the country, vvithout being

the victims of a one-sided policj'. If a gold currency were desirable for India the
government alone, following the example of Germany, might fittingly provide it.

   The general conclusion was that there was nothing in the existing crisis to war-

rant the demonetization of silver ; and further, that the principal silver-valuing

coimtries, even if they desired to do so, were not pos.sessed of such wealth as might
render the attempt practicable. The question was essentially fraught with imcer-

tainty. He coidd not but think, however, that the more thoroughly we grasped it

   On the Educational Vcdue of their Native Language to the Qaelic-sjiealdng
                     Population of Scotland. By Rev. W. Ross.

   The author stated that his experience, which was fortified by that of the govern-
ment inspectors, of Sheriff Cleghorn, Sheriff Nicholson, Bishop Eden, and others,
was that the effect of banishing the use of Gaelic from the classes in English or
Highland schools was that children were taught to read EngUsh fluently enough
without understanding the meaning of what they read. During the past ten years
he had examined ten thousand Highland children, and he was con^ inced that satis-
factory educational results were to b? obtained only by pursuing a different method
from that of excluding Gaelic translation which had hitherto been followed. To
ignore or exclude the native language from the school was to prolong the use of the
Gaelic language (a prolongation against which he did not personally object), and to
do so at the expense of intelligence, education, and cidture. The only way to obtain
an intelligent acquaintance with English in a large section of the country was to

                       Sheriff Courts and Relative Judicial Statistics.

                   By P. EdssELL, Sheriff- Substitute of lloxhurgh.

    The author gave an historical sketch of the Sheriff Courts, which took their pre-
 sent form after the rebellion of 1745. At present tlie Sheriffs appointed their own
 substitutes, and the aggi-egate salaries of these judges were nearly £40,000 per
 annum. The jurisdiction of the courts extended to all criminal offences except the
 four jjleas of the Cro\vn ; and during the last three years the number of people
 tried in the Court of Justiciary annually was 507, and in Sheriff Courts 2012, be-
 sides what were known as summary trials. After the establishment of the Court
 of Session in 15-32, the jurisdiction of the Sheriffs in ci^U matters was limited,
 though still extensive. The average amiual number of final judgments during the

--five years from 1870 to 1874 in the Court of Session was 1280 ; and in the Sheriff

 Courts during the same period were ordinary court 547<^ debts recovery ctnirt
 2559, and small debt court 38,458. The appeals to Sheriffs during the last three
 years had averaged 527, of which 341 were sustained, 180 received, and 106 mixed.

        The Civilization of South- Eastern Africa. By J.vmes Stephekson.

        On the Theory and Practice of Accident Insurance by Sea and Land.
                                        By P. M. Tait.

     Commencing by about thirty definitions of the word "accident"' according to

  various authorities (very usefid information for insurance companies), the paper
  treats separately in great detail of ocean accidents, railway accidents, and general

  accidents.

     As to ocean accidents one curious fact was brought out, that these vary
  with the age of the captains commanding the vessels, there being apparently a
 certain epoch in the life of a master mariner when danger of disaster is reduced
  to a minimum. Other things being equal, passengers are safer to sail under a cap-
                                                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS,                                           209

tain cif about 50 than under one of an earlier or more advanced age. Tlie entire
premium to cover increased risk of master mariners is from 80s. to 40«. per cent, per
annum ; that is to saj', if a clergj'man or barrister can obtain insurance on his life
for £100 at a premium of £4, the premium required to insure a master mariner of
tlie same age woidd be from £5 10s. to £6. This is the ratio all roimd, but captains
of Cunard's and other first-rate lines -would of course be insured for less.

   As to railway accidents the facts were not brought up to the latest dates. But

it comes out very clearly that the lisk to railway officials actually employed on the
line is excessive. Nearly all railway accidents are remediable, and the chance of

disaster coidd be still vastly reduced by a universal adoption of the block and

interlocking system-, the use of perfect brakes, and other improvements long ago

suggested.

   The mortality from accidents generally is a very important and interesting de-
partment of vital statistics. The number of accidents occurring in England and
Wales is reproduced from year to year with extraordinary regidarity, indicating the

operation of a fixed law. Excessive di\ision of labour has a tendency to increase

accidents by the introduction of new machinery, at first often imperfectly under-
stood. The introduction of rinks and bicycles has led to a wholly new class of

accidents requiring special medical treatment.

   Insurance offices charge the same premiums against an m:forseen casualty from
the ages 15 to GO. But from -\ery recent data wholly reliable it was very clearly
shown in the paper that the mortality from accidents increases gi'eatly at the
more advanced ages, and that consequently some difference shoidd be made in the
premiums applicable to those ages. It is not that there are a greater number of
accidents at tliose ages, but that there is less power of rallying from the effects of
an accident.

   The paper concludes with specimen policies of the different companies, sliowuig
the ri-ik covered and the general conditions of the accident insurance contract.

On tJie Boarding-out of Pauper Children in England. By Wm. Tfliack.

The author said that the system had been adopted for five years in England, but

in consequence of want of information, and an unfounded confusion in tlie public

mind of the system with the obnoxious and wholesale farming out of children with

which so many evils and cruelties were associated, it had not made the progress

which miglit have been anticipated. He wannly advocated the system, more espe-

cially for girls. In contrasting it with the workhouse plan, he drew a vivid picture

of tlie evils attending the association of children with adult paupers who were

often vicious, and with other children, many of whom had been swept from the

streets. In the system of district schools he recognized a great improvement, but

he did not think it was equal, especially in the case of girls, to a system of boarding

them out singly in carefidly supervised cottage homes. But the district school

Asystem was also objectionable on the score of cost.  sort of institution mania had

taken possession of many minds. It seemed to be assumed that both adidts and

children shoidd be gathered in masses and lodged in palatial abodes at the public

expense                                         and parents were tempted, he believed, to suffer their  children to go  into
                                             ;

these places wliere they could get an excellent education witli all the advantages

of a co.«tly middle-class school at the public expense. The Scotcli people, with

proverbial natural .shrewdness, had perceived and warded off this danger which

was burdening England. Poor persons in Scotland were not tempted to throw

their children on the rates by providing them with these palatial edifices. Whereas

many such children in England cost from £20 to £30 per annum, the offspring of

destitute Scotch poor were as well or better cared for as a body for £10 each, being

trained imder careful supervision in healthy and well-selected houses amongst the

labouring classes, where they were never subject to the influence of the workhouse,

but were gradually and naturally introduced mto the wholesome conditions of

family and industrial life. This wise .system of supervised boarding-out was being

gradually adopted in England, and it was to be hoped that in a few years it might

become the general ride at any rate for pauper girls, There were altogether 573
2 10 REPORT--1876.

poor-law unions in England, of which 127 had adopted the boarding-out system in
greater or less degi-ee for some of their pauper children. There were, in addition,
forty-seven "Welsh unions, of which thirty had adopted the system. The number
of children boarded out was in England 1500, and in Wales 000. In nearly aU the
cases where tlie sj-stem had been applied it had been found very successful ; and the
writer of the paper supplied a large number of extracts from reports from Bir-
mingham, Clifton (Bristol), Chorltou (Manchester), the Cumberland Unions, and
the agricultural districts in Kent, showing that where the system was applied chil-
dren were cared for at the rate of from £10 to £12 a year, that the children
boarded out were improved in health, and had been readily drafted off into situ-
ations. The only cases in which the system had failed in accomphshing these blessed

results was where there had been a neglect of supervision. He therefore advocated
the formation of ladies' visiting committees in connexion with the miions. At pre-

sent the number of district and separate schools was very .«maU as compared -wdth
the number of pauper children. The erection of many such costly institutes was
attended witli pecimiary difficulty aud was of questionable expediency. On the
other hand, sound economy and efficient results were combined in the application

of the system of boarding-out, especially for children ; but the system should be
applied in its completeness aud entirety, and with frequent oversight by judicious
visitors, and provision for the religious and moral education of every child.

    The Statistics of the Indian Opium Revenue. By the Rev. F. S. Turner.

    The last debate on the Indian Budget in the House of Commons demonstrated

the vital importance of the opium revenue ; it'^is therefore important to inquire into
the probable stabihty of this revenue. At first sight an inspection of the returns

from 1792 to 1872 is highly encouraging. During this long term of years we mark

an increase, steady on the whole, though with minor fluctuations, from £202,751 to

£8,(i00,000. Not so satisfactory is the increasing relative importauce of the opiiun

revenue, which from being in 1792 one thirteenth of the land revenue, and one

twenty-eighth of the total revenue, has now risen to the serious proportions of more

than one third of the land-revenue, and more than one sixth of the total revenue.

These figures refer to the gross revenue, and have to be shghtly diminished for the

net revenue. Making the necessary deduction, opium has in eighty-three years

yielded the total net profit of £184,000,000, which may be taken as a partial set-off

against the sum which British rule has cost India during the same period.

    High authorities have warned us that we ought not to rely upon the continuance

of  this  income                                                         among  others.  Sir Charles Wingtield, six  years  ago, in  the House

    Our lucrative monopoly of the China market is threatened by the competition of

the Chinese themselves. This competition has been held in check by their own

government, which, however, has gradually relaxed its opposition, and now threatens

to abandon it altogether. The poppy has .spread enormously in China since 1863.

For the last four years there has been a diminution of our opium revenue, which

may be the beginning of a continuous decline. Some recent items of news fi'om

China show that there is still some imcertainty about the direction Cliinese policy

will take. J. S. SliU has pronounced against interference with the opium trade
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but, according to his own principles, an argument may be advanced in defence of

the Chinese prohibitory legislation. Great difficulties are throwu in the way of this

legislation in China \>y the political action of Great Britain. Thus opium may per-

haps stiU continue to bolster iip Indian finance imtil moral laws work out some

vmexpected, but not imdeserved, retribution.

              MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

Address hy Charles W. Mereifield, F.R.S., President of the Section.

It is generally most useful and most interesting to intelligent listeners to hear from

those who address them that which is the most familiar to the mind of the speaker.

Passing by the question of primary education, I propose, therefore, to re^^iew briefly

our shortcomings in those subjects of instruction which are the necessary preludes to

natiu'al, and especially to mechanical, science. I then propose to direct your atten-

tion to some points dependent on the crowding of the population, and especially to

those consequences of it which are chiefly interesting to the Section of Mechanical

Science.

  To such an assembly as I see before me it hardly needs that I should say much

on the importance of a widespread Imowledge, as sound and exact as it can be made,

Weof the nature of all things about us.  need this not only as a nation to compete

with other nations, but we also need it more and more every day as men. The

crowded condition of the earth at this day is in the strongest contrast to its state in

the early days of our race ; and the necessities of our life then and now are in aa
strong contrast as those two conditions, or as the numbers who lived and live sub-

ject to them. Even in the early days there was more knowledge afoot than the
thoughtless among us dream of. At no stage of man's history was life to be held
on easy terms, and to those who in early times neglected the knowledge necessary

to take care of themselves and those about them the penalty of their remissness was

short and sure. It is not less certain now. Equal difficulties and dangers stfll

--beset us, and are to be met with in the same way by acquiruig knowledge, and by

applying it with industry and judgment. Only the knowledge that we want is

greater now than then, and, being a higher development of knowledge, it reqidres

to be moi'e systematically learnt and taught. This is an absolute necessity to us if

we wish to extend, or even to preserve, the possibiHty of our maintenance in such

masses as are gathered together in Western Europe, and in such towns as London

or Glasgow.

Although the possibility of our existence as we are has been the consequence of

our ancestors, whether advisedly or not, yet successfully, following the law just

indicated, it is one of the concomitants of their success that we have brought up
amongst us the weak and foolish, who have recei-\ed the benefit of the knowledge

and industry of others without participating in either sufficiently to ruiderstand the

conditions which have rendered possible an ignorant, an idle, or a vicious hfe. Just

as the citizen of a coimtry which has been o\ev long at peace does not understand

that his safety depends upon the fighting power of himself and of those who will
take his part, so there are some in our midst who do not see the danger of ignorance

or the waste of idleness. Those among us are perhaps few who do not recognize

some disadvantage in ignorance and indolence ; but there are, I fear, many who fail
to realize the U]-gency of extirpating- both to the uttermost. Let me not be mis-

miderstood ; I do not suggest that there should be no pause from learning or from
exertion ; life would not be worth having vcithout its intervals of ease ; but the

enjoyment of these precious intervals is only to be purchased at the expense of

habitual thought and exertion ; and, in our present social condition, we cannot

safely neglect to afford to all amongst us opportimities of cultivating obser\-ation

and thought.

These remarks may seem to you something like " slaying the dead." To those

engaged in the active work of mechanical industry, ignorance, stupidity, and indo-

lence are the enemy at the gate, with whom there is and can be no truce. But let
me ask even you whether you lia^e not among your circle of acquaintance many

who think that the erudition of a few and the ignorance of the many Ls a better

state of things than the miiversal and systematic instruction which, happily for our-

selves, our representative assembly has now determined to secure for all amongst

us. Let me ask whether there are not some who think the study of history or

literature far more important than natural science ; some also who think that reli-

mygious teaching supersedes all other learning. All these doctrines are in  opinion
312 REPORT--1876.

false, and dangerous to society. I do not undervalue either religious teacliing or

historical knowledge. Of the former, this is not the place in which it would become

me to speak, even were I its authorized exponent. Of the latter it would be almost
equally preposterous to speak slightingly. No one feels more keenly or practically

than I do that the past is the key to the future, and that all our knowledge depends

upon experience. Not only do I acknowledge this as an abstract truth, but I have

myself constantly been driven to historical study before I could attain any real mas-

tery of the work which lay before me in any myof pursuits, even of natural science.

my myMoreover
habits and instincts have a strong bias in that direction,  early

education having been classical and legal, and my first actual employment having

been in the archasology of painting. It is, therefore, with no prejudice against

myuseful scholastic learning that I raise  voice against the misdirection of education.

Still less is it with any prejudice against the exactness of the knowledge to be

acquired.

 --Let us for a moment reflect upon what marks the difference between what we

are pleased to call civihzation and barbarism what distinguishes the Anglo-Ame-

rican from the lied Indian, the Russian from the Tartar, the Western European

and his colonial congeners from the races which he is governing or replacing. It is

not, or at least assuredly not alone, by muscular superiority, nor is it by mere

astuteness ; the savage or the half-savage competes witli us A"ery favourably in both

these respects. To emphasize the real difference, let us go a Httle further back, and

ask ourselves wh)- the b.^ar and the tiger are no longer a terror to us, and why we

feel secure of the predominance of man, at any rate against the larger and fiercer of

the dwc'Uers in the eartii, the Avater, and the air. This predominance is due solely

to the command which our intellect has given us o^'er the material powers of nature.

Physical science has enabled us to set these against tlie mere unaided strength of

brutes. Superior and more exact science has enabled the dominant races to bring

more of these material forces to bear upon their enemies than the barbarous tribes

could array against them. This is so universally admitted as a principle that its

real application is often forgotten; and there are many who thiidi that our ci\ilizatioii

has in it something sid generis, some special innate principle which assures us

against barbarian attack, instead of regarding it in its proper light, as merely one

element of strength which maj' turn the balance in our favour, provided we are

equally, or nearly equally, matched in other I'espects. But history is not wanting

in terrible less()ns of the utter destruction of ci\ilized communities. Long-continued

security and the accumulation of mechanical appliances carry with them and foster

the seeds of social decay.

These, perchance, are remote contingencies, although even to nations disaster

comes unexpected.

   More immediate and more obvious risks are these : that we may be beaten by

other nations, not in a struggle for bare existence, but in industrial competition,

and that the crowded population which has to be maintained in these islands, and

wliich former prosperity has accustomed to expensive habits of life, and not to the

endurance of scarcity or hardship, may not find the means of exchanging its labour

advantageously for the material of its sustenance ; or that ignorance of the condi-

tions of health, or inattention to its laws, may expose us to disease. Not all of us,
I conjecture, have realized how much more difficult and costlv it is to keep in pi'O-
sperity and health the enormous agglomerations of luunanity which Western Eu-

rope on the one hand, and China and India on the otlier present to us, than to feed

the scattered population? which occupy tlie less crowded regions of the globe. I

think some of us are now beginning at least to under,>tand that there are material

difficidties in keeping any large collection of one group of animated life together, so

that each indi\ idual shall not intercept or contaminate the sources of nourishment

of himself or of others.

  Now what I wish j'ou to reflect upon is, that these difficulties are material, and

mare therefore to be 3t by a thorough and widespread knowledge of natural science.

With thin populations, which have more to fear from war and famuie than from

want of elbowroom, political and histcnical knowledge in the governing class is more
important than exact natural knowledge in the administrative class. As the popu-

lation thickens, the latter assumes more and more relative importance ; and while I
                                                                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                        213

do not think political wisdom wiU ever lose any of its value, I think it only a part of

tliat political -wisdom to recognize that in such communities as ours tlie spread of

natural science is of far more immediate urgency than any other secondary study.

Whatever else he may know, viewed in the light' of modern necessities, a man who

is not fairly -\ersed in exact science is only a half-educated man ; and if he has sub-

stituted literature and history for natural science, he has chosen the less useful

alternati^e.

   One of the obstacles to the spread of science, and to our national prosperity, then,
I take to be the undue preference given to literaiy over natural knowledge, and, in

particular, the sacrifice of mathematical to classical study in the secondary school.

If you  ask   me why I lay so                                   much stress          on  mathematical  myteacliing,  answer is,

that we need to study natural science exactly and quantitatively, not merely to cram

our memory with the qualitative characters of a few phenomena. Now, if we are

to count, to measure, to weigh, or othermse to ascertain quantity, we are reaUy

practising arithmetic, geometry, and mechanics. If we can learn these more ad-
vantageously than by the orduiary course of mathematical study, we shall simply

change the form of that study without evading the thing. But in truth mathe-

matics are too well understood, and on the whole too sensibly taught, to admit of
any great subversions. Improvements in detaU, and in the selection of the most

useful branches for study, there is doubtless room for, and indeed these are being
daily made. The cliief faults I notice are in teaching algebra too late, and in
teachmg Euclid (so called) too early. I regard abstract geometry as a foolish

study, imless accompanied, and even to a certain extent preceded, by the practice

of linear drawing. This is too often neglected. Moreover, I do not consider that

-- --what is called Euclid I use this expression advisedly is the best possible text-

book for abstract geometry. I doubt if Euclid, if we judge him bv the best Greek
text handed down to us, is suited to our modern requirements. "What we actually

use is not Euclid, but only isolated portions of his book, freely altered by Robert

Simson. _ In my opimon the omissions and alterations have deprived the book of aU

lifelike vigour and human interest, and have made it as dull to the mature reader

as it necessarilv is to the unfortunate boys whose first introduction to geometry it

too frequently forms.

Apart from the general fault of giving too low a place to mathematical teacliing

(a great faidt, and one which we are only slowly mending) is our not paying suffi-

cient attention,                     and                        sufficiently  early  attention, to  mechanical  and geometrical

                                  _

drawing. On this pomt I need add but little to what was said by Prof. Fleeming

Jejikin in his address to this Section at Edinburgh in 1871. That is possibly the

point on which we compare least favourably with neighbouring countries. One
important remark of his I am anxious to gi\e prominence to, and that is, that de-

scripti^-e geometry is not what is wanted. I fear, indeed, that many teachers of tins

subject have failed to realize its true meaning, and confuse it with the theory of

geometrical projection, of wliich it is in truth a development and extension, not a

particidar application. So far as the preliminary chapters of an elementary work
on it are concerned, the collision is natural and perhaps not ^erv material ; for all

that relates to the point and straight line is simply plan and elevation, and the plane

needs but little more. But the characteristic feature of descriptive geometry is due

to the fact that surfaces cannot (with the exception of cylindrical surfaces) be

represented by plan and elevation. They are therefore, in this science, indicated

by a general and systematic method, which, without representing them to the eye,

enables us to handle them geometrically, to find their intersections, their tangents,

and their shadows, with the same certainty as if we had models before us. So far
as points and lines, straight or curved, are concerned, it does not differ from geome-

trical  projection                                         the  difference is, that it deals  effectually with  planes and curved
                                                        ;

surfaces, which geometrical projection cannot do. To those who have to deal with

curved surfaces it is as important as linear drawing is to the student of plane o-eo-

metry, because models are practically unprocurable, and conception in three dimen-

sions is not easily got, except through descriptive geometry. But for ordinary

school purposes it is a very barren exercise. I state this advisedly, being thorouglily
Afamiliar with both its use and abuse.
                                                                                     much more important exercise of geo-

metry^ and one more immediately useful, is the geometrical representation of arith-

metic, sucli as we see in diagrams of thrust, pressure, speed, work, temperature,

Leat, rainfall, and so forth. But I thiiik this will take care of itself provided linear

drawing be taught sufficiently early.

  I should leave my remaiks incomplete if I did not make what you may at first

sight think a digression, namely, some observations on our practice of teaching

languages, especially Jjatin aud Greek. But as they do form one side of education,
and as we should only be half-educated ^\ithout them, it is important that they
should be efl'ectuaUy and economically taught. And to none is this more important
than to those who need to use them, but who can spare little time from their more

essential study of natural science. I think all who value time wiU admit, if they

allow themselves independent reflection on the subject, that Greek aud Latiu are

taught too much as exercises of grammar and too little as languages. It is the same

fault as we have had in mathematics, where making boys learn Euclid has been

taken to be the same as teaching them geometry. Now teaching grammar and

" construing " bears to language the same relation that drill does to marching or

shooting, or that swimming on a table does to taking the water. In all these

matters we have learnt that moderate drilling and plenty of work is the best com-

bination                                         but we have  not yet  learnt this  lesson in reference to the classics.  Our
                                              ;

ancestors had learnt aud practised it. They spoke Latin in the schools, aud to this

the drill-work of grammar and sjiitax was the proper complement. I hope you

manage things better in Scotland ; but iu England it is the rule to spend from six

to eight years in learning Latin aud Greek, and it is the exception to be able to

read either.

If we cannot escape the effects of this scholastic tendency to exaggerate the

importance of intellectual gymnastics over actual knowledge iu classical and geo-

metrical teaching, let us at least do our utmost to prevent its being extended to

other languages aud to other studies. There is a class which is exerting pressure

that way.

I speak the more fearlessly on this subject, because, ha^ing most strongly advo-

cated the extension of pure mathematics, I cannot possibly be mistaken for an

objector to ex.act learning.

Now, returning to the subject of mathematics, I think one cannot fail to be struck

with the increa.-ing tendency which they exhibit to pervade all study of natural

science. I need not ask you whether it is wanted for mechanics. In the older

books on chenustry, elect)'icity, and so forth, it was quite an unusual thing to meet

with an algebraic formula or a geometrical theorem. Now, on the contrary, we

find that one half of chemistry is pure algebra : organic chemistry, iu particular, is

--nothing but a special branch of algebra coupled with the experimental I had
--almost said accidental fact that its formula are represented by actual combina-

tions. This disguised algebra enters so largely into chemical teaching tiiat I have

seen full marks obtained in an elementary examination paper on chemistry by
students who really knew nothing of the science, but who did understand algebra

well. I have recently seen a great deal of scientific work passing through the press,

and I have been much struck by the way in which pure mathematics continually

present themselves in all branches of knowledge. The reason is not far to seek.

We have passed the merely descripti'^'e stages of knowledge in most sciences, and

--when we come to quantitative study that is to say, to discuss number, nieasui'e,
--position, and force we are using mathem.atics, whether we know it and choose to

call it so or not. Moreo-\er, so far as we at present know, ordinary mathematics

are the simplest ways of counting and measuring.

I may mention, incidentalh', that I think there are evidences that mathematical

knowledge is spreading in many directions. Apart from what is doing in the uni-

versities and high schools, I have myself an oppoitunity of ob8er-\ ing it elsewhere,

as the examiner for elementary pure mathematics for the Science and Art Depart-

ment. This year, in particular, I am able to say that there has been a very marked

improvement in the Iniowledge of the candidates under examination, aud I think

the teaching of the science classes under the department is really beginning to tell

in this important subject. Compared with the requirements of this country, it is

but a small matter, for there are only about 7000 candidates annually, and these

candidates come up more than once. Nevertheless it is good so far as it goes, and

I hope to see a great extension of the instruction in this as well as in other

du'ections.

Assuming the possession of a certain amount of knowledge, which is now all but

uimersally spread, the only real difficulty of a thin population in a temperate

climate is the protection of life and property. That assured, they can without

Adifficulty supply their material wants in the way of animal and vegetable food and
of clothing.  very little and generally a very'easy selection ensures a sufficiently

pm-e water supply. Moderate cleanliness will secure sweet air in the houses, and,

except in the feus or in certain valleys, there is always pure air out of doors. 1 do

not assert that these conditions always exist in sparsely peopled countries ; it is

sufficient that they may, and sometimes do, exist.

Insecurity first, and therewith scarcity of food, have been sufficient causes in most

countries and in most times to compel aggregation. Towns, and even large cities,

are quite as much a consequence of barbarism as of ci\-ilization. The real problem

of civihzation has been to render hfe tolerable in such aggregations, and that problem
Weis only yet partially sohed.
                                shall see by-and-by that it is now presented to us

in a new and Aery troublesome form. It has always been a very difficult question,

arid the sacrifice of life due to its imperfect solution has been enormous, and is

still large.

  --Among the difficulties of town life I reclcon chiefly :

1. The insufficient supply of fresh air, whether from overcrowding within the

houses, or from narrowness or uuwholesomeness of the streets.

2. The mere proximity of individuals facilitating the spread of contagious or

infectious disease.

3. The getting rid of excreta or waste products.

A4. wholesome water supply to be provided and kept pure.

Of overcrowding I need not say much here ; the circumstances which determine
Fthat are the concern of Section rather than of the Mechanical Section. In this

country at least it does not fall to the engineer to plan new cities in the wilderness.
What he can do is to palliate the effects of overcrowding by suppljdng the means of

ventilation and cleanliness. I do not propose to-day to entangle myself in the

great and complex problem of  ventilation                                     yet  it  is  well  not  to  pass 'one  or  two
                                                                           ;

points unnoticed.

   It is rather difficult to say what pure air is. So far as health is concerned, the
wind oil' the sea or the mountain is pure, or as good as piu-e. Whether the east
wind be so or not is an open question. I suspect that its unpleasant character is

due more to its dryness, and consequently to its chilling effect-- an efl'ect quite

independent of its temperature--than to' any actual contamination. Meat and
milk, at any rate, will keep good with an east wind at least as well as with a west

wind. However this may be, we are all sensible that when we are to leeward
of a large town the wind smells of the town. Not to mention factories and

unsavoury trades, one day it has passed over miles of hot roofs and walls, and

streets of unclean dust ; another day, the rain or the watercarts have converted

miles of street into a reeking slough, compared with which a natural fen is a

cleanly thing. In any case we know and feel tliat we are breathing the waste
products of human industry and of human life, to the detriment of our vitality, as

well as to the offence of our nostrils.

I do not think sufficient attention has been paid to the mischief which may
Wearise from copious watering unaccompanied by careful scavenging.
                                                                                                               all know
what town mud consists of, its wliolesomest element being probably what makes

it look the worst, namely, soot. In Loudon there are hundreds of acres of mud and

dirt kept almost constantly moist, by rain when there is any, and by watercarts
Nowwhen there is not.
                       it seems to me tliat, merely looking at it from a broad

general point of view, this is not likely to be healthy ; "it seems to combuie all the

conditions necessary to the carrj-ing on of unhealthy putrefactive and Aeo-etative

processes on a very extensive scale. I do not pretend to estimate the quantitative

efiect of this as an element of disease, but I think it would be making a large

demand on your faith as well as mine to ask you to doubt its qualitative effect.
At any rate, I tliink we ought to consider veiy seriously wliether mere watering is
any proper substitute for careful and complete' scavenging, and wliether, in fact, we

                                                                                                          IS*

--are not spoiling a useful process by an unintelligible application of it one of tlie

great dangers of improvement.

 --The second point which I have mentioned-- the facilitation of contagious or

infectious disease by mere proximity is obvious enough in its generality. Its

details belong to Section D.

The atmosphere is probably a much greater carrier of noxious germs than water

but, as Dr. Tyndall has judiciously remarked, the aerial germs appear to be some-

times in a le«s forward, and sometimes, perhaps, in a more effete, state of develop-

ment than those which are met with in water, or which liave once taken root upon

moist tissues. On the average, therefore, resistance to them is probably easier.
However this may be, it is clear that we camaot subject the supply of atmospheric

air, which is necessary for our lungs and skin, to the same complete chemical or

mechanical treatment as we can, and do, when necessaiy, our supply of drinking-
water. Any attempt at the disinfection of air of doubtful purity must necessarily

be of the crudest and most empirical kind. In the present state of our know-

ledge and resources it can hardly be of interest to the engineer.

 --The third point affords a remarkable example of what I have just mentioned as

the greatest danger of all improvements their unintelligent use. No one can

deny that the watercloset and the sewer are great mechanical improvements yet
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

they ha^e been great carriers of disease. As applied to the particidar problem of

getting rid of waste products, especially solid products, I do not think they were

any improvement at all on much that we already had. In many towns in Great

Britain, where there previously existed a well imderstood and well carried out

scavenging system, I thinlv they have done more in saving trouble than in con-

ducing to health. I think the real key to the problem of getting rid of the nuisance

of waste products is to be found in the old aphorism that dirt is simply mntter out

of place. Hence the first step is to take care that such products shall not become

waste; and one condition of this is, that they should not be carelessly mixed. The

greater part of the sewage difficulty is, I think, simply tlie result of neglecting this

truth. It is especially the case with London sewage. With our water supply, our

watercloset system in houses, our drainage of houses, factories, and streets all

together, we ha^e accumulated a ri\er of filth, the complex admixture and

enormous mass of which lia\e rendered it most difficult and dangerous to control

--effectually. I tliink we sliall yet be driven to meet the difficulty at its source in

tlie way suggested by dealing with it in detail, subdividing both fi'om house to

house and I'rom kind to kind, and allowing notliing but the mere washings of the

streets to get into our sewers at all. So far as the getting rid of waste products is

concerned, I belie-\e we must be content to write off the whole cost of our Metro-

politan Main Drainage.

There is another undoubted improvement which the legislature has decided upon

applying to London, concerning which I feel no small amount of mii^givbg lest it

should be applied without intelligence ; and that is, the constant supply of water in

Asaplace of the intermittent cistern supply.  mere mechanical convenience it

will be a very great improvement ; but I foresee two dangers, one of sewage con-

tamination through the waterclosets, the other the waste of an article already

becoming scarce. The first is no idle fear. The experience of Croydon and other

places has shoAvn that it is possible to make the water supply and the sewage a

circulating system, with fever or cholera as its inevitable consequence. It has

been bad enough in several places of moderate size ; but in London, whether we

regard it with reference to the mass of contaminating material, or to the quantity

of human life to be affected by it, the risk has a much more serious aspect. I shall

be sorry to see the constant supply established in London without taking some

effectual seeiuity, either by the mterposition of cisterns or otherwise, to prevent

the possibility of back draught from the cess to the drinldng-water. Without some

such precaution, I think the mechanical impro%oraent may be a fatal gift.

I have said that the problem of the crowd, if I may venture so to call that of

maintaining purity in the supply of a deuse population, is now presenting itself in a

new and very difficult form.   That  is  so  notably in  the matter of  water supply
                                                                                                                               ;

because until now it has generaDy been possible, by some expenditure in aqueducts

and care in the selection of tlie sources, to obtain a sufficient supply of thoroughly

good water, not always perhaps of chemical purity, but at any rate free from any

great contamination of animal and espocially of huuinn excreta. Tliis possibility

threatens to disappear in the United Kingdom generally ; and especially so ^^·itll
regard to the manufacturing districts and to the east of England, not only from the

mere increase of the population, but much more from the higher cidtivation of the

land.  The  moorlands  are  everywhere  being  broken up for  the plough                                                        fallow-
                                                                                                                             ;

ing has given place to heavy manuring and to sewage irrigation, both of which are

freely applied to pasture as well as to arable land. The population of bullocks

and sheep has also increased with the human population. Tlie result is that tlie

rain is contaminated as soon as it reaches the ground. The surface di'ainage,

instead of being water naturally distilled, flowing otF clean grass or moss, is the

washings of manure. The spring-water, again, is not pure rain-water which has

passed tlirough a rock-filter and has taken up some mineral ingredients, but is

simply these manure washings more or less completely filtered. In our streams

the water derived from both these sources undergoes fresh exposure and cleansing

by aquatic vegetation, but at the same time fresh contamination. The mere

statement of the problem in this way carries with it, almost axiomatically, the

inference that the effective character of filtration is a matter for quantitative

Weinvestigation, not for assumption as perfect and complete.  know, moreover,

that some of these natural filters have been overtasked.

   Let us now turn aside to consider what is the work to be done, and what Ls, so
far as we are able to understand it, the work actually done by filtration.

  I believe I am right in saying that with the exception of the strong corrosives,

which act like weapons rather than as medicaments, no one really knows what

Wepoisoning is.  must take it as au expression used to summarize the imlmown

and possibly inscrutable chain of events of which we only see the primary cause

Weand the ultimate effect.  may perhaps go one step further in respect of the

pijisonous effect of organic sewage in its unfiltered form. It contains, for one

Athing, the dead products of organic decay.    grass filter or an earth filter very

rapidly renders this part of the sewage innocuous by oxidizing it. Then it con-

tains germs of animal life, some of which, unless intercepted or killed, prey para-

sitically on the larger mammalia. Thirdly, it contains vegetable germs, closely

allied, it would seem, to the moulds and other small fungi ; these, finding a resting-

place in our bodies, grow and destroy or spoil the cells of which our own gl'o^vth

consists, much in the same way that the yeast fungus modifies the worts of beer,

or that the common moidd spoils the flavour of a pot of jam. The effect of such

spores upon us is called zymotic disease. The first class of impurities is pretty

easily dealt with. Probably the means already exist of calculating at what point

any given filter will or wiU not be overcharged in respect of its defecating function

by the oxidation or entanglement of dead matter. But the question of the filtra-

Wetion of living germs is altogether more obscure.        know that many of them

are cauglit and effectually intercepted by both surfrtce and underground filtration ;

but we do not know in what proportion this intercepting takes place, eitlier on the

--average of all germs or with reference to each kind of germ which may be present
   different questions not always sufficiently distinguished. Then we also know

that the life of some germs is destroyed if their de^elupment be too long retarded,

liateman, Michael Scott, and others afterwards have described the remarlcable

effect which storing water in dark tanks has in keeping it clear, not only while it

Nowremains in darkness, but even under sub.*queiit exposure to light.                                                           we have

at present very little quantitati^-e or well-digested knowledge on these subjects. In

fact, little more is known of them than is contained in the crude statement which

WeI ha^·e just laid before you.  have no series of experiments to show what

or how many germs escape a given process of filtration or stm-age ; and it is not
evei-y germ that we need be afraid of: the greater part of them, probably, are quite

innocuous. All that the chemists have been able to give u^ is a dubious estimate

of the total quantity of organic matter (whatever that term may mean) which the

infiuent and effluent waters severally contain. They do not and caimot tell us in

what form the matter exists, whether dead or alive, animal or fungoid. Now for

many pui-poses the information so given is about as useful as it would be to know

that there is animal and ACgetable life in a gi-ven field, without being told whether
218 REPORT-- 1876.

it is com or couch grass, rats or rabbits. On this subject I thiiik both the engineer

and the chemist -n-ill but grope in the dark until the biologist comes to their aid,

working statistically with liis microscope as well as observing particular develop-

ments. Whether any observers are yet prepared by preliminaiy knowledge for such

investigations I know not, but sure I am that the need of them has come.
  It may be some consolation to the timid or fastidious among my listeners to be

assured, first, that only a few organic germs are capable of hurting us ; and,
secondly, that an overwhelming proportion of the germs of life perishes without

reaching maturity or attaining the power of doing mischief. This destruction goes

on to an extent little dreamt of except by those who have minutely examined the
question. It is not an exaggeration, but in many cases an under-statement, to say

that a million germs are produced in most of the lower forms of life for one which

e^er reaches the reproductive stage in its turn. Numerical evidence is easily

obtained of this in the case of ferns and lycopodiums and fungi among plants, and
of many worms and fislies and other creatures of lower organization among

animals. This constitutes at the same time our safeguard and our danger : a
safeguard, by the improbability of our meeting the few sur^ivors of this enormous
desti'uction ; a danger, from their rapid increase when they do happen to meet with

a resting-place favourable to their development.

  What is practically becoming most essential to us just now is to be able to pass

from vague generalities, such as these, to definite and quantitative statements.

  No doubt much may be done, and is daily being done, to come to the assistance

of these natural processes of purification by submitting water of doubtful quality to

various operations calculated either to remote certain classes of impurity, or to

avoid clogging or otherwise overtasking the natural or other filters. But at
present we are working in the dark, and empiiicaUy, in fact, applying quack

remedies at random, instead of setting to work systematically and intelligently.
Much fuller knowledge must be acquired before we can understand our business.

   In the meanwhile I think we must view with great and increasing distrust all

merely selective sources of water supply, and that, except perhaps in some favoured

localities, such as the best of the gathering grounds from which Glasgow is

happily supplied, we must not put too implicit confidence in any methods of

filtration or boring.

Besides, then, the general investigation which I have just spoken of, there

remain two alternatives to consider, each of daily increasing importance in certain

localities. One is the separation of the drinking from the ordinary supply ; the
other is the distillation of the drinking-water. Neither of these are new ; and
there are many places where they are of ob\dous necessity, and practised with the

greatest care accordingly. I think both require more attention than they have

received in this country.

   As regards the separation of supply, it surely is not seemly that where there is

no scarcity of water, but only a scarcity of wholesome water, the waterclosets and

factories and condensers of steam engines should be put in competition with the

dry throats of the people for the drinkable supply.

   The question of distillation also requires further study. There seems to be
no doubt that by subjecting water to sufficient heat we can destroy every living
germ in it, and that by distillation we may combine this with the removal of
almost all inorganic matter. At present the process seems to be rather expensive,

and brings it up to a price which is far too high for its general use. But I think
that when the process comes to be carefully gone into, with a view to working it

upon a very large scale, it may not be found impossible to effect a considerable

saving upon this cost. In fact, the mere necessity of delivering the distilled water   "

wat as 1 a temperature as possible, without the use of too much cooling material,

Weis a security for the employment of as little coal as possible.  should require

a settlement with the Excise to prevent the revenue suffering by fraud ; but no

doubt a compromise could be arrived at if the necessity were felt to be urgent.

  The collection and arrangement of my thoughts, with a view to the remarks
just addressed to you, has brought before my mind very strongly certain con-

siderations, some of which, being partly of a political character, I shall rather

indicate than discuss.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  219

    In the first place, there is an e-\ident and urgent necessity for the whole

question of tlie water supply, at any rate of England, bein<? much more tho-

roughly investigated and taken in hand than it has hitherto been thought

necessary.

    Secondly, there is need for the concentration of the business of the supply and
distribution of water (including frequently the management of the gathering
grounds), the roads, the lighting, and the drainage in one board for each town or
district, preferably the municipal authority. In London, where there is no such

concentration, the waste and inconvenience arising from the independence of the
road, gas, and water authorities in the mere matter of breaking up the roads is be-

coming a very serious consideration.
   Thirdly, there is a want of knowledge of natural science in the local governing

bodies, which is but ill supplied by their employment of professional officers. Much

more of it is wanted in the governing councils themselves before their technical
advisers can be either properly appreciated or properly controlled. Whether this
is to be got by the direct infusion of a professional element into the council itself,
or whether it is best to wait for the general spread of natural loaowledge, I scarcely

care e^en to form a judgment.
    Fourthly, it is a popular delusion, especially prevalent in this Section, that the

invention and pronsion of a mechanical convenience are necessarily an immediate

social benefit. There are many cases in which the direct effect is to facilitate
personal indolence or carelessness. It is then a positive evil, until, either by
natural selection or by experience, more careful habits have been re\erted to.
There are other cases in which the indirect consequences are more mischievous

than the direct advantages are beneficial. Here, again, there is no benefit until
those consequences have been met. There is a disadvantage which only attaches

to the immediate effects of some particular inventions. On the whole, of course,

invention is not only a good thing, but, together with discovery, a necessity of our
nature and of our existence. Meanwhile our immediate national necessity is a
wider, deeper, more exact, and more general spread of natural knowledge.

   The principal feature of this engine consisted of a combination of steam and
hydraulic cylinders, controlled by an automatic valve-gear, which enables the
eno-ineer to reverse the largest engines without assistance in a few seconds. This
is accomplished by the lever which opens and closes the steam and hydraulic
valves being hung partly on the reversing-lever and at its other extreme on the
weigh -shaft lever, so that any motion given to it and the valves by the engineer
in one direction is counteracted by the movement of the weigh-shaft lever to

blocks up their drainage outlets. The method employed was to lay a steel rope
all the length of the mud-bank, and, by means of Fowler's clip-drum placed in a
small steam-vessel, which had strong drag-harrows attached, to run the whole

apparatus rapidly from end to end of the rope. When the water discharged from

two very powerful centrifugal pumps was brought to bear after the dredge, a
marked effect was produced, and a channel was being rapidly opened deep enough
and wide enough to carry off the heavy rainfalls (sometimes as much as six inches

--in twenty-four hours) without having recourse to pumping a matter of gi-eat con-

sequence, as the expense and risk of pumping are large.

    The first portion of ground purchased for the works was in 1845, and consisted
 of 36 acres. At that time a wet dock and tidal basin were proposed, having a
 total water space of 17 acres and IG acres of quay space, the length of quayage
 being 1458 yards. Until within the last few years, however, the Clyde trustees
 were able to obtain ground on both margins of the river sufficient for the required
 quay extension, the river itself forming the water space, and requiring little ex-
 pense to make it available opposite the new quays.

    In 1864 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Company (now merged in the
 North British Railway Company) obtained an act to make a railway from their

 Helensburgh branch to the authorized docks, with a station immediately on the
                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  221

north side of the docks ; but nothing was done till 1870, when the Clyde trustees
obtained an act for enlarged docks &c., and the railway company an act for the

renewal of the site of the station.
   Under their act the Clyde trustees purchased additional ground, to enable them

to carry out the works now authorized. The large cartoon plan showed the general
outline of the docks and the diversion of the I'ointhouse Koad &c. The road is

55 feet wide, and extends from Sandyford Street to Stobcross Street, or a length

of 980 yards ; it has been formed entirely in cutting, the average depth being
29^ feet, the greatest depth 43^ feet, and the total quantity removed was nearly
300,000 cubic yards, of which about a fourth was boulder-clay. Only the
immense power of dynamite enabled this to be removed. The cost of the road,

including land, was about £45,000.
   The docks will be tidal, and, when complete, will afford 33^ acres of water

space 20 feet deep at low water, and will comprise three basins. The entrance
from the river is at the west end of the docks, and is 100 feet in width, communi-

cating with an outer basin COS feet wide at its widest part, and two inner basins,
270 feet and 230 feet wide respectively, the pier between being 195 feet wide. The

total area of quay space will be 27^ acres, and the length of quays about .3342 yards.
   The entrance will be spanned by a swing bridge, worked by hydraulic power,

and capable of carrying a rolling load of 60 tons. There will also be four coaling-
cranes, each capable of lifting 20 tons, also worked by hydraulic power. The

bridge, cranes, and the necessary hydraulic machineiy are being constructed by

Sir W. G. Armstrong & Co. The quays will also be provided with sheds, grain-

stores, &c., and lines of rails.

   From the borings made on the line of the quay-walls, it was ascertained that

the strata were of the worst possible kind in which to construct such works, con-
sisting as they do (excepting at the north-west corner, where boulder-clay was
found) of water-bearing gravel and sand, interspersed with pockets of mud, and

that to reach the rock with the foundations, except along a portion of the north

Aquay, would be out of the question.  longitudinal and a cross section of the site

of tile docks, showing the strata as ascertained from the bores, were shown on the

cartoons.

For the portion of north wall in the boidder-clay, and where the rock was within

a depth of about 40 feet under cope level, the usual section of wall has been

adopted ; but for the remainder of the walls and bridge-seat, where the sti-atum is of
sand and gravel &c., charged with an enormous quantity of water, especially imder

low-water level, and the rock at a depth of from 50 feet to 100 feet below cope-

level, the system of cyhnder substructure, recommended by INIr. Bateman and the

author of this paper in 18G9, and successfully carried into effect in the construction

of Plantation Quay wall and GO-ton crane-seat there, in 1870-75, was again fixed

Aupon.     small portion of the west wall of the dock is founded on sheet and bear-

ing piles where the boulder-clay suddenly dips, and a timber-wharf outside of the

dock-entrance, where the quay may be of a less permanent nature.
   The cartoons showed the general details of the whole of these walls, as well as of

the bridge-seat.

   The first contract, embracing the entrance and western portion of the docks'
walls, was let in August 1872, the amount being fuUy £100,000.

   The whole of the cyhnders are of concrete, composed of 5 of gravel or broken

stones and sharp sand to 1 of Portland cement of the strongest description, mixed

together by steam-power with the necessary water. The cyhnders for the quay-

waUs are about 27 feet 6 inches in height, made up of rings 2 feet G inches deep,

the thickness being 1 foot 11 inches. These rings are formed within wooden
moulds, on a platform, and, to facilitate hfting and break bond when built into the
cyhnder, they are divided into three pieces and fom' pieces alternately. The dividing

of the rings is effected by iron plates placed across the mould in the positions
required. The corbelling or bevelling of the bottom ring is done by placing con-
tracting pieces in the mould on which to shape the ring. The seat for the iron
washer on the top of the first, or " corbelled ring," and the holes for the bolts to

secure the same to the iron shoe are also formed in the moulding of the rings.
The concrete, as it is filled into the moulds, is well rammed with rammers weighing
2.22 REPORT--1876.

25 lb., so as to secure liomogeneity and a smootli surface. Twelve hours after
filling the moulds the division-plates are veithdrawn, and two days thereafter the
moulds are removed from the sides of the rings ; and in a period varying from nine
days in dry hot weather to three weeks in rainy weather, the rings are ready for
removal and building. The content of one ring complete is lOj cubic yards and
the weight 18 tons the heaviest portion weighs about 6 tons.

                                                                                                          ;

   The shoes are of cast-iron, 2 feet deep, of the same external shape as the bottom
of the cylinder, of 1-inch metal, with a bevelled inner shelf on which the corbelled
ring of tlie cylinder rests, and to which it is secured with a malleable iron ring or
washer, 5 inches by ^ inch thick, held down by Ij-inch bolts. The shoes of the
ordinary triune cylinders weigh about 4| tons each, and, for convenience in handling,
are made in six parts.

   In the construction of the cylinder substructure, a trench is made in the line of
the foundation (the bottom being about low-water level), of the necessary width,
and slopes of about 1| horizontal to 1 perpendicular, over vrhieh, or alongside, is
erected the necessary staging to carry tlie travelling cranes and digging apparatus.
The shoes are placed on the bottom of the trench in proper line and position ; the
concrete rings are then built up in rings of tliree and four pieces alternately,
pointed in cement, and the digging out of the sand or gravel &c. within the
cylinder-wells is commenced. Special diggers or excavators have been designed

for this purpose.

  A load of from 300 to 400 tons of cast-iron weights is generally required during

the sinking of each triune group of cylinders, to assist in sinking it to the proper
depth, which is 48 feet 7 inclies from the cope-level of the quay to the bottom of
the shoe. The average rate of sinking is about 12 inches per hour in good working

sand ; however, as much as 3 feet per hour has been attained.

  When each group of cylinders is sunk to the proper depth, the wells are filled

to the top with Portland-cement concrete, lowered to its place carefully.
   To effectually close up the apertures formed by the joining of each two gi'oups

of cylinders, a timber chock-pile, 2o feet long by 9 inches square, is driven behind,

anglewise, so that a sharp corner may bear hard against each of the cylinders.
   The foundation for the swing-bridge consists of twelve concrete cylinders, each

9 feet in external diameter, 29 feet in depth by 23 inches thick, formed in rings,
and resting on cast-iron shoes, as described for the quay-wall foundations. After
the cylinders were sunk, they and the interstices between them were cleaned out
and filled to the top with concrete, chock -piles being driven -where required. On
the cylinder-foundation thus formed, a stepped ashlar pier, 16 feet square at the
bottom and 10 feet square at the top, by 7 feet high, is erected, with a block of gra-
nite 7 feet square by 3 feet G inches deep, on which the centre lifting-press of the
bridge rests. This pier is surrounded by concrete rubble, the whole forming a
mass of masonry 36 feet 6 inches by 32 feet G inches by 10 feet 6 inches high.

   The foundations for the hydraulic rams, capstans, and side walls of the bridge-pit
are formed on single concrete cylinders placed apart and spanned between by brick
arches. The cartoons showed the details of the foundations.

   The first of the ground acquired for the docks was bought in 1845, at 6s. 6d. per
square yard, and the last in 1872, at 35s.

   The total cost of the docks, when fully equipped, will approach £1,500,000.

   This apparatus, for checking the downward movement of the cage, or hoist-box,

in case of the breaking of the suspending-rope or gear, consists of a mechanical
arrangement of levers, which expand through the intervention of a spring acting
upon the inner end of such levers through a sliding-sleeve, and so " strutting out,"
as it were, against the guides, or by gripping the guide-ropes, where ropes are em-
ployed instead of upright timbers.

On the Experiments made at the Gamp at Aldershot with a neiu form of Military
     Field-Railway, for rapid construction in war time. By J. B. Fell.

Field-railways are now recognized as being amongst the most important appli-

ances in modern warfare ; but hitherto it has been found impossible to have tliem

constructed with such rapidity as to be available for the transport-service at the

commencement of a war.
   The Crimean war was far advanced before the Balaclava railway was finished.

The Abyssinian war was over about the same time as the railway from Zoolla to
the Koomaglee Pass was completed.

   The railway made by the German army in the Franco-German war was not ready
for working until within a few days of the fall of Metz, when it became useless.

   The railway sent out to the Gold Coast was absnlutel}^ useless, and the difficulties
and dangers of the expedition were much increased by want of the means of trans-
port which the railway might have aflforded for the first 30 miles on the road to

Coomassie. Consequently the use of field-railways to a great extent depends upon
the rapiditj' with which they can be constructed.

   The cause of the partial failure of the military railways hitherto made is to be
found in the impossibility of executing the works of which ordinary railways con-

sist, such as cuttings, embankments, and masonry, with the rapidity necessary for

laying down a field-railway at the commencement, or even in the early part of

a war.

   Our Government have therefore had under consideration the practicability of
adopting some other method of construction by which the difiiculties hitherto
experienced might be overcome. For this object the Royal Engineer Committee
at Chatham have had a series of experiments carried out at the camp at Aldershot,
of which Captain Luard, R.E., and the writer of this paper had charge. The
experimental railway consisted of a succession of timber viaducts, which supplied
the place of earthworks, culverts, and bridges, and which, when the materials had
been prepared, could be erected with great rapidity. The conditions the Com-

mittee desired to have fulfilled in the trials were, that an engine, not exceeding six

tons in weight, should take a train of thirty tons up an incline of 1 in 50, and travel

at an average speed of 10 miles and maximum of 20 miles an hour. The waggons

were required to carry a load of three tons of dead weight each, and from 300 to

A500 cubic feet of bulky articles, such as tents, hay, and commissariat stores.

seven-ton siege-gun was to be carried on two waggons ; and it was to be shown to

be practicable to construct one mile of railway per day over such ground as was

selected by the Committee at Aldershot, by the labour" of 500 men.

The experimental railway was one mile in length, the gauge 18 inches ; steepest

gradient 1 in 50, the sharpest curve 3 chains radius, and one of the viaducts was

660 feet in length and 24 feet in height. The structure was of a simple form, and

consisted of two beams, which were bolted to a kind of trestle-work supports,

which were sunk to a depth of 12 inches and firmly fixed in the ground ; the rails*

being laid on the beams, completed the railway, for the construction of which no

other than military labour was required.

The experiments occupied at intervals a period of twelve months, and the Com-

mittee came to the conclusion that the result of the trials had proved that the

above-named conditions had been in every respect complied with and exceeded.

It had been shown that a sino-le line of field-railway, constructed on the system

employed at Aldershot, would be capable of can-ying ammunition and commissa-

riat stores sufficient for the supply of an army of l00,000 men                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       that a double line,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

and day and night service, would be capable of supplying an army of 300.000 men
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

that a single line of railway could be made, over ground similar to that at Aldershot,

224 REPORT--1876.

would be possible to construct a field-railway at the speed at wbich an anuy of

100,000 men could marcli.

Besides the Royal Engineer Committee, a considerable number of civil and

military engineers, both English and foreign, were present at the experiments.

In the course of the trials and subsequently improTenieuts have been made in

the form, materials, and details of the structure, by which the canying powers and

the efficiency of the railway have been considerably increased.

  An ordinary transport ship accompanying an expedition would carry the materials

and rolling-stock for 12 miles of field-railway, and the ' Great Eastern ' steam-ship

would carry from 70 to 80 miles.

   The cost of the mile of railway at Aldershot, with sidings, stations, and rolling-
stock was £.3500, and a similar railway of 2 feet 6 inches or 3 feet gauge, to be

worked by engines of ten tons weight, and waggons canying loads of six tons each,
could be made for about £-5000 per mile, the cost of erecting included.

Although a railway made on the system above described could not be expected

to carry the same amount of traffic as oue 4 feet 85 inches gauge, made in the

ordinary way, it would be quite capable of performing the whole of the transport

service for a large army in the field in a more efficient manner than it could be
done by horses, at a much less cost to the country, and, in the opinion of military

authorities, the value of such an improved method of transport in war-time could

Ascarcely be overestimated.                             difficulty, and perhaps the priucipal one remaining

to be overcome, in practically carrying out this or any similar improved form of

field-railway, is the necessity of incurring the expense in peace time of making pro-

vision for a future war ; and no Administration would willingly assume the respon-

sibility of such increased expenditure unless it were approved and required by the

public opinion of the country. It is therefore desirable that publicity should be

given to the experiments already carried out by the Government at Aldershot,

and that the subject of the best method for the rapid construction of field-railways

in war-time should be fully and freely discussed.

                                               By Capt. Douglas Galton, C.B., F.B.S.

Tn recent years a considerable development of these lines has taken place. The

railway in the                          United States is the pioneer  road                           it  must  be  made  as  cheaply as
                                                                                                  ;

possible at first, and improved as population increases.

   There are at present 7973 miles projected and 2700 completed. The Denver
and Rio Grande is intended to be 1700 miles long, of which 210 miles are com-
pleted. The estimate of cost of a narrow-gauge line in a prairie country is given
by the promoters at £1900 per mile for line and £7-58 per mile for rolling-stock.

1 ascertained that the cost of the Montrose railway (28 miles long) was £2300 per

mile, with two locomotives, two passenger-cars, one baggage-car, and thirteen

freight-cars. This is a purely agricultural line, running up into a country up a high

elevation, and with small traffic. The Parker and Karns City railway cost £5500

a mile                                  but it is only  10 miles long at present, and has an equipment of four loco-
                                     ;

motives, five passenger-cars, forty-six freight-cars, and a viaduct 400 feet long and

74 feet high. This line is for opening out an oil district.

   The curves on the lines are in some places 120 feet radius, and some gradients
are as much as 1 in 40.

 --The rolling-stock is as follows: Engines for passenger traffic have a rigid

wheel-base of 6 feet 6 inches, with four driving-wheels (coupled) of from 3 feet to

3 feet 4 inches diameter ; the weight on each driving-wheel from 2 tons 4 cwt. to

2 tons 8 cwt. ; total weight of engine from 24,000 lb. to 32,500 lb.

   Freight-engines have six wheels coupled, and the wheels are from 33 inches dia-
meter in some patterns to 40 inches diameter in others, and the weight on each

driving-wheel is from I4 to 2 tons ; the total weight of these engines is 20,000 lb.

to .38,000 lb.

   In the cars, the wheels are 24 inches diameter ; they weigh from 15,000 lb. to
17,000 lb., and carry thirty-six passengers ; they weigh from 410 lb. to 470 lb.
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                          225

per passenger. The 4 feet 8 inch gauge cars weigh from 28,000 lb. to 33,000 lb.,

and carry from fifty to seventy passengers, or from 500 lb. to 000 lb. per passenger.

The 3-foot gauge cars are 7 feet wide, whicli allows double seats on one side
and single seats on the other, with an aisle down the centre. Recently the cars

Jiave been increased to 8 feet in width, which allows of four seats abreast, or a total

of forty-seven passengers.

   The freight-cars have wheels of 20 inches diameter. The covered freight^car

weighs 10,000 lb. as against 17,000 lb. or 18,000 lb. for similar cars on the

4 foot 8 inch gauge ; and the narrow-gauge cars carry 8 tons as compared with
10 tons carried on the standard gauge. Thus a train of sixteen cars of the stan-

dard gauge would load twenty cars on the narrow gauge, and the total weight of the
narrow-gauge train would be 200 tons against 290 tons for the standard gauge,

i. e. a saving of 30 tons, equivalent to 22 tons of additional freight.

Thus on the narrow gauge the paying load bears a greater proportion to the dead

weight than on the standard gauge.

But the heavy weight of cars on the standard gauge has been brought about by

necessity of strength to resist shocks received in course of traffic.

The narrow gauge has been hitherto constructed so as to be as light as possible,

and the scantlings have been made in proportion to gauge ; but evidence is already

given of a desire to increase the weight ; and the weights carried on the cars show

that it is probable increased strength, i. e. weight, will have to be resorted to.

   The great width which is coming into use for the cars, e. (/. 8 feet on a base of
3 feet, must be unstable ; and I do not think that this mode of increasing the pro-
portion of paying weight can stand. But if cars of 8 feet wide are run, but little

economy can be claimed for the 3-foot gauge on the ground of diminished width

of railway.

The longer tracks of tlie United-States railways enable all the plant to pass

easily round curves, and the use of radial axles also contributes to that end ; and

there was at the Exhibition the Miltimow axle, of which a specimen which had run

12,000 miles was shown, in which the wheels move on the axle independently of

Athe axle ; this materially diminishes friction on curves.  train with these axles

has been running on the 3-foot railway in the Centennial grounds. These ap-

pliances enable the standard gauge to be constructed with curves practically as

sharp as those on the 3-foot gauge.

   The weight of rails depends on weight of engine : a standard-gauge engine can
be made as light as the 3-foot-gauge engine ; but the light engine will not draw
heavy weights up the steep inclines necessary for a line which follows the contours

of the groimd. In the United States the 3-foot gauge has the conveyance of cars

which can be more easily moved at stations than the cumbrous cars of the stan-

dard gauge.

The break of gauge entails a cost for transhipment of from 10c?. a ton where the

traffic is regular to Is. Gd. to 2.<. a ton where it is intermittent. The line may be

useful as a pioneer line ; but when the traffic becomes large it will have to be con-

Averted to the standard gauge.        standard-gauge line would answer all purposes,

if made with a light rolliurr-stock.

Astones in order to insure its stability.
                                           water-tight dam is thus formed, and the

excavations for the foundations may be further protected by the insertion of piles,

either driven or screwed into the inner slope of the dam and also into the opposite

side of the cutting. The piles have vertical gi-ooves, into which a timber boarding

may be slipped, thus formmg a thoroughly dry box-dam in which foundations may

be built in situ ; or if no such box-dam be formed, the foundations may be sunk by

means of excavators.

For the construction of bridge-piers in open water, the site may be dredged to

the required depth and clay deposited, so as to form an embankment rising above
water-level, down tlirough which an excavation is made and the foundations built,
or through which they may be simk; they may also be floated into position.

To construct subways beneath water, the river-bed is dredged, and clay mixed

with ground chalk and cement deposited so as to form a water-tight roof to the

operations, and the subway may be formed by tunnelling through the body of the

clay, gi'ound chalk, and cement, if deposited in sufficient quantity.

   The foundations may be formed of masses of stone masonry, brickwork, or con-

crete, whose horizontal section consists of two members at right angles to one

another, these members being hollow, to permit of excavation being carried on in

their interior while being sunk. Tongues or grooves of a semicircular or other

shape are formed on the ends of one of the members, the other constituting a

counterfort.

For the purpose of facilitating the sinking of foundations, the toe or bottom

should be surrounded with a shoe or curb.

The author then described at length the drawings which were exhibited.

In conclusion he stated, it is of the utmost importance that every facility should

be given to the free action of the ebb aud flow of a river, because an obstruction

weakens its action, thereby withdrawing a certain amount of force from its power.

The advantage of these walls is that they otter comparatively little resistance to

the water.

   Walls of this description might be faced with hard rubble-stone of from 3, 4, 5,
6, 8, and 10 cwt. each, the remainder of brickwork or concrete. Iloman cement or
hydraulic lime ground with mine-dust or puzzolano might be used with advantage

in the work if of rubble built in situ.

 WWhen the deposition is of great depth, as in the Clyde, varying from to 90 feet

in some places, the breadth of base cannot be overestimated, more particularly
where subject to great weights. From tliis construction a base of 32 feet or more

would be obtained, thereby giving great stability, also affording accommodation for

water-, gas-, and sewage-pipes.

The alveus or channel of a river is subject to move upwards as well as sidewise,

from causes not always in the immediate vicinity but at a distance.

    Importance of Hydro-Geolocjical Surveys from a Sanitary point of view.

                               By Baldwin LATHAir, C.E.

   The author in his paper pointed out that all subterranean stores of water were
due to the rainfall percolating into the earth, but that there were matters which

aftected the quantity of water percolating, such as the nature of the outcrop of the
strata receiving the rainfall, the volume of the strata, the lithological character,

and the free communication between different parts. The water held in store in

the earth did not, as a rule, maintain a horizontal level, but the surface possessed
a considerable fall in directions corresponding to the points of the discharge of the

springs. The inclined surface of the water pointed to its movement in the direc-

                                                                                       i

tion of its outfitll or natural vent. The water-level, therefore, of subterranean

strata meant a line drawn from the highest point at which it accumulated to the

lowest point of vent. The inclined surface of the water was the measure of the

element of friction and molecular attraction which interfered with the free dis-

charge of the water, so that it was retained in subterranean reservoirs and but

slowly discharged from them. The subterranean currents obeyed the same laws,

with reference to their How, as streams which move on the surface of the earth.

A number of examples were given as to the rates of fall of subterranean water, and

also as to the elevation to which water did rise in particular years in the earth. It
was shown that the elevation of the subterranean water between the town of Wat-

ford and the highest spring which issued from the chalk liills was 300 feet in a

distance of fourteen miles, and between the Colne and the River Thames at

London Bridge, a distance of fourteen miles, the water fell at the rate of 13 feet

per mile. Near the Middle Chalk the rate of fall varied from 13 feet 6 inches to

19 feet (3 inches per mile, and in the Tertiary beds at Garrett the fall was 5 feet

per mile, and in the same formation at Waltham Abbey 4 feet per mile. The well
Aof Grenille, iu the Lower Greensand, indicated a fall of 2 feet per mile.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           table

was given showing the rate of fall of subterranean water in the neighbourhood of

Croydon, which was shown to vary from 8 feet per mile to 94 feet per mile ; and

the subterranean water, as ascertained by wells sunk in the boulder-clay at East

Dereham, Norfolk, showed that the water-level varied from 2 feet in a mile in the

flat tableland to 100 feet in a mile in the valleys. The author pointed out the

importance of pure water with regard to health, and gave several examples showing

the deleterious effects of the drainage from cesspools and cemeteries upon water-

supply and tlie health of the persons using it; he also pointed out the importance

of iiscertaining the direction in which subterranean water was moving, in reference

to the construction of wells and cesspools, and that a small amount of considera-

tion with regard to the relative positions of the well and cesspool in a coimtry-

house^ may make all the diti'erence between rendering it healthy or unhealthy.

With regard to epidemics of enteric fever, whether directly ascribed to water or

milk, the author observed that in every case recorded the water had invariably

been procured from wells ; and while it was singular that so much attention was

paid to the pollution of rivers flowing over the surface of the ground, which had

never been traced to be the cause of disease, no one had thought of the great evils

which had residted, and would result, from the pollution of underground sources

of water-supply. The object of the author was to direct attention to this impor-

tant subject, and to point out that where the use of cesspools was unavoidable,

there were ways in which they might be introduced without the possibility of

polluting the water-supply when it can only be procured from a local well.

On the Strength and Fracture of Cast Iron. By W. J. ^Iillar.

The object of the present communication is to describe certain phenomena

observed by the writer when engaged in testing cast-iron bars.

The bars were about 40 inches long, 2 inches deep, and 1 inch broad. Th&

distance between supports (or span) when placed in testing-machine wasSG inches.

The load was aj.plied gradually and at ctutre of span.

In general the bars broke with straight fractures                                                                                                                                                                                                                          the direction of fracture being
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

in line of application of load. In some cases, however, curved forms of fracture

were observed.

During the course of testing it was observed that the curved fractures divided the

span more or less unequalh-, whilst the straight fractures, with few exceptions,

divided the span into equal portions.

After a carefully conducted series of experiments, the writer finds that the

form of fracture conclusi\e]y points out the position of fracture, viz. that bars

showing straight fractures have broken at or close to centre of span, whilst bars
228 REPORT 1876.

showing curved fractures ha^e broken at points more or less removed from centre
of span, and that in general the curve of fracture increases with distance of fracture
from centre.

   In all cases the fractured parts were found to fit exactly together, no piece of the
metal being thrown out on fracture talcing place ; and where the fractures were
curved the line of fracture pointed towards point of application of load, the results
of several experiments showing that fracture commences at the convex side of the
bar and passes upwards, gradually curving towards centre of span.

   The curved fractures occur also in bars of 1 square inch section, their forms not
being, however, so well marked as in the bars already referred to.

   With a view to obtain the relati\ e strength of bars showing straight and curved
fractures, a note was kept of the hreaking loads, deflection, forms, and positions of
fracture, the result of which is given in Table I.

   (The results given in ths following Tables are all from bars of 2 inches deep,
1 inch broad, and 36 inches span.)

   From these experiments it appears that the " set " decreases with successive

applications of the same load.

   This decrease of set also appears to obtain even when the load applied is an

increasing one.

                   On a New Form of Lamp. By E. Lavender.

   The construction of the lamp is a glass lantern 18 inches square, with a funnel or
chimney 24 inches high, into which is introduced a jet of steam about ^\ inch
across when the pressure of steam is about 201b. to 301b. per square inch; if
the pressm-e is less the jet must be larger, if higher smaller, the object of the jet

--being to create a partial vacuum in the lantern the consequence 'feeing that the

surrounding air is forced through the burner of the lamp and causes a very com-
plete combustion of the oil.

  A very brilliant light is produced, which is increased partly owing to the pro-

ducts of combustion being continuously removed and a volume of fresh air being

introduced.

   The lamp or biumer is constructed for a circular wick, and upon the principle of
admitting the air to play upon the outside of the wick, and also by a disk another
column is thrown upon the inside of the wick ; another current of air is also
carried through the centre of the flame. The metal cap is constructed so as to
bring the flame into a centre, through the orifice of which it is drawn by the jet of
steam in the chimney. The oil supply is contained in a shallow vessel, which is
heated by a jet of steam before being burned, as many of the oils that may be used
would become thick in cold weather.

   The results obtained from a 4-inch wick have been equal to a light of upwards
of six hundred sperm candles, the cost of which, with oil at 9d, per gallon, is under
Irjl. per hour. The oil was supplied by Messrs. Young's Paraffin Light Company,
and is a product from shale and is a part of the oil that hitherto has been of

little use.

   The cost of burning an open fire, such as is used at many pit-heads, is from ten

to twelve hundredweight of coal per night ; it is a most uncertain and dangerous

light.

   Whilst the author's lamp was designed for collieries, loading-banks, sheds,
sidings, ships, &c., he thinks that it will be of great service to the public.

       On Boiler Incrustation and Corrosion. By F. J. Rowan.

The importance of the subject is alluded to, especially to marine engineers, who

have most keenly felt its difficulties, while the range of interests involved by it is

as wide as the use of steam.

The present state of general information about it being unsatisfactory, we have

to seek in a combination of chemistry and mechanical science for the needed eluci-

dation of its problems.

   The course of investigation has been marked by the suggestion of various em-
pirical remedies, which are pointed out, but which have failed to reach any good

result, the actions to be counteracted not being understood.
   Incrustation and corrosion are not one action, but dissimilar ones, although they

are often found united in boilers, and therefore both must be noticed.
   Incrustation is first considered, Dr. J. G. Rogers, of Madison, U. S., being quoted

(from ' Chem. News,' vol. xxvi.) for the non-conductibility of crusts and the pro-
portionate increase of temperature which their presence in boilers renders necessary.

   Boilers subject to incrustation are divided into two classes :

   1. Land boilers using natural fresh waters ; and

   2. Marine boilers using sea-water.
   1. The average quality of natural fresh waters is illustrated by analysis of Eiver-

Clyde water, as formerly supplied to Glasgow ; and an analysis also by Dr. Wal-
lace of crust deposited from that water is given. The case is then quoted of the
boilers at a mill in Barrowfield still using that water, but in which the formation

of crust is prevented by the use of a quantity of soda-ash.
   The action of soda-ash under these circumstances is described; it causes the'

decomposition of the sulphate of lime and rapid deposition of the neutral carbonate

as powder. Where bicarbonate of lime is present, it is also precipitated as neutral
carbonate in a powdery form, one equivalent of carbonic acid being liberated.
Neutral carbonate being thus formed rapidly, has not power to adhere to boiler

surfaces ; while, if deposited slowly by heat from the bicarbonate, it is crystalline

and does adhere.
   M. Bidard of Rouen, author of papers on this subject in ' Annales Industrielles,'

has made numerous examinations of boiler-crusts, which show, according to him,
that organic matter has power to agglomerate carbonate of lime and form crust
by a process of " baking." His opinion is quoted from one of his letters to the

author.

   Fresenius, quoted in a paper by Dr. Wallace in ' Proc. of the Phil. Soc. of Glas-
gow,' vol. iv., ascribes this agglomerating power to sulphate of lime. Bidard's

explanation applies where carlDonate and not sulphate of lime predominates, because
sulphate is able to form crusts where no organic matter is present, as in some

crusts from marine boilers. The use of too much soda-ash is inj urious, and pre-

cautions are given, with a little further illustration of its action in boilers.

    It is proposed to apply it in the feed-tanks or cisterns generally attached to
boilers, allowing the lime to be deposited there to save constant blowing off.

   Various other preventives of incrustation are noticed, including De Hiien's
method of using barium chloride and milk of lime, founded upon the investiga-
tions of J. Y. Buchanan (Roy. Soc. Proc. vol. xxii.) , and some details of comparative

cost in working with this process are given from Dingler's Polyt. J. ccxvii.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                _

   As the most complete preventive of incrustation, which is otherwise scientifically

desirable, the author advocates the use of surface condensers in connexion with

land boilers.

   2. Although modern systems of marine engine practice have removed incrusta-

tions from marine boilers by the introduction of surface condensation, there is still
some necessity to consider incrustation as applying to them, because of a tendency
to return to the ancient regime in consequence of difficulties with corrosion. The
evil effects of incrustation are felt more heavily in marine practice from its con-
ditions of using sea-water, which contains a large amount of solids, and of limited

space for carrying fuel and chemical reagents and for repair of boilers.

   The inappHcability of the chemical method is pointed out, reference being made

to experiments of Mr. Jas. R. Napier, F.R.S., published in Proc. Phil. Soc. Glasg.

vol. iv.

Working with  fresh water is  the  only  sensible and  efficacious  method                                  but when
                                                                                                         ;

crusts found at various pressures, are added, with remarks on some of these by

Dr. Wallace (from Proc. Phil. Soc. Glasg.), and extracts from a paper in Dingler's

Pol)^;. J. ccxii., by Dr. Ferd. Fischer, confirmatory of these remarks, and showing
the influence of elevated temperature and pressiu-e on the decomposition of various

 salts in water.

  --Corrosion. Causes of corrosion of exterior of boilers are briefly glanced at,

including damp settling, accumidation of damp ashes and of soot, accompanied by

careless tiring, which causes sulphur, acids, and other corrosives to combine with

the soot.

    \s'\ih regard to corrosion of the interior of boilers, investigations on various cor-
roding forces are first quoted. Prof. Grace Calvert's experiments on the action of
sea-water and of various gases on metals are alluded to, to prove that sea-water
exerts such an action upon steel and iron, that carbonic acid, in presence of water,
acts energetically, and that distilled water, free from gases, has no action.

   The application of these researches by W. Kent (of the Stevens U.S. Institute

of Technology) to the examination of the corrosion of iron railway-bridges in the

United States is then referred to ; and the investigations of A. Wagner (from

Dingl. Polyt. J. ccxviii.), on the influence of various solutions on the rusting of iron,
are quoted. This author corroborates Calvert's report of the action of carbonic

dioxide, and notes the fact that the presence of chlorides of magnesium, ammonium,

sodium, potassium, barium, and calcium in water largely increases the production
of rust, the action of chloride of magnesium alone being increased by heat.

   These facts correspond with that observed by J. Gamgee, that lime solutions
used as media of congelation in ice-making corrode the pipes or channels which
convey them.

    Stingl's valuable contribution to this subject, viz., his paper on the effects of
condensed water containing grease on boilers fed with it (Dingier, Polyt. J. ccxv.),
is quoted at some length.

   This author proves that gi-ease, with a small quantity of salts of lime and mag-

nesia, at a temperatiure not exceeding 60° to 70° Cent., forms lime-soap, which,
under the influence of a higher temperature, partially decomposes iuto free fat
acid and a basic lime-soap, which adheres to the boiler-surfaces, the free acid,
which is usually oxalic acid, attacking and dissolving the iron. In the crust the
fat is recognized by the addition of hydrochloric acid, the separated organic mass
being afterwards shaken with ether.

   Even with lime and magnesia salts present in very insignificant proportion, the
presence of grease is injurious, as, with saponification, under considerable pressure,
a small quantity of lime suffices to occasion the splitting up of a neutral fat into
free fat acid and glycerine. With low pressure the same action proceeds more

gradually.

   Various cases of corrosion from greasy water are noticed by this author, and in
particular that of a steam-boiler of Cornish design, into which the condensed steam
from two engines (of 300 and 100 horse-power) was fed. This boiler was con-
structed of steel ; and after only three weeks firing was leaking in the fire-tubes.

A deposit was found adhering to the upper part of the tubes, of which the analysis

is given. The water in the boiler had a milky appearance, which was at once re-
moved by ether. Ether is recommended as a good qualitative test for the presence

of grease in water.

   The analysis of the condensed feed-water is given, and the various operations in
testing the deposit from it also recorded.

   Means were adopted to purify this water by precipitation of the calcium carbo-
nate and part of the magnesium carbonate along with the grease, which was can-ied
down with the precipitate, and by subsequent filtering ; and the analysis of the
purified water is given. The boiler afterwards worked for three months with this
water without any bad results, a pure deposit, consisting principally of magnesium
hydrate and calcium cai-bonate and sulphate, being found to a small extent on the

surfaces of the boiler.

   Finally a letter addressed by the author to ' Engineeiing ' (Oct. 1874) is
referred to, in order to call attention to the difference between pure natm-al waters
and genuine distilled water, i. c. distilled water free from air. The difference con-
sists in the presence of gases in all natural waters. The distilled water from sur-

                                                                                              20*

face condensers of steamers necessarily contains some air, and it is therefore not
"genuine distilled water."

   Examples of boilers subject to corrosion are classed under tbe heads :
   1 Land boilers using natm-al fresh water ; and
    2. Marine boilers.
    1. Loch-Katrine water, from its gi'eat pmity, affords the best opportunity of
studying the effect of pure natural water on boilers. The former water-supply of
Glasgow having been calcareous, the boilers using it became coated with lime, and
did not suffer in consequence when afterwards supplied fi-om Loch Katrine. In
cases where the lime coating was removed corrosion quickly set in, and new boilers
working with Loch-Katrine water from the first were rapidly destroyed. Several
examples illustrating these points are quoted, and the remedy adopted is described.
This was the formation of an artificial coating of lime by feeding a whitewash for
some time into the boilers.
   Analysis (by Dr. Mills) of Loch-Katiine water is given ; and by reference to the
investigations of Calvert and Wsgn^r its action on iron is explained.

  --2. Marine Boilers. Those using exclusively fresh water ai'e cited, viz. Rowan

and Horton's and Perkins's, to illustrate the kind of corrosive action known imder
these circumstances. The author's letter to ' Engineering' gives the remedies used
in the case of Kowan and Horton's boilers.

   Another instance of a coasting steamer using nearly all fresh water in her boilers,
which, however, were destroyed by corrosion, is quoted. This instance was com-
municated to the Graduate section of the Institute of Engineers in Scotland by
Mr. Jas. Gilchrist. It was found by two chemists that the decomposition of ii'ou
in her boilers was caused by the use of tallow. The author points out that the
chemists did not make allowance for the presence of a small quantity of sea-water
in the boilers, and its decomposition setting free hydi-ochloric acid.

   The description of corrosion given by Mr. Miller in his paper communicated to the
Cleveland Iron-Trade Foremen's Association is quoted, as this author enters fully
into the matter, and describes two examples which well illustrate the general
practice of the day in marine engineering. His deductions from the circum-
stances of these two examples are combated ; and the author proceeds to show that
corrosion in marine boilers, where a proportion of sea-water is used, is due to de-
composition of the magnesium chloride of the sea-water, and to the liberation of
the carbonic acid held in solution by repeated boUiug.

   The popular error that corrosion is due to some change produced in the constitu-
tion of water by redistillation is pointed out, as is the fact that in no case of marine
practice has distilled water, pure and simple, ever been present so that its efiects
might be examined.

   The author proposes as a remedy the coating of all new boilers with calcium
sulphate and magnesium hydrate artificiallj', and thereafter the exclusive use of
fresh water, which does not dissolve such a coating.

                     On an Apparatus for cleaning Filtering-Sand.
                           By John Lang, C.E., Kirlccaldy.

   The sand is tipped from wheelbarrows into a box, in the under part of which
there is a diaphi-agm pierced with many small holes, through which a supply of
water under pressure is introduced. The sand is agitated by the cm-rent, and the

mud and water flow over the top of the box. When the water Hows over clear, a

door in the side is opened, the clean water is discharged into wheelbarrows below
and is conveyed to the filter. The size of the apparatus depends altogether on the
mag-nitude of the supply of water, and its success depends on the size being adapted

to the supply. From very many experiments with various sands, the best con-

ditions were found to be that the water should pass through the box with a
velocity of from 3 feet 9 inches to 4 feet per minute, and that the box should be
27 iuclies in height. This apparatus, as used in the Kirkcaldy and Dysart Water-
v/orks, had been found, in respect to tlioroughness and in economy, to be very
greatly superior to the former machines. It is able speedily to wash fresh pit-

sand, or to rewash the sand foimuig the body of the filter ; but it was explained

that it was unable to wash the impmities fi-om the filter-scrapings. Neither the

old machines nor any mechanical means even in the laboratoiy are able to do this.

By cai-eful experiments, samples of the mud on the surface of the Kirkcaldy filters

were obtained separate from the underlying sand ; and it was found that 100

parts of the mud consisted of about 9o parts of diatoms, 4 parts of animalcules,

and 1 part of inorganic matter, beside the sarcoid matter of the diatoms from

which the oifensive smell of the mud is derived. The only way to recover the

sand from these scrapings is to allow them to lie exposed to the air for some

years, until the sarcoid matter is decomposed. The flinty valves of the diatoms

Amay then be removed by washing.  portion of the mud passes below the siu'face

into the body of the filtering-sand, and in course of years is spread through its

interstices and reaches even to the bottom. This mud consists almost wholly of the

frustules of two minute kinds of diatoms, Orthosira and Cymhella ; and by means

of the microscope, used sand may be at once distinguished from fresh sand by the

presence of these. They are easily removed by washing.

On a Pneumatic Tramway Car. By W. D. Scoit-Monceeiff.

                  On an Elevating Steam Ferry. By Wm. Simons.

   The object of this vessel is to supersede the present inclined approaches or slips
to'ferry stations, and therefore lessen the wear and tear in horses and haulage, to
enable a gre<ater traffic to be conducted with greater dispatch and economy and
on the same level as the adjoining quays. The valuable ground required for slips
is unnecessary, and the ferry-steamer is not confined to a special berth or locality.

   To effect the above objects, it is proposed to construct a steamer with a centre
platform of sufficient capacity for the traffic, and capable of being elevated and
lowered to suit the rise and fall of the tide, and thus enable the vessel to receive
{level with the adjoining quays) waggons, goods, horses, caniages, and passengers.
