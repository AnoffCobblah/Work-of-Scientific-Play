xlviii .  --REPORT 1872.

Report of the Council for the Year 1871-72 p^'esented to the General
        Committee at Brighton, on Wednesday, August 14th, 1872.

   At eaeli of their Meetings during the present year, the Council have
received a Report from the General Treasurer, and his Report for the year
will be laid before the General Committee this day.

   The Council have to announce that a vacancy has occurred in the number

of the Trustees in consequence of the death of Sir Roderick Murchison.

   The Council take this opportunity of expressing their regret at the great

loss which Science has sustained by his death. Ho worked long, eai-uestly,

and with eminent success in the Sciences of Geology and Geography, and was

at all times a steady patron of rising Scientific Men in all branches of Science.
He was a Member and strenuous supporter of this Association at its first

formation in 1831, and continued until the close of his life a very constant
attendant at its Meetings and a firm promoter of its interests.

   The Council recommend that Sir John Lubbock, Bart., be selected to fill

the vacancy.

    The list of Sectional Officers, which the Council will submit to the General
Committee, has been arranged in accordance with the resolution of the
General Committee at the Meeting at Edinburgh in 1871, viz. the Section
of Biology has been divided into the three Departments of Anatomy and
Physiology, Anthropology, and Zoology and Botany, and the Council have
designated the Chairmen and Secretaries to take charge of the several
Departments.

    In accordance with the following resolution of the General Committee at
Edinburgh, viz. :

       That the President and General Ofticers, with power to add to their

          number, be requested to take such steps as may seem to them desi-

            rable in order to promote observations on the forthcoming Total Solar

              Eclipse,

a Committee was formed, consisting of the President, and General Officers of
the Association, Professor J. C. Adams, Sir G. B. Airy, Astronomer Royal,
Professor Clifton, Mr. De La Rue, Dr. Frankland, Mr. Hind, Mr. Lassell,
President R.A.S., Lord Lindsay, Mr. Lockyer, General Sabine, General Stra-
chey, Colonel Strange, and Professor Stokes ; and a Letter was addressed by
the President to the First Lord of the Treasury, requesting the Government
to contribute £2000 towards the expenses of the Expedition, to aflford to the
Expedition the assistance of a Government Steamer to convey the parties
composing it to the Stations for observation selected on the Coasts of Ceylon
and India, and to obtain for the Expedition the cooperation of the Governor-
General of India and of the Governor of Ceylon.

   Her Majesty's Government acceded to the request contained in this letter.
The Expedition was formed by the Committee, and proceeded to Ceylon and
India in the charge of Mr. Lockyer and Dr. Thomson. The Governor-General

of India and the Governor of Ceylon forwarded the objects of the Expedition
by all means in their power.
       REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  xlix

    The report of the proceedings and results of the Expedition will be pre-
sented to the Association by the Eclipse Committee in the usual course.

    The Council have received a communication from the Royal Astronomical

Society, informing them that that body contemplated printing, in a separate

volume of their Transactions, the results of the observations of the Solar
Eclipses of 1860 and 1370; and that, under these circumstances, they con-
sidered it would be advantageous to Science to publish, in the same manner,
the results of the Observations made in 1871, under the auspices of the
British Association; thus presenting a llecord of aU these Observations in

one uniform Series.

   The Council resolved to accept the proposal of the Council of the Royal
Astronomical Society, and they appointed a Committee, consisting of Mr.
"Warren De La Rue, Colonel Strange, Dr. Huggins, and Mr. Lockyer, to
arrange the necessary details with the Council of the Royal Astronomical

Socictj-.

   Thei-e were five other resolutions referred to the Council for consideration

--or action, upon which the proceedings of the Council have been as follows :

   First Hesolution.--" That the President and Council of the British Asso-
ciation be authorized to cooperate with the President and Council of the

Royal Society, in whatever way may seem to them best, for the promotion of

a Circumnavigation Expedition, specially fitted out to carry the Physical and
Biological Exploration of the Deep Sea into aU, the Great Oceanic areas."

  A copy of this Resolution was forwarded to the Royal Society, and a Com-

mittee was appointed, consisting of the President and Officers of the Asso-

ciation, Dr. Carpenter, Professor Huxley, Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, Mr. C. W.

Siemens, and Professor "Williamson, and authorized to cooperate with the
Committee of the Royal Society in carrying out the objects referred to in the
Resolution. The Expedition has been organized, the ship ' Challenger ' is
being fitted out at Sheerness, Captain Nares has been appointed to the com-
mand, and Professor Wyville Thomson (who has obtained three years' leave
of absence from the University of Edinburgh) is appointed to the Scientific
charge, with an adequate Staff under him. It is hoped that the Expedition

--will sail about the end of November.
   Second Besolution. " 1. That it is desirable that the British Association
apply to the Treasury for Funds to enable the Tidal Committee to make

observations and to continue their calculations.
    " 2. That it is desirable that the British Association should urge upon

the Government of India the importance, for navigation and other practical
purposes, and for science, of making accurate and continued observations on
the Tides at several points on the coast of India."

   The Coimcil added General Strachey to the Committee on Tides. The
Government of India, iipou their application, have agreed to defray the
expense of making Tidal observations in India, and of causing the experi-
ments to be reduced according to the methods devised by the Committee on

Tides.

    In pursuance of the first part of this Resolution, the Cnnmittce on Tides
being authorized by the Council to make an application to the Government,
presented the following Memorial to the Lords Commissioners of II. M.

Treasury :

1872.
1 REPORT 1872.

" To the H'lglit Honourable the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury,
     The Memorial of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

" Humbly Sheweth,

   " 1. That in the year 1867 the British Association appointed a Com-
mittee 'for the purpose of promoting the extension, improvement, and
harmonic analysis of tidal observations.' From that time until the present,
under Committees reappointed from year to year, the proposed work has been
carried on. The mode of procedure adopted, and the results obtained up
to the mouth of August 1871, are fully stated in the accompanying series of

printed reports.

   " 2. The primary object of the investigation is the advance of tidal science ;
but the Committee have uniformly kept in view the practical application
of their results to Physical Geography, Meteorology, Coast and Harbour

Engineering, and ITavigation,

A" 3.  large mass of valuable observations recorded by self- registering

tide-gauges during the last twenty years having been found available, the

Committee have applied themselves in the first place to the reduction of

these observations, and have deferred the object of promoting observations

in other localities until the observations already made have been utilized to

the utmost.

   " 4. The work thus undertaken has proved, as was anticipated, most
laborious. The calculations have been performed, under the superintend-
ence of Sir William Thomson, by skilled calculators recommended by the
Nautical Almanac Office. The funds required to pay the calculators, and fo
print and prepare Tables, forms for calciilation, &c., to the amount of =£600,
have been granted by the British Association in four successive annual
allowances of .£100 each, and a sum of .£200 voted at the last Meeting.
The last grant barely sufficed for the work actually in hand, and to secure
the continuance of the investigation additional funds are necessary. The
Council of the British Association therefore directed the Tidal Committee to
make an application to the Government for assistance, the amount at present

asked for being limited to .£150.

   " 5. It seemed to the Council that after the Association had done so much
in the way of actual expenditure of time by the Members of its Committee,

and had given such a large contribution from its very limited funds, enough

had been done to show the object to be one for which assistance may
reasonabljr be expected from Government. On representations made by

Colonel Walker, Director of the Trigonometrical Survey of India, the Indian

Government has already granted the means of defraying the expense of

making Tidal Observations in India, and applying to them the methods of

reduction devised by the Committee of the British Association. The Council

hope, therefore, that the Government of this country may be similarly dis-

posed to assist in a matter of national importance.

                               (Signed)      " AVilliam THOirso:N-,

                               President of the British Association."

" May 21, 1872."

The Council regret to state that the application was rejected upon the

grounds explained in the following letter :

                                             " TreaBui'v Cbambers,   "*

                                                                                                                       3rcl June, 1872.

--" SiE, The Chancellor of the Exchequer has referred to tlie Lords Com-

missioners of Her Majesty's Treasury the Memorial of the British Association
          REPORT or THE COUNCIL.                                           ;K

for the Advancement of Science, forwarded to him with your letter of 21st
ultimo, praying for Government assistance in connexion with Tidal Obser-

vations.

" I am to state that their Lordships have given their anxious attention to

the Memorial, and they are fullj^ sensible of the interesting nature of such

investigations, but that they feel that if they acceded to this request, it

would be impossible to refuse to contribute towards the numerous other ob-

jects which men of eminence may desire to treat scientifically.

" Their Lordships must, therefore, though with regret, decline to make a

promise of assistance towards the present object out of the public funds.

          " I am. Sir,

                                     " Your obedient Servant,

                                     (Signed)             " William Law."

" Sir W. Thomson, Atlienceum Chtb."

 --Tliird Hesolufion. "That the Council of the Association be requested to

take such steps as to them may seem most expedient in support of a proposal,
made by Dr. Buys Ballot, to establish a telegraphic meteorological station at

the Azores."

   The Council appointed a Committee of their own body to report upon this
proposal. The Committee after due deliberation reported that, while sympa-
thizing with the proposal made by Dr. Buys Ballot, they cannot recommend
a grant of money to be made by the Association for carrying it out. In this

--recommendation the Council concur.
    Fourth Hesolufion. " That the Council be requested to take into con-

sideration the desirability of the publication of a periodic record of advances

made in the various branches of science represented by the British Associa-

tion."

   The Council, after a careful consideration of this proposal, are not prepared
to recommend the Association to undertake the publication of a periodic
record of advances made in the various branches of science represented by
the Sections of the British Association. They are of opinion that in so vast
an undertaking special Societies should be invited to pi-epare such records,
the action of the Association being limited to occasional grants in aid. They
are of opinion, however, that the Association would do well to promote the
more frequent publication in their Proceedings of critical reports on vai-ious
branches of science, of the same nature as those which have alreadj' rendered

--previous volumes so valuable to investigators.
   Fifth liesohition. "1. That the Council of this Association be requested

to take such steps as may appear to them desirable with reference to the
arrangement now in contemplation to establish 'Leaving Examinations,' and

to report to the Association on the present position of science-teaching in
the public and first-grade schools.

   " 2. That the Coimcil be requested to take such steps as they deem wisest

in order to promote the introduction of scientific instruction into the ele-
mentary schools throughoitt the country."

   A Committee, consisting of the President and the General Officers, Mr. G.

Busk, Dr. Debus, Dr. Duncan, Mr. Fitch, Professor M. Foster, Mr. F. Galton,
Dr. Hirst, Professor Huxley, Sir John Lubbock, Bart., Sir J. Paget, Bart.,
Ecv. Professor Price, Professor Henry J. S, Smith, Professor Stokes, Professor
Tyndall, and Professor "VVilHamson, was appointed to consider the first of

these resolutions, and to report on them to the Council.

                                                                 d2
--Hi iiEPOiiT 1872.

   la accovdauce with the rocommendatiou of this Committee the Coaucil
adopted the following Resolution :

       That, having had under consideration the requests which the Committee
          of Masters of Schools have made to the Universities of Oxford and
           Cambridge upon points in which the Education of the Universities
           and Schools came into contact, the Council of the British Association
           recommend that Arithmetic, and cither Elementary Physics or Che-
           mistry experimentally treated, be introduced into the Leaving Exa-
             minations as compulsory subjects.
                That the Head-Masters of Public Schools be requested to furnish
             the Council with information about the present position of Science-

              teaching in their Schools.

 and the Council have communicated thereon with the Universities of Oxford
 and Cambridge, but at present no decision respecting " Leaving Examinations "
 has been arrived at in these Universities.

     In accordance with the terms of the resolution passed by the General
 Committee last year, appointing a Committee on Science Lectures and Orga-
 nization, the action proposed to be taken by this Committee in the following
 resolutions, was referred to the Council and sanctioned.

     1. That a Subcommittee, consisting of Dr. Carpenter, Prof. Williamson,

 Prof. W. G. Adams, Dr. Hirst, Mr. Geo. Griffith, Di. Michael Foster, and

  Prof. E.oscoe be appointed for one year for the purpose of preparing a list
 of Lecturers for the consideration of this Committee, and of communicating
 with the various towns with the view of establishing a system of Science
  Lectures throughout the countiy.

     2. That the names of the proposed Lecturers be selected (with their
 consent) from amongst the Members of the General Committee of the
  Association, or from amongst the Graduates of any University in the
  United Kingdom ; and that the subjects ixpon which the Lectures be de-
  livered shall be such as are included in one or other of the Sections of the

  Association.

     The Committee have drawn up a Report, dealing generally with the sub-
 ject of their inquiry, which the Council recommend should be referred to tho
  Committee of Recommendations.

     The Council have had under consideration tlie question of enabling
  Members, who are unable to be present at tho Meetings, to obtain the

 --Journal and other Printed Papers, and they have adopted a Regulation as

   follows :

      The Journal, President's Address, and other Printed Papers issued by the
  Association during the Annual Meeting will be forwarded daily to Members
  and others, on application and prepayment of 2s. Gd. to the Clerk of the
   Association, on or before the first day of the Meeting.

      The Council regret to have to announce that the state of health of
  Dr. Thomas Thomson renders him unable to continue to act as one of the
  General Secretaries of tlie Association after the present Meeting. They
   cannot refrain from expressing their great regret at the loss of his valuable

    services.

      The Council have agreed to recommend that Professor Michael Foster,
   F.R.S., be appointed one of the Genei-al Secretaries in his place, and his
  name will be proposed to the General Committee at the Meeting for the
  Election of the Council aud Officers on Monday next.

      The Council have added the following names of gentlemen," present

                                                               OF

       WILLIAM B. CARPENTER, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S.,

                                    PRESIDED.

      My Loeds, Labies, and Gentlemen,

Thiett-sii years have now elapsed since at the first and (I regret to say)

--the only Meeting of this Association held in Bristol, which Ancient City

 followed immediately upon our National Universities in giving it a welcome,

--I enjoyed the privilege which I hold it one of the most valuahle functions

 of these Annual assemblages to bestow ; that of coming into personal relation

with those distinguished Men whose names are to every cultivator of Science

 as " household words," and the light of whose brilliant example, and the
 warmth of whose cordial encouragement are the most precious influences by
which his own aspirations can be fostered and directed. Under the Presi-
 dency of the Marquis of Lansdowne, with Conybeare and Prichard as Yice-
 Presidents, with Vernon Harcourt as General Secretary, and John Phillips
 as Assistant Secretary, were gathered together Whewell and Peacock, James

Forbes and Sir W. Rowan Hamilton, Murchison and Sedgwick, Buckland and
De la Beche, Henslow and Daubeny, Roget, Richardson, and Edward Eorbes,
with many others, perhaps not less distinguished, of whom my own recollec-

tion is less vivid.

    In his honoured old age, Sedgwick stiU retains, in the Academic home of

his life, all his pristine interest in whatever hears on the advance of the
Science he has adoraed as well as enriched ; and Phillips still cultivates
~vvith all his old enthusiasm the congenial soil to which he has been trans-

-- --planted. But the rest, our fathers and elder brothers, "Where are

they ? " It is for us of the present generation to show that they live in our
lives ; to carry forward the work which they commenced ; and to transmit
the influence of their example to our own successors.

   There is one of these great men, whose departure from among us since last

--we met claims a special notice, and whose life full as it was of years and
--honours we should have all desired to see prolonged for a few months, could

its feebleness have been unattended with suifering. For we should all then

have sympathized with Murchison, in the delight with which he would have
received the intelligence of the safety of the friend in whose scientific labours
and personal welfare he felt to the last the keenest interest. That this in-

telligence, which our own Expedition for the relief of Livingstone would have
--kx KEPORT 1873.

obtained (we will hope) a few months later, should have been brought

--to us through the generosity of one, and the enterprising ability may I not
--use our peculiarly English word, the " pluck " of another of our American

brethren, cannot but be a matter of national regret to us. But let us bury
that regret in the common joy which both Nations feel in the result; and

while we give a cordial welcome to Mr. Stanley, let us glory in the prospect
now opening, that England and America wiU co-operate in that noble object

-- --which far more than the discovery of the Sources of the Nile our great

Traveller has set before himself as his true mission, the Extinction of the

Slave Trade.

   At the last Meeting of this Association, I had the pleasure of being able

to announce, that T had received from the First Lord of the Admiralty a
favourable reply to a representation I had ventured to make to him, as to the

importance of prosecuting on a more extended scale the course of inquiry

into the Physical and Biological conditions of the Deep Sea, on which, with

my coUeagaes Prof. Wyvillc Thomson and Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys, I had been

engaged for the three preceding years. That for which I had asked was a

Circumna\'igating Expedition of at least three years' duration, provided with

an adequate Scientific Staff, and with tlie most complete Equipment that our

experience could devise. The Council of the Eoyal Society having been

led by the encouraging tenor of the answer I had received, to make

a formal Application to this effect, the liberal arrangements of the Go-
vernment have been carried out under the advice of a Scientific Com-

mittee which included Bepresentatives of this Association. H. M. ship
' Challenger,' a vessel in every way suitable for the purpose, is now being
fitted out at Sheerness ; the Command of the Expedition is intrusted to

Captain Nares, an Officer of whose high qualifications I have myself the

myfullest assurance ; while the Scientific charge of it will be taken by

excellent friend Prof. Wyville Thomson, at whose suggestion it was that

these investigations were originally commenced, and whose zeal for the

efficient prosecution of them is shown by his relinquishment for a time of the

important Academic position he at present fills. It is anticipated that the

Expedition will sail in November next; and I feel sure that the good wishes

of all of you will go along with it.

myThe confident anticipation expressed by  predecessor, that for the utili-

zation of the total Eclipse of the Sun then impending, -our Government would
" exercise the same wise liberality as heretofore in the interests of Science,"

has been amply fulfilled. An Eclipse-Expedition to India was organized at
the charge of the Home Government, and placed under the direction of Mr.

Lockyer ; the Indian Government contributed its quota to the work ; and a

most valuable body of results was obtained, of which, with those of the pre-

vious year, a Beport is now being prepared under the direction of the Council

of the Astronomical Society.

   It has been customary with successive occupants of this Chair, distin-

guished as Leaders in their several divisions of the noble Army of Science, to

open the proceedings of the Meetings over which they respectively presided,

with a Discourse on some aspect of Nature in her Belation to Man. But

--I am not aware that any one of them has taken up the other side of the

inquiry, that which concerns Man as the "Interpreter of Nature;"

and I have therefore thought it not inappropriate to lead you to the con-

sideratiou of the Mental processes, by which are formed those fundamental

conceptions of Matter and Eorce, of Cause and Effect, of Law and Order,

which furnish the basis of all scientific reasoning, and constitute the Phi-
. ADDRESS.  Ixxi

losojMa prima of Bacon. There is a great deal of what I cannot but

--regard as fallacious and misleading Philosophy "oppositions of Science falsely
--so called " abroad in the world at the present time. And I hope to satisfy

you, that those who sot up their oivn conceptions of the Orderly Sequence
which they discern in the Phenomena of Nature, as fixed and determinate

Laius, by which those phenomena not only are within all Human expe-

rience, but always have been, and always must he, invariably governed, are

really guilty of the Intellectual arrogance they condemn in the Systems of

the Ancients, and place themselves in diametrical antagonism to those real

Philosophers, by whose comprehensive grasp and penetrating insight that
Order has been so far disclosed. For what love of the Truth as it is in

Nature was ever more conspicuous, than that which Kepler displayed, in his

abandonment of each of the ingenious conceptions of the Planetary System

which his fertile Imagination bad successively devised, so soon as it proved

to be inconsistent with the facts disclosed by observation ? In that almost

admiring description of the way in which his enemy Mars, " whom he had

left at home a despised Captive," had " burst aU the chains of the equations,
and broke forth from the prisons of the tables," who does not recognize the
justice of Schiller's definition of the real Philosopher, as one who always
loves Truth better than his System ? And when at last he had gained the
full assurance of a success so complete that (as be says) he thought bo must
be dreaming, or that he had been reasoning in a circle, who does not feel the
almost sublimity of the self-abnegation, with which, after attaining what

was in his own estimation such a glorious reward of his Hfe of toil, dis-

appointment, and self-sacrifice, be abstains from claiming the applause of
his contemporaries, but leaves his fame to after ages in these noble words :

" The book is written ; to be read, either now or by posterity, I care not
" which. It may well wait a century for a reader, as God has waited six

" thousand years for an observer."

   And when a yet greater than Kepler was bringing to its final issue

--that grandest of all Scientific Conceptions, long pondered over by his

almost superhuman intellect, which linked together the Heavens and the
Earth, the Planets and the Sun, the Primaries and their Satellites, and

included even the vagrant Comets, in the nexus of a Universal Attraction
establishing for all time the truth for whose iitterance GaHleo had been con-

--demned, and giving to Kepler's Laws a significance of which their author had

never dreamed, what was the meaning of that agitation which prevented the
Philosopher from completing his computation, and compelled him to band it
over to his friend ? That it was not the thought of his own greatness, but
the glimpse of the grand Universal Order thus revealed to his mental
vision, which shook the serene and massive soul of Newton to its founda-
tions, we have the proof in that beautiful comparison in which he likened
himself to a Child picking up shells on the shore of the vast Ocean of Truth

    a comparison which will be evidence to all time at once of his true Phi-

losophy and of his profound Humility.

   Though it is with the Intellectual Eepresentation of Nature which we call

Science,th.dAwe are primarily concerned, it will not be without its use to cast
a glance in the first instance at the other two principal charactei's under

which Man acts as her Interpreter,--those, namely, of the Artist and of the

Poet.

   The Artist serves as the Interpreter of Nature, not when he works as the

mere copyist, delineating that which he sees with his bodily eyes, and which

we could see as well for ourselves ; but when he endeavours to awaken within
Ixxii                                     --REPORT 1872.

US the perception of tliose beauties and harmonies which his own trained"

sense has recognized, and thus impart to us the pleasure ho has himself derived

from their contemplation. As no two Artists agree in the original constitu-

tion and acquii'ed habits of their Minds, all look at Nature with different

(mental) eyes ; so that to each, Nature is tvliat he individually sees in her.

   The Poet, again, serves as the Interpreter of Nature, not so much when

by sliilfiil word-painting (whether in prose or verse) he calls up before our

mental vision the picture of some actual or ideal scene, however beautiful
as when, by rendering into appropriate forms those deeper impressions made

by the Nature around him on the Moral and Emotional part of his own

Nature, he transfers these impressions to the corresponding part of ours.

For it is the attribute of the true Poet to penetrate the secret of those mys-
terious influences which we all unknowingly experience ; and having dis-

covered this to himself, to bring others, by the power he thus wields,

--into the like sympathetic relation with Nature, evoking with sliilful touch

the varied response of the Soul's finest chords, heightening its joj's, assuaging

its griefs, and elevating its aspirations. Whilst, then, the Artist aims to

picture what he sees in Nature, it is the object of the Poet to represent what

he feels in Nature ; and to each true Poet, Nature is ivhat he individually

finds in her.

The Philosopher's interpretation of Nature seems less individual than that of

the Artist or the Poet, because it is based on facts which anj' one may verify,

and is elaborated by reasoning processes of whicli all admit the validity.

He looks at the Universe as a vast Book lying open before him, of which he

has in the first place to learn the characters, then to master the language,

and finally to apiu'ehend the ideas which that language conveys. In that

Book there are many Chapters, treating of different subjects ; and as Life is
too short for any one man to grasp the whole, the Scientific interpretation of

this Book comes to be the work of many Intellects, differing not merely in-

the range but also in the character of their powers. But whilst there are

" diversities of gifts," there is " the same spii'it." While each takes his

special direction, the general Method of study is the same for all. And it is

a testimony alike to the truth of that Ifethod and to the Unity of Nature, that

there is an ever-increasing tendency towards agreement among those who rise
--it aright
                                       ;  temporary differences of interpretation being removed, sometimes

--by a more complete mastery of her language, sometimes by a better appre-

hension of her ideas ; and lines of pursuit which had seemed entirely distinct

or even widely divergent, being found to lead at last to one common goal.
And it is this agreement which gives rise to the general belief--in many, to

--the confident assurance that the Scientific interpretation of Nature represents

her not merely as she seems, but as she really is.

   But when we carefully examine the foundation of that assurance, we

find reason to distrust its secinity ; for it can be shown to be no less

true of the Scientific conception of Nature, than it is of the Artistic or the

Poetic, that it is a representation framed by the Mind itself out of the

materials supplied by the impressions which external objects make upon the

Senses ; so that to each Man of Science, Nature is what lie individucdly believes

her to be. And that belief M'ill rest on very different bases, and will have

--very unequal values, in different departments of Science. Thus in what are

commonly known as the " exact " Sciences, of which Astronomy may be taken

as the type, the data afi'orded by precise methods of observation can be made

the basis of reasoning, in every step of which the Mathematician feels the

fullest assurance of certainty ; and the final deduction is justified either by
ADDRESS.  Ixxiii

--its conformity to known or ascertainable facts, as when Kepler determined
--the elliptic orbit of Mars; or by the fulfilment of the predictions it has

sanctioned, as in the occurrence of an Eclipse or an Occultation at the

precise moment specified many years previonsly ; or, still more emphatically,

--by the actual discovery of phenomena till then unrecognized, as when the '

Perturbations of the planets, shown by Newton to be the necessary results of

their mutual attraction, were proved by observation to have a real existence

or as when the unknown disturber of Uranus was found in the place assigned
to him bj^ the computations of Adams and Le Verrier.

  We are accustomed, and I think most rightly, to speak of these achieve-

ments as triiimphs of the Human Intellect. But the very phrase implies that
the work is done by Mental Agency. And even in the very first stage of the

--process the interpretation of observations there is often a liability to serious

error. Of this we have a most noteworthy example in the fact that the esti-

mated distance of the Earth from the Sun, deduced from observations of the

last Transit of Yenus, is now pretty certainly known to be about three

millions of miles too great ; the strong indications of such an excess afi'orded
by the nearly coincident results of other modes of inquiry having led to a

reexamination of the record, which was found, when fairly interpreted,

-- --fully to justify if not even to require the reduction. Even the veri-

fication of the prediction is far from proving the Intellectual process by

which it was made to have been correct. For we learn from the honest
confessions of Kepler, that he was led to the discovery of the Elliptic orbit of

Mars by a series of happy accidents, which turned his erroneous guesses into
the right direction ; and to that of the passage of the Eadius Vector over equal
areas in equal times, by the notion of a whirling force emanating from the Sun,
which we now regard as an entirely wrong conception of the cause of orbital
revolution *. It should always be remembered, moreover, that the Ptolemaic
system of Astronomy, Avith all its cumbrous ideal mechanism of " Centric and
Excentric, Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb," did intellectually represent all that

the Astronomer, prior to the invention of the Telescope, could see from his actual
standpoint, the Earth, with an accuracy which was proved by the fulfilment

of his predictions. And in that last and most memorable anticipation which

 has given an imperishable fame to our two illustrious contemporaries, the
inadequacy of the basis afforded by actual observation of the perturbations
 of Uranus, required that it should be supplemented by an assumption of the
 probable distance of the disturbing Planet beyond, which has been shown by
 subsequent observation to have been only an approximation to the truth.

    Even in this most exact of Sciences, therefore, wo cannot proceed a step,
 without translating the actual Phenomena of Natiire into Intellectual Eepre-

 scntations of those phenomena ; and it is because the Newtonian conception
 is not only the most simple, but is also, up to the extent of our present

 knowledge, universal in its conformity to the facts of observation, that we

 accept it as the only Scheme of the Universe yet promulgated, which satisfies

 our Intellectual requirements.

     When, under the reign of the Ptolemaic System, any new inequality was
 discovered in the motion of a Planet, a new wheel had to be added to the

--ideal Mechanism, as Ptolemy said, " to save appearances." If it should

 prove, a century hence, that the motion of Neptune himself is disturbed

 liy some other attraction than that exerted by the interior Planets, we

  should confidently expect that not an ideal but a real cause for that dis-

 turbance will be found in the existence of another Planet beyond. But

IxxiV                         --RKPORT 1873.

I trust that I have now made it evident to you, that this confident expectation

is not justified by any absolute necessity of Nature, but arises entirely out
of our belief in her TJinformity ; and into the grounds of this and other

Primary Beliefs, Avhich serve as the foundation of all Scientific reasoning, wo

shall presently inquire.

   There is another class of cases, in which an equal certainty is generally
claimed for conclusions that seem to flow immediately from observed facts,
though really evolved by Intellectual processes ; the apparent simplicity and
directness of those processes either causing them to be entirely overlooked,

--or veiling the assumptions on which they are based. Thus Mr. Lockyer

speaks as confidently of the Sun's Chromosphere of incandescent Hydro-
gen, and of the local outbursts which cause it to send forth projections tens
of thousands of miles high, as if he had been able to capture a flask of this
gas, and had generated water by causing it to unite with oxygen. Yet this
confidence is entirely based on the assumption, that a certain line which is seen
in the Spectrum of a hydrogen flame, means hydrogen also when seen in the
spectrum of the Sun's chromosphere ; and higb as is the probability of that
assumption, it cannot be regarded as a demonstrated certainty, since it is by

--no means inconceivable that the same line might bo produced by some other

substance at present unknown. And so when Dr. Huggins deduces from

the different relative positions of certain lines in the spectra of different Stars,

that these Stars are moving from or towards us in space, his admirable train of
reasoning is based on the assumption that these lines have the same meaninr/

-- --that is, that they represent the same elements in every luminary. That

assumption, like the preceding, may be regarded as possessing a sufficiently

high probability to justify the reasoning based upon it ; more especially
since, by the other researches of that excellent observer, the same Chemical
elements have been detected as vapours in those filmy cloudlets which seem
to be stars in an eai4y stage of consolidation. But when Frankland and

Lockyer, seeing in the spectrum of the yellow Solar prominences a certain

bright line not identifiable with that of any known Terrestrial flame, attri-
bute this to a hypothetical new substance which they propose to call Helium,

it  is  obvious  that  their  assumption  rests  on  a  far  less  secure  foundation
                                                                                                                      ;

until it shall have received that verification, which, in the case of Mr.

Crookes's researches on Thallium, was afforded by the actual discovery of the

new metal, whose presence had been indicated to him by a line in the

Spectrum not attributable to any substance then known.

    In a large number of other cases, moreover, our Scientific interpretations

are clearly matters oi judr/ment ; and this is eminently a personal act, the
value of its results depending in each case upon the qualifications of the
individual for arriving at a correct decision. The surest of such judgments

are those dictated by what we term " Common Sense," as to matters on

which there seems no room for difference of opinion, because every sane

person comes to the same conclusion, although he may be able to give no
other reason for it than that it appears to him " self-evident." Thus while

Philosophers have raised a thick cloud of dust in the discussion of the basis

--of our belief in the existence of a World external to ourselves, of the Non
--Ego, as distinct from the Ego, and while every Logician claims to have

--found some flaw in the jDroof advanced by every other, -the Common Sense of

Mankind has arrived at a decision that is practically worth all the arguments

of all the Philosophers who have fought again and again over this battle-
ground. And I think it can be shown that the trustworthiness of this
Common Sense decision arises from its dependence, not on any one set of
                       ADDRESS.                                        IXXV

--Experiences, but upon oui' -unconscious co-ordination of the luhole ac/grerjate

of oitr Experiences, not on the conclusiveness of any one train of Keasoning,
but on the convergence of all our lines of thought towards this one centre.

   Now this " Common Sense," disciphned and enlarged by appropriate culture,

becomes one of our most valuable instruments of Scientific inquiiy ; affording

in many instances the best, and sometimes the only, basis for a rational con-

clusion. Let us take as a typical case, in which no special knowledge is

required, what we are accustomed to call the " flint implements " of the
Abbeville and Amiens gravel-beds. No logical proof can be adduced that

the peculiar shapes of these flints were given to them by Human hands ; but

does any unprejudiced person now doubt it ? The evidence of design, to
which, after an examination of one or two such specimens, we should only

be justified in attaching a probable value, derives an irresistible cogency

from accumulation. On the other hand, the rwiprobability that these flints

acquired their peculiar shape by accident, becomes to our minds greater

and greater as more and more such specimens are found ; until at last this

hypothesis, although it cannot be directly disproved, is felt to be almost in-
conceivable, except by minds previously " possessed " by the " dominant idea "

of the modern origin of Man. And thus what was in the first instance a

matter of discussion, has now become one of those " self-evident " propositions,

which claim the unhesitating assent of all whose opinion on the subject is

entitled to the least weight.

  We proceed upwards, however, from such questions as the Common Sense

of Mankind generally is competent to decide, to those in which special know-

ledge is required to give value to the judgment ; and thus the interpretation

of Nature by the  use  of that faculty  comes  to  be  more  and more  individual
                                                                                                                 ;

things being perfectly " self-evident " to men of special culture, which ordi-

nary men, or men whose training has lain in a different direction, do not
apprehend as such. Of all departments of Science, Geology seems to me to
be the one that most depends on this specially-trained "Common Sense;"

--which brings as it were into one focus the light afforded by a great

variety of studies, Physical and Chemical, Geographical and Biological;

and throws it on the pages of that Great Stone Book, on which the past

history of our Globe is recorded. And whilst Astronomy is of all Sciences
that which may be considered as most nearly representing Nature as she

really is. Geology is that which most completely represents her as seen
through the medium of the interpreting mind ; the meaning of the phenomena

that constitute its data being in almost every instance open to question,

and the judgments passed upon the same facts being often different according

to the qualifications of the several judges. No one who has even a general

acquaintance with the history of this department of Science, can fail to see

that the Geology of each epoch has been the reflection of the Minds by which

its study was then directed ; and that its true progress dates from the time

when that " Common Sense " method of interpretation came to be generally

adopted, which consists in seeking the explanation of past changes in the

Forces at present in operation, instead of invoking the aid of extraordinary

and mysterious agencies, as the older Geologists were wont to do, whenever

-- --they wanted like the Ptolemaic Astronomers " to save appearances." The

whole tendency of the ever-widening range of modern Geological inquiry

has been to show how little reliance can be placed upon the so-called
" Laws " of Stratigraphical and Palseontological Succession, and how much

allowance has to be made for local conditions. So that while the Astro-

nomer is constantly enabled to point to the fulfilment of his predictions as an.
Ixxvi  --REPOET 1873.

 evidence of the correctness of his. method, the Geologist is abnost entirely
 destitute of any such means of verification. For the value of any prediction

--that he may hazard as in regard to the existence or non-existence of Coal

 in any given area,-- depends not only upon the truth of the general doctrines
 of Geology in regard to the succession of Stratified Deposits, but still more

 upon the detailed knowledge which he may have acquired of the distribution

 of those Deposits in the particular locality. Hence no reasonably-judging

 man would discredit either the general doctrines or the methods of Geology,
 because the prediction proves untrue in such a case as that now about to

 be brought in this neighbourhood to the trial of experience.
     AVe have thus considered Man's function as the Scientific Interpreter of

 Nature in two departments of ISTatural Knowledge ; one of which affords an

 example of the strictest, and the other of the freest method, which Man can
 employ in constructing his Intellectual representation of the Universe. And as

 it woiild be found that in the study of all other departments the same methods

 are used, either separately or in combination, we may pass at once to an-

 other part of our inquiry.

    The whole fabric of Geometry rests upon certain Axioms which every one
 accepts as true, but of which it is necessary that the truth should be assumed,

 because they are incapable of demonstration. So, too, the deliverances of our

" Common Sense " derive their trustworthiness from what we consider the

 " self-evidence " of the propositions affirmed. There are, then, certain
 Primary Beliefs, which constitute the groundwork of all Scientific reasoning

and we have next to inquire into their origin.

     This inquiry brings us face to face with one of the great Philosophical
problems of our day, which has been discussed by Logicians and Meta-

 physicians of the very highest ability as Leaders of opposing Schools, with

the one result of showing how much can be said on each side. Ey the

Intuitionalists it is asserted that the tendency to form these Primary Beliefs
is inborn in Man, an original part of his mental organization ; so that they
grow up spontaneously in his Mind as its faculties are gradually unfolded
and developed, requiring no other Experience for their genesis, than that
which sufiices to call these faculties into exercise. But by the advocates of
the doctrine which regards Experience as the basis of all our knowledge,
it is maintained that the Primary Beliefs of each individual are nothing else
than generalizations which he forms of such experiences as he has either
himself acquired or has consciously learned from others ; and they deny
that there is any original or intuitive tendency to the formation of such
beliefs, beyond that which consists in the power of retaining and generalizing

experiences.

    I have not introduced this subject with any idea of placing before you
even a summary of the ingenious arguments by which these opposing
doctrines have been respectively suj^ported ; nor should I have touched on
the question at all, if I did not believe that a means of reconcilement between
them can be found in the idea, that the Intellectual Intuitions of any one

Generation are the cmhoclied Eiyerienccs of the previous Bace. For, as it
appears to me, there has been a progressive improvement in the Thinling

Power of Man ; every product of the culture which has preceded serving to

prepare the soil for yet more abundant harvests in the future.

   Now, as there can be no doubt of the Hereditary transmission in Man of

acquired constitutional peculiarities, which manifest themselves alike in
tendencies to Bodily and to Mental disease, so it seems equally certain that

acquired mental habitudes often impress themselves on his organization, with
ADDRESS,  Ixxvii

sufficient force and permanence to occasion their transmission to the offspring

as tendencies to similar modes of thourjld. And thus, while all admit that

Knowleclje cannot thus descend from one generation to another, an increased
aptitude for the acquirement, either of knowledge generally, or of some par-

ticular kind of it, may be thus inherited. These tendencies and aptitudes
will acquire additional strength, expansion, and permanence, in each new

generation, from their habitual exercise upon the materials supplied by a con-
tinually enlarged experience ; and thus the acquired habitudes produced by
the Intellectual culture of ages, wiU become " a second nature " to every one

who inherits them *.

  We have an illustration of this progress in the fact of continual occurrence,

that conceptions which prove inadmissible to the minds of one generation, in

consequence either of their want of intellectual power to apprehend them, or

of their preoccupation by older habits of thought, subsequently find a uni-
versal acceptance, and even come to be approved as " self-evident." Thus the

First Law of Motion, divined by the genius of Newton, though opposed by
many Philosophers of his time as contrary to all experience, is now accepted
by common consent, not merely as a legitimate inference from Experiment,

but as the expression of a necessary and universal truth; and the same
Axiomatic value is extended to the still more general doctrine, that Energy
of any kind, whether manifested in the " molar " motion of masses, or con-
sisting in the " molecular " motion of atoms, must continue under some

form or other without abatement or decay; what aU admit in regard to

the indestructibility of Matter, being accepted as no less true of Force, namely,

that as ex nihilo nil Jit, so nil Jit ad nihilumf.

   But, it may be urged, the very conception of these and similar great truths
is in itself a typical example of Intuition. The men who divined and enun-
ciated them stand out above their fellows, as possessed of a Genius which

could not only combine but create, of an Insight which could clearly discern

what Eeason could but dimly shadow forth. Granting this freely, I think

it may be shown that the Intuitions of individual Genius are but specially

exalted forms of endowments which are the general property of the Race at

the time, and which have come to be so in virtue of its whole previous culture.

"Who, for example, could refuse to the marvellous aptitude for perceiving the

relations of Numbers, which displayed itself in the untutored boyhood of

George Bidder and Zerah Colburn, the title of an Intuitive gift? But who,

on the other hand, can believe that a Bidder or a Colburn could suddenly

    * This doctrine was first explicitly put fortli by Mr. Herbert Spencer; in whose

Philosophical Treatises it will be found most ably developed. I am glad to be able to

append the following extract from a letter which Mr. Jolni Mill, the great Master of the

Experiential School, was good enough to write to me a few months since, with reference

--to the attempt I had made to place "Common Sense" upon this basis (Contemporary

Review, Feb. 1872) : " When states of mind in no respect innate or instinctive have been

* frequently repeated, the mind acquires, as is proved by tlie power of Habit, a greatly
" increased facility of passing into those states ; and this increased facility must be owing
" to some change of a physical character in the organic action of the Brain. There is also
" considerable evidence that such acquired facilities of passing into certain modes of

" subject now fairly before the scientific world ; and we shall doubtless in time know much

" more about them than we do now. But so far as my imperfect knowledge of the subject
" qualifies me to have an opinion, I take much the same view of it that you do, at least

 " in principle."

    + This is the form in which the doctrine now known as that of the " Conservation of
Energy " was enunciated by Dr. Mayer, in the very remarkable Essay published by liim in
1845, entitled " Die organische Bewegung in ihrem Zusammenhange mit dem Stoffwechsel."

arise in a race of Savages wlio cannot count beyond five ? Or, again, in the

history of the very earliest years of Mozart, who can fail to recognize the

dawji of that glorious Genius, whose brilliant but brief career left its im-

perishable impress on the Art it enriched ? But who would be bold enough

to affirm that an infant Mozart could be born amongst a tribe, whose only

musical instrument is a tom-tom, whose only song is a monotonous chant ?

 --Again, by tracing the gradual genesis of some of those Ideas which we now

accept as "self-evident," such, for example, as that of the " Uniformity of

--Nature " we are able to recognize them as the expressions of certain Intel-

lectual tendencies, which have progressively augmented in force in successive

generations, and now manifest themselves as acquired Mental Instincts that

penetrate and direct our ordinary course of Thought. Such Instincts constitute

a precious heritage, which has been transmitted to us with ever-increasing

value through the long succession of preceding generations ; and which it is

for us to transmit to those who shall come after i;s, with all that further in-

crease which our higher Culture and wider range of Knowledge can impart.

And now, having studied the working action of the Human Intellect in

the Scientific Interpretation of Nature, we shall examine the general character

of its products ; and the first of these with which we shall deal is our con-

ception of Hatter and of its relation to Force.

The Psychologist of the present day views Matter entirely through the

light of his own Consciousness : his idea of Matter in the abstract being that

it is a " something " which has a permanent power of exciting Sensations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

his idea of any " property " of Matter being the mental representation of

some kind of sensory impression he has received from it; and his idea

of any particular kind of Matter being the representation of the whole

aggregate of the Sense-perceptions which its presence has called up in his

Mind. Thus when I press my hand against this table, I recognize its
unyieldingness through the conjoint medium of my sense of Touch, my
Muscidar sense, and my Mental sense of EiFort, to which it wiU be convenient

to give the general designation of the Tactile Sense ; and I attribute to that

mytable a hardness which resists the efi'ort I make to press  hand into its

substance, whilst I also recognize the fact that the force I have employed ia

not sufficient to move its mass. But I press my hand against a lump of

mydough
                                ;
         and  finding  that  its  substance  yields  under  pressure, I call it

soft. Or again, I press my hand against this desk ; and I find that although

I do not thereby change its form, I change its pZace ; and so I get the Tactile

idea of Motion. Again, by the impressions received through the same

Sensorial apparatus, when I lift this book in my hand, I am led to attach to

it the notion of weight or ponderosity ; and by lifting diflerent solids of about

the same size, I am enabled, by the different degrees of exertion I find

myself obliged to make in order to sustain them, to distinguish some of them

as ligJif, and others as heavy. Through the medium of another set of Sense-

perceptions which some regard as belonging to a different category, we dis-

tinguish between bodies that feel " hot " and those that feel " cold ; " and in

this manner we arrive at the notion of differences of Temperature. And

it is through the medium of our Tactile Sense, without any aid from Visionj
that we first gain the idea of solid form, or the Three Dimensions of Space.

Again, by the extension of our Tactile experiences, we acquire the notion

of liquids, as forms of matter yielding readily to pressure, but possessing a,

Bensible weight which may equal that of solids : and of air, whose resisting
power is much slighter, and whose weight is so small that it can only be

made sensible by artificial means. Thus, then, we arrive at the notions of
ADDRESS.  Ixxix

resistance and of weight as properties common to all forms of Matter ; and
now that we have got rid of that idea of Light and Heat, Electricity and

Magnetism, as " imponderable fluids," which used to vex our souls in our
Scientific Childhood, and of which the popular term " Electric fluid " is a

" survival," we accept these properties as affording the practical distinction

between the "material" and the "immaterial."
    Turning, now, to that other great portal of Sensation, the Sight, through

which we receive most of the messages sent to us from the Universe around,
we recognize the same truth. Thus it is agreed alike by Physicists and

Physiologists, that Colour docs not exist as such in the object itself; which
has merely the power of reflecting or transmitting a certain number of
millions of undulations in a second; and these only produce that affection

of our consciousness which we call Colour, when they fall upon the retina of
the living Percipient. And if there be that defect either in the retina or in
the apparatus behind it, which we call " colour-blindness " or Daltonism,
some particular hues cannot be distinguished, or there may even be no power
of distinguishing any colour whatever. If we were all like Dalton, we should

see no difference, except in form, between ripe cherries hanging on a tree,

and the green leaves around them : if we were all affected with the severest
form of colour-blindness, the fair face of Nature would be seen by us as in

the chiaroscuro of an Engraving of one of Turner's Landscapes, not as in the

glowing hues of the wondrous Picture itself. And in regard to our Visual
conceptions it may be stated with perfect certainty, as the result of very
numerous observations made upon persons who have acquired sight for the

first time, that these do not serve for the recognition even of those objects
with which the individual had become most familiar through the Touch,
until the two sets of Sense-perceptions have been co-ordinated by expeiience*.

   When once this co-ordination has been effected, however, the composite
perception of Form which we derive from the Yisnal sense alone is so
complete, that we seldom require to fall back xipon the Touch for any further

--information respecting that quality of the object. So, again, while it is

from the co-ordination of the two dissimilar pictui'es formed by any solid
or projecting object upon our two retinae, that (as Sir Charles Wheat-

stone's admirable investigations have shown) we ordinarily derive through

the Sight alone a correct notion of its solid form, there is adequate evidence

that this notion, also, is a mental judgment based on the experience we have

acquired in early infancy by the consentaneous exercise of the Visual and

Tactile senses.

    Take, again, the case of those wonderful instruments by which our Visual
range is extended almost into the infinity of Space, or into the infinity of
 Minuteness. It is the mental not the bodily eye, that takes cognizance of

what the Telescope and the Microscope reveal to us. For we should have
no well-grounded confidence in their revelations as to the %ml:nou'n, if we

had not first acquired experience in distinguishing the true from the false
by applying them to Icnown objects ; and every interpretation of what we see
through theii* instrumentality is a mental judgment as to the probable form,

size, and^ movement of bodies removed by either their distance or their mi-
nuteness from being cognosced by our Tactile Sense.

   The case is still stronger in regard to that last addition to our Scientific

armamentum, vvhich promises to be not inferior in value either to the Telescope

or the Microscope ; for it may be truly said of the Spectroscope, that it has
not merely extended the range of our Vision, but has almost given us a new
sense, by enabling us to recognize distinctive properties in the Chemical
Elements which were previously quite unknown. And who shall now say
that we know all that is to be known as to any form of Matter ; or that the
Science of the fourth quarter of this century may not furnish us with as

great an enlargement of our knowledge of its Properties, and of our power of
recognizing them, as that of its third has done ?

   But, it may be said, is not this view of the Material Universe open to the

--imputation that it is " evolved out of the depths of our own consciousness"
--projection of our own Intellect into what surrounds us an ideal rather than

a real World ? If all we know of Matter be an " Intellectual Conception," how

--are we to distinguish this from such as we form in our Dreams ? for these,

as our Laureate no less happily than philosophically expresses it, are " true

while they last." Here our "Common Sense" comes to the rescue. We

" awake, and behold it was a dream." Every healthy mind is conscious of the

difference between its waking and its dreaming experiences ; nowor, if it is

and then puzzled to answer the question " Did this really happen, or did I
dream it? " the perplexity arises from the consciousness that it might have

happened. And every healthy mind, finding its own experiences of its waking

state not only self-consistent, but consistent with the experiences of others,

accepts them as the basis of its beliefs, in preference to even the most vivid

recollections of its dreams.

   The Lunatic Pauper who regards himself as a King, the Asylum in which he

is confined as a Palace of regal splendour, and his Keepers as obsequious at-
tendants, is so " possessed " by the conception framed by his disordered in-

tellect, that he does project it out of himself into his surroundings ; his refusal

to admit the corrective teaching of Common Sense being the very essence of his
malady. And there are not a few persons abroad in the world, who equally
resist the teachings of Educated Common Sense, whenever they run counter to

--their own preconceptions ; and who may be regarded as in so far^affected

with what I once heard Mr. Carlyle pithily characterize as a " diluted In-

 eanity."

   It has been asserted, over and over again, of late years, by a class of men
who claim to be the only true Interpreters of Nature, that we know nothing
but Matter and the Laws of Matter, and that Force is a mere fiction of the
Imagination. May it not be affirmed, on the other hand, that while our
notion of Matter is a Conception of the Intellect, Force is that of which we

-- --have the most direct perhaps even the onhj dh-ect cognizance? As I have

already shown you, the knowledge of Ilesistauce and of Weight which we gain
 through our Tactile Sense is derived from our own perception of exertion ; and

in Vision, as in Hearing, it is the Force with which the undulations strike

 the sensitive surface, that affects our consciousness with Sights or Sounds.

 True it is that in our Visual and Auditory Sensations, we do not, as in oi;r
 Tactile, directly cognosce the Force which produces them ; but the Physicist

 has no difficulty in making sensible to us indirectly the undulations by Avhich

 Sound is propagated, and in proving to our Intellect that the Force conaemed

 in the transmission of Light is really enormous*.

                                                             ADDRESS.                                    Ixxxi

It seems strange that those who make the loudest appeal to Experience as

the basis of all knowledge, should thus disregard the most constant, the most

fundamental, the most direct of all experiences ; as to which the Common

Sense of Mankind affords a guiding light much clearer than any that can be

seen through the dust of Philosopliical discussion. For, as Sir John Herschel

most truly remarked, the universal Consciousness of mankind is as much in

accord in regard to the existence of a real and intimate connexion between

Cause and Effect, as it is in regard to the existence of an External World ; and

tha,t consciousness arises to every one out of his own sense of personal ex-

ertion in the origination of changes by his individual agency.

   Now while fully accepting tlie Logical definition of Cause as the " an-

tecedent or concurrence of antecedents on which the Effect is invariably and

unconditionally consequent," we can always single out one dynamical

-- --antecedent the Power which does the work from the aggregate of

material conditions under which that Power may be distributed and

applied. No doubt the term Cause is very loosely employed in popular

--phraseology; often (as Mr. Mill has shown) to designate the occurrence that

immediately preceded the effect ; as when it is said that the spark which

falls into a barrel of gunpowder is the cause of its explosion, or that the

slipping of a man's foot off the rung of a ladder is the cause of his fall.

But even a very slightly trained Intelligence can distinguish the Power

which acts in each case, fi-om the Conditions under which it acts. The

Eorce which produces the explosion is locked up (as it were) in the powder
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and ignition merely liberates it, by bringing about new Chemical combina-

tions. The faU of the man from the ladder is due to the Gravity which was

equally piilling him down while he rested on it ; and the loss of support,

either by the slipping of his foot, or by the breaking of the rung, is merely

that change in the material conditions which gives the Power a new action.
   Many of you have doubtless viewed with admiring interest that truly won-

derful work of Human Design, the Walter Printing Machine. You first

examine  it  at rest                              presently  comes  a  man  who  simply puUs  a  handle  towards
                                               ;
him

   --;
and the whole                                     inert  mechanism becomes       instinct with   life,   the con-

tinuous sheet of four miles of blank paper which rolls off the cylinder at one

end, being delivered at the other, without any intermediate human agency, as

separate " Times " Newspapers, at the rate of 15,000 an hour. Now what is

the Cause of this most marvellous effect ? Siu-ely it lies essentially in the

Power or Eorce which the pulling of the handle brought to bear on the machine

--from some extraneous source of Power, which we in this instance know to

be a_ Steam-engine on the other side of the wall. This Eorce it is, which,

distributed through the various parts of the Mechanism, really performs the

action of which each is the instrument ; they only supply the vehicle for its

transmission and application. The man comes again, pushes the handle in the

opposite direction, detaches the Machine from the Steam-engine, and the

whole comes to a stand ; and so it remains, like an inanimate corpse, until

recalled to activity by the renewal of its Moving Power.

But, say the Reasoners who deny that Force is any thing else than a fiction

of the imagination, the revolving shaft of the Steam-engine is " Matter in

Motion;" and when the connexion is established between that shaft and the

one that drives the Machine, the Motion is communicated from the former to

the latter, and thence distributed to the several parts of the Mechanism.

This account of the operation is just what an observer might give, who had

lookcd-on with entire ignorance of every thing but what his eijes could see ;

the moment he puts his hand upon any part of the machinery, and tries to

stop its motion, he takes as direct cognizance, through hia feeling of the Effort

required to resist it, of the force which produces that motion, as he does

through his eye of the motion itself.

   Now since it is universally admitted that our notion of the External World

would be not only incomplete, but erroneous, if our Visual perceptions were

not supplemejited by our Tactile, so, as it seems to me, our interpretation of

the Phenomena of the Universe must be very inadequate, if we do not

mentally co-ordinate the idea of Force with that of Motion, and recognize it

--as the " efficient cause " of those phenomena, the " material conditions "

constituting (to use the old Scholastic term) only " their formal cause."

And I lay the greater stress on this point, because the Mechanical Phi-

losophy of the present day tends more and more to express itself in terms
--of Motion rather than in terms of Force
                                                                                                                                                          ;to become Kinetics instead of Dy-

namics.

 --Thus from whatever side we look at this question, whether the Common

Sense of Mankind, the Logical Analysis of the relation between Cause and

Effect, or the Study of the working of our own Intellects in the interpreta-

--tion of Nature, we seem led to the same conclusion ; that the notion of Force

is one of those elementary Forms of Thought with which we can no more

dispense, than we can with the notion of Space or of Succession. And I

shaU now, in the last place, endeavour to show you that it is the siibsti-

tution of the Dynamical for the mere Phenomenal idea, which gives their

highest value to our conceptions of that Order of Nature, which is wor-

shipped as itself a God by the class of Interpreters whose doctrine I call

in question.

The most illustrative as well as the most illustrious example of the differ-

ence between the mere Generalization of Phenomena and the Dynamical

conception that applies to them, is furnished by the contrast between the

so-called Laws of Planetary Motion discovered by the persevering ingenuity

of Kepler, and the interpretation of that Motion given us by the profound in-

sight of Newton. Kepler's three Laws were nothing more than comprehen-

sive statements of certain groups of Phenomena determined by observation.

Thejirst, that of the revolution of the Planets in EUiptical orbits, was based

on the study of the observed places of Mars alone                                                                                                                                                                                                              it might or might not be
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

true of the other Planets ; for, so far as Kepler knew, there was no reason

why the orbits of some of them might not be the excentric circles which he had

first supposed that of Mars to be. So Kepler's second law of the passage of

the Eadius Vector over equal areas in equal times, so long as it was simply

a generalization of facts in the case of that one Planet, carried with it no

reason for its applicability to other cases, except that which it might derive

from his erroneous conception of a whirling force. And his third law was

in like manner simply an expression of a certain Harmonic relation which

he had discovered between the times and the distances of the Planets, having

no more rational value than any other of his numerous hypotheses.

   Now the Newtonian " Laws " are often spoken of as if they were merely

higher gewralizations in which Kepler's are included ; to me they seem to

possess an altogether different character. For starting with the Conception

of two Forces, one of them tending to produce continiious uniform motion in

a straight line, the other tending to produce a uniformly accelerated motion

towards a fixed point, Newton's wonderful mastery of Geometrical reasoning

enabled him to show that, if these Dynamical assumptions be granted,

Kepler's p/ienomena^ "Laws," being necessary consequences of them, must

be universally true. And while that demonstration would have been alone

Bufflcient to give him an imperishable renown, it was his still greater glory

--to divine that the fall of the Moon towards the Earth that is, the deflection

of her path from a tangential line to an ellipse is a phenomenon of the same
order as the fall of a stone to the ground ; and thus to show the applicability

to the entire Universe, of those simple Dynamical conceptions which consti-

tute the basis of the Geometry of the Principia.

   Thus, then, whilst no " Law " which is simply a generalization of
Phenomena can be considered as having any coercive action, we may assign

that value to Laws which express the universal conditions of the action of a
i^orce whose existence we learn from the testimony of our own consciousness.

The assurance we feel that the Attraction of Gravitation miist act under all

circumstances according to those simple Laws which arise immediately out of

our Dynamical conception of it, is of a veiy diiferent order from that which

we have in regard (for example) to the Laws of Chemical Attraction, which
are as yet only generalizations of phenomena. And yet even in that strong

assurance, we are required by our examination of the basis on which it rests,
to admit a reserve of the possibility of something different ; a reserve which we

may well believe that Newton himself must have entertained.

  A most valuable lesson as to the allowance we ought always to make for

the unknown " possibilities of Nature," is taught us by an exceptional phe-

nomenon so familiar that it does not attract the notice it has a right to

claim. Next to the Law of the Universal Attraction of Masses of Matter,

there is none that seems to have a wider range than that of the Expansion of

Bodies hj Heat and their Contraction by Cold. Excluding Water and one or

two  other substances, the  fact  of such  expansion might be said to  be  invariable
                                                                                                                  ;

and, as regards bodies whose Gaseous condition is known, the Law of Ex-

pansion can be stated in a form no less simple and definite than the Law of

Gravitation. Supposing those exceptions, then, to be unknown, the Law

would be universal in its range. But it comes to be discovered that Water,

whilst conforming to it in its expansion from 39|° xipivards to its boiling-

point, as also, when it passes into Steam, to the special law of Expansion of

Vapours, is exceptional in expanding also from 39|° doivnwards to its Freez-

ing-point ; and of this failure in the Universality of the Law, no rationale can
be given. StiU more strange is it, that by dissolving a little scdt in water,

we should remove this exceptional peculiarity ; for sea-water continues to con-

tract from 39|° downwards to its Freezing-point 12° or 14° lower, just as it

does with reduction of temperature at higher ranges.

   Thus from our study of the mode in which we arrive at those conceptions
of the Orderly Sequence observable in the Phenomena of Nature which we

call " Laws," we are led to the conclusion that they are Human conceptions,
subject to Human fallibility; and that they may or may not express the

Ideas of the Great Author of Nature. To set up these Laws as self-acting,

and as either excluding or rendering unnecessary the Power which alone

can give them effect, appears to me as arrogant as it is unphilosophical. To

speak of any Law as "regulating" or "governing" phenomena, is only per-

--missible on the assumption that the Law is the expression of the modus

operandi of a Governing Power. I was once in a great City which for two
days was in the hands of a lawless mob. Magisterial authority was sus-
pended by timidity and doubt : the force at its command was paralyzed by
want of resolute direction. The " Laws " were on the Statute book, but there

was no Power to enforce them. And so the Powers of evil did their terrible

work; and fire and rapine continued to destroy life and property without

check, until uew Power came in, when the Ileigu of Law was restored.
Ixxxiv  --REPORT 1872.

  --And thus we are led to the culminating point of Man's Intellectual Inter-

pretation of Nature, his recognition of the Unity of the Power, of which her
Phenomena are the diversified manifestations. Towards this point all Scien-

tific inquiry now tends. The Convertibility of the Physical Porces, the Cor-

relation of these with the Vital, and the intimacy of that nexus between

Mental and Bodily activity, which, explain it as we may, cannot be denied,
all lead upward towards one and the same conclusion ; and the pyramid of

which that Philosophical conclusion is the apex, has its foundation in the

Primitive Instincts of Humanity.

   By our own remote Progenitors, as by the untutored Savage of the present
day, every change in which Human agency is not apparent was referred to
a particular Animating Intelligence. And thus they attributed not only the

movements of the Heavenly bodies, but all the phenomena of Nature, each

to its own Deity. These Deities were invested with more than Human power
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

but they were also supposed capable of Human passions, and subject to
Human capriciousness. As the Uniformities of Nature came to be more

distinctly recognized, some of these Deities were invested with a domi-
nant control, while others were supposed to be tlieir subordinate ministers.

A serene Majesty was attributed to the greater Gods who sit above the

clouds ; whilst their inferiors might " come down to Earth in the likeness of
Men." With the growth of the Scientific Study of Nature, the conception
of its Harmony and Unity gained ever-increasing strength. And so among
the most enlightened of the Greek and Eoman Philosophers, we find a

distinct recognition of the idea of the Unity of the Directing Mind from
which the Order of Nature proceeds ; for they obviously believed that, as our
modern Poet has expressed it,

                                  " All are but parts of one stupendous whole,

                            " Whose body Nature is, and God the Soul."

   The Science of Modern times, however, has taken a more special direction.
Pixing its attention exclusively on the Order of Nature, it has separated itself
wholly from Theology, whose function it is to seek after its Cause. In this.
Science is fuUy justified, alike by the entire independence of its objects, and by
the historical fact that it has been continually hampered and impeded in its
search for the Truth as it is in Nature, by the restraints which Theologians
have attempted to impose upon its inquiries. But when Science, passing
beyond its own limits, assumes to take the place of Theology, and sets up its
own conception of the Order of Nature as a sufficient account of its Cause,
it is invading a province of Thought to which it has no claim, and not un-
reasonably provokes the hostility of those who ought to be its best friends.

   For whilst the deep-seated instincts of Humanity, and the profoundcst re-
searches of Philosophy, alike point to Mind as the one and only source of
Power, it is the high prerogative of Science to demonstrate the Unifi/ of the
Power which is operating through the limitless extent and variety of the
Universe, and to trace its Continuity through the vast series of Ages that
have been occupied in its Evolution.

Ueport OH the Gaussian Constants for the year 1829, or a Theory of

   Terrestrial Magnetism founded on all available observations. By

   H, Petersen and A. Erman.

It was in 1838 that the illustrious C. F. Gauss published the principles of

a method which made all the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism as fully

calculable as are astronomical phenomena by Newton's theory of gravita-

--tion. This beautiful accession to natural philosoi^hy may be summed tip as

follows:

For every point of space, the position of which is given by its distance r from

the earth's centre, and by the angles u and X denoting respectively its angular

distance from the geographical north pole and its longitude east from Green-

wich, there exists a mathematical expression relating to the terrestrial magnetic

qualities of this point, and containing only r and trigonometrical functions

of u and X, together with numerical values that are the same for the whole

extent of space. This expression is called the magnetic potential of the

point ; and as to the said numerical values, we give them here, as we did in

the Eeport on our computation made during the years 1846 to 1848, the

name of the Gaussian Constants. This must be iinderstood as relating to

their invariability as to space, but by no means to independence of time.

For every point on the earth's surface, or above it, up to infinite distance,

the magnetic potential has a finite value, and in consequence thereof must be

calculable as soon as the Gaussian constants are known. There exists no

visible or measurable phenomenon which for every given point agrees with

the value of the magnetic potential ; but this remarkable quantity is

for every place in explicit connexion with the intensity and the direction

of the magnetic force which is exerted there by the causes considered. These

two measurable phenomena are therefore given as soon as the potential can

be ascertained; and the same is the case with every one of the components

which we are wont to form of terrestrial magnetism for the sake of easier

--observations as, for instance, with the three rectangular components, which

in their turn are equivalent to the horizontal and vertical intensities and to

1872.                                        B

what we call the augles of declination and inclination. Indeed at any place

a component in any direction whatever of the magnetic force is merely pro-
portional to the increment which the potential there takes by a small

displacement in the same direction. But now the determination of

that potential which outside a sphere results from any magnetic actions
of its interior, and therefore, according to the last remark, the foretelling of
all magnetic phenomena produced by the same causes, become possible and
are facilitated by the following circumstances. In every case of the descrip-
tion just mentioned the mag-netic potential can be expanded into an infinite

but converging series, proceeding by integer powers of -, the exponent of the

                                                                                                   r

first one being -|-1. Among the terms of this series, that which is divided

                         by r contains 3 of the Gaussian constants,
                               r^ 5 »

                                                                                                                              I

                                      2n+l ,,

In the formula for the potential, each of these constants is mtdtiplied by a
theoretically given trigonometrical function of u and X, and therefore, for any
given point, by the numerical equivalent of this function. The algebraic
developments which Gauss's classical work contains far the magnetic potential,
as well as for the observable magnetic components, relate also to the actions
of a sphere enclosing a finite or infinite number of any magnetic centres
whatsoever. Therefore these expressions can represent our terrestrial pheno-
mena only after the substitution, for every symbol denoting a Gaussian con-
stant, of that number which the individual magnetic qualities of the earth
require, according to observations. But then, specially, this transformation of
the abstract theory of the magnetic actions of a sphere into the practical
theory of terrestrial magnetism will amount to the determination, from a

+sufiicient number of observed values, of 15, 24, 35, or generally n'^ 2n

Gaussian constants, according as it appears that the third, the fourth, the

fifth, or generally the nth term in the algebraical expressions of these em-
pirical data is the first that is surpassed by the probable amount of their

inevitable errors.

   A first attempt towards the completion of the theory of terrestrial magnetism

was made by its illustrious author with material of which the gaps for the
greater part of the Antarctic Ocean, and for other vast regions, could only be
filled up by graphical guesswork. It led to the conclusion that a restriction
to four terms of the potential, and therefore the determination of 24 Gaussian
constants, did more than respond to the mean exactitude of the empirical data.
To the same effect was the computation that H. Petersen executed from
1846 to 1848, when commissioned for the purpose by the British Association.
Indeed, it being exclusively founded on 610 results of careful magnetic
measurements made by A. Erman on a line round the earth between
67° north latitude and 60° south latitude, the resulting new constants re-

presented these observed values fully twice as well as did the old ones,

and thereby, as must be avowed, up to the amount of their own probable
errors. But it having been shown by later experience that, just as was

expected, miich larger disagreement between reality and both the theoretical
deductions, did still exist in those parts of the earth where the one or the
ON THE GAUSSIAX CONSTANTS FOR THE YEAR 1829.  3

other had wanted empirical supplemeuting *; and we, in consequence thereof

undertaking the recomputation now iinished with all available observations,

resolved once more to confine ourselves to the determination of the same

24 constants solely. Indeed the material on which we have founded this new

and definitive calculation is by its geographical completeness far superior

to that of both the former ones; but many of its modern accessions do not

exceed, nor even attain the exactitude of the observations mentioned above.

   According to what we have stated in the beginning, the Gaussian constants
must to the same extent be either dependent on or indexiendent of time as are

the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism. Now very old and indubitable

experience has proved that each of these phenomena undergoes not only
the various short-period changes, from which the observer can easily,
and is always supposed to free them, but also the so-called secular
variations of by far a larger amount. The Gaussian constants being then

likewise variable as to time, it appears that they can be determined each
time but for one given epoch, and then out of observations which either have

been all made at this epoch, or reduced to what they would have given if
made at the same.

   The aim of our present calculations was to determine with all attainable

exactitude the Gaussian constants for the year 1829, in order that the results
of the newly founded theory might be directly comparable as well with those
of their first evaluation, relating nearly to the same epoch, as with the most

careful measurements made by Hansteen and Erman between 1828 and
1830. liut, as for carrying this out we had to make an equal use of all ob-

servations to be relied upon, and originating whether in the selected epoch
or at any interval whatsoever before or after this time, our work was
divided into two independent parts :

       1. Formulse were to be constructed and employed for reducing each of the
               magnetic results which, at widely differing times, had been ob-
              tained by observations all over the earth's surface, to what they
               would have been in 1829 ; and

       2. Out of these reduced values, twenty-four numbers were to be com-
             puted which, when taken for our twenty-four Gaussian constants,
                responded as nearly as possible to all empirical data observed in,
                or reduced to, the e])och 1829.

                    I. Reduction of Ohserved Values to the Year 1829.

   Without the existence of the Gaussian theory, the only means to execute
such reductions would have been, for every kind of magnetic phenomena
at any place, to gaess what changes they had undergone, according to
the changes which had been observed for the same phenomena at certain
other places. Such rude attempts have indeed been made for the purpose of
ascertaining the changes of declination at places where they had never been

observed. They could perhaps have been extended, though with much less

foundation on experience, to inclination-changes ; whereas for the secular
variations of intensity not even this appearance of a means existed, owing

to an almost total want of data. But the problem of our reductions has now

 been stated in proper form and has been greatly simplified, since theory has
 shown tliat, and how, all kinds of magnetic secular changes, for any arbitrary

 time and place, depend on one common cause, viz. on the synchronous changes

 of the Gaussian constants. Indeed these quantities only can give to the alge-
 braic expressions of magnetic elements different numerical values at various
 epochs, because the quantities r, u, and \ are by their nature once and for
 ever invariable ; and then, as only the first power of every Gaussian constant,

--and no products of them, occurs in the potential, the following general rule can

 evidently be laid down : The amount of change for any element of terrestrial
 magnetism (as, for instance, for the declination, the inclination, one of the
 three rectangular components, and so forth) during a given period must be
 calculated by that same formula which expresses its absolute value, if only
 instead of each Gaussian constant there is placed the increment which its
 value has received during the same period. This plain corollary of the magnetic
 theory has been of twofold use for the reductions we had to make, and will
 serve in the same way for all future ones. Indeed its inverse application
 gives, from observed changes of magnetic phenomena, the synchronous
 changes of the Gaussian constants; and by substituting these latter results in
 the direct formulfe, the changes of every phenomenon may be computed for
 places where they have never been observed. The first part of this pro-
 ceeding is immensely preferable to empirical guessings ; for it makes an almost
 equal use of the variations in any kind of magnetic phenomena, and therel)y
 leads to the knowledge of these variations in those kinds for which experience
is wanting. The secular changes of intensity may therefore bo ascertained
for periods in which we know only changes of inclination and declination,
 or even for those in which the latter only have been observed, ^tloreover it
is only by these means that the consequences of experience on secular changes

 in certain parts of the earth can very confidently be extended to the re-

 motest parts.

    Nevertheless, before we could make the application of this memorable
method, a decision was wanted concerning two points, according to the result

 of which our proposed reductions might prove to be either easy or difficult, or
 even wholly impracticable ; to wit :

       1. What kind of connexion exists between llic lapse of time and

               the variations which are undergone by magnetic phenomena and
                consequently by the Gaussian constants ? and
       2. In how many and in Avliich of the Gaussian constants will the varia-

             tions be of most influence, and in which others may they be

                 neglected for practical approximation ?

    As to the first question, it has been proved by the changes of the three
magnetic components at Berlin, observed fuUy during the last forty-five
years by Erman, and partially at intervals during almost a hundred years
by others, and besides by a great number of partial series of observations

at other places, that during the last century the variations of magnetic
phenomena, and consequently those of the Gaussian constants, have never
happened by a leap, but have always progressed according to the law of
continuity, and especially so that their amount has been merely proportional
to the lapse of time and to its square. If, therefore, the increment of one of

these constants from a year denoted by T' to another denoted by T has been

ascertained, the (;pp-^,Jth* of this quantity will be equal to the annual

                                                                                                                                                                      rp . rp:

orer it foUo'ws that, bj^ the knowledge of such anniial increase at two

moments separated from one another by a sufficiently hmg space of time,

we can calcnlate not only its value for any moment, but also that of the

corresponding total increase dnring any period. Therefore the materials we

possessed (as is to be shown hereafter) for computing the annual increments

of the constants for the year 1811 and for the year 1843-5, must suffice for

our reductions ; but before emplojdng them we had to consider the second of
the above-mentioned questions. An indubitable answer to it was, of course,

that we had to take into account and to determine the variation with time

for all those twenty-four constants the values of which were to be deter-

mined afterwards by the reduced observations. The solution of the problem

up to this highest degree of exactitude will at some future time be a beautiful

result of our present work, combined with a similar one for a later date ; but

had we undertaken it now, the preparatory task would not only have become

more extensive than the essential one, but would even have been impeded

Wcby a most sensible want of means.  had therefore to content ourselves with

making our reductions for secular changes an approximation to reality, in

the same way as astronomers do when, in computing secular planetary

perturbations, they disregard the terms of less influence. So in this particular

--case it was resolved to take into consideration only the changes of the first

two terms of the potential that is to say, to ascertain for two epochs tho

annual increments of the first eight of the Gaussian constants.

constants marked by

                                     ^^'\

for our first epoch of 1811, we have founded the computation on :

1. The increments of declination which appear as having happened
       from the year 1784 to the year 1840, from a comparison of the
       maps of isogonic lines constructed for the said years by C. Hansteeu
       and E. Sabine ; and

2. The increments which inclination has undergone from 1780 to 1840
       and which appear as differences between the isoclinal maps of the
       same authors.

   The increments of these two phenomena were taken by comparing the said
maps for forty-two points of intersection between the meridians of

                =X 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°

and the parallels of
                     M=30°, 50°, 70°, 90°, 110°, 130- and 150°;

and then, if t and t respectively designate the fifty-six years' increment of
declination and the sixty years' increment of inclination, and

intended to give these quantities for the date 1843-5. This date follows
indeed from being the middle of the period 1829-58, during which

had happened those changes of phenomena on which we first founded our

conditional or primary equations. These were the values of a or increments

of declination that we obtained by a comparison between the normal or

theoretically interpolated declinations for 1829, as given in the 'Magnetischo
Atlas' by Gauss and Weber, and the corresponding ones for 1858, as re-
presented by the isogonic lines in Berghaus's Chart of the World.

and completeness of the absolute measurements at different places, partly as
follo-ws from some regard to the dates of these performances. Out of the
preceding values of annual increments, only those under 1 and 3 have
been derived immediately and exclusively from observations at the places

named in the same lines; and then, especially if the date is generally

marked by 1800 + 1, the numerical absolute values of magnetic elements are

expressed for Berlin, or with u and X as under 1, according to Ermau's ob-

servations, by

these increments of rectangular components for 1843-5 are obtained as above
under 1 and 3.

   But for all the other above-named places, the existing observations, when

treated as the last mentioned, did not give complete expressions for d, i, and w,
but only their expressions for limited periods. The annual increments of the
components X, Y, Z, which were determined from such observations, in
general did not exactly pertain to 1843-5, but to a value of t somewhat
different from 43-5. Now, as our computation for the first epoch, or 1811,
had already furnished the increments of the constants a,, a^. . . .a^ for the

same, we have, first, calculated (by the help of the following formulae (3),
(4), and (5)) the annual increments of X, Y, Z at the same places for 1811,

and then, having denoted the value of any one of these increments for

                                             1843-5 by S,

an additional regard to this circumstance.

Now, as for the conditional equations themselves, between a^ a, . . . . a, for

.II. Compviatlon of the fwenti/-fonr Gaussian Constants from values

                                ohserved in or reduced to 1829.

The numerous applications which we made of these means of reduction,

not only have added considerably to the number of empirical data for our

intended research, but they have also increased the intrinsic value of the

whole stock of such data. Indeed many observed elements Avhich by their

reduction to the epoch 1829 became api)licable to our purpose, related to

points of extensive regions where all knowledge of magnetic i^henomena had

been hitherto wanting. Such were, for instance, the beautiful series of

magnetic measurements which English navigators have executed in the

antarctic and North-American glacial oceans, and also many magnetic

determinations in the interior of the United States. Therefore the materials

now collected must amply suffice for our purpose ; but it seemed at first sight

as if for its attainment two cntirelj' different ways were left to our option.

Further consideration, however, has convinced us that of these ways or modes

of operating   only                                                     the  one which we     have  adopted was admissible                                                                                                   but this

consideration, together with the doubt which it settled, merits to be shortly

explained here.

   According to a first plan of operation, we had to begin by calculating for

everj' newly added magnetic element its excess n over the theoretic value

--assigned to it by the old approximations for the Gaussian constants then,

having formed for each of these results (with a^, rf,,. . . . w.,^ for given functions

of u and \, and Ar/''' '*, A/t"' ", every v and /i respectively varying from 1 to 4
and from to 4, for the corrections of constants) the expression

to derive from each of these primary equations its correspondhig contributions

to the twenty-four final equations for A(/'", Ac/''                                                               A/i'*''*; and lastly,
                                         --

        ON THE GAUSSIAN CONSTANTS FOR THE YEAR 1829.     17

having added each of these contributions to the similar one among those
equations which H. Petersen has stated to represent all the magnetic elements
measured by Erman in 1829*, we had to solve the so completed expressions

according to the sought-for corrections, A^'", A(/''', AA'"'. . . . AA*'*.

   On the other hand, instead of such indifferent aggregation of all new
material to all the old, we had, according to the second method, to make

a proper abstract of each of the two classes of data, and then to derive the
sought-for values of constants from equations founded only on these abridged

materials.

   But as the most probable determination of the Gaussian constants is
evidently only obtained by observations at points symmetrically situated all
over the earth's surface and being all of equal weight (that is to say, reliable to
an equal extent), the beforementioned method jjroved to be doubly imperfect.
Indeed the material for the said former calculation of H. Petersen consisted in
GlOmagnetic elements, which corresponded to 650 direct observations executed
along a line round the earth of 8100 German miles. The three data for the
magnetic determination of a point, therefore, were to be found all over this
line at an average distance of 37'4 German miles, or of very nearly 2°-5 of
the equator, whereas when those points for which magnetic elements had

now to be added were counted in their succession on parallels of latitude or
on any other lines round the earth, there appeared everywhere a much

scantier distribution, which on an average did not exceed a sixth or a seventh

of what it was for the former calculation. On immediate addition of the
former suras of final equations to the corresponding new sums, the resulting
new values of Gaussian constants would therefore have been influenced to an

exceedingly larger extent by the magnetic character of one almost linear
tract of the earth's surface, than by all its remaining parts. To compensate

such vicious preponderance, we might, before adding the two sums, have
multiplied each of them by a number inversely proportional to the frequency

of its elements. But this proceeding supposed, in order to be right, that all

constituent observations were of equal weight, while in our case we must

own, on the contrary, that the probable errors of the newly added elements
surpassed those of the formerly observed ones in a considerable though rather

indefinite proportion. Indeed by separate comparisons of some of the new
and of the old observations with others of their respective classes, the new

seemed upon the whole in less accordance, partly of course in direct con-
sequence of the manner in which they were made, partly because of their
having been reduced to 1829 by a method which, for all our care, was but
an approximation to reality.

   We have avoided these difficulties by choosing the second of the above-

mentioned modes of operation and by prosecuting it as follows :
    Out of all stations for which the three rectangular magnetic components,

as in 1829, had become known, either by direct observation or by our
reductions for secular changes, we selected those which are nearest to ten
parallels of latitude between i6=23° and zf=165°, and at the same time to
the one or the other of nine equidistant points of every one of these circles.
Having then concluded out of the results for these stations the 270 elements
that belong to the 90 predetermined points, these latter values were ex-
clusively introduced into the like number of our primary equations, which in

* As published in the Eeport of the Eighteenth Meeting of tlie British Association, held

in IS4S, tables facing p. 08, under "Final Equations i'or the corrections of the Gaussian

constants from 610 magnetic elements.''

their turn gave the final equations for the most probable twenty-four values

of Gaussian constants.

   It appears that by so doing we have given to the data of observation,

first, the requisite symmetrical repartition over the earth, and then, secondly,

to all its parts the nearest possible equality of weight. Indeed, when selected

as just said, there followed one another quite casually, on each parallel,
observations that were instituted in 1829 and those which had been

reduced to this year, now from the earlier date of their direct validity,
now from the later one. These data became therefore affected by the stiU

remaining defects of reduction to a different extent and in alternate directions,
just as by those inevitable errors of observation which the usual formation of
final equations supposes to exist in their numerical material.

    But then, lastly, as to the reduction of elements from the spots of direct

observation to the neighbouring predetermined points, we have avoided its pre-

judicial influence by alwaj's using a merely mechanical interpolation, relating

to points which in latitude as well as in longitude differed in alternate

directions from those points to which we were to reduce them.

The following Table contains, according to the hitherto used notation

Z=/of X:=/cosi cosd, Y=/costsinrf, and  sin?', those values of 270 magnetic

elements for 1829 on which our new values of the Gaussian constants have

exclusively been foimded. To these fundamental numbers are added under

AX, AY, and AZ, their respective excesses on the values which a computa-

tion with the old assumed constants assigned to them. These latter numbers

show thus to what extent the hitherto existing theory of terrestrial magnetism

still wanted correction in different paits of the earth's surface.

It is still worth mentioning that, for the determination of our following

normal values of X, T, and Z, we have employed out of the vicinity of the

ON THE GAUSSIAN CONSTANTS FOR THE YEAR 1829.  21
32 REPORT 1872.

   We give now the result of our investigation, viz. the Gaussian constants for

1829, as resulting from all observations that we have found or made avail-

able for the purpose, and thereby forming the best theoretical representation

of terrestrial magnetism which we think can up to the present be effected. The
probable error that is subjoined to each of these numbers shows to what
exteat it may be relied upon; but as these valuations are only founded on
the differences between the values that were assumed for our 270 normal
elements and those which the new constants assign to the same, the mean of
their amount may perhaps be still altered by the more numerous comparisons

of directly observed and newly calculated elements that will soon be instituted
and published.

24 REPORT 'm7ll.

This examination has been conducted, as before, by Mr. George Jenner, lately

the chief executive officer of the island ; and though I am not in a position to
give any thing like a detailed account of the results, I am happy to say that 1

believe they will be found in time to be fully as instructive as those of the

Weformer examination have been.  are now in possession of several parts

of the skeleton of Pezophaps which have hitherto been wanting, and of more

have also additional remains of the large Psittacine bii'd, described from a

single fragmentary maxilla by Prof. Alphonse Milne-Edwards as Psittacus (?)

rodericanm ; and this, I hope, will enable that accomplished palaeontologist
to determine more particularly the affinities of the species, which have

hitherto been doubtful ; and I may add that thus some further light may be

thrown upon the position of the P. mauritiamis of Prof. Owen. In the course

of last year my brother had the pleasure of receiving from Mr. Jenner proof

of the continued existence of one of the species described by Leguat as in-

habiting Rodriguez, but thought to have become extinct. This jjroof con-

sisted of a specimen procured in spirit of an undescribed and very distinct

Palceornis, which T have since described (Ibis, 1872, p. 33) as P. e.vsul.

Among the bones sent by Mr. Jenner are, I believe, some which belonged to

this bird. But more remarkable and interesting still are some remains which

are obviously those of a llalline bird, unquestionably allied to Ocydromus;

and these M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards informs me he is inclined to refer to

the " Gelinotte " mentioned by Leguat, the nature of which has hitherto been

only open to guess. There are also bones of other species of birds, perhaps

only inferior to this in interest. Most of these specimens have been intrusted

to the care of M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards ; for my brother and I believe

that the distinguished author of the ' Oiseaux Fossiles de la France' has

established a claim upon the assistance of all who are interested in extinct

ornithology by that admirable work of his ; and I learn from him that he will

shortly make public the results of these recent discoveries.

Report of the Committee for Superintending the Monthly Reports of

   the Prof/ress of Chemistry , consisting of Professor A. W. William-

   son, F.R.S., Professor Frankland, F.R.S., and Professor Roscoe,

    F.R.S.

During the current year the Chemical Society has continued the publication
of the monthly reports of the progress of Chemistry, which had been com-
menced last year with the aid of the British Association. The labour of
preparing these Beports is considei'able ; and it is due to the chemists who
perform that arduous duty to acknowledge the great care which is bestowed
ujion it by them for a remuneration scarcely more than nominal.

   It has been found necessary, in view of the very great number of chemical
papers, to render the reports very brief, so as to convey a knowledge of the

general results of each paper without giving the details of evidence.

   The Members of the Committee have had the pleasure of noticing that the
reports are considerably valued by English chemists ; and there is reason to
believe that the anticipations which were formed of their usefulness in pro-
moting the advancement of chemistry wiU be fully realized.
       UNIFORMITY OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.     25

Report on the best means of providing for a Uniformity of Weights and
   Measures, with reference to the Interests of Science, by a Com-
   mittee consisting of Sir John Bowring^ F.R.S., The Right Hon.
   Sir Stafford H. Northcote, C.B., M.P., The Right Hon. Sir

   C. B. AdderleYj M.P., Samuel Brown, F.S.S., Dr. Farr, F.R.S.,

  Bazalgette, and Sir W. Fairbairn, Bart., F.R.S.

The Metric Committee of the British Association have much pleasure in

reporting that another great stride has been made towards the attainment

of uniformity in the Weights, Measures, and Coins of all countries by the

passing of a law in Austria, in June 1871, rendering the use of Metric Weights

and Measures permissive from the 1st of January, 1873, and compulsory from

the 1st of January, 1876. The Metric System is gradually diffusing itself all

over Europe. At this moment fully two thirds of that Continent, measured by

population, have adopted the Metric Sj'stem of Weights and Measures, and

the other third has manifested sufficient interest in the question to justify the

expectation of its early adhesion to the general agreement : but in this third

there are comprised Russia and England, two countries which, by their popu-

lation and commerce, exercise an enormous influence in the whole world.

 --The state of the question in Russia appears to be as follows : In 1859 a

Committee of the Imperial Academy of Russia, consisting of the Academicians

Ostrogradski, Jacobi, and Kupffer, issued a report on the subject, which

approved of the decimal division ah-eady incorporated in the Russian System,

the rouble being divided into 100 kopecks, the vedro into 10 krouchki, and

the inch into 10 lines, and expressed an opinion in favour of extending such

decimal divisions to Weights and Measures. In discussing, however, the

possibility of even this moderate reform, the Academicians saw that a very

considerable change would be required. Supposing the foot were retained

as a unit, how could it be decimalized without abandoning altogether such

divisions as the archine, which is 2^, and the sagene, which is 7 feet ? Yet

these are really more in use than the foot itself. And what multiples could

be adopted? The foot of Russia, which is identical with that of England,

is too small to measure cloth by, and 10 feet would be too large a unit.

With such difficulties attending the decimahzation of the existing Weights

and Measures, the Academicians felt that it would be far better for Russia

at once to introduce the Metric System ; and this was the conclusion of

their recommendations. Since the publication of this Report, the Imperial

Academy of Russia has taken an active part in the advance of the system all

over the world. In 18(i7 M. Jacobi was a Member of the International

Committee on Weights, Measures, and Coins in connexion with the Paris

International Exhibition, and wrote the report which was agreed to by

the representatives of all the nations who took part in the Conference on

the subject. And later still, in 1870, on the representation of the Imperial

Academy of Russia to the French Government and to the scientific bodies of

other nations of the need of preparing more accurate and uniform Metric

Standards for the use of countries which might adopt the Metric System, an

International Commission was appointed to prepare such Standards. This

Commission met in Paris in June 1870, and is about to resume its labours

1872.                                       D
                                                                                             ;

in September next. These steps on the part of the Imperial Academy of

Russia have not been  followed  by legislative  action                         yet, when we  consider
                                                                            ;

the just influence which the Academy exercises in a subject of this nature,

it is reasonable to anticipate that their recommendations will be duly heeded,
and that as soon as the Standards are completed the Russian Government

will take into consideration the necessary steps for introducing the Metric

System, whereby the Weights and Measures of Russia may be rendered iden-

tical with those of the greater number of European nations.
   In the Uuited Kingdom considerable progress has been made towards the

introduction of the Metric System, though much certainly remains to be
done. In 1862 a Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to

consider the practicability of adopting a simple and uniform system of

"Weights and Measures, with a view not only to the benefit of our internal

trade, but to facilitate our trade and intercourse with foreign countries. In

discussing the question of the possible decimalization of the existing system,

the Committee of the British House of Commons, in tlie same manner as the

Committee of the Imperial Academy of Russia, reported that it would involve
almost as much difficulty to create a special decimal system of our own as
simply to adopt the Metric Decimal System in common with other nations

and under these circumstances the Committee came to a unanimous recom-

mendation in favour of the introduction of the Metric System.

Accordingly in 1864 an Act was passed to render permissive the use of

such Weights and Measures so far as to legalize contracts made in terms of

Metric Weights and Measures, which were heretofore prohibited ; but no pro-

vision having been made for obtaining correct Standards whereby to verify

Athe same, the use of the System in shops was not thereby pennitted.

Royal Commission has, however, inquired into the question on the Metric

Weights and Measures of the United Kingdom ; and after considerable in-

quiry it issued a report recommending the preparation of such Standards

and the removal of every difficulty which may yet exist in the way of the

Wepermissive use of Metric Weights and Measures.                               may therefore hope

that Her Majesty's Government wiR speedily bring forward a measure for

carrying the recommendation of the Commissioners into effect.

   The appended map of Europe (Plate I.) shows how extensively the Metric

System is already used. If once Russia and England should finally place their

legislation on the same footing, other States will certainly follow, and in Europe,

at least, we shall have attained perfect unity as regards T^eights and Measures.

But in other parts of the world also considerable progress has been made. In

Asia the whole of India maj' be said to have adopted the Weights and Mea-

sures of capacity of the Metric System, though some time may elapse before

the Act passed by the Indian Government can be carried into operation. In

America the United States have introduced it permissively, whilst Brazil, Chili,

Mexico, New Granada, and other American republics have adopted the Metric

System absolutely. Throughout the world as many as 213,000,000 of people

have adopted it absoliitely, 160,000,000 more partially, and 70,000,000 per-

missively, giving a total of 443,000,000.

Nor has there been less done as regards the coinage. If we compare the

coins now in use all over the world with those in use some twenty years ago,

it will be seen what advance we have already made everywhere towards unity.

Some countries, such as Erance, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Greece, and

Roumania, have already an identical system of coinage secured to them by

the Coinage Convention of the 23rd of December, 1865. The Austro-Hun-

garian Empire issues gold pieces marked 20 florins and 8 florins, equal to

25 francs and 1 francs respectively. Spain issues gold pieces of 25 pecetas,

equal to the 25-franc pieces ; and Sweden the Caroline, equal to 10 francs.

The Committee much regret that the German Empire, which had recently

a most favourable opportunity for extending the desired uniformity (an object

to which she has shown her adherence by the recent adoption of the Metric

System), has issued a new gold coinage having nothing in common either

with the money of the Convention of France, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, or

with the monetary systems of England or the United States. It is much to
be desired that we should clearly understand the points on which a common

accord exists in matters of international coinage. There is a general agree-

ment on the advantage of a complete decimal system, on the adoption of the

fineness at nine tenths fine and one tenth alloy; and the greatest number

of States agree also on the adoption of gold as the only standard of value.

Between the three leading systems of the world, founded respectively on the

Franc, the Dollar, and the Pound Sterling, a point of contact has been found

in the 5-franc piece and its multiples, the 5, 10, 20, and 25-franc pieces ; and
considerable agreement has already been obtained in this method of approach-

ing the question. Your Committee would look forward to a much greater

identity of coinage being ultimately realized than would be obtained by this

method                                   but it should be remembei-ed that even the universal  acceptance of
                                      ;

this plan would immensely simplify the relations of coinage between the

diff'erent nations, and of necessity lead to a more identical system.

During lasfyear your Committee have had communications with the Indian

Government on the question of introducing the Metric System of Weights and

Measures in India, the original Act by which all the Weights and Measures

of the System were introduced having been vetoed by the Home Government,

and another, limited to Weights and Measures of capacity, having been passed

in its stead. In England the action of the Committee has been most influ-

ential, especially in connexion with education. It was at the instance of this

Committee that the Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council on Education

have inserted in the Code a clause requii'ing that instruction on the Metric

Weights and Measures shall be given in the Elementary Schools in the King-

dom. And in order to stimulate education on the subject, to explain the

general character of the Metric System and its relation to the Imperial, and

to indicate the advantages which would result from an International System

of Weights and Measures, yoiir Committee have granted to the British and

Foreign Schools, the National Schools, the Wesleyan Schools, and the Con-

gregational Schools in England, as well as to the National Schools in Ireland,

copies of Books and Diagrams on the Metric System, which have been grate-

fully received. The Committee were anxious to purchase a set of Metric

Standards, as stated in their last Report, for the purpose of illustrating

lectures and papers on the subject; but they found that while their cost would

have absorbed nearly the whole vote, it would have been impossible to lend

out such standards without endangering their preservation.

In January 1872 a public meeting was held at the Mansion House, under

the presidency of Sir John Bennett, Sherifi' of London, when resolutions were

passed in favour of the early introduction of the Metric System of Weights

and Measures and the Decimal Division generally. At this meeting Sir John

Lubbock, F.R.S., General Strachey. of the India House, the Rev. William

Jowitt, Dr. Farr, F.R.S., the Hon. N. G. Northope, Superintendent of Public

Instruction in the United States, the Hon. Mr. Ryan, of the Canadian Senate,

and other persons of distinction took part.

The tmification of the Weights, Measures, and Coins all over the world is

                                                                      d2

fraught with immense benefit to science, commerce, and civilization, and philo-
sophical and scientific bodies of all nations have given their adhesion to it ; the
commercial classes look to such unification as an essential element in the eco-

nomy of time and the performance of international works, and travellers all over

the world regard it as the greatest boon that could be conferred. Towards
the attainment of this important object, the Metric Committee of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science have exercised an important in-
fluence ; and they trust that if they are allowed to continue their action for a
few years longer, they will be able 'to report the recognition all over the world
of the princijjle for the promotion of which they were appointed.

    In conclusion, your Committee recommend their reappointment.

Eighth Report of the Committee for Exploring Kent's Cavern, Devon-
   shire, the Committee consisting of Sir Charles Lyell, Bart.,

   F.R.S., Professor Phillips, F.R.S., Sir John Lubbock^ Bart.,
   F.R.S., John Evans, F.R.S., Edward Vivian, M.A., George
   Busk, F.R.S., William Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., William Aysh-
   FORD Sanford, F.G.S., a?i6? William Pengelly, F.R.S. {Reporter).

In commencing this, their Eighth Report, the Committee have to state that

since their last Report was sent in (Edinburgh, 1871) the excavations have

been carried on by the same workmen, without interruption, and in all

respects in the same manner as in former years.

The visitors to the Cavern have continued to be very numerous. Amongst

those accompanied by the Superintendents, the following may be mentioned :

The Emperor Napoleon III., the Prince Murat, the Prince and Princess of

Oldenberg, Sir W. Jardine, Bart., Sir W. Topham, Rev. M. Brown, Rev. G.

Buckle, Rev. Mr. Drewe, Rev. Dr. MacGrcgor, Rev. F. A. Saville, Rev. W.

Thompson, Rev. H. H. Winwood, A. D. W. R. B. Cochrane, M.P.,W. H. Smith,

M.P., General Freeze, C.B., R.A., Colonel Naylor, Colonel W. Pinuey, Captain

S. P. Oliver, R.A., Professor F. Roemer, of Breslau, Professor A. Newton,

Dr. Bond, Dr. Hounsell, Dr. Schmidt, of Essen, Rhenish Prussia, and Messrs.

--Bosanquet, H. H. Bothamley, W. R. A. Boylo, Chaplin, B. J. M. Donne,

-- --Stewart, J. StUweU, G. C. Swayne, E. B. Tawney, B. Tower, "Waldegrave,

W. Vicary, I. Whitwell, and A. "W. Wills. The Cavern has also been visited

bj^ the Exeter Naturalists' Club, and by a large party of Members of the

British Medical Association, at the close of the Annual Meeting at Plymouth

in August 1871, including Rev. Professor Haughton, Professor Lister, Dr.

Crossby, of Nice, Dr. A. Godson, Dr. Lang, Dr. Macnamara, Dr. Murphy,

Dr. W. Roberts, and Mr. Wilde.

Visitors of a much less welcome character have also been numerous during

the year. In February last the workmen somewhat frequently observed

several large rats running about the Cavern, but for some time failed in all

their efforts to capture them. One morning one of the men, on commencing

his work, wrapped his dinner-bag in the coat he had just taken off, and put

the whole carefully aside. At dinner-time the coat was found to be eaten

Athrough, and the bag with its contents was gone.  few days after, the other

man, having taken his dinner, placed his bag, containing a piece of bread, in a

basket, and fastened the cover. On leaving work, he found a hole had been
ON Kent's cavern^ Devonshire,  29

  eaten through the basket, the bag was torn iuto the merest shreds, and the bread

 was gone. Thus stimulated, the men baited their traps with great care, and
 had the pleasure of catching seven or eight rats. No further annoyance was
 experienced until July, when a large rat was seen to enter the Cavern about

 midday. The poor wretch was found dead in the trap in a day or two.
     During the last twelve months the Committee have explored the branches

 of the " Western Division " of the Cavern known as " The "Wolf's Cave,"
 " The Cave of Rodentia," and " The Charcoal Cave," and have commenced
 " The Long Arcade."

  --The Wolfs Cave. That branch of the Cavern which extends in a northerly

 direction from "The Sloping Chamber" was, by Mr. MacEnery, termed "The
 Wolfs Cave," and occasionally "The Idol Cave"*. It received the latter
 name from " a column of spar " which, " near its entrance, joined the ceiling
 and floor and obstructed the way," and " had a singular resemblance to a
 Hindoo Idol " f ; and the former, because, on the removal of this " column," it
 was found to have " covered the head of a wolf, perhaps the largest and

 finest skuU, whether fossil or modern, of that animal in the world "J.
    Mr. MacEnery seems to have been eminently successful in collecting speci-

 mens in this branch of the Cavern ; for he states that " of the quantity and

 condition of the remains here it is scarcely possible to give a just idea with-
 out appearing to exaggerate. They were so thickly packed together that,

 to avoid injuring them, we were obliged to lay aside the picks and to grub
 them out with our fingers. They were found driven into the interstices of

 the opposite wall, or piled in the greatest confusion against its sides, with but
 a scanty covering of soil, and that of the finest and softest sand intermixed
 with greasy earth. To enumerate the amount of fossils collected from this

spot would be to give the inventory of half my collection, comprising all the

g8enera and their species, including the cuUridens. There were hoards."
Here, too, he appears to have found all the remains of Machairodus latidens
(known then as Ursiis cultrklcns) the Cavern yielded him, which he states

were five canines and one incisor§.

   When completely excavated to the depth of 4 feet below the base of the

Stalagmitic Floor, this Cave was found to extend nearly 70 feet in a north-

westerly direction, and at its entrance, or junction with the Sloping Chamber,
to be about 40 feet wide. At 3 yards inside the entrance it narrows to about
20 feet, at 7 yards to 10 feet, and beyond this its general width is from 7 to
8 feet . Its present height is about 7 feet throughout; but before the com-

                                        II

mencement of Mr. MacEnery's diggings, the space between the Limestone Roof
and the Stalagmitic Floor could nowhere have exceeded 2 feet, even if the latter
had been entirely free from rubbish. Indeed he states that when they first
entered this branch, he and his companions " crawled like tortoises "^.

   At the entrance the Ptoof is commonly fretted as if by the action of acidu-
lated water ; but here and there, and especially on the eastern side, its com-

paratively fresh and smooth aspect indicates what may be termed the recent

fall of masses of limestone from it,--an indication confirmed by the presence
of such masses, some of them of great dimensions, immediately below. At
intervals throughout the entire length of the Cave transverse lines of frac-
ture, or divisional planes, appear in the Roof : some of them are close-fitting,

  * He also spoke of it sometimes as " The Wolfs Passage " and " The Wolfs Grave."

      The breadth is always measured at the level of the surface of the Cave-earth. In thi.s

              II

Cave it was invariably narrower at the bottom of the excavation.

but occasionally they have been corroded or fretted into cavities of rudely
elliptical outline, fi'om a foot to 2 feet in height. The largest of them

measures 5 feet long and something less than 1 foot wide ; its walls are

much fretted, and numerous pipe-like stalactites depend from its roof. Some

of the holes are completely lined with stalactite, whilst others are quite bare.

There are no traces of Cave-earth in any of them.

   The north-eastern waU of the Cave, from the entrance to nearly 30 feet within
it, is a confused mass of large fallen blocks of limestone. With this excep-

tion, the walls, as in the other branches of the Cavern, consist of beds of

hraestone in situ. They are not much fretted, their edges are all more or'

less angular, and they are here and there traversed by fissures corresponding

with the lines of fracture in the Eoof.

   From the considerable remnants left undisturbed by Mr. MacEneiy, there

was, no doubt, a continuous " Granular Stalagmitic Floor " from end to end.

It seems to have varied from 3 to 12 inches in thickness, and to have possessed

the granular and laminated structure characteristic of the Floor covering the

" Cave-earth." In a large area at the south-eastern angle of the Cave the

Floor had been left untouched, and was found to be in some cases fully 2 feet

thick. Like that in a great part of the adjacent Sloping Chamber, of which

it is a prolongation, it contained numerous large masses of limestone and of
the " Old Crystalline Stalagmitic Floor " so frequently mentioned in former

Keports.

Similar masses, of both kinds, were abundant in the Cave-earth below the

Floor  in  the  area just  mentioned                                               and in some instances the blocks of hme-
                                                                                ;

stone lay across one another with but little deposit between them, as if they

had fallen after the accumulation of Cave-earth had ceased. In a few in-

stances the cavities or interspaces were not covered with the Stalagmite,

and some of them contained a few recent bones and other objects.

Omitting this south-eastern area, Mr. MacEnery extended his researches

quite to the innermost point of the Cave, and, with few exceptions, up to

13 feet from the entrance, had broken up and searched the entire deposit to

a depth exceeding the Committee's four-feet sections. Within the point just

specified, he contented himself with cutting a comparatively narrow trench,

leaving the ground quite intact adjacent to, and a few feet from, the south-

western wall, but, as before, carrying his excavations to a depth exceeding 4

feet. At 24 feet from the entrance, however, he dug to no greater depth than

--2 feet, and very rarely exceeded this in the inner part of the Cave, thus leaving

the Committee's third and fourth foot-levels everywhere intact, besides the belt

adjacent to the south-western wall, of which, as already mentioned, no portion

was touched. This margin, it may be presumed, was left intact in consequence

of all the excavated material being lodged on it. No portion of the latter

appears to have been taken out of the Cave.

The deposit the Committee found in the Wolfs Cave, whether disturbed or

undisturbed, was well-marked typical Cave-earth, consisting of red loam with

about 50 per cent, of angular fragments of limestone. There were no traces
of the older deposit termed " Breccia " in previous Eeports, either in situ or

redeposited, and, excepting the area in the south-eastern corner, already

mentioned, no fragments of the Old Crystalline Stalagmitic Floor.

    In proceeding to the objects found in the Wolf's Cave, it is obvious that

nothing can be said about such as may have been on or in the Stalagmitic

Floor ; they, if such there were, had no doubt been secured by the earher

the blocks of limestone lying confusedly in the south-eastern portion of the

Cave. In some of these, all of them being sealed up with Stalagmite, shells
of the common Pecten (Pecten maximus, Linn.) were found, amounting to a
total of twenty-five. Most of them were large shells, and some were thickly
incrusted with calcareous matter containing, in one or two cases, traces of
charred wood. In one instance two, and in another five, shells were found

fitted neatly into one another, and cemented together with carbonate of lime,

thus leaving no doubt that man had not only packed them, but placed them

where they were found. The fact that some of them were '« dead shells,"
having Serpute attached to their inner surfaces, indicates, of course, that they
were not in all cases taken to the Cavern because they contained an article of

food, but probably sometimes, at least, as domestic vessels.

   The undisturbed Cave-earth in this branch of the Cavern yielded a con-
siderable number of the remains of the ordinary Cave-mammals, including
nearly sixty shells, which may be distributed as in the following Table :

   It wiU be remembered that the Cave-earth is excavated in vertical shoes
or " Parallels " extending generally from wall to wall of the branch of the
Cavern under exploration, to a depth of 4 feet and a horizontal thickness of
1 foot ; that each Parallel is taken out in 4 successive " Levels," each a foot
in vertical depth ; and each Level in " Yards," or masses 3 feet in length.

   From what has been already stated, it is obvious that in the Wolf's Cave

there were no continuous first or second Foot-levels intact, and that even the
third and fourth were not everywhere met with. Confining attention to the
twenty-one instances of each of the two latter which did occur in the same
Parallels, the following Table will show the distribution of the teeth of the

various kinds of Mammals in them :

32 REPORT 1872.

--The following examples will serve to explain Table II. : Teeth of hyaena

occurred in the third Foot-level in 16 distinct Parallels, and in the same

number in the fourth ; but as they were met with in a total number of 19
+ --(=16Parallels only, it is obvious that in 13 instances
                                                         16 19) they

occurred in both levels in the same Parallel.

   Again, as the Table comprehends 21 Parallels, and teeth of hyaena were

--found in 19 only, it follows that there were 2 Parallels (=21 19) in which

no teeth of this genus presented themselves.
   Further, a total of 131 teeth of hytena were exhumed in the 19 Parallels,

and of these 63 were in the third Foot-level, and 68 in the fourth or lowest

hence the different Levels were almost equally rich, and on the average

--several teeth occurred in one and the same Level and Parallel.
   To take another example : Teeth of bear were found in the third

Foot-level in 4 Parallels, and in the fourth Foot-level in 2 ; but as they
occurred in a total number of 6 Parallels, it is obvious that in no in-

stance were they met with in both Levels in one and the same Parallel

(44-2-6 = 0).

   Again, as the Table comprehends 21 Parallels, and teeth of bear were

--found in 6 only, it follows that there were 15 Parallels (21 6=15) in which

no teeth of this genus presented themselves.
   Further, a total of 6 teeth of bear were exhumed in the 6 Parallels, and of

these 4 were in the third Level and 2 in the fourth or lowest ; hence the

third was the richest Level, if the slender evidence may be trusted ; and the

teeth occurred singly, no more than one having in any instance been found

in the same Parallel.

   It is perhaps noteworthy that whilst teeth of rabbit and fox occuiTed in
the Wolf's Cave, as is shown in Table I., they did not, according to Table II.,

present themselves in either the third or fourth Level.

As in previous years, the Committee have removed and examined the

deposits dug up and thrown aside by Mr. MacEnery. In the Wolf's Cave,

as elsewhere, this material yielded a large number of the remains of the

ordinary Cave-mammals, including about 350 teeth, which may be thus

apportioned :

--Table III. Showing how many per cent, of the Teeth found in the disturbed

   material in the Wolfs Cave belonged to the different kinds of Mammals.

Hysena                 36 per cent.  Bear                1-5 per cent.
Horse                                Deer                1-5 ,,
Ehinoceros             33-5  ,,      Badger ....         1-5 ,,
Megaceros                                                less than 1 per cent.

                       2,,

   Though it would be utterly useless to compare Tables I. and III., since
the latter includes teeth not only from all Levels, but possibly such as were
lying on the Stalagmitic Floor, as well, perhaps, as more recent introductions,
it is not without interest to observe that even amongst the rejected or neglected
specimens, as the case may be, as well as in the undisturbed Cave-earth in
every branch of the Cavern, the most prevalent forms are hysena, horse, and
rhinoceros, and that their relative prevalence is indicated by the order in
which they have been named.

   The bones and teeth present much the same characters as those found in
previous years. Thus, many of the latter are in jaws or fragments of jaws,

destitute, as usual, of their condyles, and, in most cases, of the lower borders
ON Kent's cavern, Devonshire.  33

also. Most of the specimens have an almost white colour, but some are of a
dark hue ; some are more or less coated with stalagmite, some are broken,
some split, and very few have escaped the teeth of the hyaena. Amongst the

finer and more remarkable specimens may be mentioned jaws of hyaena,

canines of lion and bear, a left lower molar of Elephas primigenius, part of
left lower jaw of rhinoceros, and a portion of a palate and both upper jaws of

megaceros.

    One of the canines of bear (No. 5537) is so peculiarly worn or cut, both
on the crown and on the fang, and especially the latter, as to suggest the
probabihty of human agency. On account of its strange aspect it was for-
warded to Mr. 6. Busk, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, F.R.S.,

--V.P.L.S.5 &c., a member of the Committee, who thus remarks on it : " The

bear's canine (5537) is certainly very curiously worn if it be naturally so.
The wearing of the crown part is possible enough, perhaps ; but I cannot
account for the apparently worn portion of the fang, which, of course, during
life must have been protected from wear. But what could be the object
of such an implement if it were manufactured ? Perhaps a kind of gouge

--or chisel." (Signed) Geokge Busk.
    The mammoth's grinder (No. 5575) is almost perfect. Its crown measures
6 inches in length and 2*5 inches in greatest breadth. It was found Sep-
tember 13, 1871, in the third Foot-level, with 22 teeth of hyaena in parts of
5 jaws, 2 of rhinoceros, 1 of bear, with several large bones and fragments of
bone. The bear's tooth just mentioned was a canine worn almost to the
fang, which measures 1-7 inch in width.

    The rhinoceros jaw (No. 5562), which has lost its condyles, but not its
lower border, contains 4 consecutive molars, and is quite the finest specimen
 of the kind met with by the Committee. It was found September 2, 1871,
 in the third Level, with a tooth of bear, bones, and fragments of bone.

    The jaws and palate of megaceros (No. 5646) contain 6 consecutive molars
 on the left side, and 5 on the right. This specimen was found October 10,

 1871, in the third Level, with 1 tooth of rhinoceros, 1 of megaceros, 5 of
 horse, 6 of hynaea in parts of 2 jaws, bones, and splinters of bone.

    Though Mr. MacEnery was not so fortunate as to find any flint implements
 in the Wolfs Cave, the Committee met with 5 ; and 4 of them are amongst

 the best specimens the Cavern has yielded.
     No. 5563 is a white lanceolate implement, 2-8 inches long, -85 inch broad,

 and '2 inch thick. It has a strong subcentral longitudinal ridge on one
 surface, is slightly concave longitudinally and convex transversely on the
 other, reduced to an edge on both margins, rounded and rather blunt at one
 end, abruptly truncated at the other, and has apparently seen some service.
 It was found September 2, 1871, in the fourth Level, with 1 tooth of bear,
 1 of rhinoceros, 3 of hyaena, 3 of horse, and 1 of ox.

     No. 5571 is a pale grey flint implement of delicate proportions. It is 3-7
 inches long, ·65 inch in greatest breadth, and ·! inch in greatest thickness.
 It is longitudinally and transversely convex on one side, somewhat strongly
 concave lengthways, but slightly convex in the direction of its breadth on
 the other, has a long narrow oval form, three ridges ou its convex side, a thin
 edge all round its perimeter except at one end which is rather blunt, and does
 not appear to have been used. It was found September 9, 1871, in the third
  Level, with 4 teeth of hyaena, 1 of rhinoceros, 1 of horse, 1 of ox, and frag-
  ments of bone scored with teeth-marks.

     No. 5592 is a chert implement, rudely quadrilateral in foi-m, 2-5 inches
 long, 2-2 inches broad, '6 inch thick, and has apparently been used. It was
                                                                               ;

34 REPORT--1872.

found September 20, 1871, in the first Level, with 2 teeth of horse and 1 of

rhinoceros.

   No. 5602 is a strongly proportioned chert lanceolate implement, 3'9 inches
long, 1-1 inch broad, and -4 inch thick. It is concave on one face, very
strongly carinated on the other, truncated at one end, pointed but blunt at
the other, and worked to an edge along its two margins. It was found Sep-
tember 22, 1871, in the fourth Level, with 4 teeth of hyaena, 2 of horse, and
several fragments of bone.

   No. 5656 is a somewhat irregular ovate chert tool, unequally convex on its
two faces, 4-2 inches long, 3'3 inches in greatest breadth, and -85 inch in
greatest thickness. It has been wrought to an edge around its entire cir-
cumference, but not elaborately finished ; at one small jjart near its broader
end a portion of the original surface of the nodule from which it was formed
remains, and it has apparently been much used. It was found October 13,
1871, in the third Level, but without any bones or teeth in the same Yard.
Three implements of the same type have been mentioned in previous

Ileports *.

  --The Cave of Rodentla. From the north-eastern corner of the Wolfs Cave,

a passage, scarcely 5 feet long, about 5-5 high, and where narrowest not more

than 5 feet wide, leads into a chamber measuring about 25 feet from east to

west, and 20 from north to south. It was termed the " Cave of Rodentia " by

--Mr. MacEnery, who thus describes his researches in it : " We now found our-

selves in the midst of hundreds of Eodentia. Of their remains and dust the

deposit was constituted, agglutinated together by calcareous matter into a bony

breccia. It should have been premised that the stalagmite above them was

about a foot and a half deep, regularly laminated and free from all adventi-

tious matter    It suffered no disturbance or interruption from its first

commencement    The remains of llodentia were wanting in no part of

the Cavern that we had yet examined, .... but here, in this grotto, they

swarmed in countless multitudes. Not only had their tiny remains penetra-

ted into every cleft and crevice of the rock, but they insinuated themselves

even into the chambers of the large bones. The wolf's skull, in the passage,

had its cavities charged and its surface incrusted over with a concretion of

their bones     It was an interesting spectacle to behold myriads of

minute animal remains congregated by the side of elephants, rhinoceroses,

and hyaenas in a common sepulchre. Heads generally crushed ; lower

jaws preserved. When a handful of this dust was thrown into water,

hundreds of teeth rose to the surface, and it was by this means they were

collected " f.

It will be seen from the foregoing quotation that here, too, the Committee

were foUowiug Mr. MacEnery's steps. His labours, however, were on a

less extended scale than in the Wolfs Cave. In the narrow trench to

which he restricted himself, and which was not continuous, his excavations

never extended more than 2 feet, and frequently not more than 18 inches,

below the base of the Stalagmitic Floor. Connected with this Cave, more-

over, there proved to be two recesses, which he did not enter ; indeed he did

not suspect their existence.

The Roof of the Cave of Rodentia slopes gently towards the north. Its

general height above the bottom of the Committee's excavation is about 8 feet

and from this it varies but little, except in one or two places, whence masses

of limestone have recently fallen. The Roof is fretted, and has occasional

flues, extending tortuously upwards, and from 9 to 12 inches in diameter at

the bottom, where they are largest. None of them contain any stalactitic or

earthy matter.

The walls of the Cave are but little fretted, and their edges but slightly

rouuded.

Almost immediately on entering the Cave the workmen had to blast a large

mass of limestone lying on the Stalagmitic Floor, and which in all probability

Adeterred Mr. MacEnery from breaking ground there.                                                                          few yards further

in, a portion of the south wall, certainly in situ, and without obvious in-

dication of severance from the limestone stratum of which it was a part,

was found to project a few feet beyond the general direction, and to

have Cave-earth beneath it. This underlying deposit had been regularly

removed as the successive Parallels were excavated. At length the entire

mass, estimated at a ton in weight, fell and very nearly crushed the principal

workman.

The Stalagmitic Floor, originally continuous across the entire length and

breadth of the Cave, had in great part been broken up by the earlier explo-

rers. Judging from the remnants of it still remaining, it was of the ordinary

granular and laminated character, and from 3 to 12 inches in thickness.

Beneath this Floor the deposit was the common Cave-earth from top to

bottom of the 4-feet sections, except in the northern corner of the Cave,

where the Old Crystalline Stalagmitic Floor, in situ, formed its basis, and

rose like a boss from beneath.

In the excavated deposits thrown aside in this Cave by Mr. MacEnery, the

Committee found bones and teeth as usual, and a bronze gouge 3-2 inches

long, and -75 inch in diameter at the end intended for the reception of the

haft. There can be little or no doubt that it lay on the Stalagmitic Floor

before Mr. MacEnery entered the Cave, and that he failed to observe it.

The only object found in the Granular Stalagmitic Floor (that overlying

the Cave-earth) was a fine os innominatum of a rhinoceros. No. 5743.

   In the intact Cave-earth about 1000 teeth of various kinds of mammals

were met with, and in the ratios shown in the following Table :

In certain parts of the Cave the Cave-earth was found intact in every

Level ; in others the uppermost Foot-level only had been broken up, leaving

the second, third,  and  fourth  undisturbed                                                                 whilst  in  a  third  area  the  two

measuring 4 feet long by 4 feet broad, yielded 36 teeth of hyaena, 5 of deer,
4 of horse, 4 of rhinoceros, 2 of ox, a portion of an elephant's tusk, numerous
bones, and 1 flint flake. The other, in the opposite corner of the Cave,
measured 9 feet by 8 feet, and was found to contain 161 teeth of hyaena
(many of them in parts of jaws, all having lost their condyles), 107 of horse,
40 of rhinoceros, 16 of deer, 10 of bear, 8 of megaceros (of which 5 were in

part of a lower jaw), 5 of elephant, 5 of ox, 5 of sheep, 4 of lion, 1 of fox, a

primigenius. As this tooth is only one half the size of the tooth usually,

but erroneously, regarded as the m.-m. 1, I consider that it represents the

very rare occurrence of a true m.-m. 1. If not, it is the smallest tooth of

the kind I am acquainted with, except in the Maltese dwarf elephants {vide

my paper in Zool. Trans, vol. vi. pi. 53. fig. 2). The proper dimensions of

m.-m. 2 in Elephas primigenius are about -8 inch X '7 inch, and the smallest

I have seen of El. indicus is -6 x -48 ; whilst a tooth in the Zebbug collection
is -4 X -32, and the present one -45 x '3, or nearly the same. One objection,
however, and that a strong one, to the present tooth being really m.-m. 1,

arises from its having two divergent fangs, while the Zebbug tooth has only

one, or two connate into one. This is a very curious specimen, and, as re-

--gards the elephant, of remarkable interest." (Signed) George Busk.
   Several good specimens of coprolite were met with both in the Cave of

Rodentia and the Wolfs Cave.
   Five implements and flakes of flint and chert were found in the former

Cave, but none of  them rank amongst the best  of the        Cavern series                                                  indeed

one only (No. 5741) requires special description. It is a light grey flint,

rudely oval in form, irregularly convex on both faces, 2-8 inches long, 2-4

inches broad, and -95 inch in greatest thickness. Though it has undergone

a considerable amount of chipping, and is reduced to an edge all round, it is
by no means a well-finished, but was probably a very efficient, " scraper."
38 REPORT--1872.

It was found November 18, 1871, with 5 teeth of hyaena, 2 of raegaceros,
1 of horse, and 1 of rhinoceros, in the third Level of Cave-earth.

    Besides the implements, there is a jiiece of chert having the form of a rude
triangular pyramid, 3-2 inches high, its scalene base being 3'3 inches long
and 1*2 inch broad. It was found November 30, 1871, with 2 teeth of
hyaena, 3 of horse, and 1 of ox, in the third Level of Cave-earth. Its form
is scarcely indicative of an artificial origin ; and though its edges are some-
what rounded, it does not seem possible for it to have been transported by

natural agency from the nearest locality in which such material is now found
in situ, without being much more rounded than it is.

    Before proceeding to another branch of the Cavern, the Committee would
remark that they commenced their investigation of the Wolfs Cave on July
12, 1871, and from that time until they had reached its termination, as well
as that of its offshoot, the Cave of Rodentia (a period of nearly six months),
they cherished the hope that, like Mr. MacEnery, they might find some remains
of Macliairodiis latidens. During their progress they were daily face to face
with their energetic predecessor's labours, and from time to time met with
the tools with which they were performed * ; but they had finally to leave
the two Caves on December 30, 1871, with a feeling of great disappointment

that neither amongst the many hundreds of specimens which Mr. MacEnery

had left in his broken ground, nor in the Cave-earth remaining intact beside
and beneath his diggings, had they met with any trace of the great object
and hope of their search.

   MacEnery states that he found the famous canines "in diluvial mud mixed

with teeth and gnawed bones of rhinoceros, elephant, horse, ox, elk, and deer,
with teeth and bones of hyaenas, bears, wolves, foxes, &c.'"t, and that he
subsequently discovered an incisor of the same species in the same bed J. It
will be seen from Table III., given above, that, with scarcely any other
exception than that of Machairodits, such an assemblage of remains as he
enumerates was actually found by the Committee in the very soil which he
had examined and cast aside ; and from Table I., that of the animals in his
list, just quoted, the great sabre-toothed Felis was the only one which failed
to present itself when the Committee broke up the undisturbed Cave-earth

lying below that which yielded the canines and incisor. When to this it is

added that the most careful search by the Committee failed to detect in the
Cave-earth which they excavated any remnant of the older Cavern deposit,
and that MacEnery was struck with the fact that, though " dehcately edged,"
the canines were found quite uninjured in the midst of the shattered bones §,
a strong case seems to be made out in favour of the propositions that Machair-
odus belonged to the Devonshire Cave-earth fauna, and that his remains
found in Kent's Cavern were not redeposited fossils.

  --The Charcoal Cave. Two passages open out of the south-west comer of

the Sloping Chamber, opposite the entrance of the Wolfs Cave. The more
important is of considerable length, and leads in a south-westerly direction
to a series of large chambers, in which the Committee have not yet under-
taken any researches. Mr. MacEnery designated this the " Long Arcade."

   Very near its mouth is the entrance of the second passage, to which, for a

reason which will shortly appear, the Superintendents have given the name
of the " Charcoal Cave." This passage the Committee proceeded to explore

before undertaking the Arcade.

It extends on the whole in a southerly direction for a distance of upwards

of 50 feet, varying from 5 to 13 feet in breadth, and throughout the

first half of its length maintaining a tolerably uniform height of from 9 to

10 feet. At 16 feet from the entrance it sends off a branch in an easterly

direction, and at 26 feet a second branch towards the south-west; re-

solving itself, in short, into three passages, which ultimately reiinite, and

may conveniently be termed the " Northern," " Central," and " Southern "

branches. They have all, but especially the northern, the aspect of long-

coutinued watercourses fretted by the subsequent and unequal action of

acidulated water. Mouths of " flues " present themselves in the roofs and

walls                               but none of them have any traces of earthy matter, and few are lined
                                 ;

with stalactite. The branches are subject to a very copious drip very soon

after rains, but no portion of it enters through the flues just mentioned.

   At 18 feet from the entrance of the Cave a thin layer of black matter,
among which charcoal was conspicuous, was observed lying on the surface of

the Stalagmitic Floor, where it covered an area of about 2 square feet. It
was thought to be probably the remains of a fire kindled by some recent

visitors to the Cavern, though the place seemed an unlikely one for such a

purpose, the roof being no more than 4 feet above the floor before the exca-

vation, and the narrow passage being very seldom entered by visitors. The

whole of the material was carefully collected, and, on being washed and

--examined, yielded the foUomng assemblage of objects : Small rough pieces

of stalagmitic matter ; bits of charcoal, some of them incorporated in the

stalagmitic matter just mentioned                                                                                                                                               upwards of a dozen small pieces of very
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

coarse friable pottery, of a reddish colour, without any trace of ornamenta-

tion, and in all probability parts of one and the same vessel ; two unworn
lower "wisdom teeth" of a human subject; a few entire phalangeal bones,

apparently of an individual barely mature                                                                                                                                                                               part of an ulna, of a pelvis, of a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

vertebra, of ribs, and numerous small fragments of bone ; an almost perfect

left lower jaw of a fox, containing the canine tooth and five molars ; a few

incisors and bones of small rodents.

   In accordance with the practice invariably followed since the commence-
ment of the exploration, the water in which the objects just mentioned were
washed was passed through a fine sieve for the purpose of detecting minute

objects of interest. This water was almost black from the fine matter held
in suspension, and which, on being deposited and dried, proved to be fine
silt coloured with charcoal.

   As earlier explorers of the Cavern had in one place in this Cave attempted

to break through the Stalagmitic Floor at a point further in than the spot
occupied by the black material, and must have frequently trampled on it,
there is no difficulty in accounting for the broken condition of the pottery,
the charcoal, and most of the bones. It is scarcely necessary to observe that

the Charcoal Cave takes its name from the patch of black matter just

described.

   Mr. Charles Rodway, a distinguished dentist of Torquay, to whom the

human teeth mentioned above were submitted, was so good as to furnish the

following note respecting them :

are the teeth of a subject between the age of 15 and 20 years, judging from

the undeveloped state of the roots, which later in life would be longer, with

the pnlp-cavity at the apices considerably smaller. I notice upon the lingual

surface of the left tooth what I take to be a deposit of salivary calculus, which

leads me to suppose that they were already erupted from the gum, although

not sufficiently risen to have been used in mastication, as the enamel on the

masticating-surface does not appear to have been subjected to friction. It would

be impossible to say whether they are the teeth of a male or female but from
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

rodents, all the osseous remains were believed by the Superintendents of the

Exploration to be those of a human subject of about the age indicated by the
wisdom teeth, and were all forwarded to Mr. G. Busk, who has furnished the

to whom Mr. Rodway says the teeth belonged, all the remains are portions

of the same skeleton, and that they had been preserved in a cinerary urn of
which the potsherds found with them were fragments.

   There was a continuous Stalagmitic Floor from the entrance of the Char-
coal Cave to 19 feet mthin it, except at one place, where it did not quite ex-
tend from wall to wall. In the next 5 feet the Cave-earth was without any
covering, but at 25 feet from the entrance a floor again presented itself. It
was of the usual character, varied from 2 to 12 inches thick, and near the

entrance there was in it, about 2 inches below the surface, a thin layer of

carbonaceous matter.

   In the northern branch the floor was everywhere continuous, and varied
from 18 inches thick at the entrance to 1 inch at the inner end. In the
central branch the floor was but partial, never exceeded 9 inches thick, and
was occasionally no more than a mere film. In one or two instances pieces
of Old Crystalline Floor were incorporated in it. There was very little floor

in the southern branch.

   Remnants of an old floor hi situ, extending from waU to wall, presented

themselves in each of the branches, always at some height above the Cave-
earth. They were indications, of course, of the former existence, and at
least partial dislodgement, of a deposit older than the Cave-earth, and which
there attained a higher level. The most considerable of them was in the
central branch : it was from 9 to 10 feet long, 3 inches thick ; its upper
surface was 1-5 foot below the limestone roof, and its lower surface 4 feet
above the granular Stalagmitic Floor, the spaces between it and the ruof
above, and the ordinary floor below, being quite unoccupied. The remnants
in the other branches differ from this in their measurements only.

   With exceptions in portions of the central and southern branches, to be
noticed immediately, the mechanical deposit in the Charcoal Cave was true
Cave-earth. At the entrance, and for about 11 feet within, it contained an
unusually great number of fragments of limestone from top to bottom of the
section. Beyond the point just specified, up to 18 feet from the entrance,
such fragments were rare, except in the uppermost Foot-level, where they
still abounded ; their place below being taken by a few pieces of red grit,
some of which were fossiliferous, whilst the Cave-earth became very sandy.

   From the first to the second Isifurcation of the Cave, as well as for a few
feet within each branch, the Cave-earth was no more than from 1 to 3-5 feet

--deep, and rested on a continuous, but very uneven, limestone floor an

instance, and probably the only one yet known in the Cavern, of this floor

being reached.

In the northern branch the deposit was true Cave-earth throughout. In

the central one the Cave-earth contained a few pieces of Old Crystalline

Floor, and throughout the innermost 10 feet rested immediately on the old

dark red Breccia, found elsewhere in the Cavern beneath the Crystalline

Stalagmitic Floor. In the southern branch nothing but true Cave-earth was

found from the entrance to 8 feet within it ; but beyond that to the end, a

distance of 17 feet, from the base of the section to 2-5 and even 3 feet above

it, the entire accumulation was the old dark red Breccia, rock-like in its

cohesion, continuous from wall to wall, and clearly i?i situ.

It may be well at this point to give a brief recapitulation of the facts as

they presented themselves in ascending, but not necessarily chronological,

order, in the same vertical section, in the central and southern branches :

from the adjacent loftier hills, but not from the comparatively low one in
which the Cavern occurs. Its depth is unknown, as its base has not been

reached.

   Second. Cave-earth, consisting of a somewhat light red loam and generally
about 50 per cent, of angular fragments of limestone, with an occasional
pebble not derivable from the Cavern-hill. Its depth was variable, but never

less than 1 foot.

  AThird. floor of granular Stalagmite, from 1 to 18 inches thick.

   Fourth. An unoccupied space from 1 to 4 feet high.

  AFifth. floor of Crystalline Stalagmite from 3 to 4 inches thick.

   Sixth. An unoccupied space from 1 to 3'5 feet high.

   Seventh. The limestone roof of the Cave.
   Were we to speculate on the history of the Charcoal Cave as indicated in
the facts just described, we should find ourselves taken back to the time when

it was formed, not by any convulsion, but by the actual and probably gradual

removal of the limestone which once filled the entire space between the walls,

as is shown by the unfissured roof and the continuous limestone floor.

    Secondly, so far as can be ascertained, the introduction of angular, sub-

angular, and rounded pebbles of dark red grit, with sandy mud derived from

their attrition, until the Cave and its branches were filled almost to the roof.
   Thirdly, the introduction of materials from without having ceased, the

Breccia which had accumulated was hermetically sealed up with a cake of

--Crystalline Stalagmite, from 3 to 4 inches thick the result of the slow solu-

tion and precipitation of calcareous matter.
   Fourthly, the Crystalline Stalagmite was partially broken up, and a portion

of the Breccia was dislodged, the removal being more complete in some parts
than in others.

   Fifthly, again there was introduced a mechanical deposit, but instead of
dark red grit and sandy mud, it consisted of a light red loam and angular

fragments of limestone of various sizes. It did not attain to so great a height
as the previous deposit of dark red material.

    Sixthly, a floor of Stalagmite, differing from the former in being granular
instead of crystalline, was formed on the red loam or Cave-earth, at a lower
level than that which sealed up the Breccia.

   Seventhly and lastly, this latter floor being completed, there was placed on
it a small cinerary urn, containing human bones and bits of charcoal.

   But to return. The deposits in the Charcoal Cave were by no means rich
in osseous remains. The granular stalagmite jaelded a few unimportant
bones only, and in the Cave-earth there was but a comparatively small
number of bones, and no more than 85 teeth. The latter belonged to diff'erent
kinds of mammals in the ratios shown in the following Table :

temporaries were met with), it was anthropologically by far the most impor-

tant object the Cavern had yielded. From that time the Committee have had

no opportunity of investigating this old Breccia, and hence no announcement of

further discoveries of the kind were looked for in their Sixth or Seventh Reports

(1870 and 1871). They are now, however, enabled to return to the subject,

and to state that the Breccia has yielded two additional flint implements.

  The first of these (No. 5900) was found May 22, 1872, in the southern

branch, from 1 to 2 feet deep in the Breccia, in which it was firmly im-

bedded ; and over this was an accumulation of typical Cave-earth, having no
Stalagmitic Floor either above or below it. There were no bones found near

the implement ; but vertically above it, in the Cave-earth, were the small

flake of white flint and the 2 teeth of hycena just mentioned. It is rude in

form, rather over 5 inches in greatest length, scarcely 3 inches wide, and

about 1-5 inch in greatest thickness. It exhibits a small portion of the sur-

face of the nodule from which it was made, is of a dull cream colour, and its

weight is less than that of ordinary flints of the same size ; in these respects

resembling some of the tools found in the Windmill-Hill Cavern at Brixham.

All the dimensions of the second implement (No. 5903) slightly exceed

those of that just described. Its colour is a pinkish cream ; one of its surfaces

is nearly flat, whilst the other is very convex, and retains much of the sur-
face of the original nodule. One of the Superintendents, who assisted to

extract it, had the opportunity of studying it before any attempt was made

to move it. The Breccia was compactly cemented together, and the imple-

ment was firmly imbedded in it, at 1 foot below its surface, above which was

Cave-earth to the depth of 27 inches, and, without being covered with sta-

lagmite, reaching within 3 inches of the roof; in other words, the united

thickness of the two deposits overlying the tool was 39 inches. It was di-

stinctly observed to be fractured ; and as the severed portions were in such

close contact as to render the line of junction almost microscopic, it had obvi-

ously been broken where it lay. Every care was taken in its removal ; but on

being extracted it fell into three pieces, one of which remained firmly attached

to and incorporated in a lump of the Breccia. The fractured surfaces showed

that its colour was whitish throughout, and that its texture was granular. It

was found May 27, 1872, in the southern branch of the Cave, about 2 feet from

the specimen just described (No. 5900), and, like that, had no bones near it.

The excavation of the Charcoal Cave and its branches was completed July 7,

1872, the labour of 4-5 months having been expended on it.

 --The Long Arcade. The principal passage opening out of the south-west

corner of the Sloping Chamber, as already mentioned, was termed the Long
Arcade by Mr. MacEnery f, and the " Hysena Cloaca Maxima " by Dr. Buck-
land t. It has a direction towards south-west, and is the great thoroughfare
to the " Labyrinth," " Bear's Den," and " Cave of Inscriptions." Its explora-

tion is at present in progress. Up to the end of July about ten weeks' work

had been expended on it ; but a very large amount remains to be done there.

Mr. MacEnery had commenced the exploration of the Arcade, but meeting

with fewer fossils than he hoped, soon abandoned it §.

   At its entrance this branch of the Cavern is about 17 feet in width and 13
in height. The roof is the naked limestone, much fretted or honeycombed.
The Granular Stalagmitic Floor was continuous in every direction and of very
great thickness. Its surface, for some distance, was occupied by a series of

natui-al basins, bounded by stalagmitic walls rising above the general level of
the floor. They varied in depth from an inch to fvdly a foot, and in wet

seasons were constantly fuU of water. Similar basins occur in other parts of
the Cavern, but those at the mouth of the Arcade (the great thoroughfare)
have attracted a large amount of attention. Mr. MacEnery described them as
" encircled with wavy walls, rivalling the most exquisite works in pastry"*.

When breaking up the floor it was observed that the bottoms of the basins

were formed of a softer looser stalagmite than that composing the walls, and
that these dissimilar characters extended vertically downwards through the

entire "Floor." Charcoal has been found in a few of them, and one con-

tained two or three bones.

At the western wall of the Arcade, and sevei'al feet from it, the Stalagmitic

Floor was never  less  than 4,  and not unfrequently upwards      of  5 feet  thick
                                                                                                       ;

but at the eastern wall it rarely measured more than 2 feet. The upper-

most  6  inches were   frequently of a dirty reddish  colour, as  if  soil-stained
                                                                                                                                   ;

but at greater depths it was very pure, often granular, occasionally flaky, and

everywhere distinctly laminated.
   At something more than a foot from the bottom of the Floor, there was

found in every section a roughly horizontal, continuous, black line, extending

from the western wall of the Arcade to a distance, in one instance, of 7 feet,

generally about a quarter of an inch thick, but never exceeding half an inch.

It was due to the presence of charcoal, and, of course, represented a thin sheet
of that material. It was very carefully watched as the Floor was broken up,

but yielded no trace of bone or of any substance besides the charred wood.
   This " Charcoal Streak" was observed and studied by Mr. MacEnery, who,

attaching great chronological importance to it, described it no less than four
times f. The portion of the Floor in which he found it was not more, at
most, than half the thickness of that recently broken up by the Committee.

From his description it appears to have been horizontal, midway from the

surface to the bottom of the stalagmite, from 1 to 2 inches thick, about 5 feet
in greatest length in any section, composed of charred wood and straw, and to

--have contained the following objects imbedded in it : Small polished pebbles

of white flint, shells, two portions of the jaw, a tusk, and some phalanges of
boar, the under jaw of a badger, bones of rabbits and rats, and cylindrical bones
which Dr. Buckland, who extracted them, assigned to deer. The latter were
half-roasted, and, with the exception of the jaws of the boar, all the bones had

been more or less exposed to the action of fire. No extraneous objects of any

kind were found in the Floor above or below the " Charcoal Streak."
   The Committee have been more fortunate, having met with bones in other

parts of the stalagmite, but all of them below the black line. The most note-
worthy of these are a tooth of deer (No. 5818), a large vertebra (No. 5951),
and a well-worn tooth of hysena (No. 5969). In the same deposit a piece
of black flint (No. 5938) was found July 18, 1872.

    Mr. MacEnery's diggings in the Cave-earth at the entrance of the Arcade
had in some places been carried to a depth of 3 feet below the Stalagmitic Floor,
thus leaving the fourth Foot-level intact. They gradually became less and less

deep, until at 12 feet from the entrance they ceased entirely. This excavated
material has been carefully reexamined, but contained very few specimens.

--46 REPORT 1873.

The deposit underlying the Stalagmitic Floor was typical Cave-earth,

having no peculiar characteristics. Up to the end of July no trace of the

Breccia (the older deposit) had presented itself, either in situ or in incorpo-

rated fragments. It has not proved to be very rich, nor has it been remark-

ably poor, in bones and teeth ; and it has yielded two flint implements. It

is believed, however, that the lack of abundance will be found to be fully

compensated by the character and value of at least one of the specimens.

One of the implements (No. 5S19) is a somewhat mottled white flint, rather

irregular in form, flat on one face, doubly carinated on the other, 3-3 inches

long, 1*1 inch in greatest breadth, and -4 inch where thickest. It was found

in the first Foot-level of Cave-earth with a portion of a grey flint nodule,

apparently fractured artificially.

The second implement (No. 5829) is a bluish-grey flint, semilunar iu out-

line, 2-5 inches long, 1-5 inch broad, and fuUy -5 inch in greatest thickness.

It was found, with a tooth of hyaena and a tooth of horse, in the third Foot-

level of Cave-earth.

Up to the end of July 120 teeth and a considerable number of bones, be-

longing to various kinds of mammals, had been met with. As the exploration

of the Arcade is not completed, it is perhaps undesirable at present to exhibit

the distribution of the teeth in a tabular form. The hyaena, us usual, takes the

lead, and is followed by the horse and the rhinoceros in tlicir usual places.

Though, amongst the animal remains, several good specimens have been

met with in the branch of the Cavei'n at present under notice, only two of
them require special mention. One of these (No. 5968) is the right lower

jaw of a young bear, and, what is very unusual in the Cavern, perfect in all

its parts. Such, however, was its fragility that it was broken in taking it
out of the deposit. It was found July 30, 1872, with an additional canine

of a young bear (in all probability belonging to the same individual) and a

tooth of elephant, in the third Foot-level of Cave-earth, over which the

Stalagmitic Floor was 5 feet thick.

The other specimen (No. 5962) is a well-marked incisor of Maehairodvs

laUdens, found July 29, 1872, with the left lower jaw of bear containing one

molar, in the first or uppermost Foot-level of Cave-earth, having over it the

Granular Stalagmitic Floor 2*5 feet thick. It answers admirably to the

--following description given by MacEnery of the incisor he found : " The

internal face of the enamel is fringed with a serrated border. This tooth is
distinguished further by two tubercles or protuberances at the base of the

enamel from which the serration springs, and describes a pointed arch on the

internal surface      The body of the tooth in this specimen is not com-

pressed but rounded " *. He adds, " Whether this belongs to an inferior

species of (J. cultridois, or [is] simply the incisor anterior to the canine of the

larger species of U. cuUndens, I am not able to pronounce with certainty. If

merely the incisor, it is stiU interesting, as it serves to show that the serrated

character is not confined to the canines, and that the rest of the teeth, and
consequently the frame, are marked by a peculiar conformation."

  A glance at the new specimen sufiices to explain why Mr. MacEnery was

uncertain respecting the canine or incisive character. Indeed the workmen

eent it to the Secretary of the Committee under the belief that it was the

canine of a wolf, it being partially covered with Cave-earth ; and its true
character was detected whilst it was being washed, August 5, 1872.

 --MacEnery states that his incisor, which unfortunately cannot be traced,

was " about an inch long"* the expression, in aU probability, of a rough

                      * Trans. Devon. Assoc, vol. iii. p. 370.

guess, and not of actual measurement. The incisor from the Cavern (doubt-

less that discovered and described by MacEnery) figured by Professor Owen

in his ' History of Eritish Fossil Slammals, &c. ' * very nearly corresponds

in size with its homologue just found. The new specimen is slightly longer
in the crown, and somewhat thicker in the fang.

   The Committee cannot but feel that their thanks, as well as those of all
palaeontologists, are due to the Committee of the Geological Section for having,
year after year from 1864 inclusive, cordially applied for a grant from the
funds of the Association for the exploration of the Cavern, to the Committee
of Recommendations for having recommended the successive applications, and
to the General Committee for having annually voted the sums applied for.
One of the hopes of the Cavern Committee, in commencing their researches,
was that they might find some traces of Machairodus. This they have never
abandoned, though year after year passed away without success ; and they
cannot but express their gratitude to the body whose patience and liberality
has enabled them to continue their labours until this \\o-^e was realized. The
greater part of this Report vras written before the discovery was made ; and
had the work ceased on July 28, 1872, those who always declined to believe
that Machairodus had ever been found in Kent's Cavern, would have been
enabled to urge, as an additional argument, the fact that the consecutive,
systematic, and careful daily labours of 7 years and 4 months had failed to

show that their scepticism was unreasonable. This great accumulation of
negative evidence has been for ever set aside, and all doubt of Mr. MacEnery's

accuracy for ever removed, by the discovery the Committee have now had the

pleasure to announce.

   They can now announce also that Machairodus latidens and man were con-

temporaries in Britain ; for even if, notwithstanding the great array of facts

to the contrary, the former should prove to have belonged to the era of the
Breccia, and not to that later time represented by the Cave-earth, the two
flint implements found in the Breccia, to which attention was called in a
previous part of this Report, as well as that produced and described at Exeter

in 1869, take man back to that earlier period also.

Report of the Committee appointed for the purpose of promoting the
   Foundation of Zoological Stations in different parts of the World.

The Committee beg leave to report that, as stated in the Report of last year,

the Zoological Station of Naples will be ready and in working order in the
beginning of January 1873, the progress of the construction being such as to
enable Dr. Dohrn to make this assertion.

   This undertaking has received much official and private assistance, not only
from public authorities, but in a very high degree from private persons. The
Committee have much pleasure in acknowledging especially the extraordinary
services rendered by Mr. W. A. Lloyd, of the Crystal-Palace Aquarium, in giving

every assistance to Dr. Dohrn, as far as technical difficulties are concerned.
    Special care has been taken to secure donations to the future library of the

Station. The eminent firm of Engelmann, in Leipzig, has presented all its works
on Biology not previously possessed by Dr. Dohrn. Vieweg, in Brunswick, has
also sent all his publications on Biology. Theodore Fischer, in Cassel, has done

48 REPORT-- 1872.

the same. Important donations are promised from Dr. Alexander Agassiz, Cam-
bridge, Mass., comprehending the publications of both his father and himself.

    To secure the development of the libraiy on a greater scale, it will be
necessary to inake general applications. For this purpose, Dr. Dohrn,
assisted by several of the greatest German publishing firms, is preparing an
appeal to all German publishers, and hopes also to succeed with a like
demand in Italy. The Committee hope that the British Association will
lend its moral assistance to a similar demand in this country, not only by
granting a complete set of its own publications, but by recommending a
similar act to other scientific' bodies and private persons.

    The Committee are further glad to announce that some Steam Navigation
Companies are prepared to grant a free passage to the Naturalists, and free
transport for the goods sent to or from the Zoological Station.

    Dr. Dohrn contemplates a new step for the purpose of securing a larger
income for the Naples Station. He is about to offer to several Governments,

Universities, and Scientific Bodies working-tables in the Laboratory of the
Station for a certain annual sum. The payment of this sum would confer
upon the subscribing Government, University, or Society the riglit of appoint-
ing naturalists, who, on presenting a certificate to the administration of the
 Station, would be furnished with a working-table and admitted to a partici-
 pation in all the other very extensive advantages of the Station.

    The Committee think it well earnestly to advocate this new step of the

 administration of the Naples Station, the more so as it lessens the burden
 of the single naturalist, enabling even such as are destitute of means to
 profit by the manifold advantages of the Station, while it guarantees a fixed
 annual income to the latter, which would be employed in improving the
 technical and other means of investigation.

Fourth Report on the Fauna of South Devon. By C. Spence Bate^ F.R.S.

 In presenting to this Association the Fourth Report of the Marine Fauna of
 the South Coast of Devon and Cornwall, it cannot be supposed that any great

 increase of novelties, either in species or genera, can be added to the forms

Myknown ; and to recapitulate those already reported is unnecessary.

 attention therefore has been directed more especially towards the develop-

 ment and habits of animals that have fallen within my range of observation.

 Facility has been given in this direction by the establishment at Plymouth,

 under my suggestion and plan, of a marine pond for the purpose of keeping

 and storing animals for the aquarium at the Crystal Palace. Already it
 has given us opportunities of observing the habits of animals that could
 scarcely be obtained under any less favourable circumstances. These oppor-
 tunities win become still more numerous and valuable as the conditions of
 the pond become more adapted to deep-sea species.

    The pond is formed out of a deep gully in the limestone shore, and much
 of it extends far into a cave beneath the cliff'. The pond is irregular in
 shape and depth, and affords many crannies, nooks, and corners for animals
 to live or take refuge in. At the entrance, where the water is deepest, the
 width of the pond is about eleven feet, but at other places it is more than
 double that extent ; and when the sea rises to the higher spring-tides the length

 of the pond extends upwards of eighty feet from the wall that separates it
 from the waters of the Sound. The rocks, which were formerly covered with

50 REPORT-- 1872.

Most of these have been confined in the pond, where they generally appear

to acclimatize themselves readily. The exceptions appear to be among those

species whose habits are of an erratic character, as the Mackerel {Scomber

scombrus). Several specimens of this species have been placed in the

pond, where the imprisonment alone seemed to operate prejudicially upon

them. They appeared to roam from point to point, seeking an outlet ; but

finding none, they one after another succumbed to their altered conditions

and died, iiut other fish not only live but thrive well, apparently having no

consciousness of any altered circumstances in their existence. These, from a

constant and close inspection, will, I hope, furnish us with opportunities of

recording notes of their habits and ways that cannot be obtained under less

favourable conditions.

The beautiful Blue Wrasse (Labrus mixtus) has already given us an

instance that is important in the history of its life, in the decided preference

it exhibits in sexual selection. It was not until it had been observed in

confinement that the Blue Wrasse and the Spotted Wrasse were known to be

one and the same species. The male is very much more rare than the female,

and is probably supposed to be more rare than it is, from the fact that those

that have been confined in the pond at Plymouth appear to be losing the

distinguishing colours and assuming that of the female as the summer time
is passing on, so that there is much reason to believe that the beautiful deep-

blue colour only exists, or at least is much more intense, during the pairing

or breeding time.

During this period the male has been seen to select its special favourite

out of a considerable number of females congregated in the pond, and faith-
fullj'^ accompany her as she swam about from place to place. In accordance

M'ith this same observation, Mr. Alford Lloyd, of the Cr3'stal-Palace Aquarium,

informed me that when at Hamburg he had noticed this peculiarity, and first
drew my attention to it. He said that having a veiy handsome specimen of

the Blue Wrasse, he placed him into a tank of water alone : instead of

conducting himself like an orderly fish and swimming quietly, he for some
time swam eagerly about in search of change ; but not finding it, he took the

unusual freak of jumping out of the tank ; this he did two or three times.

Fearing to lose him, it was determined to put another in with him ; and a
female specimen was selected. This appeared to have no very favourable suc-

cess, for the Blue Wrasse most ungallantly chased her about, and tried to drive
her from his presence. Another female was selected, with the same result.
It was then determined to place the original specimen into a tank in which

there were several swimming peacefully about, among which were many un-

selected females. Immediately the transfer was made, the animal swam

amongst the forlorn group and fixed on one, by no means the handsomest of

her sex, and selected her as his mate. With this one he was returned to his

own  tank                        and  here  he  conducted  himself  in a  peaceful  manner,  never
                              ;

attempting again to jump out of the tank in which he was confined.

   I have also to record the capture of a specimen of the Bogue (S])arus hoops,

L.), llg inches long ; when it was brought to me it was in a very beautiful

state of preservation. Of this species there have been but two or three speci-
mens taken, and these scarcely so fine as the specimen now recorded. It
was taken in a trawling-net, and brought in alive, but did not survive its

capture. The specimen is preserved in the collection of the Museum of the

Plymouth Institution.

   Mr. Brooking Rowe informs me that in July last a specimen of the German
or Long-finned Tunny (Orcynus alcdonja) was taken in the Laira estuary.
                                  ;

ON THE FAUNA OF SOUTH DEVON.  51

near Plymouth. It was 9 feet long ; the tail, from tip to tip, was 2 feet
11 inches wide; the girth 5 feet 11 inches: it weighed 800 lbs. This is,
I believe, only the fourth example mentioned as having occurred in Great

Britain.

   On the 6th of September last I had brought to me a small fish (living)

about three quarters of an inch long, of a purple-black colour, with the
exception of the caudal, posterior dorsal, and postanal fins ; these were so
transparent as not to be visible without extreme care while the animal was
in the water. The head was large, with the upper jaw slightly protruding
over the lower. The head was elevated between the eyes, and three sharp
spines were present on the postero-lateral margin, just above the gUl-cdvers
a row of small spines were visible on each side of the posterior half of
the body, and three large spines are implanted at the lower base of each
lateral fin ; but the most striking peculiaritj- of the animal exists in the large
size of the fins themselves, particularly the laterals. There are four, two
upon each side ; they are narrow at the base, where they are connected
with the animal, from which point they gradually, but rapidly, increase in
width and length, until the latter is about one third of the length of the
animal, and the former more than equal to its depth.

   An examination of its details with that of known species has led me to

the conclusion that it is a young specimen of the Grey Gurnard {Tricjla
gumardus).

                                                              Cbitstacea.

   Among the Crustacea I have as yet but little to report, some observations

on the earlier development of the Homarus having been interfered with by
the loss or robbery of some specimens that 1 had retained in special crab-
pots some fathoms under water. This has deferred the opportunity until

another season.

    There are, however, two subjects of interest that might be here alluded to.
The first is the decrease that is perceptible in the numbers of the edible
species of Crustacea. This is the more apparent in the Httoral than in the
deep-sea forms, and is likely to be more felt with the rapidly increasing
prices of articles of consumption. The circumstance no doubt arises fi-om
the custom of destroying the females as well as the males at all seasons of
the year, and of the preference given for culinary purposes to the female
lobster {Homarus marinus) when heavy with spawn. The increased value
of the animal makes it eagerly sought after by fishermen.

    But there is not even this excuse for the capture of the female crah (Cancer
pagurus). The marketable value, as compared with the male, is at least one
fifth ; this arises from the smaller size of the animal as a whole, and of their
claws in particular. But they are captured in greater numbers, and are con-
sequently wantonly destroyed, being frequently hawked about the streets for

a very few pence apiece. It appears to me that there could scarcely be any

hardship inflicted, even temporarily, upon " shell-fishermen " if they were in-
terdicted from taking the female lobster during the spawning-season, that is,
from February until May, and that of the common crab at all.

    I am aware that this suggestion is open to the remark that the lobster and

the crab are so prolific that the number of ova that each hatch in a season
 is in the former several hundred thousand, and in the latter more than a
 million at a time, and that these very large numbers would within a short
 period soon stock all the bays of our coast. To this I would reply, that in
 all those forms of life where the ova are most abundant, the development of
                                                              --
                                                                        .

that species is least in proportional quantity. This is true of crustacean

life as well as that of other forms ; and I think it worthy of consideration,
particularly by those who, as a crucial test in the theory of evolution, demand
the exposition of a series of successional forms of life ; they should remember

that of the lobster, common as it is around our coasts and in our markets,
there is not a fisherman or observant naturalist who has yet seen that
stage in its life which unites the animal as we know it with that which we
have seen it when it quits the egg ; that is, no one has seen or knows any
thing about the animal between the time when it is half an inch and the time
when it is four inches in length. That which is true of the lobster, is like-

wise true of all .the higher forms of Crustacea, excepting only that of the

common littoral or shore-crab Carcimts mcenas).
                                                                                                (
   The second circumstance that I wish to notice is one that has been eluci-

dated by obseiTation in the aquarium. I have several times observed that a

specimen of Pagurus, or soldier crab, will seize hold of the shell in which

another, generally smaller, specimen of the same species is dwelling. I

supposed that the larger animal was covetous of the shell in which the

smaller dwelt. I have seen them, as I thought, endeavour to take posses-

sion of such occupied shell, until their soft and tender body received such a

pinch from the previous possessor as compelled them hastily to retrace their

steps.

   Mr. Alford Lloyd has written in my note-book the following sentence :

" In the spring of the year, in the Hamburg Aquarium, I have seen the male

of this crab take hold of the shell in which a female is contained, and carry

her about for weeks together, grasping the thin edge of her shell (as of a

Buccinum) ; and when the female is led the male does not take awaj' the
food, as he would if a male were so fed in his vicinity."

   I would here like to state that the preservation of Crustacea by keeping
them in glycerine for a few days, and then drying them, will be found to be
a very superior plan to that of spreading them out without any preparation.

I have specimens that have been treated two or three years with glycerine

that are as flexible as a fresh crab. It will be better of course that as much

of the soft parts should be removed as possible. I have also been trying,

Aand I think with success, to preserve fish in the same way.  specimen of the

Bogue (Spants hoops, L.), taken more than two months ago, is as fresh in colour

and as flexible as when captured, excepting the eye, which was in a partially

decomposed state when jjlaced in the glycerine. I think, when further experi-

ments have confirmed the fact, that with or without admixture with another

medium, glycerine may afford a very valuable addition to the preservative

agents of our museums.

Among the MoUusca we have to record the capture of many specimens of

Eledone  . This has generally been supposed to be a rare species ou

our coast ; but we find that Octopus vulgaris, the supposed common species,

is the more difficult to obtain. Both these appear to live well and happily

in captivity ; so also does Sepia officinalis.

   Mr. Rogers, who has charge of the pond at Plymouth, and is a most active
and zealous collector of marine animals, tells me that two specimens of this

last-named cuttlefish were placed in the pond on the 8th of June, 1871
They continued doing well until the 24th, when they were seen to be in
copuM, head to head, arms interlaced, and remaining stationarj-, resting on

the bottom for about twelve minutes, then separating. On the 26th the
male was killed by a dog, which seized it when in shallow water. These

creatures were rarely seen far apart, usually following each other in every
                                 ,

direction, swimming with equal ease either backward or forward ; they were
never seen to feed, but always appeared to be in search of food, after the manner
of the Wrasses, moving slowly round the sides of the pond and rocks, thrust-
ing their heads into holes and crevices : when disturbed, they darted through

the water with great swiftness.

   The female died on the 6th of July, and on being opened was found to be
in very good condition, and to contain a large quantity of ova.

   I have been taking steps to have within the cave behind the pond a case
with a glass front so constructed as to enable us to watch the habits of
animals with the greatest care. The water in this pond is several degrees
lower in temperature than that in the tanks of the Crystal-Palace Aquarium,
a circumstance that wUl enable us to study marine life under still more
natural conditions. I believe that students of marine life wiU find this pond
to be a valuable instrument for the carrying out of prolonged researches
in the examination of structure or the development of animals ; and they will
find in the keeper an ever willing and obliging assistant and cooperator.

    I cannot close this Report without expressing great regret at the loss

of our old friend and fellow naturalist, Jonathan Couch, of Polpcrro. He

was a close observer and zealous lover of nature, and only wanted the advan-
tages of a less secluded life to have placed him among the foremost of our

naturalists. He died at a ripe old age, and, 1 am sorry to say, has left a
widow and three children in the greatest straits of poverty, to assist whom

would be a kind and generous testimony to a long and well-spent life.

Preliminary Report of the Committee appointed to construct and print

 --Catalogues of Spectral Rays arranged upon a scale of Wave-numbers*
       the Committee consisting of Dr. Huggins, Mr. Lockyer, Professor
   Reynolds, Professor Swan, and Mr. Stoney (Reporter).

The reference of spectral lines to a standard scale of wave-numbers, instead

of to a scale of the wave-lengths in air of a given pressure and temperature,
or to any of the other scales in use, has very marked advantages. The scale
of wave-numbers furnishes to the theoretical inquirer the ratios between wave-
lengths, which are what he chiefly wants, in the simplest and most conspi-
cuous form, since a series of rays of which the wave-lengths are in geome-

trical proportion will be represented by equidistant lines upon the map. No
person who has not encountered the task can conceive how tedious it is to
carry on a theoretical investigation with any other scale. And to the observer

the scale of wave-numbers offers the advantages which have been well stated

--by Professor C. A. Young in the following words : " An accurate chart of

the solar spectrum on which the lines should be mapped according to ' inverse
wave-length,' proposed by Captain Herschel himself, I believe, as well as by
Mr. Stoney and others, would sufficiently resemble the spectrum seen in a

spectroscope to be equally convenient in the observatory with that of Kireh-
hoff, and would be free from the reproach of arbitrariness and irregularity
in its sciile. Such a chart would be most gladly welcomed by aUgSpectrosco-
pists, and would immediately supersede those of Kirchhoff and Angstrom."

(See a letter from Professor Young in ' Nature' of the 6th June, 1872.)

   * The term wave-numbers appears preferable to the equivalent term " inverse wave-
lengths " which has been hitherto used.
--54 REPORT 1872.

   Accordingly, your Committee decided on reducing to wave-numbers all the
wave-lengths, whether of solar lines or of the rays of incandescent vapours,
which have been determined with sufficient precision. Mr. Charles E. Burton
has offered his services gratuitously for making the necessary reductions, and
has made considerable progress with the solar spectrum, the greater part of
which is now nearly ready for the press.

  A specimen of the catalogue of solar lines is appended to this Eeport,

containing the lines from E to b. It is intended that this catalogue shall

--contain in a compact form all the most useful information that is ^ available,

viz. : References to the position of each line on Eirchhoff's and Angstrom's
maps, details of the process by which the standard wave-numbers have been
deduced, and indications of the intensitj', width, and origin of each ray
wherever these have been determined*. The rays will, moreover, be
bracketed into the groups which strike the eye in looking at the spectrum,
and a number will be assigned to each group which wUl sufficiently indicate
its position on the standard scale.

   Your Committee have as yet only incurred an expenditure of £4 for books,

maps, and preliminary printing. This leaves a balance of .£16 in their hands

out of the grant of £20 placed at their disposal last year.
   It is estimated that the two catalogues which the Committee propose to

publish (the Catalogue of the Principal Lines of the Solar Spectrum, and the
Catalogue of Rays of Incandescent Vapours) wUl cost about =£60. This does
not include the cost of the charts, which ought to accompany the catalogues

in order to render them complete. The charts would increase the entire sum
to be expended, including the grant already made, to about £120 ; but a
portion of this sum would return to the Association in the form of the pro-

ceeds from the sale of the catalogues and charts.
   Your Committee think that they could render the second catalogue more

perfect if they were in a position to employ a competent person to revise and

therefore suggest that this revision be made a part of their functions, and
that an addition of £50 be made to the grant for this purpose. This woiild

increase the sum to be granted this year to £150.
   The Committee accordingly recommend that they be reappointed, and that

this sum be placed at their disposal, in addition to the balance at present in

their hands.

Third Report of the Committee ap^minted to consider and report on the

    various Plans jjroposed for Legislating on the subject of Steam-Boiler

 --Explosions with a vieiv to their Prevention^ the Committee con-

   sisting of Sir William Fairbairn, Bart., C.E., F.R.S., &^c., John

  Penn, C.£.,F./?.>S'., Frederick J. ]3ramwell, C.E., Hugh Mason,

"SVuEN the Committee presented their last Heport oa the subject nf " Steam-
Boilcr Legislation" to the Meeting of the Eritish Association held at Edin-
burgh, it was fully expected that the measure, having for its object the pre-
vention of Steam-Boiler Explosions, which Avas tlieu before Parliament,

having been introduced by John Hick, Esq., Member for Bolton, as the

result of the inquiry bj' the Parliamentary Committee which sat upon this

--subject during tlie Sessions of 1S70-71 it was fully expected that this

measure would by this time not only have passed througli Parliament, but
also have been in active operation, so that some practical results might have
been arrived at. Such, however, has not proved to be the case. The Bill,

though read a first time in the House of Commons late in the Session of 1871,

and reintroduced this year as early as the 7th of March, has not yet passed
a second reading, having been postponed from time to time. It was thought

better to wait the maturity of Mr. Hick's Bill before assembling the Com-

mittee for consultation ; but this course, though considered advisable, has,
owing to the delay just referred to in the progress of the Bill, prevented the
Committee completing their report for presentation at this Meeting of the
British Association. Under these circumstances they request an extension of

time, and suggest their reappointment for another year, when they hope to

complete the task assigned them.

Report of the Committee, consisting of James Glaisher, F.R.S., of the
   Royal Observatory , Greenwich, Uobert P. Greg, F.R.S., Alex-
   ander S. IIerschel, F.R.A.S., and Charles Brooke, F.R.S.,

   Secretary to the Meteorological Society, on Observations of Lumi-

  %nous Meteors, 1871-72; drawn up Alexander S, Herschel,

   F.R.A.S.

AMO^'G the objects whose special promotion it was suggested in the last Report

that the Committee would undertake by combined observations during the past

year, the attention of observers at several stations in Scotland and England

well used to accurate and systematic registry of shooting-stars was, as in

former years, frequently not unsuccessfully directed, at the request of the Com-

mittee, towards recording the appearances of shooting-stars visible ou the

annually recurring meteoric dates in Augnst, October, November, December,

January, and April.

The August meteors were somewhat more brightly visible last year than

commonly, on the two successive nights of the 10th and 11th of August, and

the clearness and darkness of the sky enabled a more than ordinarily largo

number of meteors to be carefully observed. From a long list of meteor-paths

1872.                                     1-
--58 REPORT 1872.

recorded both at the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, and by the observers for

the British Association, the heights of twenty meteors of the shower visible
on the different nights of its reappearance were calculated, and several other
meteors were identified as having been doubly observed whose real paths have
not yet been computed. The position of the radiant-point of the shower * was
found to be, as recently pointed out by Mr. Hind in a letter in ' The Times ' of
August 8th, more northerly tban hitherto, at a point in R. A. 35°, N. Decl. 59°,

three or four degrees north-westwards from ^ Persei towards i Cassiopeios.

  A few meteors of the October shower were visible on the 19th of October

last ; but the sky being overcast, with stormy weather, on other nights of the

shower, the time and rate of frequency of their fall at the maximum intensity

of the shower could not be ascertained; and from the few recorded meteor-
tracks only a roughly approximate position of its radiant-point was obtained.

   The condition of the sky was generally little more favourable for observa-
tions in November and December than in October ; but on the morning of
the 13th of November a clear view of the Leonids was obtained both at
Stonyhurst College and at the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, while on another
following morning, that of the 15th of November, they were also well seen
by Professor Herschel at Newcastle-upon-Tyne ; and their abundance on the
latter date was considerably greater than that of the unconformable meteors
from all parts Avhich appeared at the same time with them. The distribution of
the November meteor-group along the ring which forms its orbit being at pre-
sent unknown, the watch for the return of the Leonids this year will be renewed

for the purpose of comparative observations of their greatest rate of frequency

in successive years. No accordant observations of single meteors appear to have
been recorded either during the October or November star-showers.

   At most of the corresponding places a clear view of the December sliooting-
stars was obtained on the night of the 12th, while the sky was everywhere

completely overcast on the 13th. Meteors appeared at the rate of ten or
twelve per hour for one observer from the direction of Gemini ; and the posi-
tion of the radiant-point in this constellation could be pretty correctly ascer-

tained by the meteor-tracks recorded on the night when they were principally
observed. This appears, as in former years, to have been near 6 Geminorum,

   On the night of the 2ud of January a favourable state of the sky permitted

a considerable display of the January meteors to be seen at several of the
corresponding stations, and to be simultaneously recorded at the Eoyal
Observatory, Greenwich. The star-shower continued with about equal
brightness until daybreak on the morning of the 3rd of January ; but a cloudy
sky on the night of the 3rd everywhere prevented the close or a continuation
of the shower from being seen. In this and the December meteor observations
several cxami:)les of doubly observed shooting-stars were found, of which, with
those of some other similar observations contained in these descriptions of the
meteor- showers of the past year, the heights wiU be immediately calculated.
The radiant-point of the January star-shower appears not to have altered its
place sensibly in the interval since its last principal appearance in England
on the 2nd of January, lS64t.

    The last meteoric shower of the past year which was successfully watched
for by the observers was that of April 19th, 1872, when a few conspicuous
meteors, radiating from the direction of Lyra, were recorded at nearly all the
stations, and also at the Eoyal Observatory at Greenwich, and, under the direc-

    * Which appears, from the few observations of the shower on the 9th and 10th inst.

(August 1S72), to have very nearly maintained the same position in the present year,

tion of tlie Rev. E,. Main, by Mr. Lucas at the EadcliiFe Observatory at
Oxford. The watch at the latter place was contiuucd during the night of the
] 9-20th of April until the morning hours, and the Lyraids continued to be
more and more abundant until daybreak. The position of the radiant-point
was close to that found in the former observations of 1864*. The prevalence of
some other radiant-points of shooting-stars chiefly producing, it appears, bright

meteors during the months of March, April, and May was discernible ; and the

heights of two bright meteors from different radiant-points that appeared on
the night of the 19th of April will be approximately obtained from double and
triple observations of their apparent paths which were then recorded.

    The heights of some large meteors seen on other nights of the year have
also been determined with some certainty from corresponding observations of
them at distant places, of which a short description is given, with that of the
principal observations from which they are derived. Large meteors have been
seen in more than ordinary numbers during the past year ; and the informa-
tion respecting several of these meteors which has been received by the Com-
mittee is included in a general list in continuation of some former notes of
meteors of the largest class. But two aerolites appear to have fallen during
the years 1871-72 ; the first at Searsmont, in the United States, on the 21st
of May, 1871, and the second in November, 1871, at Montereau, in France.

    At the conclusion of the lleport the contribution of some recent valuable
additions to meteoric literature by the ItaHan astronomers and observers of
shooting-stars, Prof. Schiaparelli and Signer Denza, in combination with a
weU-known representative of meteoric science in Germany, Dr. G. von
Boguslawski, is briefly noticed and described ; and in the last place a long
list of radiant-points placed in comparison with each other in a single Table
by Mr. Greg at the close of this Eeport, forms a complete comparative index f
of the epochs and positions of all the meteoric showers included in the

general lists hitherto published for the northern hemisphere.

   Great improvements of this Table wiU, it cannot be doubted, be made by
reducing the many meteor-tracks, of which, since the appearance of the last
printed meteor- catalogue in these Eeports, a large number of descriptions have
been received. To enable them to accomplish this undertaking, the continu-
ation of the Committee's operations, and of a grant to support them in execu-
ting charts and tracings, is earnestly recommended to the British Association.
The watchfulness of observers on every fine night when favourable opportu-

nities present themselves for recording the occasional appearances of shooting-

stars, in order to contribute fresh materials for the same purpose, is once more
appealed to, in addition to the nights of annual recurrence of meteor-showers,
of which, as before, due notice will be regularly communicated to them by the
Committee, and suitable means will be furnished to them to enable them to assist
these objects by their observations, to which their attention will again be in-

vited at the returns of the several meteoric epochs, as in former years.

I. Meteoks doublt obseeved.

Among the meteors observed during the simultaneous watch for the annual

meteor-shower of August, December, Januarj^, and April, in 1871 and 1872,

several accordant observations of individual meteors were found, enabling

Atheir real heights to be satisfactorily ascertained.  list of such accordances

courses with the brightest ncighbouriug fixed stars, to overstate rather than

to underrate the apparent length of their visible flights, will perhaps account

for the excessive real velocity of the Perseids obtained in these results of the

simultaneous observations. The velocity of a single meteor of the shower,
as bright as Sirius (the first meteor shown in the diagram), unconformable
to Perseus, and directed from the radiant-point in Pegasus, was somewhat
more exactly obtained, both its apparent path and its duration being very

carefully observed by 'Mr. Wood at Eirmingham and Mr. Clark at York,

whose observations were in excellent agreement. The real length of the path
of this meteor was 38 miles, and its resulting real velocity was 19 miles

per second.

   On comparing together the observations of the shooting- stars recorded at

Greenwich with those seen at the British-Associatiou stations during the
same August shower, several perfcctlj- accordant observations were found on

the night of the 11th; and but few satisfactory identifications of meteors

doubly observed on the night of the 10th of August, excepting that of the
brightest (at 10'' 51" p.m., as noticed in the following descriptions of the
shower), could be detected. The following list contains a general description

of the various shooting-stars which appear to have been doubly observed at

the Eojal Observatory, Greenwich (and by the observers at other stations), on
the night of the 11th of August, and on the other nights of simultaneous watch
kept for the reappearance of the annual meteor-showers which have been

visible during the past year.

  A few double observations of shooting-stars are also contained in the accom-

panying list of bright meteors, and in the detailed accounts which will shortly
be given of the observations of the meteoric showers. The meteor No. 7,
whose real height is figured in the above diagram from observations at York,
at Hawkhurst, and in London, was also seen at the Eoyal Observatorj',
Greenwich, and its apparent path was there recorded at ll*" 14TM 59" r.Ji.
on the 11th of August. The redetermination of the real height of this

meteor by comparison of the new observation with the former ones, and the

computation of the several meteor-heights to be derived from the additional
observations contained, in this Eeport, will afibrd interesting materials for

 future consideration.

    The last meteor in the accompanying list, on the 19th of April last, wiU be
seen to have been triply observed at York, Wisbeach, and Hawkhurst. The
heights determined from the observations at the first two places are 66 miles
at first appearance, and 41 miles at disappearance. But if the observation at
Hawkhurst is correct, the meteor probably moved at an elevation of not more
 than 50 or 55 miles at first appearance and 30 or 35 miles at disappearance.
From the former observations the length of its visible path was 90 miles ; but
 in the latter case it woiild not exceed 70 miles ; and if the observations at York
 and Hawkhurst only are employed, as affording the widest parallax, it would
 be somewhat less. The duration of its flight was probably underestimated at
 York at half a second, and overestimated at Wisbeach at 3 seconds. The ave-
 rage duration is 1| second, giving the probable velocity of the meteor not more
 than 40 miles per second ; while the actual velocity of the LyraVds, calculated
 from the astronomical theory of the great April meteor-group, is 30 miles per
 second. The recorded paths of this member of the shower diverged very ex-
 actly from a common radiant-point between it and 6 Herculis, aboiit 20° from

 the usually observed centre of divergence of the meteor-group in Lyra.
     The estimated height of a bright meteor seen on the 31st of August last

 was also obtained from accordant observations of its apparent path at Boss

   In addition to the occurrences of this kind of whose appearance accounts
were received by tlic Committee since their last E-eport, the following list

and in the last third part of this portion of the meteor's flight, its nucleus
was plainly yisible, of intense whiteness and brilliancy at the centre, and
surrounded with duller red light to-«-ards the border, which -was of the same
·v\adth as the smoke-^wreath. It became extinguished at h, and from this
point to c three more small cloud triangles, like those first formed, VN'ere
added in quick succession to its length. The earlier portions of the smoke-
·wreath had by this time entirely disappeared, the meteor taking not more
than three or four seconds to produce the cloud column, which was also the
time taken by this part of the smoke-wreath and by each of the cloud
triangles to disappear ; so that the whole diu'ation of visibility of the pheno-
menon was about fifteen seconds. Immediately after its disappearance, the
blue sky at that place remained as clear and as bright as it had been before
the meteor's passage. The cloud-substance of the triangles first formed was
bluish white, like the smoke of gunpowder, while that in the upper part of

the smoke-column became quite dark as it disappeared. By marking the

first and last points of the meteor's course (a, c) with reference to the
houses of a neighbouring street, and pacing their distance from his point of

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.            G9

   2. In the ' Standard' of September 15, 18G9, Mr. F. P. Bullock describes
a remarkably bright meteor, which he saw at Cheltenham, at 10'' 8TM p.m., on

the 12th of that month, passing rapidly, and with an extraordinary long

course, over a complete quarter of the sky.

3. The following observations of rather bright meteors were communi-

cated, with some of lesser magnitude noted during previous years, by Mr.

--AJ. E. Clark :--                        meteor about }r of the apparent size
   1869, September 20, 6^ 46"" p.m.

of the moon was seen by Mr. A. K. Brown, Mr. S. P. Thomson, and by other

observers, at Dcnbydale, near Huddersfield, of pale yellow light, apparently

not much stronger than that of Saturn, and changing to red. It fell about

15° in 2| seconds, nearly vertically, to a point about 15° above the east

horizon, followed by a streak or tail of sparks, which became redder, like the

nucleus, towards the end of its coui'se.

1869, December 21, &" 15"' p.m.--Near Leominster, Mr, J. E. Southall

observed a meteor of j-ellow colour, and of about the greatest brilliancy of

the planet Yenus, descending vertically 12^^° in half a second from a point in

B. A. 97°, S. Decl. 7°, to 11. A. 80°, S. Decl. 18°. The meteor was visible

through light clouds, which obscured the view of any streak or sparks which

may have accompanied it in its course.

4. At a meeting of the Natural History and Philosophical Society of

Derry, in Ireland, on March 4, 1870, Mr. William Harte described some

observations of a remarkable meteor which passed over Donegal on the night

of the 27th of December 1809.

 --5. 1870, July 25, evening. Soon after dark, a brilliant meteor was

observed in Kent and at other places near the English Channel. At Dover

it was seen to rise almost perpendicularly from the sea horizon in the east,

increasing in splendour until it disappeared overhead. The fii'st effect of its

very striking and unusual upward course was to produce an irresistible

impression that it was a signal rocket or other artificial light fired from some

distant vessel on the sea. Some current descriptions of this fireball, which

appeared in the daily journals at the time, have unfortunately escaped the

notice of the Committee.

0. On the 16th of October, 1870, descriptions of two bright meteors

received by the Committee appear to indicate some close connexion from

their resemblance, although, from their recorded positions and from a slight

interval between their times of appearance, they appear to be distinct. The

first, which appeared to Mr. J. E. Clark and Mr. S. Giles, at York, at
8'' 25TM P.M., of red colour, increasing from the apparent brightness of a

foiirth-magnitiide star to that of Venus, described a short course of 8° or 9°

in three or four seconds, from a point in B. A. 22°, 'N. Decl. 20°, to B. A. 34°,

N. Decl. 16°, leaving a few sparks, but no visible streak upon its course.

At 8*" 28'" P.M., on the same evening, a meteor bi'igbter than a first-magni-

tude star, and in every other respect of perfectly similar description with

that observed at York, was seen by Mr. William Marriott, at Greenwich,

describing, in the same time, an apparent course of the same length, in the

northern sky, from the star 4" towards the star a in Draco. The meteor seen

at York appeared in the south-east, at such a considerable distance from the

direction indicated by the Greenwich observations as to admit of no possible

consideration of their identity by the supposition of ordinary errors of obser-

vation. But the remarkable resemblance of their descriptions and their

nearly simultaneous appearance, if not attributable to the earth's passage at

the time through a common meteor-system, is yet a very similar occurrence
70 REPORT-- 1872.

to the pairs and groups of meteors which are sometimes observed to appear
in very brief succession in ordinary star-showers. The radiant-point of the

pair, if these meteors might be so regarded, is between the constellations

Cygnns and Vulpccula. But from their close vicinity, respectively, to the

radiants E3 and J3G-,,, in Musca, and in the neighbourhood of Draco, which
first present themselves about the middle of October, it appears more probable

that their remarkably foreshortened courses may be clearly individualized as

distinct, and that they were evidently members, respectively, of those well-

Amarked, and widely separated showers.   similar instance of coincidence,

but apparently without real connexion, will shortly be noticed in a future

page.

   7. Another bright meteor, from one of the latter radiant-points, II3, was
recorded by Mr. Wood, at Birmingham, at 10'* 7" p.m. on the 1st of Novem-

ber 1870; brighter than Sirius, white, and moving for two seconds in a

short course close to the apparent place of the last meteor seen at York,
from E. A. 27°, N. Decl. 21°, to y Arictis. At 10" 27'" a second-magnitude
meteor, with a vcrj' short coi;rse, passed, leaving a streak across the Pleiades,

proceeding from the same radiant-point, from which a few other meteors,

noticed by Mr. Wood on that night, were also directed. In a note to th'e

latter appearance, he observes that " a writer in the * Times,' of about that

date, describes an ' Astronomical Phenomenon,' which was ' a sudden light-
ing of the Pleiades of momentary duration,' and which took place twice on

the same night. I observed the same effect produced by this meteor ; and it

is evidently owing to the proximity of the radiant E^ to the Pleiades,

causing the meteors to be seen foreshortened when they happen to present

themselves in the position named."

       Large Meteors ohserved since the presentation of tlie last Report.

1871, August 13, 8" SO"- r.ii.--In a letter to Mr. Glaisher, Mr. W. J.

--Miller communicates the following observation of a fireball seen by him in

August last at Glasgow : " On the 13th inst., about 8** 30TM p.m., I observed,

about due north from the western part of this city, a meteor making a nearly

vertical descent ; it tended sHghtly westwards. The elevation might be about

25° or 30° ; and the twilight was still strong. The effect on the eye was

more of a flash of lightning, or the sudden appearance of the new moon, than

any thing I can compare it to. The sky being clear, there could be no

lightning of this description."

  --1871, August 21, about 9'' p.m. The following description of a large

meteor seen at Knocklong, Limerick, was communicated to the Committee by

--Mr. W. F. Denning in a letter from the observer, Mr. Jeremiah Henly, who

writes : " The meteor was visible a few minutes after 9 o'clock. It seemed

to issue from about Polaris, and travelled across the heavens for a space of

at least 7° or 8° [? 70° or 80°] in the direction of the constellation Hercules.

As it passed through the atmosphere, it seemed to leave a brilliant track of

fire across the heavens, which continued visible for about ten seconds."
--A1871, August 31, about 9'' 45"' p.m.
                                         meteor of very remarkable ap-

pearance was simultaneously observed at Hawkhurst (Kent) aiid at Eoss

(Herefordshire) under very favourable circumstances for determining its real

height. The attention of a lady. Miss Strong, who observed the meteor near

Eoss, being directed, when it appeared, to the unclouded appearance of the full

moon, which had then risen some 15° above the E.S.E. horizon ; of a suddeu

nosity, issuing, apparently, from close behind and from the centre of the moon's

side. From this point of first appearance it glided  Meteor.  Thej^on.

slowly eastward, leaving on its track a train of

gold-coloured sparks as broad and bright and

compact, apparently, as the nucleus which it pur-

sued. After advancing for a considerable space

the nucleus disappeared instantaneously, as if it

were suddenly extinguished ; and the sweeping portion of the train nearest

to the moon broke into separate sparks, while the train, along its whole

length, lay scattered along the sky like sparkling dust, which quickly faded

away. In the absence of any neighbouring stars, which were then only

beginning to glimmer faintly in the evening light, no more exact description

of its apparent course, after leaving the moon's side, could be successfully

attempted.

  A complete view of the meteor from its point of commencement, in a

cloudless sky, was also obtained by Professor Herschel at Hawkhurst, in

Kent, where it passed across the sky, at a considerable elevation, and with a

long and brilliant course, at about 9'' 44"" p.m. In the first portion of its

flight, which commenced close to the stars q, r Yulpeculaj, it increased from
the brightness of a first-magnitude star to that of Sirius ; and thence, while

passing near the star i^ Cygni, it was accompanied on its course as far as the

star ju Pegasi by a uniform and compact train of yellow sparks, of nearly the

same brightness, and of twice the apparent diameter of the nucleus. The

brightness of the meteor, in this part of its course, was but little less, and it

at length exceeded that of the planet Venus at its greatest brilliancy, while

its head was of the same yellow colour as the wide track of light which

formed its train. At the latter point the bright nucleus disappeared, and

the luminoiis train of sparks ceased, while a small spark, about as bright as
a fourth-magnitude star, with intermittent light, could be traced pursuing its
course about 8° or 9° further, to a point about 2° below the star v Pegasi,

where it finally disappeared. The meteor moved over its whole apparent
course of 40° in six seconds ; and the bright belt of light, about 6' in
apparent width and 20° in length, which remained on its track, was visible
for three or four seconds afterwards, resolving itself into small sparks, which
appeared to move forwards along the streak in the direction in which the
meteor had advanced. The perfect continuity of the long train of sparks, its
little inferior brightness, similar golden-yellow colour, and general resem-
blance to the head, which it enclosed so completely on both sides as to
exceed it considerably in width, and the steady forward motion of the meteor,
caused it to strikingly resemble the sudden and horizontal discharge of a
distant rocket. Such features of special interest in its appearance will, it may
be hoped, from its brightness, and from the clearness of the sky on that even-
ing, have attracted the attention of observers at other places, besides the two
widely distant points of observation here recorded, at which its appearance

 and the position of its apparent path in the heavens were noted under the
 most favourable conditions.

    The point of commencement of the meteor's course is found with consider-
 able certainty, from the two foregoing observations, to have been situated at
 a height of 44 miles above the sea, over a point in Pevensey Bay, about 6
miles from the Sussex coast. The real course of the meteor from this point
was, nearly, from due Avest to due east, with a very slight inclination to the
horizon ; or that direction of its real flight is most nearly accordant with the
observations. The point of disapi^earanee of the small spark which advanced
furthest along its flight was, hence, at a little lower elevation, of about 40
miles above the sea, close to the French coast, near Boulogne. Assuming
that the moon's apparent place at Ross was exactly upon the apparent course
of the meteor, which appears to be really signified b}'^ the remarkable obser-
vation that, as seen from that locality, the meteor appeared to issue from
close behind the moon, the agreement of this point with that of the meteor's
first appearance, as observed at Hawkhurst, in a gi-aphical point of view, is so
accurate and precise, that the real position of this point of the meteor's

course, as above determined, may be satisfactorily assumed, without any
material corrections, as being substantially correct. On the other hand,

admitting that, for the purpose of calculation, the description of the remaining
portion of the meteor's apparent course, as observed at Ross, is obviously
incomplete, the narrow limits between which (conformably to the rough notes
and sketches of its appearance there, and to the remaining portion of its
apparent track as mapped at Hawkhurst) the meteor can be supposed to have
moved, allows a very important conclusion to be drawn from a complete
examination of the remaining materials which were recorded concerning its
appai'ent course. If not exactly in the true west point of the horizon, the
apparent radiant-point from which the meteor was directed can yet not have
been far removed (not exceeding about 20°) southwards from this point, nor
at any great elevation (not exceeding about 30°) above the western horizon,
and it proceeded appai'cntly from the radiant Q^, near j3 Herculis, chiefly con-
spicuous in August ; so that the direction of its real course relatively to
the earth did not differ greatly (not more than 45) from that of the earth's

real motion in its orbit at the time when the meteor appeared, which was
nearly from the S.W. point of the horizon. The greatest length which can

be assigned to the meteor's real path is rather less than 42 miles, derived
from the supposition, as above assumed, that the meteor's real course was
almost horizontal and almost exactly directed from the west. But if the
meteor's real path was more inclined than this, it must also have been
shorter (and with the above extreme inclination, which it might be possible
to assign to it from the observations, its length would not exceed 33 miles*).
As the whole duration of the meteor's flight, observed at Hawkhurst, was
six seconds well counted while the meteor was in sight, the real velocity of

its motion cannot have much exceeded seven miles per second ; and under
certain possible assumptions of its apparent course at Ross, it may even have
been less than this, or the meteor may have travelled with a real speed of
only 5| miles per second. While the average real velocity of shooting-stars

to have descended obliquely at an angle of 45° with the horizon, towards the left. The
drawings represent the meteor as slightly ascending, rather than descending ; and it is
described as advancing a considerable space, and producing a luminous train of some
length, after leaving the moon's side. This representation of the meteor's appnreiit
course at Eoss, when compared with the Ilawldiurst observation, agrees exactly with a
perfectly horizontal real course, directed from about 4^ south from west.

relatively to the earth is fully 30 miles per second, it follows that in this
case, where the meteor was evidently overtaking the earth, moving nearly in
the same direction with it, its real velocity in space must have exceeded that

of the earth's motion in its orbit by not much more than 7 miles per second.
The excess of the velocity of a meteor overtaking the earth directly in a para-
bolic orbit, above that of the earth's mean motion in its own nearly circular
orbit, is found by Dr. Weiss to be about 9| miles per second*.

   The following letter in ' Nature,' May 16, 1872, from Mr. G. C. Thomson,

at Cardiff, affords another instance of bright meteors noted during the past
year, the real course of which appears to have not differed greatly in their

--direction from that of the earth's motion in its orbit, at the time of their

appearance: "I observed a meteor at about half-past eleven on the night

of the 8th inst., in the constellation Scorpio, which passed very close to the

star Antares, travelling from right to left. It appears to me worth remark-

ing, from the fact of its course lying very near and roughly parallel to that
part of the ecliptic which corresponded to the earth's position in her orbit.
It traversed some 8° or 10° of arc, and was visible for three or four seconds,
gradually increasing in brightness until it was nearly on a par with Antares,
which star it also resembled in colour. Its slow apparent motion imme-
diately suggested the idea that it was moving in the same plane and direction
as the earth, in fact that it was overtaking us in an orbit just outside our
own. The course of another meteor seen about half an hour earlier from a

westerly window, and described to me as not inferior to Jupiter in brightness,

appears also to have lain in the direction of the ecliptic, but from left to
right, in the neighbourhood of the constellations Gemini, Cancer, or Leo.
It is rash to generalize from insufficient data ; but I conceive these meteors

may both have belonged to a system whose orbit lies nearly in the j^lane of
the earth's orbit, the apparent retrograde motion of the last named being

caused by the direction of its path crossing our orbit at a point behind the
earth's then place, instead of in advance of it." The two meteors here noticed
appear to have belonged to the meteor-system denoted by the radiant-point
Y, presenting itself during the first half of May, near the centre of the con-
stellation Leo, and scarcely more than 20° distant from the point in the
ecliptic from which the earth's motion is directed during the early portion of
that month. The apparent motion of the two meteors in opposite directions
(in the former case moving eastwards towards Scorpius, and in the latter
case westwards towards the constellations Gemini and Cancer) is most
readily explained by the effect of perspective upon their, probably, not far
from really parallel courses, joined with the circumstance that in their
appearance above the observer's horizon, at Cardiff, the meteors successively

presented themselves upon opposite sides of their common radiant-point.

In relation to the probable positions of their apparent radiant-centres, both

* As a convenient means of exactly estimating the vei-y short intervals of time occupied

by meteors in their flight, it may be suggested to observers to repeat the English alpha-

bet (or as many letters of it as are required, rapidly and distinctly) immediately after the

meteor's appearance. With ordinary fluency of pronunciation one alphabet occupies

about four seconds, and fifteen alphabets can usually be repeated in one minute, the time

occupied by a single syllable, or by one letter of the alphabet, wlien thus repeated, being

about one-sixth part of a second. By beginning the repetition during or immediately after

the meteor's passage, and continuing it during an equal period of time to that in which it

appeared to move, a pretty exact estimate of the interval may thus be obtained from

memory. In ordinary oases (where the time of the meteor's passage does not allow more

than five or six letters of the alphabet to be repeated) the observation may be repeated

once or twice, and by counting the number of letters, in each case, a more exact average

determination, amounting generally to a very close approximation, may be obtained.

some bright meteors, proceeding apparently from different radiant-points
from that in Hercules of the meteor last described, were noticed, and the
following was recorded by Mr. J. M. Wilson*, as it appeared to him on the
above evening, in the fading twilight, and Avith a slightly clouded sky, and
to other persons at Croakbourne, in the Isle of Man. The meteor appeared
in the west, and presented a visible disk of about the apparent size of an
eighth of the moon's surface. As it increased in size, the nucleus broke into
three following and connected portions, the foremost and brightest of which
was white ; and a luminous streak remained for about one second upon the
meteor's course. It moved for two or three seconds, with a slow and uniform
motion, over a space of about 45°, descending nearly vertically in the west,

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.                      75

--at Bristol wns received from Mr. William F. Denning : " On September 4

I noticed several shooting- stars that were quite conspicuous. At 9^ 40TM one

passed slowly down from the N.E. to the north horizon. It was of globular

form, and seemed to leave sparks in its flight. No train of light marked its

path. This was the most brilliant one that I saw, and was equal, I imngine,

to a star of the first magnitude." On the 10th of September, 1871, at

V 4TM P.M., a very brilliant meteor was also seen, while the daylight was yet

too strong for any stars to be visible, by Mr. S. J. Johnson, at Upton Helions,

near Crediton, in Devonshire, and by several other persons in that vicinity.

It described, in about five seconds, a course of 15°, from an altitude of

about 25° to an altitude of about 10° above the south horizon.

  A large meteor is stated, in the ' Madras Times,' to have been observed at

Trevandrum, in India, on the night of the 21st of October, 1871, which

crossed the sky from the north, with rapid speed, in about four seconds,

moving at an altitude of 35° or 40°*.

intensely white, with a border of purple light, and it finally burst into several

fragments, which appeared as very white sparks, advancing further upon the

meteor's course, and speedily becoming red. The fragments disappeared from

view behind the smoke of a neighbouring colliery, the noise of whose engines,

close at hand, prevented the sound of a report, if any followed the meteor's

explosion, from being heard.

suddenly (if it was not hidden by the branches of some neighbouring trees)

at an apparent altitude of about 12° or 15° (as measured afterwards by the

elevation of the trees) from the horizon. Its point of disappearance was

about 8° or 10° below a point between the stars p and c Ononis. Its path
was slightly curved, as shown in the figure, and directed, in the latter portion

of its flight, very nearly from the Pleiades.

Mr. S. H. Miller observed the appearance of the meteor near Wisbeach in

Cambridgeshire, its light causing him to turn round and to note it in the last

portion of its flight. In apparent size it appeared to be about one-third of

the apparent diameter of the moon, perfectly white, like a drop of liquid

silver, falling in the west, where it descended "to the horizon.

At Northwich, in Cheshire, it appeared to cast as much light as the moon

shining brightly in its first quarter. It shot from the direction of the

Hyades, near Aldcbaran, and disappeared close to Orion's belt (Manchester

' Examiner and Times '). It also attracted attention at Bowdon near Man-

chester, where it was observed in the south-west, descending towards the

S.S.E. horizon. It was at first accompanied by a reddish train, which changed

to blue and left some sparks, when the meteor, with a dip southwards, sud-

denly disappeared. As seen at Bolton, near this point, by Mr. A. Greg, it

appeared facing him (and to another observer, " low down in the sky " before

him) as he looked towards the south                                                                                                                                                                                        and it disappeared in a large and bril-

last by Lord llossc :

of Lepus, whence it moved with a slow and steady motion across the heavens

to the S.E. horizon, where it gradually disappeared in a bank of cloud at
about 9'' 5"' 19^ Greenwich mean time, having occupied 7 or 8 seconds in

been as great as the moon at quadrature. Apparent diameter of the head 42'.

It was followed by a very narrow tail about 3° in length, and of a reddish

hue. It did not leave any phosphorescent train behind it ; but at the latter
part of its course it threw out some reddish luminous masses that gradually

faded away. Its apparent course was in a great circle through /3 Cauis Ma-

joris to a point near the S.E. horizon in azimuth S. 28|°E., and altitude Sg".
For /3 Canis Majoris the azimuth was S. 20° 52'-4 W., and altitude 16° 43'-3.

It is to be regretted that a meteor of such unusual splendour and magni-

tude, which must (if clouds permitted) have been widely visible over the

south of Ireland, and .in the west and soiith-west parts of England, has not

received any public or private notice which has hitherto come to the know-

ledge of the Committee, nor any apparent recognition from observers ; while,

if the important astronomical interest chat attaches to its appearance is rightly

understood, the great advantage of their investigation, if such have been pre-

served, it may yet be hoped, will prevail upon observers to communicate them

to the Committee.

of its appearing in the daytime, probably less conspicuous than the preceding

meteor, was seen on the afternoon of the above day by Mr. "Whipple, at the

Kew Observatory, by whom the following observations of its appearance were

recorded* :
   " Yesterday afternoon, whilst standing on the lawn of the observatory, with

mj^back to the sun, which was brightly shining, I saw a splendid meteor fall

in the south-east. The sky at the time was of an intense blue, and cloudless,

with the exception of a few cirri in the north and north-west, and the meteor,

as seen against it, presented the appearance of polished silver. The flight of

the meteor was almost vertical, at an altitude of about 30°; its extent was

about 1 0°, and the tail, which seemed to hang in the air and fade away like

the tail of a rocket, was, at the instant of exi^losion, probably 3° in length.

There was no report accompanying its disruption, or it would certainly have

been heard, the neighbourhood being very still at the time. Immediately on

^its disappearance I looked at my watch ; it was 36" p.m., Greenwich mean

time. Had the fall occurred after dai'k, I have no doubt but that the meteor

"would have exhibited a magnificent spectacle ; for its brilliancy far exceeded

that of the moon as seen by daylight."

the latter hour at Beeston Observatory, near Nottingham, by Mr. Lowe. The

descriptions of these meteors, which ai'e included in the following general

list, differ in some important physical respects, which might almost lead to an

independent conclusion that two different meteors were observed. The meteor

seen by Mr. Wood at Birmingham was deep blue ; its nucleus disappeared

without apparent expansion or explosion, and left a very slight, evanescent

streak upon its course. The meteor observed by Mr. Lowe at Beestou was
distinctly red ; it burst with a flash, and left a very enduring streak of red
points upon its course. With these essential differences of character (and

even with the short interval of only one minute between the times of their
observations), the identity of the meteor seen at Beeston with that observed

by himself is regarded by Mr. Wood as not sufficiently established, or as

being at least open to question, in the absence of further observation. The

recorded positions of the meteors' paths are, moreover, so close to each other,
that although they present a small displacement in the right direction to be
produced by the great distance (about 45 miles) between the observers' places
at Beeston and Birmingham, yet the unusual height of 360 miles above the
earth at first appearance, and of 240 miles at disappearance, which their
comparison together would suppose, must be regarded as requiring a proof
from further observations, of which none have hitherto been received by the
Committee.

    The following accounts of two aerolites which feU last year are extracted
from the scientific journals in which their descriptions have recently ap-

peared.

  --1. Searsmont, Maine, U.S., 1871, May 21, S** a.m. (local time). Professor

Shephard, of Amherst CoUege, Massachusetts, has published some particulars

respecting the meteoric stone which fell at Searsmont, Maine, U.S., on May

21st. About 8 A.M. there was heard an explosion, like the report of a heavy
gun, followed by a rushing sou^nd resembling the escape of steam from a
boiler. The stone fell in a field, and a lady who was in a house close by
saw the earth scattered in all directions as it entered the ground. The hole
which it made was soon found, and on digging down the fragments were
found stiU quite hot, the outside surfaces showing plainly the effects of
melting heat. The largest piece weighed two pounds, and the fragments
altogether twelve pounds. They emitted an odour like that of flints when
rubbed violently together. The hole made by the falling body was two feet
in depth, the soil being a hard coarse gravel ; but the fracture of the stone
was obviously occasioned by its striking against three large pebbles, each
 about four pounds in weight. Professor Shephard obtained and examined
the largest fragTuent of the aerolite. FnUy one half of its surface was coated
 with the original crust, and the shape would seem to denote that the perfect
 mass had been of an oval, subconical figure with a flattish base, so as on the
whole to have approached the shape of the famous DuraUa stone now in the

British Museum. Among the constituent elements were found meteoric iron,

 peroxide of iron, chladnite, troilite, together with a single blackish mass
 which Professor Shephard considered was in all probability a plumbaginous
 aggregate. The following notice of its composition has also recently ap-
 peared :
. . " This meteoric stone has been examined by Dr. Lawrence Smith (SiUiman's

/American Journal of Science,' September 1871, p. 200). He finds it resemble

very closely the Mauerkirchen stone that feU in 1768, the crusts correspond-
ing quite closely both in thickness and appearance; the Mauerkirchen stone,
however, has not well-marked globules like that of Searsmont, and in this
respect it corresponds more nearly to the Aussun aerolite. Its specific gravity

was 3-701, and its composition is--

that an aeroUte weighing 127 lbs. fell lately near Montereau (Seine et Marne),
in Trance. It appears to have come from the east, and burst with a loud
explosion, giving a bright blue light. It is of an irregular spheroid shape,

--and black, and is to be sent to the Academy of Sciences," ' Nature,' Novem-

        IV. Meteokic Showehs.

   In the prosecution of a system of observations on the annual meteor-
showers of the past year, proposed to engage the constant attention of the
Committee since their last Report, a more than usually abundant series of
successful observations were made, exhibiting with greater completeness than
in previous years the general character of the displays, which have presented
themselves with more than ordinary prominency on each of the annual

shower-meteor dates.

  A first description of the observations collected at the several British Asso-

ciation Stations <^ the nights of the 9 th to the 12th of August last is con-
tained in the Quarterly Journal of the Meteorological Society for the 15th
of November, 1871, where the numbers of meteors mapped at the different
stations, and their rate of frequency at certain places where their numbers
were counted in successive hours and half-hours, were for the most part fully
stated. The following are some additional observations relating especially to
this latter point, and to the general characters of the August shower in 1871,

as they were recorded by the different observers.

   The numbers seen per hour by Mr. Wood at Birmingham were, on the night

of the 9th twelve, on the 10th twenty-four, and on the 11th sixteen. The
meteors came in groups, with lulls ; they were mostly small, and with a much
larger proportion than usual of orange-coloured and train-bearing meteors.

    In the watch kept by Captain Maclear at the Royal Naval College at
Portsmouth on the night of the 10th, the sky was throughout clear or over-
spread with such a slight haze as only occasionally to dim the faintest stars
and all the brightest meteors visible were noted between 11 o'clock p.m. and
2 o'clock A.M. from a favourable point of view upon the College roof, where
a number of the brightest meteors visible between ll*" 45TM and 12'' 45°*
was also added to the list by Lieutenant Mathias, whose attention was di-
rected towards a different quarter of the sky ; and the number of meteors
visible in a somewhat less favourable position between lO"" and ll** p.m. was

also counted alone by Captain Maclear. Deducting one quarter of the
meteors seen between 11'' 45'" and 12'' 45"" as having been observed by
Lieut. Mathias, the remaining numbers of bright meteors seen by Captain

Maclear alone in the successive half-hours ending, during the night of

Aug. 10th, at 10" SO" 11", 11" 30"", 12", 12" 30'", 13", 13" 30"', 14", Total

were 5  10 10 12 21 22 14 23 117,

showing an increase in the rate of frequency until the end of the Avatch.
                              --

80 KEPORT--1872.

Besides those noted, many smaller meteors passed unrecorded, about tAvo

thirds of the meteors counted being as bright as first, and some of the rest as

bright as second-magnitude stars. But few meteors were visible on the night

of the 9th ; and twelve were seen between 9" and 10" p.m. on the 11th.

Between 10" and 11" p.m. on the 11th no shooting-star was visible, although

the sky was then as olear as it had been during the previous hour, or on

the night of the 10th. A bright meteor shot downwards through Corona soon

after 10" 30"', and a remarkably large one close to Saturn soon after 10" 45'"

P.M. on the 10th. The latter meteor was pear-shaped; it lighted up the

objects round the observer, and burst at the end of its course like a shell.

This meteor was also seen at Cardiff, and was described, in a communi-

--cation to Mr. Glaisher on the meteors of that evening by Mr. G. C. Thompson,

as foUows : " Aug. 10th, 10" 51'" p.m. Meteor equal to or larger than

Venus ; from direction of a^, o, Capricorni, downwards towards the west (right
hand), inclined about 60° to the horizon. Beautiful light-green hue. Near

the end of its course it seemed to divide into several fragments, or a small

cloud of sparks." It was also visible at Greenwich, where the following

notes of its appearance were recorded by Mr. Glaisher's staff of observers at

the Royal Observatory :--" Aug. 10th, 10" 51'" 15' p.m. Brighter than

Jupiter; pale green; duration of flight 0-7 second; length of course 5° : left

a fine train. Meteor pear-shaped; from 12° below, and to right of Antares,

fell perpendicularly." At Hawkhurst a broad red flash, like that of lightning,

was visible in the sky at 10" 50"" p.m. ; but the meteor itself was not seen.

It was, however, well seen in the neighbourhood of Hawkhurst, and a pretty

accurate measurement of its apparent path by objects near which it appeared

to pass was there obtained. It fell nearly vertically from about 20° to about

3" or 4° above the horizon, 60° W. from magnetic south, with no great speed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and it appeared to burst, with sparks, when at its brightest. At 11" 2"', Paris

time, corresponding within a few minutes with the time of this observation, a

meteor of twice the briUiancy of Venus, of strong whitish light, like an electric

spark, was also seen in the south by the observers of M. Le Vcrrier's staff at St.

Lo, on the French coast of the English Channel, and at Angers on the Loire.

Of the other bright meteors seen at Portsmouth on the night of the 10th,

one descended towards the east, and burst at disappearance, at about

12" 45""; and one jjassed across Polaris at 12" 55°'. At about 1" 30"" a

bright green meteor appeared in the S.S.E., at an altitude of about 10°,

moving towards the S.S.W. Shortly afterwards a very bright one passed

across Pegasus towards the S.W., with an explosion at disappearance. One

of the last two meteors may not impossibly be identical with a fireball ob-

served by the observers of M. Le Verrier's staff at Trcmont at 1" 32'" 49" (Paris

time) on the same night, which passed from E.A. 235°, N.P.D. 29°, to B.A.

233°, N.P.D. 39°, and burst at disappearance with a strong red light, leaving

a luminous streak \ipon its course that was visible for 33 seconds.

On each evening of the shower the numbers of the meteors were also noted,

W.under favourable conditions of the sky, by Mr.       F. Denning, at Bristol,

with the following results :

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.                      81

Attention was principally directed to the northern sky, and many meteors

doubtless escaped observation. Most of those observed were especially

small ones ; those seen on the 9th were nearly all minute and scarcely dis-
cernible. Several brilliant ones were seen, however. At 12'' 23"* on

August 10, a meteor of great lustre, and star-like in appearance, diverged
from Perseus towards the horizon. It was of a blue colour, and left a lumi-

nous streak which was visible for about four seconds.

At 10'' 4-1'" on August 11, another brilliant one, about as bright as Venus,

was visible in Ursa Minor, and the train of light which it left was visible
for a few seconds. It was, however, at 12'' 50TM on the latter date that the

most brilliant meteor was seen. It passed between the fourth-magnitude

stars e and ^ Cygni, and soon afterwards disappeared, leaving a train of light

which endured for about seven seconds. This one, like the great majority

of those observed, radiated from or nearly from the small star B Camelopardi.

The first of these bright meteors corresponds with an observation at

Cardiff, contained in the description of the star-shower on the 10th of

--August communicated to Mr. Glaisher by Mr. G. C. Thompson : " August
--A11, 12'' 22"' A.M.
                       meteor, as bright as Venus, passing downwards between

u and /3 Aurigfe, from the direction of the sword-handle in Perseus. Fine
purple colour ; leaving a portion of phosphorescent train visible for about
half a minute, which had, I think, a lateral drifting motion in the direction

of /) Aurigaj."

   No sound followed the explosion of any of these meteors. Mr. Denning

adds the following list of observations of the same shower by Mr. Edmund
Neison in London, who was assisted in his watch for the meteors by two
friends, and who recorded the numbers visible on successive nights.

84; REPOllT-- 1873.

The following observations of the shower by Mr. E. P. Greg, at Man-

chester, on the night of the 10th, and at Bolton on the nights of the 11th

--and 12th, describe the unusual appearance of one of the most remarkable

meteors recorded in the above list : " The number of the meteors was

larger than usual, thougli not remarkably so. On the 10th and 11th,

between lO*" 30" and 12'', I did not perceive much difference in the horary

numbers                                                perhaps  four or five in a minute for                       two observers ;  coming
                                                    :

sometimes four or five nearly together, and then several minutes passing

without any being visible. On the evening of the 12th there was a great

falling off, not only in the numbers, but also in the size and flashing train

peculiar to the Perseids. At about 9'' 30" p.m. on the 10th, before I looked

out, I heard that a splendid meteor was seen here.

" At 12" 31", on the night of the 10-llth of August, a very remarkable

meteor appeared in the S.E., which I hope may have been doubly observed,

although it was visible after the time appointed for the simultaneous watch.

It commenced close to /3 Andromedse, moving nearly on a line from t] Persei

to a point a little beyond the star y Pegasi, which it almost crossed,

describing a course of 10° or 12° in about two seconds. The nucleus had a

sensible disk of about 2' in diameter, and, together with the train, showed

prismatic colours. The train lasted twenty or thirty seconds, and soon

assumed a serpentine appearance. It was one of the most beautiful meteors

I have seen. About four or five seconds after it had disappeared, it broke out

again five or six degrees further on, near X Piscium, moving exactly in the same

direction, apparently the same meteor over again, about half its former size,

but with the same colours, and leaving a bright streak on this part of its

course for about three seconds. What appears most unaccountable was that

it broke out again three or four seconds, at least, after it should have done,

had it been the same meteor continuing onwards at the same velocity. It

seemed, instead, to be another meteor, although it must have been the same
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

but how its speed could be so checked after it first ceased to be visible, and

it could then go on at the same speed as before, I do not know."

The results of the regular observations made at the Royal Observatory at

Greenwich, by Mr. Glaisher's staff of observers, are, in point of numbers and

of the brightness of the meteors seen, very similar to those obtained at

Oxford, the watch on the nights of the 10th and 11th being kept for about

six hours and four and a half hours, and during from two to three hours on

each of the remaining nights. The total number of meteors mapped, by the

parties of from one to four observers who watched during a space of about

25"  50" on                                            the  different nights was  470                     and the  average number per hour,
                                                                                                       ;

   The first meteor, equal to or exceeding the brightness of Jupiter, seen
during the display was that already noticed, which was recorded at 10" 51"

P.M. on the night of the 10th. At 9" 30" p.m. on the 11th a bluish-white

meteor, brighter than Venus, appeared low down near the eastern horizon,
immediately below y Andromeda?. At 10" 15" p.m. on the same evening a
similar meteor, brighter than Jupiter, appeared near b Ljncis, and moved

about 15° in 1| second in a direction from c Camelopardi, leaving a bright

gtrcfik for three seconds. A meteor of the same magnitude, which appeared
OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.                                 85

at lO*" 23"' 30' P.M. ou the evening of the 12th, and which left a flue streak,

moved from a different radiant-point, for about 1| second, in a course
of 10° between /3 and ?j Pegasi, from the direction of d Piscium. At
10'' 46TM and ll"" 7"" p.m., on the same evening, meteors of greenish colour

were seen, leaving long and bright streaks ; that of the first was visible for
fourteen seconds ; and the meteor (as will shortly be described) was also seen

at Hawkhurst. The last brilliant meteor of the shower was visible at

lO*" 35'" P.M. on the 13th, of greenish colour, like the last two, and leaving

an exceedingly bright streak, which was visible for six seconds after the
meteor had disappeared. It passed from the direction of t] Persei, about 1°

below Polaris and /3 XJrsce Minoris. At about the same time, or shortly

before 11 o'clock on the evening of the 13th, a brilliant meteor appears to

have been seen at Regent's Park, London, among other meteors of the

Ashower which there still continued to be plentiful.  notable example

of the meteors occasionally appearing in groups occurred at lO** 49"' p.m.

on the 10th, when three meteors, about as bright as second-magnitude

stars, appeared within an interval of about ten seconds, and all passed in a

nearly identical path in continuation of a line joining y Andromedse and

a Triangulfe. Two meteors, brighter than first-magnitude stars, also ap-

peared within four seconds of each other, moving in parallel and closely

neighbouring courses, inclined about 45° towards the horizon, in the con-

stellation Capricornus, at 11'' 4"' 20' p.m. on the 10th. This brilliant pair

was simultaneously observed at Hawkhurst, each meteor about the bright-

ness of Sirius, leaving a long, bright, and slender streak. The first com-

mencing about 2° above /3 Aqiiarii, moved on a course exactly parallel to
that of the second, which passed, with the same steady speed as the first,

from half a degree below ^ Aquarii to half a degree below h Capricorni.

Mr. Wood, at Birmingham, also noted the appearance, at the same minute,

and within about two seconds of each other, of this ijerfectly matched and

closely adjacent pair. Each meteor was about as bright as Sirius, of orange

colour, lasted one second, and left a reddish streak upon its course. The path

of the first, as seen at Birmingham, was from 6 Aquarii to S Capricorni ; and

that of the second was parallel and closely adjoining to it from a point in

R. A. 325°, S. Decl. 22°, to R. A. 321°, S. Decl. 26°. Closely as all these de-

scriptions of them correspond together, the unfavourable position of their

apparent paths near the horizon prevents the real heights and the distances

of the component meteors of the pair from each other and from the

observers fi-om being calculated with the accuracy and certainty that would

otherwise have been attainable from such excellent observations.

Almost all the meteors observed at Greenwich during the display left

more or less brilliant and enduring streaks. With the exception of one

reddish, four white, eight pale green or greenish, and twenty-six yellowish

meteors (in all about 8 per cent.), all the meteors mapped at Greenwich were

uniformly of a bluish or bluish-white colour.

   As seen on the nights of the 10th and 11th in Loudon, the following is

--Mr. Crumplen's description of the August meteors : " The sky was quite

clear, but there was an auroral glare in the north, and a white streamer

flickering for a few minutes on the evening of the 10th*. Eighty-two

 --* The auroral streamer was also seen by Mr. W. H. Jackson at Tooting near

London, who writes : " On the 10th there was a tolerably distinct aurora borealis, one

streamer of which extended from the north to a spot apparently a considerable distance

beyond Arcturus." At York a distinct auroral arch was seen by Mr. J. E. Clark on the

th, lasting from after twilight, when it first appeared, until 11'' 30", when it was

Aobscured by the rising moon.  similar faint appearance was observed by Professor

Herschel, at Glasgow, on the evening of the 7tb.
8G REroRT--1873.

meteors were counted between 9^ 30TM and midnight, of which forty-six
fell during the last hour. The courses of fifty-six bright meteors were
mapped during a watch of about eight hours on the nights of the 9th,

10th, and 11th, with an average hourly rate of appearance, for one observer,

of three bright meteors on the 9th, nine on the 10th, and ten on the 11th,

all of them directed from Perseus. The Perseids were of all magnitudes,

but the greater number of bright ones (in proportion to the number visible)

made their appearance on the 11th. They presented the appearances com-

mon to the meteors of this radiant ; and some of them left

brilliant streaks of blue light, which expanded after the o -<r-  ~r:=>-

disappearance of the nucleus, fading gradually from the ends

towards the centre. In several instances I noticed that the nucleus was

apparently separate from the train, the brighter ones reminding me very

much of the corresponding shower of 1863."

On the nights of the 10th and 11th the sky was overcast at Edinburgh

and Glasgow ; but several bright meteors were seen at Glasgow on the nights

of the 7th, 8th, and 9th by Professor Herschcl, one of which shot with a

flash overhead at about 12'' 48TM a.m. on the 9th, resembling faint lightning.

At Edinburgh on the 9th, and at Sunderland on the 11th and 12th, the

paths of fifteen Perseids were also mapped by Mr. T. W. Backhouse,

although the sky was obscured at Sunderland by thick fog and haze. At

Knocklong in Ireland a good view of the shower was obtained by Mr.

--Jeremiah Henly, whose description of its appearance was communicated to

the Committee by Mr. "W. F. Denning : " Although I did not reckon the

actual number visible, I considered that more meteors appeared on the 11th

than on the 10th. On the 11th, in about three hours, I witnessed thirty-

three of remarkable brilliancy, whUe on the 10th, in the same space of time,

only twenty-seven of a similar character were visible ; but the smaller

meteors I did not reckon on either night." Mr. Denning also regarded the

shower at Bristol as at least as intense on the second as on the first night

--of its appearance, and thus describes the principal characters of the meteors

seen : " The majority of the meteors were accompanied with trains,

which, however, disappeared immediately on the extinction of the head.
Most of those seen were white, but several appeared blue, and some

of a yellow colour. No sound was heard after the explosion of any of
them. The meteors were most numerous on the night of the llth-12th;
and the same was the case in the year 1869, according to my own

observations."

   At Hawkhurst the paths of 107 bright meteors were recorded with more

or less detail by one observer, during a watch of about ten hours, on the

nights of the 9th-13th of August, lasting about three hours (until shortly

after midnight) on each of the first three nights, and for a shorter time on
the other two. The average hourly numbers noted on the former nights
were six bright meteors on the 9th, sixteen on the 10th, and eleven of

similar character on the 11th. Three brilliant meteors appeared on the

night of the 12th, and one on the night of the 13th, among ten bright ones
recorded in an hour on the former, and seven in the same time on the latter

night. Of these, the first (already stated to have been seen at the Royal
Observatory, Greenwich) appeared at lO'' 46" 30' p.m., with a sensible disk

and apparently fully as bright as Yenus, of dazzling bluish-white light,

crossing ft UrsEe Minoris from a point about half a degree below Polaris, be-
ginning at R. A. 40°, N. Decl. 891°, and ending at R. A. 225°, N. Dccl. 75°.

It left a bright streak which remained visible, on its whole course for about

three seconds. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the meteor, of pale-
green colour, leaving a bnght streak visible for fourteen seconds, moved

in about two seconds from i Cassiopeice across /3 Cephei, almost to o Lyree.
The other two bright meteors seen at Hawkhurst on the 12th were scarcely
inferior in brightness to this one. That which appeared at 11'' 16'" passed
from r Pegasi to a point midway between y Piscium and H Aquarii, changing
from blue to yellow colour as it increased, and leaving a bright streak for a
few seconds on its course. The second was observed at ll"* 34"", passing in
fully one and a half second over 30° or 40° of arc from the star /3 Andromedoe,
along a line directed from ^ Cassiopeias and inclined about 50° to the horizon.
It left a bright streak for some seconds on its course, which was broken into

two, or had two maxima of brightness at two different points of its length.

The apparent paths of these two meteors were :

   The trains of most of the meteors seen at Hawkhurst were bluish and
rather faint, except when seen foreshortened. They sometimes distinctly
spread out after the star had disappeared, and grew gauze-like. They
rarely resembled the golden-yellow dotted lines which have sometimes been

seen to mark the track of bright meteors in former August showers.

Position of the Badiant-point.

  At Bristol, on the evening of the 10th, Mr. W. F. Denning " saw several

small meteors which, from their various paths, must have been in close

proximity to a radiant-point which is

undoubtedly situated at R. A. 2^ 30"                                          «

Perseus," and between ^ Persei and B

Camelopardi. I saw several small

meteors whose paths were extremely
short, that came exactly from the
place I have indicated. The annexed

is a rough delineation of a few of the
meteors' paths that were observed in

the neighbourhood of this radiant-
point in Camelopardalus. There were

many other meteors whose paths were
conformable to B Camelopardi ; and

there appears no doubt as to this being

the radiant-point, or rather the prin-

cipal one."                                Came 10-

appeared clear enough to me that there was more than one radiant, or that

a somewhat extensive space of the sky would be required if the tracks of all

the meteors were to be included in it. I believe, however, that the great

majority of the meteors will be found to have diverged from a spot rather

higher than the famous cluster in Perseus (33 ^vi), say about 1° above.

Meteors from this point have been plentiful each evening, and three quarters

of those observed between 11'' and 12'' on the 10th came from there. I

noticed that these followed each other rapidly, and that after a lull for a few

minutes, a radiant still higher would manifest itself, as will be indicated by

the map. The radiants in Ursa Major, Cygnus, and Pegasus were also

active, especially the latter ; but with one or two exceptions these meteors

were not particularly noted."

From a very full projection of more than 300 meteors seen at York between

the 5th and the 12th of August, Mr. J. E. Clark obtained the proportions of

the meteors directed from each of the principal radiant-points of the shower

in 1871. "The proportion of the Persei'ds observed was about 85 per cent.,

from Cygnus 7 per cent., from the radiant below e Pegasi about 4| per
cent., from Polaris about 2 per cent., and from an apparent radiant-point

in Aquarius about 1 per cent. One meteor was observed in Auriga, appa-

rently from a radiant-point near /3 Aurigse.

   " The main radiant on the 10th, as shown by the mapped courses, lay close

to 7] Persei ; but very many were directed from a Persei, or even lower still,

whilst a large number extended the radiant to x- Besides the central radiant,
there seemed to be one or two outlying points from which the tracks appear

to diverge. One of these seems to be between j3 and y Andromeda;, and

another by c Camelopardi.

" Of meteors almost stationary, the best was one seen by Mr. Waller

and Mr. Brown just by rj Persei on the 8th. I observed some nearly

so, near y Persei on the 8th, below r/ on the 10th, and at ^ on the 11th, also
by V Draconis on the 10 th; and Mr. Brown saw one by p Cephei on

the 8th."

In a letter in 'Nature' of August 17, 1871, Mr. Clark communicates the

numbers of the meteors seen on each night, together with some further par-

ticulars regarding the above radiant-points, which are here appended.

" Having been engaged during the past Aveek in observations on the August

meteors, I thought a few of the results might be interesting to some of your

Mynumerous subscribers.    regular observations extended fi'om Sunday night

to Friday night ; and, as the following Table will show, the weather was, with

the exception of one night, as favourable as could reasonably be desired.

From over 120 meteors mapped down (out of about 330 seen) it is evident

that, the principal radiant-point, or rather line, is a line drawn from a Persei

to y Persei, and onwards towards jj. One bright meteor was seen on the 8th,

just below T) Persei, which did not move more than i° in a second of time,

Aand left a cloud behind it lasting about two seconds.  remarkable feature

was the outlying radiants, as they appeared to be, one of which was situated

at or near 6 Cassiopeise, another near the star c of Camelopardalus. The

radiant situated between o Cygni and y Draconis is very well marked ; also a

radiant near y Cephei (where another almost stationary meteor was

observed), and one just below e Pegasi, towards a Aquarii; associated

apparently with the last is a radiant near the small lozenge in Delphinus,

above a Aquila.

cent., were from the Perseus radiant or radiants :

Aprojected upon separate maps.  similar projection of the paths of the

meteors recorded at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich on the night of the

10th of August was also made upon a separate map for each interval of ten

minutes during the hours of observation. With the exception of the period

between 9^ and 10" p.m. on the 10th among the Greenwich observations, and

between 9'' 45" and 10'' 45" p.m. on the same evening among those of the

British-Association observers, when 40 per cent, of all the meteors mapped

diverged very accurately from a centre of radiation at about E. A. 34°, N.

Decl. 61° nearly midway between ^ Persei and t Cassiopeise, and a very

marked activity of this radiant-point during the following hours of both those

scries of observations until midnight on the 10th, no tendency to accurate

divergence from a single radiant-point during any sustained jieriodwas obser-

Avable during the continuance of the shower.   radiant-point near rj Persei,

which was also discernible among the British-Association observations on each

evening of the shower, presented itself most conspicuously in those made at
Greenwich on the evening of the 10th, towards midnight, and by the inter-

section of its meteor-tracks with otliers from the more northern radiant,

appeared to give rise to a prominent centre of divergence after midnight

between y and e Cassiopeiaj, which may have owed its apparent activity to

the simultaneous existence of the former pair. The general radiant-point of
the meteoric shower at Greenwich on the night of the 10 th was very nearly

the principal one already indicated, with a tendency, especially after midnight,

of some meteors to come from directions nearer to n and to y Persei. All
the meteor-tracks noted by the British-Association observers between 9^ 30""

and 12'M4" on the 10th having been projected upon a single map with the

radiant-point in Perseus near the centre of the projection, a densely crowded
region of intersection of the tracks prolonged backwards was found to occupy
a roughly triangular space of about 10° in length along each side, having its

centre very nearly at the above indicated spot in li. A. 36°, N". Decl. 58°, and
its angles in nearly symmetrical positions at points in E. A. 31°, N. Decl. 61°,
R. A. 36°, N. Decl. 53°, and R. A. 45°, N. Decl. 50°, as shown by the small

circles marked (lo) in the accompanying figure. The first of these points cor-

responds very closely with the definite radiant-point, which was most conspi-

cuous during the early portion of the shower.

On the night of the 11th the principal intersection of meteor-tracks recorded

at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, was still close to the latter point, at

R. A. 31°, N. Decl. 62°, during the hours of observation from 9" until 13" 30'",

previous night, a few degrees northward from j^ Persei, at R. A. 31°, N.

marked its position very nearly. The tracks of the remaining meteors were

almost evenly distributed round it, within distances which included nearly all
the courses of 12° or 15° from its centre. But other apparent centres of radia-

tion also presented themselves somewhat definitely near the north and south

borders of the radiant-region, in the neighbourhood of e Cassiopeiae and r) Persei,

at points in R. A. 25°, N. Decl. 63°, and R. A. 42°, N. Decl. 55°, as shown

in the figure by the small circles marked (u), forming apparent outliers of the

central point.
OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS.  91

   On the night of the 9th of August the apparent paths of 38 rerseVcls re-

corded by the British-Associiition observers between 9'' and 12'' 50'" appear
to have diverged from two definite radiant-points of nearly equal intensity at
the extremities of an oval space, extending from ?/ Persei to near e Cassiopeise,
through which nearly all the recorded paths prolonged backwards passed.
These points were situated in li. A. 29°, N.DccL60°, and R. A. 39°, +55°.

The general centre of divergence of the Perseids during the whole period of
greatest intensity of the shower on the nights of the 9th-12th of August, 1871,
was shown by the combined results of these observations to be a few degrees
northwards from the star ^ Persei, and not far from a point in R. A. 35°,
N. Decl. 59°, which is the average place obtained by giving equal weight to

all the separate radiant-centres shown iu the figure, of which tlic positions

were determined from the observations of the shower communicated to the
Committee by the observers for the British Association. The figure represents
in plane perspective the apparent paths of all the Perseids noted on the nights
of the 9th, 10th, and 11th of August, 1871, whose visible tracks were in the
immediate vicinity of the general radian-tregion of the shower.

  --Meteor-showers in October, 1871 . On the night of October 14th, between

ll*" and 12'' p.m., six meteors, as bright or brighter than Ist-magnitude
stars, were observed at Hawkhurst in one hour, radiating -with considerable
accuracy from a point near the head of Aries, and close to the point of first,
appearance on this date of the radiant R^ in Musca, which appears to contri-
bute bright meteors from the direction of this constellation during the prin-
cipal meteor-showers of October, November, and December, but from which

so many bright meteors in one hour as those seen at Hawkhurst on the above

date form an exceptional display. Another meteor, like one noted on this
date, as bright as Sirius, proceeded from the same radiant-point, passing over-
head at Hawkhurst, and leaving a faint streak, at 11'' 45'" p.m. on the 19th
and two scarcely less brilliant members of the same meteor-shower appeared,
with short courses and slow motion, near the radiant-point on the 21st of
October. Three or four bright meteors with swift motion and leaving bright
streaks on their tracks, proceeding apparently from circuinpolar radiants near
Aj^, ,5 and Fj, ^ in Cassiopeia and Auriga, were noted during the same short
watch at Hawkhurst which was kept on each of those dates. The sky was

overcast with rain and wind on the nights of the 18th and 19th at Hawk-

hurst, and at all the other places from which communications were received
and although occasional openings of the clouds allowed a few stars to be seen at
Hawkhurst, where the single bright meteor last noticed was observed, and at

Tooting, where Mr. H. W. Jackson kept a watch for them whenever the state

of the sky permitted, no other shooting-stars were recorded. But in a mode-
rately clear sky, from 7'' 45"" until 11'' p.m. on the 18th, six meteors of some
brightness were mapped at the Boyal Observatory, Greenwich, two of which
were directed from E.3, one from the north pole, and the rest from a radiant-
point near A^^ ^j in Cassiopeia, or F^ ^ in Auriga.

    On the night of the 20th the sky remained overcast at the southern

 stations ; but at Birmingham, Sunderland, and Glasgow a few meteors were
visible through fog and haze, which generally obscured all stars less bright
than the third magnitude, until nearly midnight, when the sky gradually
became more clear. Three small shooting-stars were observed at Glasgow

by Mr. R. M'Clure between 1 1'' and 12'' p.m., and two by Mr. Wood at Bir-

 mingham, as described in his observations on the shower.
    Between 9 o'clock and midnight on the same evening, four meteors, three

 of which were directed nearly from R^, and one apparently from the north

pole, were observed by Mr. T. W. Backhouse at Sunderland ; they were

 unconformable to the radiant (Schiaparelli, No. 30, B. A. Report for 1870,
 p. 98), or to any of the other radiant-points noted by Mr. Backhouse in the
 morning hours of this and the two following nights. Another bright and
 unconformable meteor, seen on the same night, was also directed from the
 north pole ; while the twenty-one remaining meteors, seen in the course of
 about two hours of observation on the mornings of the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd
 (and all but three on the earlier dates), indicated the return of the October
 meteors, and presented some contemporaneous radiant-points, of which Mr.
 Backhouse gives the following description in his remarks on these results of
 his observations :

   " The meteors marked A [twelve meteors noted in about an hour and a

the 23rd] in the list belong to SchiaparcUi's liadiant No. 36 *, and those

marked C [two meteors noted on the last morning of the watch] to his

No. 37 f. Those marked B [five meteors seen on the mornings of the first

two nights] have a radiant-point in R. A. 113°, N. Decl. -58° J ; but, owing
to the remarkable swiftness of these meteors, this point can be only approxi-

Amate. I make the radiant-point of at R. A. 97°, N. Decl. 15°, taking the

observations of all three nights. The meteors marked U were unconform-

able to all these showers. It will be seen that only one of these appeared in

any of the mornings, and no unconformable ones in the evenings.

"The hourly rate of frequency of meteors of all- kinds, at that time of

morning at which thej were most numerous, was on the 20th [morning of

the 21st] 19, on the 21st 12, on the 22nd 8."

None of the shooting-stars observed at Hawkhurst, or at the Royal Obser-

vatory, Greenwich, on the evenings of the 14th and 18th of October were

directed from the radiant-point in Orion ; but on the night of the 21st the
tracks of eleven meteors from this radiant-point were mapped at Hawkhurst

between the hours of 11*" 30"" and 13'' 30"', and an approximate position of

the radiant-point was obtained. This appeared to be between the stars }, v

known group. The following notice of

a contemporaneous radiant-point accompanies Mr. Backhouse's description of

his observations of the shower :

" I enclose a Table of the most important meteors that I saw last month.

Those marked L are Leonids, and those marked 11^ are conformable to Heis's
radiant-point H*. I was surpiised to see two Leonids so early as November

8 ; although the path of that at 10'' 37'" was not quite in the right direction
for the great shower of the 13th, I have not the least doubt that it was one

of them, for it was exactly like them. I watched for the Leonids for 25

minutes on the 12th [morning of the 13th], between 16'' 17'" and 17" 25"',

and saw two. The next night was throughout cloudy, whenever I looked

out, with very small gaps in the clouds, so I saw no meteors." Besides the

Leonids here noticed five meteors directed from the radiant-point E.^ were

seen on the nights of the 8th and 9th of November.

   At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the sky was overcast on the nights

Aof the 11th and 13th, and only clear at intervals on that of the 12th.

watch was, however, kept on the last two of these nights until after 3 o'clock

on the morning of the 13th, and until daybreak on the morning of the 14th

of November, and the apparent courses of about thirty shooting-stars were

mapped. Of these, four on each night proceeded, roughly, from the direction

of Leo, the remaining meteor-courses being chiefly directed from Taurus and

from other contemporaneous radiant-points in other parts of the sky. On

the night of the 14-15th the sky was again quite overcast ; and as far as

could be gathered from the observations under such unfavourable conditions,

the number of the Leonids observed was two or three times less than that of

the meteors visible from other radiant-points, or of the sporadic meteors visible

on an ordinary November night ; and no distinct return of the November

meteor-shower at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, covxld be recorded as

having been visible on the annual dates in the year 1871.

Although cloudy on the previous and the following nights, the sky was

remarkably clear at Hawkhnrst on the night of the 13th-14th of November;

and a watch for the November meteors was kept from half-past eleven until

half-past one, and again for about half an hour soon after two o'clock. The

first Leonid was visible at 11'' 33"', as bright as Jupiter, passing in a long

course and leaving a long streak from under Ursa Minor to the N.W. horizon.

In the following two hours twelve Leonids and twenty-six other meteors,

none of very great brilliancy, were noted, and their courses were mapped by

one observer. The unconformable shooting-stars all proceeded from a radiant-

region in or near the space contained between the heads of Taurus and Orion

and the feet of Gemini and Auriga, while the Leonids were directed from a

better-defined radiant-region in the head of Leo. Two more Leonids, and

two other meteors belonging to the group from Taurus, were recorded during
the short watch between 2'' and 2'' 30TM a.m. on the 14th. One accordant
observation of a meteor from Taurus, simultaneously observed at the Royal
Observatory, Greenwich, at 12'' 3'" 12% was obtained ; and the comparative rate
of frequency of the Leonids and of the unconformable or sporadic meteors
visible during the same watch nearly confirmed the results of the watch kept
by Mr. Glaisher's staff of observers at the latter place.

    At the observatory of Stonyhurst CoUege the Ilev. S. J. Perry obtained an
uninterrupted view of the November meteors during several hours of their
appearance on the morning of the 13th of November ; and the following
results are obtained from the list of meteors which he observed. The sky
was overcast until lO*" 15'" p.m. on the 12th (when a regular watch was com-
menced), and was clear, with the exception of a few stratus clouds, until
3^ 15"", when it became quite clear, and remained so until the end of the
watch at 6" 30TM a.m. on the morning of the 13th. The times and other par-
ticulars of the^appearance of fifty-five meteors were recorded, with the posi-
tions of their apparent paths among the stars. Of these about twenty were
Leonids, and fifteen, seven of which were Leonids, were as bright as first-
magnitude stars. The following numbers of shooting-stars, and of the
meteors which appeared to radiate from Leo, were observed in the successive

hours ending at

   The majority of the unconformable meteors noted during the watch pro-

ceeded from the directions of those parts of Gemini, Orion, Taurus, and
Auriga near the head stars of Orion, or between the Hyades, the Pleiades,
and the Twins.

   " In the watch for meteors kept under the direction of M. Le Verrier in
France, on the nights of the 12th, 13th, and 14th of November, those ob-
served on the 12th and 13th issued from a point in the neighbourhood of the
constellation Auriga ; the ' Leonides,' or meteors issuing from Leo, were most
numerous on the night of the 14th" (Notes from the ' Comptes Rendus' of

Nov. 20, 1871, in ' Nature' of Nov. 30, 1871).
   The following description of the November meteors, as they appeared at

Newcastle-on-Tyne on the morning of the 15th of November, 1871, was
communicated in a letter from Professor Herschel, in ' Nature ' of the 30th
of November :

    " Shortly before four o'clock on the morning of the 15th the clouds cleared
ofi", and the appearance of several meteors, one of which was as bright as
Jupiter, gave evident signs of the progress of the November star-shower.
The perfect clearness and darkness of the sky, in the absence of the moon, at
the same time gave especial brightness to the meteors and to their phospho-
rescent streaks. Between four o'clock and the first approach of daylight, at
six o'clock, thirty-two meteors were counted, or at the rate of sixteen per
hour, of which three were as bright, or brighter, than first-magnitude stars,
nine as bright as second, six as bright as third, and eight no brighter than
stars of the fom-th or lesser magnitudes. Twenty-six of these meteors were
directed from the usual radiant-point in Leo, which on this occasion, although
not very well defined, appeared to be approximately close to the star Zeta, in

Leo's sickle. About one half of their number left persistent streaks, which
sometimes appeared to grow brighter after the meteors had disappeared; and

I vainly endeavoured to bring them into the field of view of the direct-vision

prisms of a small spectroscope, the duration of the brightest streaks noted

Ascarcely ever exceeding one or two seconds.  very brilliant meteor, casting

around a flash like that of lightning, was seen here shortly after nine o'clock

on the evening of the 1 3th (and its appearance was also noted at Woodburn),

traversing the north-west sky. These particulars, imperfect as they were,

uufortunately, rendered by the cloudy weather, are the only descriptions of

the November star-shower which its appearance here has hitherto enabled

me to supply.

 --Meteor-shower of December 12th, 1871. Arrangements similar to those

made for observing the other meteor- showers of the past year were prepared
by the Committee in expectation of the return of the December meteors in
1871. On the evenings of the 5th and 9th, and on the night of the 12th and

13th, Mr. T. W. Backhouse recorded eighteen shooting-stars seen at Ilkley

in Yorkshire and at Sunderland, one of which on the 1st, and most of those

seen on the latter dates, were directed very nearly from the usual radiant-
point in Gemini. Three of those noted on the 5th proceeded from the Radiants

A ,._ ,g near Cassiopeia, the appearance of which in November and Decem-

ber has been supposed to be connected, not improbably, with the periodical re-
turns of Biela's comet. Although the clouded state of the sky prevented any

meteors from being seen at Sunderland during the hours appointed for obser-
vations on the evenings of the 11th, 12th, and 13th, three meteors from

Gemini were seen on the evening of the 11th, and two others during a short

watch on the morning of the 13th, when the sky was clear ; while only three

meteors unconformable to the same radiant-point were recorded by Mr. Back-

house during the time in which these five meteors of the December star-

shower were observed. On the nights following the pej-iodic dates, it will be

seen from his report that very few meteors directed from the well-known

radiant-point of this annual star-shower were observed. " On the 13th

[morning of the 14th] I watched for 25 minutes, about IB*" and 17'' (it was

equal to about 9 mirrutes' watch in a cloudless sky), and I only saw one

meteor ; it was not a ' Geminid.' On the 14th [morning of the 15th] I

watched for 45 minutes in a cloudless sky between 17"^ 15TM and 18" 21°\ and

saw nine meteors, all in the first 26 minutes. No radiant-point was, how-

ever, discernible ; one was a ' Geminid,' appearing at 17'' 36TM. It was of the
Afifth magnitude, and disappeared at | (tt Leonis, 15 Sextantis)."
                                                                    bright

meteor, described in the foregoing accounts of large meteors, directed appa-

rently from the radiant-point Aj^, was seen by Mr. Backhouse on the

evening of the last-named date.

   At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the sky was generally overcast on
the periodic nights, and only one small meteor, on the evening of the 12th,

unconformable to Gemini, was observed.

   At Hawkhurst the sky was occasionally cloudy on the evening of the 12th
until 11'', when it became quite clear, and a constant watch for shooting-stars
was kept between 10" 15TM p.m. and midnight. Thirty shooting-stars were
observed, of which fourteen were visible before 11 o'clock. The apparent
courses of twenty-six of these meteors projected iipon a map showed that
eight were unconformable to, and of the remaining number four appeared to
                                                                                --;

be very erratic members of, the group directed from the radiaut-poiut in
Gemini. Tiie tracks of fourteen (or 5-i per cent, of those mapped) jjrolouged
backwards passed through a small circle about 12° in diameter, having its
centre about 3° from Castor, towards d Gemioorum, at 11. A. 108°, N. Decl.
33°, which was the apparent centre of divergence of the shower. About
one-half of the " Geminids " were brighter than second-magnitude stars, and
two of the brightest left a persistent streak of light on their course. They

appeared white, and their apparent motion was, in general, not swift. On

the evening of the 13th the sky at Hawkhurst was completely overcast.
   At Tooting, near London, a watch for their a])pearance was kept for

1" 20"', between 9" 40'" and 11'' 20'", by Mr. H. W. Jackson ; the sky was

quite clear, and the ajjparent paths of seven meteors directed from Gcmiui
were recorded on a map. Prolonged backwards the tracks of these " Gemi-
nids " aU crossed a small circle not more than 8° or 10° in diameter, whose
centre was nearly midway between Castor and Pollux (slightly towards the
neighbouring star i Geminorum), at R. A. 112°, N. Decl. 30°. In his remarks
on this night's observations Mr. Jackson observes that his attention was

wholly given to recording the apparent courses of the meteors with exact-
ness, so that their a2)parent places of appearance and disappearance, as drawn

upon the map, were probably not more than half a degree in error either way
and all the meteors whose apparent paths were drawn upon the map were
satisfactorily well observed. No particular attention was according^ given

to the appearances of meteors from other radiant-points, nor to the various
characters of brightness, duration, and of leaving persistent streaks which

were presented by the Geminids that were observed. On the evening of the

13th the sky at Tooting was completely overcast.

   A definite radiant-point of the shower very near to the latter position

appears also to be indicated by the appearance of one of the meteors of the
December group, with a very short course, on the same evening, as observed

by Mr. W. F. Denning at Bristol. The sky was generally unfavourable for

observations on both evenings of the 12th and 13th of December ; but the
descent of a large meteor (as described in the foregoing list) was noted near
the western horizon at 9'' 42"", and three other meteors were seen during a
short interval of a quarter of an hour on the night of the 12th, when the
sky was clear, and a watch was kept by Mr. Denning for the return of the
December meteors. " At 10'' 3'" p.m. a small meteOr was seen. It was
evidently in close proximity to the radiant-point, its path being very short,
and not extending over more than one or two degrees. It diverged from
t Geminorum (about 4° S. of Castor), and was of momentary duration.
The direction of its extremely short path seemed to be towards the zenith.

   " At 10'' 18"" I saw a much brighter meteor. It emanated from Gemini,
and passed to the horizon in the south. One part of the path occupied a
place about 8° south of Bigel in Orion ; there was no tx'ain. Other meteors

were seen, but the exceedingly clouded state of the sky rendered it impossible

to note their paths."

   The following observation of a single meteor at Birmingham on the night
of the 13th, together with a notice of the appearance of the shower as

recently recorded there in previous years, was received from Mr. Wood :

At Buntingford, Herts, the only period clear enough for observations was

obtained by Mr. Greg between 9" 45'" and 11" 30'" p.m. on the night of the

12th, the sky on the night of the 13th of December being completely over-

cast. Fourteen meteors were seen, of which thirteen radiated from the direc-

tion of Gemini. They were mostly small, with short paths and moderate

velocities ; scarcely more than two or three sufficiently bright to have attracted

the attention of other observers at distant stations. The December star-
shower appears to be no longer so striking, either in size or in number of the

meteors, as it was eight or ten years since. The apparent velocities of the

meteors were also scarcely greater than half, or perhaps about 40 per cent,

less than those of the meteors of the August shower. The meteors noted by

Mr. Greg were principally those which moved with short courses near the

radiant-point. The backward prolongation of their tracks, projected upon a

map, are closely clustered round the star d Geminorum, which was the prin-

cipal radiant-point, with a tendency also to be concentrated along a line of

the meridian extending 5° or 6° north and south of that star, and principally

southwards from it towards, and apparently nearly as far as, the stars e and

V Geminorum, giving the radiant- region an oblong form, with its greatest

elongation in the direction of an arc of the mei-idian.

At York the condition of the sky was so unfavourable that scarcely one

meteor was visible during the whole of the December period. At Newcastle-

on-Tyne the sky was also completely overcast. At Glasgow rain continued

on the night of the 12th until ten o'clock, when the sky became clear, and

remained so for an hour until about 11" 30TM p.m., when it was again obscured.

During this interval seven meteors from Gemini, nearly equal to first-magni-

tude stars in brightness, were recorded, and their apparent paths were mapped

by Mr. R. M'^Clure. The first (described in the above list of large meteors),

which diverged like the rest from Gemini, was as bright as Jupiter ; and but
Aone meteor of the shower left a persistent streak.
                                                         Geminid was also

observed at 12" 20" on the same night, aud its apparent course was mapped.

The tracks of all these shooting-stars prolonged backwards passed through a

small circle about 12° in diameter, Avhose centre was close to the star c Gemi-

norum at a point in R. A. 97°, N. Deck 28°. Twenty meteors were counted

by two observers during the hour of the watch ; but the paths of only the most

conspicuous, which diverged from the direction of a radiant-point in Gemini,

were recorded upon the map. On the night of the 13th, rain, and a com-

pletely overcast state of the sky, prevented any further observations.

By projecting all the recorded paths of the Geminids upon a single map, a

path being very nearly conformable to the position of the radiant-point of the shovrer

radiant-region of oval form contained between the meridians of 11. A. 96° and

1 12°, and between the parallels of north declination 20° and 40°, would

include the directions of 37 of the 45 tracks which are thus drawn. In this

area the intersections of the tracks, prolonged backwards, are slightly more

concentrated than elsewhere within the radiant-space, at a point in R. A.

104°, N. Decl, 34°, about 4° from towards a Geminorum, while the general

character of the radiation was diffuse ; and the apparent paths of but few

meteors were recorded near the radiant-point.

 --Meteor-sJiower of Januarij 2nd~3rd, 1872. On these dates a watch was

arranged to be kept by observers in different places in England, and at

Glasgow from half-past 10 o'clock until midnight ; and a favourable view
of the shower was obtained at most of them on the night of the 2nd of

January.

Towards 11 o'clock a few detached clouds, which had partially' obscured

the sky in London during the earlier part of the evening of the 2nd of

January, disappeared, and the view of the shooting-stars during the re-

mainder of the watch until midnight was uninterrupted. In the neighbour-

hood of llegent's Park, Mr. T. Crumplen noted the appearance of nine

meteors in this interval, beginning his watch at lO"^ 45"\ and recorded the

apparent paths of six conformable meteors upon a map. Three of these were

as bright as first-magnitude stars. All but one, which appeared ruddy,

were white or bluish, not swift in their motion, and two of the brightest

left a short streak of light upon their course. The courses of all, prolonged

backwards, intersected each other within the space of a small circle 5° or 0°

in diameter, having its centre at R. A. 228°, N. Decl. 52°. So quickly did

bright meteors succeed each other, that it appeared probable that the shower

would continue to be of some brilliancy after midnight. An aurora was

visible at the same time in the north.

In the south-west part of London, near Eaton Square, the meteors were

also watched by Prof. Herschel, between lO** 30"' and midnight, the Hght

of the rising moon, which first appeared at about 11'' 30'° p.m., being the only

obstruction to their view. The paths of 16 shooting-stars were mapped, of

which only one appears to have been unconformable to the usual radiant-

point of the shower. It shot on a very short course close to Polaris from

the direction of the zenith at 11'' 7"', and was not perfectly observed. Four

or five smaller meteors may also have passed unrecorded. Six of the meteors

mapped were as bright or brighter than Ist-magnitude stars, the brightest ap-

pearing white and those of lesser magnitudes o£ yellow colour. The brightest

only of the meteors seen appeared to leave a faint streak of light, visible for

less than a second, on its course. This meteor described a path of 35° in two

seconds : it was as bright as Sirius during the last half of its course ; it
appeared at 11'' 56'", and its appearance was simultaneously observed at

Hawkhurst. Of the fifteen conformable meteors, five were erratic members of

the shower, their apparent paths, prolonged backwards, passing about 20" on

each side of a very definite radiant-point, from which the remaining ten

Ameteors all diverged.  circle of about 6° in diameter, round a central

point in E. A. 227°, N. Decl. 49°, would include the intersecting prolonga-

tions backwards of the tracks of all the latter meteors. This apparent place

of the radiant-point, which was close to that observed by Mr. Crumplen, is
also not more than 5° from the position of the radiant-point of the same

shower, at R. A. 234°, N. Decl. 51°, as observed in 1864 *. A slight

increase in the rate of frequency during the watch appears to indicate a

growing intensity in the progress of the shower, the numbers of the meteors

recoi'ded in the successive half-hours until midnight being 3, 5, and 8.

At Tooting, near London, the sky was also very clear on the evening of

the  2nd                     and  Mr.  H. W. Jackson  noted  the  appearances  of  nineteen  meteors
                          ;

between 10'' and 11'' p.m., the tracks of six of which were very accurately

laid down upon a map. Eight meteors were observed ; and the paths of two

of them were mapped between 11" and 11'' 15"", and only two meteors were

visible in the following 15'" until 11" 30"° v.u. The whole number of meteors

seen by one observer in 1" 30"' was 29. A bright meteor (described

in the above list), whose course was exactly conformable to the usual radiant-

point of 2nd of January shooting-stars, was also recorded by Mr. Jackson on

the night of the 31st of December. Although proceeding generally from

the direction of the radiant-region between Bootes and Draco, no definite

centre of divergence was distinguishable among the meteor-tracks recorded

at Tooting, which appear to have belonged to outlying members of the

group; and one of the eight meteors mapped was unconformable to the

general radiant-point of the shower. These meteors appeared for the most part

white ; they were generally bright, and left faint streaks upon their course,

which remained visible upon the track of one of the brightest 'for about one

Asecond.                     flash like lightning was observed at 10" 16'" p.m., and two

similar flashes were noticed between lO*" 16TM and 11" p.m.

At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the apparent paths and appear-

ances of fifteen meteors were registered between 10" 12'" and 11" 17"^, of
which four only were less bright than stars of the first magnitude, in a watch
partly kept by one and partly by two observers. They were mostly bluish,
but some yellowish white, and described apparent courses of from 10° to 40°

in length, in one or two seconds of time. Ten of the meteors recorded in the

list left more or less faint persistent streaks of light upon their course. Two

or three of the meteors whose apparent paths were tlius registered appear to
have been unconformable to the general radiant-point, and the tracks of the
remainder prolonged backwards present a sj^ace of somewhat diffuse radiation
in the region about Quadrans and the tail-stars of Ursa Major.

   The sky was also free from clouds at Hawkhurst on the night of the 2nd,
and a watch for the January shower was kept from 11" 20'" until midnight.
Fourteen meteors were noted in this interval, and the paths of ten were satis-
factorily observed, and were drawn upon a map. All were directed from the
neighbourhood of the radiant-point in Quadrans ; and the backward pro-

longation of their tracks presents a region of somewhat diff'use radiation,
extending over an area about 25° in diameter, having an apparent principal

centre of intersections at a point in about E,. A. 220°, N. Dec!. 47°. The
meteors seen were principally of the first and second magnitudes, white,

shooting across the sky in long courses, with moderately slow speed ; and
about half of their number left a slight persistent streak of light on the whole
or on a part of their course. Several smaller meteors passed unrecorded,
and the hourly numbers of the meteors seen was not less than twenty for
two observers.

   At Birmingham the sky was very clear on the night of the 2nd ; the

courses of fifteen or sixteen meteors were mapped ; and the appearances of

many more were noted by Mr. Wood during the hour between 10'' 15TM and

11" 15"" P.M. At 10" 17'" a flash like that of distant lightning (apparently
the same as that recorded by Mr. Jackson near London, and if so, probably
meteoric) was seen upon the south horizon during an interval of twenty
minutes after 10 o'clock, in which no shooting-stars were visible. At
102 REPORT--1872.

lO*" 20TM a meteor of fourth magnitude was seen, and at 10'' 21"" a sudden out-
burst of several bright varicoloured meteors made its appearance in all parts,

four or five shooting-stars being visible in the space of an eye-grasp, so that

it was impossible to I'ecord the particulars of more than one or two members

of this group. Two of them noted by Mr. Wood were brighter than first-

magnitude stars, leaving streaks, apparently not conformable to the usual

radiant-point of the January meteor-shower, but rather diverging in

nearly parallel courses from the radiant A, ^ in Cassiopeia, or one of them

NGpossibly from the radiant                                    in that neighbourhood. This burst of shooting-

stars gradually subsided, and meteors as bright as first- and second-magnitude

stars continued to succeed each other at short intervals until 10'' 49"", when

intervals of meteoric quiescence, unbroken by the ajjpearance of any shooting-

star for 10'", Hr"", and 20'", succeeded each other ; and the last meteors seen

during the watch were recorded at 10'' 59'" and 11'' 13'" p.m. Among twelve
meteors registered by Mr. Wood during the half hour between 10'' 20'" and

10'' 50'", two were as bright as, and five brighter than, first-magnitude stars,

and five left luminous streaks that remained visible for two or three seconds

on their course. In colour they were mostly blue, white, or yellow ; and the
duration of th'eir flight was generally from one second to about one second and

a half. Projected upon a map, the ajiparent courses appear to diverge from a

centre between the last stars in the tail of Ursa Major and a Draconis, several

of their visible tracks having been noted in or near the constellation Ursa

Major                                    but  many  scattered  meteors  were observed ;  and  in  the  following

A" Meteoric shoiver of Jannarif 2nd, 1872.                              fine shower of bright meteors,

at the rate of twenty per hour for one observer, radiating in the proportion

of 42 per cent, from K, [radiant of the annual shower],

   22 ,, from MG,

36 ,, distributed over the radiants A, ^, A,g, NG, DG.^, KG.

" Meteors of slow apparent speed, train-bearing, and varicoloured. The

time of maximum, the duration, and intensity of the shower could not be

ascertained in consequence of clouds supervening on the succeeding night.

The foregoing meteors were probablj- only a fragment of the shower."

  A description of the shower by Mr. .J. Morton, at Eccles, near Manchester,

was communicated to the Committee by Mr. W. F. Denning. It was first

noticed at 8'' 40"' p.m. on the 2nd, the sky being then very clear, but after-

wards becoming partially obscured by clouds. One bright meteor, leaving a

train of sparks, and five smaller ones were seen before 9 o'clock ; and eight

meteors of some brightness from that time until 10*" 23"' p.m. Six of the

fourteen meteors noted were as bright as second, and one was as bright as a

first-magnitude star.

   At Glasgow the sky was so hazy on the night of the 2nd, between
10'' 55'" and ll*" 20TM p.m., that Jupiter and the brightest fixed stars only

were visible ; but during the remainder of a watch from 10^ to 12'' p.m. the

sk}' was generaUy clear, and fourteen meteors were observed in this interval

by Mr. U. M''Clure. The apparent paths of nine of them were drawn upon a
map ; and of fhese meteors four were as bright as first-magnitude stars,

two were as bright, and the rest fainter than staT's of the second-magni-

tude. All but one, of reddish colour, which passed in a short course from

Ursa Major across the star Pollux, appeared Avhite ; and they described area
of from 5° to 20^ in lengtli, in times which varied from a half to a full

second in duration. Their tracks projected upon a map, altliougli proceeding,
as in the foregoing observations, from a general radiant-region near and
around the star Bootis, presented within that space no well-marked centre

of divergence.

   On the same night, and during the morning of January 3rd, as appears

from the following observations at York and Sunderland, the shower con-
tinued to be very bright, with occasional luUs and apparently outbreaks of
its intensity, imtil near the approach of daylight. At Sunderland Mr.
Backhouse reported that " though the night of the 2nd was for the most part
very fine, yet at the appointed time the sky was so cloudy that I only
watched for a short time, especially as meteors were so scarce. I only saw
one at that time ; but in the morning I watched for at least twelve minutes
in a cloudless but moonlit sky, the radiant-point in Draco being high in the
sky, yet I saw no meteor belonging to that sj'stem, and only one altogether.
The evening of the 3rd was fine till about 10'' p.m., when it clouded over.
I did not see a single meteor, though I watched for about ten minutes at
6"' 30", and equally long about 9" 15"."

   Another considerable outburst of the shower must, however, have occurred
shortly before daybreak on the morning of the 3rd, as the brilliancy and rapid

succession of the meteors at that time at Street, Somersetsliire, attracted a
child's attention, who, as related by Mr. Clark, informed him of some of the

particulars of their appearance. " The nights, both of the 2nd and 3rd, were

so unfavourable as to prevent me from sending you any observations. On
the morning of the 3rd, however, I had an account from my nephew, who

though but eight years old is intelligent enough to take a good deal of
interest in simple scientific things, of several meteors which he had seen,
coming rapidly after one another, and evidently somewhat bright."

   On the following evening, and night of the 3rd to the 4th of Januarj"-, the

sky was so completely overcast at all the British- Association stations that
no shooting-stars could be observed ; but on that evening a single meteor, as
brilliant as Jupiter (as described in the above list), was observed at Green-
wich, the direction of whose apparent course was almost exactly directed
from the radiant-point K3 in Quadrans (Bode, or in the region of Draco
between Hercules and Bootes), which distinguishes the annually recurring

--meteor-shower of the lst-3rd of January.
   Meteoric showers of April, 1S72. Some observations of the April star-
shower in 1871, not included in last year's Report, were obtained by Mr.
Clark, at York, with a clear view of the sky, from shortly before ten

o'clock until midnight on the night of the 19th of April in that year. Six
rather bright meteors, with very short courses of only a few degrees in
length near the constellation Ursa Major, were mapped, belonging apparently

to the meteoric system or group of radiant-points M^ in that constellation.
One meteor from the direction of Lyra was also seen before eleven o'clock, and

--six between eleven o'clock and midnight, the .sky being equally clear, the

numbers of meteors of all kinds seen in the former hour being six, and in the
latter nine. The sky was overcast on the other nights of the shower.

--104 REPORT 1872.

April last by the appearance of some conspicuously blight meteors, to whose

characteristic brilliancy Mr. J. E. Clark drew particular attention in the

following communication to ' Nature ' of May 2nd, 1872 (the meteors

alluded to by Mr. Clark are described in the foregoing list):

   " I noticed in your Number of last week the account of a brilliant meteor

observed in Cumberland on April 19th. Now 1 had reported to me a very

similar meteor at nearly the same time (about 8^ 40" p.m.), an account of

which I forwarded, with the other results of my night's watch, to Mr. A. S.

Herschel,  who  would  gladly  receive  any further  report  of    the  same                               un-
                                                                                                        ;

fortunately I have not the Number of 'Nature' at hand, and therefore

cannot make a personal application to your correspondent. On the same

evening, about 11'' 7."\ I myself saw an exceedingly brilliant meteor, which

fell to a point just south of Vega. It is curious that both of these came

from the radiant situated at about R. A. 155°, N. Uecl. 47°, or rather from

one of the group of radiants there situated, M^ of Heis, 56 and 52 of Schia-

parelli. It would be an interesting point of investigation whether the

--meteors from that radiant-point are of peculiar brightness." J. E. Clark,

April 30th, 1872.

The meteor seen by Mr. Clark at York was seen at the same time at

Hawkhurst ; and the direction of its apparent i>ath there, prolonged back-

wards, meets its similarly prolonged track, as observed at York, near ^ UrsiB
Majoris, very near the position of the radiant-point M^. The bright meteors

described in the above list on April 5lh and 19th, and May 3rd, appear all

to have diverged from the same group of meteor-radiants in Ursa Major.

Those recorded on March 26th, April 12th and 22nd, radiated from centres

of a group of apparently equally bright meteor-showers, S^_ g_ ^, in the neigh-
bourhood of Virgo and Comae Berenices.

   On the evenings of the 12th, 13th, and 14th of April, 1872, Mr. Greg

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  '

watched at Buntingford, Herts, for an early appearance of the April meteor-

showers from the direction of Cerberus or Lyra (QHj, QH.,), connected to-

gether apparently in one meteor-system making its appearances on the 13th

and 19th-20th of April. The former radiant-point was noted from the paths

of nine small shooting-stars, seen in about two hours on the morning of the

13th of April, 1864, by Prof. A. S. Herschel at Hawkhurst* ; and no appear-

ance of this shower appears to have been again visible in subsequent years.

Its radiant position at E. A. 270°, N. Decl. 25°, was yet distinctly marked,

the meteors resembling each other even more closely than those of the group

from Lyra in their appearance, and moving in swift courses over all parts of

the sky from a region of somewhat diffuse radiation, extending to but not

exceeding the limits of the small constellation Cerberus (Bode), with an

average centre at about the position named. By its close neighbourhood to

the well-established radiant-point of the LyraVds at about R. A. 278°, N. Decl.

34°-5 1, it appears to have been an early commencement of that shower, and
an integral part of the meteor-system which was first shown by Drs. Weiss and

D' Arrest to be apparently connected with the periodic orbit of the Comet I,

1861. Mr. Greg's watch for the early reappearance of the group on the

above date was unsuccessful, two small meteors only being observed from the

DGradiant  (in the head of Draco), and two meteors radiating from the

direction of /j Hcrculis, during a very careful watch on each of the above-
named nights.

uing informed the Committee that 'Sir. Kiiobel, at Burton-on-Treut, had

observed " many meteors in April, particularly on April 14th, 1872. They

appeared to radiate from a point in ]3ootcs east of ^ Eootcs." This point,

which is very near to /j Herculis, was nearly in the direction of the last two

meteors seen by Mr.  Greg,  and  in the position  of       the general  radiant Q,   *

                                                                                    ,,

of meteors first beginning to be seen about the 23rd of April, but which

appears from these observations to present itself close to the same position at

least ten days earlier, on about April 12th. (See the Table at the end of

this llcport. Eadiant, No. 51.)

The night of tire 19th of April, 1872, was generally not iinfavourable for

observations at most of the British-Association stations. At York, until

nearly 11** r.ir., the sk'y was nearly overcast ; but at that hour the clouds

began to disperse, and soon after the beginning of the watch they had finallj-

disappeared. During the succeeding interval between 10'' 45'" and 11'' 45"^

r.M. nine meteors, two of tliem as bright and two brighter than fii'st-mag-

nitude stars, were observed, six being visible in the first and only three

meteors, Avith two or three faint flashes near a Lyra?, in the last 45'" of the

watch. From 11'' to 11'' 15'" there seemed to be quite a brisk shower, but

after that time their rate of fall diminished considerably. The Ly raids were

all noticeably rapid in their flight, their courses varying from 5° to 2-5° in

length, and the duration, even of the longest, scarcely exceeding half a

second. They were colourless or white, and there was a noticeable absence

of streaks upon their course. Two or three meteors diverged from a radiant,

No. 53 of Schiaparelli, in Comte Berenices, apparently connected with the

radiant S^ ., near the same constellation, in Virgo, of Heis ; others from M^
and five of the nine shooting-stars whose courses were mapped were Lyraids.

The brightest of these appeared at 11'' 28°^, and its apparent course was also

noted at Wisbeach and at Hawkhurst. The radiation of the Lyraids was

not very exact ; but the courses of three, prolonged backwards, intersected

each other very nearly at a point in II. A. 280°, N. Decl. 43°, near tt Lyra?.

Some further observations on the progress of the shower will shortly be given

from Mr. Clark's report of its appearance.
   At Buntingford a clear sky prevailed on tlie 19th, between 11'' 15"' and

12"' 45'", and the apparent paths of seven meteors of first and second mag-
nitudes, all of them meteors of the April shower, were drawn upon a map
by Mr. Greg. The backward prolongation of their tracks, which were

generally not far from the radiant-point, presented a very definite area of
intersections 3° or 4° in width, at about B. A. 268°, N. Decl. 25°, in Cerberus.

--Their courses were generally short ; and the following is Mr. Greg's description

of their appearance : " Owing to the moon being so bright the tracks were
rendered rather shorter and the trains less visible than they woidd otherwise
have been, besides causing me, no doubt, to miss seeing a number of others.
Certainly there was distinctly a sliower going on which was not visible on

the evenings of the 12th, 13th, and 14th. Five only of the seven were very
white ; their average brightness was that of a first- or second-magnitude star,
and owing to the shortness of their apparent paths their duration was under,

if any thing, half a second. The radiants QHj [of meteors on the 12th-13th,
in Cerberus] and QH, [of the Lyraids on the 19th-20th of April] appear to
me to be simply one and the same shower, with a slight difterence in the
dates and in the positions of the radiant-points." The sky was quite over-

cast at Buntingford on the night of April 20th.
   At Mr. Crumplen's station in London the sky was remarkably clear, but

106 REPORT--1872.

only three meteors radiating from near a Lyrte, and iu the neighbourhood of
that constellation, were observed in a watch of three quarters of an hour, at
about 11 o'clock on the evening of the 19th. The first of these was as bright
as a first-magnitude star, leaving a streak of light iipon its course which re-

mained visible for nearly a second. On the night of the 20th, soon after

10 o'clock, the sky was entirely overcast.
   At Bristol, on the 19th, few stars were visible between lO** and 11'', the

sky being very cloudy, excepting for a few minutes in the north-east, at about

eleven o'clock, when one conspicuous meteor and one small one only were
seen by Mr. Denning. The former rather bright meteor is described in the

above list.

   At Birmingham a hazy state of the sky also prevailed on the 19th, and
strong fuU-moon light on this and the following evenings only permitted a
single meteor to be seen. The scarcity of meteors on the latter night during
an hour's attentive watch was, however, fully confirmed by the other obser-
vations which will shortly be described.

   On account of the overcast state of the sky no observations on these dates

were obtained at either Glasgow, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, or Sunderland.

  A list of six meteors seen at Wisbeach between 10" 45'" and 11" 30"' p.m. on

the 19th, with a tracing of their apparent courses on a map, was received
from Mr. S. H. Miller, with the following remarks on their appearance :
" There was a remarkable accordance in their direction, and No. 6 seemed to
take the same path as No. 5. The brightness of the moon interfered with
the observations of their colour, and also of the length of their path, especially
as they were small, and their trains of light a thin streak. I did not see one
on the 20th, although I kept a persistent watch." In reply to a later in-
quiry on the latter point, Mr. Miller adds, " The sky was clear on the night
of the 20th, during the hour I watched, and had there been any meteors
then, I think I must have seen them; but after 11" 30"' it became cloudy,
and there was rain on the next morning early."

   On the night of the 19th, at Hawkhurst, the sky M'as very clear, the moon-

light bright, and a faint aurora was visible in the north. Between 11 o'clock
and 12" 15'", four observers counted 16 meteors, whose apparent courses were
more or less exactly recorded. Ten of these meteors were seen in the first,
and six in the last half of the watch, and nine were as bright as, or brighter

than, Ist-magnitude stars. Two of the brightest meteors mapped were also

simultaneously observed at York, and one of them diverging from Lyra was
at the same time recorded at Wisbeach. Nine of the sixteen meteor-tracks
were directed with no distinct centre of radiation from a space between
a Lyrse and Z Herculis, and the remaining meteor-tracks were nearly equally
distributed in their directions from the radiant-points AVG(?) in Cygnns,
Sj,5 iu Yirgo and Comse Berenices, Qj,, in Corona, and M, in Ursa Major.
OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS.                       107

The ouly meteor from the latter radiant-point (near the zenith) was the very

brilliant one seen to fall vertically elsewhere, and described as proceeding
from the same radiant-point by Mr. Clark, at York. The Lyraids appeared

white and swift, and generally left no streak ; but when seen foreshortened

near the radiant-point they sometimes appeared bluish or yellowish, and left
persistent streaks. The sky was overcast on the night of the 20th, and no

meteors were observed.
   At the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, during an interval of clear sky on

the 19th, between half-past ten and half-past eleven o'clock, six meteors
were registered by one observer of Mr. Glaisher's staff, of which three -vyere
as bright as first-magnitude stars, and four diverged from the neigh-
bourhood of o Lyrae. The Lyraids were all bluish white, with short appa-

rent paths, leaving streaks. On the night of the 20th, the sky at the Eoyal

Observatory, Greenwich, was too cloudy for further observations of the April

shower.

   During the night of the 19th of April, it appears, from observations which

wore continued at the lladcliffe Observatory at Oxford, by Mr. Lucas, until
the appearance of daybreak, that the activity of the April meteor-shoAver was
very brightly maintained until the morning of April 20th. During a strict
watch kept for shooting-stars on that morning from I'' a.m. until 4'' a.m., the
sky was quite clear during the. first hour, and only crossed occasionally by
clouds from the south-west dm-iug the last two hours of the watch. Towards

4 o'clock a.m., the brightness of the full-modn light gave way to that of the
approaching dawn ; and a thick haze beginning at this time to overspread the
sky, at length obscured aU but a few stars of the first and second magnitudes.

The appearances of twenty-six meteors were recorded ; five in the first, five

in the second, and sixteen during the last hour of the watch ; the numbers

of Ist-magnitude shooting-stars visible in the same times being two, one, and

six. Seventeen of all the meteors noted were Lyraids, of which the numbers

recorded during the same times were four, three, and ten. Six of the Lyraids

were as bright as first, and six as bright as second-magnitude stars, and they

appeared white even in the strong moonlight. Their courses were generally

very rapid, sometimes 20° or 30° in length, and occasionally leaving a per-

sistent streak. Of the nine remaining meteors, all but two proceeded appa-

rently from a radiant-point in Cygnus eastward from that in Lyra, not far
WGfrom the position in May and June of a radiant-point
                                                        in that constel-

lation ; four courses prolonged backwards intersect each other close to e Cygni,
near which one of these unconformable meteors also moved with a short ap-

parent path. The brightest meteor seen during the watch moved from_ the

direction of e Cygni, bursting when it had reached the brightness of Jupiter,
on a long course from y Cassiopeia; nearly to Capella ; its duration was two

seconds, and it was followed by the next meteor, which appeared as bright

as a 2nd-magnitude star, moving upon exactly the same course. Two other

unconformable meteors were directed from the radiant-points S^j in Yirgo

and Comae Berenices.
   The tracks of the seventeen Lyraids, prolonged backwards, all passed

through a region of radiation including the chief stars of Lyra and the stars

$, o Herculis, where a circular area, about 15° in diameter, with its centre at
E. A. 275°, ]Sr. Decl. 32°, would include all the directions of the LyraVds that
were observed, and was probably very near the central point of divergence of

the group. The radiant-point being near the zenith when the Lyraids were
most numerous in the last hour of the watch, and their courses extending

round it towards all parts of the sky, this apparent place of the radiant-point,
                                                                                                           I2

although not definitely marked bj' exact intersections of their apparent paths,
yet appears to be the best average position of the somewhat diffuse centre of
divergence which they appear to have presented that was obtained during
the last annnal reappearance of the April meteors.

   The notable absence of meteors on the evening of April 20th, after the
somewhat considerable star-shower that was seen at most of the stations on
the preceding night, was especially remarked by Mr. Clark, who described the
following particulars of the watch which he kept at York for the appearance

--of any continuation of the meteor-shower which might be visible on the

second night : " Tlie watch on Saturday the 20th was altogether unsuccessful.
I commenced a few minutes before 10'', and was joined at IC' 25'" by Mr.
Brown, when for about ten minutes a cirrus cloud from the cast obscured
two thirds of the sky, and we were driven in by a snow-storm from the north
at 11'' 10"' ; after which I did not watch, as it remained more or less cloudy.
However, during that period of nearly an hour and a quarter, for half the
time tivo tvatching, we did not see with certainty a single meteor. Such a
remarkable absence of them I have never noticed before. To be sure the
moon was brilliant, but not so brilliant as to obscure 4th-magnitude stars."

  --Meteoric SJioivcr of May 1872. Some preparations which were made by

the Committee to watch for the appearance of any star-shower or conspicuous

meteors on the nights of the 17th, 18th, and 19th of May, when such have

been occasionally observed, wore entirely frustrated by a constant succession of
wet and cloudy weather. During the hour appointed for observation on the
evening of the 20th of May, Mr. Miller watched, with a tolerably clear view
of the sky, at Wisbeach, Avithout seeing any meteors.

   A single bright meteor of the shower was seen at Newcastle-on-Tyne, in

an interval of clear sky for about twenty minutes, on the night of Maj^ 17th-
18th, at 12*' 10'" (midnight) by Professor Herschel. It resembled a Lyra) in
brightness and colour, and passed in two seconds from between ^, ?; Draconis
to between 'C, t} Ursa) Majoris, beginning its course 5° before, and ending it
5° beyond those stars, and leaving a bright streak upon its whole track,
which remained visible, even in the bright moonlight, for one or two seconds.

The meteor's motion was apparently from the radiant DG^ in Draco, and was

not conformable to the principal radiant-group in Corona and Hercules (Q,,^
of this meteoric epoch.

   A pamphlet of printed instructions to observers of shooting-stars for tlie

year 1 872-73 has been circulated among astronomers and the associated ob-
servers of shooting- stars in Italy by Professor Schiaparelli «nd Signor F.
Denza, appointing five or six nights in each month for combined observations,
together with a list of nights in the whole year for which not more than
twenty meteor-tracks were recorded by Zezioli. Observers at fourteen
Italian stations are engaged in these observations ; and the Italian Luminous

Meteor Association have already recorded the apparent paths of 6151 meteors
in 1870, and of 10,257 meteors in 1871, which have been projected upon
suitable maps for exhibiting the radiant-points which they present. It is
intended to print these maps so as to exhibit the positions and characters of
the different radiant-points, with their dates of appearance, as clearly and
conveniently as possible to the eye. The star-maps employed by the Asso-
ciation of Italian observers are constructed upon the same projection as the
well-known Celestial Atlas of Professor Dorna of Turin. The observations

of shooting-stars made at the observatory of Moncalieri contiiuie to be pub-

lished in the Meteorological Bulletin of that observatory, in which nearly

1000 meteor-paths observed before the end of April 1869 have been already

published. All the observers' notes are also transmitted to Milan for final

reduction and arrangement in a collective Catalogue by Professor Schiaparelli.

In connexion with this extensive research, an enlarged edition of his ori-

ginal Memoir on the Astronomical Theory of Shooting-stars* has recently

been compiled by Professor Schiaparelli, and was published last year under

his directions, as a separate volume, in the German language by Dr. vou

Boguslawski, of Stettin f. The materials of the original Treatise have been
much increased, so as to present a full account of the recent investigations in

meteoric science whose results have most contributed to advance this modern

Abranch of astronomj^ since the publication of his former work.  complete

Table of all the 189 radiant-points obtained from Zezioli's observatiousj,

the full particulars of Avhich have not been previously published, is also em-

bodied in the work, with a supplementary Table showing the position of each

radiant-point with regard to the apex of the earth's way, and the principal

elements of its parabolic or cometary orbit. In a list of notes on the several

radiant-points, a comparison of their positions with those obtained by other

observers, showing them in many cases to corroborate or to correct former

observations, is made to connect the new list of radiant-points in every im-

portant point of agreement with the older lists of Heis, Greg, and Schmidt,

and with the separate determinations of special radiant-points by individual

Aobservers.  useful summary of these results is given by Mr. Greg in the

accompanying comparative Table of radiant-points, presenting in one view aU

the points of difference and resemblance between the several general cata-

logues of radiant-points which have hitherto been published, with the excep-

tion of the extensive Catalogue recently printed by Dr. Schmidt in the second

volume of the publications of the Observatory of Athens, to which the Com-

mittee have not yet been able to refer §. With the aid of observations received

since the appearance of the last printed Meteor-Catalogue in these Reports,

the Committee propose to consider more closely the epochs and positions of

the general radiant-points exhibited in this Table, and to enter in a future

Report into a complete discussion of the identity and of the comparative im-

portance of the difi:erent families or groups of meteoric showers which, in

many instances, it appears most properly to represent.

   AI Table of the principal meteor-showers only of this later list was formerly pub-

lished by Professor Schiaparelli (v/dc Eeport for 1870, p. 1)8), with sliglit subsequent alte-
rations in two Memoirs in the Ephemerides of the Milan Observatory, containing annota-
tions on the history and characteristics of each meteor-shower of the List, one memoir in-
cluding the meteor-showers observed in each half year. That for the first half year was

noticed in the last Report (1871, pp. 44-48), and the concluding Memoir has since been
received by the Committee from Prof. Schiaparelli. To this complete cycle of meteor-
showers, and to the descriptive notes wliich it contains, fiu-ther consideration will be devoted

in the next Report.

Experiments on the Surface-friction experienced by a Plane moving

                 through water. By W. Eroude^ F.R.S.

     [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be i^rinted in exfcnso.]

The object of these experimeuts is to discover the couditions of the resistance

to passage through the water caused to models or ships by the friction of the
water against the sides.

This has been investigated by towing, with the dynamometric apparatus,

planes formed of thin boards                                                                                                      these being bodies of such a form as to possess

the least possible displacement, and present to the line of motion the least

possible sectional area, compared to the amount of wetted skin, and at the
same time, owing to their flotation, capable of being made stable and self-

supporting in the water, though entirely submerged.

The dynamometric arrangement is as follows :--

The water space is a parallel-sided tank 278 feet long, 36 broad at the top,

and  10 feet deep                                              but for the surface-friction                                                          experiments  it was  necessary

to lower the water-level about 15 inches.

   The tank is roofed from end to end, and a light railway, carried by the
framing of the roof, traverses its entire length at about 20 inches above the
normal water-level, there being a clear space between the rails, the gauge
of which is independent of sleepers or transomes.

  A stout framed truck, suspended from the axles of two pairs of wheels, runs

on the railway, and is moved by an endless wire rope, coiled in a spiral

groove on an accurately turned barrel, which is driven by a small double-

cylinder engine, hanng a heavy and highly speeded fly-wheel, and a ehro-

120 REPORT 1H72.

The lower edge consisted of a quasi keel of lead of the same thickness as the

plane, and made heavy enough to nearly neutralize the flotation of the light
Avood of which the planes were made. But though thus made stahle, and

approximately neutralized as to flotation, the jjlane under experiment required

control to keep it resolutely vertical, and the line of its length correctly

horizontal, while, nevertheless, it required perfect liberty in the line of motion,

in order that the whole towing-strain might be accurately delivered to the

dynamometer.
   For this purpose a light but stiffened wooden bar (Plate II. c c) Avas hung

longitudinally beneath the dynamometer truck, just clear of the surface of the

water. To this the planes were rigidly attached. This bar was carried at

each end by a light swing or rocking-frame (e e and e e) , thus forming a
parallel motion perfectlj* free longitudinally, and perfect^ unyielding trans-

versely. It was of course necessary to extend one of the swings above the

point of suspension to carry a weight adjusted so as to counterbalance the

weight of the bar, together with any sinking or floating force that the plane
might exert ; otherwise the frame would not have been in equilibriimi in the
line of motion except in one position, and in any other position would have

exerted a positive or negative force on the dynamometer.

   The rigid connexion between the planes (which were of course imder
water) and the swinging bar or parallel motion (which was above water)

consisted of a kind of sheath or cutwater (n d), which received the forward
edge of the plane, and had a long upper end, extending out of the water, and

fastened to an upright on the swinging bar with three strong pins or bolts.

The plane was rebated to receive tlie sides of the sheath, so that the outside

surface at the juncture was flush as far as possible.

Tlie investigation of surface-friction may be separated into three primary

--divisions :  (1)  the law of the  variation  of  resistance witli  the  velocity                              (2)
                                                                                                             ;

the differences in resistance due   to  differences in the quality of     surface                               (3)
                                                                                                          ;

the differences in the resistance per unit of surface due to differences in the

length of surface.

   The necessity of investigating the latter of these conditions may not be at

once apparent, it having been generallj' held that surface-friction varies

directly with the area of surface, and will be the same for a given area,

wliether the surface be long and narrow or short and broad. It has always

seemed to me to be impossible that this should be the case, because the por-

tion of surface that goes fii'st in the line of motion, in experiencing resistance

from the water, must in turn communicate to the water motion in the direc-

tion in which it is itself travelling ; and consequently the portion of siirface

which succeeds the first will be rubbing, not against stationary water, but

against water partially moving in its own direction, and cannot therefore
experience as much resistance from it. If this reasoning holds good, it is

certain that doubling, for instance, the length of a surface, though it doubles

the area, would not double the resistance, for the resistance of the second

half would not be as great as that of the first.

In order to reduce the results obtained to the most serviceable form for

determining the three separate conditions of resistance enumerated above,

it was convenient to represent them graphicallj^, by diagram, in two methods
in both methods the ordinates represent resistance, whUe the abscissfc repre-

sent in the one case velocities, and in the other lengths of surface. Plates VI. and

VII. are instances^of the two kinds. In the former, if the friction proved to

vary as the square of the velocity, the diagrams would be ordinarj^ parabola;

originating at the zero-point of resistance and velocity; in the latter, if the

                    EXPERIMENTS ON SURFACE-FRICTION.                    121

friction per iiuit of surface were uniform, as is common] j' supiwscd, through-

out the length of the surface, and consequently the total resistance of a plane

of given Avidth varied simply as the length, the diagrams M'ould be straight

lines, originating at the zero-point of both horizontal and vertical scale. If,

again, these lines were straight, but apparently originated at a point above

the zero, this would indicate that there was a constant clement of resistance

throughout (such as head-resistance might be), in addition to the element

varying as the length. If, however, the lines were concave towards the base,

this would indicate that the friction per unit of surface decreased with in-

creasing length of surface.

Since each plane, when once mounted, was, for convenience, tried through-

out the intended series of velocities, the results primarily shaped themselves

in the first-mentioned form. Some transcripts of the resuUs as originally so
'^lotted are shown on Plate IV., the lines on which represent the actual resist-

ances for any veloci'y of certain planes under certain differences of condition

as specified in the margin of the sheet. The cross mprks upon the lines show

the actual spots decided by the individual experimei cs made, and from which.

the curves drawn were deduced. It may be remarked that, wi.h the excep-

tions which will be subsequently noticed (the lines marked b' b', c' c') , there
is scarcely any difference between any of the lines in respect to the law of

variation of resistance in terms of velocity, the resistance varying throughout

nearly as the power 1-8 of the velocity.

From the great multiplicity of the experiments tried, it would have been

confusing to show even a tolerable large proportion of the origiual reductions.

Those given are selected, partly as exhibiting the results of certain sligl tly

varied conditions which will be presently referred to, and partly as fairly

averaged specimens which instructively attest the accuracy of the experiments.

This is shown, not only by the fairness of the curves passing strictly through.

all the spots, but also by the consistency of the contiguous lines.

The results which had been thus reduced to diagram according to the first

of the two methods supplied the data for constructing a general diagram

according to the second method, as shown in Plate VII. The black Hues on

this figure express the finally analyzed and complete results, for one quality

of surface only, up to a length of 50 feet, that beijig the greatest length that

the apparatus can command. It appeared desirable to ascertain the effect of

length of surface (at any rate provisionally) before proceeding to try various

qualities of surface ; and the process by which these results, as given in the

diagram, were finally arrived at requires some explanation.

I commenced by a series of experiments on planes of various lengths, from

one foot to fifty feet, having all a similar surface.

The results of this first series of experiments, when analyzed, gave lines

similar to the dotted line (« a) on Plate VII. This, it will be seen, is con-

cave towards the base, thus indicating that the friction per unit of surface

does actually diminish as the length of surface increases. At the same time

its form, as it approached the zero of speed, seemed to show, either that this

effect was very much more marked in the first two feet of surface, or that
there was considerable body-resistance involved. Moreover, the line obtained,

if drawn strictly through all the spots determined by experiment, did not

give a fair curve.

This might have been thought to be owing to inaccuracy in the apparatu.?,

were it not that experiments, when repeated, always gave identical results,

and that, as has been already mentioned, the results for each individual plane

were perfectly harmonious, thus indicating that the discrepancy in question

122 REPORT--1872.

arose from small differences between the individual planes, probably differences
 in the thickness or nature of edge at their ends, diminishing or increasing the

 body-resistance.

    The initial edge of the planes tried was formed by the sheath or cutwater
befoi-e mentioned, which held the plane in its place; and this was tapered in
horizontal section, fron? tbe thickness of the plane to about jL inch, the
extreme edge being rounded, as shown full size in Plate III. (marked a a).
At the tail edge there was no sheath, and the board was simply cut off square,
as shown in the same figure. Clearly, if there was any great body-resistance
due to these blunt ends, as the line a a on Plate VII. seemed to imply, then
the slight differences in thickness which existed between the different planes
might be sufficient to account for the discrepancies between their results.
Accordingly experiments were tried with certain of the planes, of various

lengths, already tried, but substituting a cutwater having a very thin edge,
tapering to the thickness of the plane in 6 inches, as shown in horizontal
section on Plate III. (marked b). This alteration produced a slight diminu-
tion in the amount of the resistance of all the planes, but rather a greater

reduction in the short planes than in the long ones. The difference, though
almost too small to show, is indicated by the line a! a', Plate VII. Experiments
were then tried with the tail edges of the planes, tapered in the same manner
as the initial edge (c, Plate III). This was tried with the result (indicated by
the plain line a, Plate VII.) of a ver}- much larger reduction in the resistance
and this reduction was likewise relatively greater in the shorter lengths.

    In order still more correctly to obtain a value by which the results of all
the planes already tried might be corrected for the varying thicknesses of
their after edges, an experiment was tried with one of the thickest planes
(2 feet 6 inches long) by reducing the thickness of its square-edged tail to
that of the thinnest of the planes (a reduction of perhaps -^^ inch). The
results of this are shown on Plate V., where the resistance of the plane with
the thick after edge is shown by the line marked a'", and the resistance of
the same plane with the tail thinned by the line marked a", and that with
the tail tapered to a perfectly sharp edge by the line a.

    It is worth notice on this point that the difference between the reduction
of resistance found throughout these experiments on sharpening the tail edge,
and that foiuid on sharpening the initial edge, seems to be entirely owing to
the difference between the original foi-ms of the blunt cutwater and the blunt
tail (the former being partly tapered and rounded, while the latter was cut
quite square). This was proved by trying the above-mentioned 2-feet 6-inch
plane, with its after edge sharpened like the original blunt cutwater. These
results are shown on Plate V. by the dotted lines a' a', a a, from which it

may be seen that the difference between the rounded edge and the perfectly

sharp edge is comparatively small.

   The application of the corrections obtained as I have here described to the
results of the experiments previously made gave diagrams of resistance in
terms of length similar to the line marked a" a", Plate VII., the discrepancies
between the jolanes disappearing when thus corrected. But these experi-
ments did not include any made with shorter planes than 1 foot 6 inches,
that being the shortest length that could be constructed with the existing
cutwater ; and in order to make it complete, it was most desirable to extend
the lines as far as possible towards the zero-point of length and of resistance,
by trying very short and thin planes, so as to test the nature of the curve
close to the origin, and discover whether any body-resistance remained owing

to the thickness of the plane hitherto tried.
EXPEIUMENTS ON SURFACE-FRICTION.  123

    It was also necessary to eliminate certain other constant resistances known

 to exist, namely, that due to the air-resistance on the swinging bar, that duo
 to the excess of surface of the cutwater, owing to its projecting up through
 the water above the upper edge of the planes, and that due to the projections
 and irregularities on its surface, caused by the fastenings of the planes. Of
 tliese, the air-resistance was obtained by direct experiment; that due to
 excess of surface was calcidable on the data already possessed ; and the
 resistance due to the projections <fec. was determined by trying the 1-foot
 G-inch plane, with its surface smoothed up Avith paraffine and varnished as

before. The deduction of these constants brought down the line to the plain
lines shown on Plate VII.*

    But the first-mentioned object, that of deciding the friction of very short
lengths, I have so far been unable to treat quite satisfactorily, owing to the
 difficulty of guiding very thin blades. I have, however, obtained good
results with a 12-inch blade and a 6-iucli blade (see Plate III. d, e) sharp on
both edges, both about similar in longitudinal section to the 1-foot 6-inch
plane ; and the experiments with these gave spots through which the curves
on Plate VII. were drawn for the first 1-foot 6-inch length of surface.

   And though, in the absence of any successful experiment with blades of
different thicknesses but the same length, we can scarcely regard as disproved

the existence of possible body-resistance due to the thickness, slight as it was,
of the planes tried, it is obvious that it would be difficult to deduct further
from the diagram of resistance any considerable constant represer iing this,
without making the friction per unit of surface decrease with increasing
length less in the first 6 inches than it would be uacurally expected to do

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

in other words, without making the curvature of the lines on Plate VII. less
sharp at their origin than would be expected, seeing that in the rest of the
diagram the curvature becomes rapidly flatter as the lengths of plane become
greater ; but indeed the thinness of the planes and the smallness of the : e-
duction of resistance which followed the substitution of knife-like for rounded
edges render it almost impossible to credit body-resistance with any appre-
ciable item in the account. It is also most desirable to extend these experi-
ments to greater lengths of surface than I have been able to try with this
apparatus. But it would indeed be almost impossible to do so in the experi-
ment tank ; and I shall endeavour to organize some arrangement by which

greater lengths may be successfully tried in open water.

    I have thus far confined myself, in the description of the result, to the

question of the eff'ect of lengths of surface upon resistance. I have now to

deal with the question of quality of surface.

   The diiferent surfaces tested may be enumerated as follows :--

                  Shellac varnish.

                Hay's composition.

                 Peacock's composition.

                 Tallow.

                  Glue.

          A smooth metal surface obtained by a coating of tinfoil.

   The comparison between the first three named was made with planes 5 feet,
16 feet, and 50 feet long, which were each coated first with Hay's and sub-

sequently with Peacock's composition, all the planes having been previously

   * It should be noticed, however, that the scale of resistance shown on Plate VII. gives,
not the actual resistances due to the planes tried, but the reduced resistance due to a,
surface one foot wide and of the lengths shown,

                                                                  k2

tried as coated -vritli shellac varnish. The comparison between the shellac and
the Hay's composition is exhibited in Plate IV., in Avliich the plain lines
marked a, c, and n represent the result with the shellac, and the dotted lines
marked a', c', and n' that with the Hay's composition. These two results I

consider practically identical, since such small difference as is observable
might possibly arise from some other difference in the condition of the plane
and it is observable that with the 5-foot plane n, d' the scarcely perceptible

difference is opposite in character to that shown by a', a and b', b.
    The results with Peacock's composition are not shown in Plate V., being

practically identical with the other two.

    The tallow surface was tried on the 10-foot plane onlj-, and gave no diffe-
rence, the diagrams falling between that of the shellac and that of Hay's

composition.

    The glued surface was tried as a specimen of a slimy, fish-like surface,
which should partly wash off in the water. The glue was allowed to harden
before being put in the water ; and to test its change of condition consequent
on immersion, three experiments were tried successivelj' at the same velocity.
The resistance was thus found to be throughout on the increase, the first
experiment being about two per cent., and the third about four per cent,
greater than that of the shellac surface, apparently implying that the resis-
tance was increased by the softening of the surface.

    The tinfoU surface is the only surface I have yet tried which I have
found to have a resistance greatly different from that of varnish ; and hei'e it
is remarkable that the difference tends to be much less in the greater lengths
of surface. It is consequently most unfortunate that, owing to the delay I
experienced in getting the tinfoil for the purpose, it became impossible to

try it on a greater length than the IG-foot plane in time for this Eeport.

The comparison of the tinfoil surface with that of the varnish was made on
lengths of 16 feet, 1 foot (5 inches, and 1 foot. The results with the 16-foot
plane tinfoiled are shown by the dotted Hne marked c" in Plate IV. ; those
with the 1-foot and l-foot-6-inch tinfoiled are shown in Plate V. by the
dotted lines marked b' and c" respectively. For comparison with these,
Plate V. also shows the results of the same lengths varnished, by the plain
lines marked b and c respcctivelj'.

    It will be seen by these diagrams that not only is the difference of resistance
between tinfoil and varnish proportionately less in greater lengths of surface,
but is also proportionately less at greater speeds ; consequently the law of the
increase of resistance in terms of velocity is obviously different in the case of
the tinfoil from what it is in the case of the varnish and the otlier surfaces
which were tried.

Report on the Antagonism betioeen the Action of Active Substances.

   By Thomas R. Fraser, M.D., Secretary to the Committee, consisting

   of Sir R. CiiRiSTisoN, Bart., Dr. Laycock^ and Dr. Fraser.

The subject of the antagonism between the actions of active substances

has engaged considerable attention from an early period of medical history.

Many examples of its occurrence have been brought forward, whicli may

be conveniently classified into those that treat of the antagonism of lethal
actions, and those that treat of the antagonism oinon-hthal actions.
ox TIIK ANTAGONISM BETWEEN ACTIVE SUDSTANCES.                                                                                      125

111 llic latter class there are several well-autheuticated examples, among

which may he instanced the antagonism between the actions on the iris

and minute blood-vessels of opium or morphia on the one hand, and bella-

donna, hyoseyamus, and stramonium on the other ; between the actions ou

the capillary circulation of morphia and quinia ; between the actions on

the vagi nerves of physostigma and atropia, hydrocyanic acid and atropia,

and muscaria and ati'opia                                                                                                          and between the actions on the iris and on visual
                                                                                                                                ;

accommodation of physostigma and atropia.

In the /o)-)He;' class the examples are likewise numerous; but a careful

examination of the evidence in their support cannot fail to lead to the con-

clusion that, with very few exceptions, it is of an unsatisfactory nature.

In the majority of cases where an active substance has acquired the

reputation of counteracting the fatal etFect of some other substance or

substances, this reputation has mainly been founded ou the results of

clinical experience. In such experience there are difhcultics in dis-

covering not onlj'^ what dose of poison has been introduced into the sj'stem,
but even when this dose has been ascertained it is generally impossible

to feel assured that it is a sufficient one to produce death ; and, further,

the effects of the substance introduced as a physiological antidote can

rarely be accurately observed. The exigencies of treatment demand that

every likely method of alleviating the symptoms should be applied ; and
among these it is difficult, if not impossible, to discover accurately the

effects of any single antidote. It is not therefore to be wondered at that

the accumulated clinical observations of more than two centuries should

have failed in itroving that opium is able to prevent the fatal effect of

belladonna, and that this evidence has equally failed in establishing the

existence of any one of the examples of lethal antagonism to which atten-

tion has more recently been drawn.

  A method whereby the existence of a lethal antagonism can satisfactorily

be tested is by experiment on the lower animals. In such experiments

the most important of the causes of fallacy that have been alluded to can

readily be avoided. It is a simple matter to determine, in any given species

of animal, the minimum dose of an active substance that can produce

death, and then to test the antidotal influence of its supposed antagonist

when a lethal dose of the poison has been administered. The most con-

vincing proof may be thus obtained of an antidotal influence ; and trusting
to this proof, the practitioner may with confidence employ the antidote in

cases of poisoning in man. It is unnecessary to show that the fallacies

asserted to exist in such experiments have been greatly exaggerated, or

that the supposed differences between the results in man and in the lower

animals do not possess the importance that has been claimed for them, as

fortunately nothing remains to be done in this direction since the con^dncing

arguments of Claude Bernard have been advanced and generally accepted.

In this Iteport it is proposed to bring before the Association the results of

an investigation in which the influence of atropia upon the lethal action of

physostigma was examined, by experiments on the lower animals. The

nature of this influence may be shown by a brief account of two of the ex-

periments that were made.

  A rabbit received by subcutaneous injection a dose of extract of physo-

stigma considerably greater than the minimum lethal ; and one minute and a

half afterwards it received, also by subcutaneous injection, half a grain of

sulphate of atropia. In seven minutes after the injection of atropia the

pupils measured i-| X ^§ of an inch, the size immediately before the ex-
--126 REPORT 1872.

periment having been -^-q- X ify- of an inch ; the rate of the heart's contractions
was considerably accelerated ; fibrillary twitches were occurring, and a little
restlessness was present. Soon afterwards the pupils became still further

dilated, and the animal had some difficulty in moving about. In fifty-two

minutes the pupils measured X-g-^- ^^^ of an inch, and the difficulty in moving
about had become greater. In one hour and ten minutes, however, evidences

of recovery wej'e manifested; the animal went about with but little difficulty,

and frequently a perfectly normal sitting posture was assumed. Indeed the

only symptom of an abnormal character that was now apparent consisted
of frequently occurring and well-marked fibrillary twitches. From this

time the condition of the animal steadily improved, until perfect recovery

occurred. As the minimum lethal dose of this preparation of physostigma,

for any given weight of rabbit, had been determined by a preliminary series
of experiments, it was known that the dose given in this experiment was
rather more than twice as large as the minimum lethal. Yet the fatal eff'ect

of this large dose was prevented in a remarkable manner by the dose of

atropia given in conjunction with it. To add to the proof that was thereby

obtained, of an antagonism between these two substances, there was ad-

ministered to this rabbit, nine days afterwards, a dose of extract of physo-

stigma, only half as large as that from which it had thus recovered. Symptoms

of poisoning very quickly appeared, and death occurred in about fourteen

minutes.

In the second experiment, a dog, Aveighing ten pounds and three ounces, re-

ceived by subcutaneous injection three fifths of a grain of sulphate of ph3'-so-

stigmia, dissolved in a few drops of distilled water. Before the injection the rate

per ten se onds of the cardiac impulses was 32, and that of the respirations 4,
and the size of the pupils was 4-2_ ^ ^a of an inch. In four minutes after the

administration of physostigma slight tremors occui'red, and fibrillary twitches

were present. In five minutes a solution containing three tenths of a grain

of sulphate of atropia was injected under the skin. In two minutes there-
after the tremors had become more prominent and strong, the hmbs were un-

able properly to support the body, saliva escaped from the mouth, and the eye-

balls were unnaturally moist. In five minutes the pupils were greatly

dilated ; but now the secretions of the salivary and lachrymal glands were
diminished. In seven minutes the dog lay quietly on the abdomen and chest,

but in thirteen minutes it fell over on the side. This general condition re-

mained until forty-eight minutes, when the  symptoms  improved                                     and  after
                                                                                                ;

some efforts the dog rose, and then lay down in a normal crouching posture.

Soon afterwards it again got up and walked about the room with only a Httle

unsteadiness. In one hour and fifty-five minutes the animal seemed to be

perfectly well.

   Nineteen days after the performance of this experiment, the same dog
received by subcutaneous injection a dose of suljihate of physostigmia only

one half as large as that from which it had recovered when atropia was

also given, and the result was that death was produced in twcntj'-two minutes.

-It; is manifest that in these two experiments atropia acted as a physio-

logical counteragent to the toxic action of physostigma. In other 195 ex-

periments the fatal cifect of undoubtedly lethal doses of physostigma was

likewise -prevented by atropia.- This investigation has therefore proved that

atropiar is a eounterageut to the lethal action of physostigma.

   As both of these substances possess a number of separate actions, it was not

unreasonable to anticipate that several of them are not mutually antagonistic,

and therefore that combinations of certain doses of the tM'o substances mav

he administered whereby the uon-antagouized actions will be produced in
Bufflcient degrees of energy to be able to cause death. It was probable,
therefore, that successful antagonism would not be exerted throughout an un-
limited range of doses, but only within a definite range.

    In order to define the limits of the counteracting influence of atropia upon
the lethal action of physostigma, three series of experiments were made.

    It was found necessary to make all the experiments of these three series
on rabbits, as it was impossible to obtain a sufficient number of any other
suitable animal. The rabbits used were generally about three pounds in
weight ; but when they were lighter or heavier than three pounds a correction
was made, so that each dose represented three pounds weight of animal.

    In the first and second series a constant interval of time was maintained
between the administration of the two substances ; but in the first atropia
was administered five minutes before physostigma, while in the second atropia
was administered five minutes after physostigma. In both of these series

experiments were made, in the first place, with the minimum lethal dose of

physostigma, and in combination with it various doses of atropia were given,
ranging from one that was too small to prevent death, through a number that
were able to do so, until a dose was found whose administration resulted in
death. Similar experiments were made with a dose of physostigma once and

a half as large as the minimum lethal ; then with one twice as large as the
minimum lethal, and so on, at the same rate of progression, until a dose was
reached that was too large to be successfully counteracted by any dose of

atropia.

   The results obtained by the first of these two series of experiments were,
that with the minimum lethal dose of physostigma 0-005 gr. of sulphate of
atropia is too small a dose to prevent death, but that 0015 gr. is sufficient
to do so; and that with any dose ranging from 0-015 gr. to 5-2 grs., the
fatal effect of this dose of physostigma may be prevented ; while if the dose

of sulphate of atropia be 5-3 grs. or more, the region of successful antagonism

is left, and death occurs. With once and a half the minimum lethal dose

of physostigma, successful antagonism was produced by doses of sulphate

of atropia ranging from 0-02 to 4-1 grs. ; with twice the minimum lethal

dose of physostigma, with doses of sulphate of atropia ranging from 0-021 to

3-2 grs. ; with two and a half times the minimum lethal dose of physostigma,

with doses of sulphate of atropia ranging from 0-025 to 2-2 grs. ; with thrice

the minimum lethal dose of physostigma, with doses of sulphate of atropia
ranging from 0-06 to 1-2 gr. ; and with three and a Jialf times the minimum

lethal dose of physostigma, with doses of sulphate of atropia ranging from
0-1 to 2 gr. Successful antagonism could not be obtained above this dose,

and accordingly three and a half times the minimum lethal dose of physo-

stigma is the largest quantity wtose lethal action can be prevented by

atropia administered five minutes previously.

   The results obtained by the second series of experiments (in which atropia
was administered five minutes after physostigma) were essentially the same as
those obtfined by the first series, excepting that the region of successful
antagonism was found to be a more limited one. In both series the general
result was obtained, that the range of doses of atropia capable of preventing
the lethal action of physostigma diminishes according as the dose of physo-

stigma is increased.

    In the third series of experiments, a constant dose of physostigma (once

and a half the minimum lethal) was given along with various doses of

atropia ; and with each of the doses of atropia several experiments were
123 EEPORT--1872.                                                              \

made, which differed from each other by a difference in the interval of time

between the administration of the two substances. On this plan two sets of

.experiments were made, in one of which atropia was given before physo-
stigma, and in the other after it ; and subsequently these two sets of ex-
periments were connected together by a third, in which atropia, in various
doses, was given simultaneoushj with the same dose of physostigma as was
given in the two other sets of experiments. The general result of this series
of experiments is that successful antagonism occurs with a greater range of
doses of atropia, and a greater range of intervals of time between the two
administrations, when atropia is given before physostigma than when it is

given after it.

   An eminent authoritj' in pharmacology has recently published the state-

ment that the onlj' method whereby the injuiious action of a poison, absorbed
into the blood, can be made to terminate is by the employment of such
means as will cause or hasten the elimination of the poison. This statement,
fortunately, does not accurately describe our remedial resources. The exist-
ence of so undoubted an example of i)hysiological antagonism as that between
atropia and physostigma shows that the toxic influence of a morbific agent

may be directly opposed bj^ a physiological antidote, and that recovery may

be produced by influencing the abnormal conditions themselveSj in such a
manner as to cause their return to a normal state.

   purpose of invesiirjating the Rate of Increase of Underground Tem-

  perature downwards in various localities of Dry Land and under
   Water. By Professor Everett, D.C.L., Secretary.

In December last intelligence was received from Prof. Sismonda that the
administration of the railway owning the Alpine tunnel had given per-
mission to Father Secchi to carry on a series of observations in the tunnel
concerning terrestrial magnetism, and that this distinguished observer was
willing at the same time to conduct observations of temperature in accord-

ance with the plans of your Committee. Two maximum and two minimum

thermometers were accordingly placed in Father Secchi's hands ; but it
appears that the arrangements for commencing the magnetic observations
are not yet completed, and that accordingly no observations of tempera-
ture have as yet been taken.

    Prof. Lubimoff, of Moscow, on receiving a copy of last year's Report,
wrote to the Secretary, correcting a mistake in the description of the
thermometer used in taking observations in the Moscow well. The ther-
mometer was enclosed in an hermetically sealed case containing air, and
was therefore completely protected against any possible effect of pressure.
Prof. Lubimoff at the same time asked to be furnished with a thermometer
ON UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE.  129

of the new pattern iloscribed in the Report (the upright I^egrctti pattern),
und one of these instruments was accordingly sent.

    Dr. Wild, of the Central Observatory, St. Petersburg, wrote in January,
requesting that two thermometers for observations in bores might be ordered

in his name. At this time the Secretary was in correspondence with Sir

Wm. Thomson, who entertained doubts as to the successful working of the

new thermometer, and expressed a preference for the Phillips pattern

(which has been described in preceding Eeports) and the Casella-Miller

pattern (a modified Six), which has been extensively used for deep-sea
temperatures. Thermometers of these two patterns were accordingly ordered
and despatched to Dr. Wild.

  A letter was received from Prof. Henry, of the Smithsonian Institution,

Washington, in April, stating that the Chief Engineer of the Hoosac Tunnel
had promised to have observations of temperature taken in the tunnel, if

thermometers were sent. Its total length will be 4| miles, about two
thirds of which has been penetrated, by working from both ends and from
a central shaft 1028 feet deep. The mountain has two ridges, under
which the tunnel passes, and their heights above it are respectively 1720
and 1420 feet. Four thermometers have been sent, viz. two large mini-

mum Rutherfords, for observations in the tunnel, and two upright Negrettis,

for observations in the shaft.

   The Council of the School of Mines at Ballar-at, Australia, have, in com-
pliance with a request addressed to one of their number by our observer,
Mr. David Burns, C.E., consented to take charge of some thermometers, and to
furnish observations from the bores and shafts iu that important gold-mining
district. Most of the principal mining manager's are connected with the
school. Four thermometers have accordingly been sent, viz. two upright
Ifegrettis for observptions in bores, and two simple mercurial thermometers,

of large size, for obLcrvations during the sinking of shafts.

   Some exceedingly deep Artesian borings have been undertaken in Franco
in recent years ; and the President of the Geological Society, Mr. Prest-
"wich (who has allowed his name to be added to your Committee), has fur-
nished your Secretary with introductions which wiU probably lead to the
obtaining of very numerous and valuable observations from these wells.

   The largest of them all is one which is now sinking for the municipality
of Paris, at La Cbapelle, St. Denis, a northern suburb of Paris, and has

ali-eady obtained a depth considerably exceeding that of the Puits de Gre-
neUe. It is expected that its final depth will be about 2300 feet. Appli-

cation was made by the Secretary to the eminent firm of well-borers, Messrs.
Mauget, Lippmann, anu Co., who are sinking the well, and these gentlemen
at once, in the most obliging manner, consented to take observations of tem-

perature in i*-. An upri jht Negretti thermometer was accordingly furnished
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

and about the 20th of June your Secietary had the pleasure of receiving from
them two complete sets of observations taken on the 14th, 15th, 17th, and

18th of that month with their own hands, at every 100th metre of depth,
and also at the bottom of the well, 660 metres deep.

   The observations are given in the subjoined Table, iu which the third
column shows the time that the thei'mometer was allowed to remain at the
depth specified before hauling up and reading. The temperature at which
the thermometer was set before letting jt down is also given in Messrs.
Mauget and Lippmanu's report, but is not here inserted.

The springs which -wore met with in the tertiary strata correspond to

those found in other parts of the basin in which Paris is situated, and

have not sufficient strength to spout above the surface of the ground at

this elevation. They were encountered at the depths of 19"2 metres,
34-5 metres, 86 metres, and 97 metres, and the water now stands in

equilibrium in the central tube at 16-5 metres below the surface of the

ground.

It was not practicable to take observations of temperature during the

regular progress of the boring ; but an interruption occurred on the 12th

of June, and the tool was not at work from this date till after both sets

of observations were finished. In reference to this point, Messrs. Mauget

and Lippmanu say, under date April 29, " To obtain the natural temperature,
it will be necessarj' to select a time when the work has been interrupted for

several days ; for the boring being executed by the full of a heavy tool upon
the bottom of the well, the percussion developes a considerable amount of

heat, as we perceive by the mud (Jes boues) which we extract, and which

in coming to the surface is found to have still a temperature of from 48°

to 90° C. (118° to 194° F.)."  In their letter of June 19, containing the

report of the observations, they remark :

" You will observe that though the water at the bottom of the well is

still some degrees above its natural temperature owing to the action of

the drill {trepan), the latter has not been in operation since the 12th of

the month. At a convenient time, we intend to observe the temperature
of the mud as it lies at the bottom of the well, immediately after the

withdrawal of the drill, wfien the latter has been working constantly, a

temperature which will probably be found to depend upon the hardness of

the rock."

The following Table exhibits the successive increments of temperature

shown in the second series, which purports to be the more accurate :

         Depth, in metres.
--133 KEPORT 1872.

temperature could have remained for two daj'S without sensible diminution.
In connexion -with this question, the apparent cooling to the extent of
0°*4 at the depth of 6U0 metres between the first and second observation
demands attention, and is not very easily explained.

    If the observed temperature at 660 metres is to be talien as the normal
temperature, the average increase from 100 metres to that depth is at the
rate of 1° F. in 22-2 metres, or in 72-8 feet. If the observed tempera-
ture at 600 metres in the second scries is adopted, the increase from
100 metres to that depth is at the rate of 1° F. in 28-7 metres, or in

9-1-3 feet.

   The observations proposed by Messrs. Mauget and Lippmann in the para-
graph above quoted Avill be eminently calculated to assist in showing the

correct interpretation.

    Mr. G. A. Lebour, F.G.S., of II.M. Geological Survey, has furnished obser-
vations taken in a bore-hole executed at the bottom of South Iletton Colliery,
Durham. The observations were taken by Mr. J. E. Atkinson, a student at
the Newcastle College of Physical Science, and appear to have been carefully
made. Thanks are also due to the viewer of the colliery, Mr. Matthews, for
granting the requisite facilities.

   The hole is 2^ inches in diameter, and was bored out of the pumping
side of the South Hettou shaft, in order that the bore-rods might be the more
readily altered. The depth of the shaft is 1066 feet, that of the bore-hole
863 feet from the bottom of the shaft, or 1929 feet from the surface of
the ground. The section of the boring (not including the shaft) consists
of 123 alternating beds of shale and sandstone*, with occasional thin seams
of coal and some fire-clays. The bottom of the boring has reached a very
coarse white grit, which is supposed to be the topmost bed of the Millstone-

grit series.

    The bore was dry at the time of its execution, but has since become
filled with water, probably derived from the shaft above it. Streams, in
fact, pour down the shaft and play about the hole.

   Two thennometers, one of them an unprotected Phillips, and the other a
protected Negretti, were supplied by the Secretary to Mr. Lebour, as it was
not certainly known at that time whether the bore was dry or wet. Mr.

Lebour indeed believed it to be dry, but nevertheless selected the Negretti
thermometer, as it was thought that the Phillips could not be read off accu-
rately with the poor light which in the position of this bore-hole was alone

available.

    The following Table exhibits the results of all the observations which
have been taken in the bore, including three which were taken in 1869,
while the boring Avas going on. The boring was stopped, in the case of each
of these three observations, only about 20 minutes before the observations
were made ; and the heat due to friction appears to have produced abnormal
elevation of temperature, amounting to about 2° at the depth of 288 feet, to
about 6° at the depth of 582 feet, and to considerably more than this at
858 feet. The other observations in the Table are Mr. Atkinson's, taken

with the Negretti thermometer.

   A* complete list of the strata Las been furnished, and will be preserved by the Secre-

tary, with a view to future reference if required.

--134 REPORT 1873.

It is called Brandon "Walls shaft, and belongs to the Eookhope Valley Mining

Company, to the courtesy of whose agent we are indebted for liberty to take

observations. This shaft is some G miles cast of those reported on last

year, and is situated in the very bottom- of llookhope Yalloy. - The mouth

is covered over with a wooden shed, the shaft itself is free from all obstruc-

tion, and the water in it has not been disturbed for some years. The shaft

is 333 feet deep, and is full of water to within 25 feet of the surface of the

ground. Observations (by ]Mr. Burns and Mr. Curry, of Bolkburn) were

taken in it on five diftererit days in July of the present year but though
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

agreeing well with one another from day to day, they are so irregular that

they throw little light on the rate of increase of underground temperature.

At the depths of 83 and 133 feet from the ground the temperature was

4S°-5. In the next 50 feet there was an increase of about 3°, the tempera-

ture at 183 feet being about 51°-4, and from this depth to the bottom (an

interval of 150 feet) the temperature was nearly constant. The best deter-

mination of the temperature at the bottom was 51°- 7.

   It may be remarked that all observations in shafts thus far have exliibitcd

irregularities of this kind. The water in such large openings seems to have

its temperature governed by springs and other extraneous causes, rather than

by the temperature of the surrounding soil.

The observations at every 50th foot of depth in the Kentish Town well, as

given in previous Reports, are so complete that it has not been thought

Anecessary to continue them.  very delicate thermometer, reading by esti-

mation to the -j-Lj- of a degree, has, however, been procured, for taking obser-

vations from year to year at one constant depth (1000 feet). It was con-

structed ten months ago, and being enclosed in a partially exhausted glass

tube, wiU probably not undergo much change of zero. It has been four times

tested by comparison Avith standards, and has been foiind to have no error

amounting to nearly so much as 0°*1. In consequence of Mr. Symons's

illness, no observation has yet been taken with it in the well.

  A Six's thermometer, which, through tlie breaking of a rope, had fallen

into the mud at the depth of 1090 feet from the surface of the ground, was

extracted by Mr. Symous last November, more than a year after its fall. It

had sustained no damage, and its indication when hauled up was 69°-4,

nearly agreeing with the temperature previously observed at that depth.

In addition to the large number of thermometers above mentioned as

having been issued during the past year, one has been furnished for obser-

vations which are to be made in the projected boring through the Wealden

and underlying strata. With the exception of Mr. Symons's observations at
Kentish Town (London, N.), we have as yet no observations of temperature

from the southern parts of England,

   LL.D., F.R.S.

The experiments of the Committee have hitherto been confined to testing the

electrical permanence of the coil of wire used in the pyrometer. For this

purpose the resistance of the coil has been repeatedly taken at known

temperatures, and also at a red heat, at which latter temperature the resist-
ance Avas about three and a half times as great as at atmospheric tem-
peratures. After being heated, it was found that the resistance of the
pyrometer was slightly greater at a low temperature than it liad been at the
same temperature previously ; but the permanent change which thus took
place became smaller and smaller after successive heatings, so that the

instrument may be expected to reach a condition in which no further im-

portant alteration will be produced in it by exposure to a red heat.
   The Committee are, however, informed by Mr. Siemens that he believes

that the small amount of variation to which the pyrometer, as hitherto con-

structed, was thus found to be subject, may be considerably lessened, or

altogether prevented, by an easy alteration in the mode of enclosing the coil.
Under these circumstances it is considered desirable to postpone further trials
until the more perfect form of the instrument can be experimented with ; the
Committee, therefore, suggest that they should be reappointed, and that the

...grant of =£30, made at the last Meeting, none of which has been expended,

should be renewed.

The Committee, since its reappointment at the last Meeting of the Associa-

tion at Edinburgh, has pursued the inquiry intrusted to it, and, as heretofore,

its investigations have been limited to such matters as have afforded the

promise of practical utility. Among the various methods of treatment or

utilization of sewage brought to the notice of the Committee, that of treating

sewage by Messrs. Weare's process at Stoke Union AVorkhouse, the precipi-

tation and conversion of the deposited matters into cement at Ealing, and

the system of intermittent downward filtration at Merthyr Tydfil have

appeared most important ; and they have accordingly been investigated, the

as Whitthread's patent has been also examined by experiment on a suffi-

The Committee having reported upon the sewage-farms at Tunbridge WelU

and Earlswood at the last Meeting of the Association, it was thought

advisable to iuspect them again, as the works were incomplete when the

Committee last visited them.

The observations at Breton's Parm have been proceeded with uninter-

ruptedly, and are described in Section VII. of this Report. It is only neces-

sary to add here that these investigations have now extended over a period

of more than two years ; and the experience thus gained from the continuous

application upon the produce grown, and the degree of purification effected
 n the sewage, will, it is hoped, prove valuable to sewer authorities and
 others interested in the question of sewage-farming. Being fullj' impressed
 with the importance of these investigations, the Committee has paid special
 attention to render them as complete as possible ; but it is felt that to perfect
 them, especially as regards the important branch relating to the effect of
the application of the sewage upon the crops grown, it will be necessary to
continue them for, at least, some months longer. This cannot, however, be
done unless further funds are placed at the disposal of the Committee. The
large number of analyses already made for the Committee, together with the
great expense of an assistant constantly at Breton's Farm, and the various

other investigations undertaken, have now nearly exhausted the Special
Tund contributed by the towns. In requesting its reappointment, the Com-

mittee begs to submit to the Council of the Association the desirability of placing
it in a position to complete the long and anxious inquiry intrusted to it.

Section I. DeoJorlzafion of Sewage and preapkatlon of Solid Matters, as
    carried on loider the Patent of Messrs. Weare and Co. at Stol-e Union

      Worhho^tse.

    The attention of the Committee was specially directed to this process by the
authorities of towns where the process had been discussed as a possible
means of dealing satisfactorily with sewage ; and although only in operation
on a small scale, the Committee felt it desirable to investigate the results, such
as they were, and accordingly an inspector was sent in September 1871 to
the Workhouse at Stoke-upon-Trent. Every facility was afforded by the
manager for the examination of the process, which was fairly conducted, and
the Governor of the Union kindjy gave the requisite particulars of the

administration of the establishment.

   The workhouse contains on an average 750 persons of all ages, whose
diet comprises meat and vegetables, puddings, rice, and soup, each on certain
days of the week. The supply of water tit for drinking and culinary pur-
poses is very small, and is obtained principally from a well pumped by a
steam-engine, and that for washing and scouring is taken from a pond,
which is chiefly supplied by rain-water from roofs. Every department of the
establishment is provided with water-closets, on the trough system, and they
are emptied every 24 hours, and closely attended to in order to prevent
interference by the inmates.

   The process of purification of the sewage is protected by a patent. It con-
sists, in the first instance, of simple filtration through coarse ashes and char-
coal, performed in a large tank called the Foecal Tank, which is divided into

two compartments, so that one may be at work while the other is being

cleared. These compartments are again subdivided into two chambers, one
large and one small. The raw sewage is brought to a small receiver and
from it turned, by means of sluices, into either compartment. The samples
of sewage taken by the Committee's inspector were obtained fi'om this
receiver ; the flow was ascertained to be about .5000 gallons in the 24

hours, being much below the capacity of the filters, which were constructed
for 20,000 gallons per day. Erom the large chambers of the faecal tank the
sewage is passed through wooden screens, containing 2 feet of charcoal, into

the small chambers, which contain about 5 feet 6 inches of rough charcoal,
through which the sewage passes to a smaller tank or well, thus completing
the first stage of filtration. The suspended matters are partly arrested by

tlic wooden and charcoal screens between tlie large and amall chambers, and
a further deposit takes place in the small chamber, which is cleared once iu
six months ; but at the time of the Committee's inspection it had not been
cleared for nine months, owing to the constant visits of persons anxious to
inspect the process. Samples of the sewage at this stage of the process were

duly taken. From the tank or well before described, the sewage (after again

passing through a perforated screen containing 6 inches of rough charcoal)

is conveyed by a 12-inch pipe to the "Deodorizers," Avhich are, in tliis case,

at some distance from the fiecal tank.

  --The " Deodorizers " are three in number, the first and largest having a

surface area of nearly 200 square feet, and containing 5 feet G inches depth
of rough charcoal ; the second, with an area of about 70 square feet, contains
2 feet 6 inches of charcoal of smaller size ; the last is a small box containing
4 feet of fine charcoal, Avhich is in this instance supplemented by layers of
flannel and filter-cloth. It was stated, however, that cloth is not a neces-
sary addition if the tanks are specially constructed, in which case the last
deodorizer is arranged for upward filtration. This completes the process, the
effluent water being discharged into a small well, from which the samples

were taken for analysis.
   Tlie charcoal used at the time of the Committee's inspection was wood-

charcoal but it was stated that it was proposed to use peat-charcoal. The
                                                   ;

practice is to remove the "spent" charcoal from the last deodorizer to the
second one, from the second to the first, and from the first deodorizer to the
ftecal tank. Samples were taken of charcoal from each deodorizer after various
periods of service, and analyses of them and of unused charcoal are appended.

   The flow of eflluent water for the period of twenty-four hours, during
which continuous gaugings were taken, amounted to about 2000 gallons
only, as against 5000 gallons of sewage received into the fiecal tank during
the same period. The deposit removed from the tanks with tlie refuse of
the establishment is utilized upon the farm belonging to the Union, -which is

cultivated entirely by the inmates.

sewage, eflluent water, and charcoal :

operations, and especially as to the constniction, size, and action of the
tanks. They had analyses made of the sewage and effluent water, and com-
pared the quantity of the sewage with the capacity of the filtering media,
and in all respects fully investigated the matter ; and they came to the con-
clusion, which the analj'ses proved, that the process did not fulfil the condi-
tions of purifying sewage, so as to render it fit to bo discharged into running
streams. They particularly remarked upon the amount of filtering media
not being of sufficient bulk for the purpose.

the absence of any better mode of getting rid of it, and in consequence of the

loss whicli results from attempting to deal with it as a manure, it has even

been proposed to destroy it by burning.

The Committee inspected the works at Ealing in September 1871. On

that occasion it was found that General Scott's process was not in operation,

although he was treating the sewage experimentally with deodorizers. It

was decided therefore to test the existing system of treating sewage by up-

ward filtration ; and for this purpose it was arranged that General Scott

should not apply deodorizers to the sewage during the sampling &c. by

the Committee. It appeared, however, that the Local Board kept a man at

the upper end of the town mixing deodorizers with the sewage every day

(except Sunday). The deodorizing-mixture was being added to the sewage

at the rate of 20 gallons an hour, but its composition was not stated.

--Samples were taken on behalf of the Committee : 1st, of the sewage as it

entered the works ;  2nd, of  the sewage after leaving the precipitating-tank
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

3rd, after passing through tlie first filter ; 4th, after passing through the

second filter. The samples were taken six times during the day, the quan-

tity taken being proportioned to the flow at the time. It was further deemed

advisable to ascertain the effect of the deodorizing-mixture added by the

Local Board; and for this purpose arrangements were made that nothing

should be added on a certain day, when samples of the sewage and of the

effluent water at the outfall were obtained. The analyses of the six samples

will be found below; and it will be seen that the results confirm the investi-

gations of the Eivers Pollution Commissioners, and that the process does not

render the sewage fit to be discharged into running streams.

The next investigation by the Committee took place in March 1872, when

the sewage works were wholly under General Scott's control. On this occa-

sion gaugings were taken which confirmed the previous statements of the

daily discharge of sewage being about 400,000 gallons. The samples were

taken every two hours, in the proportion of jyVu ^^ ^^^ ^^^^ ^^ ^°'"'* '-^'^^
gaugings and samplings extended over five days, and the analyses made for

the Committee by Dr. llussell are given below.

  A further inspection of the Avorks was made last month (July) during

very hot weather, when it was found that the process was proceeding with-

out any nuisance whatever, although the depositing-tanks are clearly not of

sufficient capacity, a defect which it is intended to remedy. The effluent

water, after leaving the depositing-tanks, contains some suspended matter,

and has a scum on its surface which can only be got rid of by filtration. It

is proposed to filter it with this view; but the liquid will still contain the

soluble organic impurities (see remarks on analyses), which can only be re-

duced in quantity by filtration through soil by means of irrigation, for which

the effluent water of Ealing is well adapted.

The open ditch, before referred to, which conveys the deodorized sewage

from tbe outfall to the Thames, was carefully examined on this occasion, but
not the slightest smeU was detected ; the water has, however, a yellow tinge,
from a slight precipitate which it deposits along the line of the ditch. This

15 no doubt due to the insufficient capacity of the depositing-tanks, the

increase of which will probably effect an improvement.

One of the difficulties attending the process as now conducted, is the dry-

ing of the precipitated sludge with sufficient rapidity. If this is done by

heat, it is liable to cause a nuisance, being by far too slow in action even at
Eahng, with only about 2 tons of sludge daily. It is proposed in this case to

force the water out of the sludge by means of Needham and Kite's hydraulic

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I

   On the whole this process, when perfected, promises well as a means of

--treating one of the difficulties of the sewage question the dispofral of the

the solid matters by fire, but also to secure some return from their use in

the manufacture of cement.

mixture, effected only a very slight purification of the sewage, which left in the
filters stiU a sewage of average strength ; it was not even clarified. AVith
regard to General Scott's i^rocess, it would appear that by it the suspended
matters are precipitated very completely : as to tlie more important consti-
tuents of the sewage, it is seen from the analyses that the effluent water
contained rather more than two thirds of the chlorine, and three fourths of
the dissolved nitrogen of the sewage ; but it must be remarked that the

dissolved nitrogen appears in a different way in the effluent water and in
the sewage ; the actual ammonia is reduced to one quarter of its amount,

while the organic nitrogen, doubtless from solution of some of the nitrogenous
suspended matters, is nearly doubled in amount in the effluent water. Some
oxidation, too, has taken place by which nitrates appear in the solution. Such

water would be much too impure to be sent into a river, and too valuable to

bo wasted ; indeed it is not pretended that the process is capable oi purifijinjj
the liquid sewage, its object is merely the separation and deodorization of
the sludge (which, in the majority of cases, must necessarily be removed before
the sewage can be utilized), and its ultimate use as fuel in the manufacture
of cement.

                                                       Sectiox III.

   A process known as " Whitthread's Patent " having been brought under

the notice of the Committee, has been investigated by a preliminary experi-
ment on a sufflcicntly large scale, although it is not at present in operation
anywhere, the supporters agreeing to pay the expense of the necessary

analyses.

   The process consists in the addition of a mixture of dicalcic and mono-
calcic phosphate containing, it was stated, two equivalents of dicalcic to one of
monocalcic phosphate (the latter being added as commercial superphosphate),
and then afterwards a little milk of lime. In the experiment referred to 100
gallons of sewage, taken from the Eomford sewer before it joins the tanks
on Ereton's Farm, were operated on, one pound of the mixture being stirred
up in a little water, and added after the addition of a little milk of lime.
The precipitation was very rapid, and the supernatant water remained very
nearly clear and quite inoffensive.

    The accompanying Table shows the result of the analyses of the raw
sewage, the supernatant water, and the precipitate :

  We have said that the suspended matters Avere in very small amount in

the supernatant A\-ater ; this is evidently merely a question of time allowed for

settling. It will be seen that the amount of ammonia in solution is some-
what greater in the cfflneiit water than in the sewage, doubtless from the
decomposition of some of the soluble organic matter in solution ; but the
most remarkable thing is that the organic matter in solution was almost
entirely removed in this experiment, so that while the sewage contained 0-90
part of organic nitrogen in solution in 100,000 parts, the supernatant water

only contained 0-02 part. It must, however, be distinctly understood that;

this is only a preliminary experiment, from which general conclusions must
not be too hastily drawn. The supernatant water contained a considerable

quantity of phosphoric acid, viz. 5-53 parts in 100,000.

   The analysis of the precipitate shows it to contain a largo proportion of
phosphate of lime ; and its value is much enhanced by the three per cent, of

ammonia which it also contains.
    The ijresence of phosphoric acid in the supernatant water would be of con-

siderable advantage if this were afterwards used for irrigation, but, unless
means are devised for separating it, would constitute a serious loss if the

water were thrown away.

   On the whole, then, this preliminary experiment shows that the process in

question well deserves further and careful investigation.

Sectiok IV. Additional Note on tJie Dry Earth system.

   In the last Eeport'the Committee gave the results which Dr. Gilbert had
obtained from the analysis of soil which had been used in an earth-closet

either once or twice.

It appeared that, " calculated upon the air-dried condition, the increase in

the percentage  of nitrogen was  only about  0-15  each time the  soil  was  used
                                                                                                   ;

and, even after using twice, the soil was not richer than good garden-mould."

Prom two agreeing determinations Dr. Gilbert now finds that soil which

has been used three times in the closet contains, when dried at 100° C, only

0-446 per cent, of nitrogen; and dupHcate determinations entirely confirmed

this result, so that we have the following series :

                                       (I. E.VELSAVOOD SkAVAGE-FaEM.

   It will be remembered that the Committee investigated the utilization of
the selvage of Rcdhill, Surrey, at Earlswood Common, and reported the result
at the last Meeting of the British Association at Edinburgh. In this Eeport
the extent and mode of laying out the land and applying the sewage were
described, and analyses were given of samples of the sewage and eflBuent
water taken by the Committee. The results of these analyses showed that
the sewage, although very weak, was but very imperfectly purified by the
process ; and that this was so, was attributed by the Committee chiefly to
the absence of underdrainage in the irrigated land, the analyses and various

observations as to the temperatures of the samples pointing to the conclusion
that the land had become saturated, and that the sewage simply flowed over
it instead of percolating through it.

   The Committee has again examined this farm, considering it desirable to

ascertain and report any change of circumstances connected with it. No

sampling of the sewage or effluent water was made on this occasion, as it
was found that the farm remained very much in the same condition as when

last visited.

   The outfall ditch, which receives the effluent sewage from the lowest beds,
has been lowered 2 feet, so as to admit of subsoil-drainage over the whole
farm ; but none has been executed, although the idea was at one time enter-

tained.

   The sewage is still passed through " Latham's patent extractor ;" but the
result is only to disengage a veiy small amount of solid matter, and it re-

quires the attendance of one man daily.

   The land has been taken as a sewage-farm for the sewage of lleigate as
well as that of Redhill ; but the sewage from the former place is not j'ct
conveyed to the farm, the sewer, which was in course of construction last

year, being still incomplete.

   The flow of sewage and effluent water was found to be aboiit equal in
quantity, viz. 250 gallons per minute. Looking at the results of the pre-
sent system, with the sewage of lledhill only, the effect of adding that from
lleigate cannot be expected to be satisfactory, unless improvements arc made
in the mode of laying out the land, and unless it is properly underdrained.

   The croi)s on the farm consist principally of rye-grass and oats, with a
few mangolds. The rye-grass, of which three crops have been cut this year,
is for the most part made into hay, there not being sufficient demand for it in

the green state. It should be stated that on the occasion of this inspection

the efiiuent water was running apparently clear and free from smeU.

   The Committee also deemed it desirable to inquire what had been done at

these farms since the investigation last year.
    It will be remembered that the sewage of Tunbridge Wells, which is tole-

rably concentrated, is conveyed by gravitation to two farms, one situated on
the north, and the other on the south of the town. The farms were not
unifoi-miy underdrained, but some previously existing drainage was employed
under a peculiar system to redistribute the eflluent sewage -water. The dis-
tribution was effected by the catchwater system, the sewage-sludge being

previously allowed, to subside in tanks constructed for the purpose.

   Analyses of the samples taken on the first inspection of the Coramittco
sliowed that the purification effected Mas, on the whole, unsatisfactory, espe-

cially on the south farm.
   ]S"o samples were taken at the recent inspection of the farms, it being

desired principally to ascertain their present working condition. On visit-

ing the north farm it was found that the sewage was running into the tanks

at the rate of 280 gallons per minute. It was muddy, and smelt very
strongly. The cfllueut water appeared to be running clear and free from
smell, and the stream into which it is discharged was clearer than it was at
the last inspection. Some additional catchwater-drains had been put in,
and some defective subsoil-drains repaired ; but, as far as could be learned, no
regular system of subsoil-drainage had been commenced. The crops on this
farm consisted of meadow-grass, Italian rj^e-grass, mangolds, oats, beans, and

wheat, and were generally in excellent condition ; but the rye-grass is not so

strong as it was last year, probably owing to this being the third year after

sowing.  There is  plenty of  demand for it  at  Is.  per  rod  green                            and  about
                                                                                              ;

1 000 cubic yards of hay, of very good quality, had been made from it this year.

The other crops are described as very heavy. It was stated that a large field

of turnips, being infested with the fly, was flooded with sewage, which drowned

the fly and saved the crop, which is expected to turn out well, but rather

late. The wheat was sewaged twice during the spring, and was a very fine

crop, the Committee's Inspector computing the probable average yield at

about seven quarters per acre. The whole farm was described as looking

better and in a healthier state than last year.

   On the south farm the sewage was running into the tanks at the rate of
440 gallons per minute, and it smelt very ofi'ensively. The efilueut water
was very clear and free from smell. The crops on this farm were also look-
ing very well, but not generally so fine as those on the north farm. The

ryegrass here, as at the other farm, was not so strong as last year, from
which it would appear that three years is too long to grow and cut from the
same roots. There were about ten acres of wheat, four being on sewaged

ground, and six manured with the sediment from the tanks, both looking
equally well. Some hops which received sewage in the winter compared

very favourably with others which are too high above the carriers to be
Asewaged, being stronger in the bine and of a darker green colour.
                                                                                                      field

of beans was noticed, one portion of the crop being very heavy and healthy-

looking, and the other very poor and stunted. On inquiry it was ascertained

that the whole field had been equally sewaged, but that the portion where

the crop was so good had been drained 4 feet deep during last winter, the

other portion being left undrained. It seems desirable to call attention to

this circumstance, as aff'ording further proof of the necessity (already insisted

upon by the Committee in a previous Ileport) of subsoil-drainage in con-
nexion with sewage irrigation. It was stated that there was a ready sale for
the green crops produced on this farm. The rye-grass is appreciated by the

locai cow-feeders, who say that their cattle thrive well on it. Judging from

the experience of these farms, it would also appear that sewage irrigation is,

when  properly managed,  as well adapted for grain crops as for  green crops
                                                                                                               ;

but the quantity which can be applied to them being comparatively very

small, the area for the distribution and application of the sewage must be

greatly increased in proportion as corn crops are grown by its aid.

      --Section YI. Merthi/r Tycljil Scwar/e-Farm at Troechjrhlw.

   In January last the attention of the Committee was directed to a system
of purifying sewage by intermittent downward filtration which was then
completed at Troedyrhiw, near Merthyr Tydfil, for dealing with the sewage

of the latter place.

   In 1870 the present Eivers Pollution Commissioners, in their first Eeport,
described some most important experiments which had been conducted in
their laboratory by Dr. Edward Fraukland, F.R.S., which satisfactorily proved
that intermittent downward filtration (which is, in fact, irrigation confined to
a small area), " properly conducted, is a most efficient means of piuifying
sewage." The various trials with different soils showed conclusively that
town sewage might in this manner be cleansed and rendered sufficiently
innocuous for discharge into streams. The Commissioners stated that an
acre of filtering material G feet deep would so cleanse the sewage of 3300
jicople ; but they expressed an opinion that, whilst successful from a remedial
point of view, the system would be very wasteful, as not utilizing the valuable
manurial properties of sewage : and for this reason it was only to be recom-
mended for employment on a small scale, or where circumstances rendered
other processes difficult and expensive.

   In 1868, and again in 1869, injunctions were granted by the Court of
Chancery to prevent the Local Board of Merthyr Tydfil from discharging the
sewage of that town into the river Taff.

   Merthyr Tydfil contains a population of 50,000; but, according to informa-
tion supplied to the Committee, the excretal refuse of not more than two fifths
of this number is discharged into the sewers, although the slops and other
liquid refuse from a further like number (20,000) is stated to be admitted.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the sewage is, as afterwards appears,,
exceedingly weak.

   In 1870 the Local Board gave notice for the purchase of 393 acres of land
in the valley of the Taff, upon which to dispose of the sewage. Of this
quantity 70 to 80 acres were purchased below the village of Troedyrhiw,
which is about three miles from Merthyr Tydfil ; and it is here that an area
of about 20 acres has, under the supervision of a member of the Committee,
been converted into a filter-bed for the practice of the system of downward fil-
tration originated by the Rivers Pollution Commissioners, as above described.

   The soil of this area consists of a deep bed of gravel (probably the former
bed of the river TafP, which is embanked upon the east side, and is raised
above the valley), composed of rounded pebbles of the Old Ilcd Sandstone and
Coal-measure formations, interspersed with some loam and beds of sand,
forming an extremely porous deposit, and having a vegetable mould on the

surface.

   The land has been pipe-drained at a depth of less than 7 feet, and the
pipes are concentrated at the lowest corner, where the effluent water is dis-
eiiarged into an open drain, which leads to the river Taff at some distance
down the valley.

   The area is laid out in square beds, intersected with roads and paths, along
which are constructed the main carriers which receive the sewage from the
outfall sewer and distribute it over the beds.

   The sewage before entering the farm is screened through a bed of " slag,"
which arrests the coarser matters. It is applied to the land intermittently

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

for the area being divided into four plots or beds, it is turned on each one

aeration of the soil.                                                 .

The surface of the land was cultivated to a depth of from 16 to lb inches,

and laid up in ridges in order that the sewage might run down the furrows,

while the ridges were ijlantod with cabbages and other vegetables.

The Committee lias adopted the same mode of investigation in this as in

other cases, and the following is a description of their operations.

   It was thought addsablc in this, as in other examinations of se\yage-farms,
that inspections should be made at two seasons of the year,--in winter, when
the laud is saturated with rain or frozen, and again in summer during dry

weather, when there is the greatest activity in vegetable life.
   The first examination of the farm was made in January last, in very wet

weather, when the system was in operation as above described. Samples,

extending over a period of seven days, were collected of the sewage as it

entered the farm, and of the effluent water from the outfall drain before de-

scribed. Gaugings were taken of the flow of both the sewage and efliuent

water for eight days, with the following results :

eight days. The samples were taken, as in the previous ease, at the rate
of y77,^y y part of the flow at the time of taking. The following arc the
results of the gaugings on this occasion :

   The tliuuderstorm which occurred on the Gth July afforded further proof
of the connexion between the river-water and that of the effluent dram.

On the morning following the storm the Avater in the river had risen 7 feet

6 inches perpendicular, and on walking along the bank the Inspector found
the river-water percolating through and flooding the ground 18 inches deep.
The water in the effluent drain was 3 feet 6 inches deep, and was estimated
to be running at the rate of 3500 to 4000 gallons per minute.

   The surface of the filtering areas was prepared for cultivation in the spring
of 1871, and in June of that year cabbages were planted and mangolds sown ;
and the crops were sold in the autumn, yiekUng very good prices. As soon
as cleared they were replaced by others, some of which are now in the ground,
and some have been sold at high prices.

   The adjoining land at Troedyrhiw, belonging to the Local Board, has been
cultivated as a sewage-farm proper with complete success, the croj^s grown
being of a high class. The Eoard also intends to apply the sewage to the

land before i-eferred to in the valley of the Taff, but has reduced the quantity
previously intended to be taken by 112 acres, since the success of the downi-
ward-filtration system has been demonstrated. It will of course be under-
stood that this latter system is in this case only intended to be used in
conjunction with the ordinary sewage-irrigation ; and, considered as a means
for the disposal of the sewage, and especially of the night-sewage, there
can be little doubt of the success of this method. But whether it would be

equally favourable in other cases, when solely relied on for the disposal and

purification of the sewage of other towns, and under all the difterent con-
ditions as to soil, water, strength of sewage, &c., is a subject upon which

there may be considerable doubt, but which is, nevertheless, a proper one

for further investigation.

    The Rivers Pollution Commissioners have recently presented another Report
to Parliament, in which they describe the operations at Troedyrhiw ; and they
therein admit that the fears expressed in their first Report, that the manurial
properties of sewage would be entirely lost in this process, and that the
treatment of the sewage of a large town by it would probably result in a

--nuisance, have not been borne out in this case.
    The Commissioners state : ·" Our analyses show that the effluent water
entering the Taff from the Mcrthyr intermittent fdters was of even a more
highly satisfactory degree of purity than the samples which we examined
resulting from the process carried out on a small scale in our laboratory ; but
a comparison of the proportions of chlorine in the sewage and effluent
water shows that the whole of the latter is not derived from the former.
AVe find, in fact, that each gallon of the sewage, on June 19, 1871, had
become mixed with 2-2 gallons of subsoil-water, and that on October 20,
1871, each gallon of sewage had become mixed with 1-9 gallon of subsoil-

water. This result involves the assumption that the subsoil-water contained
the same proportion of chlorine as that present in the water of the neigh-
bouring Taff, which, according to our analyses, has 1-2 part of chlorine in

100,000 parts."
    It will be seen that this opinion of the C!omraissioners, founded upon

chemical analysis, more than confirms the conclusion of this Committee,
based upon the results of the gaugings taken, that the effluent sewage is
diluted with twice its bulk of comparatively pure water.

    The Commissioners consider, nevertheless, that the net result of the action
of the soil of the intermittent filters upon the sewage was highly satisfactory,
150 REPORT 1872,

attention being drawn at the same time to tlic exceptionally -weak character
of the sewage ; and bearing this in mind, they snggest that " it may be neces-

sary, in order to secure efficient pnrification, to lay out as intermittent filters
even double the area of land per 10,000 of population that is employed at

Merthyr Tydfil, where only from two to five acres per 10,000 people were
being employed."

   The following are the analyses of the samples taken by the Committee :

Sewage-Farm at Merthyr Tydfil. Analyses taken 10th to loth January, 1 872.

sioners cousidercd the subsoil-water to contain as much chloriue as the

·water of the river TafF, whereas actual analysis of it shows it to contain only

0-92 against 1*2 of chlorine in the river-water. Had we taken the composi-

tion of the river-water as given by the Commissioners, the dilution would
have appeared in this case to be 1-7 gallon of subsoil-Avater to 1 of sewage,

instead of 1-39 to 1.

   Now the total nitrogen in solution in 100,000 parts of sewage was 1*40,

in the effluent water 0-G5, and in the subsoil-water 0-05 (see Table).
Again, one volume of this sewage, mixed with 1-39 volume of this subsoil-
water, would give 2-39 volumes of water, containing exactly 0-07 part of

--nitrogen in solution in the 100,000 parts that is to say, that the apparent

diminution of the nitrogen in solution is, within a small fraction, entirely due
to dilution with subsoil-water ; and the nitrogen retained in the soil is eipial
to the amount in the suspended matters of the sewage, that is to say, rather
more than a quarter of the total nitrogen.

   What is most important, however, is that, although all the nitrogen

originally in solution is lost, it is almost all oxidized; for about \\ of the
nitrogen in the effluent water is in the form of innocuous nitrates and

nitrites.

   In the summer the dilution with subsoil-water was, according to the
gaugings, equal to about twice the volume of the sewage. As the chlorine
in the subsoil-water was not determined in the summer, we can only say that

the smaller proportion of total nitrogen in solution in the effluent water
seems to confirm the results of the gaugings.

   The effluent water this summer was not quite so pure as last winter, but
still four fifths of its nitrogen was in the form of nitrates and nitrites.

   It is to be noted that the sewage was cooled by its percolation through the
soil, and especially so in summer.

   The general results seem to be that by the process the suspended matters
are removed, and the ammonia and nitrogenous organic matters in solution
are almost completely oxidized, and escape in the effxuent water as nitrates
and nitrites ; so that the sewage is satisfactorily purified, though the process
cannot be looked upon as one of utilization.

         Section VII. Breton's Farm, near Bomforcl.

It will be in the remembrance of the members of the British Association

that the Committee has been conducting a series of observations on the appli-

cation of the sewage of the town of Romford to this farm, both as to the

purification of the  sewage and its utilization  as  a  manure                                     accordingly the
                                                                                                ;

observations and analyses recorded in previous years have been continued

during the past year, and the results will be found in the accompanying

Tables.

The Committee have, however, extended their observations still further

during the past year, and have supplemented them by the particulars of the

crops which have been grown on the farm during the twelve months from
March 25th, 1871, to ]\Iareh 24th, 1872, both days inclusive. But to make

this inquiry more complete, and of greater practical utility, the Committee
made an alteration in the form of the analysis of the sewage and effluent

·water, so as to determine the total nitrogen.

  --The observations Avhich were made in rolalion to the crops gave the fol-

lowing results ;
--152 REPORT 1872.

                                                                   tons.

The quantity of sewage from the town received on tlie farm from

March 25th, 1871, to March 24th, 1872, inclusive, is, according

to the gaugings                                                    410,787

The quantity of efliuent water returned from the land to the

tanks and rejnimped, during the same period, is                    52,406

The quantity of sewage, dilute or otherwise, which we have to

account for is therefore                                           469,253

According to the cropping table the quantity of

sewage applied to the cropped land (chiefly by

jiumping, hut also to a small amount by gravita-

tion) during the aforesaid period is                380,227 tons.

Mr. Gooch (the adjoining farmer) was supplied with  4,131

reckoned as part of the farm proper)                933

Total quantity                                      385,291 tons utU'ized.

Leaving 83,902 tons, which quantity was run upon a plot of land at the
lower part of the farm by gravitation and simply filtered, during periods

when it could not be put on the farm, owing to further drainage-works

being in progress.

   Prom Table III. it appears tliat the 380,227 tons of sewage so used con-
tained 21'0245 tons of nitrogen, and that the total amount of effluent water

l"unning from the subsoil-drains during the twelve months, viz. 195,536 tons
(of which 52,460 tons were returned to the tank, and repumped with the
sewage on to the land, and the remainder discharged into the river Rom),
contained 2-2430 tons of nitrogen, or approximately one tenth part of that

applied in the sewage.

   It must, however, be remarked that the figures in the columns marked * are
calculated from the results of the analyses of the sewage and effluent water
during the corresponding period of the present year (1872), as the method
of analysis employed before July 1871 did not give results in the same
denomination as that now used.

   The total amounts of nitrogen in the sewage and effluent water respec-
tively were calculated from the results of the analyses during the various
l^eriods ; and the absolute averages were, for the sewage 5-529 parts, and for
the effluent water 1-147 part in the 100,000.

    In Table IV. "will be found a detailed description of the crops, arranged
according to the plots into which the farm is divided. The figures in columns
III., VII., X., and XI. are as exact as possible, but those in columns VIII.,
IX., and XII. are at the best only approximations. The figures in column
VIIL, from which those in columns IX. and XII. are deduced, profess to
represent the quantities of sewage applied during the twelve months to the
several crops and plots ; but it is obvious that with the means at the disposal
of the Committee no precise measurements of these quantities could be ob-
tained ; for to gauge the quantities of sewage applied at various times to

twenty-four plots with separate subdivisions, each having its own conduit,
would require a preliminary outlay in plant estimated at £500, and the con-

stant services of four additional educated assistants at probably not less than

£250 a year each. The only way, therefore, that even approximate figures
could be obtained for this column was by recording the number of acres to
which the measured daily total quantity of sewage was applied, and assuming
       ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.                         153

that it -was equally distributed over those acres-- an assumption which,
although giving a fair average approximation in the totals, necessarily

often gives fallacious results in the particular instances, because, while
some portions of the land had been consolidated by previous dressings of
sewage, other portions sewaged at the same time were loose and hollow from

recent cultivation, and therefore absorbed very much greater quantities of

sewage.

   Table V. gives a summary of the totals of Table IV., and in addition the

approximate estimates of nitrogen corresponding to the approximate estimates

of sewage, and also the amounts of nitrogen contained in the various crops,
as calculated from proportions given by the best authorities. In all cases,

however, the grand totals may be relied upon, as where they were not

obtained by actual measurement they are (as, for instance,'in the case of the
weights of crops) the ultimate results of a very large number of carefully

obtained averages.

   Table VI. is also a summary of Table IV., but arranged according to the

crops instead of according to the plots. It will be at once seen, from the
remarks already made, that the separate total amounts of sewage, and there-

fore of nitrogen, assigned to each crop are much less reliable than the cor-
responding numbers for the plots ; but, as in the last case, the grand totals

(which are, of course, identical with those in the corresponding columns of

the previous Table) are either absolutely correct or very reliable.

   The important result to be deduced from the grand totals in these Tables
is, that of every 100 parts of nitrogen distributed over the farm during the
twelve months, 10-67 parts, or about one tenth, were found in the effluent

water; 41-76, or approximately four tenths, were recovered in the crops,
making together about half; and 47-57 parts, or in round numbers the
other half, were unaccounted for. Of this half a portion must have remained

in the soil; and as the average composition of the soil previously to the
application of the sewage was determined by the Committee (see Second

Report, to the Meeting at Liverpool), it is intended to determine the pro-
portion of this unaccounted-for nitrogen which actually does remain in the

soil at various depths.

   The Committee thinks it right to call attention prominently to the fact that
the above proportions (representing the manner in which the nitrogen of the
sewage was ultimately disposed of in the case of Breton's Farm, during the

twelve months to which the Tables refer) are, for the sewage and effluent

water, as absolute and exact as accurate gauging and careful analysis can

make them, and are, for the crops, calculated by means of the most reliable
published data ; they are, moreover, the final results obtained from a much
greater number of continuously applied observations over a greater area, and

with a much greater variety of crops, than have ever hitherto been scien-

tifically made.

   The two main results of practical importance which, from the evidence of

--the observations, may be accepted as generally attainable are : first, that less

than eleven per cent, of the total nitrogen applied to the land escaped in the

effluent water, and of that only a fractional percentage  in  an  organic  form
                                                                                                  ;

--and, secondly, that upwards of forty per cent, was actually recovered in the

crops grown upon the land a proportion which must be considered highly

satisfactory (especially when the extreme porosity of the soil and limited area

of the land are taken into account), as in the experiments of Messrs. Lawes

and Gilbert only from forty to sixty per cent, of the nitrogen applied in

solid manures was recovered in the crops within the season of application.

ajiount and composition of the Sewage applied to the land during the twelve
mouths under review (the amount given as applied to each plot being neces-

--sarily, at the best, only an approximation) the amount of the various Crops,

as estimated from the weight of average samples, and their composition as far
as it could be ascertained from the most reliable data, viz. tables furnished
by Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert, and those published in the Second Report of

--the Sewage of Towns' Commission and the amount and composition of the

effluent water.

   Tables V. and VI. also show the amount of nitrogen unaccounted for,
which either remains in the soil or has partly drained away into deep subsoil-

waters.

      the Committee consisting of Prof. W. J. Macquorn RankinEj
   C. W. Merrifield, F.R.S., Mr. F. J. Bramwell, and Mr. Alfred

   E. Fletcher (Secretary).

Your Committee have to report that, owing to the business-eugagements of

the Members, it has been found imjjossible to hold a meeting at a sufficiently
early date to enable a systematic plan of operations to be agreed to and acted
upon, and also that a proposed experimental trip in a yacht has been un-

avoidably postponed. No expense has been incurred, and no part of the

grant of =£30 has been drawn.
   Your Committee recommend that they should be reappointed, and that the

sum of ^30 should again be placed at their disposal.

YoTTR Committee have the pleasure of reporting that every branch of rainfall
work continues in efhcient working order, and that, notwithstanding the very
limited funds at our disposal and the long illness of our Secretary during the
winter, all arrears have been overtaken, and, owing to the completeness of
the orgp.uization, no hitch or interruption occurred.

   At the Meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh, very strong repre-
sentations were made to your Committee respecting the desirability of es-
tablishing additional rain-gauge stations in different parts of the Highlands

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and as your Committee had long been aware of the necessity which existed
for these stations, and, moreover, as somewhat larger funds than usual were
at their disposal, they resolved on taking every means in their power to secure
the efficient establishment of these stations. In addition to ordinary cor-
respondence, oi;r Secretary took two special steps to secure the most promis-

ing possible distribution of the new gauges. In the first place he wrote to

iEr. Euclian, the Secretary to the Scottish Meteorological Society, acquaint-

ing him with the assent of the Committee, and requesting him to state what

number of gauges he coiild provide good observers for. On receipt of his

--reply ten gauges were sent to him, which he was kind enough to distribute

as follows :

1. Springfield, Tain, lloss.   G. Sannox, Arran.
2. Kilmalcolm, Port Glasgow.   7. Kilchoman, Islay.
                               8. Port Charlotte, Islay.
3. Arrochar, Loch Long.        9. Port Ellen, Islay.
4. Strahane, Brodick, Arran.  10. Clcnbaru Abbey, Mull of Cantiro.

5. Strathfillan, Perthshire.
ON THE RAINFALL OF THE BRITISH ISLES.                 177

The other step was to send the following letter to the Secretary of the High-
land liailway Company, whose line, as is probably generally known, traverses
much of the most thinly inhabited part of Scotland :

                                                                                                           " 62 Caniden Square,

                                                  " British Rainfall.

--"Dear Sir, At the Meeting of the British Association held at Edinburgh

last August, it was resolved that steps be taken to obtain observations of the
fall of raiu in those parts of Scotland in which they have not hitherto been

made ; a grant of money was voted for the construction of the instruments,
and I was directed to take such steps as might seem best calculated to secure
regular and trustworthy observations. As an indication that this application
is for no mere crotchet, I may mention that the Board of N'orthern Light-

houses are already assisting all round the coast, and the Scottish Meteorolo-
gical Society, the Marquis of Breadalbanc, and others inland. After all our

efforts, however, the route traversed by your line is very poorly supplied with
observers ; and I have therefore to ask whether 5'ou would cooperate in the
matter by instructing certain of your station-masters to make the necessary
observations and forward the results monthly. The gauges are similar to
(but smaller than) those used by the station-masters on the Manchester,
Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway ; they are extremely simjjle, and the ob-

servations (which may be made any time between 8.30 and 9.30 a.m.) only

occupy about two minutes : I should, of course, provide printed instructions
and blank forms. The preliminary arrangements to ascertain exactly where

additional observations are required have taken so long that there is now

necessity for somewhat prompt action to secure that the instruments shall aU

be at their destination a few days before the end of the year. I shall there-

myfore be glad of a prompt reply, especially as, after receiving it, either I or

colleague Mr. Buchan, of the Scottish Meteorological Society, mil have to

send communications to the ' Scotsman ' and other papers. I have only to

add that if the Dingwall and Skye line is not under your control, I should be

much obliged by a line or telegram stating to whom I should apply, unless,
indeed, you could submit the tenour of my views to the authorities of that

line, which would be the most rapid course. I enclose sketch of the gauge

and instructions, which can be further simplified for the special purpose, and

have only to add that, should any further explanation be required, I shall

inost cheerfully supply it.

                                 " Yours very truly,

" A. Dougall, Esq., Inverness:^  " G. J- SrsiONS."

   To this letter the following reply was received :

                                                                      " Highland Railway Company, Inverness,
                                                                                            I'ith December, 1871.

 --" Dear Sir, I have your favour of the 7th instant on the above subject,

and beg in reply to state that the Directors of tliis Company will be happy
to cooperate in the matter by instructing several of their station-masters to
make the necessary observations and to forward the results monthly. This
will apply to the Dingwall and Skye line also.

                                                                      " I am, yours faithfully,

    1872.
178 REPORT--1872.

    The result of subsequent correspondence was the establishment of a chain
of stations over the entire system of the Highland and Dingwall and Skye
railways. Fifty gauges, with pegs for fixing, instructions, and blank obser-
vation forms were sent to Inverness, and distributed and erected by the offi-
cials of the Company at various selected stations, with the exception of a few

·which are retained in store until the northern extension of the line will en-

able them to be placed in Sutherland and Caithness. It only remains to add
that the station-agents, with scarcely an exception, understand their work
and do it punctually and well. Another district in which additional stations
are urgently required is that traversed by the Caledonian Canal ; and there-
fore a letter similar to the one abeady quoted was addressed to the gentleman
who, our Secretary was informed, was iu charge of the Canal. As, however,
the letter has not been acknowledged, our efforts in that direction have been

futile.

    It is generally the case that expenditure on the part of this Association
leads to equal or greater expenditure for similar objects by other persons.

This has been specially the case with rainfall work, and an illustration may

be quoted from the events of 1 ist year. Simultaneouslj' with the above action

of the Committee, the Earl of Breadalbane (through his agent Mr. J. P. Smith,
C.E.) has undertaken to supply returns from a scries of stations between

Aberfeldy and Tyndrum and other important localities in the Avatershed of
the Tay and Rannoch. Several of the gauges were fixed by our Seeretar}'-,
and the sites for others selected by him ; and if the observations are regularly

taken they will be of great utility.

  A very limited number of gauges have also been supplied to I'emote districts

of England and Wales; but the price of rain-gauges is now so low, that there can
be but few persons, who are able and willing to take charge of a gauge, to whom
the cost can be prohibitory. Your Committee are fully aware that in many

parts of the country additional observations are desirable ; but there are so

many expenses incidental to the collection of the observations and their dis-

cussion, that they do not feel justified, considering the very limited means

at their disposal, in lending gauges except to very isolated stations. Their

Secretary will, however, be happy to render any information or assistance in

his power to persons who may be willing to  set up  gauges                                        and it is hoped
                                                                                               ;

that by tKe maintenance and development of the present organization, these

vacant spaces may gradually be occupied.

Owing to the illness of our Secretary, the forms of inquiry respecting the

positions &c. of aU the rain-gauges in the country (not only of those belonging

to this Association, but also of the much more numerous private ones) were not

issued as soon as was originally intended. About 1000 arc, however, now cir-

culated, and the rest will foUow in less than a month. Those which have been

returned have nearly all been filled up in a very complete and satisfactory

manner, auguring well for the success of the proposal.

Another step taken with the same object, viz. the attainment of precise

knowledge respecting the gauges in use, their eTrors and position, has been

taken during the past year. Our Secretary has long possessed a travelling-

case containing the standard measures necessary for verifying any rain-gauge

without removing it from its position ; and in previous reports we have given

the results of several hundred examinations of rain-gauges in situ made with

this apparatus. Owing, however, to oui' limited funds, this examination has

been obliged to be curtailed ; and as a partial counterpoise to this curtailment,

we have caused to be constructed a precisely similar testing-case, and pre-

senlcd it to the Scottish Meteorological Society, whose Secretary will in futiu'e

required for our next lleport.

 The onlj' remaining subjects to which we have to direct  attention  are  the

_

biennial tables for 1870-71, which are given in the Appendix, and the re-

suits of a comparison of the fall in each of those years with the averages at
the same stations and with the same instruments during the ten years 1860-

69, given in our last Report. This is given in Table I., and an abstract of
the same in Table 11.
           ON THE RAINFALL OF THE BRITISH ISLES.                               181

   Among the many points of interest brought out by this mode of treatment,
pcrliaps the only one to which we need call special attention is the general
distribution of rain during 1870 and 1S71. And lirst respecting 1S70 : the
accompanying sketch map (p. 179) shows that there were two areas in which

great deficiency of rain occurred, and that there was no division in which the
fall reached the average. The areas of deficieucy were the south-west of Eng-
land and the Avest of Scotland ; and on reference to Table I. it will be found
that several stations in those divisions had less than two thirds of their average
fall. The divisions in which the fall most nearly approached the average
were the north-east of Scotland and Yorkshire, the latter owing to a very
heavy local fall in North Lincolnshire, in October 1870, having partially ex-
tended into the former county.

   In 1871 the fall was not very much below the average (only 5 per cent.),
and the chart docs not reveal such prominent features as in 1870. The

greatest differences are found in the two sides of the north of Scotland, no
other division differing more than 6 per cent, from the mean of the whole ;
and even this is mainly due to a belt of excess running north-eastward across
the centre of England. This belt, moreover, is due to a single rain, that of
September 6th, which in South-east Yorkshire amounted to nearly four inches,
and to between one and two inches at nearly all stations thence south-west-

ward to Devonshire. The area of that rain, it may be as well to state (in-

cluding only those parts at wliich upwards of an inch fell), was about 14,000
square miles ; and taking the fall at the low average of one and a half inch,
not less than 1,357,000,000 (thirteen hundred and fifty-seven million) tons
of water fell during the twenty-four hours.

Jleport of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. Dr. Ginseurg^ W.

   Hepworth Dixon, Rev. Dr. Tristram, F.R.S., General Chesney,
   Rev. Professor Rawlinsox, and John A. Tinnk, appointed for

    the purpose of undertaking a Geographical 'Exploration of the
    Country of Moab.

              Report on tlie Exploration of Southern Moab.

                     By Cheistian D. Ginsbtteg, LL.D.

The expedition left London on Wednesday, Jauuaiy 10th, 1872, and

arrived at Jaifa on Monday, January 22nd, about eleven o'clock in the

morning. The party consisted of Dr. Ginsburg, Dr. Tristram, and Mr.

Johnson. Mr. Klein, the original discoverer of the Moabito Stone, arranged

to join them at Jerusalem. The object of the expedition was to get to Moab

as soon as possible ; it was determined not to tarry in the Holy Land, how-

Weever much some of us felt tempted to explore the country.                                                         therefore

proceeded, at 3..30 p.m. on the same day, to Ramlch, taking Lydda on our

Tvay to Jerusalem. Early in the morning of the following day (January

23rd) we started for Jerusalem over Beth-Horon, and reached the sacred city

in the dark.

After waiting six days at Jerusalem for an escort, and making the neces-

sary preparations, we left for Hebron January 30th, at 10 a.m., where we

arrived about six o'clock in the evening of the same day. Here we engaged

Abou Dachouk, the 8heikh of the Jehalin tribe, to conduct us safely to

Kerak. He entrusted his old uncle, Abou Salama, to head the escort ; and

we left Hebron at 1.30 p.m. on Thursday, February 1st. As it had been

determined to enter Moab by the south, we now made our way to Engedi,

Umand arrived at  Ghazelat at 5.30 p.m.

Though this place is halfway between Hebron and Engedi almost in a

straight line, and though the old Abou Salama, our guide (who, like his an-

cestors, was born and brought up in this neighbourhood), has acted as a guide

Umto former explorers, yet he does not seem to have mentioned                                                       Ghazelat

to those few travellers who have come this way before to explore the basin

of the Dead Sea, nor can it be found in the most recent maps of Syria.

  We pitched our tents for the night at this supposed new place, near the

encampment of the llaabneh tribe. At 10.5 a.m. on Friday (February 2nd)

we left for Engedi, where we arrived at 4.30 p.m. Here we encamped near
the beach of the Dead Sea, and opposite the Moab shore and mountains, to

which we were maldng our way. We left Engedi in the afternoon of

the following day, which was Saturday, and determined to pitch our tents

for Sunday at Sebbch.

   Between Engedi and Sebbeh we passed on the shore of the Dead Sea the

--following four Wadys : Wadj- Ghar, which is close to Engedi, and which we

crossed  at   12.37 p.m.                                                       this  Wady, which  our  old  Sheikh  solemnly  assured
                                                                            ;

us was Ghar, is marked both in Van de Yelde's and in Lynch's maps as

Areyeh. The next is Wady Chobrah, which, according to Mr. Klein's most

painstaking cross-questioning, we found to be the proper spelling, and not

Khuberah, as it is spelled in Yan de Velde's map ; this AVady, which we

reached at 2 p.m., is an hour and twenty-three minutes from the former one.

The third Wady, which is an hour's distance from the second, and which is

marked in Van de Velde as Wady Halil, we were jjositively assured is Wady

Mochrath ; whilst the fourth Wady, which is about forty mimites' distance
from the third, and which has no name at all in Van de Velde, we were tol^
GEOGRAPHICAL £XPL011ATI0\ OF MOAB.                              211

is Ncmriyeh. The distance between this Wady and Wady Seyal, where wo

camped, we did in a little less than an hour.

Having spent Sunday, February 4th, at Sebbeh, and explored the ruins of

the famous fort, we started on Monday, at 7.45 a.m., for the AYady Zuweirah,

where we arrived at 3.30 p.m., and encamped for the night. In the seven
hours and three quarters which it took us to get from Wady Seyal to the

AVady Zuweirah, we passed no less than ten Wadys, respectively called

(1) Wady Sebbeh, (2) Wady el Kattar, (3) Wady Havhav, (4) AVady Senin,
(5) Eabbat el Jumuz, (6) Wady el Kitter, (7) AYady Mersed, (8) AVady
Chasrurah, (9) AYady um Berrek, and (10) AYady JSTejd.

   Of these ten AVadys, which are almost equidistant, only sis are laid down

in A^an de Velde's map ; and even of these six the names of three only cor-

respond, the names of two out of the three being reversed (viz. Nos. 4 and

Um5 in this Report), whilst the names of the other three (viz.  el Bedun,

UmAYady Hatrura, and  Baghek) arc not to be found. It may be here

remarked that AYady Ncmriyeh, which, according to our guide, is on the

south of Sebbeh, is in Yan de Yelde's map on the north, that the cliffs come

up quite close to the sea between AA''adys 8 and 9, leaving no beach whatever,
and that we had here to make our way over the rocks. This fact is not

pointed out in A'an de A^elde's map.

Being determined to cross the dangerous Valley of Salt early in the day,

we left the Zuweirah at 6 a.m. on Tuesday, February Gth. Before leaving

this remarkable spot we were determined to explore it, as well as the range
of salt mountains which is known by the name of Khafhm or Jebel Usdum.
It will be remembered that this is the spot marked in De Saulcy's map, as

well as in the map of Palestine used in our British schools, as the site of
Sodom ; indeed De Saulcy declares that he saw here " the ruins of a build-
ing which was anciently a part of Sodom." Anxious as some of our party

were to see the relics of the doomed city, a careful inspection of the heap of

stones referred to left no doubt upon the mind that they are the remains of

a mediaeval square tower, which was erected here to protect the labourers in

the salt mountains who carried on traffic with Hebron and other towns.
   Between the Zuweirah and our entering the VaUey of Salt we passed the

marvellously torn and rent salt mountain, as well as three Wadys. Our

Sheikh, Abou Salama (the brother of the very man who was De Saulcy's

guide, and who gave him such minute information about the ruins of Sodom),
could not even tell us the name of any of the AA^adys. One of these had
actually bored a tunnel through the salt mountain, and thus made a remark-
able hole through the cave in Jebel Usdum. The beach now was nothing

less than a soft slimy mud. The distance between the AYady Zuweirah and
the extreme point of the Es Sabkah, where we began crossing it, is an hour

and a half. At 7.30 we entered upon the margin of the barren flats of back-

water. After marching for about three hours knee-deep in slush, and cross-

ing seven drains, some of which were dry and some still draining, we arrived

in the front of the Saphia at 10.3 a.m.

Here our troubles began. Seeing our cavalcade crossing the Salt valley,

the Moabites must have thought that we were fair game for plunder, or that
we were come to invade their homesteads. On approaching the Saphia, we

found three tribes arrayed against us in front of the wood, beyond a narrow

intervening stream. The grotesque mob, as we nearcd them, uttered shrieks,

yells, and war cries, firing off their few guns, and refusing to let us enter

their territory. Abou Salama, our old Sheikh, and Daud, our dragoman,

with a few of our Bedouins, bravely jumped over the stream. The horses of

                                                                           q2
212 REPORT--1872.

the old Sheikh and the young dragoman fell into the water, and the riders

were soon seen rolling on the ground and struggling with their enemies.

One of our Bedouins was Ij'ing prostrate on the ground, and bleeding pro-
fusely. After a few minutes the Sheikh and the dragoman were again on
their legs and parleying with their assailants, assuring them with solemn
oaths that we had not come to invade the country. "VVe were at last allowed
to cross, and were led by these bands of robbers into the Saphia, where a
place of encampment was assigned to us about three miles towards the north.

After pitching our tents Ave clearly saw that our safety consisted in keep-

ing together, and not straying singly into tlio wood, since these robbers were

lurldng behind the trees and bushes for prey. The three tribes who occupied

the Saphia, and who now considered us fair game, are the Bene Attia, the

WeMaaz, and the Warroney.  were, in fact, virtually prisoners, inasmuch

as we did not venture to go beyond our tents ; and we therefore deemed it

more prudent to remain within our encampment the rest of the da}% which

was Tuesday, February 6th. In the mean time the robbers secretly des-

patched messengers to the Mugelly of Kerak to inform him that a batch of

European magnates were in the Saphia, and that they too should come and

have their share out of us. The son of the Mugelly Sheikh of Kerak, as it
might be supposed, immediately came over and declai'cd tliat we were in the

hands of cut-throats and robbers, and that he came to save us from them.
From the respect and deference which the Saphia tribes paid him we believed

his declarations, and indeed began to feel ourselves more secure and at

liberty.

  We now determined to explore the Saphia and the extensive ruins in the

neighbourhood. To do this we had to negotiate with the Sapbia robbers,

not only for permission but for escort. Their demands were exorbitant. As
we decided to see what could be seen here Ave made the best bargain Ave
could; and about 11 a.m., February 7th, we started on our explorations, ac-

companied by eight of the Saphia princes on horseback. Our direction Avas

south-Avest of the Saphia, and we rode through a forest of acacia, thickets of
tamarisk, and dwarf palms, till we came to very extensive ruins. These

ruins, according to our guides, are divided into three parts ; one is called

Sheikh Isa (Jesus), the other Kasur el Bashaira, and the third the Mashnaka
(hanging-place). In the second of these ruins A^e saw corpses of women

lying about.

   After carefully inspecting the ruins, which cover between one and two

miles of the ground, it may be inferred that though the bulk of those which

still rise to a considerable height above the ground are decidedly remains of

mediaeval sugar-mills and other buildings of that period, the foundations, and

indeed the larger portion of the hcAvn stones strewn aboiit, are as decidedly

partly rehcs of buildings of the lloman period and partly the remains of edi-

fices of a much older date than the lloman occupation of this district. They
most probably exhibit the Moabite fortified frontier, both against the Jews
on the west of the Dead Sea and against the Edomites on the east and south-.

east.

   The fact that this is the southern frontier of Moab suggested another con-
clusion, which elucidates a geographical remarlc in the Pentateuch on the
limits of Moab that is greatly obsciu'cd, and is perfectly without meaning in
the authorized version. In Numbers xxi. 12, 13, we are told that the
Israelites removed from Zared, "and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
which is in the Avilderncss that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites."'

This verse therefore gives the Arnon as the northern limit of Moab, thus
             GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLOKATION OF MOAB.                       213

assuring the Israelites that all north of the Arnon up to Ileshbon is to be

theirs. In confirmation of this statement, the sacred writer qiiotes in the

verse immediatel}' following the declaration made respecting the frontiers of

Moah from " The Book of the AVars of Jehovah/' wherein the M'hole extent

of Moab from south to north is most minutely fixed, and the two boundaries

are distinctly specifi^ed, viz. the southern boundary is Vahab in Suphah

[Saphia], and the brooks of Arnon the northern boundary.

Completely surrounded by the escort of these savages, we left our encamp-

ment at 8 A.M. As our tents were pitched almost in the centre of this oasis,

we passed through, for about two miles, a forest of acacia, tamarisk, dwarf

palms, and reeds on the shores of the Dead Sea, bearing north-north-east.

UmAt about 8.20 we reached the ruins of  el Hashib, and about 8.40 we

crossed the Wady Korcha.

The name of this Wady disclosed a remarkable fact, which Dr. Giusburg

believes will henceforth definitely settle a geographical point mentioned in

the famous inscription on the Moabite Stone. On this triumphal pillar King

Mesha tells us, in line 3, that he erected the monument in question at Korcha.

In lines 21, 24, 25 we are told that this king built and greatly fortified
Korcha after the expulsion of the Jews from Northern Moab ; and though

the word is treated as a proper name, and hence is without the article, yet

epigraphists of great distinction maintain that the word, according to its

form, cannot be a proper name, and therefore is the Flat-land or Market,

Now the existence of a Wady named Korcha, spelled in exactly the same

way as on the inscription, leaves, it beyond the shadow of a doubt that Korcha

on the Moabite Stone is the proper name of a town. When, in the sequel,

we come to Dibon, we may be able to show the position of this town.

Going on still due north we came (circa 9.2 a.m.) in about twenty-two

minutes from Wady Korcha to Wady Mirwacha, and in an hour and a quarter

more reached the ruins of Numeira (i. e. circa 10.15). These ruins are in

extent more than half a mile, and cover a surface of imeven ground. The

stones of ancient buildings, which are strewn about in all directions, are

mostly very large, about a foot and a half in diameter, but roughly cut.

Some foundations of buildings, as well as the remains of a quadrangular wall,

ai'c distinctly discernible. The great geographical interest of this place arises

from the fact that it figures on the maps of the few eminent travellers who

have explored this region as the site of two remarkable places mentioned in

the Bible. Thus Irby and Mangles (p. 448), as well as Lynch (p. 345),

identify it with the ancient Zoar, to which Lot and his daughters fled for

shelter at the destruction of Sodom ; whilst De Saulcy marks it as the site

of Zeboim, which Avas destroyed at the same time as Sodom. The locality,

however, as well as the name, correspond far more with the ancient Nimrim

mentioned in Isaiah xv. 6, and Jeremiah xlviii. 34, than with either of these

hypotheses.

Marching due north for about three quarters of an hour, we entered a

thicket of thorny trees and bushes, and then crossed Wady Azzal at 11.30 a.m.,

Weleaving a fringe of reeds near the beach of the Dead Sea to our left.

co-ntinued our march north-east, ascending a hill and leaving the promontory

Weor peninsula of Lissan somewhat to our left.  now ascended the southern

portion of the ravine through which the Wady Drah flows into the Dead Sea,

and crossed the Wady at about 2 p.m. Our journey was now almost due

east, ascending all along by the side of the ravine : and at 3.30 we reached

the top of the hill Drah, about 600 feet aoovc the Dead Sea. The scene of

our encampment here was most charming. To our left was the deep ravine
--214)
                      KKroKT 1872.

through which the Wady Kerak flows, with a perfect oasis on its slopes and

with a Bedouin encampment. To our right there was a perpendicular moun-

tain rising above us, on the summit of which are the ruins of an ancient

tower, which was evidently designed to guard the pass to Kerak. At our

back was the peninsula of El Lissan, and in front of us wore the steep moun-

tains of Moab, through the defiles and over the giddy heights of which Ave

had to wind our way to Kerak. By the lurid light of our bivouac fires this

remarkable spot looked sublimely lonely. The Mugelly with great cunning

selected this place as best serving his purpose.                                [

  We retired to rest, little dreaming what we should have to wake to. In

order to show how secure we were under his protection, and to luU us to

sleep pleasantly, the Mugelly got up a sham fight with the Saphia robbers,

charging them with mean behaviour towards us, and threatening to stab

them, for which purpose he actually drew out his dagger. As it was an aifair

between themselves, quarrelling about the money we gave them to buy them-

selves a lamb for supper, we did not interfere, but went to sleep as soon as

the deafening noise of these villains subsided, and rose early to resume our

journey to Kerak, which was only four hours and a half distant.

   It was here that the true character of the young Mugelly showed itself,

and that we learned to our bitter cost why he urged us to dismiss our Jehalin

escort, and why he adroitly selected this lonely spot for our encampment.

No sooner did he perceive that we had begun to strike our tents than he

demanded £70, and declared that he would not allow us to proceed unless

the money was forthcoming. He at last consented to take 25 napoleons ; and
at about 8 a.m. we started on our journey. What might happen to us at

Kerak when lodged in the clutches of this vagabond was more than any of us

Wedared to think of.  tried to comfort ourselves with the fact that one of

the gang was a Christian, and that he might be of help to us when the worst

Wecame to the worst.  proceeded on our journey not in a very good humour

Wefor exploring.  continued ascending a ridge of wild mountains, called

Akabat Charaza, crossed the Wady Charaza, and came to the ruins called

El Kabo {i. e. the cave), about 1000 feet above the Dead Sea (circa 9 a.m.).

Here we were told a Christian Sheikh lived in olden days, who exacted tri-

bute from all travellers to or from Kerak. The hill on the right of El Kabo

is called Botheneh, whilst the hill more to the north still is called Elmanzar

(i. e. watch-tower). Ascending still higher we climbed a ferruginous hill,

called Jebel el Hadid, passed Wady Umeshanan at 9..30, Wady Ruseis, with

the spring called Ayin Iluseis, at 11.15, reached the plateau of Omsidre at

12, and descended to the bottom of Wady Kerak at 12.40. Wc now began

climbing an almost perpendicular zigzag, leading to the summit on which

the ruins of this famous fortification, with its enclosed huts, are planted.

On our way to Kerak, the Mugelly was very anxious that we should camp

outside this vulture's nest in the deep valley below, which is exceedingly

fertUe, and where there are ruins of ancient buildings and a sugar-mill. To

this we decidedly objected, as we should have been cut off from all communi-

cation with the inhabitants, and in that case the vagabond could make any

demand upon us without the possibility of our appealing to any one. He had

therefore to lead us up to Kerak. The road consists of a very steep terrace

on a charming ravine, strewn all over with stones of different shapes and

various sizes. These stones being imbedded in the precipitous ascent, form,

in fact, crooked steps. So steep is the ascent, that we had to dismount and

Welead our horses.  reached the top at 1.30 p.m.

It was fortunate that wc went to examine the place immediately after our

arrival ; for soon after we returned to our tents the son of tlie Mugelly, who

brought us from the Saphia, came aud demanded no less than 600 napoleois,

as the remainder of the money for bringing us here and for allowing us to

Weencamp at Kerak.  of course refused to pay any thing, aud told him that,

although he had extorted 25 napoleons from us, he had no right to act in this

hostile manner. Seeing that we were determined not to be bullied out of

any more money, he forbade us to leave our tents, and we thus became pri-
soners. In this plight we were visited by the Greek catechist, whom Mr.

Klein knew. He procured us a messenger, whom we secretly despatched to

Jerusalem with a letter to Mr. Moore, the British Consul, informing him that

we were prisoners and that 600 napoleons were demanded of us.

As it was Saturday we made up our minds to a quiet rest in our tents for

two days, which we did not grudge, as we were tired and wearied out with

annoyance from the Kerak vagabonds. In the midst of our gloom, however,

Wea ray of hght appeared.      heard that Zadam, son of the Sheikh of the

Bene Sachar, with whom Mr. Moore the consul had made a contract at Jeru-

salem to take us from Kerak to the north of the Arnon, had arrived here, and

was the guest of the Mugelly.

The old Sheikh, the father of the Mugelly who had plundered us on our

Weway from the Saphia, we had not seen as yet.  were told that he camped

three hours from Kerak, that he was a better man than his rascally offspring,

and that though " his belly, too, was as large as our tent, his mind was as

Wewide as the ocean."  therefore sent a messenger to our future protector

and guide Zadam, requesting him to come to our tents. At about 12 a.m.

the old Sheikh of the Mugelly, with Zadam of the Bene Sachar, and a hosj

of Moal)ite grandees came to pay us a visit. To this old Mugelly Sheikh

in conclave we recited our troubles. He at once set us at liberty, and

told us we were perfectly free to go where we liked, that his country

was our country, and no man should dare to touch us or make any demand

of us.

WeOur joy was now beyond bounds.  were not only set at liberty without

money and without price, but we were told we might go wherever and do

whatever we Uked. To our further satisfaction we saw the old Sheikh taking

his seat on the ground among his magnates, fifty yards from our tents, with

his son opposite him in the ring, and heard him rating the scoundrel as hard

and as loud as possible, telling him that he had brought shame and confusion

of face upon his old father in the sight of these Consuls (which is the name

they give to distinguished foreigners), aud dei landing that the 25 napoleons

Wetaken from us should at once be restored.  even heard that the money

which had been divided between the chief robber and about a dozen minor

scoundrels was actually being collected. Being thus set at liberty, we devoted

the rest -of Saturday and the following day to the exploration of this stupen-

dous ruin and the town. The following is a summary of the results :

The very entrance into this ext aordinary ruin of Kerak, or the " Bock of

the Desert " (Petra Descrti), as it was called in the middle ages, is remark-

able. It consists of a long and winding passage of about 100 feet through a

high ridge of the natural rock, Avhich forms a cavern gate. It is in such a

zigzag that we could not see those of our party who were fifteen yards before

lis. It is surmounted by an illegible Arabic inscription. Looking at it from

the summit of the neighbouring mountains which overtop it, Kerak exhibits

the form of a rude triangle ; whilst from the bottom of the ravine it appears

like a vulture's nest, constructed on a peak more than 4000 fcQt above tho

Dead Sea.
--216 REPORT 1873.

To understand the plan * of this fortification, it is necessary to bear in

mind tliat the hill, the summit of which contains Iverak, rises on three sides

from a deep valley, thus yielding natural buttresses, which, from their im-

mense height and perpendicular form, defy any attempt at scaling them. It

is only the north-west and south sides which are joined to the neighbouring

mountains by crests of rocks ; these, therefore, require artificial protection,

and it is for this reason that the fortification consists of two distinct parts,

viz. the tower on the north-west and the castle on the south.

The tower is a large oblong building of immense height, constructed of

very huge and neatly cut sandstone. Yiewing it from the town, it looks like

three out of four skeleton walls of an unfinished edifice, being open towards

the defile. It is furnished with galleries and staircases inside the thickness of

its walls, putting the different stories of which it consists in communication

with each other. It presents its three faces (the circumference of which

measures about 131 yards) to the defence of the exterior, and is joined by

its two extremities to the town which it was designed to defend. The stones

of which it is built have been cut from the side of the rock on which it is

erected. By this process the north-western side has not only been separated

from its adjoining mountains, but the tower has obtained a very steep but-

-- --tress. From the Arabic inscription El Melelc Dalier Byhars in the central

wall, it is called " The Tower of Daher,"' or " The Tower of Bybars." It was

within this three-walled toAver that we camped, and were imprisoned in our

Wetents.  saw Jerusalem most distinctly from the top of this tower. The

castle or fortress on the south, which was designed to defend this side, left

by nature unprotected, is in form a long square, widening towards the north,

the north face being about 153 yards, the south 87, the cast 218, and the

west 240, thus making a cii-cumference of about 698 yards. It is separated

from the city on the north by a wide ditch, and is defended on the south by

an immense reservoir, which is flanked by an enormous ditch, more than

A98 feet wide, cut in the rock.  rampart, with galleries stretching across

the length of the enclosure of the castle, divides it into two courts, viz. a

lower court towards the east, and a higher court towards the west.

In the eastern or lower court is a chapel, with nave of 82 feet long, four

windows, tw.o in each side, and ending in a semicircular arch. There is a

staircase in the thickness of the north wall, which leads to the platform on

the top of the edifice. Irby and Mangles have noticed remains of large fresco-

paintings, one apparently representing a king in armour, another the mar-

tyrdom of a saint who has his bowels twisted out, as well as an imperfect

inscription in Gothic letters (p. 364). But with the exception of the inscrip-

tion nothing is now to be seen. This court also contains the dungeon.

In the angle of the Avestern extremity of the higher court is the gate of

the castle, which leads, through a long and narrow passage, to two other

doors furnished with portcullis and complicated defences. These had to be

passed before entrance could be obtained into the enclosure. The court con-

tains numerous cisterns and immense magazines of five or six stories high,

which are now partly dilapidated. This castle was built about a.d. 1143

by Payen, Avho was cup-bearer to the King of Jerusalem, and who received

Kerak as a fief after the execution of Knight Romanus.

   * Por a sketch of the plan of Kerak, as well as for an able treatise and some verbal com-

munications on the same subject, according to wliicli I have been enabled to correct and

supplement my rough notes, I tender my best thanks to M. Maiiss, the learned architect

of the Due de Luyne's expedition to the east of the Dead Sea. For the working out of the

--plan which was exhibited I am indebted to my wife. C. D. Gi.nsburq.

Between the Tower of Bybars on the north end and the castle on the south,

there arc ruins of numerous buildings as well as an immense reservoir.

The plateau on which the town is built measures in its greatest length

from north to south 852 yards, and in width from east to west 77G yards.

Taking it as a rude triangle, the north-east face of the rampart measures
about 1028 yards, the south face 8G8 yards, and the west face 732, making

a total of 2G28 yards. In other words, the plateau of the rock on which
Kcrak is built is not only more than 4000 feet above the Dead Sea, but is

surrounded by a rampart more than a mile and a half in circumference, ex-

clusive of the tower on the north and the castle on the south.

   But though the fortifications are of the crusading period, some of the ruins
in the town, and of the materials used in the construction of the modern

dwellings, are decidedly relics of the lloman occupation of this place. These

houses, which are some distance from the fortifications, are, as a rule, under

the ground. They exhibit a very extraordinary appearance at a distance,

since little more than the outlines of squares are visible above the ground.

Dr. Ginsburg rode over several of them without perceiving that he M'as on
the top of human residences. On going or descending into one of them, he
found it consisted of one large room only, and had a few arches thrown across
it, on which were the rafters. In this house, which was occupied by a rela-

tive of the Sheikh of Kerak, were the bases of four ancient columns, with a

Mosaic pavement in the centre, of which the occupant made a circular hearth,

Awith a raised rim around it.  fire was burning on it ; and as there was no

hole in the roof to serve as a vent, the whole room was full of smoke, so much

so that he could not remain there more than a few minutes, much as he

wished to examine the place. There wore also raised recesses in the room,
serving as a bed and as receptacles for corn. Part of the room also was set

apart for the horse, and the goats too were admitted. There is not a single

dwelling-place among the hundreds of houses with a window.
   The population of Kerak is about 8000, about 6000 Mussulmans and 1600

Greek Christians. The former eomit about 2000 muskets, and the latter

from about 500 to 600. After a minute inspection and examination of the
ruins of the place. Dr. Ginsburg could discover no trace whatever to justify

us in marking Kerak on our maps as the Kir Moab or the Kir Haraseth of

the Bible.

  We were now determined to make the best of our time ; and having heard

that the Sheikh of the Mugelly, who appeared as our second deliverer, was

Welikely to disappoint us, we endeavoured to see as much as possible.

therefore started early on the following day accompanied by two horsemen,

Wenephews of the Sheikh, to survey the neighbourhood of Kerak.  rode to

the south of the town over magnificent ridges, down rugged and steep ravines,

and across beautiful highland country from 8 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.

  We first came to the place called Gelameh el Sapcla, from which Ibrahim

Pasha bombarded the town.

   At 9.15, still travelling S.S.E., we reached the first ruin of Kirjathaim,
which is on a hiU. The stones which mark the basis of the walls are now
in a different position from what they originally were, and distinctly show
that the traces of the buildings which they indicate are of a much later date,

probably of the crusading period. As the summit of the hill is only about
1000 yards in circumference, and as the ruins on the slope around do not

extend very far down, the town must originally have been small. Still the
immense stones which are strewn about in all directions, and the extensive
caves on the ridges, show that it was in olden days a very strong and im-
218.    --. REPORx 1873.

portant place. There are terraces running down at regular intervals to the

bottom of the hill.

At 9.20 wc reached the sister hill, on which the second pait of Kirjathaim

stood. Its ruins are almost exactly like those on the other liill. And as the

terraces here like those there descend all around, the rings of which they

consist, as a matter of course, becoming wider and wider as they

near the bottom, the last terraces of the two hills meet at the foot, and so

connect the two parts of the town. For this reason the place was called

=Kirjathaim " the duuhk-towned." In each part we saw a deep well, with

thoroughly cemented walls, capable of holding a very large quantity of water.
As the crow flies, Kirjathaim docs not seem more than ten minutes from

Kerak.

At 9.30 we left Kirjathaim, and in less than ten minutes we reached a

place called lui-bach Xulet, and in about a quarter of an hour after (9.45) we

came to Kirbath Aziza. Here we found an old wine-jiress cut in the rock,

Aand on the other side of the rum we saw an enormous well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      very little

Wefurther on we came to Kirbath Nukad, and at 10.10 to Chorba Chaviya.

then reached (at 10.40) a tremendous natural cavern, called Gava, and got to
Mochra at 10.53. This is a very extensive ruin, and has some remarkable

cisterns, caverns, and other remains of former glory rarely seen in other

places. The most interesting part of this place, however, is in its bearing on

the history or geography of Moab as recently disclosed on the Moabite Stone,

inasmuch as it supplies one of the two missing places mentioned on this

Triumphal Pillar. In lines 13 and 14 of the inscription, Mesha, king of

Moab, teUs us that after capturing Atarotli and slaying its inhabitants, " the

men of Gad who dwelled in it from time of yore," he repeopled the place
Avith "the men of Mochrath." The context plainly shoAvs that these men

must have been faithful subjects upon whom Ihe king could rely, and that

hence their dwelling-place was south of the Arnon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               but as far as our knoAV-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

ledge goes, no such place has hitherto been identified. There can therefore

be hardly any doubt that this is the place.

Within live minutes of the aboA^e ruin (10.57) we came to a place in ruins

called Gel-gul. After an hour and a quarter (12.7) we reached Mode, where
Ave saw a Eoman mile-stone. The inscription was so defaced that we could

not decipher in Avhich reign it Avas set up. At 1.25 Ave passed the Wady
Medin. On our Avay back we examined the ruin Chorbath Theniah, which

is close to Kerak. It is an extensive ruin, and it is rather remarkable that

so large a fortification and town should have been erected so near the for-

midable forts of Kerak.

It was well that we had made use of our liberty thus to examine the

neighbouring countiy ; for on our return Ave found the old Sheikh Avith his

retinue of sons, cousins, nephews, brothers, and officials sitting in council

around and Avithin our tent. He heard that Ave Avere to leave Kerak soon ; and
as he wanted a pretext to plunder us, he told us lie had been infoi-med that we

had sent a messenger to Jerusalem to report his son's conduct. The fact is

that the Greek priest, Avho for some reason or other expected money from us,

and of course was disappointed, got to know that his catechist had secretly i^ro-
cured us a messenger, and reported to the Mugelly Sheikh that we had sent a
letter to Jerusalem. What harm this could have done to the old Sheikh was

a mystery, since he pretended to repudiate his son's robbery. The motive,

however, Avas apparent. In spite of all his cunning devices to conceal it, we

saw perfectly well that he wanted to extort money from us, and that he must

do it at once. This pretended deliverer of pui's therefore suddenly chaiiged
                                            GEOGKAriUCAL EXPLORATION OF M0A13.                               219

into an insulted enemy. He declared in the midst of his people in our face,

that he cared neither for the Governor of Nabulus nor for the Pashas of all

the East, nor for the Consuls at Jerusalem, and that he was determined to

send us back to the Saphia to the robbers, from whom he now said his son

had delivered us. The young Mugelly had therefore no more made his face

black by his conduct to us at the Drah as the old rascal declared before, but

rendered us unspeakable service by saving our property and our lives.

This was now the story of the old Mugelly Sheikh, and to this we had to

address ourselves. Our feelings may easily be imagined when we found our

professed friend suddenly changed into as great a robber as his son. The

Bene Sachar chief Avho came to Kerak to fetch us told us that it all meant

money, and that we must make up our minds to submit to another extortion.

The question was therefore discussed what would satisfy the old vagabond.

We decided to give him twenty napoleons and his brother five napoleons, and

with this he was satisfied.

With feelings of great relief we left the old ruined castle, congratulating

ourselves that we had at last actually escaped from this fiery furnace. But

we had not gone more than 300 yards when a very violent rain commenced,

accompanied by a terrific hailstorm. The horses refused to proceed, and we

had to return to take shelter behind the walls of the Greek church. In a

few minntas we were wet to the skin, and it seemed that even the elements

conspired against us to keep us at Kerak.

After waiting for an hour and a half behind the waUs and among the

tombs in this drenching flood, we made a fresh start at 12.30. The anxiety

of the muleteers to get away was so great that they would not allow the

storm to stop them, and had gone on without us. Our joy in leaving, which

was now brightened by a little sunshine, made us forget that we had tre-

mendous ravines to descend and precipitous heights to climb of thousands of

feet. It was only when we were actually facing these giddy heights and

depths that we began to think how their natural difliculties were now en-

hanced by the heavy rain. However, we got through without any further

accident than some of the mules falling down and upsetting the luggage,

which created a Babel of swearing and such an incessant shouting and cla-

mouring amongst the Arabs as only those can realize who have ever had the

misfortune to hear it.

On our way to Rabba, after ascending the next height, we passed along a

beautiful highland, which might be made exceedingly fertile by a little cul-

tivation                                    but these  Bedouins  prefer  plunder  to  work,  and^ only  sow  that
                                         ;

which they absolutely require for themselves and cattle. The whole journey

Wefrom Kerak to liabba took us three hours and a half.                                       passed through

Chorbath Rakin, a small ruin about an hour from Kerak, Bether, and Min-

char. Whatever these places may have been in olden days, at present only

large scattered stones and the bases of walls remain to show that at all events

some of the buildings were strong and capable of defence. At four o'clock

in the afternoon we reached Rabba.

   This is supposed to be Ar, the ancient capital of Moab (Dent. ii. 9, 29).

We camped on the site of an ancient pool, about 50 by 60 yards, and about

21 feet deep. There were three large caverns in the walls, which were a

godsend to us ; for it was pouring rain on our arrival here, and these caves

afforded shelter to us and our horses Avhilst the tents were being pitched.

Between our camp and the ruins of Rabba there was about a quarter of a

mile, and there were two more pools from Avhich the ancient city derived its

chief water-supply. As the. rain continued we could not do more than inspect
220 REPORT--1872.
                                                                                                                    .

the ruins before nightfall ; but early in the morning Dr. Giusburg and IVIr.

Klein went to examine them more closel)^ Unlike Kerak, Kirjathaim, and

other ancient places, the ruins of Kabba, which are about a mile and a half

or two miles in circumference, are situated almost on a level, Avith the ex-

ception of one part, which is on a very low hill. On the northern side are

the remains of an old temple, with several columns still standing. Qliere arc

on all sides caverns, large and small, cisterns of various dimensions, and wells

of all sorts, which show that the i^lace in its entirety must have been of great

importance. There are, moreover, scattered among the ruins, large blocks

of basalt, which are hewn into smooth stones for use, and which are evidently

of much older date than the bulk of the ruins.

It was here they saw a basalt slab, of almost exactly the same dimensions

as the celebrated Moabite Stone, which had evidently been prepared for an

inscription, but which, for some reason, had been left uninscribcd. Several

others of smaller size were also seen, which, from their slabby appearance,

Avere apparently intended for tablets. These ancient relics aiford every op-

portunity to the dealers in Moab and Jerusalem, whose cupidity has been roused

by the discovery of the Moabite Stone, to supply the demands of the market.

The impression that was formed of the ruins of Eabba is, that though there

are among them many vestiges of the Boman period, such as pillars, cisterns,

extensive roads, &c., there are very few relics of an older date. To examine

Habba thoroughly, as it ought to be done, one should remain on the spot, and

work quietly for at least a week, turn up all the important stones, and in-

vestigate and measure all the various pools, cisterns, and caverns. This,

however, we could not do. But after a close examination of the place and

its surroundings, they came to the conclusion that liabba is not the ancient

AEAi; the antiquated form of III, or  Moab, as it is stated on the most

recent maps. Eabba is almost in the centre of Southern Moab, whilst the

Scripture Ar Moab was on the confines of the Arnon, and marked the ex-

treme northern limit of the trans-Arnonic Moab, Vahab in the Saphia de-

fining the southern frontier (comp. Dent. ii. 36; Joshua xiii. 16; Numb,

xxii. 36, and ibid. xxi. 13 and 14). The Greek name Areopolis was first

given to the ancient Ar Moab on the Arnon, and afterwards, when Ar Moab

was destroyed by an earthquake (comp. St. Jerome on Isaiah xv.), it M'as

transferred to the modern Rabba.

  We left Eabba at 8.2.5 (Feb. 15th) on Thursday. At 9.30, travelling

N.N.E., wo came to a place called Kasr Eabba ({. e. the Palace of Eabba).

The ruins here, though small, are exceedingly massive. The stones of which

the palace was built are cnormousty large ; they are bevelled, and somewhat

resemble those of the old wailing-place at Jerusalem. The bases and cor-

nices of columns which lie about on the ground measure 4 feet 8 inches in

diameter. The fact that in many parts of the shattered walls the bevelled

part of the stones was turned the wrong way, shows that the buildings have

been shaken by a violent earthquake.

In leaving Kasr Eabba at 9.55 we saw, at a distance to the left, ruins on

a hiU, which are called Shichan. On the greater part of the way to these

ruins, the old Eoman road is still most distinctly traceable. Whilst some of

our party were marching with the mules to the Arnon, we galloped to Shi-

chan, which we reached at 11.20. It is 4700 feet above the Dead Sea, and

has a very remarkable cistern on its summit. The distance between Kasr

Eabba and Shichan is about 8 miles. In descending the summit we found

ourselves for at least a mile and a half on regular terraces, M'hich had evi-

dently been most carefully cultivated in olden days.^
           --

           GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION OF MOAB.                               221

   On leaving this place at 11.35, and marcliing to the Arnon, the change of
the soil was extraordinarily sudden. From the fertile ground around these
ruins we all at once came upon a most dreary wilderness, which was only

relieved by tremendous holes in the ground, and by dricd-up and stunted

bushes. It was not till we came close to the verge of the Arnon that signs

Weof fertility began to show themselves.    reached this awful ravine at

1.55 P.M.

The southern side, though not as perpendicular and as grand as the descent

at Engedi, is exceedingly steep, being 2150 feet deep. It took us fully an
hour and a half before we reached the stream at the bottom at 3.30. All

the way down the traces of the old Roman road and unfinished Homan mile-
stones are to be noticed. The stream is narrow and rapid, and to the right

of the descent are still to be seen the ruins of two arches of the bridge, which,

however, in its present form, is not older than the time of the Crusades.

The cliff at the northern ascent is 1900 feet high. As the road extends

over a wider ground, it is on the whole not so steep. It took, however, quite

as long a time to ascend it as the descent on the southern side occupied.

Here, where the maps put the ancient Aroer, Dr. Ginsburg and Mr. Klein

Aleft Dr. Tristram and his friends,  messenger had arrived from Jerusalem

with the sad tidings of the dangerous illness of Mr. Klein's eldest child. He

at once decided to return to Jerusalem, which was perfectly natural. Mr.

Klein was the only one who could talk with the Arabs, and we were almost

entirely dependent upon him for the information from the Bedouins. The

Arabs pronounce the same word differently ; and apart from a thorough

knowledge of the language in all its various provincialisms, it requires great

tact to obtain the necessary information from them. Mr. Klein, with his

complete mastery of the language, and especially his intimate acquaintance

\nth the ways, manners, and customs of the Arabs, not onlj'- knows how to

get information out of them (a tact which he acquired by twentj^ years' resi-

dence among and intercourse with them), but, above all, he understands how

to test the correctness of the information by a series of direct and indirect

cross-questioning, which is quite an Eastern art. As it appeared to Dr.
Ginsburg that Mr. Klein was thus an essential member of the expedition, he

determined to return with him.

   Dr. Ginsburg coiitinues:

  We left the Arnon at 7.30 a.m., February 16th ; travelling due north,

almost all the way on the remains of the old Iloman road, and passing the
imaginary site of the Biblical Aroer, we came to the ruins which go by the
name Dibau at 8 a.m., i. e. in about half an hour. From the fact that the

famous Moabite Stone was discovered here, I devoted some time to the ex-

amination of the place. The whole of this once celebrated stronghold is in

ruins ; there is not a single hut to be found on the spot. The circumference
of the ground on which the ruins lie prostrate is at least a mile and a half.

Like Kirjathaim in the south of the Arnon, this town was originally built on

two hills, the sloping terraces of which joined at the bottom ; and by this
means the place, which looked at a distance like two distinct cities at the

top, was joined into one at the bottom. jSTotwitlistanding its undoubted age,
few traces of antiquity are to be seen among the shattered ruins of the walls.

The old stones have evidently been used up for later buildings ; and it

would require a sojourn in the place fur at least a fortnight carefully to turn

up the foundations and the heaps of ruins to ascertain whether some other

valuable relics are to be discovered here.

From a careful inspection of the place in connexion with the ruins not far
222 iiEPORT-- 1872.

off, I am convinced that it is not the site of the ancient Dibon, but of Korcha.

My --reasons for this conclusion are as follows : i. In all the eight passages

of the Bible Avherein the name Dibon occurs (Numb. xxi. 30 ; xxxii. 3, 34 ;
Josh. xiii. 9, 17 ; Isa. xv. 2 ; Jer. xlviii. 18, 22), no data are given to fix its
exact site. The christening, therefore, of these ruins by the name Diban, on
the part of the Arabs, like the naming of many other localities, has been
suggested by Biblical explorers, ii. The Moabite triumphal pillar which was
found here gives us the direct information that Mesha erected it at Korcha,
a city which this monarch built. As no one who will examine the enor-
mously heavy fragments of this huge block of basalt, with its delicate inscrip-
tion, will suppose that it has been brought here intact from another place
without the inscribed letters being injured, the spot where it was found must
be the site of its original erection. And, iii., between this place and the
stream Valeh, an hoiu-'s distance, there are several old ruins, the names of
which our Bedouin guide could not tell. One of these is most probably

Dibon,

   After a careful investigation of this ancient site, we left to cross the north-
Arnonic portion of Moab. Our route was now to have been over the upland.
Going in a north-westerly direction, we passed several ruins, and crossed the
stream Valeh, about an hour from what is called Dibon. From this place,

instead of pursuing the usual course, due north over the highland, our Bedouin
took us westward, right over the range of mountains to Mayin, or what is sup-
posed to be Callirrhoe. In this charming valley, to the hot springs of which

Herod the Great resorted during his last illness, we pitched our tents close to
the encampment of the Awazim tribe, to whose protection we were recom-
mended by Abou Zadam of the Bene Sachar.

   Early in the morning, February 17th, we left for the Jordan, escorted by
Abou Wardy, the Sheikh of the Awazim. lie, too, led us across the range
of mountains instead of by the usual upland road. The most remarkable and

significant part of my experience, bearing on the value of the information

obtained from the Bedouins, I gained on this part of mj' journey. In looking

at a map of Palestine, it will be seen that this range of mountains has played
a most important part in the history of the Jews. From these heights Balak
king of Moab, and Balaam the prophet of Baal, beheld the Israelites en-
camped on the Plains of Moab. From here Moses the great lawgiver saw the
promised land : here he died and was buried. Hero we passed across the
very spot marked on the maps as Pisgah and Nebo.

   We had with us, from the Arnon to Mayin or Callirrhoe, a Bedouin who

w;a8 a native of Northern Moab, the tvhole extent of which is onlj- about

twenty miles in length and as many in width. The fact that he was the

only companion of Zadam, the magnate of the Bene Sachar, and that with
this chief he was to be our guide for more than a month, sufficiently shows

that he was no ordinary man of his tribe. From Mayin again to the
Plains of Moab and the Jordan wc had with us the Sheikh of the Awazim
himself, who was not only born and brought up in the neighbourhood, but
is the chief of the whole district. Yet neither tlic second in command of the
Bene Sachar nor even the chief himself of the Awazim could tell us a single
name of gorge, valley, mountain, or ruin between Diban and the Jordan.

    The reason of it is simply this. In Palestine, which has been visited by
 pilgrims ever since the fourth century, who came in search of the places
 wherein the events connected with the life of our Saviour have transpired,
 the law of demand and supply has brought to the surface whole regions
 which would otherwise never have been named. Those who came thousands

of miles under the greatest privations to do homage in the birthrphice of the
Saviour, on the various spots where the greatest of his miracles were per-
formed, -where he suffered, died, and was buried, were determined to have
the scenes. Hence the different sections of the Church, inspired by pious
devotion, and aided by the cupidity of the natives, have not only been able

to discover the place of every event, but to secure for themselves severally a
different spot where the same event was enacted.

   The ease, however, is different in Moab. Here no events connected with
the life of Christ have taken place. Here no pilgrims have come in search
of sites. Very few even of explorers have traversed the country. Hence
the natives, who can neither read nor write, and who are dependent for
information upon hearsay, have never heard from outsiders what places are
wanted, and therefore do not know them, and cannot supply them.

GeograpMcal Exploration of Moah. By Rev. H. B. Tristram, F.B.S.

The expedition for the exploration of the countiy of Moab, so liberally

aided by the grant of the British Association, set out from Jerusalem on the

30th of January. Our party was reinforced by Mr. E. C. Johnson, who proved

himself invaluable both as a surveyor and a photographer ; Mr. Buxton, not

less efficient as a photographer and observer ; Mr. Hayne, who devoted him-
self with great success to the botany of the country ; Mr. Mowbray Trotter,
to whose gun we were indebted for many a meal ; and the llev. F. A. Klein,
of Jerusalem, the discoverer of the Moabite Stone, whose thorough knowledge
of Arabic and of the people and the country rendered him an invaluable
member of the party, till suddenly recalled home by a melancholy domestic

affliction.

"VVe determined to enter the country from the south, as being the most

difficult and least known route, our course being by Hebron, Engedi, Masada,

or Sebbeh, Jebel Usdum, and thence across the Stbkha, or barren sand-flat,

which extends for several miles to the south of the Dead Sea. This we ac-

complished with a guard of the Jehalin tribe of Arabs. At the edge of the

Sebkha we were on the frontier-line of ancient Moab and Edom ; and here
we met with some little difficulty from a robber tribe, the Beni Atiyeh, with

whom, however, after a faint show of hostilities and a few random shots, we

Wowere able to make terms.  found the Ghor es Safieh, which we were able

to examine at leisure, very much more extensive southward and eastward

than it is marked in the maps. It is, in fact, a fertile belt scarcely raised

above the level of the Dead Sea, IG miles from north to south, and fed by

the numerous perennial streams and springs which gush from the lofty sand-

stone range that forms the buttress of the Hants Plateau of Moab. On the

heights above the southern extremity are the villages of Tufileh and Feifeh,

on the banks of streams, which we were not aljle to visit. Our exploration

of the Safieh was carried out under considerable difficulty, as the natives were

lawless, and we could only move with an escort of horsemen. However, we

were able to ascertain, in our rides with our guards and in several rambles

on foot, that there are no remains of importance in the oasis itself. The

principal ruins arc of some 'extent, indicating a well-built village, with

several fragments of columns and Roman work, called Kasr el Bushireh ; and

a little higher up is a tolerably perfect water-mill, and a Saracenic gateway

of rather mde construction, belonging apparently to a ruined Khan ; it ia
224 REPORT--ISrS.

now called " Mushnekkr," or " the gallows." No other ruius could we find.

We explored ou foot the widest part of the Safieh towards the Dead Sea, on

the edge of which a rank vegetation of sedge and reed takes the place of the

dense thickets of nuhk and dom tree which stud the cultivated plain, here

ahout four miles wide.

Leaving the Safieh we proceeded hy the route of Irby and Mangles to Dnia.

The day's journey led us through every conceivable variety of vegetation and

non-vegetation. Leaving tlie Nahr el Hassan, the great source of fertility to
the Safieh, we passed through a scrubbj' plain, rushes, canebrakes, and finally

a bare salt marsh, without a scrap of vegetation to the sea, and a gravelly

shelving slope, with scattered gnarled acacias above it; near its commence-

Umment is a ruined village,  el Hashib, not far from the Wady Grahhih.

The barren plain is fringed by a fetid ditch, well named Mir'whar, or " stink-

ing river," with salt and offensively smelling liquid. Having crossed the salt
plain, we came to the Nahr Hanyir and Nahr Nimeirah, salt streams. At
this latter are the mean and almost obliterated ruins of a large place, appa-

rently iinfortilied, and usually marked in the maps as the ancient Nimrim of
Scripture. This, however, we have reason to believe is incorrect, as the
position is defenceless ; and we were told of ruins higher up near the sources
of the stream in the mountains, which still bear the name of " the waters of

Nimcirah." Near them is another Scripture locality, " the brook of the

willows," which is given to the head of the next stream before it leaves the

mountains.

  A little above this lower Nimrim we visited the ruins of a fort, Ivhirbet es

Sheikh, which appears to have been nothing more than a watch-tower to

guard the road.

After crossing the Nahr es Asal, or Honey Eiver, we began to ascend the

shoulder of the Lisan, a mass of barren salt marl, without a trace of life, past

or present, and in a few hours reached Draa, generally said to be the an-

cient Zoar, after crossing the Wady Weydah, in which the palm-tree is

abundant.

Draa, though the seat of a bishopric in the time of Euscbius, has left no

traces beyond lines of foundations and heaps of sandstone, some of them

squared and dressed. But the deep glen on the crest of which the city stood

is richly wooded with palm, oleander, and other trees ; and its fertile belt can

be traced by the eye as far as the Mezraah, a wide, scrubbj^, tree-dotted plain,

opening on the bay to the north of the Lisan, and now covered with the

tents of the Beni Atiyeh. This has been traversed by Messrs. Palmer and

Drake.

From Dr.ia we ascended to Kerak by the route so well described by Irby

Aand Mangles.    fort, hitherto unnoticed, guards the pass about halfway

up, called El Kubboh. The character of the architecture is crusading, and

the local tradition makes it the stronghold of a Christian Sheikh. Just to

the south of this, the " Wady of the Willows " was pointed out to us. AVe

--calculated the ascent from Draa to Kerak to be 3720 feet, Dnia, thougli

on the brow of a bold shoulder, being 570 feet below the sea-level, and

Kerak 3180 feet above it (barometric).

Without pretending to compare the country with Switzerland, and at the

risk of incui'ring the sneers of those who, judging only by Ijigness, accuse

any one who is enthusiastic on Palestine of " Holy Land on the brain," any

one less prejudiced than these critics will admit the x^ass to be a magnifi-

cent one, and the situation of Kerak to be majestic.

It has already been described by Irby and Mangles, and is sufficiently
          GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLORATION Of MOAB.                          223

known to students. The entrance to Kerak is certainly unique, by an arclied

natural tunnel in the side of a precipitous cliff, out of which the traveller

emerges in the midst of the city. The photograph shows this gateway into

Kerak. It is needless to describe the extraordinary position of the city and

its natural and artificial strength against the resources of medioeval or modern

Oriental assault. It was undoubtedly the strongest natural fortress in Syria

--before the introduction of modern artillery a platform of a triangular shape,

each side from | to | mile in extent, inacessible except by exposed mountain-
paths on all sides, save where a neck of land connects it with the adjoining

mountains, and this cut through by a wide fosse of 30 feet deep and touch-

ing massive walls 18 feet thick above it.

The fortifications, Phoenician or Jewish in their lower parts, then Roman,

surmounted by the work of Crusaders, are of vast extent and cnoi-mous

height. The photographs give some idea of the vast labour expended on

these works.

  We found Kerak as little hospitable as have our predecessors in this land.

The Mudjilli, though holding a Turkish commission, is practically indepen-

Wedent, and is an unscriipulous, avaricious, and cunning chieftain.  were

held as prisoners for some days to ransom, after entering under his son's

safe conduct ; but our imprisonment was not severe, though rather costly.

   On one day, when our keeper relented, we were able to go out with a

guard, and ride many miles to survey, while the rest of the party photo-

graphed nearer home.

Our survey proved very successful in fixing the sites of many ruined places,

some of them hitherto unknown by name, and the others erroneously placed

in all the existing maps. Our course lay chiefly south for twelve miles, and

thence back by a detour to the eastward. Crossing the deep valley of Tziatin,

where the soldiers of Ibrahim Pasha were slaughtered in 1844 in attempting

to cut their way from the north, we marked the position of Jelam es Sebbha,

where Ibrahim Pasha had his camp ; and then of Kureitin (evidently an

ancient Kiriathain), the remains of twin ancient towns close together, each

on a low knoll. This fashion of two adjacent towns with the same name

seems to have been very prevalent throughout the whole of Moab.

Here we foiind ourselves on the high tableland which forms the country of

--Moab, studded thickly in every direction with ruined villages and towns,

always situated on gentle swellings Kirbet Azizeh, Kirbet Nekad, M'hheileh,

Howeiych, Jubah (on the old Roman road), Mahkhennah (mentioned by

Irby), Modeh, Abou Taleb, Mesh'had, and several others. Modeh, like
Kureitin, has been a twin city, and there is a Roman milestone, iinmutilated,

close to it, of the date of Antonino. At none of these ruins did we find any

water, but wells and cisterns innumerable, from fiftj' to one hundred in each

place, generally one for each house, and oil-presses and wine-presses cut in

Wethe rocky slopes.   returned by Madin, more extensive ruins than the

others. Here were sarcophagi and sculptured fragments, and house-walls

saw, but did not visit, the ruins of Moureyah, Hamad, Suhl, and Nachal,

mentioned by Ivhj.

From the Kerak people wc obtained a long list of names of ruined sites

known to them, upwards of sixty in number, some of which seem the Arabic
representatives of Hebrew names. Dimnah (perhaps the Dimon of Isaiah,

commonly held to be identical with Dibon), Lubcirali, Sumrah, Yaroud,

Retir, Hadadah, Rahun, Zerar, Hhomoud, Azour, and others.

able to leave Kerak without the payment of a very heavy ransom (^70 in
all), and started for the north.

   It must be remembered that Kerak is the one inhabited place in the whole
country, the only town or village in the vast and once densely peopled
region between Es Salt in Gilead and Shobek, a little villnge in the ancient
Edom.

    Passing the ruins of Suweiniyeh and Duweineh, after descending from

Kerak, and ascending again more than 1000 feet, we rode through the ruins
of llakim and Mikhersit, from which place we followed the liomau road
to the ancient llabbath Moab, now Kabba. These are some of the most
extensive and finest ruins in Moab ; but the incessant rain prevented our

taking any successful photographs. We camped inside an immense Eoman

tank, GO yards by 50, and, though filled to a considerable extent with the
refuse of the goats which are herded there, still nearly 30 feet deep.

   The city seems to have been a square, more than a mile each way. One
fine temple has some columns and two arches left ; but all else are only broken
walls, with long lines of straight narrow streets and countless vaults arched
over. The ruins are Eoman, but with many carved stones from earlier edifices
built in, and many dressed blocks of basalt, telling of a still more ancient city.
There are several greeu mounds covering extensive masses of masonry, which
might probably repay excavation.

   Prom Rabba we followed the Roman road northward, passing a very perfect
little Roman temple, one and a half mile from the city, and soon afterwards
a ruined town (the remains of which seem anterior to the Roman occupation),
Missdehh, and immediately afterwards Humcitah, the Hammat or "Animah"
of Palmer, probably an ancient Ham.

   Kasr Rabbah, or Beit el Kurm (the house of the vineyards), four miles

north of Rabbah, has possessed a magnificent Corinthian temple ; the diameter

of the columns, many of which with the frieze are standing, is 4 feet 8 inches.
Hence the Roman road divides, one line going towards 8hihau, the other,

more easterly, to the passage of the Arnon. The former crosses the gentle

depression which marks the commencement of the Wady Ghurweh. An

easy slope reaches to the top of Jebel Shihan, on the southern side of which,

lining the Roman road, are very singular remains, countless small enclosures,

fields or gardens, all formed of blocks of basalt, undressed, and no limestone

employed; they cover many acres. The road here has been only 15 feet
wide. The city itself, on the top of the hiU, has been built chiefly of limestone,
with very little basalt. The cisterns are numerous and of considerable depth
but they, as well as the wells, are now all dry.

   Descending by N.E. we passed through the ruins of Balh'ua, and overtook
the rest of our party, who had followed the other route. Near the edge of
the ravine of the Arnon are the remains of an old fortress, Kirbet Sum'hra,

and then Muhatet el Haj, conjectured to be the Jahaz of Scripture, shape-

less ruins.

   The passage of the Arnon has been described by several of our predecessors,
who have certainly not exaggerated its magnificence or their fatigues. By
our barometers the depth is 2150 feet, and the southern plateau is 200 feet

higher than that to the north. The Roman paved way may be frequently
traced, as weU as the remains of the bridge below. From crest to crest,
we computed by triangulation to be about three miles. The upper part of

tbe southern side reveals a superficial basaltic stream, which is absent on the

north. There are numerous ruined forts all along the Roman causeway. On

the northern brow, a mile cast of the road, arc the ruins of Arar, the ancient
                      GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLOHATIOX OF MOAB,  227

Arocr ; and " the city that is in the midst of the river " (Josh. xiii. 16) is no

doubt indicatorl ])}· the remains iu the luxuriant strip of scmitropical verdure

that fringes the Arnou far below it.

   Here, from the news of a sad domestic affliction, brought to us at Eabbah
by a messenger who had been beaten and robbed of the letters by the scouts of

the Kerak ruffians, Mr. Klein, to whose aid we are really indebted for the

success of our expedition, through his masterly knowledge of the language

and his friendship with the Eeni tSakkr, was compelled to leave us and return

hastily to Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Dr. Ginsburg.
   From the northern crest of the Arnon bank a good view could be obtained

of the general lie of the Wadys which here furrow the high land.
   The Arnou, or Wady Mojib, is formed a little above where we crossed it

by the junction of three ravines of nearly equal height, the northern one

named by Zadam Wady Seideh, the name given iu all the maps to the central

one, and the others Mdkhauas and Balhua.

  A ride of three miles across a dreary highland plain brought us to Dhibau,

another double city on two knolls, whose caverns, cisterns, underground store-

houses, and semicircular arches present no peculiar features. To the west of

both knoUsis a little stream, near which the famed monolith was found, and

in which water was running. All the surrounding hiUs are limestone, and

there is no basalt excejit what has been brought here by man. It is need-
less to say that no inscribed remains now exist above ground ; but we found

a very finely dressed basaltic oil-press, with the upper stone lying close to

the outer cylinder, by the bank of tlie stream.

Prom Dibon we struck eastwai'd, by the route taken by Messrs. Palmer

Umand Drake, towards       Rasas. The road lay up a wide depression, wliich"

could scarcely be called a valley, known as Kurm Dhibau (the vineyards of

Dibon), and continuously for three miles were the traces of the vineyard-
ridges across the slopes. These are " the plains of the vineyards " of Judges

xi. 33, the route taken by the Amorites after their discomfiture by Jephthah.

llujum JSclim, a shapeless inconspicuous heap, is the ouly ruin on the way

Vmfrom Dibon to       liasas. This latter seems placed too far east by Palmer,

who has also erroneously marked the Hadj road as touching it, and placed

--it ten miles too far west a mistake not to be wondered at when we con-

sider the very great difficulties under which Mr. Palmer and Mr. Drake

accomplished their visit.

A UmEoman road does, however, touch   Easas from Heshbon to the south.

Um Easas was of necessity very hastily examined by our only predecessors,

and is of much greater extent than had been imagined. The outline of

--the city and its walls, appai-ently repaired at a later period, is perfect, no

grass-grown mounds, but simply fallen or falUng buildings, with streets

encumbered bj' the masonry and countless arches ; no heathen temples

within the city, but five Christian churches, one of them probably a cathedral,

and all of the Basilica type. The apse was generally perfect, with the

plinth and beading decorated by bosses carved with alternate heads and crosses.

Some of them we photographed. Outside where we were camped was the
amphitheatre, now grass-groM'n, and several very deep cisterns, not very

large superficially.

The most interesting ruin here is a Christian mortuary tower, which Mr.

Palmer has sketched, close to the ruins of a Byzantine church, of which we

took photographs. This tower is a landmark for miles round, and ludicrous

traditions are locally attached to it.

  Um Easas appears to me to be probably the " Thamatha " of the ' Notitio,'
                                                                      b3

the station of the first Valeutian " Ala ;" and the name is preserved in the Wady

Thamcd close by. It certainly must have been one of the most important
cities in these highlands in the Eoman times, and is on the Eoman military

road.

We made expeditions eastwards to the ruined fort M'scitbeh, where there

was abundant water in a large cistern, and the Hadj road eleven miles east

of it, cast of which is the ruined Khan Zebib, which places have never before

been visited. Khan Zebib is e\ndently built on the ruins and with the

debris of a former great city ; and to the east of it are the remains of an

Uminteresting Doric temple. Jemail (two and a half miles south of  Easas)

and Ghazal (Khazaleh of Palmer's map) were also visited. At both of them

there was water, and traces of vineyards in the neighbourhood. Khan

Zebib is above the rise of the Wady Shabelc, the head feeder of the Zerka

Main or Callirrhoe, a wide shallow basin fed by the drainage from a lime-

stone range to the east of it.

   The Hadj road is here closely marked by about fifty parallel furrows,
formed by the tread of loug lines of camels pursuing the same tract for

ages in succession.

   Near the great temple east of Khan Zebib are numerous natural caverns,

which form subterranean labj'rinths, and have been cemented and used as

reservoirs in past ages : now they seem occasionally employed as hiding-
places and folds by the Bedouins. Beyond these are a number of artificial

mounds and circles of stones, affording unquestionable evidence of the cairns

of the primaeval inhabitants.

We Umspent several days at     Easas, in the hope of securing a stone which

is buried there, but which the Bedouins would not reveal to us, I have

seen a squeeze of this stone, which is now in the possession of Dr. Dodge,

of Beirut, having been taken by a Bedouin before the stone was buried

it is of basalt, and bilingual. The centre is occupied by a sei'pent biting

a scorpion. On the serpent are inscribed numerous Phoenician characters,
and on one side is a long inscription of many lines in the Phoenician cha-

racter ; on the other, arranged in a similar semicircular fashion, one in
apparently Nabathean letters. I hope ere loug to obtain a copy of this

important inscription.

UmFrom  Easas we travelled N.AV., passing Beihar and the ruins called

Draa, a Moabite city of the very oldest type, probably the Zoas of Eusebius,
and the seat of a bishopric. This place has not been previously noticed, and
solves some of the difficulties which have encumbered the topography of the

Zoas of the Pentateuch,

   In two hours we crossed the Wady Thamed, overhanging which, on a

peninsula formed by the river, is an immense heap of stones, apparently an

old keep and enclosure. It is 300 feet above the Wady, and is known as

Um WeE'mail.  made this our station for a few days. Three miles north

of it is Zafaran, with a fort of large squared stones on the top of a till, and
the remains of the town below it. There are no traces of arches here, and

the place seems pre-Eoman. It may perhaps be the Naar Safari of the

' Notitia,' the station of the second Ala miliarensis. Near it are the similar

ruins of El Alaki, and two miles further El Herri, a fortress on a knoll and

JV town below it, with the old Eoman road passing close by.

UmThe next ruin, N.E. from hence, is  Weleed, one of the most important

and extensive in the whole country. The ruins are of three distinct types,

pre-Eoman, Eoman, and a Saracenic Khan. No previous traveller has visited it,

and its local name gives no clue to its ancient name. The Eoman road passed
                    GEOGRAPHICAL EXPLOKATION OF JIOAB.             229

through it. Tlierc is an amphitlicatrc ; the pavement of a forum, surrounded
by the bases of cohimus, is entire, 41 paces by 38, and just beyond it tlie

eastern gate of the city, outside which is an interesting little Doric temple,

12 yards by 10, facing east, the niches being still in sitti.

The streets here have been arcaded ; and we found iu some places the flat

slabs of stone which formed the flooring of the dwellings above the streets

still entire. By the side of these old streets the ancient Khan looked but a

work of yesterday.

Um UmWe followed the Eoman road from                           el Kuseir. There

across part of the plain, built for the purpose of guiding the ffoods into the

Umcisterns.    el Kuseir is of the same type as the last named city, but not

so extensive.

Hence we struck eastward to Ziza, where we spent a week. It is men-

tioned in the ' N'otitia' as the headquartc}-s of the Dalmatian Illyrican cavalry.

The remains of Ziza are very perfect. The tank is simply magnificent, 140
yards by 110 (see Photograph); many of the stones are G feet in length.

Much engineering ingenuity is shown in the mode by which the upper valley

has been banked, and a system of sluice-gates arranged for filling the pool

and letting off the superfluous rainfall.

Above it is a strong Saracenic fort, still entire, and which was occupied by

Ibrahim Pasha. Tiie upper story has been fitted for engines of war, and

many stones taken from Christian chambers marked with plain symbols appear

in the walls. The ancient city is on a long ridge further up, occupying

several acres, and full of sculptured ruins. The whole hill is honeycombed

Avith cisterns. The principal remains seem not earlier than the Christian

period, comprising several churches.

Sis miles east of Ziza we crossed the Hadj road, not far from the base of

the limestone range which forms the eastern limit of the highlands of Moab.

  A little beyond this, at the very base of the hiUs, but without any trace

of water, we discovered a palace which surpasses in interest any other of the

niins which this expedition has brought to light. Prom the eminences near

Ziza we had detected a pile of masonry in this direction ; the Beni Sakkr gave
it the name of Mashita, and spoke of it as being like the other ruinous

heaps which we were continually examining.

  A gazelle had beguiled our ride, and not a little were we startled when

we reined iu our horses in front of a facade of which only the photographs

can give the slightest idea. Two days were well spent in photographing and
measuring (see Plan and Photographs). We were in utter perplexity as to

the origin of these magnificent buildings ; nor was our difficulty lessened by

the long lines of inscriptions in an unrecognized character on the lower coriieri

outside the inner palace. One thing was plain, the palace had never been

finished, at least in its decorations ; and we have to thank Mr. Fergusson for

having given us the clue to the solution of the problem. Mr. Fergusson is

decidedly of opinion that it is the work of Chosroes II., the Sassanian king

of Persia, after his conquest of Syria, jS'orth Arabia, and Egypt in a.d. 611-

622. The builders seem to have been interrupted, for it is evident that the

decorations were never finished. This is explained by the advance of the

Emperor Ileraclius, who so brilliantlj- swept the Persian out of the whole of

his conquests, and recalled for a moment the glories of old Home.

There are no more ancient remains of any kind in the neighbourhood,

and no Saracenic additions whatever. Mashita stands forth in absolute

solitude and isolation; unlike the cities of Moab, with their traces of many
230 KEPORT-- 1872.

epochs. It probably was erected as a hunting-palace, to gratify the luxurious

taste of Chosroes. Mr. Fergusson has pointed out the indications in this

wonderful sculptured facade of Byzantine art, guided by Persian design

(see Plan and Photograph).

It is not a little strange that so perfect and unique a building has remained

unnoticed and undiscovered by any European before us, and without any

tradition attaching to it by the Bedouin. There is no trace here of any de-

struction by the hand of man. The sculpture is of extraordinary depth and
scarcely weathered, as may be seen by the photographs.

   Travelling north from Ziza, the ruins of Kustul, evidently some Eoman
" castellum," possess, as may be seen from the photographs, a character distinct

from any other Moabite cities. There are the several walls, cisterns, and

arches, these latter unusually massive and well finished ; but besides them
two castles, with many semicircular bastions, surmounted by a sculptured

balustrade of the Corinthian order. The principal castle is 84 yards square.

The smaller castle, isolated from the city, would seem to have been a temple

Wefortified.  found a Greek altar of white marble, and several marble capi-

tals, which must have been imported from the Greek islands or Asia Minor.

Below the city is a tank like that of Ziza.

Six miles north of Kustul I visited Thenib, a heap of cisterns, walls, and

arches, and two miles further north Eujum Hamam, a ruined heap of shape-

less stones. This was our extreme north-eastern point.

UmTravelling west from Kustul,  Zibarah presents only a large assembly

of hummocks and hollowed cisterns. Crossing the commencement of Wady

Jifar we reached the top of Jebel Jelul, a most remarkable hill, hitherto

unnoticed, or placed close to Heshbou, rising 300 feet above the plain and

covered with ruins. Pieces of Doric entablature were strewn about. The

panorama from Jelul was uninterrupted for several miles in all directions.

   From Jelul, turning south, we passed Sufa, crossed Wady Habis, the ruina

of Betan el Bareil, Habis city, and then leaving the highlands followed down

the gorge of the Habis, the main feeder of the Zerka Main. Owing to the

ruggedness of the road it was a two days' journey to the hot springs of Cal-

WeUrrhoe.     had now left the country of the Beni Sakkr, and were in that

of the Hamaydeh. These latter have been spoken of as an independent tribe,

Weand the remains of the ancient Moabites.   never found them inhabiting

huts, but only tents like other Bedouins physically they seemed decidedly
                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

inferior to the Beni Sakkr, who treat them as mere vassals, pasturing their

cattle and camels where they please in Hamaydeh territory, and summoning

them to their service. They obeyed the orders of Zadam implicitly, when

he desired Ibn Tarif or any other of their Sheikhs to act as our guides in any

part of their country. ISTor were we once asked for backshish from the time
we left the Kerak men till we reached Jericho. Their chief men never pre-

sumed to enter the tent with Zadam, but consorted with the servants. The

Wegorge of the CaEirrhoe is one of the grandest I have seen.  had to ascend

to a narrow secondary plateau and then descend 1300 feet to the hot baths.

The north face of the ravine is red sandstone below and white limestone

above; the south face is formed by a stream of basalt, in many places co-

lumnar.

Our camping-ground was delicious, by the side of a warm sulphur torrent,

9G° Fahr. just where it dashes into the cooler stream of sweet water in front

of us. The hot sul^jhurous springs aU issue from the north face of the gorge,

at the jiinction of the red sandstone with the limestone. In a reach of three

miles there are ten principal springs and many minor ones, dashing down
GEOGRAPHICAL KXPLOHATION 01' MOAB.                    231

little nullah's or canons, all shaded -with date-palms and canebrake. The
temperature of the upper spring was only 85°, that of the fifth and tenth,
which are the largest, was 135° and 14U° at their exit from the rock. The

heated stream of the Calhrrhoe retains a temperature of 70° at its mouth.

   There is not a trace of Roman baths or of building of any kind ; this ig
not to be wondered at when wo observe the rapid deposit of sulphur uoW

forming about all the lower springs. These sulphurous deposits form crum-

bhng cliffs, under which the hot stream has in many places made itself a

tunnel, to which the Arabs have pierced holes through the overlying crust,

over which tlicy sit and enjoy a natural vapour-bath.

  We made this lovely glen our hcadcpiarters for eight days, and thoroughly

examined the neighbourhood. The castle of lEachterus (M'Kaur), the place of
the martj-rdom of St. John Baptist, does not seem to have been noted by any

predecessor, and is wrongly placed in the maps. It stands to the S.E. of

the head of the Wady Sgara, the next glen to the south of Callirrhoe. Its

natural position is accurately described by Josephus ; but there is nothing left

to give any idea of the great strength of its fortifications. The citadel, isolated,

as Pliny observes, from the city below, has only foundations of the keep just

level with the soil, circular, exactly 100 yards in diameter; within it is a weU

of great depth, a large and deep oblong cemented cistern, and two dungeons,
one of them very perfect. The town occupied the ridge of a long crest running
east and west to the west of the fortress, and is marked by a stupendous heap of

stones, beyond which are the foundations of several forts and of a smaU temple.
The stone heap is 250 yards long and of great height, and the crest is 3800
feet above the Dead Sea. The finest "saew on the east side is, I think, from

the top of the ridge between M'Kaur and Callirrhoe.
   Attarus, the ancient Ataroth, and Kureiyat (Kiriathaim) were also visited.

Attarus is certainly in extent among the most considerable of the Moabite
ruins, but featureless ; Jebel Attarus is three miles distant from the site which
bears the name of ancient Ataroth. It has been crowned by a massive square

fortress. The feature most remarkable in this treeless country is a fine tere-
binth, Avhich attracts the eye from far and is noticed by Eurkhardt. Eound
this hill and in the undulating plain between it and the city the ground is
sparsely covered with trees, the only wooded spot in the highlands. Tere-
binths, oaks, and especially the almond-tree in abundance, present an aspect

most refreshing in this bare and monotonous land.
   Kureiyat has nothing worthy of note, and from hence to the Anion there

is scarcely a ruin on the eastern edge of the plateau.

   In the neighbourhood of the Calhrrhoe we observed several prehistoric
stone circles, like those found at Beitin and elsewhere, and many cairns, which

seem far anterior to the mounds of the cities.

   An expedition to Zara (the Zareth Shaphau of the Bible) was full of interest.
The narrow ravine of the Callirrhoe it was impossible to follow ; and we were

compelled to mount the heights, cross two more gorges, and follow the crests

till we descended 2000 feet from a lower plateau upon the oasis of Zara.

Tills is not, as marked on the maps, at the mouth of the Callirrhoe, but consi-

derably to the south. It was a city of Eeuben, its frontier town on the

Weshore, and shows few traces of later occupation.  may trace the features

of the Jewish town, a central fort on a knoll and the houses clustering round
Weit, as may be seen to-day at Gibeon and elsewhere.
                                                      were surprised to

find a wide extent of rich land fringing the Dead Sea, abundantly watered

by hot springs, some sulphurous and others sweet. This belt reaches to
within a short distance of the mouth of the Arnou. Northwards some bold

headlands intervene between it and the Callirrhoe, and a scramble ^ye had to'
g&et ronnd to the fissnrc tbrong'h which the river emerges, forming a spit

covered with tamarisk at its entrance. It is needless to say that we found
the shore-line laid down by Lynch most accurate, but the sketching-in of the

country, even close to the water's edge, most inaccurate, as his party in this
district seem rarely to have left their boats. There is a striking contrast
between the eastern and western shores ; on the latter there are only a few
patches of verdure, scarcely breaking the desolate barrenness of the coast-line
on the east all is exuberant verdure and continually running streamlets to
the water's edge. The palm-tree is abundant, and clings to the sides of the
little ravine from a height of over 1000 feet to the very edge of the sea (sec
Photograph), while the varying shrubs and flowers overpower the botanist.
This must be attributed to the sandstone formation, which, underlying the
eocene deposits, nowhere appears on the west, while it is greatly elevated on

the eastern side.

   Arrived at the mouth of the Callirrhoe, we ascended the gorge on foot with
an ibex-hunter for our guide, and though the scrambling was severe, were
richly rewarded. At the shore the cliffs are 600 feet high, and the opening
only 100 yards across, sometimes^ as we ascend, only 30 yards. It winds and

turns suddenly, and the glow of the red sandstone walls is gorgeous. Paths

or tracts of course there are none ; and we were compelled to climb as best we
could up the side, Avhen a waterfall, Jebel Moia, i. c. " waterhill," barred all

 progress.

    After having thoroughly investigated this district we turned northwards,

visiting at leisure the sites on the western edge of the highlands where the

cities of Moab were most crowded.
    In this region, as far as Heshbou, I must notice the great number of dol-

mens which everywhere occur in these parts, which are too rocky to have
been ever subjected to the plough ; I have counted more than twenty in one
morning's ride. They are all of one pattern, three stones placed endwise
forming three sides of a square, and a large stone forming the cover, generally

about six feet in diameter. I never found four sui)porting stones.

   We followed a road, Jewish or Pv,oman, to Maon and then to Medeba. On

every side are the foundations that mark the boundary-walls of fields or vine-
yards, while the Belka Arabs here, for the first time, exemplify the natural
fertility of the country by their cultivation of large tracts in wheat and

barley.

   For the ruins of Main (Boal Meon), which occupy four adjacent hiUs, and
of Medeba, which retains its Bible name unchanged^ I can but refer to our

photographs.

   At the latter we camped for some days and visited the ruins to the east
and north. Medeba contains more perfect lloman remains than any of the

other western cities of the highlands. It is not in a hollow, but, like all

other towns of Moab, on the top of a knoll. The forum, or whatever else it

may have been, is the largest we have seen, 280 by 240 yards, with a colon-
nade, and the bases of the columns still in situ, many temples and later

christian churches. The most remarkable remaining work is the reservoir,
built on the same principles as Solomon's pools, and 120 yards square, with
its walls 30 feet thick at the base, tapering to 18 feet. It would be tedious to
describe the temples and churches of Medeba, which at least prove the dense
population of this part. The other northern cities of Moab call for no special

mention ; they occur every half mile, and are alike in their main features. Man

has had little or nothing to do with their decay. "We examined carefully the

affords exactly the view described iu Deuteronomy, and I can find no other to

rival it. The city of Nebbeli is lo-\ver down on a spur of the range, and with

Wedown the shore of the Dead Sea towards Callirrhoe.                                                        ascertained that

the Seisaban, the ancient plains of Shittim, is of very much greater extent

than the maps represent. The fertile Ghor extends from the Beit Nemeirah,

or iipper fords, to within 3 miles of the mouth of the Callirrhoe, and is well

watered throughout ; but in ancient warfare this region could never be

defended, and the ruins are unimportant, though there is not a single mound

without the stones which tell of some fort of the olden time.

   Nous ne nous sommos occiipes jusqu'ici de la formation des equations anx

   Considerons maintenant par exemple une fonction ?t de .r, y, z, en la
definissant par ces trois equations, ou entrent detix parametres a, /3, et un
nombre quelconque n de fonctions arbitraires A, B. . . . L, de ces para-

   Report on the Discovery of Fossils in certain remote parts of the

             North-western Highlands. By William Jolly.

A LIMESTONE Tuus from Durness and Loch Eribol, in the north of Sutherland,

with varying thickness but more or less continuity south by Loch More.Inchua-
damph, Ullapool, and Loch Maree, to Kishorn near Loch Carron, Avhere it dies
out on the mainland. This limestone rests on a thick deposit of quartzite,
and this again on the red sandstone of the west coast. All of these rocks
enter into some of the grandest scenery of the North-western Highlands.

   These rocks were considered unfossiHferous tiU 1855, when Mr. Peach
made his great discovery of those fossils in the Durness limestone which
were classed by Mr. Salter as Silurian, and the discovery of which enabled Sir
Er. Murchisou to complete his classification of tlie rocks of the N.W. of Scot-
O^ FOSSILS FROM THE NORTH-WESTERN HIGHLAXDS.                            23^

land. These fossils were discovered ia the limestone of Durness, where they

are numerous, and where more have since then been found. This Durness

limestone forms, geographically, an isolated basin lying to the west of the

great strike of limestone which runs from Eribol to 8kye. In this detached

deposit only have fossils been found, with the rarest exceptions, to be named

below. It is important, therefore, that organic remains should be found, if

such exist, in the great line of strike, in order to determine whether this

last limestone is fossiliferous or not, and also -whether the Durness lime was

deposited under the same or under different conditions. It was for the

purpose of making diligent search along this great line of deposit, that a

grant was asked and obtained last year from the Association ; as also for the
discovery of more perfect specimens, and, if possible, new species, from the

Durness lime, in order to determine more precisely the relations these fossils

bear to the Silurian and other systems, than could be made from the sped

mens submitted to Mr. Salter in 1S58.

Since the Edinburgh Meeting last year, search has been instituted along

this great strike of limestone at Durness, Loch Eribol, Inchnadamph,

Elphin, and Kinlochewe, and Avill be made at Ullapool and Loch Kishorn.

At these points, certain clergymen, teachers, and other gentlemen have kindly

consented to do what they can towards the discovery of fossils, so that more

systematic search will now be made than heretofore. Good results may be

anticipated, if not in the discovery of fossils, at least in greater certainty as

to the presence or absence of organic remains in these remarkable rocks.

   At DuKNPiss, in July of last year, many fine fossils were obtained, through

the efforts of some members of the Committee and their friends, from a re-

markable island of limestone near Cape Wrath, called Elian Garve. These

fossils were shown at the Meeting in Edinburgh, and were pronounced by

Mr. Poach much finer than any he had seen from the same locality. They

Ahave been secured as the nucleus of a collection for the Association.  col-

lection of fine specimens was also made by a student resident in the district,
for Professor Nicol, of Aberdeen, who now has them in his possession. This

island is so difficult of access, except in the very calmest weather, that we

were unable to land both this year and last. In June of this year, along

with some friends, I landed on a rocky headland of limestone, on the west side

of the Kyle of Durness, where fossils are exposed on the weathered surfaces

of the limestone in remarkable numbers, and I obtained some good speci-

mens. Several gentlemen in the neighbourhood have kindly agreed to make

diligent search in the Durness limestone at various points, and one of them

has also kindly allowed the use of his boat for this purpose ; so that good

work will be done at the least possible expense.

 --Loch Eribol. No fossils have yet been discovered in the extensive lime-

stone rocks on Loch Eribol. An Orthoceratite was presented to the Jermyn-

Street Museum by Sir II. Murchison, which he got from Mr. Clark, of Eribol

House. This Orthoceratite is unique, as being the only organism found in

the quartzite. It was not, however, found in situ, nor at the spot marked

by Sir Iloderick in his paper in the 'Geological Journal' of August 1860,

vol. xvi., but was picked up in a detached piece of rock between Eribol

House and the loch to the west. Lime-works have been established on Loch

Eribol on the limestone peninsiila of Heilim, and quarrying has been done

in connexion with these, but as yet no fossils have been found. These ope-

rations afford an unwonted opportunity for their discovery, and the strictest

watch is to be kept by the lessee.

 --iNCHNADAMPn, In the immense development of limestone at the head of
 240 REPORT--1872.

 Locli Assynt no fossil has yet been discovered, except two by Mr. Peach iu
 the stinking limestone above the manse near Inchnadamph. One of these
 was an Orthoceratite. I sjDcnt some time on this limestone this year,

 but was unsuccessful, except in finding a piece that may turn out to be
 organic. Mr. Peach's discovery shows that fossils may be found here ; and
 the parish teacher is to make search during next year.

    Elphin is situated, not far from the splendid limestone-cliff of Craig-an-
 Knockan, figured by both Murchison and Nicol ia their papers on these rocks.
 Here the limestone is largely developed, and has been quarried at various
 points. The teacher of the Society school is to look for fossils.

    Near Ullapool, on Loch Broom, there has been a good deal of quarrying

for lime-burning, and the sections arc extensive. Something may be dis-

 covered there. Search will be made.

    At Ktnlocheave, at the head of Loch Maree, there is not so much lime-
stone exposed as in other parts. The Free Church teacher there is to devote
his spare time to a search ; but much cannot be looked for, as the limestone

is in contact with igneous rocks, in Glen Logan, where it is found.
    At Locn KisuouN there is a large exposure of limestone along the loch

near Courthill. This will be submitted to careful search.

    In this way the whole line of strike of this limestone from N. to S. will be
examined by intelligent men, who have kindly and earnestly entered into the
work, and we consider ourselves fortunate in having secured such cooperation.
The Committee confidently hope that by next Meeting they will be en-

abled to present to the Association a good collection of organic remains from
these interesting rocks ; or, at least, to have done something that will contri-
bute to greater certainty as to whether, and to what extent, these rocks are

fossiliferous or not.

Report of the Committee on Earthquakes in Scotland. The Committee

   consists of Br. Buyce, F.G.S., Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S., D. Milne-

    Home, F.R.S.E., and J. Bkough.

As Convener of the Committee -on Earthquakes in Scotland, I have to report
that the last year has passed without any incident coming within the scope
of this inquiry ; there has not occurred any sensible disturbance in the

Comrie district, or oscillation of the lakes in the neighbourhood, such as
those recorded in former Reports. In other parts of Scotland the same
freedom from earthquake-movements has prevailed. But this state of
quiescence is not likely to continue ; and the attention of the Committee
has been turned to the remedying of those defects which from time to
time are apt to occur with instruments long in use, and to the extension
of the means of observing to other localities suitably placed for the pur-
pose. The accomplishment of this object renders necessary some more simple
means of noting shocks than any which have hitherto been applied by the

Committee. The seismometer belonging to the Association, which now

occupies the tower of the parish church of Comrie, is of too complex con-

struction, and takes up too much room, to be applicable except in a few
peculiar localities. Some simple and cheap method of indicating earthquake-
movements is thus much to be desired. Any apparatus for the purpose

should occupy small space, be little liable to derangement, capable of being

put up in any ordinary apartment not of special construction, and its indica-

tions such as any intelligent person could easily interpret and readily note.

The Committee are now anxiously considering what instrumental means

will best combine these several requisites and advantages, and what stations

would be most suitable to select in extending the area of the inquiry. Mean-

while the seismometer of the Association, which is the invention of the late

Principal Forbes, is kept in proper working order at Comrie, where also the first

supplemental indicator will be set up. Principal Forbes's son, Mr. Geo. Forbes,

Edinburgh, who has gained some practical acquaintance with earthquake in-

struments at Naples, has been taken into their counsels by the Committee, and

they have now to request that Mr. Forbes be added to their number.

Fourth Rejjort of the Committee appointed to investigate the Structure
   of Carboniferous-Litnestone Corals. The Committee consists of
   James Thomson, F.G.S., and Professor Harkness, F.R.S.

At the Liverpool Meeting of the British Association the Committee reported
that they hoped, by means of a new process, to produce representations of

the most delicate internal structures of corals of the Carboniferous series.

The necessity of such a process forced itself on the Committee by the circum-

stance that none of the existing methods of representing corals reproduced

faithfully the details of their internal structure.

The photographs of the Carboniferous corals exhibited at the Liverpool

Meeting represented these details in some of their most delicate forms.

This result had been obtained by the transmission of light through their

sections ; and subsequent investigations have led us to infer that there are
no better means than that of photography for reproducing generic details.

Great expense, however, attends this process ; and as it is also a very slow
one, experiments have been made in order that the same satisfactory result

might be more readily and less expensively obtained.
   At the Edinburgh Meeting they were unable to lay before Section C the

same number of results as at the previous Meeting ; but they had so far

succeeded as to be able to produce two plates, although they were not so

perfect as was desirable : they were, however, sufficiently successful to

justify the Committee in asserting that a more simple and less expensive

process was available. In the application of this process the Committee
have been ably assisted by Mr. Keckie, the artist employed by them in

engraving the copper-plates.

   During the past year the investigations of the Committee have been con-

tinued with increasing interest. They have now made sections of upwards
of 1300 specimens, and have been able to add considerably to this branch of

Palaeontology.

   In their Eeport presented to the Liverpool Meeting ninety-two forms were

alluded to ; and these presented characters sufficiently distinct to justify thy

242 REPORT--1872.

Committee in adding them to those previously described by MM. Milne-Edwards

and Jules Haime. By this addition, the number of British Carboniferous

corals amounts to 156 species.

   From the forms which have been recently sliced, and also from those of

former years, the Committee have ascertained that among these species from

300 to 400 varieties occur, an increase which is so great, and the variations
so minute, that it becomes difficult to determine specific characters among

these corals.

   The gradations of the varieties are in some cases so constant, and pass

so imperceptibly into each other, that they induce the inference that there

has been an inherent tendency in the polyp to vary independent of, but to

be modified by, the conditions of its surroimdiugs.

The forms occurring in deposits which have resulted from deep water are

not only more symmetrical in outline, but also more perfect in their internal

structure than such as are met with in strata formed in shallow water,

where they have been exposed to the constant shiftiiigs and abrading influence

of shore deposits.

In the case of such forms as occur in a matrix originally in the state of

fine mud, these are small in size ; and they seem to have been gradually
exterminated by the impurity of the water, arising from the increase of the

fine sedimentary matter originally held in suspension.

   Many of the specimens which have been sliced are found to be perfectly

useless from their imperfect state of fossilization. Some reveal structural

characters not previously noticed by authors in this branch of Palseontology

it is desirable that these should be studied further before a complete classi-

fication of this group of animal life is attempted.

The classification of corals has in some instances been based upon external

aspects ; in others on the number and form of the septa. The number
and arrangement of the lamellfe which pass from the inner margin of the

primary septa and fill up the columeUarian space have also been adopted as

bases of classification.

Some writers regard the form and position of the dissepiments of the

endotheca as of specific importance ; and some rest generic and specific

distinctions upon the presence or absence of the columellarian line which

passes from the inferior to the superior, and terminates in the centre of the

calice. Observations, however, justify us in inferring that, although these

several characters are of importance, they cannot be depended upon for

specific determinations.

   During the last fifteen years no less than 10,000 specimens have been

sliced, many of which show structural diff'erences" in character from such as

have been accepted as of specific importance, which induce us to conclude

that further examinations are necessary before determining even a variety.

    It has been stated that the columellarian line has been accepted as of

generic value. In a new group of corals, which will form the subject of

an extensive memoir, this line is developed, in some instances, near the

inferior, and in others it occurs only in the superior portion of the coral.

The dissepiments filling up the interseptal space are in some forms angular,

Wein others subangular and. rectangular.  have, however, recognized these

several outlines in the sa^e form, and cannot, therefore, accept the outline

of the dissepiments as of specific importance.

   In the case of the number of lamelke also, some forms present the lamellae

in one part, while in another part of the same coral the space is filled up

by tubulsB.
           ON CLAIMS FOR REWARD FOR ADOPTED INVENTIONS ETC. 243

   Concerning the number of the septa, this can hardly be regarded as of
value, since this number is dependent on age and surrounding conditions
during the growth of the polyp.

   In order that some definite rule may be obtained as a guide in the classi-

fication of corals, it is proposed to select generic types, and, after making
sections of these through different jjarts, to exhibit their structure in plates,
from the ova to their mature forms ; and it is only when this is faithfully
done that we can hope to determine where a sjjecies begins and a variety ends.

  We have, in conclusion, to thank the British Association and many kind

friends for the assistance rendered us, and hope for its continuance until this

laborious but interesting investigation be completed, as we are satisfied that

results will be obtained commensurate with the time and expense which the
work has cost during the last fifteen years.

  A sum considerably in excess of the grant having been expended, the

Committee have to ask that a further grant of £25 be placed at their disposal

for continuing the investigation.

Report of the Committee, consisting of J. F. Bateman, C.E., F.R.S.,

   P. Le Neve Foster, M.A., C. W. Merripield, F.R.S., E. Easton,
   F.G.S., F. J. Bramwell, C.E., W. Hope, V.C, and H. Bauerman,

   F.G.S., appointed to consider' the mode in ivhich new Inventions and

    Claims for Reivard in respect of adopted Inventions are examined
   and dealt with by the different Departments of Government, and to
   report on the best means of removing any real causes of dissatisfac-
   tion, as tvell as of silencing unfounded complaints.

Having regard to the evidence taken by the Committee of the House of

Commons on the subject of the Patent Laws, in 1871 and 1872, on the rela-

tions between inventors and the Government, as well as to complaints made

in Parliament and elsewhere, your Committee were of opinion that they had

before them sufiicient information " as to the mode in which new inventions,

and claims for reward in respect of adopted inventions, are examined and

dealt with by the difierent departments of Government." They therefore

did not think it necessary or desirable to examine witnesses on the subject.

The Committee considered it fully established that the present methodical

mode of dealing with inventions submitted to the different departments of

Government was uncertain and unsatisfactory in itself, frequently unjust to

inventors, and generally detrimental to the public administration. They

considered it established to their satisfaction, that real injustice was

frequently done to inventors, not only by neglect and procrastination in

dealing with their claims, but also by the undue preference of other con-

flicting claims urged by officers of the different departments. Without enter-

ing into the merits of any cases in point, it appeared beyond doubt that the

practical judges of the inventions have been very often rival inventors within

the departments. The Committee considered it obvious that this placed both

the inventor and departmental officers in a false position, and that the con-

sequent decisions could be satisfactory to nobody. As matter of evidence,

they considered that these departmental decisions had failed to give satisfac-

tion either to inventors or to the public.

REPORT 1873.

   It remained for the Committee to consider and report on the best means
of removing " any real causes of dissatisfaction, as well as of silencing un-
founded complaints."

   The Committee are of opinion that the primary means of effecting this

object is to bring the adjudication of these claims within a jurisdiction inde-

pendent of the administration of departments of the public service. As long

as the Patent Law remains as at present, the Committee are of opinion that

the only satisfactory method of determining what compensation should be
given to inventors, in cases where the Government makes use of their inven-

tions, is to have recourse to arbitration. Any inventor whose patented in-

vention is used, or believed to be used, by any Government official, or agent
under Government authority, should be at liberty to apply to the proper
Government department, stating what is the invention used, and how and
where, and requesting that the application be referred to the decision of two

arbitrators, who shall be appointed, one by the applicant and one by the

Government department, with power to appoint an umpire, and that the
proceedings be assimilated to ordinary compensation cases.

   The Committee, hoping that the recommendations of the House of Commons
Committee will, at an earl}^ period, be made the subject of legislation,
recommend that steps be taken, by petition to Her Majesty or otherwise, to
make the grant of Royal Letters Patent for inventions of effect as regards the
servants and officers of the Crown in the same way, and to the same extent,
as Letters Patent are of effect as regards all others of Her Majesty's siibjects.

   Your Committee feel that, if in evciy ease officials appointed to investigate
new inventions were required to affix their signatures to their reports,, very
beneficial results would follow, as the personal responsibility thiis attaching to
them would ensure their full attention, and deter them from rejecting hastily,
or on insufficient grounds, anj^ proposition or invention brought before them.

   The Committee consider that their Report would be incomplete if they did
not call attention to an Act for preserving secrecy in the case of inventions
connected with warfare.

   This Act is the 22nd Vic, cap. 13. Its principal provisions are :

   Section 1. Improvements in instruments or munitions of war may be

assigned by inventors to Secretary of State for War.

   Section 2. Foregoing enactment may extend to assignments already made.
   Section 3. Secretary of State for War may certify to Commissioners of

Patents that the invention should be kept secret.

   Section 4. Where he so certifies, petition for letters patent to be left with

Clerk of Patents, under seal of Secretary of State.
    Section 5. Such packet to be kept sealed.
    Section 6. To be delivered on demand to Secretary of State or Lord

Chancellor.

    Section 7. At expiration of patent to be delivered to Secretary of State.
    Section 8. Where Secretary of State certifies after filing of petition, docu-
ments already filed to be put into sealed packet.
    Section 9. Copy not to be sent to Scotland or Ireland, nor published, but

otherwise provisions of Patent Acts to apply.

   Section 10. No scire facias to be brought.
    Section 11. Secretary of State may waive benefit of Act.

    Section 12. Communication of invention to Secretary of State not to pre-

judice letters patent.
OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.  245

 Report of the Committee for discussing Observations of Lunar Objects

   W.suspected of Change. The Committee consists of the Rev. T.

    Webb, the Rev. Robert Hakley, F.R.S., and Edward Crossley,

      Secretary.

·The Committee have pleasure in presenting their Second Eeport on the above
 subject. It will be remembered that the Report of last year was confined

 principally to the discussion of the possible variations of visibility of the

 numerous spots and craterlets upon the floor of Plato under the same condi-

 tions of illumination. That now presented is directed chiefly to the discus-

 sion of the various streaks aud bright patches which interlace the spots and

 craterlets.

  --One interesting and important change ha^ been fairly shown the floor of

 Plato becomes darker with the increase of the sun's altitude. Mr. Birt has
 suggested an explanation of this phenomenon. Whatever be the true cause
 of this change, it is very dijBficult to account for it by the ordinary laws of

 reflection. ^Yhen we consider the varying aspect of the streaks at the same
 time of the luni-solar day, we cannot but think that, with careftil observations
 made with powerful instruments, such as the Newall Refractor and many
 others, we may be able to confirm or otherwise a physical explanation of

 these curious changes involving the existence of certain gases aud vapours

 upon the surface of the moon.
    The Committee can only look upon the study of Lunar Physics as in its

 infancy, and they trust that in future years the Association will not overlook

 this important branch of astronomical inquiry.

     Eeport on the Discussion of Observations of Streaks on the Surface of the

                          Lunar Crater Plato. By "W. R. Birt.

    In completing the task assigned to me of discussing the observations of the

 streaks on the floor of Plato, I have been desirous of including every, eVen
 the most minute, circumstance bearing on the exhibition of phenomena that

 may possibly illustrate the condition of a small portion of the moon's surface
 at the epoch 1869 April to 1871 April. Drawing my conclusions from the
 experience of twelve years, I feel that I may confidently say it will be some

 years before another series of observations of a particular region will be
 undertaken with the view of so closely examining the spots and streaks cha-
 racterizing it, unless a staff of eflicieut observers be organized with the pro-
 vision of a fund sufficiently ample to defray all the necessary expenses. The
 work is a difficult one. The staff should consist of not less than six devoted

 observers, who would, independently and most probably, as in the present
 case, work with instruments of varying aperture and carefully record all
 their observations. The principal qualification is a keen eye for the apprecia-

 tion of delicate variations of tint, and the detection of minute spots of light
 with a readiness of referring them by estimation and ahgnment to the respec-
 tive localities of the region on which they are seen. The observations should
 not be allowed to accumulate, but should be forwarded at once to an experi-
 enced selenographer charged with the work of arranging and discussing them.
 Taking into consideration the results of the discussion of the present and
 previous years embodied in the two Reports, it appears that in order to con-

 firm these results, and to open up new investigations in other regions of the

 moon's surface, the requisite time cannot well be fixed at less than three

--years five would most probably afford the best results.
                                                               --

246 REPORT--1872.

The results of the present work may be briefly characterized as confirming,

by a direct reference to the sun's altitude above the horizon of Plato, the sup-

position that variations of tint in some measure depend on increasing and

decreasing altitudes. The ascending and descending branches of the curve

obtained from independent estimations of tint by the several observers are

sufficiently near those of the sun's altitude to enable me to delineate a nor-^

mal curve representative of the sun's influence in darkening the floor of Plato,

or else in overspreading it vrith something of the nature of a dark covering, as

his rays strike the surface at the increased angle of about 40 degrees. While

this darkening influence comes out most unmistakably, there are variations

in the lighter and darker portions of the floor which seem quite irreconcHe-

able with solar influence of a gradual character. The treatment of the obser-

vations under intervals of the luni-solar day fails to bring out any regularity

in these variations, and it is only by treating the observations clironologicaUy

that the true sequence of the changes can be detected. To do this for every

separate streak woiild not only swell this Report to an unseemly length, but

woiild consume more time than can be devoted to the inquiry. I have,

nevertheless, considered separatelj'' the changes which were observed in

August 1869; and in order to assist in showing more distinctly these changes

and their connexion inter se, I have introduced the hypothesis of a dark

obscuring medium. Not that I lay any stress upon a mere hypothesis of this

kind ; it serves to connect the observations, and that is all ; it may or it
may not be true, and should therefore be held very lightly. In addition to

this examination of the distribiition of the light and dark spaces on the floor,

I have traced from day to day the appearances of a single streak, that desig-

nated a, from its flrst detection in September 1869 to the close of the obser-

vations; and to show more conclusively that the variations manifested by this

and neighbouring streaks were not dependent upon the same solar influences

which contributed to the darkening of the floor, I have arranged all the ob-

servations bearing upon them in the order of intervals of the luni-solar day.

--The principal divisions of the present Report are: 1, the influence of the sun

on the floor of Plato ; 2, an examination of changes recorded in August

1869                           3, the history  of  streak a ;  and  4,  observers' notes arranged in
                            ;

intervals of the luni-solar day, and embodying generally the results of the

two years' observations.

It may contribute to a better understanding of the nature of the streaks,

their connexion with, the spots, and their variability, if the physical charac-

Weteristics of Plato be described.                 have : First, a mountain-cinctured plain,

of about sixty miles in diameter, the wall rising to the average height of

nearly 4000 Enghsh feet. This waU is surmounted at four points by needle-

like pinnacles of rock, which rise to a further elevation of 3000 feet, so that
their summits attain the height of about 7000 feet above the plain, which is

not strictly level, the border having suffered from dislocation, which has

raised the floor in a direction from S.E. to N.W. Second, two systems of
streaks, as seen between April 1869 and April 1871, They are related to the
" fault " produced by dislocation. The S.W. system consists of the " trident,"

the N.E. of the streaks 0, ij, and y (see fig. 1). These two systems, which
are opposite in direction, are intimately connected with certain spots in their

respective neighbourhoods, the S.W. radiating from spot No. 1. Of the N.E.

system, streak /3 emanates from spot No. 3, r] from spot No. 4, and y from
spot No. 6. The most prominent streak on the floor is the sector which takes

its rise from spot No. 4, but has occasionally been seen in the opposite direc-

tion, extending as far as spot No. 3. The S.E. portion, that extending to the
                                                                                                                                         ;

    S.E. border from spot No. 4, has, under very favourable circumstances, been

   The above enumeration has been drawn up with an especial view to the
connexion existing between the spots and streaks. There are a few points
worth notice, particulariy as regards the streaks : one is, their appearing
brightest nearest the border of Plato ; another, assuming that they have
                                                                --

OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAE OBJECTS.                                                                      249

their origin in spots, that they extend from higher  to  lower  ground                              and  a
                                                                                                 ;

third, their sharp and definite character on some occasions contrasted -with

--their extreme delicacy on others. Mr. Pratt, under date of November 9,

1869, wrote as follows : " As far as I can remember, I have always forgotten

to say how delicate the chief parts of the trident are ; they are most delicate."

In the Observers' Notes (seepost, pp. 272 to 298) there are numerous instances

recorded of the difficulty of detecting the stem and arms of the trident in the

neighbourhood of spot No. 1, and often of their complete disappearance. On

the other hand, observers frequently speak of the sharp definition of certain

streaks. As regards the connexion between the spots and streaks, in the

case of the largest spot, No. 1, which is situated on the highest part of the

floor, it appears highly probable that the three arms and stem of the trident

are connected with it much in the same way as streams of lava are connected

with the volcanic orifice from which they issue ; the varying intensity of

brightness of the arms is greatly in accordance with the supposition of their

being the results of intermittent emanations from an orifice of this kind, of

which the cone is spot No 1. The spot ranking next to No. 1 is No. 4,

which appears to be of almost the same character as No. 1, the main differ-

ence being its frequent hazy appearance, which on some occasions is very

marked. Prom this spot three distinct streams appear to issue : First, the

sector, which is usually seen to spread out from it in a fan-shape ; very rarely

the fan of brightness has been seen striped, as if the slope from spot No. 4 to

the S.E. border were furrowed. Generally the brightness extends as far as

the border, where three spots have been (although rarely) seen; and on one

occasion a dark space, as if occasioned by a cloud, covered them. Second,

the streak »/, extending to the N.E. border : this streak very frequently

exhibits, in common with the arms of the trident, a fading of the portion

between the cone and the border, so that the portion near the border is

usually the brightest. Third, a streak mentioned only as an extension of

the sector from spot No. 4 to spot No. 3 ; it is not often seen. The disposi-

tion of the three streams indicates very probably the channels in which any

ejecta may have descended from the orifice, and in which such ejecta may

have so accumulated as to have produced the appearance of "spurs" noticed

by Mr. Pratt (see Report Brit. Assoc. 1871, p. 95). On either side N.W. and

S.E. of spot No. 4 are the spots Nos. 3 and 6. The three are situated upon

the N.E. slope from the " fault," and from No. 3 (which, by the way, is a

group of three openings) issues the streak /3, and from No. 6 the streak y.

The near parallelism of the streaks /3, rj, and y results most probably from

the positions which the spots from which they issue occupy on the sloping

ground.

   The north-west part of the floor offers a very decided contrast to every
other portion, characterized, as it has been during the two years, by consider-

able alternations of brightness, as well as alterations in the forms of the
streaks found upon it. The connexion between the spots and streaks, to

which attention has been directed, is well marked ; but here in the N.W. area
it is difficult to detect such a connexion, if it exists. The principal spots are
Nos. 13, 19, and 16 ; and these lie in the principal streak of the district, and
do not appear as orifices from which distinct streaks issue. In whatever the

peculiarity of this portion of Plato consists, it is one that shoidd be most
assiduously watched and every phenomenon witnessed on it most carefuUy

recorded.

   The observations had proceeded with great care during a period of more
than twelve months, when a new streak made its appearance between spots

Nos. 5 and 14. Some months afterwards a continuation of this streak east-

ward of No. 5 was observed, and very lately it has been seen between Wos.

A14 and 22 {p, fig. 1, on p. 247).  very remarkable characteristic of this

streak is its parallelism with the south border. Taking all the circumstances

of the observations into account, it can scarcely be doubted that this is a neiv

streak, the eastern and western portions being connected with spot No. 5,

and the further continuation westward with spot No. 22.

   If it should be well established that new streaks make their appearance
from time to time, we may be able to understand that many recorded differ-
ences from the older delineations are to be referred not so much to errors of

the earlier selonographers, as to real changes in the

objects themselves ; for example, this very area of

Plato is figured by Beer and Madler, in the first

edition of the large map, as being crossed from N. to S.

hj four light streaks, as in the annexed sketch, fig. 2.

That Madler actually saw these four streaks there can

be little doubt, as they are distinctly mentioned in

' Der Mond.' That they are not in existence at present

is quite certain; for the disposition of the streaks is noWp,  -Beer and Madler.

                      Inflttence or the Sun on the Floor op Plato.

    Previous to an examination of certain non-periodic changes of brightness,
colour, and the forms of streaks, it is essential to ascertain the normal varia-
tions of tint as dependent upon the gradual increase and decrease of the sun's
altitude before and after the sun's meridian passage. This has been ascer-

branch, and also as the floor becomes darker as the sun ascends higher,
an ordinary light tint has been fixed at 0-33, and a dark tint at 0-66 ; very
light and very light indeed have been registered i)rovisionally lower than
0-33, and very dark and very dark indeed higher than 0-66, so as to give a
range, as regards Plato, of 1-00. The actnal range resultiug from 133 obser-
vations in two years is 0-41, and the range of solar altitude at the equinoxes
on the parallel of 50° is 40°. The chromatic range very nearly coincides
with that of altitude, and the connexion between the tint of the floor and
the effect either of light or heat is plain and unmistakable. The floor
must therefore consist of material capable of becoming darker by exposure

to light and heat, or it must possess a covering that may possibly be affected

in the same way. The inflexions of the chromatic curve indicate rather
considerable variability, especially in the deepening of the tint, which
hardly accords with a permanent surface being heated by definite and
regular increments of heat : and it would also appear that the solar effect is

not fully attained ; for although the ranges of both curves are very nearly

equal, a mean chromatic curve drawn with a free hand would indicate an
average liffhter floor than that which a regular heating might be expected to

produce. So far as the writer is aware, this is the first attempt to indicate
numerically the chromatic effect of light or heat, or both, upon the moon's

surface. It has long been known that the grey plains appear darkest under a

high sun, but the knowledge of the nature of the progression has been vague
and undefined. It is greatly to be desired that other spots, especially in

lower latitudes, should be observed in the same way ; but some time must
necessarily elapse before observations of them could be compared with those

of Plato.

                                                                            II.

             An Examination of Changes recorded in August 1869.

    These changes were recorded in four carefully executed drawings of the
floor of Plato by Mr. Pratt. They exhibit, first, a rapid alteration of the
distribution of the light and dark portions of the floor between the 16th and
17th of August, and a more gradual but slight, yet still perceptible, change
from the 17th to the 28th. Calling the figures in their order 4, 5, 6, and 7,
and starting with the assumption that the permanent colour of the floor is

light (see Section on the influence of the sun on the floor of Plato), we may

 trace the changes between each of the observations, remarking at the outset
that the spots are presumed to be permanent as to their positions on the

 floor.

 . Fig. 4, August 16, 1869, exhibits a disposition of the darker shading
 entirely detached from the border on every side. The shape is roughly that of

--aW, the western leg being the widest, with spots Nos. 14, 1, and 19 just on

 its border ; the dark space forming the middle leg extending from beyond
 No. 17 to beyond No. 3, both spots being involved in it; and the eastern
 leg very near the east border, having spot No. 6 on its western edge. Seven
 spots are given on the drawing, viz. Nos. 14, 1, 6, and 19, just on the border
 of the darker portion, Nos. 3 and 17 in its midst, and No. 4 on the Light

 portion.

     Theorizing merely as a help to connect and interpret the phenomena
 observed, and assuming that the lighter tint is that of the floor and the dark
 tint that of a something which varies in position, the nature of which we
 have yet to learn, we have in fig. 4 its disposition on August 16, 1869. Of

--the shading of the floor on this day Mr. Pratt thus writes : " This was more
252 REPORT 1872.

curious than I had seen it before, and totally different from my former

sketches."

 --Fig. 5, August 17, 1869. In this figure we see a very considerable exten-

sion of the dark portion of the floor, the spot No. 6 still marking the position

Wof the western edge of the eastern leg of the of the 16th. On the 17th we

find this leg had extended quite to the eastern border ; indeed the whole of
the northern boundary of the dark portion had become extended to the N.,

N.W., and W. border ; at the same time the opening between the eastern

and middle legs unveiling the lighter floor (?) had become extended, so as to
include spots Nos. 3 and 19, and to exhibit (?) spot No. 13. If this were so,
it could only have been eff"ected by a separation of the darker substance,
whatever it was, which, spreading outwards towards the border of Plato, pro-
duced the difierent configuration observed on the 17th. This opening from
the S.W. part of the floor to the east border and sector was seen by Mr.
Gledhill on September 25, 1869 (see post, p. 295, and fig. 9, p. 263).

   In the southern part of the floor we have another opening, apparently in

the neighbourhood of spot No. 1, which joined the opening effected in the

northern part at its western end, the N.W. arm of trident e ; and, simultane-

ously with this opening, the dark substance near spot No. 3 overspread a
portion of the opening between the western and middle legs, by which the
stem and north-western arm of the trident was produced.

    That part of the darker portion just S.W. of spot No. 1 must have under-
gone the greatest change in its disposition, inasmuch as not only was an
opening made from No. 1 to beyond No. 14, but the substance itself must
have increased ; for there can be no doubt that the area covered by the darker
portion on the 17th exceeded that covered on the 16th. The effect of this
extension was the production of the S.E. and middle arms of the trident, or,
at least, the rendering of them apparent as compared with the 16th.

    Looking at the position of spot No. 1 in connexion with the three arms of
the trident, can it be possible that emanations from this crater tended to
preserve the radiating openings marked by the figure so well observed from
the 17th to the 28th inclusive?

  --In reference to August 17, Mr. Pratt has the following remarks : " This

[the floor] was very remarkable : resolved to give it especial attention, and,
after some application, succeeded in adding piece to piece till a sketch was
                    OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.                                              253

completed, very strange in comparison with last night's sketch. Its form,
complicated as it was, was very carefully traced in the drawing, and repeat-
edly seen afterwards, but so delicate that it was impossible to see the whole
at once. It required to be traced out by minute attention." Compare Mr.
Pratt's drawings (figs. 5, 6, and 7) with Mr. Gledhill's of September 25 (fig.

9, jposi,. p. 263).

   In comparing Mr. Pratt's sketches of August 16 and 17, the transition in

the 25 hours is very remarkable ; indeed so much so as to indicate that some

extraordinary change had come over the floor in the interim : the disposition

of light and dark is almost entirely diff'erent, yet I think I can trace the

effect of " action " on the floor. On the 16th the lighter portion affected the
border, the darker portion being entirely separated from it. The northern

boundary of the dark portion took the form of the streak c and k, which was

plainly seen on the 17th, with a dark portion on its north. Had the streak

c and K a motion southward from the north border between the two observa-

tions? Again, on the 17th, e, the N.W. arm of the trident, was not sepa-

rated from c. It would appear that the markings, as seen on the 17th, were
evolved, from the peculiar and remarkable disposition of the light and dark

portions seen on the 16th. It will be seen further on that, as the observa-

tions proceeded, the light portion was not unfrequently noticed to be in con-

--tact with the north border.
   1869, August 20. Mr. Gledhill described the floor as darker than the

surface of any of the i¥arja=0-99 ; the sector faint and all spots faint. On

--the same day Mr. Pratt thus graphically describes his seeings: "The

shading on the floor of Plato is quite a study, and a perplexing one ; some-

times, when the air is disturbed, a light sector (S.E. part), like Mr. Birt's

key-plan, is alone visible. Again, in a few minutes two streaks from Anaxa-

goras  would  seem  to  cross the floor, as sketch  May 22,   1869                       then,  again,
                                                                                      ;

between the two, a third narrower streak appeared, similar to Webb's copy in

' Celestial Objects ; ' and as definition improved, a light marking near the north

rim {k) was seen ; and again a change, and the appearance is decidedly the

same as on the 17th of August, a near approach to Mr. Knott's sketch.

" These different appearances were reobserved, in all their curious dis-

Bolving-view-hke changes, several times over, thus beautifully showing the

harmony that may possibly exist between the most dissimilar observations,

and strongly suggestive (to my own mind) that the form of the shading on

the floor is permanent, and that the various degrees of visibility of its more

--difiicult features is owing to the relative changes in the medium through

which we see it whether of the earth's atmosphere alone, or of an obscuring

medium on the floor itself, must be determined by comparison with similar

and simidtaneous observations in different parts of the world. Thus within

two hours I several times saw four greatly differing aspects of the shading on

-- mythe floor, viz. B. & M.'s, Mr. Birt's, Mr. Knott's, and  own."

1869, August 21. Mr. Gledhill recorded the tint of floor as dark as that

gathering up of the dark portion still in progress, although to a very small
extent as compared with the "action" of the 16th to 17th. The northern

light portion was seen separated from the N.W. arm of the trident, and an

opening made from spot No. 6 to the S.E, border, apparently by the action

--of the spot. Some additional spots were seen on the 23rd viz. No. 5 on the

west border of the S.E. arm of the trident, No. 22 on the N.W. arm, No. 16

on the northern opening, and No. 7 near the east border.

--254 REPORT 1872,

   On this day (August 23) Mr. Gledhill described the bounding lines of the
light sector, when produced, as cutting two craters outside and above Plato,

--and the sector itself as "faint, but luminous and well seen." Mr. Pratt's

record is as follows : " The floor was seen as on the 20th inst., similar to
Mr. Knott's ; other markings of a more complicated character were very

strongly suspected. The trident-shaped marking a little more slender and

elongated N.E. and S.W. than in my sketch of the 20th inst., probably an

--error in drawing its first appearance. On this drawing I have the following

remark : ' N.W. arm of trident separated from curved streak by a narrow

--neck of dark surface. The stem as on the 17th.'
    1869, August 25. Mr. Gledhill described the floor as " not so dark as the

upper part of Grimaldi."

  --1869, August 26. Mr. Pratt writes : " Shading on floor visible, precisely
--as in sketch of the 23rd of August, 1869 viz. the long streak from the N.W.

round by N. and crossing S.E., with the ray I towards the middle of II E * '^,

and the trident- shaped marking on the S.W. part of the floor, with the

--streak [stem of trident, cZ] extending halfway from spot No. 1 to No. 4."
    1869, August 27. Mr. Gledhill described the light sector as a very faint
object. Spot No. 3 easily seen double, and the floor but little darker than

the Mare Imbrium.

  -- --1869, August 28. Mr. Pratt's record is as follows : " The shading of

the floor was seen as on the 23rd of August, with the addition of the apparent
continuation of the streak {d) from spot No. 1 to spot No. 4, and a curved
streak commencing abruptly at the shadow of the rock Rupes Smythii (B.

& M.'s ^), not sketched, and continued towards spot No. 3, and joining the

streak along the north side of the floor." These features are exhibited in

fig. 7 ; the opening forming the stem of the trident is seen extending as far

as the " Sector," and a new opening, apparently a continuation of the northern

opening, extending north of spot No. 7 towards the east border.
    The hypothesis suggested as an explanation of the variations depicted in

Mr. Pratt's drawings recognizes the darker portion of the floor as possessing
an obscuring character, and subject to changes which do not aff'ect the lighter.
Although looking at this hypothesis, as set forth in the above remarks, as
explaining the variations observed by Mr. Pratt, yet it is difficult to divine
the nature of the darker portion, as it appears to absorb light rather than

reflect it. It is noteworthy that it is the darker portion of the floor that
                                                                                                                                                             ;

varies its tint to the greatest extent. Tliere are further phenomena which

require explanation ; neither the light nor the dark tints are seen at sunrise

or sunset, but a greenish tint characterizes the floor at those times. It is

when the sun attains an altitude of 30° that both the light and dark tints
appear ; and it has been especially noted that when the craterlets assume

the appearance of white spots, the sun is usually about 30° high. All the

phenomena hitherto observed on Plato, except the variations in the visibility

of the spots, and, it may be, in the visibility of the streaks also, depend upon

solar influence.

   In order to guide future inquiry, it may probably be useful to present an

enunciation of the principal features of the hypothesis employed in explain-
ing the above-recorded variations as bearing upon the lighter and darker

markings of lunar plains generally.
   The hypothesis is based upon the Icnoiun properties of gases and their

affections by heat. Being weU acqiiainted with phenomena, the proximate
causes of which are understood, we may proceed to the study of other pheno-
mena of which the loci are inaccessible to us, but which, being hnotvable,
we may also, by observation and induction, become acquainted with their

causes.

  We Jcnoiu that the effect of heat on all bodies whatever is to vaporize them,
Weand this vaporization proceeds at all temperatures, low as well as high.

also know that vapours behave as permanent gases, are diffused through

them, are elastic like them, and are expanded as they are by successive in-

Wecrements of heat.                                  further l-now that vapours of even solid substances

attain a state of maximum density in given volumes of gases dependent upon

temperature ; and our hnowledge extends a step further, viz. that when the

temperature of a given volume of gas is diminished below the point of

maximum density of any particular vapour, the superabundant vapour is

condensed and cloud or dew are formed, and this alike of metallic as well as

of liquid substances. Now, bearing in mind these four results cognizant by

--us, the conclusion seems to be irresistible, (1) that the sun shining on the
moon's surface must vaporize the materials of which it is

the vapours thus raised from the surface must be dissimilar, inasmuch as

the different reflective powers of different parts of the surface indicate the

existence                             of  different  materials  composing  the  surface                             (3) that the different

vapours resting on the solid surface act upon each other and upon the ma-

terials of the surface itself, so that diffusion takes place, and maximum den-

sities are attained as the temperature both of the surface and of the vapours

increase                              (4) that the expansibility of the    vapours  raised                          above  the                               surface

by the accumulated heat of at least 177 hours of uninterrupted sunshine

must produce ascensional currents of the liberated vapours, carrying them

into colder regions, where condensation occurs, and cloud or mist is formed

(.5) that the attraction of gravitation acting on the condensed vapours caiises
them to descend into warmer regions, where they are dissolved ; and as the

temperature declines less vapour is raised, and the features of the surface

become unobscured.

  A very pertinent question may here be asked. Is this hypothesis capable

of substantiation, or, upon examination, is it likely to be found destitute of

proof? In rej)ly it may be asked. Do the darker markings, which appear to

be formed some time after sunrise upon the floor of Plato, partake of the

nature of clouds ? and are these clouds perforated and separated by elastic
vapours rising from a surface heated by an exposure to sunlight of 48 hours

or more, in consequence of which its reflective powers become stronger, pro-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                :

ducing the lower lighter surface ? The difficulty in this supposition is the
dark upper surfaces of the hypothetical clouds. If we can find a vapour
which, when illuminated by the sun, appears darker than the ordinary sur-
face of a cloud of condensed aqueous vapour in sunlight (which, by the way,
shines with about the same luminous intensity as the moon's surface), we
shall be in a fair way of explaining the difficulty. The green colour which
is witnessed at sunrise and sunset is probably the natural colour of the floor
of Plato, which, under the accumulated heat of the solar rays, reflects a
lighter tint ; at the same time the condensed vapour overspreads the lighter
floor below, giving rise to the appearances we witness.

   In applying this hypothesis to the explanation of the phenomena presented
by Linne, it is necessary to remark that we have a shallow basin surround-
ing a cone. The earliest appearance is that of the cone standing out from
the dark surface around, the next of a white spot, more or less of a cloudy
character, surrounding and hiding the cone. If the above-enunciated hypo-

--thesis be correct, it would explain the Linne phenomena thus at sunrise

the features are well marked, as neither a liberation of gas nor its condensa-
tion has taken place : as the sun's altitude increases, the surface around
Linne becomes heated, reflects more light, and a spot is formed at the same
time in the lower levels ; the condensation of liberated vapour not far above
the surface produces the generally observed dark appearance of the Mare,

obscuring on many occasions spots and craters. The remarkable instance
of the contraction of the white spot around Linne in June 18G7 may be

explained by the condensed vapour rising higher, so as to leave a smaller
area of the upper part of the cone visible ; or if it were at an elevation equal
to about the summit of the cone of Linne, a partial cessation of the liberation
of elastic vapour would allow it to gather around the cone, to be dispersed
by a further eruption of vapour or gas from the orifice of the cone.

  --On the 22nd of September, 1871, I received a letter from Mr. Elger, in

which he says : "Your letter of the 18th, relating to the markings on the

floor of Plato, has greatly interested me, inasmuch as you therein suggest a
theory to account for the remarkable appearances observed, which seems to

me to be well worth careful consideration. Doubtless the sun's heat during

the long lunar day must cause vaporization on the moon's surface, and sub-
sequent condensation of the various vapours raised follows as a matter of

course. So far we have a vera causa which would account for a great deal,
if we could only show that the vaj)ours raised are sufficiently dense to produce
VISIBLE effects : it is highly probable that they are so, or, at all events, we
may suppose that the varying visibility of such delicate objects as the spots
on the floor of Plato is, to a certain extent, accounted for in this way ; but I
would submit that, in the case of the markings, it is difficult (if the dark

 spaces between the markings are the upper surfaces of masses of vapour
 hovering over the floor, and of course varying in altitude from hour to hour)
to account for the fact, that since the year 1866 the light streaks have

altered so little in shape and position. It seems to me that if they were

 merely openings in the dense vapour, they would not only vary in position
 from lunation to lunation, but changes would take place from hour to hour,
 which could hardly be overlooked by observers with powerful instruments
Linne is a case in point. The observation of June 1867 is in perfect har-

mony with your theory ; indeed the phenomena presented by this remark-

 able formation are, I think, quite inexplicable, except by supposing agencies
 of the kind suggested by j^ou to be in operation. At some future time,
 when selenography is more advanced, it will probably be found that all

olijects on the Maria aud low-li/ing tracts are more or less variable iu

visibUifcy."

   In reference to Mr. Elger's remarks, an important question may bo sug-
gested. Is the moon surrounded by an atmosphere of elastic gas ? This

question has been answered in the negative, inasmuch as in the phenomena

of occultations no distortion or bending of the rays of light from the stars
occulted has been noticed. If I remember rightly, this is the basis of the
negation : Mr, (now Sir "W. E.) Grove, in his address to the members of the
British Association at Nottingham in 1866, alluded to the unsolved state of
the question ; and, " supposing the moon to be coustituted of similar materials
to the earth, it must be," he said, " doubtful if there is oxygen enough to
oxidize the metals of which she is composed ; * * * and it might be a fair

subject of inquiry whether, if there be any coating of oxide, it may not be

so thin as not to disguise the form of the congealed metallic masses, as they

may have set in cooling fx'om igneous fusion." The presence of oxygen, in-

ferred from oxidation, presupposes an atmosphere of permanently elastic gas

or gases. From the investigations of Herr Althaus, it has been approxi-

mately estimated that the moon's hemisphere turned towards the earth

attains at least a maximum temperature of 840° of Fahrenheit, upon the

assumption that the moon's power of absorbing heat is equal to that of quartz.
The heat thus attained would very closely approximate to the temperature
at which iron appears red in twilight, and exceeds the fusing-points of tin and

--lead. On the other hand, the minimum is estimated to be 92° of Fahren-

heit, which would give a fall of about 940° in fifteen days ; this Avould be
equivalent to daily increments and decrements of heat of about 63° each.
This enormous variation must be attended with very considerable expansion
and contraction of the gases, either present or liberated, and a very rapid

diminution of temperature upward must result. Now about the period of
maximum temperature of the luni-solar day the surface, whatever materials
may compose it, must be in a very different condition to what it existed in at

sunrise ; and this is so far visible to us by the different aspects of objects
under high illumination, so graphically described by Webb, and also by the

intensely glowing luminous spots, such as Aristarchus, Censorinus, Dionysius,
and various streaks under a midday sun. If the heat exceeds the melting-

points of tin and lead, it is quite possible that, long before the maximum tem-
perature is attained, substances may be fused and vapours given off which,
rising quickly to a cooler region, may be condensed and become visible to us

as cloud.

As regards the streaks on Plato, it has been proved by observation that

the  floor is  irregular,  although it  generally appears to  bo smooth  and even
                                                                                                                  ;

it is known in some places to rise slightly above a mean level and to sink in

others slightly below ; and this depressed character is most prominent at the
interior foot of the surrounding mountain-ring. The principal craterlet is

situated upon the highest part of the floor, and from it radiate the arms and

stem of the " trident." It is not at all unlikely that the great heat to which

the surface is subject may at times produce eruptions from this and other

craterlets ; indeed we appear to possess evidence that this has actually taken

place at least twice within the period of the observations ; and the arms, as

wcU as the sector and great northern streak, may owe their existence to such

eruptions, which of course would give them a permanent character. Sub-

jected to the intense cold of the lunar night, at sunrise they would only

reflect the same amount of light as the other portions of the floor ; but as the

floor becomes unequally heated; some portions absorbing heat while others

reflect more liglit, they -would stand out as luminous streaks and markings,

to be partially or' wholly obscui'ed by any condensed vapour which may
happen to be floating above them. An absence of condensed vapour would

impart to the floor a sharpness and definiteness so often observed, by the aid
of which very minute objects are easily seen, while even a slight film, ana-
logous to our cirrostratus cloud, would impart a mistiness by which the more

--delicate spots and streaks would be obscured, the broader features still re-

maining visible a state of things of which evidence exists in the observations,

and which has been observed more or less since the time of Ilevelius, who
relates that " several times he found, in skies perfectly clear, when even stars

of the sixth and seventh magnitudes were visible, that at the same altitude
of the moon, the same elongation from the earth, and with one and the same
telescope the moon and its maculas did not appear equally lucid, clear, and

conspicuous at all times, but were much brighter and more distinct at some

times than at others."

"Webb suggests that there is more inequality than we have yet studied in

the reflective power of diff"erent substances at different augles of illumination

or incident light. " It may be," he says, " that different colours behave
differently when treated in this way ; and I suspect they do : ccj., if from the

surfaces of certain materials the capacity for reflection of blue rays should
increase more rapidly than that for red, then with increasing angle of illumi-
nation the colour of the object would slightly change, and with it its propor-
tional visibility at a distance where colour becomes impercejitible. * * * Is
it not possible that other circumscribed regions in the moon, e. cj. that

glorious Archimedes, might show variations in the markings even more defi-
nite and considerably more easily dealt with than those in Plato? The
curiously but occasionaUij speckled and streaky aspect of the Mare Crisium,

as described by Schroter, E. & M., and others, would be a grand case were
it not so rare. If we could only find some smaller and more easily studied

surface, equally or more frequently varied, it would be a great matter. But
is there not something of a more general character underlying, as it were,
these special instances that has never yet been properly investigated ? "We
lay it down, as if it were unquestionable, that local colour in the moon is
masked in the rising and setting illumination, and comes out under high

angles when the shadows disappear. It may be so ; but why ? If I took a

piece of plaster of Paris, moulded it into all sorts of hollows and knobs, and
painted it harlequin fashion, then the colouring would be all equally visible,
whether under oblique or vertical illumination; or, to make it more like the
moon, if the artificial surface were only shaded with brownish or bluish greys

we should have the same effect ; as long as there was light enough to show
it, the distinction of colour would remain. On the moon it is fiir less evi-
dent, and frequently quite imperceptible. Now what imderlies this ? "^'hy
do certain very dark spots on the moon come out under high illumination,
or certain brilliant specks, being much less if at all contrasted with the
neighbourhood when near the terminator? Could we produce an artificial
surface which would behave in the same way? 11 /'?/ should this difference
(whatever may be its cause) depend, not on the angle of incidence, but on

that of reflection ; for the full-moon aspect extends over the whole disk, not-

withstanding the low illumination of the regions all round the limb, many of
which show spots as vivid or as deep as more central regions? No one, so

 far as I know, has touched at all on this very interesting point."

irregular surface painted with clifFfrent colours presenting an equally diversi-

fied appearance, -whether the incident light were oblique or vertical, and

the distinction of colour remaining so long as sutHcient light existed to sho-w

it, I would remark that there can be no doubt that the moon's surface is as

much variegated with colour as the earth's, but by distance the distinction

of colour is softened down to tones of grey, in the same manner as wc are

able to distinguish nothing but greys in a distant terrestrial landscape. It is

the telescope which brings out the distant red-brick building or the dazzling

whiteness of the church steeple under a noonday sun, the predominant

colour of the landscape being either the delicate green of spring, the deeper

green verging on blackness in summer, or the rich reds, browns, or yellows

of autumn. These are the colours which characterize the foliated covering of

the earth, interspersed with a sandy or even white tint indicative of the ex-

istence of vast desert tracts. At the distance of the moon we only perceive

on her surface various tints, from a dark blackish grey to a dazzling white

and these are certainly intensified under vertical illumination, but most

decidedly under that reflecting angle the value of which is measured by the

supplement of the difference of longitude of the moon and sun when it is

equal to zero, or supplement d -0=0°. Perhaps the following experiment

may set this matter in a clearer Ught. Take an ordinary cream-coloured

envelope and place within it a piece of bluish paper, so that the two tints

may appear in juxtaposition, also a piece on which various shades of grey

have been dabbed, as trials used in colouring. If these are held or placed in

such a position that very oblique light may fall upon them from a lamp,

although the distinction of colour may be perceptible, it will be, under the

earliest illumination, so very slight as to be hardly cognizable if viewed from

an  angular  position  equal to the  supplement  of  90°                      i.  e.  let  the  lines  from
                                                                           :

the lamp to the illuminated surface just grazed by the incident rays and

from the same surface to the eye form an angle of 90° ; now let the lamp,

eye, and illuminated surface be brought into the same plane, although not

into the same line, and it will be found that the tints become much more

distinct. No more light falls upon the surface than before ; but the eye views

the surface under a difi'erent disposition of the angles of incidence and reflec-

tion, the consequence being a better appreciation of its inherent light and

shade. By placing the diflferent shaded papers in such a position that the

light from the lamp falls perpendicularly upon them, and bringing the eye as

nearly as possible into the same perpendicular line, we view the paper as we

view the full moon, the tints coming out in the strongest manner possible

and this is in accordance with the law that the greatest quantity of light is

irregularly reflected with the smallest angle of incidence. As the diameter

of the moon subtends a maximum angle of less than thirty -three minutes of

arc, the rays coming or reflected from her are nearly parallel ; from which it

follows that the path of the solar rays impinging on the moon, and passing
to the earth, will be nearly as the sides containing the angle known as the

supplement of the moon's elongation from the sun, which at full ecuals 0°.
   In applying our experiment to the moon in all its generality, we ought to

have a regular increase and decrease of intensity of tint, subject to small but

also to very regular variations. Is it so? In one remarkable and well-

observed instance, at so early a period as twenty-four to thirty-six hours

after sunrise on Plato, the north-west portion of the floor was so strongly

illuminated as to obliterate the well-known north-west streak. This appeared
to be an abnormal brightening of the floor, and must have been qmte inde-

pendent of illuminating or reflecting angle ; its bearing upon Mr. Pratt's.

remarks relative to an unusual exhalation of vapour causing an extension of

lucid area (see post, p. 261) or a flowing together of neighbouring light-streaks

is obvious. On the 12th of May, 1870 (the brightening of the floor was ob-

served on the 9th of May), it had so far subsided as to allow of the north-west

streak being seen, one observer (Mr. Gledhill) recording it as the brightest

on the floor, another (Mr. Elger) registering the part east of spot No. 16 as

very bright and well defined. This was from 96 to lOS hours after suniise.

That this increase of light was independent of either illumination or reflec-

tion, except as transmitting agents, is evident from the fact that at the same

interval from sunrise, 96 to 108 hours on the 14th of March, 1870, the eastern

arm of the " trident " was recorded as the brightest marking.

 -- AMr. Pratt, writing under dates October 17 and 18, 1871, says : " year or

two since I was reading Kirchhoff's ' Memoirs,' Roscoe's ' Spectrum Analysis,'

and several other works on the subject, and at the same time frequently spent

an evening in Mr. Mayall's laboratory with his splendid spectroscope. About

that time I often considered the possibility of vapours rising from the heated

surface of the moon, and wondered if the dark spaces were in any way
absorptive clouds, and became of the opinion, and am so still, that both the

darkest and the lightest markings on the surface may be but the appearances

of vapours  Looking at Proclus, Aristarchus, and the interior of Tycho,

I can never feel certain that their brilliancy is merely the dazzling reflection

from naked rocks ; and that great valley running N.E. from Tycho suggests
other causes for its Avhiteuess than merely different incident and reflecting

angles and different materials of its soil. The Mare Frigoris has very

often suggested to me (and I have mentioned the same to you more than

once) both the possibility and probability of its being covered with some-

thing very foggy in its nature. It has frequently had that appearance in my

telescope; and while objects on the heights of the rim of Plato have been

well defined, a general haziness has belonged to those on the Mare below,

full proof, I think, that the obscuration not only belonged to the moon itself,

but was confined to its lower levels. That under the circumstances the

intense heat must produce vapours from the surface, even if small in quantity,

and that, once produced, they must act as your theory supposes, seems incon-

trovertible. Some visible effects of their production, both in absorption and

reflection of solar rays, must follow as a natural consequence ; and if those

instances you have thought proper to adduce are not real observations of

those visible eff"ects, it I'cmains for some more assiduous observers to bring

forward more complete proof of their presence ; but I cannot then see that

even the supposed presence of such vapours is in the least degree negatived.

The proof of their presence by observation of their efl'ects would only be in

abeyance. Does not the softened margins of light-streaks generally on the

moon suggest a vaporous origin 'i Surely, in the case of Liune, it is as reason-

able as that the white spot arises from reflection from a sui-face of shivered

glass. The past observations of Linne and your present theory fit well to-

gether ; and it seems to me that if one may be forgiven for supposing the

presence of a small quantity of moisture on the moon, then the liotter the

surface the whiter the spots and streaks woidd become to our view."

    [In reference to Mr. Pratt's remai-k on the ivhiteness of the heated surface,

I may call to mind the appearance of slated roofs under a July or August sun

which I have noticed. It is just as if the slates had been coated with a ivliite

pigment. Instead of a dark slaty hue they have presented a strongly decided

white, so as to induce the belief that the roof had been whitewashed or

painted white. Having given some attention lately to the so-called irregular
                   OBSEllVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.             261

reflection of ]ig]it, in connexion with the above remark I may notice that an

increase of light from dark sLatcd roofs is observed as the sun approaches

such a position in the heavens, with regard to the eye, that if the roofs con-

sisted of polished surfaces an image of the snn would be seen at the moment

when the angle of reflection equalled the angle of incidence ; and this tendency

to the formation of an image is greatlj' augmented by a falling shower, the

rain bringing the slates more into tlie condition of a watery surface, rendering

them comparatively darker, except at those points where the two angles meet.

Irregular and roughened surfaces on the moon will consequently appear

brighter at those periods in the lunation when the light from the sun to the

moon, and thence to the eye, falls in the lines of incidence and reflection.

At aU times irregular reflection from the moon is independent of the incident

rays ; but an approach to regular reflection attended with increase of light,

the epoch of which for each point of the moon's surface is clearly calculable,

must occur during every lunation, so that all normal brightening may be

easily detected.]

" Starting from the hypothesis, it seems to me that your explanation of the

variation of position of the  Jiglit-streahs must be  held  a  very reasonable one
                                                                                                                                             ;

and I beg to add a small supplement. I suppose that the maxima of midday

heat at the latitude of Plato are not always the same, that they run through

a slight seasonal variation, then a periodical diflerence in the quantity of

vapour raised would result ; and if the general outline of the light-streaks is

the result of the local conformation of the ground as related to the craterlets,

then an unusual amount of vapour raised; might cause two or more light-

streaks apparently to flow together for a time, producing an entire change in

their outline, afterwards, as the heat lessened, to resume their most usual

appearance. I have often thought the light-streaks suggested the remem-

brance of the mists and fogs which may be seen on an autumnal evening

from the elevated parts of our downs ; as evening advances the mists gradu-

ally appear winding about in streaky shapes or isolated in irregular patches,

according to the formation of the ground, while their margins, sometimes

sharp, are generally soft and ill-defined, very much like lunar light-streaks

to my mind, if they could be seen from a nearly perpendicular direction.

"There is a difiiculty as to the nature of the dark tints, supposing them to

be cloudy coverings; but is it quite certain that the middle tint is reaUy the

true colour of the soil? What if the darkest tint was the colour of the

naked surface, and if the middle tint, which appears at sunrise and sunset,

is a covering of the nature of hoar frost, the vapour which is supposed to be

raised during the luni-solar day freezing again on the sudden approach of

Wcnight ? But we are supposing the presence of moisture on the moon.

must not forget the Baconian maxim."

    [Mr. Pratt's idea of hoar frost is very suggestive ; not that the appearance

of the surface near the terminator is of that nature in the sense in which we

employ the term, for one would think that then the reflected light would be

most certainly white yet it cannot be denied that, generally speaking, within

about 10° of the terminator, the surface of the moon is such as wo may

suppose that of the earth to present after a cold clear frosty night, the atmo-

sphere being exceedingly translucent, so that objects are readily and clearly

visible. The lunar night must be intenselj^ cold, with enormous radiation,

by which, whatever gas or vapour may exist, both its bulk and elasticity

would be greatly reduced, especially towards sunrise ; so that it is quite

possible that an atmosphere, if such there be, would be of the rarest charac-

ter, and this would fully account for the clearness and sharpness of objects at

sunrise. Upon the supposition of the existence of an atmosjAere, and of the

exhalations arising from the intensely heating of the surface as the sun
approached the meridian, at a distance beyond 10° from the terminator, in

the absence of dense clouds, -we may have an undefined mistiness not fully

and entirely obscuring objects nor interfering with their distinct outlines,
yet rendering their aspects different as compared with those which they

present when they emerge from night. And this difference of aspect may
not only be increasinrj up to the epoch of maximum temperature, but diver-

gent, inasmuch as various substances will be variously affected by the degrees

of heat to which they may be subjected, some darlcening under the intensity
of the solar rays, others behaving in quite the opposite manner and exhibiting

something like luminositij , arising, perhaps, from heat-rays reverberated from
the sides of craters as the sun shines almost perpendicularly upon them.
That phenomena of the kind just alluded to are clearly recognizable upon the

moon there can be no question. "VVe have only to read "Webb's masterly

exposition of the progression of appearances during the luni-solar day to be

convinced that some such agencies as we have here supposed must be at

work.]

  --On the probable success of continued observation of minute objects Mr.

Pratt writes : " It has long appeared to me a reasonable expectation that

the effects of such a low-lying atmosphere (as only could be supposed) would

be much more visible in the search for minute detail on the surface than in
the observation of occulations ; while the former method might be expected
to yield results much more rapidly than the latter, as the duration of the
maximum effect to be expected in the latter case could not be much greater

than a second of time, while in the former case it might be observed con-
stantly for hours at a time."

                                                                      III.

   History of Streak a, with its adjuxcts, on the I^okth ajtd North-west
                                               Floor of Plato.

Lunation September 1869, from 9 hours before meridian to 12 hours before

                                                                        sunset.

    This streak was not obsei-ved until the 20th of September, 1869, when it
was first seen by Mr. Elger (see fig. 8). It is figured by him as a short,

straight, narrow streak, stretching across the north-west part of the floor,
 and forming, if produced, an acute angle with the longest diameter of Plato

drawn through spots Nos. 1 and 4. On the 25th of September, five days later,

Mr. Gledhill observed the streak, its form and direction being nearly iden-
tical with those of the streak seen by Mr. Elger. For the general distribu-
tion of streaks on the floor see 'fig. 9 and " Observers' Notes," interval 72 to

 60 hours, post, p. 295. On the 27th of September, near sunset, interval 24

to 12 hours, the streak was seemingly lost, as Mr. Gledhill records only the
 streak c as a broad baud of brightness, in width about one third the distance
 from the north rim to spot No. 1 ; nor does he specify it separately on
 October 27, 1869, under the same interval 24 to 12 hours.'

          Lunation October 1869, from 69 Jwurs before meridian to sunset.

    In this lunation the streak was picked up by Mr. GledhiU in the interval
 108 to 120 hours, covering spots 13, 19, and 10 ; he aligned it, and found that

if produced it would cut the north border of B. and M.'s A (438, Webb's third

edition of ' Celestial Objects '). On this occasion it was deemed advisable to

divide it iato two separate streaks, that east of spot No. IG being designated

" a," the western part " o." On October 19 Mr. Glodhill delineated it as a

narrow streak (see fig. 17, p. 238) ; but as he omitted the western part of the

floor it is uncertain if the continuation reached the border. On the 21st it was
recorded as brighter than on the 19th. On the 25th a dark space was seeu

between it and the border ; and it was observed by Mr. Gledhill on. the 26th
and on the 27fch, in the interval between 12 hours and sunset.

 Lunation November 18Q9,froni 111 hours before to 21 hours after meridian.

   On November 14, at an earlier epoch than it had hitherto been observed,

Mr. Gledhill recorded the streak as seen east of spot No. 16, the western

part " " being absent. On January 12 Mr. Elger (same interval, 60 to 72

hours) showed in his drawing the continuation " o," with an extension of its
north-west border to the north-west border of Plato, i. e. the floor from the
south-east border of " o " to the rim of the crater was equally bright ; this

brightness commenced on the east at "Webb's elbow. On the 19th of No-
vember the continuation " o " was observed contemporaneously with c, which
reached nearly to S, and was convex towards the border. This is in contrast
with later observations, in which c was seen concave towards the border

(see lunation April 1870, 2}ost, p. 264). The contemporaneity of c and " o "
indicates that a change had supervened between the first observation in
September and November 19, on which day Mr. Gledhill recorded a as tho
hrirjhtcst streak on the floor, and first observed Webb's elbow.

Lunation December 1869, from interval 24 to 36 hours after sunrise to interval
                                       48 to 36 hours before sunset.

   This lunation aflbrded as many as ten observations of Plato, so that the
progression of the illumination of the streak could be well traced. At first,

on the 12th, it was seen with difficulty, the north-Avest part of the floor being

brightest. On the 13th it was still difficult to separate from the north and

north-west part of the floor ; but on the 14th it was seen continued in " o,"
the two forming the brightest and best-defined streak on the floor. Interval
72 to 84 hours. The observations of December 12 and 13 are the earliest of
the bright north-west floor, which would, from its dip towards the border,
reflect more light soon after sunrise than at a later period of the luni-solar

day; and it may have been from this circumstance that the brightness of

 the streak merged into that of the floor. It is, however, noteworthy that on
 February 9, 1870, interval 24 to 36 hours after sunrise, the streak a should
264 REPORT-- 1873.

 have been seen as a sharp narrow bright streak, from the tip of the most
 northern shadow to the north-cast border nearly parallel with a line through
 spots Nos. 1 and 4, and no mention of a bright floor in its neighbourhood.

    On December 15, interval 96 to 108 hours after sunrise, the continuation
 " " was seen " fairly bright," but on the I7th it was not recorded ; a new

phase, however, was noticed, viz. Webb's elbow, which was continued in c,
 terminating the streak recorded as very bright on the west. This phase was
more fully developed on April 14, 1870. The brightness of the streak con-
tinued from December 17 to December 24 ; indeed it was recorded as the
 hriijhtest on December 21, 22, and 24.

     Lunation January 1870, from 36 Jiours after sunrise to 33 Jiours before

                                                 meridian jyassage.

    On January 11, 1870, 36 to 48 hours after sunrise, the streak was well
seen, its brightness blending with the bright north-west floor. On the 12th,
14th, and 15th, the continuation " o " was observed. On the 15th, 132 to

144 hours after sunrise, the streak o, which extended from Webb's elbow,
tvas quite separated from the border.

    Lunation February 1S70, from 24 Jiours after sunrise to 69 hours before

                                                 meridian passage.

   On February 9, interval 24 to 36 hours after sunrise, as remarked under

the December lunation, the streak was recorded as " sharp, narrow, and
bright." Either the streak must have been brighter than in December, as
seen during the same interval, or the floor darker; whichever of the two was
the real state, the difference is not explicable on a chai5ge of illuminating
angle, the altitude of the sun being the same both in December and February.

On February 11 and 12 the streak was well seen, being recorded as very

broad and bright on the 12th.

    Lunation March 1870, from meridian passage to 24 hours before sunset.

   The observations during this lunation were made under the reverse light,
i. e. after meridian passage. On the 17th and 19th of March the streak a
and the sector were the brightest markings on the floor. On the 23rd, under
a declining sun, the streak appeared diffuse and extending up to the north
border. This is remarkable, and indicative of the brightness not being due

to illuminating angle, which, from the slope towards the north-west border
being turned from the sun, would render the floor darlcr as seen by Mr.

Pratt on August 28, 1869, and by Mr. Gledhill on March 24 and Novem-

ber 15, 1870. (See Eeport Erit. Assoc. 1871, pp. 86, 87.)

       Lunation April 1870, from 36 hours after sunrise to 45 hou7-s after

                                                meridian passage.

   The principal feature in the earlier observations of this lunation is the
indcfinitencss of the continuation " o " which appears in Mr. Elger's sketch
of April 10 (see fig. 12, post, p. 275), but was not seen by Mr. Gledhill as a
distinct sharp streak on that day. On the 11th it was very hazy and ill-
defined. On April 14, interval 132 to 144 hours, the floor presented quite
a difiTerent aspect (see fig. lb, post, p. 285) to that of April 10, the continii-
ation " " being entirely absent, and the elongation of streak c towards the

Avestern arm of the trident e being concave towards the western border. On
the last occasion, November 19, interval 168 to 156 hours, when c extended

towards the south-west, the concavity waij in the o^jposite direction (see

Lunation November 1869, ante, p. 263). The streak a extended on the 14th
of April from Webb's elbow, and was quite separated from the northern
border of Plato. On the 15th it was recorded as very bright, the projecting
portion of c being brighter than on the 14th, and nearly joining the western

arm of the trident ; the continuation " o " was not seen. On the IGth c had
disappeared, n being recorded as bright and sharp. On the 17th it was re-

corded by Mr. Gledhill.
    In this lunation " o " -was seen from 36 to 84 hoiirs after sunrise. The

observations of April 11, 1870, and December 14, 1869, are synchronous as

regards interval from sunrise. On December 14 a and " o " formed together
the brightest and best-defined streak on the floor. On April 11 " o " was very

hazy and ill-defined. These opposite characters under the same solar alti-

tudes, as well as those recorded in the previous February lunation, cannot be
exijlained on the hypothesis of changes of illuminating angle, for there were
none, but point to some agency operating within the enclosure of Plato.
The appearance of the portion of c projecting towards the western arm

of the trident on the 14th, its nearly joining the arm on the 15th, and its

disappearance on the 16th, combined with the opposite directions of the

convexity in November and April, again point to recent or, we may say,

present local action.

      Lunation May 1870, from 24 liours after sunrise to 33 hours before

                                                 meridian passage.

   The commencement of the observations during this lunation was charac-
terized by the north portion of the floor being brighter than hitherto observed.

On May 9 both Mr. Gledhill and Mr. Elger recorded independently this in-

creased brightness ; in consequence the streak a could not be traced. The
moon's latitude at midnight was 4° 21'-9 N., Plato at that time being north

of its mean position. On May 10 the streak a was seen by Mr. GiedhiU.
On May 12, interval 108 to 120 hours, or from 12 to 24 hours before the

apparition of the projection c in April, this marking, although plainly seen,
could not be traced so far to the south as in April, nor was it so sharply de-
fined as in that lunation ; indeed all the west portion of the north-west area
was hazy as on April 11 and 12, and also on June 10. While this haziness

characterized the western part of the floor, the area east of spot No. 16 was
free from it ; the streak «, as seen by Mr. Elger, was very bright and well
defined. Is not this indicative of the haziness being due to local lunar
action, and of the restriction of such action to a very small area of the sur-
face, also of the inefficiency of change in the illuminating angle to explain

it ? On May 13 the streak a was recorded as bright and well defined, and

very bright at the locality of spot No. 19.

       Lunation June 1870, from 105 to 69 Jiours before meridian passage.

   Two observations only were obtained during this lunation ; the first on
June 9, 72 to 84 hours after sunrise, when streak a (query its continuation
" ") had the same nebulous appearance which it exhibited on May 10 ; the
second on June 10, 96 to 108 hours after sunrise, when the eastern portion
n was bright and wcU defined, the western portion "o" hazy, partaking of

the general haziness of the north-west portion of the floor. These observa-
tions are in striking contrast with those of February (see ante, p. 264), in
which neither the haziness nor the continuation " o " were observed. The
266  . REPOiiT-- ISrS.

brightness on the north-west portion of the floor appears to have declined

since May 9.

     Lunation July 1870, from 117 hoiivs hefore to 81 hours after meridian

                                                             passage.

 --Three observations were obtained in this lunation, on July 8, 60 to 72

hours after sunrise, when streak a was seen as a bright object ; on July 1-i

and 16, from 156 to 96 hours before sunset, a condensed brightness in the
central part of streak a being witnessed.

    Lunation August 1870, from 9 hours before to 141 hours after meridian

                                                                    ^oassage.

    Three observations are the only ones recorded, the first ou Augaist 11 near
meridian. In a drawing by Mr. Elger streak a is shown as very narrow,
and quite separated from the north border, the west end crossed by the

projection c from Webb's elbow ; " o " was not seen. On the 13th the streak

was seen by Mr. GledhUI, a dark tint of iioor being recorded by Mr. Pratt.

On the 17th the streak was recorded by Mr. GledhUl as the brightest amongst

the faint streaks observed.

        Lunation October 1870, from 81 hours before to meridian passage.

 --Two observations only were obtained, the first on October 6, interval 96

to 108 hours, when streak c was seen quite detached from the border, and
figured as narrow by Mr, Elger ; the second on October 9, seen near meri-
dian, when it (a) was shown as narrow by Mr. Elger, quite separated from
the north border, the west end crossed by Webb's elbow and c ; these toge-
ther form a curved streak, concave towards the west border (see ante, pp. 263-

265), the continuation " o " being entirely absent.

           Lunation January 1871, from 168 to 132 hours before sunset.

   In the first of two observations in this lunation, made on January 7, the
north-west part of the floor is recorded as being in the same state as in
August 1869 (see post, p. 269) ; in the second, on January 8, Mr. Gledhill
recorded the streak a as sharply defined, bright, narrow, and straight.

   Lunation March 1871, from interval 72 to 81 hours to interval 96 to 108

                                                   hours after sunrise.

   On the second interval, 72 to 8-1 hours, the streak a was seen extending

from spot No. 19 to spots Nos. 20 and 21 ; it is described as having been

very distinct. On the third interval. 96 to 108 hours, it was observed by

3Ir. Pratt as the fourth in order of brightness, the sector k and /3 being brighter.

  --Erratum. Fig. 9, p. 263, dele connexion between streaks ^ and e ; not in

ori*g»i'nal.

    In the Eeport Brit. Assoc. 1871, p. 66, the position of streak a is given
as determined by three sets of measures by Mr. Gledhill of the two ends of

the streak on September 13 and December 9, 1870, and May 1, 1871. The

streak is shown in fig. 4 of that Eeport as long and narrow. The numerous
observations of the floor, including those of streak a, show that not only is

the north-west part of the floor variable as regards its tint (light or dark),
but that the positions of the streaks are also variable ; and this variation is
confirmed by the measures, which differ in value just as the recorded posi-
--

OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.  267

tions differ among themselves. The point of intersection of the measured
streaks is in or near the locality of spot No. 19, at which a hrightness has

been observed. If the bright streaks are due to ejecta (see ante, p. 249),

their varying positions may not bo difficult of explanation.
   On September 13, 1870, the measures which determined the position of

streak a were as follows :

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ti

                            Elger. It was seen by Mr. Gledhill east of No. 16, " o "
                             being absent on Nov. 14, 1869, interval 60 to 72 hours.

                           On May 12 the projection c, although plainly seen, could

                            not be traced so far to the south as in April, nor was it

                             so sharply defined as in that lunation ; indeed all the

                            west portion of the N.W. area was hazy as on April 11

                            aud 12, and also on June 10.

                               This haziness on the N.W. part of the floor while E.
                            of spot No. 16 was well defined is very noteworthy, as

                             indicative of the haziness being duS to local lunar action,

                            and restricts such action to a very small area of the sur-

                              face.

                        Bright and well defined; very bright at the locality of spot

                             No. 19.

                        The streak a (query its continuation " o ") had the same

                            nebulous appearance which it exhibited on May 10. The
                            brightness on the N.W. part of the floor appears to have
                            declined since the early part of the May lunation.

                        The east portion (a) bright and well defined, the west por-
                             tion hazy ; it appeared to partake of the general haziness
                            of the N.W. quarter of the floor.

                                 These observations are in striking contrast with those
                             of FebruaiT, in which neither the haziness nor the con-
                             tinuation " o " were observed.

of sunrise. In reference to the dip of the floor to the margin there men-
tioned, which is well established, I may remark that on the 20 th of Novem-

ber, 1871, I noticed the streaks of sunlight at sunrise terminated on the east
at some distance from the border, indicating a considerable dip of the floor,
if the sunlight were reflected from the true floor. (See lloport 1871, p. 68,
Jan. 10, 3 hours.) In reference to the streak between spots Nos. 4 and 3, I
would observe that the continiious observations of the streaks rj and /3 by
Messrs. Gledhill and Elger strongly indicate that they are connected with

spots Nos. 4 and 3 ; the narrow shading between these spots, as shown by
Mr. Pratt, is most likely a shallow depression between the streaks if Mr.

--Pratt's suggestion of their being spurs be correct (?). W.U. B. Fig. ] shows

the dip of the floor to the E. border. Tint of floor 0-33.

   The difficulty experienced on the night of Nov. 20, 1871, in obtaining a good
view of sunrise on Plato (if inexplicable on the fact of different apertures
having been employed, 7^ in. on the 10th of Jan. 1870, and 2| on Nov. 20,
1871) may have been produced by an absorptive medium within the enclosure
of Plato : the appearance mentioned in Eeport 1871, p. 68, was more intensi-
fied than I had previously witnessed, and the western portion of Plato, that
       OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAK OBJECTS.      273

nearest the western border, was darker than the eastern ; and there, where
the sun's rays were more obstructed than further east, the peculiar appearance
of something reflecting the stronger light from tlie brighter border above the
surface was not seen. The most expressive description that I can give, after
twenty-four hours' consideration, is, in'the words of Schroter, " a kind of fer-
mentation." It is certainly very unusual for the clearness of objects near the
terminator to be interfered with ; but should there have been *' vapours " in
motion, catching momentai'ily the reflected rays and, as the sun rose higher,
the direct rays over the mountain-border, such an appearance as I witnessed

must have been produced ; and the presence of such vapours may occasion

the darker tint of the floor, and especially the indistinctness of the boundary
of the streaks of sunlight and the edges of the shadows. I never before
observed the floor of Plato to be so dark ; but I have seen it once only

under similar circumstances, except that of aperture.

                                       Interval 24 to 36 hours.

  -- --1870, May 9. Mr. Elger's record is as follows: "Markings not well

seen" (but he does not specify them) ; " the sector was the brightest." He

also says, " the northern portion of the floor [that which on August 26, 1869,
was dark and extended between the streak c and the border] was noted as

equally light ; the streak a could not be traced." On the same evening Mr.

GledhiU recorded the floor as light, =0-33, and that streak a was not to be

distinguished from the bright floor all along the north border. He described

the streaks as faint and rather diffuse, the sector faint, not sharp at edges,
and seemed broader than usual. Libration in latitude S. in August and N.

in May would tend to throw streak a apparently nearer the N. border in
May ; but Mr. Gledhill could not distinguish it from the general brightness,

                                                  floor of Flato.

   On referring to Mr. Elger's drawings of January 12, 1870, interval 60, to
72 hours, and January 14, 1870, interval 108 to 120 hours, I find the N.W.

part of the floor extending from Webb's elbow to very nearly the position
of the west arm of the trident equally light ; indeed presenting on the 12th

a similar contour to Mr. Elger's sketch of May 10, 1870, interval 60 to 72

hours, the diff'erence being that on the 12th of January, 1870, the streak
a was distinctly separated from the border. The streak a was first recorded
by Mr. Elger on September 20, 1869, interval 168 hours to meridian passage,
and his diagram of that date is strikingly in contrast with those of Jan. 12

and 14, and May 9 and 10 (see fig. 8, p. 263, and fig. 11, p. 274).
   On September 25, 1869, interval 72 to 60 hours, we have a diagram (see fig,

9, ante, p. 263) of Mr. Gledhill's in which the N.W. part of the floor is figured

as nearly similar to Mr. Elger's of the 20th, the streak including the three spots

Nos. 13, 19, and 16. On October 17, 1869, interval 108 to 120 hours, Mr.

Gledhill again saw the streak, and described it as a " well seen streak which
covers 13, 19, and 16;" he aligned it thus: "the streak produced E.N.E,

Awould cut the north border of B. & M.'s crater outside Plato." On October

25, 1869, interval 60 to 48 hours, Mr. GledhiD gives a diagram in which a and

" " occur with a dark space between the streak and the border. On November

19, 1869, interval 168 to 156 hours, Mr. Gledhill saw the streak a with its
continuation " o," Webb's elbow, and the streak c, " o " and c diverging from
the western side of Webb's elbow. The earliest instance of an increase of light

on the N.W. part of the floor, and of the observation of Webb's elbow during

hours. See also December 13, 1869, interval 48 to 60 hours, p. 278, when

                                                                  Fig, 11.

                                   Plato, January 12, 1870.--T. G. E. Elger.

Mr. GledhiU recorded the N. and N.W. parts of the floor as brightest. On De-

cember 14, 1869, interval 72 to 84 hours, Mr. Elger sketched a and " o," with
Webb's elbow, the west side of which merged into the streak " o." The streak
c seen by Mr. Glcdhill and the spots Nos. 13, 19, and 16 were not seen. Mr.
GledhiU mentioned the bright floor connecting a and 2 without a distinct streak.
The next day, Dec. 15, interval 96 to 108 hours, the elbow is not separately

given ; the two sketches (see figs. 11 and 13) very much resemble those of
January 12 and 14, 1870. The state of the N.W. part of the floor was nearly
similar during the two lunations, the greatest amount of light being observ-
able at the earlier epoch in both cases. Mr. GledhiU noticed the N.W. part
of the floor bright on January 11, interval 36 to 48 hours. In Mr. Elger's

--diagram of Sept. 20, 1869 {ante, p. 263), he gives three Ught markings the

sector h, the middle arm of the trident e, and a straight marking on the N.W.,
replacing the curved streak c of Pratt of August 1869. The western branch
of this streak appears to be connected with spot No. 19. To distinguish it
from h, which crosses it, it is designated " o ; " the eastern portion which
joins the N. border is a. On December 20, 1869, interval 144 to 132 hours,

--the floor was approaching its normal state.
    1870, March 11. Mr. GledhiU recorded the floor as "medium, =0*50,
like the tint of the Mare Frigoris."

    1869, December 12. Mr. Elgor says, " I could make out a portion of the
sector, but it was exceedingly ill-defined ; the remaining part of the iloor

api^eared to be of a uniform tint." Mr. GJedhill recorded the floor as light,

= 0-33, and the sector faint, nearly as dark as the floor. The streak a seen

with difficulty ; the N.W. portion of the floor brightest. The, shadows of the
west border had edges on the east veri/ well defined, as if a narrow strip of
7ic/Jit fringed them ivitho^tt nehidosity. [This last remark appears to be in-

compatible with the idea of both spots and streaks being difficult of observa-
tion on account of the bad state of the earth's atmosphere ; for the same
observer, with the same instrument at the same time, describes the sector
and a as difficult, while the shadows are so well defined as to exhibit dif-
fraction fringes. Should the paucity of spots and streaks on this occasion

not have been dependent on our atmosphere, then we have a different state
of things to that which conduces to the apparition of spots when streaks are

faint, and vice versa.']

  --1870, October 3. Mr. Elger recorded the sector as complete and faint,

but in strong contrast with the dark floor ; he remarks that it is unusual for
him to see the sector at so early a period of illumination. Mr. Gledhill
recorded the sector, with streaks a, /3, y, h, e, and ^, as seen.

Elger says, " th#-east arm of the trident was traced through spot No. 5 to

spot No. 1 ; it usually terminates near 5~." He also says, " although faint,

                                                                      u2

the markings were easily traced ; those on the east side of the floor, y, >;, and
/3, were decidedly the brightest ; »j was represented by a blight fan-shaped
marking close under the east wall." [This is clearly the bright object de-
scribed by Mr. Gledhill under date March 23, 1870, 36 to 24 hours (see post,
p. 296), before sunset on Plato; and it is evident that it retained the qua-

lity, whatever it may have been, which contributed to its bright appearance

during the intervening night. This quality appears to have affected the

whole of the northern part of the floor ; for we find, 36 to 24 hours before

the previous sunset, the streak a described by Mr. Gledhill as " diffuse and

--extending up to the north border, and the following forenoon it could not be

seen as a distinct sharp streak." "VV. E. B.] Mr. Elger described the streaks
a and " o " (seen as one) as ill-defined, especially the N.W. portion of it.
The eastern and middle arms of the trident were the only streaks seen on
the S.W. Mr. Gledhill, same evening, gives on a diagram the positions of
the sector and streaks more or less similar to those given by Mr. Elger, and
they both agi'ee in placing spot No. 5 on the east edge of f . Mr. Gledhill
describes all streaks as faint, and S and 6 (query e), on tinted plate in.
' Student,' p. 161, as meeting at a point two thirds the distance from the
west border to spot No. 1. The east edge of sector is described as cutting

the S.E. border a little west of the middle of the straight part of the S.E.
border, and the west edge of sector cuts the south border nearly in the
middle. Mr. GledhiU says, " the brightest part of the floor is the north and

north-west, near the north border." a was not seen as a distinct sharp streak.
" If," says Mr. Gledhill, " the east edge of the sector be produced to the

north border, the darkest part of the floor lies to the east of this line. Is

not this the line of fault marked in your key-plan (Report Brit. Assoc. 1861,
p. 183) some years ago ? and is not this the portion seen brightest near
sunset at Plato on March 24, 1870 ? " Mr. Gledhill noticed that the most
southern-pointed shadow (a blunt cone) from the west border was situated

on and in the line of the streak 61 (query e). He does not mention the bright

--part of T) seen by Mr. Elger, but gives the entire streak from spot No.- 4.
    1870, July 7. Mr. Neison recorded the floor as dark, =0*66; he says,
" Never saw the floor so dark ; spots very indistinct, not visible continuously."
This is remarkable at so early an epoch, when the floor is generally described
as light or bright. It is also remarkable that the spots should have been
indistinct with so dark a floor. Mr, Elger remarked that the sector could

just be traced.

     Determination of the position of sector. See Report Brit. Assoc. 1871, pp.

i66 & 67, and ante, p. 249.

    Mr. Gledhill determined the S.E. extremity of the east edge of sector as
 cutting the S.E. border nearly in the middle of the straight wall to the south

Eof II ''' 2, and the south extremity of the west edge as cutting the south

 border at a point characterized by a line through spots Nos. 3 and 17 pro-
 duced to the south border, i. e. spots Nos. 3 and 17 and the south end of the
 west edge of sector alicpi. [On comparing this alignment with the plan
from Mr. GledhiU's measurements (p. 66, Report 1871), it will be seen that
 it does not agree with the plan. There is abundance of evidence to show

--that the boundaries of the markings are variable in position. W. R. B.]

     Mr. GledhiU recorded the sector as but little brighter than the floor ; in

 the darker parts streaks a, j3, ij, y, ?, e, C were well seen. The N.W. part of
 the floor was bright, and blended with the brightness of a. 7'' 0TM. Streak

clearly up to the border, but it is very bright close to the border. " It

seems," says Mr. Gledhill, " as if it were thrown off by the bright lofty wall

close to the north of HE'/' 2." [The dip of the floor to the border all round

has been well determined. Does not this dip prevent not only the tracing

of the streak, but its really extending as far as the border?] The sector

passes on to spot No. 3, d (?) meets e about halfway from the west border to spot

No. 1 (see ante, p. 247, fig. 1); they are both well seen, are sharp, and the

--dark space between them is sharply defined. On the same day Mr. Elger's re-

cord was as follows : " The sector could be traced from spot No. 4, through

No. 17, to the southern rim, and from No. 4 to the south of the triangular

Eformation, II '/' 2, on the eastern rim ; but it was very faint and badly de-

fined. The streak y was not seen ; but I remarked that the N.W. portion of
the floor, especially near the border, was much lighter than the remainder.

No traces of the trident."

    The difference between the observations of Mr. Gledhill and Mr. Elger is

mainly attributable to difference of aperture, with a probable difference of

atmosphere                                                   they both  agree in the  greater luminosity of          the N.W. part of

may be noted that streak a was well seen on the same day. Another inter-

esting feature of the interval is,the retention, during the night between

sunset in March and sunrise in April, of the quality by certain portions of

the floor by which they reflect light more strongly than under ordinary cir-

cumstances. The extreme faintness of the sector on November 2 and De-

cember 2, 1870, as weU as its general faintness, is remarkable.

ferred either that the streak was really brighter than on the 9th (see ante,
p. 273), or that the brightness on the northern part of the floor had declined
in intensity. Mr. Pratt says : " b [the sector] and k were of the streaks the
most visible. The whole of the western end of the floor which was in hght

--plate in ' Student,' April 1870, p. 161.
   1870, March 12. Mr. GledhiU records the floor as " light, Uke the sur-

face of the Mare Prigoris, * medium.' " I have registered it as 0-42. He

says, " all streaks seen except X, which runs west from the spot No. 3." Of

streak  jj  he  says,  "         does  not  reach  up  to No. 4 ;  it is  a brush of  light near
                             ri

the inner border just to the N. of HE''' 2." [This certainly does not accord

with -q, but is much nearer the position of Pratt's I. There appears to be

--good evidence that the streaks sliglitly vary in extent and position. W. R. B.]
 --1871, January 1. Mr. Elger described the markings as " aU faint," but

did not specify them, except p, of which he says, " the new marking on the

south side of the floor could be traced to the east of spot No. 5 (to about half-

way between 5 and 17)." In his sketch December 4, 1870, Mr. Elger places

--spot No. 5 on the luest edge of ^.
   1870, August 6. Mr. Gledhill recorded the floor as medium, =0-50, and

the streaks as faint and scarcely distinguishable from the floor. On the

same evening Mr. Elger says, " Sector seen, but its borders were very badly

defined." He also described the west portion of the floor as of an even light

colour. This observation is greatly in accordance with Mr. Pratt's of May 10,

1870 (see ante, p. 277) ; the increase of light in both cases most probably

depended upon the same agency.

1869, December 13.--Mr. GledhiU recorded the tint of floor as light, =0-33,

the N. and N.W. portions being the brightest. The sector was well seen,

extending as far as spot No. 3, with a bright base resting on the border

a and its vicinity, both to the south and up to the north border, bright and

difficult to separate. It [this brightness] extends up to I [and consequently

includes k and c] ; c widens as it approaches the border of Plato. [Does

Mr. GledhiU mean that the light surface extended from the western arm of

the trident on the N.W. and N. as far as spot No. 3? If so, the great

northern streak would, in conse(]uence of -the sector and c being connected

by the extension of the sector to spot No. 3, have nearly the same contour

as given by Mr. Pratt on August 17, 1869, see ante, fig. 5, p. 252.] e and ^
were well seen. Neither y nor /3 were strong nor broad ; -q was the faintest

streak on the floor.

Mr. GledhiU speaks of streak I widening as it approached the border. This

widening is by no means an uncommon occurrence ; the sector is a familiar

example, also the streak »j has presented this phenomenon : both the sector

and rj ju'oceed from spot No. 4, which of aU the spots is characterized by the

most remarkable appearances. Now this widening is closely in accordance

with ejecta spreading from an orifice as it descends a surface slightly incUned.

   Mr. Elger has shown (Report Brit. Assoc. 1871, p. 71) that the surface
between spots Nos. 1 and 4 is depressed. Mr. Gledhill says : " I have never

noticed that portion of the trident east of the spot No. 1 ; I am looking for

it. I always see that portion of the trident in which spot No. 22 is situated

-- Eas nearly in a line with spot No. 1 and II '^ ^."
   1870, October 4. Mr. Elger saw the sector only; it was in strong contrast

--with the floor. He also exhibits the light border skirting the west side of

the floor. Mr. Gledhill says: " The west portion of the floor is the brightest

the line of separation runs through a point midway between sjrot No. 1 and

the west Ijorder, and both ways to the north and south borders. This space

includes Webb's elbow, c, the west end of ^, and S.W. end of e." Similar

observations of this light portion are recorded under May 9 and 10, the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

record of a bright N.W. floor.

  --1870, January 12. Mr. Gledhill writes, " Streaks all seen, but not so
--bright as last night." Same evening Mr. Elger writes : " Tracing No. I.

foot of the north border was brightest, especially at the N.W. ; all streaks

rather faint, especially the sector. Mr. Pratt speaks of " cloud " in the N-W.

and S.W., where a ray from Anaxagoras appears to cross the floor, inter-

fering with the trident, of which the arm east of spot No. 1 {'C) and the west
arm (e) were much obscured.

recorded the floor as " medium or light, like Mare Frigoris," registered =0-42.

--"Webb's elbow was well seen near the foot of the inner N.W. border.
    1870, June 9. Mr. Elger recorded the markings as faint and difficult to

trace. The streak a on the N."W. part of the floor had the same nebulous

appearance that it had on May 10. [Mr. Elger does not appear to have

noticed a brightness of the N."W. part of the floor equal to that observed on

-- --May 9.]
   1870, February 11. Mr. Elger writes: "All the markings shown on

tracing No. II. (1870, January 14) were seen, but they were very taint.

--The three branches of the trident could just be traced." On the same evening

Mr. Gledhill says : " Streaks a, /i, y, I, e, i; are well seen, as also the sector.
I see a faint streak yu just above the west end of a and parallel with it ; this
streak, if produced eastwardly, would pass just north of spot No. 3 (see
fig. 16, 2^ost, p. 286). The streak \ is seen easily, it is the faintest ; streak
/3 extends a little to the west of spot No. 3. There is a strong brush of

light from the border just north of II E '/'2, from which a faint streak runs up

to spot No. 4." [Is this Mr. Pratt's 12 its direction agrees, but its locality

is rather too far to the north. See interval 48 to 60 hours, 1870, March 12,

    1869, December 14. Mr. Elger recorded a and its continuation " o" as the
brightest and best defined on the floor, and he shows Webb's elbow in con-
tact with the N."W. border. Mr. Gledhill mentioned the bright floor con-
necting n and ri, but without a distinct streak ; he recorded the floor as

=light, 0-33, and all the streaks as well seen, jj the faintest, and the extension

--of the sector to spot No. 3 not easy. Mr. Elger says : " The sector I noted

as faint and difficult to trace ; the middle prong of the trident appeared to be
the brightest on the S.W. side of the floor ; it could be traced as far as spot
No. 14." Mr. Pratt noticed the trident shaded off round spot No. 1, the
sector nearly divided between spots Nos. 3 and 4, and y in contact with the

sector.

    1870, September 6. Mr. Gledhill recorded the floor as dark, =0-66.

Streaks very bright and well seen.

 --1869, jS'ovcmber 15. Mr. Pratt has the following remarks on the light-
--streaks: " The trident and sector were both reobserved complete, with the

exception of the shading off round spot No. 1. (See interval 72 to 84 hours,

Aante,]). 280.)  comiderabh additioii ivas aho well observed. 1°. The sector

appeared widened out between spots Nos 3 and 4. 2°. The N.E. streak was

traced of the form sketched, and in contact with the border. [This appears

to be the earliest instance of the greater reflective power of the northern part
of the floor, which is independent of libration, inasmuch as both on August

26, when the streak was quite free froin the border, and on this day, when

in contact with it, the moon had south latitude. It is also independent of

illuminating angle, as it was most extensive and brightest at an interval of

A24 to 36 hours (see that interval, May 9).] 3°. tongue of light jutting

out from the border on the north of B. and M.'s ^, /. e. the high rock at the

east of Plato. [This is the streak »/, first recorded by Mr. Gledhill on Oc-

tober 19, 1869.] 40. The sector [or streak] on the north of spot No. 3 spread
out as far as the border, and enclosing spots No. 20 and 21. 5°. The streak

c made another contact with the border near spot No. 16 [this contact is
Webb's elbow]. The streak was connected with the N.W. arm (e) of the
trident, being continued beyond its usual termination near spot No. 13, and
could be traced to about halfway towards the middle arm (e), beyond which
it was quite invisible." [On the next luni-solar day, December 13, 1869,
interval 48 to 60 hours, the same general distribution of the streaks, with

the extension of the lighter surface to the north border, was seen by Mr.
Gledhill (see ante, p. 278).] In Mr. Gledhill's observations of November 15,

he does not mention the streaks separately, but gives on the diagram the

sector b diverging from spot No. 4. He does not indicate the widening out
between spots Nos. 3 and 4, as seen by Mr. Pratt. He gives y and /3 both

up to the border, also the streaks a and c, but does not give the continuation

--into the trident, which it appears he did not observe except the streak B.
    1869, October 16. Mr. Pratt recorded the junction of the trident as

difficult, especially so just west of spot No. 1 ; the sector and c much the

brightest.

evening recorded the sector as very easy ; also I, k, c, a, and ft ; 7; was seen,

not as a streak, but a tongue of light running from the border towards spot

No. 4. The streak n (very rarely seen) was observed extending from spot

No. 1 to streak k ;    and e, the eastern and the  middle arms of the trident, were

 --1871, March 3. Mr. Gledhill recorded the floor as dark, =0-66 ; the streaks

bright. Mr. Pratt recorded the floor as medium, =0-50. This evening he

--witnessed an unusual display of streaks, as many as fifteen, which he arranged

in order of brightness thus : the sector, the curved streak k near the north

border, the streak /3 from the triple group of spots Nos. 3, 30, and 31, the
streak a from spot No. 19 to the N.E. border, the middle arm of the trident e,

the N.W. curved streak c, "Webb's elbow i, the eastern arm of the trident ^,
the N. bifurcation of the western arm ^ and the southern bifurcation 6,
the narrow streak from S.W. to N.E., n, very rarely seen, the short arm I of

the sector towards the S.E. also very rarely seen, the streak y from spot

No. 6, the streak r) from spot No. 4, and the neiv streak p from spot No. 5 to

spot No. 17 (this, Mr. Pratt remarked, was seen easily joining the eastern

arm of the trident and the sector from a point opposite to No. 5 to a point

closely south of No. 17; it was narrowed about the middle). The streaks /3,
a, and I were far brighter than in their normal state.

  --1870, May 12. Mr. GledhUl recorded the floor as dark, =0-06, and the

streaks bright. He does not mention the sector ; but from his remark that

all were seen, and Mr. Elger regarding it as " very bright," I have in-

serted it.

 -- --1870, March 14. Mr. Elger's record is as follows : " The markings were

not well seen ; the eastern arm of the trident was the brightest, and could be

traced from the south rim of Plato to spot No. 1, passing to the west of spot
No. 5. The streak y was very plain ; the rest of the markings were veiy

--faint and difiicult to make out." Mr. Elger further says : " In spite of the

haziness of the sky, the markings and minute details of the northern part of

the 3Iare Imbriiim were seen with unusual distiuctness." [This is another

important testimony to the unequal visibility of objects, and would indicate

that the indistinctness of the markings on Plato was dependent upon some
agency more immediately connected with the moon itself.] About an hour

earher on the same evening Mr. Pratt observed Plato, and recoi'ded the mark-

ings as rather easily visible. He observed all he had seen before, which were

of almost the identical forms of 1869, November 15 (see interval 84 to 96

hours, a7iie, p. 281). He also recorded two bright streaks irom. Anaxar/oras,
which crossed the N.W. border, the streak c, and the N.W. arm of the

trident, and somewhat confused at fii'st sight the light-markings on the

--floor (see ante, p. 280).
   1870, June 10. Mr. Elger recorded the sector and the streak y as the
brightest markings ; tj and f3 were faint, especially r/ ; /3, though faint, could
be traced up to spot No. 3. The eastern portion of a was bright and well
defined ; the west portion had a hazy appearance, as, indeed, had the whole
of the N.W. portion of the floor. Mr. GledhUl described the streaks and

--spots as bright, and seen as on June 9; he recorded the floor as dark, =0-66.

Taking into consideration the difl"erence of apertures, were they first within

reach of the smaller aperture of 4 inches on this day (December 15) ? If so,

did they become brighter during the interval that elapsed since Mr. GledhiU

passed beyond spot No. 4, and had its apex about spot No. 3. It was also seen

at this point again on October 21 at 12 hours." [Was there any connexion be-

tween the sector extending as far as spot No. 3 and the streak /3 emanating

from the same spot, as if the spot or group had been in eruption ? The very

short extension of the streak /3 seen once or twice by Mr. Gledhill beyond

spot No. 3 towards the S.W. is curious, as if it were an outflow in that direction

--which could not proceed in consequence of the rising of the ground.] Mr.

Gledhill farther remarks : " I saw fi a few hours before sunset on Plato on
the 27th of September, 1869, and also the sector and some other streaks.

The streak rj was first seen by me about 11 hours on October the 19th, 1869.

It comes from that fine summit on the crater-wall (the rock ^ of B. and M.)

which casts the long shadow on the plain at sunset. The streak /3 I think

comes from a portion of the inner slope, which is often highly illuminated

streaks as emanating from the waU. Is it not more likely that jj emanates

--from spot No. 4, and j3 from spot No. 3 ? W. E. B.] On the evening of De-

cember 15,1869, Mr. Gledhill  recorded the      streak  ft as  fairly  bright,  and
                                                                                                »?

Bpot No. 32, discovered by him this evening." Mr. Gledhill's record of the

and well defined; ft brightest near spot No. 3, and faint at border. The
three arms of the trident, ^, e, e, faint, but easily traced ; the floor noted aa

very dark between e and e. The projection from Webb's elbow, c, seen

during the April lunation, although plainly seen, could not be traced so far

to the south as before, and was not so sharply defined ; indeed all the west
portion of the N.W. marking (i.e. the brightness in the N.W.) was hazy.

[Haziness on the W. and N.W. part of the floor was noticed on April 11,
1870, by Mr. Elger. On April 12, 1870, by Mr. Pratt, who described it as
very hazy. On June 10, 1870, by Mr. Elger.] The streak a east of spot

No. 16 was very bright and well defined, and Webb's elbow was very
evident. The localities of spots Nos. 33 and 35 were the brightest. On the
same evening and interval, Mr. Pratt described the sector as but faintly
seen, and with the very same aspect as his first view of it, viz. a streak
sloping more N.W. and S.E. than usual, its western edge quite straight, its

-- --eastern edge slightly curved and fan-shaped ; all' other streaks invisible.
    1870, January 14. Mr. Elger writes : " The markings were at times

very distinct, the east portion of y unusually so. I was unable to make out
Webb's elbow. The streaks ?;, ft, y, the sector, and trident were aU di-
stinctly seen. I much regret that the long speU of cloudy weather prevented

me from observing the markings after the 14th instant, as I think those on

the east side of the floor (y, »;, ft) were visible much sooner after the first
quarter during this lunation than they were during the last. [Had they
become brighter ? See Interval 96 to 108 hours, 1869, December 15, ante,

at the foot of the inner slope in a bright elevation on the floor close to
the foot, probably B. and M.'s mountain-peak ^) and spot No. 1."

   1869, October 17.--Mr. Gledhill recorded the floor " as dark as the south
part of the Mare Serenitatis (?), registered as medium, =0-50." He also re-

corded a weU-seen streak which covered spots Nos. 13, 19, and IG, parallel

to the streak /3, which, if produced to E.N.E., would cut the north border of

Acrater outside Plato. The western portion is designated " o," the eastern a.

almost up to it. The sector h did not appear to be equally bright, but

seemed to consist of light-streaks directed towards spot No. 4 (see fig. 15,

p. 285). The most interesting feature observed this evening was a project-

ing arm from the west end of a, apparently a continuation of Webb's elbow

across the end of a. Mr. Elger speaks of it as very plain, and occupying u

position a little east of the curved streak c, which is far from being con-

stant in its ajjpearance, even if it should have a permanent character.

--On this ray or projection I made the following remark when I received

the information : " It appears to be a lateral translation towards the east

of c, the portion of the curved streak west of spot No. 16, nearly in a line

with GledhiU's d ; " and I further said, " this has much the direction but not

the 2'>osition of Elger's h in the tinted plate of the ' Student,' April 1870,
-- AUp. 161." Mr. Gledhill writes the same evening : "

bright, y narrow and sharj), r) not well seen far from the border, Webb's

elbow conspicuous."

 --1870, May 13. On this day Mr. Pratt saw no less than 42 objects on

the floor of Plato, 26 spots and 16 streaks. The stem of the trident was

well seen, also the streak »/ as a fan or tongue. For Mr. Pratt's remarks on

the streaks, see Report British Association, 1871, pp. 88-91. On the same
evening, May 1.3, Mr. Elger recorded the streak y as very bright ; jj and /3

faint, r) the faintest on the east side of the floor ; the three arms of the tri-

dent faint ; a bright and well defined ; c (the projection from Webb's elbow)

nearly as bright as at last lunation, very bright at the position of spot

No. 19 ; sector very bright and well defined, a dark zone between its base

--and the border of Plato. [This dark zone is very unusual.]
   1870, January 15. At 6*^ Mr. Gledhill recorded "all streaks bright;"

seems to have been a portion of the streak c]. From 12 to 13 hours, Mr.

Gledhill  says,  "        is  fine  and  bright,  but  I   cannot   trace it  beyond  spot                 No.  3.

the east of spot No. 3. The elbow on the N.W. border, just to the S.W. of

the end of the ridge which runs from the wall of Plato out to the N.W., is
well seen ; it sends out an arm to the south, which is forked. The northern

prong, which extends to the west border, is the extension ' o ' of the streak a,

and the southern prong c meets the streak h west of the point of j unction of
the streaks S and e.'' Mr. Gledhill further says, " I also see another faint

streak sent off from the long northern streak « up to the border ; it cuts the

border just east of the exterior ridge." [This faint streak is marked r ; it

Ahas not been reobserved.] " narrow faint streak runs from a point a little

to the S.W. of spot No. 3, parallel to a, and joins the streak S between its
junction with c and e " [this streak is marked \] ; " there is also a stUl
fainter and shorter streak (f.i) just south of a, or rather its continuation, " o."

   The streaks \ and ^, discovered this evening, have been observed only
by Mr. Gledhill ; it is probable that they are too faint to be seen with

smaller apertures than 9 inches ; they have been seen occasionally between

January 15, 1870, and March 6, 1871.

annexed sketch of the streaks o, /3, r/,

by any remarks ; it would appear from

this that the whole of the S.W. part of

the floor was in some way obscured (see

pp. 255 to 262). Mr. Pratt's remarks on

the same evening confirm this idea ; he
says, " Trident near spot No. 1 invisible,

only the ends of the arms detected with

Hedifficulty."  also specifies the posi-

tions of the darh localities on the floor :      Plato, October 19, 1869.-- Gledhill.

next darkest area was closely S.W. of B. and M.'s rock ^, next above it,

S.W. of spot No. 1, and the lightest of the dark spaces N.W. of the rock ^.

We have here four areas characterized by a darker tiut, the floor itself being

registered as more than ordinarily dark, one of the darker spaces being

extended further towards the west arm of trident, which it almost touched

--remark : " The effect of a low power on ^ and e (the east and middle arms

of trident) is |to show their southern extremities as bright hazy spots, and to

hide their character as lines of light ; a higher power shows the whole Une as

a nearly (or quite) uniformly bright streak."

 --Fnder this interval and date I have the following memorandum : " It is

a little remarkable that the streaks ft, r}, and, stiU later, y should exhibit

such variations as to accord with a decrease of brightness, becoming lost to

Mr. Elger, but stiU lingering in the Halifax refractor. With regard to the

tint of the floor, observation has established that it becomes darker under a

high sun. Three hypotheses maybe suggested in explanation: First, Will

the heating of a bare surface produce a darkening of that surface ? Second,

Increase of angle of illumination, we know, occasions a darkening of the

vegetable covering of the earth : is it so with the moon ? Third, Can there

exist within the mountainous enclosure of Plato absorptive clouds the results

of vaporization by long-continued sunshine ?"

 --1869, July 23. Mr. Gledhill recorded the sector as fairly well defined.
 --1870, August 11. Mr. Elger described the markings on the east side of

the floor ri and ft as very faint ; the sector and y were not so faint ; the three
arms of the trident, ^, e, and e, were plain ; a, with Webb's elbow, were seen,

as in April and May last, very distinct. The drawing gives thp elbow and

the part of c as forming a sharp angle with a.

 --1869, September 20. Mr. GledhiU recorded the floor as dark,= 0-66, not

quite so dark as the south part of Grimaldi ; the sector easily seen. Same

evening Mr. Elger registered the N. boundary of the sector as extending

from spot No. 4, just past N"o. 7, to the east border. This appears to have
been an extension of the sector, including the streak y. For Mr. Elger's
drawing of this day, see history of streak a, p. 263, and for remarks, see

--ante, p. 262.
    1870, October 9. l^Ir. Elger recorded the sector as plain, »; faint, trident
faint. " I again suspect," says Mr. Elger, " the connexion between the

eastern and central arms of the trident observed by Mr. Pratt." Mr. Elger

gives a sketch of a and Webb's elbow, with c in a line with the elbow, join-

ing e, the west arm of the trident. The streak c, from Webb's elbow to the

west arm of trident, is curved, the concavity towards the west border (see In-

terval 168 to 156 hours, 2505*5 p. 291). Nothing appeared to occupy the area
between the border and streak except the plain floor ; the streak " o " en-

tirely absent. See intervals 132 to 144 hours, and 168 to meridian, ante,

pp. 285, 288).

  --1870, April 16. Mr. Gledhill recorded the floor as dark,=0-66 ; the streak

 o is described as bright and sharp. The same evening Mr. EJger writes :
 " The markings appeared as on the previous night, with the exception of the
 projection from Webb's elbow (c), which I could not see." This is note-
worthy, as on the 14th and 15th it was evidently increasing, now it seems to
have suddenly disappeared ; it does not appear to have been observed by Mr.

--Gledhill.
    1871, January 7. Mr. Elger recorded the markings all plain. The curved
 marking on the N.W. side of floor appeared exactly as shown in the ' Student,'

pApril 1870, p. 161 ; the elbow i was distinctly seen. The new marking

 was also well seen ; spots Nos. 5 and 17 were connected by it : at times y
 seemed to be a prolongation of it ; it could not be traced through the sector.

    The observation by Mr. Elger of k and e with Webb's elbow, being exactly

 as given in the ' Student,' is interesting, especially as contrasted with the
 observations, also by Mr. Elger, of the prolongation of the elbow at a sharp

 angle with a (see ante, pp. 284, 289), from which it may be inferred that the

 streak is variable in position ; and this gives further countenance to the con-

 clusion that the N.W. portion of the floor is the most variable.

  --1870, August 12. Mr. Pratt recorded the floor as very dark, Mr. Neison
--recorded it as dark. Mr. Pratt says : " In moments of best definition the area

 comprised between spots Nos. 19, 1, and 4 and the northern and north-east
 rim was not nearly so well displayed as the rest of the floor, giving a strong
 impression of an obsciiring medium existing there. The dark parts of the
 floor were darker near the rim."

     1869, September 21.- Mr. Gledhill recorded the floor as not so dark as the
 extreme south jiart of the floor of Grimaldi. Of streak c he says, " Spots
 Nos. 13, 19, and 16 are well seen, a streak of light connects them ; it is a
 thick, dense streak, not faint and difluse," The sector he describes as
 " bright, permanent."

--and figured a short streak from the N.W. border very bright. On this I

remark : " The elbow of light tint described by the Kev. T. W. Webb as seen

by him on Oct. 24, 1855 (see monogram of the Mare Serenitatis, p. 13), was

well seen (and very bright) by Mr. Gledhill, 18(39, Nov. 19, moon's latitude

+4° 10' S. On the 16th the moon's latitude, 5°, was more favourable for

seeing it ; but it does not api)ear, from Mr. Gledhill's observations, that it

was then visible."      See Mr. Gledhill's                                                                                         remarks      on  the  streaks                           y,  and/3,  rj,

ante, p. 283.

   It woald appear that, so far as the streaks are concerned, the N.W. part of

the floor exhibits the greatest amount of variation. Looking at Mr. Gled-

hill's diagram of November 19, and taking into consideration the general

structure of the floor, we have in the S.W. the arms of the trident radiating

from spot No. 1; in the S.E., the sector fan-shaped, the sides radiating from

spot No. 4; in the N.E., /3 specified by Mr. GledhiU as one of the brightest

Nowstreaks from spot No. 3, and a, (i, t], and y more or less parallel.

bearing in mind that Plato has suffered dislocation from a fault from N.W.

to S.E., that spot No. 1 is opened upon the highest part of the floor, and that

spots Nos. 3 and 4 occur on the N.E. slope from the fault, it is not a little

significant that the directions of the streaks are from higher to lower ground.

Mr. Pratt suggests that the light-streaks are coincident with formations
analogous to " spurs " from the chief centres of the residual activity on the

--floor (see Report Brit. Assoc. 1871, p. 95).
   1869, November 19. On this evening Mr. Gledhill observed the streak a

and its continuation " o " ; he also saw, forking from the locality of spot
No. 16, the curved streak c, convex to the west border (see ante, pp. 263,

264, 285, 289). On contrasting Mr. Elger's and Mr. GledhiU's sketches of

Sept. 20 and 25 respectively with Mr. Gledhill's of Nov. 15 and 16, and espe-
cially of Nov. 19, the existence of c and " o" as separate streaks is imdeniable.

On Sept. 20 and 25 " o " was distinctly recorded by two independent observers ;
it was also recorded on Oct. 25, 26, and 27 by Mr. Gledhill. On Nov. 15 it

was not seen by Mr. Gledhill, nor on the 16th, the streak c passing over and

beyond spot No. 13. On Nov. 19 there was a great development of light-
streaks, the N.W. part of the floor exhibiting the curved streak c, with " o "

and a and Webb's elbow in contact with the N.W. border. Mr. Pratt recorded

the N.W. streak making a contact with the N.W. border, near spot No. 16,

--on Nov. 15.
   1870, October 10. Mr. Elger recorded y and /3 as plain, jj faint; the con-

nexion by p between the centre (e) and eastern (i^) arms of trident seen.

Trident and markings on N.W. side of floor as on the 9th of October. Spot

No. 5 is recorded as seen on the east edge of the east arm of trident (see

ante, pp. 254 and 275). Messrs. Pratt and Neison recorded the floor as
" medium," and Mr. Gledhill recorded it as " very dark." The lighter tint,

as seen by Messrs. Pratt and Neison, is exceptional. Mr. GledhUl mentioned

that the sector was composed of bright lines radiating from the apex to the

base (see ante, p. 285). Mr. Elger witnessed a similar appearance on April 14,

1870. (Interval 132 to 144 hours.)

1870, July 14.--Mr. GledhiU recorded the floor as dark =,0-66. The

sector and streaks seen were dense and bright ; the streak rj was seen near

the border ; o had a condensed brightness in the middle ; the south ends of the

south streaks ^ and e were brightest. With powers 150 and 115 the sector
appeared to be condensed at the apex. On the same night (July 14) Mr.

IngaU speaks of the floor being, at times of fine definition, covered with spots

=of Ught. I have registered it as very light, 0-00 ; it must, however, be

considered as exceptional, the floor being dark under a high sun. This extra-

ordinary spottiness of the floor appears to be of the same nature as the ap-

pearances of the Mare Crisium, related in Webb's ' Celestial Objects,' third edit.,

&pp. 82 83. Mr. lugall gives the distribution of the markings as follows :

First. A. large white cloud stretching half round the crater-floor from spot

No. 14 to spot No. 3. This white cloud occupies the position of the middle

and the^east arms of the trident and that of the sector, with its extension to

spot No. 3, the sector and the two arms of the trident being connected. It

is remarkable that this cloud is entirely separated from the border ; and, so

far as the sector is concerned, we have a similar observation by Mr. Elger on

AMay 13, 1870. (See Interval 132 to 144, ante, p. 286.) Seco7id. detached

fainter cloud on the N.W. part of the floor, which occupies precisely the posi-

tion of the curved streak c, with its convexity towards the border ; it incloses

Aspot No. 16. Third. small detached mist on the S.W. part of the floor,
Awhich occupies the position of GledhiU's streak 6. Fourth. curious brush

of light adjoining the N.W. border (Webb's elbow), much brighter near the

wall. The difference between Mr. GledhiU's and Mr. IngaU's observations,

particularly as regards the absence of streaks near the border, except Webb's

elbow, which characterizes Mr. IngaU's, is doubtless due to the difference of

apertures. The elbow appears to have been seen well in both instruments.

--1869, August 23.--See atite, p. 253.

1870, November 9. Mr. Elger recorded the markings as faint, except the

--sector and y ; the latter is described as unusually bright.
    1869, October 21. Mr. Gledhill described the streaks a, /3, rj, and y as

seen on the 19 th, but brighter ; he also described the apex of the light-

--sector as reaching to about spot No. 3 ; he has, further, this remark : " On

the S.W. rim of Plato, near or at the foot of the inner slope, are three bright

--foci; from these the three great bright streaks on the floor proceed, (1) a

line from the uppermost, on the S. border, produced to N.E., cuts spots Nos. 1

and 3 [this must be the streak e] ; (2) a line from the next lower produced
passes just S. of spot No. 3 [this is GledhUl's 6] ; (3) a line from the lowest,
towards the N.W., cuts the E. border of Plato just below or N. of II E"''^. I

could not trace the streaks well which proceeded from these foci. On the same

evening, with the Royal Astronomical Society's Sheepshank's telescope No. 5,
aperture 2-75 inches, power 100, I observed Plato and found the floor very

iU-defined, the sector the only light marking visible ; it was brightest towards

the S.E. border. Definition, Earth's atmosphere * very bad, much boiling and

fluttering.' The definition on the moon was very irregular ; Plato was very

difficult to observe, while the markings around Copernicus and Kepler were
--admirably seen. I determined the following tints : the surface aroundKepler

   This I apprehend to be a, as Mr. GledhiU generally describes it as such.

       1869, December 20.--Mr. GledhiU recorded the floor as dark, =0-66.

   Streak seen (bright) ; sector a fine striking object. On the same evening

   Mr. Pratt recorded the markings as peculiarly indistinct, from which he

   considered the apparent difterence of form which he observed to arise.

   The trident near spot No. 1 was shaded off. The greatest peculiarity shown

   by Mr. Pratt in his diagram is a bifurcation in the neighbourhood of streak (3,
   or rather two streaks from spot No. 3 instead of one. Mr. Elger on the

   same evening showed one only, very narrow, and remarked the portion

   of the floor between /3 and jj to be very dark. Mr. Elger further said, " a
   remarkable feature observed was the strip of light (streak y), which during
   the whole evening was by far the brightest marking on the floor." This

   streak is not recorded by Mr. GledhUl, who noticed the sector as being the

   most striking object. Mr. Elger saw a part of c and Webb's elbow i, which

   --he described as the brightest on this part of the floor.
      1870, August 13. On this evening the floor was recorded as " dark " by

   --three observers, Mr. Pratt, Mr. GledhiU, and Mr. Neison. Mr. Pratt re-

   marked: " On this evening, as well as 1870, Aug. 12, the tint of the dark

   portions of the floor was much intensified close to the rim ; it was the case

   all round, but especially so between b and ^, between e and 4", and between

   ft and J/." Mr. GledhiU observed the streaks to be very bright ; they appeared
   to stand out in reUef. Compare with Mr. Pratt's suggestion (1870, October

   --17) of the light-streaks being analogous to spurs (Eeport, 1871, p. 95).

The darker parts of the shaded portions of the floor were but just perceptible

--with attention.
    1869, September 25. Mr. Gledhill described the tint of the floor as " not

much deeper than that of the Mare Imbrium." He appears to have seen

streaks c [" a strong streak of light connecting the spots Nos. 16, 19, and 13,
which were not seen "], k [ " a diffuse streak of light runs east from spot
No. 3 parallel to that crater along spots 16, 19, 13 "], and the connexion of
K with the sector [" a streak is seen from spot No. 4 to spot No. 3, as if a

--continuation of the sector "]. On these I have the following remark : " c from

the S.W. of spot No. E13 (not seen) to II 2'/' on the east border made out

in separate streaks." The continuous direction of these streaks forming one
white line was seen by Mr. Pratt on August 17, 23, 26, and 28 (see pp. 252-
254). Mr. Gledhill desci-ibed the three arms of the trident as follows :

A" [e] rectangular luminous patch stretches from the south rim of Plato to

spot No. 14, embracing it and passing on till nearly in a line with spot

No 1, at which point a luminous streak [e] shooting from the rim and em-
bracing spot No 22 meets it. This latter streak seemed to become a mere
line as it approached the streak e." The S.E. arm [^] is described as "an

irregular rectangular patch of light running from the south rim to spot No. 1

nearly." It does not appear that Mr. Gledhill observed the junction of the

three arms. The N.W. arm [e] is described as '* very bright, the brightest,
the greatest brightness being close to the rim of Plato." The central arm
[e] is described as " less bright," and the S.E. arm [^j as " still fainter."
The apex of the sector is described as beyond spot No 4, distinctly enough
extending to the streak /3 running from spot No. 3 to rim. The following

note is appended by Mr. Gledhill: '· I could not see the limits of the three
arms of the trident as they approached the centre." From his sketch Mr.
Gledhill appears to have seen the streak " " and its continuation a, his
delineation being almost identical with Mr. Elger's of September 20. It is
not at all improbable that a change had occurred in the N.W. part of the

in the larger aperture of the Halifax refractor, as compared with the seeings

and drawings of Mr. Pratt in August 1869 ; the change consisted in the

fading of k and c and the intensification of a and " o."

an intensified form of the streak rj, and was the most striking object on the floor.

OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.  297

 --1870, November 14. Mr. Pratt at 10 hours recorded as follows :

" Definition very bad ; a large area of the floor to the S.E. shaded off deli-
cately, as of a slightly lower level. Tint of unshaded part a little darker
than the surrounding Mare, that of the shaded portion as dark again. The out-
line of the shaded part conforms roughly with that area of the floor adjoining
the inner edges of streaks b and k." [Mr. Pratt has furnished a sketch, dated
1870, November 15, 11.50, which I apprehend from his letter, combined with
the date of his observation, should be November 14, and that the S.E. part
of the floor should be S.W. ; with these corrections the sketch and observa-

--tions, agree.] Mr. Pratt's record proceeds thus: "These observations have

much confirmed in my own mind some previous ideas, faintly shaped by

former views, that the light-streaks are merely parts of the floor relatively
raised and perhaps more rugged and broken (hence one cause for their con-
trast in tint with the rest of the floor), and that the spots are, especially several
of them, raised : perhaps they are the centre points of the latest activity, which

also possibly produced the streaks by raising them above the level. Was it

by successive deposits of ejected material ? One would have expected a lava-
like deposit after reading Piazzi Smyth's ' Tenerifl'e.' " [The contrast of colour
is a most important study, which may be greatly advanced by continuous
observations of the variations in intensity of two or more neighbouring spots.]
On the same evening, November 14, Mr. Gledhill recorded the floor as light,
=0-33, and the streaks as very faint. Mr. Gledhill noticed that the floor

was separated into a lighter and darker portion, the line of separation con-
sisting of the west edge of the sector produced to meet the north border. The
floor to the east of this line is bright, and to the west darker. [This line
would be nearly in the direction of the fault in the neighbourhood of which
the surface is raised, and the difference of tint is most likely produced by the
obliquity of the sun's rays.] Mr. Pratt's sketch is in perfect accordance with

Mr. Gledhill's observations.

   1869, October 26.--Mr. Gledhill recorded the floor as bright, =0-33. The

spots, except No. 1, were not readily seen ; the sector and streaks were faint.

Sinus Iridum, nor so light as that of Archimedes; itis registered as light, =0-33.
Mr. Gledhill described the streak c as a broad band of brightness, width
about one third the distance from the north rim to spot No. 1, enclosing
spots Nos. 13, 19, and 16 ; the streak /3 he described as a faint belt from
spot No. 3 to the east edge of Plato. The limits of both bauds were very

indefinite.

                                      APPENDIX.

    Although the epochs of the following observations are not within the
period embraced in the foregoing discussion, they bear so intimately upon

the results that a notice of them may not be inappropriate.
   On November 20, 1871, I observed sunrise on Plato with the Royal

Astronomical Society's Sheepshank's No. 5 telescope, aperture 2-75 inches,

power 100. At 5.50, Greenwich mean time, I made the following record :
" The appearance of Plato, examined at intervals of a few minutes since 4.35,

has been very curious to-night. I have been unable to divest myself of the
impression that a kind of sparkling or agitation played over the dark floor

deep in shadow. This appearance has latterly greatly increased, and now

there are two well-marked regions (but by no means distinct streaks of sun-
OBSERVATIONS OF LUNAR OBJECTS.  299

light) north and south on the floor ; they are parallel, and are separated by
a darker region of an intensity equal to the west part of the floor, which ex-

--tends over about one third of the longest diameter." At 6.0 the record runs

thus : " There is no doubt of the northern streak of sunlight existing on the
floor, and traces of the southern streak are becoming apparent. Not the
slightest appearance of the streak seen by Bianchini (see Eeport Brit. Assoc.

1871, p. 73) has been observed. G.20. The northern and southern streaks of
sunlight are both decided ; their western extremities lie upon the line of fault
from N.W. to S.E. The long shadow of the peak a is now seen ; it ahgns
with the north part of II E'/'^ and the rock i;, or rather the inlet between
them and the bases of the first group of mountains of the Alps west of Plato.
6-30. The light of the northern streak is the most intense, although both are
faint. 6.45. The southern streak of sunlight is greater in extent (width)
than the northern, perhaps nearly double. Although definition on the
moon's surface is generally good, there appears to be a want of defining

power witliin Plato. Occasionally I see something approaching to well-
defined shadows, but greatly inferior to what I usually see with this glass.
The streaks of sunhght do not come out with that intensity which I re-
member to have seen them on January 10, 1870. 7.10. Sunlight on Plato
increases in intensity, but the shadows are deficient in definition, and the

streaks terminate on the east at some distance from the border, indicating a
considerable dip of the floor, if, indeed, the sunlight be reflected from the true
floor. 7.15. In best moments I see the northern edge of the shadow of the
peak y. The general character of the reflected sunlight is faint. The north
edge of the shadow of y aligns with the south part of II E'''^ and the sum-
mits of the group of mountains west of Plato, the bases of which aligned with

the shadow of h and the north part of II E-l-^. The floor appears to be much

darker than the site of Newton to the south."

   On the same evening Mr. Elger observed and sketched Plato ; his drawing,

fig. 21, made at 7.30, aperture 4 inches, power 115, exhibits a feature which,

Fig. 21.

so far as I am aware, has not been observed before, viz. a number of streaks

parallel to the longest diameter of Plato, which Mr. Elger described as " very
                                                    --

300 REPORT--1872.

striking." At a still later period Mr. Neison observed Plato from 8.5 to 8.35.

He described the floor as " very dark," and gave two gradations of shadow,

that in the south-west being marked " dark shadow," while the portion be-
yond, towards the east, he marked " shadow." This portion is drawn as ex-
tending nearly to spot No. 17, bisecting spot No. 1, and passing a little west
of spot No. 16. On comparing the drawing with Mr. Elger's at an earlier
epoch, it would appear that Mr. Nelson's " shadow " was in some way con-
nected with the streakiness observed by Mr. Elger ; for by 8.35 the true
shadow must have retreated to about the position given by Mr. Neison for
his " dark shadow." The outline also of Mr. Nelson's " shadow " is not in
accordance with the peaks on the west border. Mr. Neison further described
the northern light-streak and sector as very distinct and of a pearl-grey
colour, and spots Nos. 3 and 17 of a pale grey colour, which he saw di-
stinctly. Spots Nos. 16 and 25 are described as " faint." " Although," says

--Mr. Neison, " this is extremely early, the spots were extremely plain." Mr.

Elger's remark is as follows : " Sunrise finely seen ; shadows of peaks y, 2, e
very shai-ply defined ; no spots observed."'

   The darkness of the floor is alike recorded by myself and Mr. Neison ; and
Mr. Elger's drawing testifies equally to it, especially on the north-east portion.
It is this 'darkness, so unusual at sunrise, combined with the difficulty of

making out the streaks and shadows on my part, and the obseiTation by

Mr. Elger of the peculiar streakiness, so unlike the ordinary light-streaks on

the floor, that lead me to suspect that on the 20th of November, 1871,
between 4.35 and 7.40 G. M. T., the interior of Plato was m. an abnormal

state.

   While the above-recorded observations were in progress, and the difficulty
of observing the interior of Plato from 5.50 to 7.15 was very great, Mr. Pratt
observed a very remarkable phenomenon on the Mare Frigoris, which he de-
scribed as one of the most singular and striking of all the local observations
he had witnessed. The following is an extract from his observing- book :

" 5.30. On a, general survey of Plato and wide neighbourhood, the very pecu-
liar aspect of the Mare Frigoris attracts attention. The appearance can be

compared to nothing but a kind of haze, entirely local, hanging round the

N.W. foot of the slope of Plato. It is the more conspicuous as nothing of

the kind is visible either on the Mare Imbrium or on the Mare Serenitatis.
The objects on the Mare Frigoris were indistinct, as if veiled. At 6.30 the
appearance was much modified. At 7.30 very little of the veiling was to
be seen. Between other observations frequent attention was given to it
until 9.0, but no return of the phenomenon appeared."

   The contemporaneity of my own observations of the interior of Plato with

those of Mr. Pratt of an immediate contiguous locality, is conclusive of the
connexion between the abnormal condition of Plato and the veiled appearance

of the N.W. slope, extending to the Mare Frigoris. On other occasions

Mr. Pratt has described the appearance of the floor of Plato as if seen through

a veil of thin white polarized clouds, such as appear in our own atmosphere.
Phenomena of this kind are strikingly in contrast with an appearance which

--I witnessed on the same evening and at the same time, it was the sharp

and weU-deflned character of the broad band of roughened ground extending
from the Apennines to the region of Ukert, Pallas, and Bode.

    Such observations as the foregoing remind one strongly of similar observa-
tions recorded on numerous occasions by Schroter, which are said by the

sideration, that wheiiever close attention is given to the moon's surface some-

thing of the kind is sure to crop up ; nor is it confined to eye observations

alone photography tells the same tale. In the letterpress to the fourth area
                         ;

of the Lunar Map I have given instances of differences between photograms
of various dates ; and in drawing up my monogram of Hipparchus, I com-
pared every object in every available photogram. It is much to be regretted

that a means of detecting differences, if not changes on the moon's surface,

should be so little utilized, for I have not met with any published results of

the comparison of lunar photograms except my own, as specified above ; and

Wewe know that numerous negatives must be in existence.       can hardly

conceive it possible that illusion can enter as an element here ; apparent dif-

ferences may result from flaws either in the originals or in printing, but these
are capable of being eliminated : and, again, on photograms we have whatever
differences may present themselves under the eye ; whereas in those observed
with the telescope we have the records only to depend upon, and these
records ^viU be more or less convincing according to the impression made by
the phenomena on the mind at the time. As illustrative of this I quote Mr.
Pratt's remarks in connexion with the phenomena of November 20, 1871 :
" Whether or no Lunar Meteorology ever becomes an accepted fact, I shall

always retain a strong belief that this observation was one of the earliest and

most complete records I know of, from the greatest intensity of the mist, or

whatever it was that obscured the region, until its entire dissipation by the
rays of the rising sun." With this Mr. Pratt contrasts an observation of the

--Mare Prigoris on December 27, 1871, as follows : " Definition of objects on

the Mare Frigoris fully as good as on any part of the border of Plato, in

marked distinction to the observation of November 20, 1871."

myOne of the results of  late discussion of observations of the floor of Plato

is, that certain peculiar phenomena, consisting of variations' of the brightness

of the N.W. floor and in the forms of the streaks thereabout, have been

noticed during the greater part of two years by two or more independent

observers. On the 22nd of December, 1871, Mr. Pratt noticed " a marked

haziness over the north-west part of the floor of Plato, an instance of very

limited mistiness." Still, comparison with other portions of the floor rendered

it to Mr. Pratt's mind a no less certain instance than the former one of the
Mare Frigoris ; for to one who has so constantly worked at the floor, even
limited phenomena would be as apparent as those of wider range to the

general observer.

   Now what are we to say to illusion ? Here are independent observers

during a period of many months testifying to the existence of the same phe-
nomena ; and not only so (for their testimony would have been weak had we

merely taken a disjointed remark here or there, or had one observer only, as
in the case of Schroter, recorded these seeings), but we have had the ob-

servations carefully examined and arranged under certain heads, the evidence

has been sifted, and we think that an impartial verdict would negative illu-

sion, and declare for some active element producing the phenomena observed.

What that element is becomes t. most interesting question. So far as we

have been able to make out, the most active agency that has modified the
moon's surface is volcanic. Have the appearances to which allusion has been

made any connexion with a continuance of this agency ?

302 REPORT 1872.

  Report on the Mollusca of Europe compared with those of Eastern

             North America. By J. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.R.S.

        [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.'\

After mentioning that lie had dredged last autumn on the coast of New

England in a steamer provided by the Government of the United States, and
that he had inspected all the principal collections of Mollusca made in Eastern
North America, the author compared the MoUusca of Europe with those of

Massachusetts. He estimated the former to contain about 1000 species (viz.

200 land and freshwater, and 800 marine), and the latter to contain about
400 species (viz. 110 land and freshwater, and 290 marine); and he took
Mr. Binney's edition of the late Professor Gould's ' Report on the Invertebrata
of Massachusetts,' published in 1870, as the standard of comparison. That
work gives 401 species, of which Mr. Jeffreys considered 41 to be varieties
and the young of other species, leaving 360 apparently distinct .species.

About 40 species may be added to this number in consequence of the recent
researches of Professor VerriU and Mr. Whiteaves on the coast of New Eng-

land and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Mr. Jeffreys identified 173 out of the
360 Massachusetts species as European, viz. land and freshwater 39 (out of
110), and marine 134 (out of 250), the proportion in the former case being
28 per cent., and in the latter nearly 54 per cent. ; and he produced a tabu-

lated list of the species in support of his statement. He proposed to account

for the distribution of the North-American Mollusca thus identified, by
showing that the land and freshwater species had probably migrated from
Europe to Canada through Northern Asia, and that most of the marine species
must have been transported from the Arctic seas by Davis's-Strait cui'rent
southwards to Cape Cod, and the remainder from the Mediterranean and
western coasts of the Atlantic by the Gulf-stream in a northerly direction.

He renewed his objection to the term " representative species." The author

concluded by expressing his gratitude for the kind hospitaUty and attention
which he received from naturalists during his visit to North America last year.

   They have both the same colour, and absorb the more refrangible rays of
tlie spectrum in the same mauner. That from nutmeg is somewhat darker
and less fluid. They arc freely soluble in ether, but not in alcohol. Their

general appearance, and the action of alcohol, gave an impression of their

being mixtures, such as might be inferred both from the results of analysis

and from the specific refractive energy.

  A +chlorinated product, 4(Cj,,Hj,Cl) C,,,Hn, was found to have 'a specific
Agravity of 0-8685 at 24°, a refractive index for of 1-4755, and a disper-

sion of 0-326 : consequent^ the specific refractive energy was 0-5475, and the

refraction-equivalent for so complicated a formula will amoiint to 446-7 ; the

usual values of carbon, hj'drogen, and chlorine would give only 385-8, and,
making the usual addition for phenyl compounds, the refraction-equivalent
would only rise to about 420.

  A hydrocarbon, apparentl}' possessing the composition (Cj,, H^.),,, which was

found among the products of the reaction of pentachloride of phosphorus
on myristicol, was somewhat dark in colour. It had the specific gravity of

A0-9515 at 24°, a refractive index for of 1-5143, and a high dispersion.

Its specific refractive energy, 0-5405, is but little short of that found for
cymene, viz. 0-5506, and is consistent with the idea of the substance being
cymene mixed with some other body not belonging to the phenyl group.

                          Dr. WrigMs Report,

At the last meeting of the Association a preliminary notice was read on the

action of certain oxidizing agents on liesperidcne, the terpcne of orange-oil

A(Portugal of commerce).  large number of further experiments have been

made on this essential oil, and also on nutmeg-oil, which is said to contain

another terpene (myrhticene) of boiling-point several degrees lower than

than that of hesperidene ; there being thus reason for supposing that these
two terpenes constitute a well-marked case of isomerism, it was thought best

to investigate the oils in which they occur before commencing experiments
on other and lesser-known essential oils. In many points the results are

not yet quite complete.

  &The oils employed were obtained from Messrs. Piesse Liibin, and were

believed to be perfectly genuine and unadulterated.

  --1. Oil of Nutmeg. It has been shown by Gladstone (Chem. Soc. Jouru.

1864, p. 1, and 1872, p. 1) that this oil consists essentially of a terpene

{myristkene) boiling at 167°, together with a small quantity of an oxidized con-

stituent boiling at about 220°, and giving on analysis numbers agreeing badly

with the formula Cj,,H,^0, and thence termed myristicol. About a kilo-

gramme of oil was slowly distilled ;  the majority came over below 200°                                                                                                                         some
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

boiled up to 290°, when a soft brown resin was left in the retort, constituting

about 2 per cent, of the oil distilled ; on combustion this gave numbers

agreeing with the formula Cj,,H5,0.=4C,gIIjj-|-Oj.

   Tlie higher portions of this first distillate appeared to be somewhat more
oxidized than this resin, portions boiling at 260° to 280° and at 280° to 290°
giving numbers agreeing with the empirical formula Cj^H^gO, ; these sub-
stances have not yet been further examined, being probably mixtures.

The lower portions of tlie first distillate were several times fractionated,

with the result of producing a considerable quantity of a mixture of hydro-

carbons boiling below 180°, and a small quantity of an oxidized constituent.

--314 REPORT 1873.

the " myristicol " of Gladstone. After several fractionations, however, it*
became evident that this substance alters by the action of heat upon it, be-
coming changed, first, into liquids of the same composition but higher boiling-
point, and finally into an isomeric resin, not volatile at 300°. The purest
unaltered "myristicol" obtained boiled between 212° and 218°; both this
and the higher isomerides boiling at 2Go° to 285° and the resin not volatile
at 300° gave on analysis numbers which lay between those required for the
formula) C,,,HjjO and Cj^Hj^O, more nearly approximating to the latter; from
this it is concluded that the " myristicol " of Gladstone is essentially a peculiar
kind of camphor, C^gtl^fi, which on heating becomes transformed into a mix-
ture of polymerides bcariug to it the same relation that the colophenes and
cedrenes bear to the tcrpenes ; this conclusion is strongly supported by the
physical properties of these polj^meridcs as examined by Dr. Gladstone.

   This polymerization by heat of C,(,II,j,0 bodies probably affords an ex-
planation of the anomalous results obtained in the distillation of certain
naturally oxidized essential oils, such as lign aloes, from which no substance
of constant boiling-point can be obtained, the distillates obtained in one

operation continually altering in another.

   The action of phosphorus pentachloride on myristicol has been examined,
and ajspears to be in accordance with the equation

                  C,,,H,,0 + PCL = P0Cl3+HCl+C,,,H,Cl, .

a reaction iudicatiug that myristicol is a kind of alcohol or phenol, i. e.

that it may be written C^,  K.  ] 0. The resulting product 0^^11^.01 is diiH-

cult to obtain even approximately pure, as the action of heat causes it to

split up into HCl and Cj^^Hj^. The hydrocarbon thus formed has not j-et

been thoroughly examined ; a considerable quantity of it becomes pol3'merized

at the moment of its formation into a yellow-brown viscid resin, not volatile

at the extreme limit of the mercurial thermometer, and having apparently

the composition (C^JI^.)^. It is proposed to obtain myristicol in larger

quantities, and to examine more fully this action, and also the action of

phosphoric anhydride &c. on it. Camphor gives rise, by the action of
dehydrating agents, to cymene, Cj^H^^ ; it wiU be of interest to determine

whether such a reaction takes place with myristicol, and if so whether the
same cymene is formed.

The hydrocarbons contained in the nutmeg-oil distillates boiling below 180°

were heated for some time in contact Avith sodium, and submitted to careful

fractional distHlatiou over that metal for several weeks ; fiually the whole

--was almost entirely split up into two portions one constituting about three

fourths of the whole and boiling at 163° to 166°, and the other, about one

Tsixth as large in quantity, boiling at 173° to 177°. Intermediate fx-actions

were at first obtained ; but by successive distillations these split up almost

Aentirely into the higher and lower fractions.  small quantity was also

obtained boiling above 177° ; but this contained a miniite quantity of an ox-
idized constituent not destroyed by the sodium, distillates at 179° to 181°

and 181° to 185° giving numbers on analysis adding up to 98-6 and 98-8

respectively :

The following percentages were obtained with the fractions that were free

from oxidized substances :

Boiling-point

  = =The formula Cj^H^^ requires- carbon 88-23, hj'drogen 11-77; wliilo
=Cj(,Hj^ requires carbon 89-55, hydrogen 10-45.

Prom these numbers it is inferred that nutmeg-oil contains at least two

terpenes, one boiling at about 164°, the other at about 17G°, or 12° liigher,
the former predominating, and the " myristicene " of Gladstone, boiling at

1G7°, being a mixture of the two. The lowest of these two terpenes does

not appear to be mixed with any great quantity of a lower hydrocarbon,

such as Cj,,H,^, but is not necessarily free from such admixture ; for quantities

of 9 and even 14 per cent, of Cj^^Hj^ in the mixture produce very little alter-

= H =ation in the calculated numbers, requiring respectively
                                           88-36,               11-64,

H =and 0=88-42,  ll-58. The higher hydrocarbon, however, contains cer-

tainly a considerable percentage of 0,^,11,^ (probably cymcne, which boils at
about 176°) ; for the observed numbers are uniformly short of the hydrogen

percentage required for Oj(,Hj^, and coincide precisely with those that would

be furnished by a mixture containing 20 or even 25 per cent, of cymene,

H = =such mixtures requiring respectively 0=88-49,
H= 11-44.                                  11-51, and           88-56,

As shown in section 4, the 163°-164° fraction yielded by careful oxidation

by nitric acid 13-2 per cent, of a mixture of toluic and terephthalic acid, in the

proportion of 1 of the former to 4 of the latter ; if it be assumed that these

acids arose solely from the oxidation of cymene, Oj^H,^, present in the hydro-

carbon employed, this would indicate the presence of at least 11-1 per cent,

of cymene in the hydrocarbon, a quantity which, as just shown, is less than

that which might be present without being appreciable by ordinary analysis.

+The quantity of toluic terephthalic acids yielded by the fractions boiling at

175°-177° has not yet been accurately determined, but it appears to be

greater than that obtained from the lower fraction. The general conclusion

drawn from aU this is, that it is not at all improbable that the terephthalic

acid produced by the oxidation of various terpenes, such as oils of turpentine,

lemons, &c., is derived, not from the C^JI^^ present in tlie liiidrocarhon used,

hut from tlie admixture of a certain amount of cymene in the substance em-
ployed, and that, in consequence, the supposed identity of such hydrocarbons

--and their relations to benzene are by no means proven a conclusion

strengthened by the results obtained \ni\\ the orange-tcrpenc, hesperideno,

from which no terephthalic acid at all is derivable by oxidation, although

otherwise its oxidation-products very much resemble those of the other

terpenes.

 --2. Oil of Orange-peel (Portugal of commerce). On slow distillation of this

oil the majority came over below lbO° ; a few drops of oxidized product came
over at 240°-250°, agreeing with the formula 0,,,H,,,O3=40,,,Hj,,-t-O, ; and a

small quantity, 2-S per cent., of a non-volatile inodorous resin was left behind,

=agreeing mth the formula 0^(,H3^O^ 20j,,TTj,-f-O3.

Like the nutmeg-oil, there is present a substance boiling at 210°-220°,

giving numbers agreeing nearly with the formula Cj^Hj^O, and converted by

heat into an isomeric non-volatile resin : the sole ditf'ercnce observed between

this body and the uutraeg-myristicol is in smeU, the one smcUing of nutmeg

and the other of orange-peel ; the smaU proportions in which it exists in

orange-oil has prevented anj^ minute examination of it as yet.

Fully 95 per cent, of the oil is a hydrocarbon which, after many distilla-

tions over sodium, boils constantly at 178° (corrected) ; Gladstone tinds

that hespcridene boils at 174°.

This is a terpene, as it gave on analysis carbon=8S-17, hjdrogen= 12-06,

while OjjjHjj. requires 0=88-23, H=ll-77.
                                                                  --

316 KEPORT--1872.

    It is evident that this body is not identical with the lower nutmcg-turpene
boiling at 164° or so; but there appears to bo some relation between them,

both yielding products of similar character by oxidation ; the orangc-

terpene, however, giving no terephthalic acid, from whence it appears that
the hydrocarbon is free from cymene.

  --3. Action of Potassium Bichromate and Sulj^huric acid on Nutmeg- and

Orange-Terj)enes. As mentioned in a preliminary note read before the

Association last year, acetic acid is produced by the action of these substances
on hesperidene along with carbonic and formic acids. Barium and silver
acetate have been prepared and analyzed. The portion of oil apparently not
attacked was found on distillation to contain an oxidized substance not
volatile below 200° (the hydrocarbon used was ivlwJhj ^olatile below 178°,
and contained no trace of oxidized substance) ; on distillation this gave a few
drops boiling at 210°-230°, and a resin not volatile at 300°, and giving

=numbers agreeing with the formula C,,,H.,^0 C,,,H,p + C,,,H,p-- H^. The

distillate at 210°-230°, on continued heating, acquired a higher boiling-
point and became resinized ; products boiling at 210°-230° in two different exr-
periments, and a polymerized portion produced from the two jointly, and boiling
at 240°-250°, all gave numbers almost identical Avith those given by myris-

ticol, and closely approximating to those required for C,,,Hj,,0. From these

numbers, and the peculiar and apparently characteristic properties of the

substance, it is inferred that a liquid camiAor of formula '»,," ( has been

produced from a hydrocarbon, Cj^H^.H, by direct oxidation ; in other words
that an action of a type hitherto wanting has been found, viz. the conversion

of a hydrocarlion into one of the corresponding alcohols hy direct oxidation :
hitherto this has been only accomplished by circuitous processes, such as

forming a chloro- or sulphuric derivative, &c., and the conversion of this into

the hydroxyl derivative by treatment with silver salts or potassium acetate and

caustic potash, &c. From a theoretical point of view, the interest attaching

to this reaction is great, as it exhibits closely the mutual relations of hydro-

carbon, primary alcohol, ortho-aldehyde, and ortho- acid, thus :

Hydrocarbon .... X' . CH, +        = X' . CH^OH .. Primary alcohol.
                                   = X' . CH( OH), .. Ortho-aldehyde.
Primary alcohol. . X' . CH,OH-j-0  = X^ . CXOH)^ ' . . Ortho-acid.

Ortho-aldehyde . . X' . CH(OH),

Heach substance being derived from the preceding one by conversion of
OHinto
        by direct oxidation.

During the last few weeks it has been shown by Oppcnhcim (Deut. Chem.

Ges. Per. v. 631) that by the action of sulphuric acid and potassium dichro-

mate on the hj'drocarbonCj^Hj^, obtained by heating aniline and the terpene

dibromide from oil of lemons (Citronenol), there are produced acetic acid,

terephthalic acid, and a body, Cj,,Hjj,0, apparently identical with ordinary

camphor. Schwanert (Ann. Chem. Pharm. cxxviii. 77) found that oil of lemons

gave terephthalic acid on oxidation with nitric acid. Inasmuch as hespe-

ridene has been found to yield no appreciable trace of terephthalic acid either

by the action of nitric acid or by that of sulphuric acid and potassium dichro-

mate, it appears that the terpene of orange-rind and that of the lemon-rind are

not identical ; the results obtained with the nutmeg-oil, however, render it

not improbable that the real source of terephthalic acid is cymene contained in

small quantities in the hydrocarbon examined, and that many of the ter-

pcnes hitherto described are mixtures of two or more hydrocarbons. It

would be desirable to have this point cleared up both in the case of ordinary
                                                       7 ;;

            ON THE CONSTITUTION ETC. OF ESSENTIAL OILS.                 317

turpentine and oil of lemons, as well as other terpenes, as much stress has

been laid on the production of torephthalic acid and of cymene from these

hydrocarbons and their derivatives.

The preceding experiments render it probable that the gradual resinizing

which occurs in terpenes on keeping arises from a spontaneous absorption of

oxygen and the consequent formation of the resinous polymerides (Cj,,H,|,0),,.

On treating the lowest hydrocarbon (b.-p. 163°-164°) obtained from nutmeg-

oil in the same way as the hesperidene, precisely the same results were ob-

tained, with the sole difference that a little terephthalic acid was also formed,

which was not tlie case with the orange-hydrocarbon.

The cliromic liquor gave an acid distillate which contained acetic and

probably formic acids ; barium and silver acetates were analyzed, and the

apparently unattacked hydrocarbon left on distillation a few drops boiling at

upwards of 210°, and giving numbers on analysis identical with those given

by myristicol, by the oxidized constituent of orange-oil distilling at 210° to

230°, and by the similarly obtained oxidation-product of hesperidene just

described. Whether these four substances are identical or not cannot be de-

cided ; but the only difference noticeable between them was in the matter of

odour, each one being different from the others in this respect.

The action of the chromic liquor on the higher boiling hydrocarbon of

nutmeg-oil has not yet been examined.

 --4. Action of Nitric Acid on Nutmctj- and Orange-Terj^enes. Schwanert

has shown (Ann.Ch. Pharm. cxxviii. 77) that where camphor and certain other

analogous substances are treated with nitric acid, there is produced, inter

alia, a non-crystalline acid, camjjhresinic acid, C^JI^fi^, which same acid also
x'csults when certain terpenes (e. g. Citronenol) are oxidized in the same way.

Kachler, however, has recently found (Ann. Ch. Pharm. clix. 281) that the

so-called camphresinic acid from camphor is a mixture, the principal con-

stituent of which is a crystaUizable acid, C,,Hj^O., to which he gives the

name camplioronic acid ; this is characterized by giving a sandy precipi-
tate on boiling a neutral solution of its ammonium salt with barium chlo-

ride, from which pi'ecipitate the acid is obtainable.

On boiling hesperidene with from eight to ten times its volume of a mixture

of nitric acid diluted with its own bulk of water, a vigorous reaction sets in

red fumes and carbonic acid are copiously evolved, and after some time a brown

resinous substance is formed, which on further treatment with stronger acid

mostly becomes soluble : a small quantity of yellow resinous substance is,

however, left, much resembling the crude terephthalic acid obtained by the

similar treatment of nutmeg-oil ; this substance mostly dissolves in ammonia

but on digesting the dark solution with purified animal charcoal, the whole is

gradually absorbed, nitric acid finally giving no precipitate whatever in the

Afiltrate.  portion of the filtrate was precipitated before the total absorption

had taken place ; the trifling amount of flakes obtained gave numbers on

combustion very far from those required for terephthalic acid, and nearly the

same as those given by the yellow resinous substance before treatment with

ammonia and animal charcoal.

From this it is inferred that the yellow resin was not terephthalic acid, and
that this body is not produced by the oxidation of hesperidene by nitric acid
(nor was it formed with chromic liquor as described in the last section).

Even had this yellow resin been pure terephthalie acid it would not have

amounted to more than 0"3 per cent, of the hydrocarbon used.

The nitric-acid solution was evaporated to drj'ness, the residue ueutralized

by ammonia, and barium nitrate added in the cold ; a copious precipitate

of oxalate was obtained, from which pure oxalic acid and calcium and silver

oxalates were procured and analyzed. The filtrate on boiling gave a trifling

sandy precipitate, which was nothing but oxalate ; no trace of Kachler'a
camphoronic acid could be detected.

The filtrate was precipitated by lead acetate, the copious pi-ecipitate well

washed and decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, and the evaporated solu^

tion thus obtained extracted with ether ; after evaporation a yellow sour

syrup was obtained, which, on standing for several months over sulphuric

acid, refused to deposit crystals, but gradually thickened, and finally became

a semisolid mass much resembling soft toffy : no crystals could be obtained by

pressure in blotting-paper. On combustion this gave numbers indicating

approximately the formula C^^H^gOj^, but differing considerably from those

required for either camphresinic or camphoronic acids. Converted into cal-

cium salt a gummy salt was obtained, which, after drying at 160°, contained

18-1 to 18-5 of calcium. On dissolving this in water and precipitating by

alcohol a calcium salt was thrown down resembling the original one in aU

respects, but containing 20-8 per cent, of calcium after drying at 160°. From

this it appears that the syrupy toffy-like acid was a mixture. The isolation

of the constituents of this mixture has not j'ct been finished.

   On treating the 163°-1G4° nutmcg-terpene in the same way, precisely

similar results were obtained, with this difference, that the brown resinous

product formed after the action had gone on for a short time was converted,

by longer treatment, into a yellow resin, which, after purification by solution

in ammonia, treatment with animal charcoal, and precipitation of the nearly

decolorized solution by nitric acid, furnished a mixture of toluic and tereph-

thalie acids. In one carefully conducted quantitative experiment, 105-8

grammes of pure hydrocarbon gave 14-0 of a mixture which, on analysis, ap-

peared to contain the acids in the proportions denoted by 40^11^0^ -l-C^H^O^

i. e. the mixture was 13-2 per cent, of the hydrocarbon. In other experiments,

with the mixture of hydrocarbons boiling below 180° contained in the nut-

meg-oil, 17 to 18 per cent, of a mixture of C^H^O, and C^HyOj in nearly

equal proportions was obtained.

It was found difficult to separate completely the toluic and terephthalie

acids by boiling water or alcohol, in which the latter is much the least soluble
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but approximately pure specimens of each acid were isolated and recognized

by combustion, properties, and preparation of barium salts.

The nitric-acid solution was found to contain oxalic acid, recognized by its

properties and the analysis of its calcium salt ; this was separated, and the

filtrate treated in the manner above described ; finally a syrupy toffy-hke

acid was obtained, much resembling that from hesperidene. This gave

numbers  agreeing with  the  formula  Cj^Hj^O^                                               on  conversion  into  calcium

In order to add on hydrogen to hesperidenc, this crude hj^driodide was

heated with phosphorus and water in a scaled tube at 130°-150°. Much

phosphine and phosphonium iodide were produced, and several times the tubes

exploded ; a polymeride of Cj^Hj^,, however, was the sole resulting organic

substance.

The same result was obtained on boiling with phosphorus the crude

hydriodide, an inverted condenser being attached. After some time the con-

raised about 75°, Gladstone has shown that Cj.H,, polymerides boil near

250° ; the analysis indicates rather a subtraction than an addition of hydro-

gen, 0,-^23 requiring carbon 88*7, hydrogen 11-3.
   In the hope of obtaining a C^^ acid, the hydriodide was boiled with alcohol

and silver cyanide for several hours ; silver iodide was copiously produced,

and the liquid acquired a peculiar odour recalling that of the nitriles.

   On boiling with alcoholic potash, ammonia and methylamine were given off,

a thick brown carbonized resin was formed, and, in very small quantitj', the

potash salt of an acid soluble in ether ; this acid gave a yellowish-white floc-

culent precipitate with lead acetate : just sufficient of this lead salt was ob-

tained for one determination, which gave lead =o-i-G per cent. Probably

this was a basic salt ; the anticipated reactions

   It is proposed to examine further tlie questions of the synthesis of acids from
the different terpenes, by means of the hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bro-
mide compounds.

 --Appendix. Since the reading of the above Beport, some further experi-

ments have been made on the existence of cymene as a natural constituent
of what have been hitherto considered to be pi;re terpenes : by treating

such terpenes with sulphuric acid, the C,nIIj,, constituents are polymerized,
whilst cymene, if present, is mainly unaltered and can be obtained by dis-

tilling the acid liquor in a current of steam. By these means it has been

found that the lowest-boiling nutmeg-h3-drocarbon actually does contain
cymene ; also that cymene is present in ordinary oil of turpentine ; on the
other hand, no trace of cymene is contained in hespcridene, a fact the more
remarkable as ])ure cymene is obtainable in quantity by heating the product
of the action of bromine on hcsperidenc, viz. Cj,JIjJ]r^, which splits up thus

                           +C,,,II,3Br,=2IIBr C,,,II,,.

Apparently the eymeno thus produced, that precontained in nutmeg-oil and

oil of turpentine, that derived from camphor and various other varieties now

undergoing examination are identical,

St. Mary's Hospital, Feb. 28, 1873.

Report of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. Canon Tristram,
   Professor Newton, H. E. Dresser, J. S. Harting, and the

   Rev. A. F. Barnes, appointed for the jmrpose of continuing the
   investigation on the desirability of establishing a " Close Time " for

    the preservation of indigenous animals.

1. Bblievixg that the time had come for advantageonsly urging the Legis-
lature to take further action whereby the objects for which your Committee
was appointed might be promoted, your Committee, after due consideration,
prepared a Bill, intituled an Act for the Protection of Wild Fowl, which
being entrusted to the care of Mr. Andrew Johnston, M.P., was by him.
Colonel Toraline, M.P., and Mr. Brown, M.P., brought into the House of

Commons on February 15th, and read the first time.
   2. This Bill was based entirely on the ' Sea-Birds' Preservation Act ' of

1869, and, mutatis mutandis only, strictly followed the provisions of that Act,
which experience has shown to have fully effected the object for which it was
passed, and to have given very general satisfaction to the country at large.

   3. On the motion for the second reading of the Bill in the House of Com-

mons, June 12th, the Hon. Auberou Herbert, M.P., proposed as an amend-
ment that it was " desirable to provide for the protection of all wild birds
during the breeding-season ; " but this amendment, which would have been
fatal to the Bill, was withdrawn ; the BiU was read a second time and ordered

to be committed, June 21st.

   4. In the debate in the House of Commons on the notice for going into

Committee, Mr. Herbert moved, according to notice, " That it be an instruc-

tion to the Committee that they have power to extend the protection, given

under the Bill to Wild Fowl during the breeding-season, to other wild birds."
The House divided : Ayes 20, Noes 15 ; and thereupon Mr. Herbert moved
a number of other amendments of which he had given notice ; and these being
accepted by the House, the Bill, instead of being the moderate measure con-
templated by your Committee, became one of general and indefinite scope.

   5. By this means the fate of the Bill, which had hitherto met with no
serious opposition, was rendered very uncertain, and notice was given of a

motion to throw it out ; but on the report being taken, the Bill, on Mr. John-

ston's proposal, was referred to a Select Committee, by whom it was still

further modified, the objections xirged against its sweeping clauses being over-

come by limiting its effects to certain kinds of birds named in a Schedule,
                                ;

       ON FOSSIL CRUSTACEA.     321

       while the penalties for its infringement were diminished. In this form it
       went back to the House of Commons, and with a few other alterations finally
       passed that House, and was sent to the House of Lords.

r 6. In the Upper House charge of the BiU was taken by the Earl of Malmes-
       bury, and, some fault being found with it, its provisions were further altered in
        Committee, a person convicted of a first offence being rendered Liable to a repri-
      mand and the payment of costs and summons only. Thus modified it was re-
      turned to the House of Commons, and has since received Her Majesty's assent.
          7. Tour Committee caunot look with unmixed favour on this measure. It
      appears to them to attemj)t to do too much, and not to provide eff'ectual means
       of doing it. In their former Heports they have hinted at, if not expressed,
       the difiioulty or impossibility of passing any general measure, which, without

       being oppressive to any class of persons, should be adequate to the purpose.
      Further consideration has strengthened their opinion on this point. They

      fear that the new Act, though far from a general measure, will be a very

       inefficient check to the destruction of those birds, which, from their yearly
       decreasing numbers, most require protection, its restraining power having
      been weakened for the sake of protecting a number of birds which do not
      require protection at aU. Your Committee have never succeeded in obtain-

      ing any satisfactory evidence, much less any convincing proof, that the num-
     bers of small birds are generally decreasing in this country. On the con-
      trary,- they believe that, from various causes, many if not most species of
      small birds are actually on the increase. They are therefore of opinion that

       an Act of Parliament proposing to promote their preservation is a piece of
       mistaken legislation, and is mischievous in its effect, since it diverts public

       attention from those species which, through neglect, indifference, custom,
      cupidity, or prejudice, are suffering a persecution that will in a few years
      ensure their complete extermination. At the same time your Committee are

     glad to state that such protection as is afforded by the new Act will be ex-

      tended to the particular group of birds which in former Reports they have
      shown to require it most, all the Wild Fowl named in the Bill prepared by
       your Committee having been included in the schedule of the Act. It is also
      gratifying to your Committee to find that the principle of a " Close Time "
      for all birds has been admitted by the House of Commons, though the appli-

      cation of that principle may at present be inexpedient. Tour Committee

       therefore trust that the Act will not be otherwise than beneficial in its results

      and though greatly indebted to many noblemen and gentlemen for the assis-

       tance they have rendered, your Committee cannot refrain from especially
      thanking Mr. Andrew Johnston for the skill and patience he has shown in
      the conduct of the BiU introduced.

         8. Tour Committee respectfully suggest that they may be reappointed.

 o'jTwo doubtful species of Eurypterus, namely E. mammatus, from theCoal-
ineasures near Manchester, and E. ferox, Coal-measures, Coalbrookdale and
Staffordshire Coal-field, have been examined critically ; and with regard to
j^l onammatiis, I have also had the great advantage of the assistance and rare

P^laeobotanical knowledge of my colleague, Mr. "W. Carruthers, P.R.S.

   A careful examination of the original specimens of E. mammatus has

enabled me to show that four out of the six specimens known and referred

by the late Mr. Salter to the genus Euryptems are plant-i-emains, referable
to the genus Ulodendron or to fragments of a large Equisetaceous plant,
and that the two remaining parts appear to belong to Jordan and Von
Meyer's genus Arthropleura, a nondescript crustacean (or, more probably, a
gigantic arachnid), only known at present by a series of obscure frag-
mt^i^ts from Saarbruck, £rom Manchester, and from Camerton CoUiery, near

l^ristol.

 ^.J^e ornamentation as weU as the form of these pieces are totally unlike
any known Euryjjterus.

   Of Eurypterus ferox I am now able to state that it is not a Eurypterid,
ttutf-^s referable to Messrs. Meek and Worthen's American genus Euplioheria,
audithat it is a gigantic Mybiopod, much larger than our largest tropical

  living species of Julus or Centipede. This is the second species of Myriopod
  occurring in the Coal-field of Illinois, U.S., which has since also heen obtained
  in England.

     Of the Merostomata only the suborder Xiphosura remains to be mono-
 graphed, a task which I hope to complete during the present year.

     At the beginning of this year I was requested by Robt. Etheridge, .Jun.,

 Esq., F.G.S. (of the Geological Survey of Scotland), to examine some speci-

 mens of Ceratiocaris from Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire. Among them was
 one to which he specially drew my attention, as it presented the novel appear-

 ance of appendages on the underside of the caudal series of segments. These
 consist of giU-like plates depending freely from each segment. They are no
 doubt analogous to those seen in Nehalia, which are supplementary abdominal
 giU-feet. The discovery of these organs by Mr. Etheridge, which occur also

 in several other specimens, does not in any way alter the position of Ceratio-

 caris, but renders our knowledge of it more complete.

    Since Mr. Salter's paper " On Peltocaris, a new genus of Silurian Crus-

 tacea," was published in 1863 (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xix. p. 87), I
 announced a second genus, Discinocaris, in 1866 (see Quart. Journ. Geol.
 Soc. vol. xxii. p. 503), also from the Llandeilo flags of Dumfriesshire.
 Mr. Charles Lapworth, Mr. J. Wilson, Mr. Robert Michie, and others have
 added several fine examples of this type of Phyllopodous Crustacea. The

largest of these is a portion of a carapace from Dobb's Linn, Moffat, Dum-

 friesshire, and appears to agree best with Discinocaris ; but instead of being
 a carapace the size of a threepenny piece, like Discinocaris Browniana, de-

scribed by me in 1866, this specimen, with its characteristic markings, gives

evidence of an individual 7 inches in diameter. Another specimen of this
same gigantic Phyllopod was obtained from Moffat by Robert Etheridge, jun.,

Esq., F.G.S. , of the Geological Survey of Scotland.

   An entire carapace (of which three examples have been obtained), from the
Riccarton Beds, Yads Lynn, near Hawick, makes us acqiiainted with a new
genus, for which the name AjitycJiopsis is proposed.

    It measures 1| in. in length and 1| in. across.
    The nuchal suture is straight (not semicircular, as in Peltocaris), and it has
a well-marked dorsal suture, which again separates it from Discinocaris, in
which the dorsal suture is absent.
    I name this species Aptychopsis Wilsoni, after its discoverer.
    Another and more oval-formed but equally perfect carapace of a smaller

species, from the Moffat Anthracitic Shales, measuring 8 lines long by 7 lines
broad (having the triangular cephalic plate in situ), 1 have named AptycJiopsis

Lapivortlii, after Mr. Lapworth, who has devoted so many years to the inves-

tigation of the geology of Galashiels and the suiTounding district.

  A third species, very distinct from the foregoing two, obtained from the

Buckholm Beds (which is finely striated concentrically, and is 7 lines in dia-
meter), I have named ApitycJiopsis glahra.

    There are several other examples from this rich locality, including speci-
mens of Peltocaris aptyclioides, species of Dithyrocaris, Ceratiocaris, and
portions of the scale-marked integument of Pterygotus.

   I have lately received from Mr. Thomas Birtwell, of Padiham, Lancashire,
two specimens of a new Limuloid crustacean, in which all the thoracico-
abdominal segments are welded together into one piece, as in the modern
Limulvs, but without any trace of segmentation along the margin.

   The head-shield is also smooth, the compound eyes are small, but the larval
ocelli are very distinctly seen, and are almost as large as in the modern king

                                                                            z2

crabs. The specimen is only 8 lines wide and 8 long ; it is remarkably
convex in proportion to its size. I have named it after its discoverer Prest-
wichia Birtwelli (see Geol. Mag. 1872, vol. ix. p. 440, pi. 10. figs. 9, 10).

   Another new Limuloid crustacean, specimens of which have been obtained

from the Dudley Coal-field, and also from Coalbrookdale, has the five thoracic
segments free and movable (as in BelUnwus bellidus of Konig), but the
pleurse are bluntly acuminate, not finely pointed, as in B. hellulus, and
the head-shield is not armed with long and pointed cheek-spines, as in that

species.

   I propose to name it BeUimirus Konigianus, after the distinguished author
of the ' Icones Fossilium sectiles,' formerly Keeper of the Mineral and Fossil
Collections in the British Museum (see Geol. Mag. 1872, vol. ix. p. 439,

pi. 10. fig. 8).

   Of foreign Palaeozoic Crustacea, a remarkable new Tribolite (obtained by
Dr. W. G. Atherstone, of Gi-aham's Town, Cape Colony), from the Cock's-
comb Mountains, South Africa, deserves to be noticed here. It is a new and

elegant species of Encrinurus (measuring 3 inches in length), preserved in
the centre of a hard concretionary nodule, which has split open, revealing the
TrUobite itself in one piece and a profile of it on the other. The profile
shows that each of the eleven free body-seg-meuts was armed with a pro-
minent dorsal spine nearly half an inch in length, whUst the pygidium was

similarly terminated by an even longer spine, slightly recurved at its extre-
mity, and all of the spines annulated, as if composed of a large number of
joints. Encnnuri with two (and in one case even with three) dorsal spines
have been obtained in considerable numbers, both at Dudley and Malvern,

and may be seen in Dr. Grindrod's collection, and in the British Museum and
many other places ; but a Trilobite with such an array of long dorsal spines as

is presented by this African species is very remarkable, and for an Encrinu-
rus quite urdque. I have named it after its locality E. crista-galli, which

is doubly appropriate (see Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxix. p. 32).

   Among the specimens sent me up by Mr. BirtweU from Lancashire, from

the Ironstone of the Coal-measures (so rich in organic remains), was one not

referable to the Crustacea.

   On examination it proves to be a new and very remarkable Arachnid,

referable to the same genus as one described by Mr. Samuel Scudder, of
Boston, U.S., from the Illinois Coal-field, under the name of Architarbus

(see Meek and Worthen's Report on the Geology and Palasontology of

Illinois).

   I have named it Architarbus subovalis (see Geol. Mag. 1872, vol. ix.

p. 385, pi. 9)-

                 ..  .

This is the second British Arachnid I have lately obtained from the Iron-

--stone of the Coal-measures.
   Tertiary Crustacea. Some time since I described two new forms of Crabs *
from the Lower Eocene, Portsmouth, discovered by Messrs. Meyer and Evans
in the excavations for the new Docks there. More recently I have received

a fresh series, from which I have been enabled not only to refigure and to

fuUy describe the species named by me (on December 21, 1870) Rhachio-

soma bispinosa, and to show both the upper and under side of the male and
female, but also to record two additional forms, for which I propose the genus
Litoricola, naming them respectively L. glabra and L. dentata. These do

not belong (like Bhachiosoma) to the Portunidae, but to the Ocypodidae, or

   * Bhachiosoma bispinosa and E. echinata (see Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. 1871, vol.

xxvii. p. 91, pi. 4),

true shore-crabs, their legs being adapted for ruiming, and their eyes
furnished with long peduncles* (see Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxix.

p. 28).

    This series of Crustacea (though they are exceedingly brittle and delicate)
are remarkable for the perfect state of preservation in which they occur, so

that we are able in each case to restore nearly the entire animal. Of the
two new ones, it is interesting to record that they afford evidence of unmis-

takable land conditions, both of them being shore-dwellers and adapted for
running on the old muddy and sandy beaches of the pre-Eocene continent.
The sections still, I believe, open at Portsmouth deserve an inspection from

--all who are interested in the stratigraphical geology of this series of deposits.
   Miocene Crustacea. Having been requested by Dr. A. Leith Adams, P.E..S.,
to examine and describe a series of crustacean remains from the Miocene of
Malta, collected by him in that island, I have done so, and find them to in-
clude Scylla, Baniiia, Portunites, Main, Atergatis, and perhaps Nepiumis.

The Scylla agrees specifically wth the Scylla serrata found in the Indian

seas of to-day and in the Tertiaries of the Philippine Islands. This is one
of the species of fossil crabs so largely imported into China as " Medicine-
Crabs " (see Mr. D. Hanbury's papers read before the Pharmaceutical Society,
and published in their Journal, Pebruary 1862 et seq.).

    The Eanina is distinct from any recorded species, and I have therefore to
propose for it a specific name. I dedicate it to its discoverer {R. Adamsi).

   The occurrence of these Eastern forms, with the remarkable Echinoderms
of Asiatic type, in Malta, clearly indicate the former extension of an Indian
fauna as far east as the Mediterranean, if not to our own shores.

   Whilst still pursuing the subject of the structure of the Trilobites, no new
facts have been collected ; but much has been done in the examination of

larval Limulus, the substance of which I have summarized in a paper read
in December last before the Geological Society (see Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.

vol. xxviii. p. 46),

    Dr. Anton Dohrn, without (as I think) any very clear reason, proposes to
separate the XirnosuEA and the Euetpteeida, and also the Teilobita, from

the Crustacea, on the ground that they do not, so far as we are at present

aware, pass through aNauplius stage ; but the young are like the parents save

in the fewer niimbcr of their somites. He is, however, unprepared to say they

are Arachnids, so that he can only place them in a group intermediate between
the Arachnida and Crustacea (the Gigantostraka of Hack el). Against this
course I have protested on the grounds that if Ave take away the Trilobita from
the pedigree of the Crustacea, one of the main arguments in favour of evolution
to be derived from this class, so far from being strengthened, is destroyed.

From what are the Crustacea of to-day derived ? Are we to assume that they

are all descended from the Phyllopods and Ostracods, the only two remaining
orders whose life-history is conterminous with that of the Trilobita ? Or are

we to assume that the Arachnida are the older class ? " If," as Fritz Miiller

well observes, " all the classes of the Arthropoda (Crustacea, Insecta, Myrio-

poda, and Arachnida) are indeed all branches of a common stem (and of this

there can scarcely be a doubt), it is evident that the water-inhabiting and water-
breathing Crustacea must be regarded as the original stem from which the
other (terrestrial) classes, with their tracheal respiration, have branched off."
(Facts and Arguments for Darwin, p. 120.)

   * Under the name of Gonwcypoda Edwardsii, I desevibed a true Eocene shore-crab
from tlie Eed Marl of the Plastic Clay, High Cliff, Hampshire, in December 1867 (see
Geol. Mag. vol. iv. p. 529, pi. 21. fig. 1).
326 REPORT 1872.
ON THE SOLAR ECLIPSE OT DEC. 12, 1871.  327

   The accompanying Table (p. 326) is merely intended as an attempt roughly
to indicate (according to our present knowledge of the earliest appearance in
time of the several orders of Crustacea) the most probable manner in which the
various groups were evolved from a common pre-Cambrian parent-stock. I
have specially distinguished those which are merely persistent types, but
incapable of modification, from those which were capable both of persistence
and modification ; and these again from the inadaptive types which have died
out. The aberrant and highly speciahzed parasitic types appear last in time,
and mark the culminating point of the Crustacea when conditions prevailed
more highly favourable to the class than at any earlier period.

    Report of the Committee appointed to organize an Expedition for
                     observing the Solar Eclipse of Dec. \2, 1871.

At their Meeting in Edinburgh in August last, the General Committee of the

British Association for the Advancement of Science having had under their
consideration the great importance of observing the ecUpse of 12th of De-

cember, 1871, authorized their President, Sir W. Thomson, E.E.S., to bring

the matter to the notice of the Treasury, which he did in a letter dated 9th

August, 1871, stating fully how desirable it was in the interest of science

that advantage should be taken of this opportunity to advance solar physics,
and explaining in general terms the best methods of carrying them out.

   It was suggested in the President's letter that Mr. J. Norman Lockyer,
F.R.S., who had long devoted himself to spectroscopic investigations, should
form a member of the expedition.

   The President was authorized by Sir E. Sabine, K.C.B., President of the
Eoyal Society, and Mr. Lassell, President of the Eoyal Astronomical Society,

to state to the Treasury their cordial concurrence in the request of the

British Association.

   A most prompt reply was received to their communication, the Treasury,

by a letter dated 16th August, 1871, acceding at once to the request of the
President, and granting a sum not exceeding £2000 for the purpose.

    In the hope of a favourable reply being received from the Treasury, the
General Committee had, by a resolution at their last Meeting in Edinburgh,
authorized the General Officers to take such steps as they might deem advisable
as soon as possible after the receipt of the Treasury letter. The General
Officers held a meeting on the 22nd of August; and having in the first

instance requested Mr. Norman Lockyer, F.E.S., to join them in consulta-

tion, they resolved to appoint a Committee to direct all the necessary

arrangements.

   To this Committee, as originally constitiited, additional members were from

--time to time added. It now consists of the following names : The President

and General Officers of the Association, Prof. J. C. Adams, Sir G. B. Airy
(Astronomer Eoyal), Prof. Clifton, Mr. De La Rue, Dr. Frankland, Mr. Hind,
Mr. .Lassell (President E.A.S.), Lord Lindsay, Mr. Lockyer, General Sabine,
General Strachey, Colonel Strange, and Prof. Stokes.

   The Treasury having been good enough to address the Admiralty and the

War Office requesting their cooperation, the Committee entered into com-

munication with these departments and with the Colonial and Indian Officers,

and have much pleasure in stating that they have had the most liberal and

hearty assistance from all the departments of Government.
    The first duty of the Committee was to arrange for the dispatch of instru-

ments and instructions to Australia, which it was necessary to do by the mail
of the 2nd of October.

   By Mr. Lockyer's exertions, and the kindness of Mr. Huggins in making

over a camera of Mr. DalLmeyer's, which the Committee undertook to replace
within a month, these instruments were all sent off in good time, and reached
Melbourne with little or no damage.

    The unfortunate result of the expedition to Australia, from bad weather,
is well known and deeply regretted, and need only be briefly mentioned.

    The Committee now turned their attention to the selection of the places
best adapted to observation in India. Very careful inquiries were made from

every available source as to the nature of the climate in different parts of
India on the 12th of December, and in these the Committee received most
valuable assistance from General Strachey.

    The season was about the middle of the north-east monsoon, making it
probable that there would be fine weather on the west coast of the peninsula,
but that the weather on the east coast and in Ceylon could not be depended
upon, the rainy season breaking up in December, but sometimes early in the

month, but at other times not till nearly or quite the end.
    It was originally intended to fix the number of observers at five ; hut on

further consideration it appeared to the Committee that, because of this un-

certainty of weather, it was desirable to divide the expedition into as many

 parties as possible ; with the very important assistance mentioned in the
next paragraphs, they were of opinion that it would be feasible, by means of
the Treasury grant, to purchase the necessary instruments and to provide
passage-money for ten observers.

    The Peninsular and Oriental Company, at the request of the Committee,
made the most liberal arrangements for freight and passage to and fi'om Point
 de Galle, and the Admiralty at once communicated by telegraph with Admiral
 Cockburn, at Trincomalee, receiving an immediate reply, stating the frigate
 ' Glasgow ' would be at Galle on the 25th of November in readiness to trans-
 port the party to the place of observation and bring them back again.

    The Governor of Ceylon, in the same liberal manner, not only placed the

 steamer ' Serendib ' at the disposal of the expedition, but undertook to give
 all possible assistance in officers and material which might be needed.

     After making these arrangements, the Committee appointed Mr. Lockyer
 chief of the expedition, and Dr. T. Thomson Secretary and Treasurer.

     The selection of observers was necessarily difficult. To many highly qua-
 lified physicists the length of the voyage was an insuperable obstacle ; but

 Mr. Lockyer was able to submit to the Committee the folloM'ing names :

    1. Eev. E. Abbay, Wadham College, Oxford ; 2. H. Davis, Esq. ; 3. R. J.
 FriswcU, Esq. ; 4. Henry Holiday, Esq. ; 5. W. Lewis, Esq. ; 6. Captain

--Maclear, E.N. ; 7. H. N. Moseley, Esq. ; 8. Captain Tui)man, E.M.A. all

  gentlemen devoted to and well skilled in solar physics.
     To the chief of the expedition and to these gentlemen the Committee have

  great pleasure in giving their most cordial thanks for the zeal which led them
  to undertake a long voyage with the sole object of the advancement of science,
  and in expressing their great satisfaction with the way in which the expe-
  dition was carried out.

      Mr. Davis, the accomplished photographer of Lord Lindsay, undertook tho
         --

department of Photography ; and the Committee have to express their sense of
the generous assistance aiforded them by that nobleman in supplying all the

necessary photographic apparatus.

   Mr. Holiday, a skilful artist, who had long been a student of physical
science, undertook to sketch the phenomena of the eclipse.

   To the other gentlemen the spectroscopic and polariscopic observations were

allotted under the direction of Mr. Lockyer.
    Before leaving England Mr. Lockyer telegraphed and wrote to Signer

Respighi, a very eminent Italian astronomer, requesting him to join the
party, which, by the liberality of the Italian Government, he was able to do,

joining at Suez, and rendering most valuable assistance.
    Mr. Lockyer tried further to obtain the assistance of several very distin-

guished foreign Q observers. He communicated with Mr. Young, M. Janssen,

M. Zijllner, M. Angstrom, Prof. Schmidt, and Mr. Peise ; but from various

causes none of these gentlemen could join the party.
    The expedition embarked at Southampton on the steamer 'Mirzapore,'

receiving early attention and assistance from Captain Paris, R.N.R., and the
officers of that ship, which was selected on account of its passing through the
Suez Canal, so that all risk of injury to the instruments was avoided. The
party reached Galle on the 27th of November, fifteen days before the day of

the eclipse.

    Subject to any alteration which might become needful on the receipt of
more complete information in Ceylon, Mr. Lockyer had made the following

arrangements of stations and observers :

Ceylon.  Trincomalee : Mr. Moseley.
India.   Jaifna : Mr. Lewis, Captain Tupman, E.M.A.
         Poodoocotta, near Trichinopoly : Signor Respighi, Mr. Holiday.

         Mannatoddy, in Wynaad : Rev. Mr. Abbay, Mr. Friswell.

         Baikul, in Canara : Mr. Lockyer, Mr. Davis, Captain Maclear,

                      Dr. Thomson.
   The Ceylon party embarked at once on the ' Serendib,' where they were
received by Captain Pyers, R.E., the Surveyor- General of Ceylon, and Captain

Hogg, R.E., who had been requested by the Ceylon Government to assist the
expedition, and both of whom furnished very valuable reports.

   The other parties embarked on board the frigate ' Glasgow,' whence the
Poodoocotta party was landed at Beypore, the Ws'uaad party at Cannanore,

and the Canara party at Baikul.
   The Committee are happy to state that the weather was favourable, and

the observations successful at all the stations but one. At Mannatoddy, in
Wynaad, the sun was obscured, and the regret with which the Committee
learned the bad luck of Messrs. Abbay and Priswell was enhanced by their
knowledge that the land journey of these observers was one of great hardship

and fatigue.
   The Committee are most anxious to take this opportunity of stating that

the expedition received every possible assistance from the Yiceroy and
Governor-General, the late Lord Mayo, from the Governor of Madras, Lord
Napier, and from the Governor of Ceylon, Sir Hercules Robinson, and from

all the officials of both the Indian and Colonial Governments with whom

they came in contact.
    they have further to report that the frigate ' Glasgow' not having been

able, owing to its services being urgently reqiiired elsewhere, to bring the
parties back to Galle and Bombay, the Government of Madras was good

enough to assist the expedition, which would otherwise have been in diffi-

culties as to travelling expenses from the places of observation to Galle or
Bombay, by a liberal grant of ^100.

  AIn conclusion the Committee have much pleasure in laying before Section

an interim report by Mr. Lockyer on the results of the expedition, to be fol-
lowed as soon as possible by the full report, which the Royal Astronomical
Society have undertaken to publish.

An interim Report on the Results obtained hy the British-Association Eclipse
              Expedition o/1871. By J. Norman Looktek, F.R.S.

                                 I. New Instruments.

   These were as follows :

  A1. train of five prisms to view the corona.
  A2. large prism of small angle placed before the object-glass of a telescope.

   On these instruments I may remark that the Eoyal Astronomical Society,
in the first instance, invited me to take charge of an Expedition to India

merely to conduct spectroscopic observations ; but although this request did

me infinite honour, I declined it, because the spectroscope alone, as it had
been used before, was, in my opinion, not competent to deal with all the
questions now under discussion. Thus some of the most eminent American

observers had come to the conclusion that the spectrum of hydrogen observed
in the last eclipse round the sun, to a height of 8', was a spectrum of hydrogen

" far above any possible hydrogen" at the sun. Hence it was in some way
reflected. Now with our ordinary spectroscopic methods it was extremely

difficult, and one might say impossible, to determine whether the light which
the spectroscope analyzed was reaUy reflected or not ; and that was the whole

question.

    It became necessary, therefore, in order to give any approach to hopeful-

ness, to proceed in a somewhat different way in the 1871 expedition, with

regard to the spectroscope, and, to guard against failure, to supplement such
observations with photographs.

   To understand the method adopted, let us suppose a train of prisms. Take
one prism out of the train, and consider what will happen if we illuminate a
slit with a monochromatic light and observe it through the prism. If we
render sodium vapour incandescent and illuminate the slit by means of it, we
get a bright yellow image of the slit, due to tlie vapour of the metallic sodium

only giving us yellow light. But why is it that we get a line ? Because we
employ a line slit. If, instead of a straight line, we have a crooked line for
the slit, then we see a crooked line through the prism. Going one step
further : suppose that instead of a line, whether straight or crooked, we have
a slit in the shape of a ring, we see a ring image through the prism. And
then comes this point : if, when we work in the laboratory, we examine these
various slits, illuminated by these various vapours, if we observe the corona
in the same way, we shall get a ring built up by each ray of light which the
corona gives to us, since we know, from the American observations, that

there were bright lines in the spectrum of the corona as observed by a line
slit ; in other words, the corona examined by means of a long train of prisms
should give us an image of itself painted by each ray which the corona is
competent to radiate towards us*.

   These were the considerations which led to the adoption of this new attempt
to investigate the nature of the corona now in question. It was, to use a

   * After I had thought of this arrangement, and had secui-ed an instrument to carry it out,
Prof. Young, in a communication to ' Nature,' suggested the same method of observation.

train of prisms, pure and simple, using the corona as tlie sKt, a large number
of prisms being necessary to separate the various rings we hoped to see, by

reason of their strong dispersion.
    This principle, good for a train of prisms such as I have referred to, is

good also for a single prism in front of the object-glass of a telescope. Such
-was the method adopted by Prof. Eespighi, the distinguished Director of the

Observatory of the Capitol of Rome, who accompanied the expedition.

   This method, if it succeeded, would be superior to the ordinary one in this

way. If we were dealing merely with scattered light, then aU the rings
formed by vapours of equal brilliancy at the base of the chromosphere would
be of the same height ; while if such scattering were not at work, the rings

would vary according to the actual height of the vapours in the sun's

atmosphere.

    3. Integrating spectroscopes driven hi/ clockwork.

  A4. self-registering integrating spectroscope, furnished with telescopes

and collimators of large aperture and large prisms. (This instrument was

lent by Lord Lindsay.)

  A5. polariscope-telescope so arranged that the same observer could almost

simultaneously observe both with the Savart and the Biquartz.

  A6. polariscope-telescope arranged for rapid sweeping round the corona

at a given distance from moon's limb.

                         II. The Main Resttlts.

                         Spectroscopic Observations,

   It has been established that the idea that we do not get hydrogen above
10" above the sun is erroneous, for we obtained evidence that hydrogen exists

to a height of 8' or 10' at least above the sun.
    Just as the sun disappeared Prof. Respighi employed the instrument to

which I have already referred to determine the materials of which the pro-
minences which were then being eclipsed were composed; and he got the
prominences shaped out in red, yellow, and in violet light, a background of
impure spectrum filling the field ; and then as the moon swept over those

prominences they became invisible. He saw the impure spectrum and the

yeUow and violet rings gradually die out, and then three broad rings, painted

in red, green, and blue, gradually form in the field of view of his instrument
and as long as the more brilliant prominences on both sides of the sun were

invisible he saw these magnificent rings.
   These rings were formed by C and F, which show us that hydrogen

Vextends at least high ; for had we been dealing with mere glare, had we

not been dealing with hydrogen itself, we shotdd have got a yellow ring as luell.

In addition to the red ring and the blue and violet, which indicate the

spectrum of hydrogen, he saw a bright green ring, much more brilliant than

the others due to 1474.

While Prof. Respighi was observing these rings by means of a single prism

and a telescope of some 4 inches aperture, some 300 miles away from him

(he was at Poodocottah and I was at Bekul) I had arranged the train of five

Myprisms.   observation was made intermediately, as it were, between

the two observations of Prof. Respighi's. The observations may be thus

compared :

Respighi ..CD'           GF . . . . Prominence at beginning of eclipse.

GLockyer C. . 1474 F .... Corona 80" after beginning of totality.

Respighi . . C 1474 F .... Corona mid eclipse.

333 REPORT--1872.

   I had no object-glass to collect light, but I had more prisms to disperse it,

so that with me the rings were not so high as those observed by E-espighi,
because I had not so much light to work with ; but, such as they were, I saw

them better, because the continuous spectrum was more dispersed, and the

rings (the images of the corona) therefore did not overlap. Hence doubt-

less Eespighi missed the violet ring which I saw ; but both that and 1474
Wwere very dim, while C shot out with marvellous brilliancy, and
                                                                  was

absent.

    These observations thus tend to show, therefore, that instead of the element
the line of which corresponds with 1474 existing alone just above the pro-

minences, the hydrogen accompanies it to what may be termed a great height

above the more intensely heated lower levels of the chromosphere, including

the prominences, in which the lower vapours are thrown to a greater height.
With a spectroscope of small dispersion attached to the largest mirror of
smallest focus which I could obtain in England, the gaseous nature of the

spectrum, as indicated by its structure (that is, bands of light and darker

intervals as distinguished from a continuous spectrum properly so called), was

also rendered evident.

         Photographs and Structure of Corona.

The photographic operations (part of the expense of which was borne by

Lord Lindsay) were most satisfactory, and the solar corona was photographed

to a greater height than it was observed by the spectroscope, and with details

which were not observed in the spectroscope. Mr. Davis was fortunate

enough to obtain five photographs of great perfection at Bekul, and Captain

Hogg obtained some at Jaffna ; but the latter lack in detail. The solar nature

of most, if not all, of the corona recorded on the plates is established by the

fact that the plates, taken in different places, and both at the beginning and
end of totality, closely resemble each other ; and much of the exterior

detailed structure is a continuation of that observed in the inner portion,

independently determined by the spectroscope to belong to the sun.

  This structui'e I was also enabled to observe in my 6|-inch equatorial, even

three minutes after totality was over ; and we may now say that we know all

about the corona, so far as the structtire of its lower brighter levels (that

portion, namely, which time out of mind has been observed both before and

after totality) is concerned. It may be defined as consisting of cool promi-

--nences^ that is to say, in this region of the corona we will find the same

Weappearances as in prominences, minus the brightness.  find the delicate

thread-like filaments M'hich all are now so famihar with in prominences

the cloudy light masses, the mottling, the nebulous structure, all are abso-

lutely produced in the corona ; and I may add that the fainter portion of the
ring, some 5' round the sun, reminded me forcibly in parts of the nebula of

Orion and that surrounding jj Argus, as depicted by Sir John Herschel in his
Cape observations.

While both in the prism and the G^-inch equatorial the corona seemed to

form pretty regular rings round the dark moon, of diflferent heights, according

to the amount of light utilized by the instrument, on the pliotograi)hic

plates the corona (which, as I have before stated, exceeds the limits actuallj^

seen in the instrument I have named) has very irregular {ignored hy the

--sjjectrosco2)e), somewhat stellate poles a fact perhaps connected with the

other fact, that the most active and most brilliant prominences rarely occur

there.
ON THE SOLAE ECLIPSE OF DEC. 13, 1871.  333

                                                                   Sketches.

   From the photographs, in which the corona is depicted actinically, we pass
to the drawings, in which it is depicted visually. I would first call attention
to two drawings made by Mr. Holiday, who formed part of the expedition,
and in whose eye every one who knows him will have every confidence.

   First, there is a drawing made at the commencement of the totality, and
then a drawing made at the end. There is a wonderful difference between
these drawings ; the corona is in them much more extensive than it is repre-

sented actinically on our plates.

   In another drawing, made by Captain Tupman, we have something abso-

lutely different from the photographs and from Mr. Holiday's sketches, inas-

much as we get an infinite number of dark lines and a greater extension
than in the photographs, though in the main the shape of the actinic corona

is shown.

   The corona, as it appeared to me, was nothing but an assemblage of such
bright and dark lines ; it lacked all the structure of the photographs, and
appeared larger ; and I have asked myself whether these lines do not in some

way depend on the size of the telescope or the absence of a telescope. It

seems as if observations of the corona with the naked eye, or with a telescope

of small power, may give us such Knes ; but that when we use a telescope of

large power it will give, close to the moon, the structure to which I have
referred, and abolish the exterior structure altogether, leaving a ring round
the dark body of the moon, such as Prof. Respighi and myself saw in our
trains of prisms, and I in the 6|-inch telescope, in which the light was reduced
by high magnification so as to bring the corona to a definite ring some 5'
high, while Prof. Respighi, using a 4-inch telescope, brought the corona down

 to a ring something like 7' high.

   Many instances of changing rays, like those seen by Plantamour in 1860,
were recorded by observers in whom I have every confidence, one observer

noting that the rays, revolved and disappeared over the rifts.

                                                Polariscopic Observations.

   Mr. Lewis, in sweeping round the corona at a distance of some 6' or 7' from
the sun's limb, using a pair of compensating quartz wedges as an analyzer,

which remained parallel to itself when the telescope swept round, observed
the bands gradually to change in intensity, then disappear, bands of a com-

plementary character afterwards appearing, thereby indicating radial polari-

zation.

   Dr. Thomson, at Bekul, saw strong traces of atmospheric, but none of
radial polarization, with a Savart. With the same class of instrument the
result obtained by myself was precisely similar ; while on turning in the
Biquartz, at the top and bottom of the image of the corona, i. e. near the
sun's equator, faint traces of radial polarization were perceptible for a short

distance from the moon's limb. Captain Tupman, who observed with the

polariscope after totality, announces strong radial polarization extending to a
very considerable distance from the dark moon.

                    Reversal of Lines at beginning and end of Totalitg.

   Captain Maclear, who was observing with me at Bekul for some time just
before the commencement of totality, but when the light of our atmosphere

was cut off by the interposition of the dark moon, saw a large number of very

 fine lines of difierent heights at the base of the chromosphere.
--334 REPORT 1872.

     Mr. Pringle, also at Bekul, saw many lines flash into the field of an
  analyzing spectroscope, carried by clockwork, at the end of totality.

      Captain Fyers, the Surveyor-General of Ceylon, observing with an inte-
 grating spectroscope, saw something hke a reversal of all the lines at the
 beginning, but nothing of the kind at the end.

    _Mr. Fergusson, observing with an instrument of the same kind, saw reversal
 neither at the beginning nor the end, though during totality he saw more lines
 than Captain Eyers.

     Mr. Moseley states that at the beginning of the eclipse he did not see this
 reversal of lines. Whether it was visible at the end he could not tell, because
 at the close the slit had travelled off the edge of the moon.

     Prof. Eespighi, using no sHt whatever, and being under the best conditions
 for seeing the reversal of the lines, certainly did not see it at the beginning
 but he considers he saw it at the end, though about this he is doubtful.

    From the foregoing general statement of the observations made on the
 eclipse of last year, it wiU be seen that knowledge has been very greatly

 advanced, and that most important data have been obtained to aid in the

discussion of former observations. Further, many of the questions raised by
the recent observations make it imperatively necessary that future eclipses
should be carefully observed, as periodic changes in the corona may then

possibly be found to occur. In these observations the instruments above

described should be considered normal, and they should be added to as much

as possible.

Preliminary Report of a Committee, consisting of Professor Michael

   Foster, F.R.S., Professor W. H. Flower, F.R.S., and Benjamin

    LowNE, M.R.C.S., appointed for the purpose of making Terato-

    embryological Inquiries.

Mr. Lowira reported on two forms of Incubators. He thought from his

experiments that to insure success the heat must be apphed above the egg,
and that the death of all those which he placed in an incubator heated beneath
was due to convection.

    Death took place in all these cases from rupture of the yelk-vessels between
the third and tenth day.

   Other deficiencies were observed in many embryos ; but owing to the im-
perfect condition of the incubators in use, Mr. Lowne was not sufficiently

satisfied as to their nature.

   Mr. Lowne believed he had adopted a plan of incubator, in which the
temperature is regulated by an air-thermometer and the heat is applied above,
which would enable him to arrive at satisfactory results in the course of

next year.

   Report on Recent Progress in Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Functions.

                        By W. H. L. Russell, F.R.S.

We no-w enter on the consideration of the Hyperelliptic Functions. I propose

to divide the subject into four parts, thus :--

   Part I. On the System of Hyperelliptic Differential Equations adopted by

Dr. Weierstrass.

   Part II. On the System of Hyperelliptic Differential Equations adopted by

Jacobi, Gopel, and Rosenhain.

   Part III. On the Transformation of Hj^erelliptic Functions.

   I hope to add

   Part IV, On certain Theorems not involving the Periods of the Functions,

with a Supplement to the Report.

   Paet I. On the System of Hyperelliptic Differential Equations adopted by

                                                     Dr. Weierstrass.

   We now proceed to explain the discoveries of Dr. Weierstrass. It will be

seen that the form of his hyperelliptic differential equations is different from
that assumed by Jacobi, Gdpel, and Rosenhain. The object of Weierstrass is to

solve these equations ; and the advantage of his method will be seen when
we consider that he solves the hyperelliptic equations generally, and not for

a particular case, which is aU that Gopel and Rosenhain had previously

--effected. Weierstrass assumes as follows (CreUe, 47) :

Report of the Committee appointed for the purpose of promoting the
   extension, improvement, and harmonic analysis of Tidal Observa-

   tions. Consisting of Sir William Thomson, LL.D., F.R.S., Prof.

Dratvn up hy Mr. E. Roberts, under direction of the Committee.

1. The results already deduced from the discussion of tidal observations by
the method of harmonic analysis being scattered through several succes-

sive reports, it has been thought highly desirable to collect and rearrange

them in the present Report for comparison and facility of reference, along

A"with the results obtained during the past year.       full description of

the method pursued in the reduction of the observations is first given in order

that the results may be more readily understood. The explanation is the

same generally as that contained in the Committee's first Report ; additions

and alterations have, however, been made where found necessary during the

reduction of the obsei-vations.

   2. The chief, it may be almost said the only, practical conclusion dedueible

from, or at least hitherto deduced from, the dynamical theory is, that the

height of the water at any place may be expressed as the sum of a num-

ber of simple harmonic functions* of the time, of which the periods are

known, being the periods of certain components of the sun's and moon's

raotionsf. Any such harmonic term will be called a tidal constituent, or

sometimes, for brevity, a tide. The expression for it in ordinary analytical

Aand the epoch, and and B coefficients immediately determined from obser-

vation by the proper harmonic analysis (which consists virtually in the method

of least squares applied to deduce the most probable values of these coefficients
from the observations).

   3. The chief tidal constituents in the North Atlantic Ocean, indeed in all
localities where the tides are comparatively well known, are those whose
periods are twelve mean lunar hours and twelve mean solar hours respec-

tively. Those which stand next in importance are the tides whose periods

are approximately twenty-four hours. The former are called the lunar

semidiurnal tide and solar semidiurnal tide ; the latter, the lunar diurnal
tide and the solar diurnal tide+. There are, besides, the lunar fortnightly

tide and the solar semiannual tide§. The diurnal and the semidiurnal tides

have inequalities depending on the excentricity of the moon's orbit round

the earth, and of the earth's round the sun, and the semidiurnal have in-
equalities depending on the varying declinations of the two bodies. Each

such inequality of any one of the chief tides may be regarded as a smaller

superimposed tide of approximately equal period, producing with the chief

simple harmonic notes in music approximately in unison with one anotlier.

These constituents may be called, for brevity, elliptic and decliuational tides.

--Thus we have the following schedule of tidal constituents :

vations through several consecutive years must be combined to distinguish

the two corresponding elliptic diurnal tides. Again, one of the lunar varhi-
iion tides has the same period as the chief solar semidiiirnal tide. Tliis

would be of great importance for tidal theory, were it not that its magnitude

must be so small as to be scarcely sensible. Each lunar declinational tide
varies from a minimum to a maximum, and back to a minimum, every nine-

teen years or thereabouts (the period of revolution of the line of nodes of the

moon's orbit). Observations conlinucd for nineteen years will give the

amount of this variation with considerable accuracy, and from it the propor-
tion of the effect due to the moon will be distinguished from that due to the

sun. It is probable that thus a somewhat accurate evaluation of the moon's
mass may be arrived at.

6. There are also shallow-water tides Vvhich depend on the rise and fall of

the tide, amounting to some sensible part of the whole depth of the water, or,

which comes to the same, the horizontal velocity of the water being sensible

in comparison with the velocity of propagation of a long wave through some

considerable portion of the sea which sensibly influences the tides at the point

of observation. Helmholtz's explanation of compound sounds, according to

which two sovuids, each a simple harmonic, having mt, nt for their argumejits,

give rise, if loud enough, to sounds having for their arguments (m-|-?i)^,

--{m n)t, suggests that the compound action of the solar and lunar semidiurnal
--tides must give rise to shallow-water tides, whose speeds are 2{a ij) and
--2(2y a T]). The action of the solar or lunar semidiurnal tide alone must

also (by the case m=^n) give rise to shallow-water tides. The following are

the speeds of these compound shallow-water tides which have (with one

exception not yet tried) been found to be sensible at some of the places dis-

cussed hereafter :

    One of the semidiurnal components contained in the above list has the same
period as one of the variation semidiurnal tides, and is therefore to be held
accountable for any deviation, whether of magnitude or of epoch, which the

tide of this period, calculated from observation, may show from the values

which might be expected merely from the lunar perturbation alone.
    7. The methods of reduction hitherto adopted*, after the example set by

Laplace and Lubbock, have consisted chieflj'^, or altogether, in averaging the
heights and times of high water and low water in certain selected sets of
groups. Laplace commenced in this way, as the only one for which observa-

tions made before his time were available. How strong the tendency is to

pay attention chiefly or exclusively to the times and heights of high and
low water is indicated by the title printed at the top of the sheets used

by the Admiralty to receive the automatic records of the tide-gauges ; for

instauce, " Diagram, showing time of high and low water at Ramsgate,

traced by the tide-gauge." One of the chief practical objects of tidal investi-

gation is, of course, to predict the time and height of high water ; but this

object is much more easily and accurately attained by the harmonic reduction

of observations not confined to high or low water. The best arrangement of

observations is to make them at equidistant intervals of time, and to observe

simply the height of the water at the moment of observation irrespectively

of the time of high or low water. This kind of observation will even be less

laborious and less wasteful of time in jjractice than the system of waiting

for high or low water, and estimating by. a troublesome interpolation the time

of high water, from observations made from ten minutes to ten minutes for

some time preceding it and following it. The most complete system of obser-

vation is, of course, that of the self-registering tide-gauge, which gives the

height of the water-level above a fixed mark every iustant. But dii'ect ob-

servation and measurement would probably be more accurate than the records

of the most perfect tide-gauge likely to be realized.

8. One object proposed for the Committee is to estimate the accuracy,

both as to time and as to scale of height, attained by the best self-registering

tide-gauges at present in use, and (taking into account also the relative

costliness of dift'erent methods) to come to a resolution as to w^hat method

should be recommended when new sets of observations are set on foot in anj'

place. In the mean time the following method of observation is recommended

as being more accurate and probably less expensive than the plan of measure-

ment on a stem attached to a float, often hitherto followed where there is no

Aself-registering tide-gauge.  metal tube, which need not be more than 2 or

3 inches in diameter, is to be fixed vertically in hydrostatic communication,

Aby its lower end, with the sea.  metal scale graduated to centimetres (or

to hundredths of a foot, if preferred) is to be let down by the observer in the

middle of the tube until it touches the liquid surface ; and a fixed mark

attached to the top of the tube then indicates the reading which is to bo

taken. Attached to the measuring-scale must be one or more pistons fitting

loosely in the tube and guiding the rod so that it may remain, as nearly as

may be, in the centre of the tube. The observer will know when its lower

end is precisely at the level of the surface of the liquid, by aid of an electric

circuit completed through a single galvanic cell, the coil of a common tele-

graph " detector," the metal measuring-scale, the liquid, and the metal tube*.

Ey this method it will be easy to test the position of the water-level tridy

to the tenth of an inch. It is not probable that tidal observations hitherto

made, whether with self-registering tide-gauges or by direct observations,

have had this degree of accuracy; and it is quite certain that a proper

method of reduction will take advantage of all the accui'acy of the plan now

proposed.

   9. An observation made on this plan every three hours, from day to day

for a month, would probably suffice to give the data required for nautical

purposes for any harbour. It is intended immediately to constiiict an appa-

ratus of the kind, and give it a trial for a few weeks at some convenient

harbour ; and if the plan prove to be successful and convenient, it will come

to be considered whether observations made at every hour of the day and

   [* Instead of the galvanic detector, an hydraulic nietliod may be found preferable in some
places. The latter consists in using a stiff tube of half inch diameter or so, instead of the

.solid metal measuring-bar, and testing whether its lower end is above or below the level of
the water by suction at the upper end.]

night might not, all things considered (accuracy, economy, and sufficiency for

all scientiiic Avants), be preferable to a self-registering tide-gauge.

10. One of the most interesting of the questions that can be proposed in

reference to the tides is, how much is the earth's angular velocity diminished

by them from century to century ? The direct determination of this amount,

however, or even a rough estimate of it, can scarcely be hoped for from tidal

observation, as the data for the quadrature required could not be had directly.

But accurate observation of amounts and times of the tide on the shores of

continents and islands of all seas might, with the assistance of improved

dynamical theory, be fully expected to supply the requisite data for at least

a rough estimate. In the mean time it may be remarked that one very
important point of the theory, discovered by Dr. Thomas Young and inde-

pendently by Airy*, affords a ready means of disentangling some of the

complicacy presented by the distribution of the times of high water in dif-

ferent places, and will form a sure foundation for the practical estimate of a

definite part of the whole amount of retardation, when the times of spring-

tides and neap-tides are better known for all parts of the sea than they are

at present. To understand this, imagine a tidal sjiheroid to be constructed
by drawing an infinite niimber of lines perpendicular to the actual mean sea-

level continued under the solid parts of the earth which lie above the sea-

level, and equal to the spherical harmonic term or Laplace's function, of the

second order, in the development of a discontinuous function equal to the

height of the sea at any point above the mean level where there is sea, and
equal to zero for all the rest of the earth's surface. This spheroid we shall
call, for brevity, the mean tidal spheroid (lunar or solar as the case may be, or

lunisolar when the heights due to moon and sun are added). The fact that

the lunar semidiurnal tide is, over nearly the whole surface of the sea, greater

than the solar, in a greater ratio than that of the generating force, renders it

almost certain that the longest axes of the mean lunitidal and solitidal

spheroids would each of them lie in the meridian 90° from the disturbing

body (moon or sun) if the motion of the water were unopposed by friction ;
or, which means the same thing, that there would be on the average of the

whole seas, loiv water when the disturbing body crosses the meridian, were

the hypothesis of no friction fulfilled. But, as Airy has shown, the tendency

of friction is to advance the times of low and high water when the depth and

shape of the ocean are such as to make the time of low water, on the hypo-

Nowthesis of no friction, be that of the disturbing body's transit.      the wcU-

known fact that the spring-tides on the Atlantic coast of Europe are about a

day or a day and a half after full and change (the times of greatest force),

and that through nearly the whole sea they are probably more or less behind

these times, which Young and Airy long ago maintained to be a consequence

of friction, would prove that the crowns of the lunitidal spheroid are in

advance of those of the solitidal spheroid, and therefore that those of the

latter are less advanced by friction than those of the forme-. It is easilj''

conceived that a knowledge of the heights of the tides and of the intervals

between the spring-tides and the times of greatest force, somewhat more

extensive than we have at present, would afi"ord data for a rough estimate

--of the proper mean amount of the average interval in question that is, of the

interval between the times of high water of the mean lunitidal and mean

solitidal spheroids. The whole moment of the couple retarding the earth's

rotation, in virtue of the lunar tide, must be something more than that calcii-

lated on the hypotliesis that the obliquity of the mean lunitidal spheroid is

oiilj^ equal to the hour-angle corresponding to that interval of time.

  We11. know, however, but little at present regarding the actual time of

the spring-tides in different parts of the ocean ; and it is not even quite

certain, although, as Airy remarks, it is extremely probable, that in the

southern seas they take place at an interval after the full and change,

although it may be at a less interval than on the Atlantic coast of Europe.

There must be observations on record (such as those of Sir Thomas Maclear

at the Cape of Good Hope, vrhich Staff-Commander Burdwood showed to

Sir W. Thomson in the Hydrographical OfRce of the Admiralty) valuable for

determining this very important element for ports on all seas -where any

approach to a knowledge of the laws of the tides has been made.

To collect information on this point from all parts of the world wiU be

one of the most interesting parts of the work of the Committee.

12. Another very interesting subject for inquiry is the lunar fortnightly,

or solar semiannual, tide, the determination of which will form part of the

complete harmonic reduction of proper observations made for a sufficient

time. The amounts of these tides must be very sensible in all places remote

from the zero line* of either northern or southern hemisphere, unless the

solid earth yields very sensibly in its figure to the tide-generating force f.

Thus it has been calculated that if the earth were perfectly rigid, the sura of

the rise from lowest to highest at Teneriffe, and simultaneous fall from

highest to lowest at Iceland, in the lunar fortnightly tides, would amount to

4-5 inches. The preliminary trials of plans for harmonic reduction referred

to below, make it almost certain tliat hourly observations, continued for a

sufficiently long time at two such stations as these, would determine the

amount of the fortnightly tide to a fraction of an inch, and so would give

immediate data for answering, to some degree of accuracy, the question how

much does the solid earth really yield to the tide-generating force ?

   A13. beautiful synthesis of the complex dynamical action to which the

semidiurnal tides are due, imagined by Laplace, will be used in this Report

Ato enable us to avoid circumlocution.                            number of ideal stars ("astres

fictifs ") are assumed to move, each uniformly in the plane of the earth's

equator, with angular velocities small in comparison with that of the earth's

rotation, so that the period of each relatively to the earth is something not

very different from the lunar or solar twenty-four hours. Each one of the

approximately semidiurnal tides (§ 3) is produced by one alone of these

ideal stars.

14. One of the ideal stars is what is commonly called in England the

'*' mean sun," bemg that point of the celestial sphere in the plane of the earth's

equator whose hour- angle is equal to mean solar time : for brevity we shall

call it S. Another of them might be the " mean moon " similarly defined

(called M)                                                        but, to allow the same Tables (§ Ki) to be used for the reduction

of tidal observations of different years, we shall take it as a point moving in

the plane of the earth's equator, with an angular velocity equal to the mean

angular velocity of the moon, and set at 0°-0 for its hour-angle at the com-
mencement of any series of observations J.

t=2'3 may agree as nearly as possible, on the whole, with the twenty-four
numbers of the group (the sum of the squares of the differences to be a
minimum*). The tabular forms and rules given by Mr. Archibald Smith,

and published by the Admiralty, for the harmonic reduction of the deviation of
ships' compasses, have been adopted mutatis mutandis, and have proved very

convenient.

    20. If, instead of including only seventeen coefficients, A^, A^, Bj,
A^, B^, the calculation had been extended to A,j, B^, A^,,, so as to include

in all twenty-four coefficients, the calculated values would necessarily have
agreed with the twenty-four numbers given by observation. But thei'e was
no apparent probability that any thing more than accidental irregularities and
errors of observation could be represented by higher terms than A^, B^, and
therefore these were the highest included. The following Table exhibits the
results of this process for six series, the remaining series presenting similar
features. The columns headed " diifercnces " preserve the residues, however,

and may be referred to should further study of the subject indicate that use-

ful results are to be derived from them. The greatest of them is -055 of a
foot, and the maxima in cacli column are only from -J^ to -^-^ of a foot.

possible of the mutual influence of the two largest tides, the lunar and solar
semidiurnal tides, in the two averagings performed to determine these two
tides. But the incommensurability of the periods renders it impossible to al-
together escape, in the direct synthesis for any one tide, the influence of the
others. Accordingly, the coefiicients Aj, B^, &c., shown above, are to be
regarded as first approximations in the mathematical solution of the problem.
The next step followed was to find corrections upon each summation for the
influence of the tides determined by the other summations, these corrections,
for a second approximation, being calculated on the supposition that the first
approximate values of A,, Bj, A^, t&c, already found, are correct. Auxiliary
Tables for performing this process have been formed for use along with the
other Tables (one being given as a specimen, p. 367) ; but the ultimate correc-
tions found from them, after very considerable labour, affected the terms which
represent genuine tide -components in so small a degree that their use has since
been discontinued. The S, K, L, M, N", and tides for Eamsgate, 1864, were,
however, so corrected, and the corrections thus formed are hei-e given.

   22. The corrections are to be subtracted from the values of A^, B^, A^, &c,,
to first approximation, and are as follow :

  H23. The values A^, B, in columns S and express the mean solar semi-

diurnal and mean lunar semidiurnal tides.

  KA^, Bj of column express the luni-solar declinational semidiurnal tide.

  A^, B., of columns L and IS express two constituents of the lunar elliptic

semidiurnal tide.

A^, B^ of column express zero tolerably well *.

KA^, Bj of columns             and express the two constituents of the lunar

diurnal tide.

Aj, Bj of column S express one constituent of the solar elliptic diurnal

tide.

  MA,, Bj of column express one constituent of the lunar elliptic diurnal

tidef.

  NAj, Bj of columns L and possibly depend on the elliptic lunar diurnal

tides, but will no doubt be found a better approximation to zero when cal-

culated by the average of several years. There is no tide corresponding

strictly to them.

A3, B3 are, as they ought to be, very good approximations to zero in all

the columns except M. Their values in this column constitute, probably, a

genuine expression of the terdiurual lunar tide [not included in the pre-
ceding general schedule (§ 3) but referred to in § 4], investigated by
Laplace as depending on the fourth power of the moon's parallax.

    A^, B^ express shallow-Avater tides J derived from the lunar semidiurnal
tide, according to precisely the same dynamical principle as that by -which

Helmholtz has explained the overtones generated in very loud sounds, even

when the source of the sound is a simple harmonic motion. There ought to
be no sensible tide expressed by A^ and Bj in column L ; and the comparative
largeness of these numbers is probably an accident, owing either to errors of

observation or the imperfection of the system of combination adopted, or a
chance concurrence of disturbance due to wind &c.

   A., Bj in almost every column axjproximate remai-kably well to zero ; and
even their greatest values (those of column S) express merely a deviation

^of of a foot (or 0-3 of an inch) on each side of the mean level.
   A^., B^, may be considered as insensible for every column except M, for

which they express, as they ought to do, an undoubtedly genuine shallow-

water tide, being the second harmonic (as it were overtone) of the lunar

semidiurnal tide.

A^, B^ are very good approximations to zero in all the columns.

MA^, Bjj in column             express probably a genuine, though very small,

shallow-water tide, the third harmonic of the lunar semidiurnal tide. There

is a very good approximation to zero in all of the other columns.

   It is interesting, with reference to the mode of reduction which has been
adopted, to remark to how nearly zero the comparatively large values of

A., B. in column and A^, B^ in column L of the first approximation are re-

duced by the corrections found in the second approximation explained above.
    24. Selecting from the preceding Table the coefficients, which are each

probably a genuine tide, and applying the proper corrections (Everett, Roy.

Soc. Edin. Trans. I860), which are the following :

able spaces of shallow water.

   26. In the determination of the long-period tides the mean height of
the tide for each solar day, i. e. the mean of the twenty-four hourly heights
as originally taken from the diagram-sheets, must be taken. This will give
365 means in an ordinary year ; in IcajT year the last mean must be disre-
garded, the subsequent equations being adapted for only 365 means. It
will be necessary to clear the means thus obtained of all undue lunar in-

fluence, inasmuch as the periods of the lunar tides are not commensurable
with the solar twenty-four hours. In practice the tide-components evaluated
from the series named, for brevity, M, N, and are generally found to be
the only ones which have any sensible effect. The necessary correction to

where nt is the hour-angle of the ideal star at the time corresponding to the

mean of the times for which the heights have been given. If the observa-

tions of the tide-heights have been commenced at noon, then the mean of the

times for the first day will correspond to 11| hours of that day. The values

of (nt--e) for each ideal star (M, N, and 0) having been fovind for 11| hours

of the first day, then the values for succeeding days will be found from those

of the first day by addition of the respective daily A'ariations of nt. The

first part of the formula will form a constant for each tide, and the correc-

tions are found by multiplying these constants into the cosines of the re-

--spective values of {nt e). The mean height, minus the sum of these correc-

tions, -will give the purified mean for each day. The next step is to take

the mean of the 365 purified daily means, and to subtract the purified daily

mean of each day from the mean height thus found. This will give 365 small

differences (termed hereafter ch), and it is on these differences that the cal-

culation for the long-period tides is based.

   33. The agreements between the analyzed amplitudes and epochs for the
whole of the short-period tides are, on the whole, satisfactory. The chief
discordances occur between the evaluated quantities of the lunar elliptic
semidiurnal tides L, N, X, and v. It is extremely probable that a period ex-
tending through two entire years would give a much better agreement
between these quantities, the period being more nearly commensurable with

the majority of the chief tides, the period at present selected eliminating

only that of the mean lunar semidiurnal (M) tide. The values of the mean
sea-level show a general increase, although the value deduced for 1868-69

stands out prominently from those deduced for the preceding and following
years. This uncertainty will aifect sometimes, to a considerable amount, the
prediction of tide-heights from a Jixed datum, although such results arc
better and more intelligible than predictions reckoned from low water of
ordinary spring-tides.

    34. Through the kindness of Prof. J. E. Hilgard, of the United States
Coast Survey Office, three years' tidal observations, taken at Fort Point

(lat. 37°-67 N., long. 8"-15 W. of Greenwich), San Prancisco Bay, California,

were received and analyzed, with the following results :

35. Here, again, we have an abrupt diminution in tlie height of mean level

for the first two years, which the following extract from a letter received

from Prof. J. E. Hilgard, fixUy explains :

   " The change in the mean-level reading at Fort Point is a matter of much
" annoyance to us. The tide-gauge was put up in a small building near the

Now'· end of a wharf, and the tide-staff used for comparison was close to it,

--" it was observed after the observations had continued some time that the

" wharf was settling, at least the part where the gaiige stood. Then the

" gauge was moved to a point a little nearer to the shore believed to be firm,

" but we think the whole wharf settled and continued to do so for years.

" There seems to be a bog formation underlying the surface deposit at that

" place. There is probably no way of ascertaining the amount of settling

We" except from the observations themselves.           are now having frequent

" levellings made, referring the tide-staff to a rocky ledge further inland."

36. It having come to the knowledge of the Tide Committee that the United

States Coast Survey OiRce was in possession of a series of hourly tide observa-

tions taken at Cat Island in the Gulf of Mexico, and which were of a very

remarkable and interesting character, it was thought a favourable opportunity

of testing the value of the harmonic analysis for the evaluation of the com-

ponents of the tides of this place, which appeared very complicated and pe-

culiar. Application having been made, a series of about thirteen months

Avere received through the kindness of Prof. J. E. Hilgard.

present been evaluated. Datum 10 feet beloiv datum of United States Coast

37. It is extremely intrestiug to fmd that, although the lunar and solar

semidiurnal tides are very small in value, the series of means from which

they -were obtained being extremely rcgTilar and good, the consequent deter-

mination of the phase of spring-tides (§ 50) from their respective epochs is
probably correct -svithiu a few minutes. The proportion between the ampli-

tudes of the lunar and solar semidiurnal tides is the nearest approach to

equality yet obtained, being in the ratio of 11 to 6. The comparatively large

value of Rj of Series S is undoubtedly a genuine tide, but the smallness of the

Mcorresponding value of Series must forbid the conclusion of its being purely

astronomical. It is perhaps produced by temperature or -nind, its time of

maximum being about 40 minutes after noon. There are also indications of
a similar and large annual tide of 0-27-1 foot amplitude, and maximum about

Aug. 16, which is also probably meteorological in its origin. The proportion

between the lunar and solar diurnal (Declinational) tides (R^ of Series

and P) wUl be, on the assumption of the variation of E^ of Series being as

the square of the sine of the declination, about 4 to 1

39. Professor FuUcr having applied to Mr. Parkes for a set of tide-obser-

vations of any port in India, that gentleman kindly placed at the disposal of

the Committee, for analysis, a series of personal tide observations taken at

Bombay from January 29, 1867 to June 4, 1867. The heights were observed

at successive intervals of ten minutes, and were taken under the superin-

Atendence of Mr. Ormiston, C.E.                   few breaks of short duration in the

observations have been supplied from a curve plotted for each day of inter-

rupted observation. The datum-line is 72 feet below the level of the

Town-HaU datum.

40. The observations were not used as they were given, but heights for

each quarter hour, the heights for the fifteen and forty-five miautes past each

hour being interpolated. Tables similar to those previously described (§ 16),

but adapted for the reduction of observations taken for every quarter hour,

have been made for a period of 127 days.

years ia which the moon's declination had attained its maximum and mini-

mum respectively. The peculiarity of the tide here gives rise to a consider-

ahle number of important compound shallow-water tide-components, which
has led indirectly to their evaluation at Liverpool and Ramsgate, through

this clue to their probable existence having been found. It is probable that

others besides those already found may exist, and of which a further exami-
nation of the tide-curve may indicate their periods. The epochs of the tide-

components are referred to the meridian of Greenwich, similarly to the pre-

viously analyzed tides of Ramsgate and Liverpool.

   49. It is here worthy of remark, that the larger (K") lunar elliptic

semidiurnal equilibrium-tide (as indicated above) is seven times the value
of the smaller component (L) ; but on reference to the foregoing results
it will be found that the proportion between the actual components for

English x^orts is about 3^ to 1. The cause of this discrepance has not yet
been discovered : as will be seen subsequently (§ 51), the deduced value of

the smaller component L is too large when compared with its equilibrium-

as the rigorous expression for the semidiurnal equilibrium tide-height, on the

^ =supposition of no dry land, or of such a distribution as to make  and
=33 0. By taking the expressions given by physical astronomy for -^, P, ^',

i, H, and Q, and expanding in series of simple harmonic functions of the time,

it is easy to obtain, in the form proper for the hai-monic analysis, a complete

expression for the whole astronomical semidiurnal tide-generating influence.

/ilZ^V,The terms of (3) or (5), containing the factors /'^~^°"^Yand

are, on account of these factors, necessarily very small. They show semi-

+ +diurnal constituents with arguments 2(y jj)< (solar) and 2 {y (T)t (lunar),

which have not hitherto been investigated from observation, but Avhich, for

the case of the moon, and particularly in years when i is large, may be quite

sensible.

   51. The Table on the opposite page exhibits the comparative values of

the analyzed and equilibrium-theoretical semidiurnal tides referred to the

mean lunar semidiurnal tide as unity. The epochs of all of these tides

are expressed in hour-angles of mean solar time, and are referred to the

meridian of the place, except for Liverpool, Eamsgate, and Portland Break-
water, which are referred to the meridian of Greenwich.

   52. The following will illustrate the method at present employed in the com-
parison between the actual tide-heights as recorded and the heights as
furnished by the evaluated tide-constants. The residual differences (which
include instrumental errors of every description) show the amoimt of precision
arrivedat from the tide -components included in the analysis, and are useful
as a guide for the introduction of new arguments and the consequent evalua-
tion of new tide-components. The Tables are based on the analyzed values

Rof the tide-components of Kurrachee for the year 1868-69 alone, excepting

the and T solar elliptic semidiurnal tides, which are the results of 1868-

1869 and folloM'ing year.

In order to facilitate the computations of the heights. Tables showing the

value of the tide above or below mean level for each 15° of hour-angle for
the S tide should be formed, or for a less interval if it is contemplated com-
Mputing the tide-heights for more frequent intervals than each integral mean
solar hour, and for every degree of the  tide on account of the magni-

tude of 11, of this tide, and for every few degrees for the rest of the tide-

components.

whatever. These are most readily obtained by the use of the arithmometer
of Thomas (de Cohnar).

   The residual differences, on this and the following page, arc for the most
part negative, and indicate that the mean height of the water on the day in

question was above the mean height of the water for the whole year. On

trial it will be found that the excess equals 0-15 of a foot, a quantity such

that, if applied to the residual differences, will make them all very small.

rills flowing from the higher parts of the beach through the ishingle. But

these streams are rills and not torrents, as they might be expected to be

after the enormous downfall of rain ; and there is clearly some storage reser-

voir inte]:yening which has prevented its immediate discharge. This is the

chalk itself, which acts as a sponge and stores up the water until saturation

takes place, and it is obliged, as it were reluctantly, to give up what it has

lost the power of retaining.

  The problem now to be solved by the engineer is, How can this water

thus running wastefuUy into the sea be made use of for the purpose in view ?

A description of the waterworks constructed for the supply of this place will

go far to answer the question. Brighton has always been supplied with

water from wells sunk in the chalk stratum. In a description of the toM'n,

written in the year 1761, by Dr. Belhan, a physician who succeeded the

--well-known Dr. Eichard Eussell, it is stated : " The town is supplied from

a variety of wells. The water most esteemed by the inhabitants is drawn

from a well in North Street, and that preferred by the Company is obtained

at the Castle Tavern. These waters answer every domestic purpose of life

extremely well ; and as the qualities of springs of any place have been from

the time of Hippocrates to this day looked upon as a mark of those of the

air, the sweetness and goodness of spring-water here may with propriety be

esteemed a corroborating proof of the healthfulness of the air of this town."

Such wells as these supplied the inhabitants until about the year 1830,

when a Company was formed by a few public-spirited men, the late Mr.

Peter Cazalct and Dr. Tajdor, who, I believe, is still living, being among its

Amost active members, and a system of waterworks was established.  well

was sunk near the Lewes Eoad, about l:j mile in a direct line from the sea-

shore ; and the water obtained was pumped by steam into a reservoir 220

feet above the sea, and thence distributed through pipes over the town. It

was soon found that a single weU would not give sufficient for the rapidly

increasing population, and that the engines drew the water faster than the

springs would give it ; and tunnels or adits were driven in the form of a cross

for the double piu'pose of obtaining more water and of making a storage from

which the pumps might dra^v. A boring was also made into the chalk below

to a great depth, but, for reasons which will be presently apparent, without

any beneficial result. In the year 1852, in consequence of the great com-

plaints of the scarcity of water, a new Company was formed, and an Act of

Parliament obtained authorizing the construction of more extensive works.

In the following year another Act was jDassed, by which the old Company sold

their works to the new comers, and under the powers of which the works as

they now exist were commenced.

It was soon found that the wells and tunnels were totally inadequate for

the supply even of the services then laid on, whose number was scarcely half

that of the total number of houses ; and the new Company, acting under the

advice of the late Mr. Easton, their engineer, immediately on coming into

possession of the works, commenced a new series of tunnels on a principle

successfully adopted by Mr. Easton in the year 1834 when constructing works

for the supply of the town of Eamsgate, a principle, as far as the writer is

aware, which had never been before proposed. Eamsgate, as is well known, is

built on the Chalk formation of the Isle of Thanet. Mr. Easton, in making

his survey of the locality, observed that aU along the sea-coast there issued

at the base of the chalk cliffs numerous streams of fresh water running across

the beach into the sea at low water ; and he concluded that these streams

came from cracks or fissures in the chalk, and that if tunnels were driven
BRIGHTON WATERWORKS.  397

 in a direction parallel to the sea, and at about the level of low water, these
 fissures would bo cut across and the water intercepted and stored in the tun-
 nels. His conclusions were amply verified. Ramsgate has been supplied
 since the year 1836 from wells and tunnels made on this principle.

     The town of Brighton is very similarly situated. For at least 6 miles to
 the north, as many to the west, and nearly 8 miles to the eastward, there is
 a succession of Chalk Downs untraversed by any river or stream. The geo-
 logical formation is that of the Upper Chalk with flints. Throughout the
 whole of this district (with a few exceptions of no importance) there is no
 system of agricultural drainage : none is required. The whole of the rain-
 fall, except that absorbed by the vegetation or given off by evaporation, per-

--colates at once into the chalk, and has its chief outlet in the sea as before

 described, its chief outlet, because all round the base of the great escarp-

ment at the northern boundary of the Chalk Downs there flow out springs
 more or less copious, which are formed by the overflow of the great chalk
reservoir when saturation has taken place. 8uch springs, for instance, are
those at Poynings, at Plumpton, and at Clayton. They find their way into
the sea by the river Adur at Shoreham on the west, and the Ouse at Ifew-
haven on the cast. The volume of these springs, however, is but a very
 small percentage of the total quantity of rainfall, the main body of which is
 absorbed by the chalk, and by its means travels to the sea. But although

the chalk is as absorbent as a sponge, it is equally unready to give up its
contents ; and, consequently, were it not for some outlet more free and open

than those afforded by its own pores it would necessarily overflow, and the
ordinary phenomena of surface-streams would result. These freer outlets

are provided in the shape of clefts or fissures extending almost from the
surface downwards to a very great depth, which have been formed in all pro-
bability, in the first instance, and continually kept open, by the action of the

water through a vast series of years. Where the stratification of the chalk
has not been disturbed by local upheavals and depressions, these fis§ures are

almost invariably at right angles to the coast-line : each is entirely inde-
pendent of its neighbour, and forms in itself a small rivulet, which takes its

origin from the supersaturation of the chalk, and flows down collecting water
as it goes, and finally discharges itself into the sea. The sides of these
fissures are generally of the colour of mahoganj'-, caused by the infiltration of
small particles of the upper clays, and are polished by the continuous friction
of the water. The fissures vary in size, but are seldom more than a few
inches in width, and generally not more than -2- of an inch ; thei'e is there-

fore considerable resistance to the passage of the water, and consequently as
the body of the chalk gets full the pressure keeps on increasing, as shown by
the varying level of the water in the wells. The diagram on the wall shows
the quantity of rainfall of each month for the 10 years 1862 to 1872, and
also the fluctuations of the level of the water in the ,wells on the Lewes
E-oad. This latter varies, as will be seen, from as low as 5 feet in depth in

the autumn of the year 1864 to as much as 88 feet in depth in the spring of
the year 1866. Speaking generally, the maximum quantit}' of water in the
chalk is in March each year, and the minimum in October to December ; and

the curve formed by the depths of the water follows that of the quantity of
rain at an interval of four months, the highest jiart of the one curve being
nearly coincident with the lowest of the other. It follows tliat the chalk is
acting exactly as a storage reservoir, and is receiving the surplus rainfall of
the months of October, November, December, and January (when, in con-
sequence of the low temperature and the comparative sluggishness of vege-
398 REPORT--1872.

tation, nearly all that falls goes do-vni to feed the springs), and giving out in

the summer the quantity so stored. At intervals the reservoir becomes full

to overflowing, and then is seen the same phenomenon which is known in

the Caterham valley as the rise of the Eourne, and the surplus water bursts

out. This happened in 1852 in the Preston valley, when there was a con-

siderable stream running down the London Road, and in 1866 in the Lewes-

Boad valley, when the basements of the houses were flooded with the spring-

Awater.  similar boiirne or overflow occurs periodically after wet seasons

and runs down through the town of Lewes.

The course of the rainfall, in its passage to the sea, is stUl further illus-

trated by four sections, which show the depth ofwaterina number of wells,

soundings of which were all taken at the same time. Sections A, B, C give

the soundings of wells situated in lines running northward from the sea, and

Das nearly as possible at right angles to the coast-line. Section gives the

depths of several wells dug at about the same distance from the sea, along

a line niuning from E. to W. It will be seen that there is a uniform slope

in the water-level of the chalk in the former sections, whilst the water-

level in the latter is almost the same throughout. The furthest of the wells

in sections A, B, C is not more than 2 miles from the sea ; but levels taken

to a well lately sunk at the foot of the chalk escarpment, about 1 mile east

of the end of Clayton Tunnel, show that the water there stands at the height

of about 250 feet above low water, and that the line of the water in section

B B would, if produced, very nearly cut that of the well just mentioned,

which is about 6 miles in a direct line from the coast.

   Up to the year 1865 the whole of the town was supplied from the Lewes-

Eoad Works ; but in that year it was determined, in consequence of the

great demand for water, to erect another pumiDing-station on the west side.

Accordingly a well was sunk at Goldstone Bottom, and tunnels driven to the

extent of about a quarter of a mile across the valley, parallel to the sea.

Goldstone Bottom is a naturally formed basin in the chalk, the lowest side

of which, nearest the sea, is more than 60 feet higher than the middle or

bottom of the basin. The water is obtained, as at Lewes Road, from fissures

running generally at right angles to the coast-line ; but they are of much

larger size and at far greater distances from each other : whereas at the Lewes-
Road Works it is rare that 30 feet of tunnels were driven without finding

a fissure, and the produce of the largest was not more than 100 to 150 gallons

per minute, at Goldstone nearly 160 feet were traversed without any result,

and then an enormous fissure was pierced, which delivered at once quite 1000

gallons per minute ; and the same interval was found between this and the

next fissure, which was of a capacity very nearly as great. In consequence of

the great size of these there is a much freer vent to the sea, and the water

stands relatively to the Lewes-Road valley at a much lower level, being gene-

rally not more than 25 feet above low water. The fluctuations also of the water

are not great, the difference of the quantity of water being felt rather by the

imjiossibility of the pumps lowering its level than in its rising higher.

The total length of the tunnels at Lewes-Road Works is 2400 feet, and at

Goldstone 1300 feet.

ASo much for the sources of the water.      short description of the pumping

and distributing works miist now be given.

The district supplied by the waterworks comprises not only the parish of

Brighton, but the neighbouring parishes of Hove and Preston. The number

of houses supplied, which in 1854 did not much exceed 7000 when the new

Company purchased the works, had risen on the 1st of August last, when
                       --

they were transferred to the Corporation, to 18,000, The number of inhabi-

tants at the last census in the whole district was 103,000, to which must be
added, in the fashionable season, from 30,000 to 50,000 visitors.

    The area of the district is considerable, being, as nearly as possible, four miles
in length from east to west, and about two mUes from north to south. The
ground is very undulating, varying iu level from 30 feet above the sea to as
much as 450 feet. In order to avoid lifting the water higher than is neces-
sary and at the same time to jn'eveut undue pressure on the service-pipes
and fittings, the plan has been adopted of dividing the district into four zones
or services, each fed by its own reservoir or reservoirs, with its own system
of main pipes. The highest zone (at present but little built upon) is com-
manded by a reservoir containing 500,000 gallons, built at a height of 450
feet above the sea, on the Down, about half a mile north of the Grand Stand

of the racecourse.

   The next zone is called the high service. It is fed from two reservoirs
one at Park Road on the east, containing 500,000 gallons, and the other on
the Dyke Road, on the west side, containing 600,000 gallons ; both of these
are at the same level of 300 feet above the sea ; they are connected by distri-
buting mains, and give a supply to about two ninths of the town.

    The third zone is the middle service, supplying about three ninths of the
whole number of inhabitants. It draws its supply from a reservoir near
Brighton Park, containing 2,000,000 gallons, the water-level being 220

feet above the sea.

 --The remaining or low service supplies about four ninths of the whole, and

is fed from two reservoirs one above the Lewes-Road Works containing
1,000,000 gallons, and the other at Goldstone Bottom 600,000 gallons.
These are at the level of 150 feet above the sea.

   The high and low services, as already mentioned, have reservoirs at the
same level on both sides of the town, with main pipes connecting them
together. Those on the west side were constructed in 1803 and 1865, when
the western districts increased, and it was found difficult, in consequence of

the great length of the supply main, to give proper pressure at the extremi-

ties of the districts. The effect of putting them at the same level is that
during the night, when little water is drawn by the consumers, the water
pumped into the reservoirs on the one side passes through the mains to those
on the other, and becomes available in the morning for serving the houses, the
supply being drawn at an equal pressure from both reservoirs simultaneously,
the length of the supply mains being thus practically reduced by one half.

   AU the zones are connected together, and stopcocks are arranged so that,

in case of fire, the water from the upper can be let down into the lower

se)-vice mains, self-acting valves being fixed on the outlet of each reservoir
to prevent the passage into it of the water from the reservoir above.

   The total quantity of water pumped daily varies from 2| millions in the
winter to 3 millions in the summer months. The amount per head per diem
is from 17 to 20 gallons, including street watering and large consumers.

   The water is supplied both on the intermittent and constant system.

When the new Company obtained their first Act, the intention was to furnish

a supply only on the constant service ; but on buying the old works they found
themselves imable to keep up the supply in consequence of the enormous
waste of water caused by the old fittings in the houses ; and as they could
not obtain any relief in the shape of delay, but were obliged at once to give
constant service, the Directors determined to lay a duplicate set of service-

pipes in every street, so that when called upon they could give either form
----  :

--400 REPORT 1872.

of supply to every house. This was done, and Brighton is now in the

position of being able to give constant service to one house, and intermittent
to the house next door in the same street. The number of constant-service

customers now amounts to about 5000.
   The pumping-power at the two stations of Lewes Road and Golds tone

Bottom is as follows :
   At Lewes Koad there are two engines of the nominal power of 100 horses

and 150 horses respectively, the one capable of raising out of the wells
130,000 gallons per hour, and the other 150,000 gallons per hour: the
boiler-power at this station is equal to about 350 horses.

   At Goldstone Bottom there is one engine of the nominal power of 150
horses, raising 150,000 gallons per hour, and supplied with steam from three
boilers of the collective power of 240 horses nominal.

   The wells and tunnels at each station are capable of affording at the

dryest season the maximum daily supply of 3 millions of gallons.
   The engines are all on Woolfs principle, high and low pressure condensing

beam-engines, the smaller cylinder being 28 inches diameter, and the larger
46 inches, the stroke of the latter being 8 feet. They are erected directly
over the wells, which are of an elliptical shape, 12 feet across the longer and
8 feet across the shorter axis. The centre of the beam is immediately over

the centre of the well. On each side of the centre, at the bottom of the
wells, is fixed a single-acting pump 29| inches diameter, 3-feet stroke

these pumps raise the water into the low-service reservoirs above described.
Also under the beam, at the crank end, is fixed a bucket and plunger
double-acting pump, drawing its water from the delivery of the deep-well
pumps, and forcing it to the high or middle service at pleasure : this pump
is 2 feet diameter, 4-feet stroke. At the Lewes-Eoad Works there are also
two sets of three throw-pumps capable of raising 400 gallons per minute
each, and at Goldstone a horizontal double-acting pump, equal to 600 gallons
per minute, for the middle service. The highest service of aU is fed only
from the Lewes-Eoad Works, there being a separate double-acting pump

under each engine at that station exclusively for its supply.

   Thus each of the engines at the same time can pump into all the three

zones or services, and keep up the supply without any manipulation of cocks
and valves, and without altering the working pressure on the engine.

   The reservoirs are all constructed in the chalk of brickwork, without any
puddle ; they are lined with two courses of tiles in pure cement, and are arched
over with 4i arches in cement, and covered 12 inches to 18 inches deep
with soil. This arrangement keeps the water perfectly pure and cool, and
prevents the vegetation which grows so quicldy in chalk water when exposed
to the action of light and air. From the time of its leaving the tunnels at
the bottom of the wells to its being delivered into the houses it is never
exposed to any contaminating infli;ence, and is thus used by the inhabitants,

especially those on the constant service, in a perfectly pure state.

    It will be seen from the foregoing that

    1. There are two distinct sources of supply, each sufficient at the dryest

season to give the maximum quantity required, and capable of still further

development as the town increases.

    2. There are three sets of pumping-apparatus, each equal, on an emer-

gency, to the delivery of this maximum quantity in 24 hours.

    3. There is besides a reservoir storage of two days' supply, on the average,

for each zone or service.

          On Amsler's Planimeter. By F. J. Bramwell, C.E.

       [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

This machine for measuring the area of any figure, however irregular, by the

mere passage of a tracer round about its perimeter, has now been in use for

some years ; but, so far as the writer is aware, no easily intelligible statement
of its principles of action has ever been made public.

   Although no doubt the mere construction of the planimeter is now generally
known, it may enable the explanation which is about to be offered to be
more easily followed if a sketch of the actual machine, as at work upon a

map, be given here (see fig. 1).

                                                                   Fig. 1.

Assume the planimeter to be anchored by its point X, and the tracer T to

be at some place, say A, on the circumference of the area to be ascertained

Eand assume the indices on the first wheel and on the second wheel S to be

at zero, and that then the tracer T be carried along the perimeter of the

area in the direction of the arrows (with the sun), the indices will give a

reading up to four figures, which will represent square inches, to two places

of whole numbers and to two places of decimals.

This movement of the indices is eff'ected by the wheel E, the edge of which

bears upon the paper, so that as the tracer T is made to go round about the

figure to be measured, the wheel E, from its contact with the paper, receives

rotary motion, and by means of the worm-pinion L and worm-wheel u,

communicates a diminished motion (1-lOth) to the horizoiital wheel s.

402 REPORT--1872.

RThe circumference of the wheel is " divided," and it works against a vernier

at 2/; the horizontal wheel s gives ' tens" in square inches, the larger divisions

Eon the travelling wheel  "units," the smaller divisions on that wheel

" tenths," and the vernier " hundredths " of square inches. All that has to

be done for ascertainiug an area is to read the indices after the machine is

anchored and the tracer is put to the starting-point; but before it is started, to

book the reading, to re-read after the circuit of the figure has been made, and

then to deduct the first reading from the second ; the remainder gives the

area (in square inches and decimals) of the particular figure.

The foregoing being, briefly stated, the construction, the manner of using,

and the result of that using of the planimeter, it now remains to endeavour

to show, as intelligibly as possible, why it is that such an implement, by

merely foUowtng the boundary of a figure, shoiild give with absolute

accuracy the area of that figure.

Such a proposition at first sight appears to involve an impossibility. One

is in the habit of saying, and of most truly saying, that there is no fixed

relation between perimeter and area; and of saying, moreover (and also truly),

that not only is this the fact when areas of great irregularity are dealt with,

but, as regards direct proportion, it is also the fact when the most regular

figures (figures in all respects the same, except in their actual size) are under

consideration; for it is as true that the circumferences of perfectly regular

figures like circles bear no more fixed direct proportion to the areas of those

circles, unless the exact size he known, as it is true that the coast-line of

Norway, indented with its deep fjords, bears no more relation to the area

of that romantic country than the perimeter of a prosaic rectangular portion

of the United States bears to the square miles of prairie contained within it.

These things being so, it does, as has already been said, seem at first sight

absurd to endeavour to obtain from the traverse of a perimeter, be that

perimeter the most regular imaginable (and if possible stiU more absurd when
that perimeter may be the most irregular imaginable), the correct area con-

tained within it, not merely in terms of the perimeter, but in a definite stan-

dard measurement, such as square inches.

As a preliminary to the investigation of the action of an elementary plani-

meter, let the results of the moving of a plain eyhuder in contact with a flat
surface, and under certain varying conditions, be considered.

  AAssume a cylinder, as in fig. 2, and that it is intended to move that

cylinder parallel with itself in the direction shown by the arrow, over the

length .V y. The cylinder may be (1st) at right angles to the direction in

Awhich it is to be traversed, as in A'. If under these circumstances the
cylinder be moved from x io y and brought into the position as doited at A\

the motion will be entirely one of rolling, without any sliding whatever ; and

if there were upon the surface a trace {x y) of ink capable of making a mark
upon the cylinder, there woiild be found circumferentially upon it, when it
had reached the new position, a line, the length of which would be equal to
X y. (2nd) The cylinder may be placed with its axis parallel to the direction

Aof motion, as at A" ; then no roUing action would take place, but the cylinder

would simply slide endways upon the surface. The cylinder would, however,

still bear upon it the trace x y, equal in length to the distance it had moved

through, but that trace would be obviously a mere straight line in the direction

of the axis of the cylinder. (3rd) The cylinder may be in a position inter-

AAmediate between that of A' and A'"' ; that is to say, may be neither at

right angles to the line of motion, as in A A', nor parallel with the line of

A AA^motion, as in A^ but at an angle therewith, as in  In this instance,
ON AMSLER'S PLANIMETER.               403

on tho cylinder being caused to traverse from x to y, the motion will be one

compounded of rolling and of sliding ; the trace will still be made on the

cylinder ; the length of that trace will be, as before, the length x y, but the

trace will now be a spiral, which may be developed into the triangle x y z,

and the base x z will bear such a relation to the hypotenuse x y as the

m mnobase n of the triangle  bears to the hypotenuse n o. But it has been

said that in the journey from x to y the cylinder will have had a motion
compounded of sliding and of rolUng; the extent of the rolling will clearly

mbear that proportion to the total traverse x y that the base n bears to the

hypotenuse n o ; and this proportion may obviously be any thing between the

                                                                                              ^E^

  DNow let it be assumed that the tracer T is moved from C to ; the result

Mwill bo that during the motion the block will gradually pass along the

groove until the time when the tracer T has reached D ; and then, as the
Q Dlength of the rod is exactly 5 inches, equal to the length of the side C

M(5 inches), the block must have passed along the groove until the centre

N Qin that block is immediately over the point C, and the centre line of is

coincident with the line C D. If, now, the tracer T be moved along the 2

D Minches from to A, the block must move parallel with it, and the axis Q

of the wheels R, E,', R" will therefore be at right angles to the line of motion,

A Aand the wheels themselves will, like the cylinder in A* of fig. 2, have a

rolling motion, and a rolling motion only ; and thus by the time the tracer T

has reached the point A, these wheels will each have made an entire revolu-

Rtion. If, now, the circumference of or R', R" has been divided into ten
Dequal parts, and if on setting out from pains had been taken to put the

Rwheel with its zero mark to the pointer S, it would be found, on the arrival

of the wheel at A, that it had made an entire revolution, and that therefore

the index would read 10, equal 10 square inches--viz. the multiplication of

RQthe length of the radius (5 inches) into the circumference of the wheel

(2 inches).

   Now let it be assumed that the implement is to be used for the purpose of

Ameasuring another rectangle B C D, also of 10 inches area, having its sides

and ends respectively 2 inches and 5 inches long ; so that in this instance
(see fig. 4) the ends have the 5-inch measurement in lieu of the 2, and the

sides have the 2-inch in lieu of the 5. Once more let the tracer T be moved

MDfrom C to ; the block will now have only passed along the groove a

comparatively insignificant distance towards C, and the rod Q, will lie at the

angle shown, so that it will form the hypotenuse (5 inches long) of a

Dtriangle of which the base wiU be C (2 inches long). If, now, the tracer _T

A MDbe moved from to (5 inches), the block will make a similar motion in

the groove ; and when the tracer T has reached A, the rod Q wiU have

moved parallel to itself, and will be found in the position shown in fig. 5.

ABut, as has already been said when speaking of A^ of fig. 2,_if a cylinder

capable of rotating be caused to move over and in contact with a surface

when it is in a position neither parallel with, nor at right angles to, the line

of motion, and if it be made to preserve its own parallelism, the result will
be a motion compounded of sliding and of rolling, and the amount of the

mrolling will bear such a relation to the whole motion as the base n bears

to the hypotenuse n o. In the instance, therefore, under consideration the

ratio of revolution to the whole motion will be that of 2 to 5 ; therefore if the

Rzero on the wheel were brought to the pointer S at the time of setting
out from D, it would be found, when the tracer had arrived at the end A of
RDits 5-inch journey A, that the wheel would have made just one revolu-

tion, and that the figure 10, indicating 10 square inches, would present itself.

   From a consideration of the foregoing two cases, it will be seen that the

D" rate " of rotation of the wheel R, when it moves along the line A, depends

upon the length of the line CD, and the "quantity" of such rotation upon

Dthat of the line A. These two expressions, " rate " and " quantity," will

be used hereafter in the above senses.

As an illustration of " rate " and " quantity," suppose that the rectangle of

fig. 3 had only been half as long as the one that has been considered, namely

2^ inches, and had been bounded by the hue D' A' ; if, then, the tracer had
Rbeen moved from 1)' to A', the " rate" of revolution of the wheels
                                                                     <isc.

would have been one half of the total distance moved through by the tracer,
406 REPORT 1872.

because C D' (equal 2\ inches) is one half of the length of the rod Q. The
" quantity " of motion in going along D' to A' would, however, have been the

Asame as it was in passing from D to A, because D' A' equals D ; but an

                                             .M

equal " quantity " into half the " rate " will only give half the total amount,

Raud therefore the wheels would have recorded a half revolution, equal 5

square inches, thus accurately giving the ai'ea C J)', A' E. On the other hand.

assume that the height of the rectangle had been halved, and that it had been

bounded by the lines C D, D" B\ then the wheels 11 &c. in traversing from D
Dto D" would do so at their full " rate " of revolution, the line C being 5

inches long ; but the " quantity " of such revolution would only be half that

D DAvMch it was in going from J) to A, because D" is only half A, and

therefore the wheels again would register but a half revolution, indicating

Dtruly the 5-inch area of the 5-inch by 1-inch parallelogram D", B' C.

   In each of the foregoing cases it has been assumed that the index is read

when the apparatus is about to start from D, and is re-read when it reaches A.

Such a reading would be quite sufficient in the case of a rectangle where the

groove  is assumed to be in the prolongation of one of the sides (E C) ;

but under any other circumstances the complete circuit of the figure must be

made. To test this, let it be assumed that the tracer T starts from C, and that

the index on 11 is read just before the starting, and then let it be examined

D Rwhen the tracer T has reached ; it will bo found that the wheel        has

received an amount of rotation approximately that due to its ti'aversing the

Narc of the radiiis R, that R' has received a larger amount of traverse, and R"
Na still larger amount, owing to their greater distance from the centre ; but

it will be afterwards found that these amounts of revolution may be wholly

neglected, and that they will not come into the final computation, because,

Aassume the tracer T to have attained to the point and to have put into the

wheels R, R', R" the one revolution which it has been seen that traverse would

Agive, those wheels would be found at (were there any means by multi-

plying gear, as in the actual machine, to record more than the one revolution)

to have made the one revolution each, plus the varying amounts of revolution

which they would have received in their journey from C to D. But in their

Aback journey from to B it is manifest they will each of them unwind (if

such a phrase may be used) exactly the quantity of revolution which was

put into them in moving from C to D. Further, during the passage from B

to C to complete the circuit, the direction of motion being parallel with the

position of the rod Q, the axle of the wheels R, R', R", no rolling movement

will be communicated to them, as they will be in the condition of the cylinder

A A^ of fig. 2, and will merely shde over the paper, so that on the arrival of

the tracer T at C, having made the circuit of the rectangle, there will be

found in them the one revolution, and neither more nor less than the one

Drevolution, generated by the traverse from to A.

The next point to be proved is the manner in which the implement wiU

truly record if the groove  be not on the line produced by prolonging one

side of the rectangle. Let fig. 6 represent a rectangle, say 2 inches long on

D Dits side C and 5 inches high at its end A, and containing therefore 10

X Ysquare inches, and let   be a line parallel with B C, and as far removed

D A(2 inches) on the right hand from it as  is removed from it on the left

hand, and let the groove    X Ybe on the line  ; then, if the tracer T were

Rto stand at C, and the wheels ifec. were at zero, and if the tracer were

then moved along the line C B, there would be put an amount of revolution

R Yinto which would be compounded of the " rate " duo to the length C

and of the " quantity " belonging to the length C B, or 2 multiplied by 5

equal 10 inches, equal one revolution of R. But if now the tracer T be

Rbrought back again along the line B C, the wheel will unwind the revolu-

tion that was put into it, and on its return to C will be found at zero.

Having thus premised that during the passage of the tracer T from B to C

Rthe wheel will have unwound or made a negative quantity expressive of

X Ythe rectangle B  C, let the measurement of A B C D be considered. As-
                                                                                    ;

408          REPORT 1872.

Rsume the tracer to start from C, and the wheels &c. to be at zero, then in

Ncorresponding approximately with the length of their arcs about the centre

then, on the arrival of the tracer at D, the ratio for the "rale" of trace between

Rthe wheels &c, will make a further 4 inches of circumferential movement,

equal 2 revolutions, indicating 20 square inches. If, now, the tracer T be

A Emoved from to B, there will clearly be unwoimd from all the wheels &c.

the amount of motion that was put into them in ti'aversing from C to D,
and thus the wheels E. &c. will all be left with the double revolution indicative

of 20 square inches. The only side remaining to be passed over is that from

RB to C ; and if this traverse were devoid of effect on the wheels &c., as the

traverse from B to C was in the cases of figures 3, 4, and 5, then the imple-

ment on arriving at C, at the end of the circuit, would record double the

proper area, or 20 inches instead of 10 ; but in the outset of this paragraph

it was shown that the journey from B to C in fig. 6 would unwind exactly

one revolution of the wheel R, leaving therefore one revolution remaining,

Aindicating, as it should do, 10 square inches for the area of B C D.

   The next step is to show the ability of the implement to give the area

correctly of figures which are not rectangular. Assume, as in figure 7, it be

pass along the horizontal line 1 2, it will unwind that proportion of the

revolution, put in on going from C to D, that is represented by the length of

D--the line 1 2. If, now, it be made to rise from 2 to 3, it wiU have a " rate " of
revolution equal to the length of the line C  1 2, and a " quantity " equal

to the height of the line 2 3. If it now be carried along the horizontal line 3 4,

Danother portion of the revolution given by C will be taken out ; and then

if it be made to rise from 4 to 5, a further portion of a revolution will be put in,
D--Dhaving for its " rate " the length of the line C
                                                      4, and for its " quantity "

the height of the line 4 5. This may be followed through aU the steps into

which the hypotenuse has been broken up, and then it wiU be found, as is

obvious, that the sum of all the horizontal lines 1 2, 3 4, 5 6, &c. is equal

to the length C D, and that the travcx'siug of them will therefore have

Dunwound all the revolution that the passage along C had put into the

wheel E. ; but it will also be found that the sum of all the vertical Uncs

D A2 3, 4 5, 6 7, &c. is equal to  ; and therefore the " quantity " of revolu-

Htion given to the wheel will be equal to that which it would have had, had
D D --it passed up the line A, while the means of the lengths of C
D D--4, C                                                           1 2, C D

           D 6, &c. will exactly equal the half of C D, and thus the condition of

the wheel E, in relation to the index S will, when it arrives by the zigzag path

at B, be ijrecisely the same as it would have been if it had gone by the way of

C Cthe rectangle C C" B, C being half of C D. A large number of very small

Dsteps have been taken in lieu of the straight line hypotenuse B. Obviously

a greater number of much smaller steps, or an infinite number of infinitely

little steps, may be substituted, until the traverse ceases to be made along steps

Dat all, and becomes one along the slope line B, in which condition of things
Rthe wheel at any part of the traverse of the tracer along the hypotenuse

is making a revolution compounded of the "rate" due to its horizontal distance
from C, and of a " quantity " equal to the rise from D. The " quantity " re-

mains constant during the whole journey, but the "rate" regularly diminishes,

and the mean of all the "rates" is that due to the proportion that half the

D Nlength of the line C bears to T, the length of Q.

   Now if it has been proved that this elementary planimeter, no matter

where anchored, can act efficiently in ascertaining the area of rectangles and

of triangles, it is self-evident that it could truly ascertain the area of any other

figure, because tliere is no figure from that of the regular circle to that of the

most irregular boundary which cannot be represented by an indefinite number

--of straight lines lying at various angles that is to say, a circle is only a polygon

of an infinite number of sides, all equal ; and any irregular figure may be

divided into an indefinite number of sides, most probably unequal.

   It may now be said that the elementary planimeter has been shown to have

MNits pivot attached to the gnide-block working up and down in the straight

groove 0, that that gi'oove has been sketched with its axis either in the pro-

longation of B C or in a position parallel to B C, whereas in the actual

Nplanimeter there is no such straight groove at all ; but the pivot is at the
Nend of a radius rod, which in its movement causes to pass through the arc

of a circle, and that that arc may have its chord in almost any position in

relation to the line B C, and thus there are disturbing causes in the planimeter

as manufactured which do not exist in the elementary planimeter. The

answer to this objection, which at first sight appears so well-grounded a one,

is that these differences between the real and the elementary planimeter may

be left out of consideration altogether, as they really have no eflect whatever

upon the action of the implement. This can be made clear in a very fe^v

words.
        ON amsler's planimetee.                 411

Assume, as in fig. 8, that the groove  were placed at an angle to the

prolongation of the lino B C. If, now, the tracer T be carried along the

Mstraight line from C to B, the block wiU have moved along the groove

Rto M, and the wheel will be found at R' ; this will have communicated an

Ramount of revolution to the wheel 11 due to its change of position to ; the

other two wheels (R', R") will also have made movements depending princi-

Rpally on their distance from N. Such revolution of will be given without

reference to any area to be measured by the traverse of the tracer T, for that

has merely passed along the straight line C B. But on bringing the tracer T

Mback to C, the block and wheels R, R', R" will be restored to the positions

they held at the outset, and in being so restored the whole amount of revolu-

Rtion put into the wheels &c. will be unwound.

But assume that the tracer T, instead of being carried along the line C B

Aand back again, had been taken along the sides of the square C D B back

Nto C, the pivot would return to identically the place that it had before the

Ncircuit was commenced ; and whether during that circuit moved in the

groove  Das placed parallel to the jirolongation of C in fig. 3, or in it as

inclined and as shown by full lines in fig. 8, or inclined and curved as dotted

in that figure, could make no difference in the final result, because whatever

Ramount of revolution might be given to the wheels &c. by the movement

Nof along the path of the groove       (bo that groove straight or curved,

inclined or not inclined) would be taken out of them again on the return

journey along that same path.

   Three wheels (R, R', R") have been shown loose on the axle Q of the ele-

mentary planimeter ; this, as was said, has been done for the mere purpose of

illustration, to show that wherever situated they will register just the same.

In the actual machine as manufactured and sold, the position of the wheel

is about that which has been given to R., and in this position it serves to

support the hinge-joint, and is sufilciently far from the tracer T to get rid of
the danger of lifting the wheel from the paper if the tracer T were held a

little too high.

  RIt is hoped it has been made clear that one revolution of the wheel will

always express an area equal to the circumference of that wheel multiplied

into the length of the rod Q, the radius NT*.

If these elements are constant, the scale of the planimeter reading is con-

stant ; but if these be capable of variation, then the scale can be varied. Ad-

vantage is taken of this property in the construction of one form of the imple-

ment in which the length N T is made adjustable, and thus the instrument

may be readily arranged to read either French or English superficial measure.
   The purposes for which the planimeter may bo applied are very numerous.

It gives to the Surveyor the readiest means of calculating the acreage of

whole estates or of separate fields. To the Hydraulic Engineer it affords a

mode for ascertaining with ease and certainty the drainage area of a country,

or the area of the sections of rivers, an important thing when it is desired

to obtain the dimensions of numerous sections of a stream to ascertain its

hj'draulic mean depth. To the Naval Architect it presents itself as an aid in

calculating the areas of the successive sections of a vessel, and thus most

materially assists him in readily determining not merely the total displace-

ment of a vessel, but those more complex problems which he has to solve.

   * The implenient as manufactured and sold lias a length of radius of about -tp", and a cir-

Rcumference for the wheel of about 2j^f", giving 10 as the multiplication. It has been

stated in the outset (Iiat one complete revolution of tlus wheel records ati area of 10 square

inches.
--412 REPORT 1872.

To the Mechanical Engineer it is a great boon, as by its use he is enabled
rapidly and with accuracy to find the average pressure upon the piston of a
steam-engine as given by indicator diagram : all that is necessary is to
ascertain the area of the figure, then to divide that area by the length and
the mean height; the representative of the average pressure is at once

obtained.

    There are, no doubt, other instances in which such an implement is of great
use, but the writer feels it is unnecessary to adduce them in support of the

claim of the planimeter to the consideration of engineers and of meu of

cognate professions ; and he brings his paper to a conclusion with the expres-
sion of a hope that he has by the use of plain, in fact homely, description
solved the problem which he set himself in the outset, and has made it clear

how it is that the area of any figure, however irregular, can be recorded in

definite standard units of measurement by the mere passage of a tracer along

the perimeter of that figure.

MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SECTIONS.

                       MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.

Address by Warren De La Hue, Esq., D.C.L., Ph.D., F.R.S., V.P.C.S.,

                       V.F.R.A.S., President of the Section.

My predecessors in this Cliair liave addressed you on many subjects of high interest

in Mathematical and Physical Science : I do not contemplate passing in review
the recent discoveries in Astronomy or Physical Science, but intend to confine
myself, in the main, to Astronomical Photography; and in selecting this br<anch of
science as the subject of this introductory discourse, 1 think that I shall have your
approval, not only because I have given special attention to that subject, but also
because it is about to be applied to the determination of a fundamental element
of our system, the solar parallax, by observations of the transit of Venus in 1874,

and probably also in 188:^.

Nothing is so lastingly injurious to the progress of science as false data; for

they endure often through many centuries. False views, even if supported b}^ some

amount of evidence, do comparatively little harm ; for every one takes a salutary

interest  in  proving  their  falseness                                           and  when  this  is  done  the  path  to  error  is
                                                                               ;

closed, and the road to trutli is opened at the same moment.

It will be conceded that Photography, when applied to scientific observation, un-

doubtedly preserves facts. But the question has sometimes been raised, are plioto-

graphic records absolutely trustworthy representations of the phenomena recorded ?

If not, what is the extent of truth, and where are the inlets for errors and mistakes ?

Not only has photographic observation gained a wide range of applications in astro-

nomy, but in ever)' other branch of phj-sical science its help is daily more and more

taken advantage of; and although, in speaking of this art, I shall confine myself to

astronomy, the obser\ations which I propose to make may be suggestive with

reference to other branches of phj'sics.

   As an instance of the application of this art to optical physics I may in this place

call attention to the very successful delineation of the solar spectrum by Mr. Lewis

M. Rutherfurd, of the United States. In Mr. Rutherfurd's spectrum, obtained by
the camera, many portions and lines are shown (in the ultra-violet for instance)
which, while imperceptible to the retina of the^ eye, impress themselves on the
sensitive film. As a fact, lines which are single in Angstrom's and Kirclihofl''s maps,
have been recorded by photography as well-marked double lines. I will now review

the application of the art to astronomy.

   Stellar photography was for some time applied at Harvard-College Observatory,
U.S., to double stare, for the purpose of determining by micrometric measurement
their relative angle of position and distance. The zero of the angle of position was
found by moving the telescope in right ascension after an impression had been
taken, and taking a second one on the same plate ; this process gave two sets of
photographic images on the same plate ; and the right line passing through the

I8f2.                                                                                                                   1
2 REPORT 1872.

series gave the direction of the dailj^ motion of the heavens. The probable

error of a single measurement of the photographic distance of the images was found

to be +0"'12, or somevphat smaller than that of a direct measurement with the

common filar micrometer. The late Professor Bond, who applied photography to

stellar astronomy, confining himself to stars brighter than the seventh magni-
tude, discussed the results in various numbers of the ' Astronomische Nachrichten.'

No astronomer more unbiased could have been selected to decide on the comparative

value of the photographic and direct observational method. His discussion shows that
the probable error of the centre of an image was +0"- 051, and that of the distance
of two such centres was +0"-072. Adopting the estimate of Struve, +0"-217, as the

probable error of a single measurement of a double star of this class with a filar
micrometer, Professor Bond shows that the measurement of the photographic images

would have a relative value three times as gi-eat. He derived the further important

conclusion, that deficiency of light can be more than compensated for by propor-

Ationate increase in the time of exposure.  star of the ninth magnitude would

give a photographic image, after an exposure of ten minutes, with the Cambridge

equatorial.

In the reproduction of stars by photogi-aphy, recently undertaken by ]Mr. Ruther-

furd, the objects to be secured being so minute, special precautions were found to

be necessary in depicting them upon the sensitive film, so that their impressions

might be distinguishable from accidental specks in the collodion plate. To prevent

any such chance of mistake, Mr. Rutherfurd secures a double image of each luminary,

the motion of the telescope being stopped for a short time (half a minute) between

a first and second exposure of the j)late ; so that each star is represented by two

close specks, so to speak, upon the negative, and is clearly to be distinguished by

Athis contrivance from any accidental speck in the film.  map of the heavens is thus

secured, very clear though delicate in its nature, but yet one upon which implicit

reliance can be placed for the purposes of measurement. Professor Peirce aptly

says, " This addition to astronomical research is unsurpassed by any step of the
kind that has ever been taken. The photographs afibrd just as good an opportunity

for new and original in'\estigation of the relative position of neai- stars as could be

derived from the stars themselves as seen through the most powerful telescopes.
They are indisputable fiicts, unbiased by personal defects of observation, and which

convey to all future times the actual places of the stars when the photographs

·were taken."

   Mr. Asaph Hall, who shared -with Professor Bond the work of measuring

the photographic images and of reducing the measurements, has very re-

centlj' suljjected the photographic method to a critical comparison, with a view
to deciding on its value when applied to the observation of the transit of Venus.

He appears, as regards its application to stellar observations, to underestimate the

photographic method in consequence of want of rapidity ; but he admits that in the

case of a solar eclipse, or of the transit of a planet over the sun's disk, it has very

gi'eat advantages, especially over eye-observations of contacts, inner and outer, of

the planet and the sun's limb, and that the errors to which it is subject are worthy

of the most thorough investigation. The observation of a contact is uncertain on

account of irradiation, and is also only momentary ; so that, if missed from any

cause, the record of the event is irretrievably lost at a particular station, and

long and costly preparations lendered futile. On the other hand, when the sky

is clear, a photographic image can be obtained in an instant and repeated through-

out the progress of the transit ; and even if all the contacts be lost, equally valuable

results will be secured if the data collected on the photographic plates can be cor-

rectly reduced, as will be proved hereafter to be undoubtedly possible. That the

transit of Venus will be recorded by photography may now be announced as certain,
as preparations are energetically progressing in England, France, Russia, and Ame-

ricafor obtainingphotographic records. There is also a probability of Portugal taking

part in these observations ; for it is contemplated by Seiior Capello to transport the
Lisbon photoheliograph to Macao. There are at present five photoheliographs in

process of construction for the observing parties to be sent out by the British

Government, under the direction of the Astronomer Royal, Sir George B. Airy.

The Russian Government will supply their own parties with three similar instru-

future solar observations. All these instruments, made precisely alike, will embody

the results of our experience gained during the last ten years in photoheliography at

the Kew Observatory whilst belonging to this Association. Oueonly of them, namely

the photoheliograph which has been at work for some years at Wilna, is of a some-

what older pattern ; but how great an advance even this instrument is on the ori-
ginal at Kew is proved by the delightful definition of the most delicate markings

of the sun in the pictures which have reached this country from Wilna.

Hitherto  sun-pictures  have been taken on wet collodion                                                                                                                            but a question has been

raised whether it would not be better to use diy plates. On this point M. Struve

informs us that in two places (at Wilna, under the direction of Colonel Smvsloff,

and at Bothkamp, in Holstein, under Dr. Vogel) they have perfectly succeeded in

taking instantaneous photographs of the sua with dry plates.

  As far, however, as my own experience has gone, I still believe that the wet

collodion is preferable to the dry for such observations.

   Now, with reference to contact observations, which it must be remembered are
by no means indispensable as far as photography is concerned, it may be conceded

that there will attach to the record of the internal contact a certain amount of

uncertainty, although not so great as that which afl'ects optical observation. The
photograph which first shows contact may possibly not be that taken when the

thread of light between Venus and the sun's disk is first completed, but the first
taken after it has become thick enough to be shown on the plate ; and this

--thickness is somewhat dependent on incidental circumstances for example, a

haziness of the sky, which, although almost imperceptible, yet diminishes the

actinic brilliancy of the sun, and might render the photographic image of the small
extent of the limb which is concerned in the phenomenon too faint for futm'e mea-

surements. On the other hand, having a series of photographs of the sun with Venus

on the disk, we can, with a suitable micrometer (such as I contrived for measuring

the eclipse-pictures of 1860, and which since then has been in continuous use in

measuring the Kew solar photograms*), fix the position of the centre of each body

with great precision. But the reduction of the measured distances of the centre to

their values in arc is not Avithout difficulty. Irradiation may possibly enlarge the
diameter of the sun in photographic pictures, and it may diminish the size of the

disk of a planet crossing the sun, as is the case with eye-observations ; but if the

images depicted are nearly of the same size at all stations whose results are to be

included in any set of discussions, then the ratio of the diameters of Venus and

the sun will be the same in all the plates, and it will be safe to assume that they

are equally aflected by irradiation. The advantage which, therefore, will result by
emploving no less than eight instruments precisely alike, as are those now being

made by Mr. Dallmeyer on the improved Kew model, is quite obvious. If other

forms of instruments, such as will hereafter be alluded to, be used, it will be es-

sential that a sufficient number of them be employed in selected localities to give

also connected sets for discussion.

To give some idea of the relative apparent magnitudes of the sun and Venus, I

may mention that at the epoch of the transit of 1874 the solar disk would, in the

Kew photoheliograph, have a semidiameter of 19(3o-8 thousandths of an inch, or

nearly two inches ; Venus a semidiameter of 63'33 of these units ; and the parallax

of Venus referred to the sun would be represented b_y 47-85 such units, the maximum ·

^possible displacement being 9o-7 units or nearly of an inch.

  When the photographs have been secured, the microraetric measurements which

wJl have to be performed consist in the determination of the sun's semidiameter

in units of the scale of the micrometer, the angle of position of the successive situa-

tions of the planet on the disk, as shown on the series of photogi-aphs, and finally

the distances of the centres of the planet and the sun. These data determine abso-

lutely the chord along which the transit has been observed to within 0"'l ; and an
error of 1" in the measurement would give an en'or of only 0"-185 in the deduced

   * In this micrometer, which is capable of giving radial distances, angles of position, and
also rectangular coordinates, the accuracy of linear measurements does not depend on the

doubtful results given by a long run of a micrometer screw.

solar parallax. Moreover the epoch of each photographic record is determinable

with the utmost accuracy, the time of the exposure being from j'j- to y^o of a

second or even less.

Now, although the truth of the foregoing remarks will be fully admitted, it will yet

be well to point out in this place the inherent or the supposed defects of the photo-

graphic method. These defects may priucipally be comprised under the head of

Possibilitv of Distortion ; and the importance of an investigation into this source

of error will appear at once obvious iu all cases where the position of a definite point
with reference to a system of coordinates has to be determined from measured

photographs, e.specially in such a retined application of it as that which it will

have in the determination of the solar parallax.

   The distortion of a photographic image, if such exist, may be either extrinsic or

--iutriiisic that is, either optical or mechanical. The instrumental apparatus for

producing the image may produce optical irregularities before it reaches the sensitive

plate or an image optically correct maj^, by irregular contraction of the sensitive
                             ;

tilm in the process of drying, and other incidents of the process, present on the

plate a faulty delineation *.

   In general, two waj's present themselves for clearing observations from errors.

Either methods may be devised for determining the numerical amount of every error
from any source, or by special contrivances the source of error may be contracted to

such insif^nificant limits that its effect in a special case is too minute to exert any

influence upon the result. Both these roads have been followed in the inquiry into

the optical distortion of photogi'aphic images.
KewAs regards the first, let it be supposed that, as in the
                                                             instrument, thie

primarv image is magnified by a system of lenses before reaching the sensitive

plate. " The defects inherent to the optical arrangement will clearly affect every
photographic picture produced by the same instrument; and hence a method suggests

itself for determining absolutely the numerical effect of distortion at every point

of the field. Let us assume that the same object, which may be a rod of un-
alterable and known length, be photogiaphed iu preciselj' the same manner in

which celestial events are photographically recorded, the object being at a con-

siderable distance ; it may successively be brought into all possible positions in the
field of the photoheliograph, and the length of the image on the photograph may

be measured afterwards at leisiu-e by means of a micrometer. These lengths will
chano-e relatively wherever distortion takes place; but by laying down these

varyino- lenoths we shall obtain an optical distortion-map of the particular instru-

ment and tables may be constructed giving in absolute numbers the con-ectious to
                              ;

be applied to measurements of positions on account of the inffuence of optical

distortion. In this way the optical distortion of the combined object-glass and

secondary magnifier is ascertained. The chief source of distortion, if such exist,
will be in the secondary magnifier ; and in order to ascertain its amount a reticule
of lines drawn at equal distances upon glass may (as has been done recently by
Paschen and Dallmeyer) be placed in the common focus of the object-glass and
secondary magnifier. The required data are then immediately given by the

measurement of the resulting pictures of the parallelograms on the reticule. Mr.

Dallmeyer has ascertained in this manner that no sensible distortion exists in the
secondary magnifier constructed by him. The truth of the principle being granted,

Kewit was applied to a preliminary series for finding the distortion which affects the

instrument, which is not nearly so perfect as those more recently constructed ; and

the results were so far satisfactory that, instead of a single rod, a proper scale,

fifteen feet in length, representing a series of rectangles distributed over half the

radius of the field, has been erected ; and the process of absolutely determining the

Kewoptical distortion of the   photoheliograph is now in active progress, and will

be used for the new instruments to be employed in observing the transits of Venus.

   * It has been proposed, in order to obviate any possible alteration of the sensitive
surface, to use the Daguerreotype instead of the collodion process. The former, however,

is so little practised, and, moreover, is so much more troublesome, that it does not
Beam to be advisable to adopt it, especially as tlie subsequent measurements would present

greater difficulties than occur with collodion pictures.

   The second method of dealing with optical distortion aims at total exclusion of
this source of error. It has been proposed by jVmerican astronomers, who intend

taking part in the coming observations of the transit of Venus, to exclude the

secondary maguitier, and, in order to obtain an image of sufficient diameter, to

employ a lens of considerable focal length, say 40 feet, which would give an image

--as large as with the Kew photoheliograph namely, 4 inches in diameter. As it

would be inconvenient to mount such an instrument equatorially, it is proposed

to fix it in the meridian in a horizontal position, and reflect the sun in the

direction of its axis by means of a flat mirror moved by a heliostat. There can-

not be any doubt about the fact that the image so produced would be nearly

free from optical distortion, if the intei-posed mirror did not introduce a new

som-ce of error.  The difficulty  of producing a plane mirror  is well  known                                     and
                                                                                                               ;

there is a difficulty in maintaining its true figure in all positions ; there is also

a liability of the disturbance of the rays by currents of heated air between

the mirror and object-glass : moreover, with such an instrument position-wires

could not be defined with sharpness on the photographs. On the whole, greater
reliance may be placed on a method which admits the existence of a distortmg in-

fluence, but has at the same time means of checking and controlling it numerically.

   Great attention has been paid by me at various times to those efl'ects of distortion
which might arise from the process of drying. The residts to which the experi-

ments lead seem to prove that there is no appreciable contraction except in

thickness, and that the collodion film does not become distorted, provided the

rims of the glass plates have been well ground : this point is a fundamental one.
But in such observations as that of the transit of Venus, no refinement of cor-

rection ought to be neglected ; hence fresh experiments will be undertaken

to set at rest the question whether distortion of the film really takes place

when proper precautions are taken. This will be done both by the method I

have emploj'eil before, and also in accordance with M. Paschen's proposal to measure

images of such reticules as above described : tbis reticule might, as he has sug-

gested, be photographed during the transit of Venus, so that each plate would thus

bear data for the correction due to unequal shrinkage, if such were to take place.

   It has been objected by some astronomers who have casually examined solar

photograms that the limb of the sun appears, as a consequence of the gradual

shading oft", even under a small magnifying-power, not bounded by a sharp
contour ; but the measurements of such photograms which have been made during

the last ten years, of pictures taken under the most varying conditions which

influence definition, have proved that even the worst picture leads to a very

satisfactoiy determination of the sun's semidiameter and centre ; moreover an

independent examination of this question by M. Paschen gave as the result that

+the mean error of a determination is only O'OOS millimetre with a sun-picture of
+4 Paris inches in diameter ; this con'espouds to 0"'1.35, and it is nearly three times

less than that resulting from a measurement with the Konigsberg heliometer.

Nevertheless it will be seen from the foregoing remarks that I have not hesitated

to arouse your attention to the fact that Astronomical Photography is about to

be put to the severest test possible in dealing with such a fundamental problem of

astronomy as the determination of the sun's distance from the earth. An intimate

knowledge of the subject, however, and experience with respect to work already

accomplished in the Kew ten-year solar observations, inspu-e me with a confident

anticipation that it will prove fully equal to the occasion.

   So much for performances to be looked forward to in the future : now let me
briefly review what Astronomical Photogi'aphy has already undoubtedly accom-

plished.

In the first instance the possibility proved of giving to the photogTaphic method

of observation a trustworthiness which direct observations can never qiute obtain,

Kewwill render the results of our discussion of the ten years' solar obsei-vations at

more free from doubts than those observational series on the Sun's spots which

have preceded ours. The evidence of a probable connexion between planetary posi-
tions and solar activity, and the evidence which we have published on the nature

of spots as depressions of solar matter, could never have been brought forward but

for the preservation of true records of the phenomena through a number of years

while the closer agrceineiit of the calculated results in reference to solar elements

is itself evidence of the intrinsic truthfulness of the method, and gives the highest

promise that our final deductions, whicli will he completed in the course of the

ensuing year, will not he unworthy of the exertions which I, in conjunction with

my friends B. Stewart and B. Loewy, have constantly devoted to this work during

a period of fully ten years. Not only will some doubtful questions be set finally at
rest by it, but new facts of the greatest interest will result, bearing on the laws

which appear to govern solar activity.

By nothing, however, would the claims of photographic observation, as one of

the most important instruments of scientific research, seem to be so thoroughly

well established as by the history of recent solar eclipses. It will be recollected

that in 1860, for the first time, the solar origin of the prominences was placed

beyond doubt solely by photography, which preserved a faithful record of the

moon's motion in relation to these protuberances. The photographs of Ten-

nant at Guntour, and of Vogel at Aden, in 1868, and also those of the

American astronomers at Burlington and Ottumwa, Iowa, in 1869, under Professors

Morton and Mayer, have fully confirmed those results. In a similar manner the

great problem of the solar origin of that portion of the corona which extends more

than a million of miles bej'ond the body of the siui has been, by the photographic

observations of Col. Tennant and Lord Lindsay in 1871, set finally at rest, after

having been the subject of a great amount of discussion for some years.

The spectroscopic discovery in 1869 of the now famous green line, 1474 K,

demonstrated undoubtedly the self-luminosity, and hence the solar origin of part

of the corona. Those who denied the possibility of any extensive atmosphere

above the chromosphere received the observation with great suspicion but in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

1870 and again in 1871 it was fully verified. So far, therefore, the testimony of

spectroscopic observations was in favour of the solar origin of the inner corona.

   Indeed the observations of 1871 have proved hydrogen to be also an essential

--constituent of the " coronal atmosphere," as Janssen proposes to call it, hydrogen

at a lower temperature and density, of course, than in the chromosphere. Janssen

was further so fortunate as to catch glimpses of some of the dark lines of the solar

spectrum in the coronal light, an observation which goes far to show that in the upper

atmosphere of the sun there are also solid or liquid particles, like smoke or cloud,

which reflect the sunlight from below. Many problems, however, even with refer-

ence to the admittedly solar part of the corona, are unsettled. The first relates to

the nature of the substance which produces the line 1474 K. Since it coincides

with a line in the spectrum of iron, it is by many considered due to that metal
but then we must suppose either that iron vapour is less dense than hydrogen gas,

or that it is subject to some peculiar solar repulsion which maintains it at its ele-

vation                            or other                                            hypotheses                                                                      may be  suggested for explaining the fact.  Since the
                               ;

line is one of the least conspicuous in the spectrum of iron and the shortest, and as

none of the others are found associated with it in the coronal spectrum, it seems

natural, as many have done, to^assume at once that it is due to some new kind of

matter. But the observations of AngstriJm, lioscoe, and Clifton, and recently those

of Schuster regarding the spectrum of nitrogen, render it probable that elementaiy

bodies have only one spectrum                                                                                                                                             and since in all experimental spectra we necessarily
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

operate only on a small thickness of a substance, we cannot say what new lines

may be given out in cases where there is an immense thickness of vapour

and hence we cannot conclude with certainty that because there is an unknown

line in the chromosphere or corona, it implies a new substance. Another problem,

the most perplexing of aD, is the reconciliation of the strangely discordant obser-

vations upon the polarization of the coronal light ; but I will at once proceed to

the points on which photography alone can give us decisive information.

The nature and conditions of the outer corona (the assemblage of dark rifts

and bright rays which overlies and surrounds the inner corona) was very incom-

pletely studied                                                                       and the question whether it is solar was not                                                            finally          settled in the

Aobserved just at the beginning and end of totality are really caused by it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          light

haze of meteoric dust between us and the moon might give results much resembling

those observed                                                                        but when we come to details this theory seems to be doubtful.
                                                                                   ;

Here photography steps in to pave the way out of the existing doubts. If the

rays and rifts were reaUy atmospheric, it would hardly be possible that they should

present the same appearance at different stations along the line of totality ; indeed

they would probably change their appearance every moment, even at the same

station. If they are cislunar, the same appearances could not be recorded at

distant stations. It is universally admitted that proof of the invariability of these

markings, and especially of their identity as seen at widely separated stations,

would amount to a demonstration of their extraterrestrial origin. Eve-sketches

cannot be depended on                                                                                                            the drawings made                                by                                                                             persons standing  side by side differ
                                                                                                                              ;

often to an extent that is most perplexing. Now photogi-aphs have, undoubtedly,

as yet failed to catch many of the faint markings and delicate details ; but their

testimony, as far as it goes, is unimpeachable. In 1870, Lord Lindsav at Santa

Maria, Professor Winlock at Jerez, Mr. Brothers at Syracuse, obtained pictures

some of which, on account partly of the unsatisfactory state of the weather, could

not compare with Mr. Brothers's picture obtained with an instrument of special

construction*; but all show one deep rift especially, which seemed to cut down

through both the outer and inner corona clear to the limb of the moon. Even

to the naked eye it was one of the most conspicuous features of the eclipse. Many

other points of detail also come out identical in the Spanish and Sicilian pictures
but whatever doubts may have still existed in regard to the inner corona were

finally dispelled by the pictm-es taken in India, in 1871, by Colonel Tenuant and

Lord Lindsay's photographic assistant, Mr. Davis.

None of the photographs of 1871 shows so great an extension of the corona as is

seen in Mr. Brothers's photograph, taken at Syracuse in 1870 ; but, on the other hand,

the coronal features are perfectly defined on the several pictures, and the number of

the photographs renders the value of the series singulariy great. The agreement

between the views, as well those taken at different times during totality'' as those

Wetaken at different stations, fully proves the solar theory of the inner corona. ""                                                                                                                                                                                                                  have

in all the views the same extensive corona, with persistent rifts similarly situated.

Moreover there is additional evidence indicated by the motion of the m'oon across

the solar atmospheric appendages, proving in a similar manner as in 1860, in re-

ference to the protuberances, the solar origin of that part of the corona.

It will be well here to mention a difficulty which occurs in recording the fainter

solar appendages, namely the encroachment of the prominences and" the corona
on the lunar disk when the plates have to be overexposed in order to bring out

the faint details of the corona. It is satisfactory to find that whenever a difficulty

arises it can he mastered by proper attention. ~ Lord Lindsay and Mr. Ranyard

have successfully devoted themselves to experiments on the subject. They tested
whether reflections from the back surface of the plate played any part in the

production of the fringes : for this purpose plates of ebonite and the so-called non-

actmic yellow        glass                                                            were prepared                                                                          and  it wa.s                                                                        immediately found      that     the  outer
                                                                                                                                                                    :

haze had completely disappeared in the photographs takein on ebonite, while on

the yellow glass plates it is much fainter than on ordinary white glass plates.
By placing" a piece of wetted black paper at the back of an unground plate, the
outer haze was greatly reduced; but by grinding both the back and the front sur-

faces of a yellow glass plate, and covering the back with a coating of black varnish,
it was rendered quite imperceptible, thus showing the greatest part of the so-called

pliotographic irradiation to be due to reflection from the second surface.

* Mr. Brothers had,, in 1870, the happy idea to employ a so-called rapid rectilinear
photographic lens, made by Dallmeyer, of 4 inches aperture and 30 inches focal length,
mounted
         equatorially, and                                                                                                       driven                                      by clockwork                                                                        and he  was  followed  in this  matter by

8 REPORT 1872.

In connexion with tlie solution of the most prominent questions connected with the

solar envelopes, it may not be without great interest to allude to another point con-

clusively decided during the last annular eclipse of the sun, observed by ^Ir. Pogson

on the 6th of June of this year, as described by him in a letter to Sir George B. Airy.

In 1870 Professor Young was the first to observe the reversal of the Fraiienhofer

lines in the stratum closest to the sun. Now, in 1871 doubts were thrown upou the

subject. It appears that the reversed lines seem to have been satisfactorily observed

by Captain Maclear at Bekul, Colonel Tennant at Dodabetta, and Captain Fyers at

Jaifna. The observations of Pringle at Eekul, Respighi at Paodoxottah, and Pogson

at Avenashi were doubtful ; while Mosely at Trincomalee saw nothing of this re-

versal, which is, according to all accounts, a most striking phenomenon, although of

very short duration. Mr. Locli^yer missed it by an accidental derangement of the

telescope. The reversal and the physical deductions from it are placed beyond

doubt by Mr. Pogson's observations of the annular eclipse on June 6th. At the

first internal contact, just after a peep in the finder had shown the moon's limb

lighted up by the corona, he saw all the dark lines reversed and bright, but for less

than two seconds. The sight of beauty above all was, however, the reversion of

--the lines at the breaking-up of the limb. The duration was astonishing five

to seven seconds ; and the fading-out was gradual, not momentary. This does
not accord with Captain Maclear's observations in 1870, who reports the disap-

pearance of the bright spectrum as " not instantly, but so rapidly that I could

not make out the order of their going." Professor Young again saj's that "they

flashed out like the stars from a rocket- head." But discrepancies in this minor

point may be accounted for by supposing ditlerences in quietude of that portion

of the sun's limb last covered by the moon.

The mention of the solar appendages recalls to mind another instance in which

photography has befriended the scientific investigator. I allude to the promising

attempt which has been made by Professor Young to photograph the protuberances

Aof the sun in ordinary daylight.                                         distinct reproduction of some of the double-

headed prominences on the sun's limb was obtained ; and although as a picture the

impression may be of little value, still thei-e is every reason to believe, now that

the possibility of the operation is known, that with better and more suitable appa-

ratus an exceedingly valuable and reliable record may be secured. Professor

Young employed for the purpose a spectroscope containing seven prisms, fitted to

a telescope of 6^-inch aperture, after the eyepiece of the same had been removed.

A camera, with the sensitive plate, was attached to the end of the spectroscope,

the eyepiece of which acted in the capacity of a photographic lens, and projected

the image on the collodion film. The exposure was necessarily a long one, amount-

ing to three minutes and a half The eyepiece of the spectroscope was unsuitable

for photographic purposes, and only in the centre yielded a true reproduction of

Athe lines free from any distortion.                                      larger telescope, with a suitable secondary

magnitiei', will be required in order to secure a more defined image.

I have hitherto spoken of the successful applications of photography to astro-

nomy                                       but  I must  point  out  also  some  cases  where  it  has  failed.  Nebula} and

comets have not yet been brotight within the grasp of this art, although, perhaps,

no branch of astronomy would gain more if we should hereafter succeed in extend-

ing to these bodies that mode of observing them. There is theoretically, and even

practically, no real limit to the sensitiveness of a plate. Similarly with reference

to planets great difficulties still exist, which must be overcome before their phases

and physical features can be recorded to some purpose by photography yet there
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

is great hope that the difficulties may be ultimately surmounted. The main ob-

stacle to success arises from atmospheric currents, which are continualh' altering

the position of the image on the sensitive plate; the structure of the sensitive film

Ais also an interfering cause for such small objects.                                         photograph taken at Cran-

ford of the occultation of Saturn by the moon some time ago exhibits the ring of

the planet in a manner which holds out some promise for the future.

The moon, on the other hand, has been for some time past very successfully

photogi-aphed ; but no use has hitherto been made of lunar photographs for the

pui-poses of measurement.

The photographs of the moon are fi-ee from distortion, and offer therefore

material of incalculable value as the basis of a selenographic map of absolute trust-

worthiuess, and also for the solution of the great problem of the moon's physical

libration. This question can be solved with certainty by a series of systematic

measurements of the distance of definite lunar points firom the limb. Mr. EUerj',

Director of the Observatory of Melbourne, has sent over an enlargement of a lunar

photograph taken with the Great jNIelbourne Telescope, in which the primary

image is 8^^ inches in diameter. Such lunar negatives would be admirably adapted
for working out the problem of the physical libration, and also for fuudamental
measm-ements for a selenographic map ; the more minute details, however, would

have to be supplied by eye-observations, as the best photograph fails to depict all

that the eye sees with the help of optical appliances. On the other hand, seleno-

graphic positions would be artbrded more free from error than those to be obtained

by direct micrometrical measurements.

' Although, as I have st<ated, I do not contemplate passing in review recent dis-

coveries in astronomy, I nmst not omit to call your attention to some few
subjects of engrossing interest. First, with reference to the more recent work of

Dr. Huggins. In his observations he foimd that the brightest line of the three

bright lines which constitute the spectrum of the gaseous nebulas was coincident

with the brightest of the lines of the spectrum of nitrogen ; but the aperture of his
telescope did not permit him to ascertain whether the line in the nebulas was

double, as is the ca,se with the line of nitrogen. With the large telescope placed

in his hands by the Royal Society, he has found that the line in the nebulas is not

double, and in the case'of the great nebula in Orion it coincides in position with

the less refi-angible of the two lines which make up the corresponding nitrogen-
line. He has not yet been able to find a condition of luminous nitrogen in which

the line of this gas is single and narrow and defined like the nebular line.

  He has extended the method of detecting a star's motion in the line of sight by

a change of refrangibility in the line of a terrestrial substance existing on the star
to about 30 stars besides Sirius. The comparisons have been made %\'ith lines of

hydrogen, magnesium, and sodium. In consequence of the extreme difficulty of the

investigation, the numerical velocities of the stars have been obtained by estima-

tion, and are to be regarded as provisional only. It will be observed that, speaking

generally, the stars which tlie spectroscope shows to be moving fi'om the earth, as

Sirius, Betelgeux, Rigel, Procyon, are situated in a part of the heavens opposite to

Hercules, towards which the sun is advancing while the stars in the neighbour-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

hood of this region, as Arcturus, Vega, and a Cygni, show a motion of approach.

There are, however, in the stars already observed, exceptions to this general state-

ment; and there are some other considerations, as the relative velocities of the

stars, which appear to show that the sun's motion in space is not the onh^ or even

in all cases the chief cause of the observed proper motions of the stars. In the ob-

served stellar motions we have to do probably with two other independent motions

namely, a movement common to certain groups of stars and also a motion peculiar

to each star. Thus the stars /3, y, S, e, ( of the Great Bear, which have similar
proper motions, have a common motion of recession ; while the star a of the same

constellation, which has a proper motion in the opposite direction, is sho-mi by the
spectroscope to be approaching the earth. From further researches in this direc-

tion, and from an investigation of the motions of stars in the line of sight in con-

junction with their proper motions at right angles to the visual direction obtained

by the ordinary methods, we may hope to gain some definite knowledge of the con-

stitution of the heavens.

This discovery supports, in a somewhat striking manner, the views which

Mr. Proctor has been urging respecting the distribution of the stars in space.

According to these views there exist within the sidereal system subordinate

systems of stars forming distinct aggregations, in which many orders of real mag-
nitude exist, while around them is relatively barren space. He had infen-ed the

existence of such systems from the results of processes of equal-surface charting

applied successively to stars of gradually diminishing orders of brightness. H-e

found the same regions of aggregation, whether the charts included stars to the

sixth order only or were extended, as in his chart of the northern heavens, to the

tenth and eleventh orders ; and these regions of aggregation are the very regions

where the elder Herschel found the faintest telescopic stars to congregate. Ap-
plying a new system of charting to show the proper motions of the stars, he
found fm'ther evidence in favour of these views. Ihe charts indicated the exis-
tence of conciuTent motions among the members of several groups or sets of
stars. Selecting one of the more striking instances as affording what appeared to
him a crucial test of the reality of this star-drift, Mr. Proctor announced his belief
that whenever the spectroscopic method of determining stellar motions of recess

or approach should be applied to the live stars /3, y, 8, e, and ( Ursse Majoris, these
orbs (which formed a drifting set in the chart of proper motions) would be found to
be drifting collectively either towards or from the earth : this has been confirmed.

   The time has now come for more closely investigating the various theories which

have been propounded by such profound thinkers as Tyndall, Tait, Reynolds, and
others, to account for the phenomena of Comets. I do not propose to enter into a
statement of these theories ; but I venture to call your attention to Zollner's views,

which have recently given rise to a great amount of controversy. In doing so, I am

solely influenced by a desire to give information on this subject, without implying

thereby that I give my adherence, or even preference, to his theory*.

   The vaporization of even solid bodies at low temperatures suggests-that a mass
of matter in space vnW ultimately surround itself with its own vapour, the tension
of which wiU depend upon the mass of the body (that is, upon its gravitative energy)
and the temperature. If the mass of the body is so small that its attractive force

is insufficient to give to the enveloping vapour its maximum tension for the exist-

ing temperature, the evolution of vapour wiU be continuous until the whole mass
is converted into it. It is proved by analysis that such a mass of gas or vapour in
empty and unlimited space is in a condition of unstable equilibrium, and must be-
come dissipated by continual expansion and consequent decrease of density. It
follows that celestial spaces, at least within the limits of the stellar imiverse, must
be filled with matter in the form of gas.

  A fluid mass existing in space at a distance from the sun or other body radiating

heat would, if its mass were not too great, be converted entirely into vapour after
the lapse of sufficient time. But if the fluid mass approach the sun, solar heat
would occasion a more rapid development of vapour on the sunward side ; and
the total vaporization would require an incomparably short time with reference to
the interval necessary in the former case ; this time would be shorter the smaller
the mass of the body. Professor Zolhier points to the smaller comets, which often
appear as spherical masses of vapour, as examples of such bodies, while the
spectra of some of the nebulfe and smaller comets render the existence of fluid
masses giving out vapour highly probable.

   The self-luminosity and train of comets he refers to other causes. Two causes
only are known through the operation of which gases become self-luminous

elevation of temperature (as by combustion), or electrical excitement. Setting
aside the first as involving theoretical difficulties, the second cause is demonstrated
by him to be sufficient to account for the self-luminosity and the formation of the

train, provided it be granted that electricity may be developed by the action of

solar heat, if not in the process of evaporation, at least in the mechanical aud
molecular disturbances resulting from it. The production of electricity by such
processes within the limits of our experience must be admitted as a well-kno'^Ti
fact. The spectrum of the vaporous envelope of a comet, illuminated in this
manner, must necessarily be that produced by the passage of an electrical discharge
through vapour identical in substance with a portion of the comet's nucleus, from
which the envelope is derived. As, according to this supposition, water and
liquid hj'drocarbons are important constituents of these bodies, the spectra of the
comets should be such as belong to the vapours of these substances ; and in this
manner the resemblance and partial coincidence of the observed cometic spectra
with those of gaseous hydrocarbons is explained.

   The form and direction of the train indicate imdoubtedly the action of a repul-

sive force : and Professor Zcillner asserts that the assimiption of an electrical action
of the sun upon bodies of the solar system is necessary and sufficient to account
for all the essential and characteristic phenomena of the vaporous envelope and

                                                     * See Appendix, p. 12.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  11

    the train. The direction of the train, towards or from the sun, is, according to this

    theory, to be easily explained by the supposition of a variability in the mutual elec-
    trical conditions. This accords perfectly with the phenomena observed in the

    development of electricity by vapour-streams in the hydroelectric machine, where

    the sign of the electricity depends upon the presence or absence of various sub-

     stances in the boiler or the tubes.

       The theory acquires an additional interest fi'om Schiaparelli's remarkable dis-

    covery of the identity of the paths of certain comets witli great meteor-streams,
    since the meteoric masses must inevitably be converted into vapour on approaching

    the sun, with exhibition of the characteristic appearances of the comets.
       The intimate connexion of planetary configuration and solar spots, of the latter and

    teiTestrial magnetism and auroral phenomena, must tend to establish also a connexion
    between solar spots and solar radiation. It is demonstrated, by the researches of

    Piazzi Smyth, Stone, and Cleveland Abbe, that there is a connexion between the

  --amoimt of heat received from the sun and the prevalence of spots a result clearly

    in harmony -Rath those derived from recent investigations into the nature of the solar

    atmosphere. Further, in a paper by Mr. Meldrum, of Mauritius, which will be read
    before you during this session, most remarkable evidence is given on the close con-

    nexion of these phenomena. It appears that the cyclones of the Indian Ocean have

    a periodicity corresponding with the sun-spot periodicity so that if an observer in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

    another planet could see and measure the sun-spots and cyclones (earth-spots), he
    would find a close harmony between them. Such a connexion will probably be
    found to exist over the globe generally ; but with reference to the Indian Ocean it

   may be stated as a matter of fact, from Mr. Meldrum 's discussion of twenty-five

    years' observations, that in the area lying between the equator and 25° south lati-
    tude, and between 40° and 110° east longitude, the frequency of cyclones has varied

   during that period directly as the amount of sun-spots. I am glad to be able to

    announce that Mr. Meldrum, in order to place the deductions on a still broader foun-
    dation, proposes to investigate these laws on a plan perfectly in agreement with our
    method of determining the areas of solar disturbances, the results of which have been
    published from time to time during the last ten years. Moreover the observations

    on the periodic changes of Jupiter's appearance, and the observations of Mr. Bax-

  --endell that the convection-currents of our earth vary according to the sun-spot period
        all these results, seemingly solitary, but truly in mysterious harmony, point to

    the absolute necessity for establishing constant photographic records of solar and

   terrestrial phenomena all over the world. No astronomer or physicist should lose

    any opportunity of assisting in this great aim, by which alone unbiased truthful

   records of phenomena can be preserved. What is more, no system of observations

    can be carried on at a less expense.

      _We have hopes of seeing the photographic method as applied to sun-observations
   joined to the work of the Greenwich Observatory ; but what is further wanted is the
   erection of instruments for photogi-aphic records and of spectroscopes in a number
^^ of obsei-vatories throughout the world, so as to obtain daily records of the sun and
   to observe magnetical and meteorological phenomena continuously in connexion
    with solar activity. Meteorological observation is storing up iiseful facts ; but

    they can only be dealt with effectually if investigated in close parallelism with

   other cusmical phenomena. Only when this is done may we hope to penetrate

   the maze of local meteorological phenomena and elevate meteorology to the rank
    of a science. The time has really come not only for relieving private observers
    from the systematic observation of solar phenomena, but for drawing close ties
    between all scattered scientific observations, so as to let one grand scheme embrace
   the whole ; and no method seems to be so well adapted to bring about this great
    achievement than the method of photographing the phenomena of nature, which
    in its very principle carries with it all extinction of individual bias.

      In conclusion I cannot refrain from making a passing allusion to a Royal Com-
    mission, presided over by the Duke of Devonshire, which has been sitting for some

    time past ; for I believe that its labours will have an important bearing on all that
    relates to scientific education and the promotion of science in this countiy. The

   time has come when the cultivation of science must be protected and fostered by
    the state ; it can no longer be safely left to individual efforts. If England is to

   Certain conclusions at which Professor ZciUner arrives in the investigation of
several points bearing on the theory which he defends are, quite independent of
the latter, of high scientific value.

   First, with reference to the density of atmospheric air, which (in accordance
with the considerations mentioned in stating his views) he supposes to fill the
interstellar space everywhere, he assumes for the purposes of calculation that the
temperature of space is that of melting ice, and finds that the lower limit of

density for a portion of gas in space is -ttwjj- of that of the air at the earth's surface,

a value so small that if a mass of air which, at its ordinary density upon the
earth's surface, occupies a volume of one cubic decimetre (a litre) were reduced
to the density expressed by this fraction, it would fill a sphere whose radius would
not be traversed by a ray of light in less than 10"'* years. These values indicate a
density which would have no appreciable effect whatever upon rays of light or
upon the motion of bodies in space, and which would become still less if the tem-

--perature of space be taken, with Fourier, at -- 60° C, or with Pouillet, at 1.32° C.

But as every solid body must, by virtue of its gravitative energy, condense the gas
into an atmospheric envelope round itself, the density of the latter will solely
depend on the size and mass of the body. Professor Zollner finds by calculation
that, for instance, the density of air thus forming an atmosphere round the moon

must be frisai of that of the air of the earth's surface. This is in accord with the

fact that no trace of a lunar atmosphere has as yet been detected. But the
values become very great for the larger planets, quite great enough to manifest
absorptive effects upon the light reflected from them. Considering that there are
peculiarities in the spectra of Uranus, Neptune, and also of Jupiter, which appear
to indicate atmospheric influences. Professor Ziillner's results are not without
deep interest, and certainly suggestive of further inquiry.

   Secondly, with reference to the supposition that a body may be at the same

time under the influence of gravitative and electrical agencies, it was necessary for
the author of this theory to discuss the quantitative ditt'erence in their effect upon
ponderable masses at a distance. The discussion shows that, if the mass increases,
gravitation preponderates over electricity ; if the mass decreases sufliciently, the
contrary takes place. It follows that the cometary nuclei, as masses, are subject
to gravitation, while the attenuated vapours developed from them yield to the
action of free electricity of the sun. Professor Zollner has based upon Hankel's
numerous and careful researches on the determination of atmospheric electricity,
in absolute measure, an analytical inquiry into the motion of a small sphere under
the action of gravity and atmospheric electricity, which leads to some remarkable
results. Supposing the free electricity of the sun to be not greater than that
repeatedly observed on the earth's surface, and to be uniformly distributed, it
would communicate to a sphere having a diameter of 11 millimetres and a weight
of yi^ of a milligramme, and starting from the sun, by the time it had moved as far
away as the mean distance of Mercury, a velocity per second of 3,027,000 metres,
or 408'4 German geographical miles *. This velocity is such that in two days it
would pass over a space of 70,.540,000 German geographical miles, a magnitude
quite of the same order as those recorded by cometary astronomy. The discussion
was undertaken to prove that there is no need for assuming the existence of anj'
unknown repulsive agency, but that electrical energy not greater than that observed
on the earth's surface is amply sufficient to account satisfactorily for the pheno-
mena presented by cometic trains.

expanded by the binomial theorem, has always the form AN^-f BN* + C, since

this integral, viz. by expanding the factor e ''' and integrating term by term, or by
multiplying by e^" and transforming the new integral, &c., both fail through the
occurrence of infinite values for the terms after a certain point, the reason for which
will appear further on. It might perhaps be thought that when n was arbitrary
the formula (1), the factorial being replaced by the Gamma-function, would still
be true by the principle of the permanence of equivalent forms, the series then
extending to intiuity ; but such is not the case. The value of the integral in the

0)1 the Function that stands in the same Relation to Bernoulli's Numbers that

   the Gamma-function does to Factorials. By J. W. L. Glaisher, B.A.,

   F.R.A.S.

It is always a matter of some interest to regard a series of const.ants as particular

values of a continuous function, which function can usually be exhibited as a de-

finite integral. The problem is of course indeterminate, as through a series of

Soints at finite intervals from one another an infinite number of curves can be

rawn ; but, as in the case of the Gamma-function in its connexion with the factorial

1 . 2. .. .r, there is usually but one curve, which, in an analytical point of view,

stands in this relation. It seems, therefore, worth while to investigate the function

connecting Bernoulli's numbers                                                                                                                                                   and this is readily effected as follows.
                                                                                                                                                                              ;

         On the Laiu of Distrihution of Prime Numbers.

             By J. W. L. Glaisher, 'B.A., F.RA.S.

   In the 'Philosophical Magazine ' for July 1849 the late Mr. Hargreave proved two

results of great interest in the theory of minibers, viz. that the average distance

between two primes about the point x of the ordinal series was log^ x, and that the

--number of primes between x' and x was very nearly lia;' lij?, li.r being the
---- Alogarithm-integi'al of x, ^iz. li x=z C . result practically the same was

also arrived at by Tchebycheif, Petersburgh Transactions, 1848 (see ' Philosophical

Magazine,' August 1854).

The general truth of these results was verified by IlargTeave for a number of

ranges among numbers  less than a million                                                                        but iu only one case did he compare the
                                                                                                              ;

numbers given by the formulae with the numbers counted above this limit. The

means for making this comparison are afforded bj' Burckhardt's Tables, which give

the least divisor of every uiunber not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 from unity to three
millions, and Dase's Tables, which do the same for numbers between six millions
and nine millions. The intermediate three millions, although existing in manu-
script in the libraiy of the Berlin Academy, have not been published. Burckhardt's

Tables were published in 1814-17, and were therefore accessible to Hargreave ; but

Dase's have only been published since 1862. By means of these Tables, of course

all the primes included within their limits can be found, as their "least factors" being

themselves, they are denoted in the Tables by a bar. I have therefore had all the

primes in every hundred of the six millions over which the Tables extend counted,

and have also calculated the numbers given by the formidfe ; and the results,
arranged in groups of 50,000 for two millions (viz. the second and the ninth),
are given in the two Tables below. The second million was chosen iu preference

to the first for insertion in this abstract, partly because results derived from the

counting of primes in the latter have been exhibited by Legendre, Hargreave, and

others, and partly because the distribution is very anomalous near the commence-

ment of the series of numerals.

   The numbers in the millions were divided iato groups of 50,000, and x' is written
for brevity for x-{- 50,000. In the first Table the numbers iu the " Primes counted "

column are the numbers of primes between x and x' ; thus there are 3635 primes

between 1,000,000 and 1,050,000, &c. In the second Table the logarithm of the
middle number of the group of the 50,000 was taken as the logarithm for the
group, and the " Average interval between the primes " was found by dividing
50,000 by the corresponding number in the " Primes counted " column of the fii-st
Table, the average intervals between two primes in the group from 1,000,000 to

1,050,000 being 1376, &c.

  The logarithm-integral is only a transformation of the exponential integral, the

relation between the two being li e''=:Ei .r ; and by the use of Toylor's theorem we

find

insensible, while for j/ =8,000,000 the second term was only O-C ; so that the first

two terms were practically sufficient for the second million, with the interval of

50,000, and the first alone for the ninth million. It is impossible, in a brief abstract

like the p^resent, to notice the a°OTeement with Lee:^endi'e's formula log a^-1 -08.360

The results given in the two Tables above were calculated or counted in duplicate

wrong by so much as a unit, though an error of this amount is just possible. In

Hargreave has given a formula which is no doubt a particular case of that in this
Eaper (though I have not yet compared them) ; but either some of his constants must

  ave been erroneous, or he must have made errors]of calculation, as all the numbers
given in the Table on page 48 of the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for July 1849, which
was calculated by means of it, seem to be more or less inaccurate (see ' Philoso-

phical Transactions,' 1870, p. 386 ; the arguments are identical, as, in fact, HargTeave
has taken integer arguments of the exponential integral, viz. Ei 1, Ei2, &c.).

   It maybe added that the number of primes between 1 ,000,000 and 2,000,000

was computed by Hargreave and found to be 70,430, which differs by only a imit
from the value in this paper (which value, as before remarked, could very well
have been inaccurate by even more than this amount) ; and this completely verifies
the accuracy of the numbers in the li x'--\\ x column of the first Table between
two and three millions. Hargreave (Philosophical Magazine, August 1854) found
the number of " Primes counted" up to one million and between two and three
millions to be 78,403 and 67,751 respectively ; while the formula gave 78,626 and
67,916, the discrepancies being much greater than that which is here foimd for the
second million, where the ditterence was only 9. The numbers I have found for
the " Primes counted " differ from Hargreave's ; but as they have as yet been
counted but once, no great reliance can be placed on them. The formula values I

have not yet calculated.

  Problem. To find the conditions that a Quartan may have 3 Diameters.
  That it may have one, the equation must admit the form

where X,, means a function of x of the nth degree.

  PLet = a;- +y^j then we may write

This form will not be changed if we change the origin to any point in the axis

of y ; hence, if there be a second diameter, we may may suppose it to pass through

= =the origin, which we treat as a Pole, making a; rcosi^, y r sin i|/-.

which by the routine of trigonometry is expressible as

          1

   This is the equation of every Quartan which has so much as one diameter.

  =In order that the line expressed by x/' y may be a new diameter, it is necessary and it
=suffices that the same equation should result by substituting \|/- y+(B, and\jr=y--eo,

where y is a definite constant, r, a the variables of the equation. Put yj/ = y+to ; then

+in order that may give the same result, the terms concerned must vanish in the

coefficients of r*, r'^. r'^, r separatelJ^ It must be observed that the assumption

=y or y=180° is useless; and y = 90° leads us to two rectangular diameters, not

to three. Hence we must avoid to suppose sin y=0 or sin2y=0.

Now  w=0(1) nr sin y . sin <b=0, .·.
     m = m=Q(2)

     (3) in the coefficient of r^, we need at once

     -- =(B |^)8in y sin cl>=0 ; \l sin 3y . sin So 0.

B=0It is useless to suppose ^=0,     ; for this, joined with m=Q, w=0, reduces the

equation to the Doubly Diametral. Hence our only useful results are

     sin3y=0, B=f/; which leave B and/ finite.

(4) (A Jc) sin 2y . sin 2ii=0,k sin 4y sin 4ci)=0.

  We cannot make sin 4y=0, since we already require =sin3y 0.           Hence nothing

remains but k=0, A=0.

   Thus the original equation is reduced to

                 ar''+(Ba:+C)r==fBar'+p;                                Qi)

and from sin3y=0we get i)6'o new diameters, defined by y=60° and y = 180°.

Thus the problem is solved.

  Originally, the assumption «=0 would have left our monodiametral curve still

Aa Quartan. But after supposing = and /i-=0, we cannot make a also = without

reducing the equation to a Tertian. In fact it is easy to show that the conditions

here investigated yield the known Tertian Tnjiiyawhen-we add the assumption a = 0.

at most only one positive value to y^ ; ory^=yj2+Y^, giving in some cases two

also Y-= is/X^. If Xj degenerate, Y^=; V^i is a Quartic Parabola. Y'^= ^X., is
a Doiihhj Diametral Quartan, which is hero assumed to be known ; Y^= v^X., is
the primary Quartotertian (9th Class of Quartans) ; Y-= \/Xj is the primary Quarto-

hyperbolic of the 17th class. Thus the 9th class becomes auxiliary to the 10th,
13th, and IGth ; and the 17th is auxiliary to all which follow it. The 1st class
(Quartic Parabola) is auxiliary to the 11th and 14th.

   It is believed that in the 8th class alone there are in strictness as many as 260
species. This makes it impossible to undertake to draw them all, which multiply
more and more in the higher classes, as the number of constants increase. Never-
theless many diagrams are laid before the Association, nearly exhausting the forms
of the earlier classes. The Semicubical and the Quartotertian are notable as pecu-
liarly novel and most remote from the Doubly Diametral.

   Many of the forms might be conjectured beforehand from the Doubly Diametral

by merely introducing inequality, as in place of two equal, two unequal ovals.
Nevertheless there is much that could never be so conjectured, just as in the Doubly
Diametral we could not conjecture the forms of the inferior classes from knowing

the superior forms.

cune wliicli belongs to temperatiu-es below tliat of the triple point T *. Tbis sup-

posed extension of the steam-vrith-water curve into temperatures below that of the

triple point, where freezing would certainly set in if any ice were present, is to be

conceived of as a curve corresponding to states of equilibrium between tlie steam

and water. It is well known that water can, in various circumstances, be reduced

in temperature below its freezing-point without its freezing ; and this the author

attributes to a difficulty of making a beginning of change of state f. It is also
known that the presence of a gaseous atmosphere, of common air with aqueous

vapour in contact with water, does not uecessarily introduce any condition which

will give liberty to the water-substance to make a beginning of change of state

into ice, either from the liquid or the gaseous part, or from both at their face of

contact. Thus there can scarcely be a doubt but that the steam-with-water curve,

L T, has a practically attainable extension past T ; and valid reasoning, the author

thinks, may certainly be founded on the supposition of this cui've as one of equili-

brium between steam and water,

Bextracted, and then the counterpoise must just balance th^ weight of the piston.
ALet weights A, be laid on the piston, which will give exactly the pressiire p,

to the fluid enclosed in the cavity of the cylinder ; and let this enclosed fluid be

supposed to bo water-substance taken at first in the state of steam with water, as

Wshown in the figure, where S is steam and is water.

Let the entire cylinder and its contents be maintained at the temperature t^ (a

temperature below that of the triple point) by immersion in a bath at that tempe-

rature, ^], as shown in the figure.

  Now apply an infinitely small extra weight on the piston, so that the internal

+pressure                            S, where S is infinitely small.
         becomes                                                      This causes the steam to go
                                ;^i

perfectly gently down to water.

Now insert a particle of ice. Brisk action or agitation instantly sets in.

Thus:--

   (1) The water with ice cannot repose without both coming to the temperature

+which, for the pressure ^^i S, or we may here as well say for the pressure ^jj,

belongs to water with ice ; that is to say, in reference to fig. 1 a, the water with

Uice cannot repose without both coming to the temperature of the point on the

water-with-ice line in that figure.

(2) The water at this raised temperature, or at any of the intermediate tempe-

ratures between this and the temperatm-e i, of the sm-rounding bath, is in a state

tending to ebullition into steam, a state in which boiling will ensue if a beginning

be made at all, or if due facility to begin be afforded in any way.

   (3) Conduction of heat, or conduction with convection, is briskly going on, con-
veying heat out to the bath, since the temperature inside is at some parts warmer

than the bath, and is nowhere cooler.

Now, either ebullition ensues, or it does not.

First. Suppose it not to take place :

Parts of the water are warmed by the freezing-process. They briskly transmit

heat out to the bath, the freezing goes briskly on, and the same process of trans-

mission of heat from a higher to a lower temperature goes briskly forward. This

continues till all the enclosed fluid has become ice.

  Now it is obvious that if there is a brisk action, with rapid conduction of heat,

when steam, or water-substance partly steam and partly water, is allowed to pass

+into the state of ice while the pressui'e is^s^ S and the surrounding temperature is

<j, there could be no return or reversal to the old condition of steam, or of steam

with water, caused or allowed by merely an infinitely small abatement of pressure
from /^i-f-S to p^. To cause the ice to evaporate, or to get it to remain in equili-

brium with steam, which we know experimentally it can do at a low enough pres-

sure, a finite (not infinitely small) abatement of pressure is necessary.

Thus has been proved what was wanted, provided we be right in supposing

ebullition not to talie place.

But now :

--Second. Suppose ebullition to ensue on the introduction of the ice a com-

plicated interaction of water, steam, and ice, involving brisk agitation, must

set in. At any face of contact of water and ice, the temperature must be that

Uof the point in fig. 1 « ; at any face of contact of steam and ice the tempe-

Wrature must become that which "belongs to the pressiu'e pj^ on the steam-with-ice
line, and which is shown at the point  in fig. 1 a on the supposition of the

curves crossing as represented in that figure ; and at any face of contact of steam

Wwith water the temperature must be that of the point C. As yet we need not

assume that we know whether the point for pressure p^ on the steam-with-ice

line is at a higher temperature than that of C, as is represented in fig. 1 a, or at

a lower temperature than that of C, as it would be if the curves crossed as in fig.
1 b ; but clearly we know that the temperature of LT is higher than that of C,

which is the same as that of the bath ; and we can also see that any steam in con-

tact with water and sm-rounded with the bath at temperature <j while the pressure

is Pj^ will be ready to condense to water, or will actually so condense if the pres-
sure be increased by the infinitely small augmentation 8, just as did the steam

originally supposed to occupy part of the cavity. Thus we must have an action

going briskly on, involving rapid conduction of heat, an action involving the
                                                                                  --

continual courersion of -water-svibstance from tlie fluid state (gaseous or liquid) to

ice, aud wbicb goes on till no steam remains to condense to water at a face of con-

tact with water, and till no water remains to be frozen at a face of contact with

ice. As this process goes on with briskness or agitation, involving rapid conduc-

tion of heat, we can see that, as in the previously supposed case, the process is
in'eversible by an infinitely small abatement of pressure and we can see that to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

get steam to remain in repose in contact with ice at the temperature t^ of the sur-

rounding bath, we must have the pressure abated by a finite amount, so as to be

decidedly less than the pressure p^ belonging to steam with water at the fixed
temperatm'e of the bath : that is to say, for a temperature below the triple

^ioint the pressure of steam with ice is less than the pressure of steam with water.

   Hence, referring to fig. 1 a, we see that in the steam-with-ice curve the point

U, having the same temperature t^ as the point C of the steam-with-water curve
BDhas, must, while situated in the isothermal line
                                                    passing through C, be away

from C at the side where the pressure is less than at C ; or it must lie between
Y Aand the coordinate axis
                            produced past A.

This may be regarded as very nearly establishing that the curves cross one

Upanother, as drawn in fig. 1 a. It shows that they do not, as in fig. 1 6.       to

the present stage, however, the reasoning does not excUide the suppositions :

1st, that the curves might meet tangentially in the triple point T, and pass on

without crossing ; 2nd, that they might cross in the triple point, meeting each

other there tangentially j 3rd, that the steam-with-ice line might absolutely stop

short in the triple point.

The first and second of these I'emaining suppositions, depending, as they do, on

supposed tangential meeting instead of meeting or crossing angularly, the author

thinks very unlikely. One reason is that the condensed water-substance in contact

·with the steam makes a perfectly sudden change in its character in changing from

water to ice or from ice to water ; and he therefore thinks that in the curve which

represents steam with water above the triple point, and steam with ice below it,

we should expect to find a sudden change of direction at the point where this great

physical change suddenly takes place.

Another reason against the first of these suppositions wdU be given in what

follows almost immediately, bj- a proof that after meeting in the triple point in rising

from lower temperatures, they cannot go on further without crossing. The third

supposition, namely, that the steam-with-ice line might stop short in the triple

point, the author thinks A'ery imlikely to be the truth ; but he is not aware of any
experimental proof to oSqv against it.

Now, that the cur\ es, after meeting in the triple point in rising from lower tem-

peratures, cannot go on further without crossing, will be proved if it be shown that

on the supposition of tlie steam-with-ice curve not stopping short on rising to the

triple point, it must, on passing that point, have its course on the side of the

Y Asteam-with-water curve remote fi'om the coordinate axis       ; or, in other words,

if it be shown that, for any temperature t-, above the triple point, the pressm-e of

steam ^^-ith water is less than the pressure of steam with ice.

This can easily be done by a demonstration quite like the one already given for

a temperature below that of the triple point ; and a brief sketch of it will here

suffice.

Let us imagine that we have a cavity of variable dimensions, such as a cylinder

with a piston which can be loaded so as to apply any desired pressure to fluid sub-

stance enclosed within. Let this vessel contain steam with ice at a temperature

<2, which is above tliat of the triple point; and let the cylinder be immersed in a

bath maintained constantly at the temperature t^. Let the pressure of the steam

with ice for this temperature be called/).,-

  Now increase the pressure by an infinitely small amount S, making it /Jo+S.

"While this is kept applied to the steam, the steam is by it kept going down to the

state of ice ; and thus we can conceive of the whole or any desired part being con-

verted quite gentlj' to ice*. Next, while maintaining the pressure /^ ox p.^-\-h in

    * The fact that the ice being rigid would oppose a mechanical obstruction to the com-

 he steam, if any remains, or in the water next to be introduced, introduce a par-

ticle of water. Instantly the ice begins to melt, and falls in temperature, at the

place of contact with water, to the temperature of water with ice for the applied

Vpressui'e ^j^ or p.^-{.8 ; that is, to the point in the figure. But the surrounding bath

13 warmer than this, and so a decided difference of temperature is maintained,
involving a rapid conduction of heat from the warmer bath to the colder melting

ice and the cold water in contiguity to that ice. There can be no repose till all
the water-substance originally enclosed as steam with ice has become water ; be-

cause, while the steam can pass gently to ice under the pressure p^, on the sup-

position that some particle of ice is kept present, and will be forced down by the

infinitely small excess of pressure S, the ice must briskly rush to the state of water.

But we know we can have steam present in repose with water at the maintained
temperature t.^ if we make the pressure small enough. An infinitely small abate-
ment of pressure will not counteract or reverse the change which has been briskly
taking place ; and so the pressure must be made decidedly lower than either ^j^+S

or p., to allow of the water resting in equilibrium in contact with steam at the

temperatm'e t.^.

   That is to say, referring to fig. la, on any isothermal line, such as FG, the

point II, where it is cut by the steam-with-water line, must be nearer to the axis

AX than is the point G, where it is cut by the steam-with-ice line.

   This, then, closes the course of reasoning entered on hitherto in these pages, and
establishes (the author thinks with very little if any room left for doubt) that the two

curves do not cross as in fig. 1 b ; and that in meeting at the triple point, they do
not meet and pass tangentially without crossing, but that they must cross as in

The conclusion here arrived at the author thinks may admit of e.xpenmental

verification ; and he thinks it opens a desirable field for further and more perfect

experimental researches than have hitherto been made on the coexisting pressures

and temperatures of steam and other gaseous substances, each in contact with its

own substance, either in the liquid or in the solid state, at temperatures ranging

above and below the triple point for each substance. Without its being necessary

to make experiments on substances in the conditions represented by the dotted ex-

tensions of the curves past the triple point, he thinks that very accurate experi-

ments might show, for steam, an obtuse re-entrant angle or corner at T, in the line

L T N, which appears not to be one cm've, but two distinct curves meeting in T,

and crossing each other at that point.

   Through an examination which the author has made of the experimentally

Xderived curve given by Regnault * for what is shown as L T here in fig. 1 a, he

finds that the curve seems to show a slightly perceptible feature of the kind here

--anticipated a slight re-entrant angle, or at least a slightly flattened place, or

place of diminished curvature at the triple point ; but this feature does not appear

sufficiently marked to admit of its being relied upon as a decisive experimental

confirmation of the theoretical view here submitted.

The author also submitted to the Meeting the following additional considera-

tions on the subject.

It can easily be shown that the j^erpefual motion would be theoretically attainable

unless (1) the pressure of steam with ice for a temperature (!,, which is below the
triple point, were less than the pressure of steam with water for the same tempe-

rature t^ ; and also (2) unless the pressure of steam with water for a temperature
t.^, taken above the triple point, were less than the pressure of steam with ice for

the same temperature t^.

To prove the first of these, we have to observe that at t^, which is below the

triple point, in pressing steam down into water, we give mechanical work to the

substance (call this (t). Then when we insert ice, there is a finite difference of

temperatures, with conduction of heat out to the bath ; now by making this heat

pass, not by conduction, but through a thermodynamic engine (an air-engine for

instance), we can obtain work, which let us call h. During this freezing, too, we

get back from the water-substance a little work, owing to the expansion of the

water in freezing under the presure p^ (call this c). Next allow the volume to

increase wliile an'auging that the ice shall be evaporating into steam under the

temperatiire of the bath t^ ; we obtain mechanical work, which call d.

  Now if, in this expanding process of ice to steam, the pressure were as great as

Pi, which was the pressure dm-ing the compressing to water, we would get back on
the whole from the piston all the work we gave to it ; that is, the two portions
c and d of work got back would together be as much as we gave, namely a ; and we
woiild have made a clear gain of the work b obtained from the thermodynamic

engine.

 A --like proof could be given in respect to the second case that in which the

temperature is above the triple point.

  A slight extension of this reasoning will prove that the curves, in crossing at the

triple point, cannot cross tangentially.

   This can be seen obviously from the consideration that the work obtainable by
the thermodynamic engine is proportional to the difference of the temperatures
between which the heat is transmitted ; and that the difference between the work

given to the piston of the cavity in compressing steam to water, and that obtained

back again during the evaporation of the ice to steam, and then pressing the steam

when the evaporation is complete a little down till it attains again its origina.

pressure and volume, -^ivill be proportional, veiy approximately, to the difierence of

the pressures existing during the compression of steam to water, and the expansion

of ice to steam, which latter pressure let us now callp/. Also let us call the tem-

peratm-e of the triple point <,,.

   Thus it is obvious that we must have, as long as we keep very near the triple

point,  p^-p^cct^-t^.

                                                                                                                                                                      _

And this shows that the crossing of tlie curves must be angular, not tangential.

The author farther suggested that the reasoning here adduced may be followed

up by a quantitative calculation founded on experimental data, most if not all of

which are already available, by which calculation the difference of the pressures of

steam with water and steam with ice for any given temperature very near the

triple point may be foimd with a very close approximation to the truth,

   The very gi-eat inconvenience attendant upon the use of the ordinary position-
circle of a micrometer divided on a metallic limb, and the necessity of having small
lamps hung on to the micrometer for producing that very useful character of
illumination of the wires known as the " dark field," has induced the author to
introduce some modifications in this (to the observer at least) very important
part of an equatorial instrument.

   These modifications have already been applied with success, and for the first

time (as far as the author is aware) to a 7-inch refracting telescope now in course of

erection at the Observatorj^ of the Royal Artillery Institute, "NVoolwicli ; and the
author has (in consequence of this success) been ordered to adapt them to the

Great Equatorials now in course of construction for the Royal Observatory, Edin-

burgh, and the Obsei-vatory of the Lord Lindsay, Aberdeen*.
   The rack-and-pinion tube carrying the eyepiece or micrometer revolves freely

in the casting which forms the lower end of the telescope-tube, and carries a brass
plate (all cast in one piece), on which is cemented a flat ring of plate glass, muffed
on back and in front varnished with an opaque varnish. Through this varnish the
divisions are cut, so that on being illuminated from behind the divisions appear
bright upon a black ground. The vernier is similarly treated, and the whole of
this circle, being covered with a cap, -with a glazed window only sufficiently large
to expose the vernier and about lo° of the circle, is protected from possible injury

angular position. When the desired position is approximated and the trigger

relieved, the pin drops into the nearest hole,- and the endless screw is then used

for final setting.

   The diagram explains the various matters of illumination.
   From a lamp hanging upon the end of the declination axis is sent a beam of
slightly divergent light through this axis, which is hollow ; this slightly divergent
beam is utilized for six different purposes, three portions of it being reflected out
in different directions to illuminate portions of the declination circle, of which one
is for a long reader for setting from eye end, and the other two for micrometer

microscopes subdividing the 10' division of circle into single 1" arc.

   None of these are shown in diagram ; but the other three purposes for which the

light is utilized, viz. for position-circle, bright field illumination, and dark field

illumination of micrometer, are shown.

   The position-circle illumination is very simple (see fig. 1) ; a single reflector R,
attached to the inside of the tube, directs a constant beam of light on the back of the

glass circle at P.

   The bright field illumination is effected by a very small central reflector R',
which sends the light directly into the field of the micrometer.

   This method is, the author believes, now generally considered to give the best
results, and has, as far as he is aware, but one disadvantage, viz. that the arm

which supports the small mirror produces a little diffraction, and consequently

deterioration of definition.

This objection is in some measure reduced by making the arm and mirror

removable at pleasure by pulHng or releasing a string, so that while actually

observing, it can be removed and replaced instantaneously.

In devising the dark field illumination, the author started on the hypothesis that

there were two essential points to keep in view, viz. that the lines should be illumi-

nated on both sides (not one), and that the angle at which the light should be

thrown upon the wires should be very great, so that the blackness of the field as

seen through the eyepiece should not be injured.

   The best results were obtained ,by placing four prisms of total reflection roimd

the field of the micrometer, just behind the wires, and of such an angle that the

Wlight thrown upon them shoidd be reflected upon the wires at an angle such as
is shown in diagram fig. 2, where  is the position of wires in focus of objective.

In order that this scheme of illumination should be carried out etiectually

from the light of a single lamp hanging on the declination axis, it is necessary that

a certain annular portion of the micrometer which embraces these prisms should

be constantly illuminated from this lamp ; and this is eft'ected in the following way :
a portion of the slightly divergent beam of light, shown in fig. 2, proceediug from

the lamp on the declination axis is passed through a very low-power convex
lens, I, which renders the beam slightly convergent.

   This is not necessary, but a mere matter of convenience, as it reduces the neces-

sary size of the reflector and lens afterwards required. The light is now taken up

by a reflector, E, within the tube, and directed towards the eye end at such an angle

ithat it crosses the axis of the telescope just at the inner end of the eyepiece-tube.'=,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

hence it is passed through a piece of glass of a peculiar shape, P P, which is called,

for want of a better name, an annular prism lens. This piece of glass has a hole

cut in it large enough to admit the whole pencil of light from the object-glass.
   The use of this fiunular prism lens is twofold :

   1st. It has to alter the direction of the beam of light, before diagonally thrown

Racross the tube X, to that parallel to the axis of the telescope aud
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

    2nd. It is necessary that it should have a slightly converging efiect to reduce

the size of the illuminated circle it produces.

   This arrangement so far performs perfectly in all but one particular. It

throws a strong beam of light constantly upon the four prisms, p, p, and illu-
minates the lines well ; but although no direct light can enter into the field from

the mirror placed so far out of the cone of rays from the objective, still the light
thrown against the side of the eyepiece-tube is sufficient to completely destroy

the efiect of this illumination. The difficulty, however, has been completely
removed in this way.

   It should first be mentioned that the eyepiece or niicrometer-tube is made double,
an outer parallel tube and an inner taper one ; and it is between these two tliat

it is required that the light should be brought to the four prisms or micro-
meters, any light shining into the inner tube doing mischief by injuring the black-

ness of the field.

   On the lens used to give a slight convergence to the light is placed a circu-

lar opaque disk o, of a certain size easily ascertained ; a lens of a suitable focus

being then placed near the reflector, an image is formed of that opaque disk just
over the eyepiece-tube at X, and of such a size, when properly adjusted, that no

light can possibly enter the inner tube.

   Thus while not a single ray of light can by any possibility enter the inner tube,
a flood of light is sent down between the inner and outer tubes and directed upon
the four prisms in whatever angular position they may be.

    It only remains to say that both the intensity and colour of the light for both
characters of tlie illumination are under complete control of the observer while

actually observing.
--34 REPORT 1872.

   One other matter is perhaps worthy of note.
   The want of a convenient method of mapping nebulae or faint stars by a reticu-
lated diaphragm of bright lines in the field of view has long been felt, and the various
methods of using diamond scratches on glass or illuminated lines are subject to

Aobjection and troublesome to manage. simple method of using an image of such

a diaphragm instead of the actual diaphragm itself here suggests itself.
   Referring to the portion of the rays used for bright field illumination, and shown

in fig. 1, suppose the small diagonal mirror, E.', to be replaced by an equally small
prism having such a convex power that it forms an image of anj' object at the end
of the declination axis exactly in the same plane as the image found by the ob-
jective; then any kind of reticulated diaphragm of bright lines on the dark ground
can be placed on the end of the declination axis, which would have a suitably
prepared carrier for them, and their image would be seen iu the field of the
telescope of any colour and any intensity desired.

Je considere d'autant plus comme un plaisir de donner ici ce resume que 1'Asso-

ciation Britannique par I'organe de son illustre Pri§sident de I'aunee derniere m'avait

genereusemeut propose de se charger de mon voyage dans I'lnde pour le cas ou I'ex^-

cution de ce voyage eut rencontrt§ en France des difiicultes.

Heureusement notre Gouvernement comprit I'importance de ces questions scien-

tifiques et voulut faire les sacrifices necessaires ; mais je n'eu suis pas moins recon-

naissaut envers la savante Association.

  On salt que le but des expeditions etait de determiner la nature de la couronne

sur laquelle, malgr<5 les observations de 1869 et 1870, planaient encore bieu

des doutes.

  Le peu d'(5tendue que doit avou- cette note ne me permet pas d'examiner les
travaux ant^rieurs sur la couronne ni meme les resultats obtenus par les autres

observateurs le 12 Dec. 1871, je me bornerai a exposer mes observations per-

sonnel] es.

  Pour I'etude de ce grand probl^me de la couronne je me suls attache surtout

a r(5aliser deux conditions capitales.

   1°. Le choix d'une station oii le ciel fut d'une grande puret(S au moment du ph-

nomene.

2°. La realisation d'un instrument coUecteur de la lumiere tres-puissant de maniere

a obtenir un spectre tres-luuiiueux do la couronne (c'est le defaut de lumiere qui
jusqu'ici a induit en erreur sur la veritable constitution du spectre de la couronne).

Pour avoir un bon choix de la station je partis de France deux mois avant I'eclipse,

et je parcourus presque toutes les stations de la ligne centrale depuis Ceylon jusqu'a

la cote Malabar. Le massif montagneux des Neelgherry me parut ofirir les meilleures
conditions sous le rapport de la puretiS du ciel. En etudiant ces montagnes j'ai re-

marque que tons les matins, au lever du soleil, le vent s'^Ievait de I'orient et amenait

des nuages, mais que ce vent cessait bientot, en sorte que ces nuages s'arretaient et ne

couvraient que la portion orientale du massif. 11 resultait de cette remarque que les

chances etaient beaucoup plus grandes dans la ri^gion occidentale du massif. Je

Je viens maintenant aux instruments.

   L'etude des resultats obtenus en 1869 et 1870 m'avait d^montr^ que c'est le
manque d'intensite lumineuse des spectres de la couronne qui avait empeche d'ob-

tenir des resultats plus decisifs. Mes dispositions optiques eurent done pour but

d'obtenir un spectre de la couronne tres-lumiueux: j e construisis un telescope d'environ
40 centimetres de diametre, et 1°''43 de distance focale. Ce telescope donne des

images environ 16 fois plus lumineuses que celles d'une lunette astronomique ordi-

naire de meme ouverture. Le chercheur etait dispose de maniere que I'lm des yeux

   Enfin je pris des dispositions pom- r^aliser I'olDSCurit^ autour de moi pendant 1 ob-

maservation alin de conserver a  vue toute sa sensibilite.

   Voici maintenaut le resum(5 de I'observation de I'eclipse.

   Le 12 Ddcembre a Shoolor au lever du soleil les nuages arriverent comme d'babi-

tude et couvrireut leDodabetta; mais ils n'arriverent pas jusq^u'a nous, et nous eunies

un temps d'une puret^ admirable.
   La couronne se montra avec des formes et imo Constance d'aspect qui ne permet

pas de I'expliquer par la diflractiou.

   Le spectre des regions superieures de la coiu-onue moutra immediatement la raie
verte d(5ja signalee et si remarquable ; mais elle etait accompagn^e des raies de I'liy-

drogeue pales mais bieu perceptibles.

   Ainsi le spectre de la couronne n'est pas contiuu comme la plupart des observateura
de 1868, 09, 70, I'ont observe ; mais, meme dans les regions superieures il nous pre-

sente indtSpendammeut de la raie verte les principales raies de I'liydrogene.

   En avau^aut vers la base de la couronne le spectre gagnait en vivacite,^ les raies

Dde riiydrogeue s'accentuaient davautage. La raie obscure s'est nmioonnttreee.

   Dans le vert j 'en ai vu aussi quelques autres plus iines; mais cette vision etait a
la limite, ce qui s'explique tres-bieu, parce que j'avais ouvert la;Tente autant que
possible, mais de mauiere a voir toujoiu-s les principales raies du spectre solaire.

   Je pla^ai ensuite la fente de mani'ere a couper a la fois le disque de la lime, une

protuberance et diverses regions de la com-onne.

   Le ph(5nomene fut tres-beau et tres-concluant.

    Sur la luue, spectre tres-faible presentant les lignes de I'hydrogene tres-courtes,

tres-faibles, prolongeant les raies tres-vives de la protuberance.

   La protuberance ne donnait pas la raie verte, tandis que cette raie commen?ait

Dimmediatement au-dessus dans la couronne ; eufin la raie fut aussi visible.

   D'autres observations confirmerent ces residtats pour le spectre de la couronne.

   La polarisation de la couronne est vive, elle est radiale et a son maximum d'in-

tensite a quelques minutes de la cbromosphere.

   Ce r^sultat explique comment quelques observateurs ont trouv4 la Imniere de la
com-onne non polarisee : c'est qu'ils interrogeaieut des parties de la couronne tres-
voisines de la ciiromosph ere, la ou I'l^mission propre I'emporte sur la reflexion. ^ Mais

plus liaut remission etant plus faible, la reflexion devient perceptible, et c'est la aussi

qu'on trouve les raies obscures du spectre solaire.

   En resume. II parait aujom-d'hui dt5montri5 par les observations de 1869, 1870,

1871:

   Que le pbenomene de la couronne des (Eclipses totales est du a ime enveloppe ga-

   Que le gaz hydrogene en forme un element principal
   Que cette enveloppe gazeuse n'est nullement dans im etat statique, mais qu'elle

   The errors of tlie refraction tables are best shown by noticing the variations in
the North Polar Distances of stars observed with the Greenwich Transit-circle ae
determined by observations of different nights. They are sometimes very con-
siderable. Humidity is doubtless one of the most important points to be attended
to. But this correction is difficult to appl}', for its value is at present unknown.
The author wished to point out a minor correction, which, however, becomes im-
portant in some cases, which can be easily determined, and which, so far as he

Knows, has not been hitherto alluded to. This is the effect due to a difference in
the heiyht of the atmosphere at adjacent stations on the meridian (if a meridian
instrument be used), as shown by the barometer. The superabundant air will act

as a prism of air, and may possibly introduce sensible errors.
   The theory of correcting for this is as follows :

    Li the difterenrtial eq^uation to the path of a ray, viz.

                                   dr=-!^ tan i,

i is the inclination of the ray to the normal to a surface of equal density (the sur-

faces of equal density being supposed to be concentric). J3ut in the case considered,
where the barometer varies at adjacent stations, tlie surface of the earth is not a

surface of equal density, but is inclined to it, so that the sections of the surface of
equal density and the surface of the earth, by a plane in the meridian, include an
angle a, which can be easily tabulated for different values of the barometric differ-
ences. Hence, in using Bessel's refraction tables, where the argument is the angle

i, we ought to use, not the observed zenith-distance Z, but the angle Z+a.
   By comparing good observations at stations five miles apart, the author found that

the barometers sometimes differed by O'OIO inch. The effect of this difference on the

places of stars is as follows :

Tor stars whose zenith-distance is 60 the coiTection is about 0-2

>}                               !> 80 ,,         ,, 1-0

                                   90 ,,          ,, 200

These effects then are very sensible. Nor is it likely that the barometer obser-

vations compared are exceptional.

The existence of this source of error was clearly detected in the Greenwich

observations, by comparing them with observations of the barometer at adjacent

stations. Every test that has been apj^lied confirms the opinion that, by the appli-

cation of tliis correction, a considerable increase of accuracy would be obtained in

stars of great zenith-distance.

          The Action of Sunligld on Colourless and Coloured Glass,
                            Bij Thomas Gaffield, of Boston.

The author's experiments on this subject, of which some accounts have appeared

in American and European scientific journals, cover a period of nine years, and

--embrace some eighty ditierent lands of glass, of English, French, German, Belgian,

and American manufacture, of rough and polished plate, crown, and sheet window

glass, of Hint and crown optical glass,'of opal and ground glass, of coloured pot-

metal, flashed and stained glass of various colours, of glass ware, and glass in the
rough metal. They were carried on chiefly upon the window-sills and roof of the

author's house in iBoston, in a position exposed to the full force of the sun's raya

during the whole or gTcater portion of every day, only being protected by covers

in the event of snow-storms.

The usual size of the glasses exposed is four by two inches, and several himdred

specimens show the efiect of sunlight in producing a change of colour by exposure

from one day in summer to several years. These changes in the colourless glasses

are from white to yellow, from green to yellowish green, from brownish yellow

to purple, from greenish white to bluish white, and from bluish white to a darker

blue. By the colours of colourless glass are meant those which are seen in looking

through the edges of the glass. They are not noticed in looking at the surface in
our windows, unless a white curtain furnishes a contrasting background.

It is a curious fact that, while these various glasses before exposure can be sub-

mitted to great heat in a glass-stainer's kiln without any change, all the exposed

and changed specimens can be restored to their original colour by being placed in
Athe same kiln during a single Are.
                                     second exposure to sunlight will reproduce

the same yellow and purple colours as before ; and this process of coloration by

light and decolorization by heat can be carried on indefinitely.

During the last year, the author commenced an experiment with pot-metals, not

of the primary colours, but of the intermediate ones, which most nearly approach

tliose produced in colourless glass by sunlight exposure. In every specimen of the

brownish, j^ellowish, and rose or purple colours thus exposed, astonishing chano-ea

in colour or shade in a short time were observed. In some instances a few daj's
of exposure in the month of June of the present year sufficed to show the com-
mencement of the Sim's influence. These changes were from a coffee-colour to a
rose, from amber, yellowish, brownish, and purple to darker shades of the same

colours.

   Inasmuch as this class of pot-metal colours was used in the painted windows of
past ages, and as flashed and stained colours are subject to change in the colour-
less body of the glass, may not this series of experiments go far to solve many

interesting questions regarding the alleged superiority of the old cathedral glass ?

The fact of coloration or change of colour or shade by sunlight being established,
must we not transfer some of our praise for the old artists in glass to the wonderful

pencil of the brightest luminary of the heavens, which, during the centuries, has

noiselessly but unceasingly been at work, deepening and mellowing the colours
of all the windows of the venerable cathedrals of the world ?

   Exactly what this wonderful alchemy is, and what are the methods of its
operation, are questions on which various opinions may be given, but which only
a careful consideration and comparison of the observations and theories of many
different scientific men can accurately decide. Some have attributed it to the pre-

sence of oxide of ii-on, some to arsenic, and some to sulphur in the constituent

materials of the glass. Some think oxide of manganese (singular as it may seem

used as a decolorizer) to be the great colourist in this matter. The author thinks
that in many coloured and colourless glasses it plays a very important part in the
effects produced. But in some experiments made with glasses containing no man-

ganese, decided changes of colour from greenish to yellowish have been produced.

Perhaps the question cannot be accurately solved until some glass-manufacturer

will make, with great care and for this special purpose, a series of specimens of
colourless and coloured glass, which shall be exposed for months and years to the

38 REPORT--1872.

   Since the publication of the results of the author's first experiments, made in
1863, there has been quite a change in the original colour of some of the -n-indow
glass made in Europe. Tlie author imderstauds that many of the manufactui-era
have given up the use of oxide of manganese, or reduced the quantity employed.
The result is, tliat the brownish-yellow coloured glass, which used to change to a
pm-ple hue in a year or less, is now replaced by a light bluish green, which shows
little or no change after years of exposure. It will be a practical result of the
inquiry suggested above, if colourless glass of all kinds shall be made which shall
not change in colour by sunlight exposure, and but slightly in shade. Especially
is it important to photogTaphers, in any operations requiring all the light which
they can obtain, not to have glass in their skylights which, after a few months or
years of exposure, shall be robbed of a great proportion of its power to transmit
the chemical or actinic rays, by a change to a j'ellow or purple hue, which, in
time, might cut off almost as much actinic effect as if it were ground or covered
with enamel on one of its surfaces. The author made some photographic experi-
ments to show this deteriorating effect, by exposing sensitive paper under glasses
of original colour, and those of the same kind clianged by sunlight, and witnessing

the very perceptibly different shades of darkening produced.

   This action of sunlight must not be confounded with rust or stain occasioned by
exposure to atmospheric influences, which occasions sometimes a roughening and
sometimes an iridescence upon the surface ; while sunlight action, which has no
disintegrating effect on the outside, extends throughout the body of the glass.

On the Spectrum of Hydrogen. By Aethtje ScnrsTEK.

Hydi'Ogen is one of the gases said to exhibit more than one spectrum. Under a

pressure greater than about o millimetres it is said to show a spectrum of shaded

bands. The spectrum of hydrogen which is seen in the heavenly bodies appears

under a pressure from 5 millimetres down to the lowest pressure which can be ob-

tained by Sprengel's pump, where a new spectrum of lines suddenly appears.
Plucker, who discovered the band-spectrum of hydrogen, was first of the opinion

that it was due to the last traces of air. Finding, however,Qthat its bands did not

coincide with the bands of air, he attributed it to hydrogen. Angstrom has recently

given his reasons against this supposition, and believes it^, to be due to acetylene.

My own experiments have led to the confirmation of Angstrom's opinion. Gene-

rally two distinct causes may introduce a hj-drocarbon into the vacuum-tube :

1. The gas passing through india-rubber tubes will carry with it small pieces of

india-rubber.

2. All the vacuum-tubes are more or less greasy.

These two causes I consider sufiicient to produce all the effects obsened

by Pliicker. Wiillner, however, found this spectrum so well developed that

we must look in his experiments for a more constant soiu-ce of error. This,

I believe, is found in the greased stopcocks which he used to shut his vacuum-

tubes. Examining the spectrum of oxygen, he discovered two new spectra

·which he found later to be due to carbon-compounds introduced into his vacuum-

tubes by the grease of the stopcocks. The quantity of solid matter carried
away by a current of air passing through an india-rubber tubing is not so

small as might at first sight appear. Tyndall, in his experiments on actinic

clouds, mentions the effect produced by an india-rubber joint through which the

gas, subjected to examination, had passed. In order to eliminate the eflect of the

tubings, a drop of water was introduced into the vacuum-tube, which was boiled

after the vacuum had been made. When all the air was expelled the spark was
allowed to pass. It was now found that the band-spectrum varied much with

the different tubes. ,, Those which had been well cleaned before being used showed it

only very feebly. Angstrom's supposition that this spectrimi is due to acetylene is

therefore very plausible.
--AI obtained the spectrum of ammonia by the following arrangement :
                                                                      few drops

of a strong solution of ammonia in water were introduced into the vacuum-tube,

and the induction-current was allowed to pass while the pump was being worked.

Thu3 a vacuum is obtained sufficient to allow tlie passage of the current, and at

the same time the gas is constantly renewed, which prevents its decomposition.
The spectrum of ammonia consists of a broad gi-eenish-yellow band, the wave-length
of which was determined by interpolation to be 5G86 to 5G27 10th metres.

  Having no Sprengel's pump at my disposal, I could not examine hydrogen under

the conditions in which it is said to give a third spectrum : suffice it to say that

Pliicker haSoCxamined it under those circumstances, and does not mention any new
spectrum. Angstrom has shown that all the lines of this spectrum coincide with

lines of sidphur (which might be introduced by the caoutchouc tubings). Wiillner

says that the general appearance of the sulphur-spectrum is a different one ; but

this may be due to the cn-cumstance that the sulphur-spectrum was never examined

under so minute a pressure,

On tJie Application of Photocjraphy to copy Diffraction-gratings.

                       By the Hon. J. "W. Steutt.

Great interest has always attached itself to the beautiful phenomena discovered

by Frauenhofer, which present themselves when a beam of light falls on a surface

rided with a great number of parallel and equidistant lines. Their unexpected

character, the brilliant show of colour, and the ready explanation of the main points

on the principles of the Wave-theory recommend them to all, while the working

phj'sicist recognizes in them the key ^to the exact measurement of wave-lengths,

·which has been so splendidly used by Angstrom and others.

The production, however, of gratings of sufficient fineness and regularity is a

matter of no ordinary difficulty. Indeed the exactness required and obtained is

almost incredible. The wave-lengths of the two sodium-lines differ by about the

thousandth part. If in two gratings, or two parts of the same grating, the average

interval between the divisions differed by the fraction, the less refrangible sodium-

line of one would be superposed on the more refrangible corresponding to the other.

In point of fact the gratings ruled by Nobert of Barth, to whom the scientific

world has been greatly indebted, are capable of distinguishing a difference of wave-

length probably of a tenth part of that above mentioned. But in order that the
U-lines may be resolved at all, there must be no average error (running over a

large part of the grating) of -[ oVr P^i"* of the inten'al between consecutive lines.

When it is remembered what the interval is (from ^-jVo to o-oWof f^i inch, or even

less), the degree of success which has been reached seems very remarkable.

 A --work requiring so much accuracy is necessarily costly the reason, probably,

why gratings tit to be used with the telescope for the purpose of showing the fixed

lines are comparatively rare. The hope of being able to perfect a process for the

reproduction of gratings at a comparatively cheap rate has induced the author to

return at the first opportunity to the experiments described in a Preliminary Note

read before the Royal Society in June last. Although the subject is as yet by no

means exhausted, the author thought it worth while to bring before the Association

an account of the progress that has been made, with specimens of the results.
AThe method of procedure is very simple.
                                          dry plate prepared by any photo-

graphic process on a.Jlat surface of glass or other transparent material not affected by

the fluid media employed is brought into contact with the ruled sm'face of the grating

in a printing-frame, and exposed to light. In the author's first experiments he used

exclusively as a source of light the image of the sun in a lens of short focus placed

in the shutter of a darkened room ; but so small a source is not necessary. The light

from the clouds or sky reflected hy a mirror through a hole several inches in aperture

will be sufficiently concentrated if the frame be a few feet distant. The author has

not as yet specially investigated the point, but he believes that if the light be too

--much diffused, the experiment would tail. Much would, no doubt, depend on the

perfection of the contact an elemeJit verj" likely to vary. The variable intensity

of diffused daylight, which it is almost impossible to estimate with precision, has

induced him to use exclusively in his later experiments with ordinary photographic

plates the light of a moderator lamp. This, with globe removed, is placed at a

distance of 1 or 2 feet from the printing-frame, the distance being carefully

measured. Working in this way there is little difficulty in giving consecutive

Aplates any relative exposure that may be required.        collateral advantage is the

possibility of operating at any time of the day or night.

With regard to the preparation of the plates, the author has latterly been using

Athe tannin process introduced by Major Russell.  preliniinarj^ coating with dilute

albumen is generally advisable, as any loosening of the film from the glass must be

avoided on account of the distortion that it might introduce. In some states of the

collodion an edging of black varnish put on after the exposure is sufficient to hold

the film down. The glasses, after being coated with collodion (Mawson's was

used), are immersed as usual in the silver bath, and then allowed to soak in disjilled

water, best contained in a dippiug-bath. They are then washed under a tap for

about half a minute, and put into the tannin solution (about 15 grains to the ounce)

held, in the author's practice, in a small dish. The author usually prepares his

plates in the evening, standing them up to dry on blotting-paper. In the morning

they are in a fit state for use. Artificial heat might no doubt be used if a more rapid

drying were desired.

At a distance of 1 foot from the lamp tlie exposure required is four or five

minutes. The development is the most critical part of the process. The pyrogallic

--solution should contain plenty of acid (acetic or citric), and its action must not be

pushed too far the mistake wliich a photogTapher accustomed to negative work is

most likely to make. At this stage the spectra given by a candle-flame are not

very brilliant, on account of the iodide of silver still covering the parts which are to

be transparent. Any trace of fog is especially to be avoided. The author has expe-

rienced advantage in many cases from a solution of iodine in iodide of potassium

applied to the film previouslj' to fixing ; but its action must be carefully watched, or

too much silver will be converted. The iodide of silver is then cleared away with

hyposulphite of soda or cyanide, followed by a careful washing under the tap.

With regard to the gelatine copies, the author has not much to add to the account

read before the Royal Bocietj'. The process is very simple and some of the results

very perfect, but he has not hitherto succeeded in sufficiently mastering the details.

Plates apparently treated in precisely the same manner turned out very diflerently.

That difficulties should arise is not yery extraordinaiy, considering the novelty of

the method ; but it is curious that some of the very first batch prepared are among

the best yet produced. The value of the results is so great, tliat the author has no

intention of abandoning his attempts, and perseverance must at last secm-e success.

The author then said a few words about the performance and prospects of the

new copies. Their defining power on the fixed lines in the solar spectrum is all that

could be desired, being, so far as he can see, in no way inferior to the originals. In

the third spectrum the 3000 to the circle-gratings show the line between the D's,

if the otlier optical arraiu/emoits are suiiahlc. The fourth line of the group h is di-

stinguished with^the utmost ease. Theauthor isnot sufficiently familiar with spectro-

scopic worlc to make an (?xact comparison, but presumes that two prisms of C0° at

least would be required to eftect as much. The authorishere speaking of photogi'aphs

on worked glass. With ordinary patent plate, although veiy good results may be ob-

tained if tested by the naked eye onlj^, it is a great chance whether the magnifying-

power of a telescope will not reveal the imperfect character of the surface.
   With direct sunlight the light is abundantly sufficient ; but it is here in all

probability that the weak point of gratings lies, 'it should be distinctly understood

that where light is deficient gratings will not compete with prisms. There are

cases, however, where the scale might h& turned by the opacity of all highly dis-

persive substances to the rays under examination. Even if glass be retained as the
substratum, it may be used in a very thin layer, while prisms are essentially thick.

The immense advantage of a diffi-action-specitrum for the investigation of dark heat

need not here be insisted on. Taking all things into consideration, it is probable

that photographed gratings will supersede prisms for some purposes, though

certainly not for all.

The specimens exhibited by Mr. Ladd are copies of two gi'atings by Nobert,

each of a square inch in surface, the one containing 3000 and the other 6000 lines.
The latter cost about £20.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  41

On Atmosplierk Beffaction of Inclined Rays, and on the Path of a Level Ray.

  3y James Thomson, LL.D., Professor of Civil Enciineering in Queen's

     College, Belfast.

   Many years ago, in considering, from a civil-engineering point of vle-w, the patli

of a level or nearly level ray of light through the atmosphere, with special refer-
ence to corrections in observations -ndth the levelling-instrument, the author found
himself unable to rest satisfied with the views put forward on the subject in books
on Practical Geodesy, or in any writings with which he was acq^uainted. The only
views which he then met with were to the following efl'ect :

   The atmosphere was regarded as consisting of an infinite number of infinitely thin
horizontal laminae, with a gradual increase of density in passing downwards through
these laminse, so that the density in each lamina would differ only in an infinitely

small degree from that in the one immediately above it, or from "that in the one
immediately below it. It was then inferred that a ray of light, passing obliquely
downwards through the laminaj, must, at each successive transition from one lamina

into the denser one next below, sufi'er refraction so that its course must make a less
angle with a normal to the laminre in the denser lamina than it did with the same
normal in the rarer one immediately above, and that the path of the ray must
therefore be curved with the concave side downwards. From this reasoning, with-
out noticing that its whole foundation, in oblique transition of the light across

laminae with gradual change of density in those successive!}' traversed, vanishes in
the case of a horizontal ray, authors have tacitly assumed that a ray proceeding
through the atmosphere, so as to enter a levelling-instrument horizontally, should
be expected to be curved with its underside concave. In one sense such a conclu-

--sion, in connexion with the mode stated in which it has been inferred, may be

partly justified that is, if the consideration be that a ray coming from a consider-
able distance so as to enter an instrument horizontally must have previously been
descending obliquely through the nearly spherical level laminre of the air which are
rounded in correspondence with the figure of the earth. Rays arriving level at an
observer's station from the rising or setting sun afford an instance of what is here
referred to, and one in which the light has descended obliquely through the whole

depth of the atmosphere. It may readily be admitted, from the usual reasoning

cited above, that any such ray will be curved and concave downwards at all parts
of its course where it is sensibly descending ; but as the advancing ray gradually
approaches to the level position with a gradual diminution down to cessation of
oblique descent through the lamina, it might still, so far as that reasoning would
indicate, be held an open question whether the curvature of the ray would approach
towards zero, or whether it would approach towards a maximum, or generally
what might be the condition as to cuv^ature or straightness of the ray, as the ray
comes to be level.

   The author proposed the question in 186.3 to Professor Purser, of Queen's Col-
lege, Belfiist ; and Prof. Purser, on the moment, made out an analytical investiga-
tion which depended on the proportionality of the sine of the angle of incidence to
the sine of the angle of refraction holding good for infinitely thin laminaj differing
infinitely little in densit}', and holding good to the extreme case in which the ray
becomes parallel to the lamina?. This investigation appeared to the author of the
present paper to be consistent with all physical conditions ; and he regarded it as an
hypothesis likely to be full}' confirmed by experimental investigations, if at any
time experiments bearing on the subject should be found practicable. From direct
experiments, however, on the curvature of a ray of light in the atmosphere, no
accurate results are to be hoped for, on account of the great and constantly varying
disturbances to which the ray is subject, through changes in the distribution of heat
and moisture in the air, and movements of its parts among one another, and other

varying influences.

    Prof. Purser's investigation, which from the first has been deemed by the author
of tlie present paper to be of much interest and value, was to the following eflPect, the

 question being :

     la find ic/wthcr a ray of liylit 2)nssi)iy iiijinitcly nearly horizontally throuyh the

of light directed level so that if it -were to traverse a sti-aight path it would pass
along an infinitely thin lamina of uniform density, hut with less density above and
greater below, tcouhl he lent hy virtue of the difference of the densities above and

below it.
   It must, however, be admitted that there is somethiug perplexing, or not quite

satisfactoi-y to the mind, in taking this final step to the     perfectly level  ray                 for as
                                                                                                  ;

soon as the inclination of the ray becomes zero the whole foundation and frame-

work of the investigation fails, there being then no oblique passage of a ray from

one lamina into another, no incident and no refracted ray, and consequently no

ratio of sines of angles of incidence and refraction; though all these would be

required to be discussed as if they existed in the case of every ray whose curvature

is to be compared with that of any other. Still, as both Professor Purser and the

author thought at the time, the investigation made the physical conclusion as to

level I'ays seem highly probable ; since, i'f it proves, as it seems to do, that a ray of
light descending obliquely must move along a certain curved path, and tliat the
curvature must increase as the inclination approaches towards horizontality, and
also that the rate of change of curvature with cliange of inclination approaches
towards zero as the inclination approaches towards horizontality, it must follow that
a ray of light passing exactly level will be bent with the same ciuwature as one in-

finitely nearly level.

   Several years later (in February 1870) a new investigation occurred to the author
of the present paper. The new one is much simpler, and it is more general, and its

reasoning holds good alike for level as for inclined rays. In fact the previous
investigation, founded on the ratio of the sines of angles of incidence and refraction,

and therefore in principle having no direct applicability to level rays, comes, when
considered in connexion with the new one, to be a case of this more general one,

seeing that under the undulatorj'- theory of light the proportionality of the sines of
the angles of incidence and refraction is not an ultimate fact or principle, but a
consequence of retardation of the velocity of light in the denser medium. In the

new investigation which will now be submitted the retardation of the velocity of

light in the denser medium is taken as the basis of the reasoning.
M NLet
        and P be two level surfaces in the atmosphere, and let each of these

be supposed to pass through air of uniform density throughout each of them. They

may be conceived to be at a very small distance apart,

and then obviously a ray in descending obliquely from               Fig. 2.

one to the other will alter its cuiwature only by a very

slight amount.

The fimdamental assumptions on which the investi-

gation will be based are the following three :

  A(1) It is assumed that the light at has a certain

velocity, which may be called i\, and that the light at B,

where the air is denser, has a smaller velocity, which

may be called v^,

(2) It is assumed that these velocities are constant

for all inclinations of the ray of light ; or, in other words,

that the velocity of the ray of light is independent of the

inclination of the ray to the horizontal strata of the air.

   (3) It is assumed that the direction of tlie light is per-
pendicular to the wave front, or that a surface taken

crossing every ray in a pencil of rays perpendicularly,

and then conceived to advance along the course of each

ray with the velocitj' of that ray, will continue to cross

every ray perpendicularly.

or curvature cc cos ^ ; wWch shows that the curvature is a maximum when 6=0,

that is, when the ray is level, and that the curvature diminishes to zero as the ray

becomes vertical.

The result here brought out, - = tri!? . cos 6,

is perfectly in agreement with that arrived at in the previous investigation of Prof,

=Purser, namely - H---- sin /, seeing that sin i is =cos 6, and that, according to

the undulatory theory of light as confirmed by experimental proofs, it is known

that v^ : v.^ : : n : I, so that E1III2 n^ugt \^q equal to tZi}. The new method has

however, the advantage of quite clearing away the perplexity involved in the other
by the collapse of the reasoning when brought to the extreme case of the level ray.
In the new method no such collapse occurs ; and, in fact, the new method shows
clearly how the real fundamental principle (that of retardation of velocity in the
denser medium, on which the bending depends, and which holds good quite as much

for level rays as for any others) is allowed in the previous in^estigatiou gradually to
fade out of the reasoning, till, in the case of the level ray, it has absolutely vanished
from the conditions which were taken into account. The previous method, like the
modes of considering the subject of atmospheric bending of rays which appear to
have been most generally entertained hitherto, took a consequence of the important
fundamental principle into account instead of the principle itself (that consequence
being the proportionality of sines of angles of incidence and refraction in case of
oblique transition of ligli't from one lamina to anotlier of different density) ; but that
consequence happens to be not so general as the principle from which it'foUows, and
to be one which becomes nugatory or non-existent in the case of the level ray.

   In concluding, the author wishes to state that it seemed to him rather unlikely
that so simple a view of the influence of the atmosphere in effecting the bending o"f

rays of light as that which he has now offered could be quite new. He thought

that others better acquainted with the science of light than he is must most probably

have entertained the same or similar views. He has therefore made inquiries as to

the views which have hitherto been put forward regarding the bending of light in
the atmosphere and in other mediums of continuously variable index of refraction,

or, as they may be better considered in the present investigation, mediums
of continuously varying light-velocity*. Much has been written on the sub-

ject in general, and on various particular cases of its application ; and views
very similar in principle with those here offered appear in various ways to
have been entertained, or implied more or less explicitly ; but he ha-s not learned
of anything having been taught which has anticipated the treatment of the subject
at present offered so as to deprive it altogether of novelty and interest. The subject,
he believes, has been very generally considered under imperfect views ; and he will
think a good result will have ensued if his drawing- the attention of the British
Association to it will serve to elicit from others notice of the best views that ha\o.
hitherto either been fully published, or have been entertained or discussed without
complete publication.

Professor Maxwell, in 1853, sent to the ' Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical

Journal ' a problem about the path of a ray in a medium in which

                                                                                                                         ''-^+?'

where jUf, and a are constant, and r is the distance from a fixed point. Such rays,
he points out, move in circles. This problem, he mentions, was intended to illus-

trate the fact that the principal focal length of the crystalline lens of the eye is

very much shorter than anatomists calculate it, from the curvature of its surface and

the index of refraction of its substance. The reason, he shows, is the increase of

density towards the centre of the lens, so that the rays pass nearly tangentially

through a place where the density is varying. Also, in the Cambridge Exauiina-

tious for 1870, Prof Maxwell set a question about the conditions of a horizoutal

Aray of light having a greater curvature than that of the earth.                                                                                                                     great deal, Jie

says, has been written about atmospheric refraction by Bessel, Clairaut, and others ;
and a question has been set on it iu January of every year at Cambridge for several

years back, so that the subject has been much discussed in various ways; but, he

says, the mode of treatment of the subject in the present paper does not seem to

--have been anticipated. J. Thomson.

On a Phenomenon connected loith Diffraction. By T. Ogiek AVaed, M.D. Oxon.

   The author has observed that when he stands at sunset on a hill at such a dis-
tance from another hill that his shadow reaches its vanishing-point before arriving
at it, instead of a shadow there is diffused light, due to diftractiou, more or less in

extent in proportion to the distance, and that this light does not disappear until

the observer has descended 22° into the shadow of the hill. He throws out the

supposition that the bright sky 22° round the sun has a similar power to produce
dift'raction, and asks whether the sun's corona can be merely this diffracted light,
and suggests that dming the progress of an annular eclipse the unshadovred portions
of the earth ought to receive an extra portion of light from the diffi-acted light sur-
rounding the shadow of the moon.

           On tJie Imjyortance of the Salts of Uranium in PhotograjfJiij.

                             By Colonel Stuart Wortley.

The great advantage of obtaining photographic negatives by means of a sensitive

emulsion in lieu of using the collodion and bath separately is beginning to be gene-

rally recognized by those who take au interest in the advance of scientific photo-

graphy. The advantages obtained by this method of working are, first, that the

condition of one substance alone, viz. the sensitive emulsion, has to be considered

and, secondly, that a greater degree of sensitiveness can be obtained than by the

bath process.

In order to obtain this exalted degi'ee of sensitiveness with an emulsion it is ne-

cessary, after the formation of a certain amount of bromide of silver, to saturate the

emulsion with as much free nitrate of silver as it will hold in solution. This prin-

ciple has been recognized by all the most advanced workers since the author first drew

attention to such conditions being required iu a paper read before the London

1872.                                                                                                                                                                                      5

--Pliotograpbic Society in Juue of last year. But one difficulty opposed itself to the

obtaining of good results -with certainty the difficulty of coutrolliug the excess of
nitrate of silver from lapsing into an over-sensitive state, and thus causing what in

photographic ;j«;V««re is called "fog."

   To remedy this state of things, and to have the power of producing a sensitive
emulsion that shall keep for months in perfect working order, by adding something
to the emulsion that shall exercise a controlling power over the free nitrate of silver,
was the problem which the author set himself to work out, and he has been fortu-
nate enough to achieve a complete success.

   The author had been familiar with the fact that a mixture of the nitrates of silver
and uranium in solution would retain for years their sensitiveness to light without
theirgood qualities being in any way impaired; and it occurred to him that the addition
of the nitrate of another metal to that of silver in the sensitive bromized emulsion
would give us the power which we wanted of being able to keep a large excess of
nitrate of silver from the decomposition which apparently resulted in fog.

   In order to make an emulsion collodion which shall have an exalted sensitiveness,
and which shall retain all its excellencies unimpaired for months, the author has,
after forming therein a certain amount of bromide of silver, add the nitrates of silver
and iiraniu.ni 'together to the emulsion in certain definite proportions. The result
is the formation of a highly sensitive mixture in which no change whatever occurs
for a period of certainly three months ; and this result cannot be obtained by any
means other, so far as he is aware, than by the addition of the nitrate of another
metal. The author has tried various other nitrates with perfect success, but has
selected and recommended the nitrate of m-anium as having, on the whole, gi-eater
advantages than anv other nitrate with which he is acquainted.

    This sensitive emulsion is also of very great value for the preparation of sensitive
photographic films to be used in a dry state. These films, prepared with a collodion
containing bromide and excess of nitrate of silver (the latter being controlled by

the presence of nitrate of uranium), can now be prepared with certainty to have a

sensitiveness equal to the best wet collodion sensitized in a bath ; and the use of
nitrate of uranium gives them the extraordinary advantage of retaining their ex-
quisite sensitiveness unimpaired for any reasonable time ; and they will bear after
light has impressed a picture upon them the delay of months previous to the deve-
lopment of the invisible impression.

   It is with the special object of pointing out how important to the cause

of science in distant lands such photogTaphic dry plates ma_y become that the
author introduced the subject, as he caimot but feel that if naturalists, geo-
logists, and botanists in distant lands can secure records from day to day on sensi-
tive photographic plates which need not be developed till they return from their
expedition, a new power will be placed in the hands of scientific travellers of which,
he thinks, they will not be slow to avail themselves.

   The author is enabled to speak with great confidence on this point, having himself

exposed some of these sensitive dry films in the beginning of May of this year, and
which have only now (the middle of August) had the latent image developed,

and that without any deterioration whatever.
    As, moreover, dry films prepared according to the manner the anther has indicated

appear to be entirely tmaft'ected by gi'eat heat, they will be of value in explorations
in tropical countries, where anj' other known method of photography would be a

great difficulty, if not a real impossibility.

On tJie VelocUij of Light in tJte Chemical Elements, and on their Crystalline

  Form. By Ch. V. Zengee, Professor in the Polytechnic School in Prague.

The theory of vibratory motion is in strict accord with experiment in the case

of sotmd and its propagation. It was from the analogy between light and sound that

hysicists ascribed the same laws of motion to both, representing their velocities

ly the same equation,  _

e being the elasticity nnd d the density of luminous ether ; but there were no
means of giving a physical and numerical interpretation of the elasticity and density

of ether in certain retracting media.

   The index of refraction n is, according to the law of Brewster, equal to the tan-
gent of the angle of polarization-maximum (3 ; hence

                                        tan /3=M = \/fi.

   Conceiving the luminous phenomena as produced by molecular vibrations, the
densitj' of tlie luminous ether must be represented by the density or distance of
atoms (»·), or be a function of it, viz.

   It is a fact, confirmed by vai-ious experiments, that by mechanical pressure, by
imequal heating, and by other means augmenting or diminishing the distance of
atoms, the velocity of light undergoes a sensible change, isotropical refractive media
becoming even doubly refracting. This confirms the supposition that the velocity
of light is in connexion with the atomic distances.

   It is obvious that there can be no great difference of elasticity in the case of a more
rapid vibratoiy motion than heat is; and if we suppose the elasticity of atoms to be
the same in both cases for the propagation of light and heat, there can be no essential
error in that hypothesis as to the value or amount of elasticity. Supposing, therefore,
elasticity of atoms to be proportional to, or identical with, the specific heat for light

and heat, we get

         Vs

where s denotes the specific heat of the chemical element, v the velocity, and n the
index of refraction of light.

   As to the form of the function r, the simplest supposition may be tried putting
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

therefore

stitiites a vrra causa adequate to maintain the Vertical Circulation advocated by the

Author. The /«f/s ot" the case, as determined by recent Deep-sea Temperature

observations, made for the most part with Tliermometers protected against pressure,

are as follows :

1. In hig-h Northern Latitudes the temperature of the surface of the Sea, near the

border of the Ice-barrier, is but little above ^2'^ F. ; and at small depths below the

surface, according to the recent observations of Payer and \\'eyprecht, it falls below

32°. Making allowance for the known influence of pressure upon tlie thermometers

with which temperature-observations at great depths have been made in these

--regions, there is every reason to believe that save in cases in which the tempera-
--ture of the upper stratum may be modified by local causes there is a progressive

descent from -32° to 29° or even lower; so that the average temperature of the entire

column of Polar Water may be considered to be not above 30°.

2. In lower Latitudes the temperature of the surface of the Sea is gTeatly influ-

enced by Solar radiation ; but the superheathu/ thus produced does not generally

extend in a marked degree much below 100 fathoms. Beneath this is a stratum of
which the temperature may be said to range from about 52° to 4o° in aU but the

highest Latitudes ; but the depth of this stratum varies considerably, being about

400 fathoms near the Faroe Banks, about 700 fathoms off the coast of Portugal,

and 1000 or 1200 fathoms nearer the Equator.

   3. Beneath this stratum is a " stratum of intermixture," in which the Thermo-

--meter falls rapidly, sometimes as much as 10° in 200 fathoms ; and below this the

temperature again becomes more uniform, sinking very gradually from 39° or 38° to

35° or even to 32°, at depths of more than 2000 fathoms, even under the Equator.

 --4. Thus the Intertropical column may be regarded as consisting of: (1 ) a super-

heated stratum, of which the temperature ranges fi-om 84° at the surface to 52° at

200 fathoms                                                            (2) an  upper  warm stratum of (say) 1000  fathoms depth,  of which
                                                                    ;

the temperatm-e ranges from 52° to 45° (3j a stratum of intermixture of about 200
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

fathoms depth, in which the thermometer falls from 45° to 39° ; and (4) of a cold

stratum, occupying the whole of the deeper portion of the great Oceanic basins

beneath 1400 fathoms, its temperature falling with increase of depth, so that in its

deepest portion the thermometer has been seen as low as 32°. The average of the

entire column may thus be about 45°.

  Now as <S»«-water progressively diminishes in bulk and increases in specific

gravity down to its freezing-point, it is maintained by the Author that, supposing

the Polar and Intertropical columns to be equal in height, the excess of weight in

the former will produce a lateral pressin-e at its lower portion, which will occasion

an outflow of Polar Water along the floor of the ocean towards the Equator ; this
deep outflow, by loAvering the surface, will produce an indraught of water into the

Polar area, which, in its tmn, will acquire by cooling the same excess of Specific

Gravity, thus producing a continual dowmvarcl movement ; whilst, on the other

hand, the cold outflow, being subject to the heating influence of the crust of the

Earth beneath and of the warmer water above, will be gradually thinned as it

passes towards the Equator, so as to lie at a greater and greater depth beneath the
surface. As the continual deep outflow of Polar Water will produce a superficial

indraught into the Polar area, and nixist ultimately derive its supply from the sur-

face of the Intertropical sea, there will be a continual movement of the upper

stratum from the Intertropical towards the Polar area : and as the last-arrived
Polar Water will always be colder than that which preceded it, the former will

take its place beneath the latter, so that there will be a continual upward movement

of the water in the Intertropical area. Of this upward movement of colder water

from below, a very curious indication has lately been obtained in the fact that off

the West Coast of Africa the temperature of the Sea at 200 fathoms is about 5°

lower over a bottom deep enougli to be covered by the Polar outflow, than it is

over a bottom of only 700 or 800 fathoms depth.

The doctrine of a Vertical Circulation advocated by the Author was long since

suggested by Pouillet as the best explanation of the facts then known in regard to

Ocean-temperature; but was put aside through the general acceptance of the doc-

trine of a uniform Deep-sea temperature of 39^^ F., which was supposed to have

been established by Sir James Ross's observations, and which was adopted and

promulgated by Sir Johu Herscliel. The coiTections supplied by more recent arid
trustworthy observations have afforded a new set of data ; on the basis of which it
has been argued by the Author that such a Circulation tnust necessarily talis place
under the conditions above specified, and that it gives an adequate scientific ratio-
nak for the facts determined by observation.

   This view, however, though accepted by Sir John Herschel shortly before his
death, has been contested by Mr. James CroU; but his argument is directed,
not against the doctrine advocated by the Author, but against a doctrine set up by
himself. Instead of regarding the level of the Polar and Equatorial columns as the
same, and considering what will be the effect of their difference of gravity, he
estimates the difference of level which would be produced by the elevation of the
average temperature of a column of Polar water to the average temperature of a
column of Equatorial water of the same height, and then calcidates on this basis
the gradient which the surface of the sea would possess along the quadrant. This
gradient being far smaller than that which experiment has shown to be necessary
to produce a sensible fiow of water over a solid surface, it is assumed by Mr. CroU
that this difference of level wiU be constantly maintained, and that the weights of
the two columns will remain equal ; so that there -sviU be no such disturbance of
equilibrium by the constantly renewed action of Polar Cold; as the Author has

maintained.

   But it appears to him that Mr. CroU, (1) in assuming that such a difference of
level TviU constantly persist, disregards that fundamental principle of Physics which

teaches that fluids "will always tend to uniformity of level; and that (2) in relying
upon experiments which relate to the movement of Water over solid surfaces, he
commits the grave error of ignoring the fact that, as shown in the semidiurnal
passage of the Tide-wave, sensible movements of water upon loater are producible
by a force that bears a far smaller proportion to that of Gravity than that which is

assumed by him to be requisite. On the other hand, Mr. CroU does not attempt
to show how the almost Polar coldness of the Deep-Sea bottom, even under the

Equator, can be constantly maintained, except by a continual flow of Polar water

from the Polar to the Equatorial area ; nor does he show how it happens that a

disturbance of Thermal Equilibrium which must be constantly undergoing renewal
can be without its efiect in producing such a contmual movement of Ocean- Water
as takes place in all collections of fluid that are unequally heated. The primum
mobile of the Circulation advocated by the Author is Cold, which, when applied to

--the sitrface, seems to him precisely the equivalent of Heat applied to the bottom,

as in the ordinary apparatus for warming buildings by hot water.
    If Cold were continuous! j' applied to a portion of the surface of any collection

of Water, however large, and the liquid were not warmed again elsewhere, either
by conduction or radiation, the effect of such Cold would be to produce movements in
the liquid, by which the wJiole of it would be at last reduced to a low uniform tempe-
rature when all movement would cease. But if, while Cold is continuously applied

                                           ;

at one part, Heat is continuously applied at another, it is submitted that a Vertical
Circulation must be produced, which wiU be kept up as long as these antagonistic

conditions are maintained.

   The Author, not claiming more for himself than the abilitv to apply the Elemen-

tary^ principles of Physics uuder the guidance of Educated Common Sense, submits

the foregoing to the consideration of the distinguished Mathematicians and Physi-

Acists of Section ; who are much better judges than he can be of the soundness of

his views, and of the validity of the objections raised by Mr. CroU.

   Oil Recent Estimates of Solar Temperature. By James Dewae, F.R.S.E.

   After referring to the recent discussion on the temperature of the sun, in which
Secchi, ZoUner, Vicare, Deville, and Ericsson have taken part, the author proceeds
to group all the known methods of arriving at a knowledge of high temperatures
imder eight different processes. The following Table gives the names of the phy-

sicists who have specially employed each process, together with the principle on
which it is founded :-- "^

    After treating of the great disparity of opinion regarding the temperatui'c of the

sun, the author proceeds to detail how it is possible, from the known luminous
intensity of the sim, to derive a new estimate of solar temperature. This calculation

is based on a definite law relating to temperature aud luminosity in the case of solids,
viz. the total luminous intensity is a parabolic function of the temperature above

that temperature where all kinds of luminous rays occur ; Tso that if is a certain

initial temperature, and I its luminous intensity, a a certain increment of temperature,

then we have the following relation :

                                                      T+M(a)=?*2l.

   The temperature T is so high as to include aU kinds of luminous rays, viz. DiX)' C,

and the increment a is 46° C. This formula expresses well the results of Draper,
and his numbers are used as a first approximation. It results from the above

equation that, at a temperature of 2400° C, the total luminous intensity will be 900

times that which it was at 1037° C. Now the temperature of the oxyhydrogen

fiame does not exceed 2400° C, and we know from Fizeau and Foucault's experiments
that sunlight has 150 times the luminous intensity of the lime-light ; so that we
only require to calculate at what temperature this intensity is reached in order to
get the solar temperature. This temperature is 16000° C, in round numbers.

Enormously high temperatures are not required, therefore, to produce great luminous
intensities, and the temperature of the sun need not, at least, exceed the above

number. Sir William Thomson, in his celebrated article, " On the Age of the Sun's
Heat," says, " It is almost certain that the sun's mean temperature is even now as

high as 14000° C. ; " and this is the estimate with which the luminous intensity

calculation agrees well.

   On the Temperature of the Electric SjoarJc. By James Dewak, F.R.S.E.

   The author begins this paper by calculating the highest hypothetical tempera-
ture that could be produced by the chemical combination of the most energetic
elements if all the heat evolved could be thrown into the product. This would
not exceed 19.j00° C. in the case of silica, and 15000° C. in the oxides of alu-
minium and magnesium ; aud these .are the highest results. The estimation of the

temperature of the electric spark is based on the thermal value of each spark,

together with the volume of the same. The methods of observing these quantities
are fully detailed in the memoir. The general result -may be stated thus, the tem-
perature of the electric spark used in the experiments ranged between 10000° C.
and 15000° C.

On the Stresses produced in an Elastic Solid hij Inequalities of Temperature.

By S. HoPKiNSON, B.Sc.                                                         *

   Since the equations of equilibrium aud the equations connecting strains and
stresses in an elastic solid are both line,ar, the principle of superposition holds ; and

we may consider the effect of each cause tending to produce stress as if none other

existed, and finally add the result of the separate causes to obtain the effect of all

acting together.

   It is foimd that the effect of imequal heating is to subtract from the components of

lateral force X, Y, Z, at any point, terms y-Tjy -I,y -I,                      where  y is  a  constant
                                                                   QtX dy M(5

and r is tlie temperature, and consequently that in the case of ec^uilibiium of tem-

=perature, /. c. where v^r 0, the known results,

where 6 is the dilation at any point, p the density, and n the displacement parallel

to the axis of a; are still true ; in fact r appears as part of the potential of external

forces.

    In the case of a spherical shell, the interior of which is maintained at one con-
stant temperature and the exterior at another, it is found that the stresses are
independent of the thickness of the envelope, and that the g-reater liability of thick
vessels to break where the temperature is maintained different in the two surfaces
is due to the fact that the thickness of the vessel makes it possible to maintain a
greater difference between the surfaces, whilst the general temperatures of the
media within and without remain the same as for the thin vessel. In fact the
greater safety of a thin vessel lies in its greater conducting-power, and not in the
mechanical properties of its form.

   The principle of superposition may be applied by integration to the case of the

 solidification of a fluid sphere in shells beginning at the outside, the effect of the
solidification of each infinitely thin shell being calculated, and the strains produced

by each added together as an integral.

 On the Use of Electromagnetic instead of Electrostatic Induction in Cable-

    Si(/naUinff. By G. K. "Winter, F.R.A.S., Tehyraiih Enyineer, Madras

     Railway.
    The experiments on this subject were made by the author in ignorance of the
 contents of Mr. Varley's specification of 1802. The sending-apparatus being the

 same as that now in use, the currents from the cable were made to pass through a

 long, fine, primary wire of an induction-coil, and the induced currents in the
  secondary wire were used for worldng the receiving-instrument. In long sub-
 marine cables the receiving- instrument was a Thomson's galvanometer ; but the

 siphon recorder might also be used. The signals obtained in this way were

 steadier, and the elements of the letters more distinctly formed than with the

 condenser or electrostatic method. On short submarine cables and land-lines,

  on which Morse's instruments are used, this method, though requiring more battery-
 power than that now in use, and necessitating the use of a polarized relay, would
  almost entirely ])revent the delays caused by earth-currents during magnetic storms
  and on long cables this method, while, equally with the condenser method, render-
  ing earth-currents harmless as far as signalling is concerned, would, besides, cause
 the cable to be only dynamically instead of statically charged by them, and the
 danger of damage to the insulator to be at least halved thereby.

     Since the paper was read, the author has been informed by Mr. C. F. Varley
 that the induction-coil was tried by him as early as 1861, on the Dunwich and Zan-
 voort cable. In 1802 he tried it on the Dunwich and Zanvoort and the Lowestoft
  and Zanvoort cables, in one circuit of about 1000 nauts ; also in 1865 upon the
  Atlantic cable, on board the ' Great Eastern,' besides manj' times on his artificial

  cable.

                                          Meteoeologt.

                 On Oreeic Meteorohgi/, By the Rev. H. A. Boys.

    Athens, tlie only place in Greece where, to tlie best of the author's knowledge, a
meteorolog'ical register is regularly kept, is by no means a representative station,being
more bracing- and dry, hotter in summer, colder in winter than any other place at
the same elevation in the kingdom. Patras, where the author, under considerable diffi-
culties, lias with tolerable regularity for nearly two years conducted observations of
temperature, rainfall, barometer, hygrometer, wind, clouds, and earthquakes, lies on
the shore of a gulf open to the west, and more or less shut in by mountains on the
remaining sides. Its climate is mild, soft, and relaxing, cooler in summer, hotter
in winter than Athens. Standing just to one side of the draught through the nar-

row entrance of the Gulf of Corinth, it has little variety in the direction of the

winds, which nearly alwaj's turn the weathercocks E. or W.

   But of those winds whose direction is more or less E., there are three distinct
kinds: First, a real N.E., which blows in early spring and in summer for ten or even
fifteen days together, dropping at night, wliich brings brilliantly clear, dry, cold
weather in February and March, and brilliantly clear, dr}', hot weather in the sum-
mer time ; it covers the pools with a film of ice in winter, and makes even well-
seasoned wood warp and crack in summer. Second, an apparently E. wind, which
originally proceeds from Africa, and blows occasionally from October to June in
gales which continue 70 or 80 hours ; it is charged with impalpable sand, hiding
the Sim behind a grey haze, is very violent and hot, and painfully dry, bringing
temperature up to 77° even in March. Third, a local wind oft' a moimtainnear the
town, which sweeps down, at night usually, in brief and furious squalls.

   The Sirocco, a warm, damp, S. or S. W. wind, brings heavy autumn and winter rains.

   The W. wind, which divides with that first mentioned the greater part of the year,
is not remarkable in any way, but brings beautiful weather at almost any time.

   The Mistrale, a fresh N.W. wind, blows in the summer time after rain in the
Adriatic, bringing coolness and moisture when most needed.

  --Rainfall. That in Patras differs very much from that in Athens, Patras having

by a great deal the larger quantity ; and the times at which the rain falls in the
two places have no more than a very general agreement. It is best to consider the
year's rain from July to June, and so to avoid cutting the rainy season in two, as
would be done by dividing the year between December and January.

   It is hazardous to attempt general rules from only two years' experience j but the
author believes the following will usually hold good :

   July. No rain.

  AAugust. few light showers perhaps a heavy one.
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

   September. At least one heavy thunder-storm.

   For the next four months frequent thunder-storms with heavy rain.

  A spell of fine weather in Feljruary and March, followed by unsettled weather, with

light rains, until the end of April, after which continuous tine weather may be ex-

pected, relieved rather than interrupted by a few short though perhaps heavy showers.
   In tlie wettest months a long-continued drizzly rain is a rare occurrence ; it comes

generally in short hea-s-y showers, between wliich the sun shines brightly, and the

--roads, where good, dry up directly.

   Ico is rarely seen iu Patras, aud suow very solclom. Geraniums continue to
flower all the winter. But all the winter there is an horizon of snow-capped
mountain to the E. half of the compass, which suow is not entirely gone iu the
middle of July. The heat is great in July and August : last summer there were

twenty days running when the maximum was never less than 00° nor the miuimum

than 70°. For further particulars see Tables.

On the Advantages of Iceeping Records of Physical Phenomena connected with

                      Thunder-storms. By W. de Fonvielle,

   The author begins by referring to the importance of the records of luminous meteors

made by the Association, and which have given rise to a great science, the future

influence of which on astronomy it is impossible to determine. After having
reviewed the work of the Committee for Luminous Meteors, he shows that thunder-
storm phenomena are practically far more interesting for us, as being_ more inti-
mately connected with our personal welfare and security. Only in few disconnected

cases do falliu» stars produce fatal results, while thunder-storms may have an

important influence on our property, our health, and our lives. Captive balloons
are spoken of by Arago as tending to enlarge the system of protection inaugurated

by Dr. Franklin, so that an immense field may be said to be opened for inventions

in this direction.

   The author showed, by quoting his correspondence, that in this very land the
efUciency of lightning-conductors had been questioned, and that in Manchester a
conference, held on the occasion of Kersall Church being struck, had arrived at the
conclusion that lightning-conductors were worse than useless.

   The author referred to the use of the electric telegraph for giving warning to

shipping, as practised by the Board of Trade. He alluded also to the steps taken

hy the French Government for having ma]is drawn of the course followed by
thunder-storms. The author showed that, if the question is limited to the observa-
tion of phenomena when places are struck by lightning, it is of great importance
and magnitude. Quoting several newspapers, the author finds that not less than
five or six cases of great scientific interest had occurred within a month in the
county of Sussex, all of these being- lost for science and forgotten for ever, if not

{roperly recorded. He is advocating no novelty, as a Committee of the French

  nstitute had officially advised the French Government in 1823 to establish a
record of these cases, where a building had been struck by lightning when supplied

with a lightning-conductor. He explained how prevalent superstitious had pre.

vented the French GoTemment for a long while from giving force to the advice
gi'\en hj the French academicians. AVhen these obstacles were partially removed
the opportunity was lost for establishing it, and the suggestion quite forgotten.
He thinks that the French Government of 1872 wiU take a more intelligent view
of the question, especially if the British Association encourages them in doing so,

by establishing some definite organization for the purpose, as he is himself a
living proof of the interest felt now by the French Government in these matters,
having been sent to England in order to report on the late thunder-storms which
had been so remarkable. Would it not be in some respects unbecoming of a great
nation like England, whose power has been unchecked, to take no interest in
these casvialties which are attracting the notice of a foreign people emerging from

so many calamities ?

  On a Periodicity in the Frequency of Cyclones in tJie Indian Ocean south of

         the Equator. By Cblieles Meldeum (Mauritius Observatory).

"^One of the objects for which the Meteorological Society of Mauritius was esta-
blished in 1851, was to obtain extracts from the Meteorological llegisters of vessels
visiting the harbour of Port Louis, especially of such vessels as had experienced
bad weather in the Indian Ocean.

    Accordingly clerks were employed to copy all the log-books that could be

procm-ed.

   In 1853 the system of registration was remodelled. Instead of having the obser-

vations contained in each log-book recorded separatelj', all the observations in all
the log-books for the same day were entered on the same page.

   As this system has been conducted without interruption to the present time, the
Society has now a large collection of observations showing more or less the state
of the winds and weather over the frequented parts of the Indian Ocean, in the
form of a daily journal, during the last nineteen years; so that a person may find
at once what weather prevailed on any day, or in any year, during that period.

   Together with the years 1851-52, therefore, during which the registers were

differently kept, we have twentv-one years' continuous obsei-vation from the meridian

of Greenwich to 120° E., and from 23° N. to 45° S.
   Adding to the information obtained by the Society throughout these twenty-

one years, numerous observations collected by several persons for the previous four
years (1847-50), we have a more or less complete record of all, or ver}^ nearlj-^
"all, the cyclones which have taken place in the Southern Indian Ocean during
the last twenty-five years; for Mauritius is so much in the track of these cyclones,
and so much frequented by vessels in distress, and by others trading between the
Colonv and England, India, and Australia, that it is scarcely possible for any -Niolent
hurricane to happen without being noticed.

    Taking now, for the present, the area comprised between the equator and the
parallel of 25° S., and the meridians of 40° and 110° E., and examining a Table of
the cyclones that have occurred there from 1847 to 1872, it is fomul that some
years "have been remarkable for a frequency, and others for a comparative absence

of cyclones.

   The five years 1847-51 were characterized by cyclone-frequency. Then came
a period of comparative calm (1852-57), which was followed by six years (1858-
63) remarkable for cyclones. The next five years (1864-68) showed a con.sider-
able decrease ; and since 18G9 there has been an increase, until, for the present year
(1872), the number of cyclones is already (28th June) greater than in any year

since 1861.

   What has now been said is not only borne out by the records of the Meteorological

Society, which give detailed accounts of the hurricanes, but also, I have little
doubt, by the books of the Docks and Marine Establishments. Especially in 1847
and 1848, and again in 1860-63, the harbour of Port Louis was at times crowded
with disabled ships ; whereas in the j'ears 1855-57 and 1866-68 there were very few.

   It will be seen that these years correspond pretty closely with the maxima and
minima epochs of sun-spots.

        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                   57

    For the present, I wish merely to call atteution to the subject, in order that the
connexion which I think exists between sun-spot-frequency and cvclone-frequency

may be either verified or refuted by past or future observation, "it appears to me
that there is more tlian a mere coincidence as to time. There are three maxima

and two minima epochs of cyclone-frequency corresponding nearly, if not entirely,
with similar sun-spot epochs.

   To examine the matter fully, it would be necessary not only to know the number

of cyclones in each year, but also the extent and duration of each, and tlie force of

the wnid. If we could thus get an expression for the annual amount of cyclonic
energy, and could show that it varied directly as the amount of sun-spots, a con-
nexion would be established. One violent hurricane, which lasted ten days and

passed over thousands of miles, might have more value than half a dozen smaller
and short-lived ones. However, having traced a large number of the cyclones in
question, I have no doubt that the years of greatest cyclone-frequency were o-ene-

rally, if not always, the years of greatest cyclone-energy ; and that the number of

cyclones in a year is a fair expression of the cyclonic activity for tliat year.

   Now, taking the maxima and minima epochs of the sun-spot period and one year

--on each side of them, and comparing the number of cyclones in these three-year

periods, we get the following results :

58 REPORT 1872.

   Assumiug that we have got a close approximation to the actual number of

cj'clones, and that the numbers fairly represent cj'clonic energy, it is difficult to
avoid the conclusion that the above Tables point to a definite law, and that Mete-
orology, Magnetism, and Solar Physics are closely connected ; for v\'hat holds good
with regard to a large tract of the Indian Ocean, probably holds good with regard

to other portions of the earth's surface.
    Is it not probable, also, that if there is such a connexion as is here suggested

between sun-spots or sun-cyclones (as they have sometimes been called) and earth-
cyclones, there is a similar connexion between the sun-spots and cyclones in the

other planets ?

The Rainfall of Sussex. By Frederick Ernest Sawyer, of Brighton.

   The county of Sussex is divided by the South Downs into two meteorological

--districts the coast district, which has a small rainfall and an equable climate, and

the Weald, which has a much greater rainfall and an extreme climate.

The causes of the increased rainfall in the Weald of Sussex are threefold : first,

the Downs, which attract and condense the vapour in the rain-clouds which pass

over them, causing it to fall in the Weald as rain ; secondly, the forests, which

bjeak the wind and assist in condensing vapour, the cutting-down of the Wealden

forests for fuel, when iron was manufactured in the county, having, however, dimi-

nished the rainfall in some  parts                           and, thirdly, the  rivers, the  beds of which form
                                                          ;

a path, up which rain-storms, and particularly thunder-storms, pass from the coast

into the Weald, and also by condensation produce " tidal showers."

The average coast rainfall is about 25 to 26 inclies, whilst that of the Weald is

nearly 33 inches. The greatest rainfall in the county is at Lynch, near Midhurst,

the arerage there being about 38 or 39 inches. The least rainfall is at Pevensey,

where the mean of thirtj' years was 24-07 inches.

The comparison of the totals of rainfall on both sides of the Downs shows an

increase in the totals in the Weald of from 20 to oO per cent., owing to their influ-

ence. At Worthing, on the coast, the mean of three years ending 1871 was

23-88 inches ; and at Steyning, in the Weald, it was 34-25 inches, or very nearly

50 per cent. more.

The gi-eatest rainfall recorded in the county is 54-20 inches in 1852 at West

Dean, tlie least at Pevensey in 1858, 13-11 inches. There does not appear to be

much difference in the seasonal distribution of rain in -various parts of the county.

The low districts round Pulboro', Arundel, Bramber, Ilenfield, and Lewes become

inundated after heavj' rains. Such inundations occurred in 1810, 1821, 1828, 1839,

and 1847. Severe droughts occurred in 1834, 1847, and 1852.

There is only one rainfall proverb peculiar to the county :

                    "When Wolsonbury has a cap,

                      Hurstpierpoint will have a drap."

   Wolsonbury Hill is a summit in the Downs, near Clayton ; and when enveloped
in clouds, rain may be expected at Hm-stpierpoint.

       On the Mensurator, a new Instrument for the Solution of Triangles.
                                By W. Maesham Adams.

   The Mensurator is an instrument by which triangles may be solved ; that is to
say, when the necessary data are given, the instrument maybe set according to

them, and the values of the other parts read off.
   The author illustrated the use of the instrument by numerous examples.

                                                  On a neiv Hygrometer. By George Dines,

The peculiarity of this instrument is, that the use of ether is altogether dispensed

with, water only of a lower temperature than the dew-point beiug required : this

is placed iu a small reservoir., By turning a tap, the water is allowed to pass through

a closed vessel covered with thin polished metal or black glass. As soon as the

dew appears \ipon the surface of the metal or glass, the ilow of the water must be

stopped ; and a thermometer, the bulb of which is enclosed in the vessel, shows the

temperature of the dew-point.

   Using this instrument side by side with the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers,

the author of the paper lias come to the conclusion that (whatever Tables may be

used) the latter can never be depended upon as giving more than an approximation

to the dew-point. He also describes the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere as badly

mixed                                  and  that  masses of  air very  differently charged with                                                                            moisture are rolling
                                    ;

over the surface of the earth in the same manner as the clouds above^ the difference

being that they are invisible.

               On a Nautical Photometer. By J. Hopkinsoit, D.Sc.

   The photometers hitherto used for viewing distant lights, too faint for comparison
with a standard caudle, depend on the absorption of light by a coloured medium

--till the light is no longer visible. These photometers are defective : 1st, as they

do not give the true factor by which the light is diminished in intensity : 2nd, the
absorbing medium is arbitrary, and must be arbitrarily defined ; 3rd, the eflects on
red and white lights are not comparable.

   The photometer suggested consists of two suitably mounted Nicol's prisms,
which can be turned about a common axis till the light is eclipsed. If x be the
angle between the polarizing planes of the prisms, the light must be diminished

   -- m^ times to render it invisible, where is a constant near unity depending on

the reflection at the faces of the prisms.

Nouveau Thermom^tre destine a prendre les Temperatures de la Surface des

J'ai rhonnem- de presenter au meeting un thermometre d'un nouveau modele,

destine a prendre la temperature de la surface de la mor ou des fleuves.

La disposition nouvelle de cet instrument consiste en ce que le reservoir est

se reunissent, entourent le reservoir et couservent par capillarite una quantity assez

considerable du liqiiide dont on voulait obtenir la temperature. La presence de
ce liquide autour du reservoir permet de faire tout a son aise la lecture de I'ecbelle,
car je me suis assure par des experiences multipliees que I'evaporation a la surface
du pinceau, meme en presence du soleil et dans un air tres-sec, est impuissante a

faire varier la temperature du riSservoir avant un temps triple ou quadruple de

celui qui est n^cessaire a la lecture.

   Voici una expi^rience qui montre avec quelle lenteur le nouveau thermometre
perd la temperature du bain dans lequel on I'a plonge.

   La tempt^rature de I'eau etait de 19° centigrade.

  Au soleil un thermometre ordinaire marquait 37°.

   Le thermometre a pinceau fut plong(5 dans I'eau, marqua bientot 19^, fut retir<l

et expose au soleil. Or, apres

 30 secondes il marquait 19-0  180 secondes il marquait 19-15

   Le temps n^cessaire pour retirer le thermometre de I'eau et en faire la lecture
n'est jamais superieur a 15 secondes. Dahs I'experience rapportee la thermometre

On the Temperature-correction of an Aneroid. Bij John Phillips, M.A. and
 Hon. D.C.L. Oxon., F.E.S., Professor of GeoJogy in the University of Oxford,

  Few instruments invented in modern days have found a more ready and general

acceptance for ordinary observations of atmospheric pressure than the Aneroid
but for accurate weighing of the column of air it is not to be trusted without care-
ful precautions, and a preliminary study of the particular instrument emploj^ed.
The object of this communication is to explain a method by which an instrument
which has been in frequent use for nine years, and is liable to enormous variation
of reading by change of temperature, has been made to give accurate results.

   The instrument has a diameter of 1-9 incli, and weighs 1560 grains. It is quick
and firm in its indications while kept in the same position and at the same tem-
perature : but the reading is reduced if the position be changed from horizontal to
vertical, and by any, however small, elevation of temperature. It has suffered
many shocks, but is entirely uninjured by these and other misfortunes. Though

divided only to ^V i^ich, its indications can be recorded with entire confidence to

24o ) and are, in fact, by a peculiar method of reading, written down by estimation to

x-ias- Its scale is correct for a range of 24 to 31 inches.

   Held in the warm hand, or exposed to sunshine, the index turns sensibly to the

left. Heated from 40° to 80°, the deviation exceeds three tenths of the baro-

metric inch. By employing a hot closet the effect is augmented enormously, so

that for one degree at 100° Fahr. the index retreats about -020 inch.
   After numerous and often-repeated comparisons with a standard barometer, at

different atmospheric pressures and temperatures, the following summary of ob-
served differences or corrections (e) to be applied to this aneroid, so as to make its
indications agree with the mercurial instrument, as read at the same time, was
adopted as a basis for calculation. The corrections are additive.

ball from the axis, and fastening the spiral wire to it, the top is prepared for another

experiment.
   In the former experiment a circle is described if the velocit}' does not change

but the friction and resistance of the air tend to diminish it ; and so with a decreasing
velocity of rotation the angle of inclination of the top's axis becomes changeable,
and instead of a circle, a spiral line is described, with ellipses evolving on it, as is
shown by pressing the paper against the axis for a longer time, the paper being
covered with a thin laver of soot.

   The author tried to "bring a top without the brass arm and ball in contact with a
spiral line, constructed by a wire bent into a spiral line. The top then began rapidly
to move along the spiral line, and, reaching its end, began to follow again the direc-
tion of the spiral wire on its inner side, and so on.

   This spiral and periodical motion is similar to that of a pendulum on a pre-
scribed or given trace ; it is very like that of a cycloidal pendulum, where the
motion must be performed on a cycloid.

   The disturbing force produces a pressure on the wire, and forces the axis of the

top to follow the direction of the spiral curve.

   The spiral may be replaced by a curve of any other description.

Having been examined himself by the Commission, and having been in communi-

--that the following fundamental points are receiving great attention, viz. : (1) that

the objects of scientific teaching and of scientific investigation are distinct, and

all State Scientific Institutions and action of every kind should be subject to the

direction of a single Minister of State ; and (4) that such Minister of State should

have the assistance of a permanent paid Consultative Council, composed of eminent

men of science. Of these measures he regards the two last (a Minister and

Council) as by far the most important.

The paper next proceeds to consider how the Association may further advance

the great question of State Scientific Organization. The -RTiter considers that one
of the greatest obstacles in the way consists in the imperfect conception which

statesmen have formed of the duties of the State with respect to science ; and he

believes that this is in a great measure due to indiscriminateness in private action

and the distribution of private funds. Many great scientific problems have been

taken up with the help of such means, only to be laid aside because those means

have proved insufficient. The result is a confusion of thought as to what scientific

objects should be carried out by the State, and what maj' properly devolve on

private bodies and individuals.

In order to assist in clearing up this confusion, the author proposes that the

--Association should classify all applications for aid coming before them under two

great heads Public and Private ; that they should grant pecuniary aid to the

latter only ; that they should furnish the Government annually with a list of objects

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          6*

whicli they regard as Public, with suoh advice as to the best mode of attaining

them as maj^ seem necessary ; and that before eacli annual meeting they should
ascertain from the Government what progress has been made towards the attain-

ment of those objects, publishing the result in their Proceedings.

   The author disclaims any wish to bring the Association into collision with the

Government. He does not believe the above measures woidd have that eit'ect ; and

lie sees no other mode of bringing forcibly before the Government, in a practical
form, those great wants of science which State resources alone can suppl)'.

   lie next proposes the following tests by which to distinguish Public Science for

--the purpose of classification: (1) Continuity; (2) Probability of Expansion;

(3) Unremunerativeness to the individual cultivating it, combined with profit or

advantage to the community generally'; (4) Costliness. Is'o body is better able

to supply such tests with discretion than the British Association.

The author then enumerates some typical examples of private aid injudiciously

Kewgiven to stricth" public objects; viz. the       Observatory, KainfaU, Sewage, the

Map of the Moon, and the Tides.

   After pointing out the effect in each of these cases, he then urges that the action

now proposed will not chill individual enterprise, which is too fixed a sentiment in
the English character to be capable of eradication. He is convinced that ample

use will be found for the limited income of the Association after eliminating purely

public objects. He admits that such objects will perhaps at first be more or less

neglected if abandoned by the Association ; but he considers that this inconvenience

will be cheaiply purchased by the dissemination of sounder views on State Science,

to which it cannot fail to lead.

Address h>j J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S., President of the Section.

One of my fellow-students in the laboratory of the late Professor Graham began

the study of Chemistry because he wanted to be a geologist, and he had read ia

some Geological Catechism that, in order to be versed in that science, it was neces-

sary, as a preliminary step, to gain a knowledge of Chemittry, Mineralogy, Zoo-

logy, Botany, and I know not what besides. My friend became a chemist, and

found that enough for the exercise of his faculties. Yet the catechism had truth

on its side                                         for so intertwined are the various branches of                                                                                                                                 observational or experi-

an acquaintance with the whole cycle of knowledge.

Yet, on the other hand, wlio can survey the wliole field e^en of modern Che-

mistry ? There was a time doubtless, in the recollection of the more venera,ble of

my auditors, wlien it was not impossible to learn all tliat chemists had to teach
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but now that our " Handbook " has grown so large that it Avould take a Briareus

to carry it, and it requires a small army of abstractors to give the Chemical Society

the substance of what is done abroad, we are compelled to become specialists iii
spite of ourselves. He who studies the general laws of Chemistry may well turn

in despair from the ever-growing myriads of transformations among the compounds

and others find their whole soul engrossed by the phenyl compounds.

How is this necessity of specialization to be reconciled witli the necessity of

general knowledge ? By our forming a home for ourselves in some particular region,

and becoming intimately conversant with every feature of the locality and their

choicest associations, while at the same time we learn the general map of the

country, so as to know the relative position and importance of our favourite resort,

and to be able (when we desire it) to make excursions elsewhere.

To facilitate this is one of the great objects of the British Association. The

the Annual Report, comprises several provinces. Mathematics, Astronomy, Optics,

Heat, Electricitv, and Meteorology.

   Mathematics and Astronomy.--It was when the idea of exact weights and mea-
sures was projected into it that Alchemy was transmuted into Chemistry. As our
science has become more refined in its methods its numerical laws have become
more and more significant ; and it may safely be predicted that the more closely it

is allied with general physics, the greater will be the mathematical knowledge
demanded of its votary. 'But till lately the Chemist and the Astronomer seemed

far asunder as the heavens and the earth, and none could have foretold t;hat we
should now be analyzing the atmospheres of the sun and stars, or throwing light on

the chemical composition of planetary nebulns and the heads of comets. There is

in this, too, as in other things, a reciprocal benefit ; for we are encouraged to hope

that this celestial chemistry will reveal to us elements which have not yet been

detected among the constituents of our globe.                                                             ,          · ··                                  .1

cheniical force, or rather how easily are these Protean forces transformed into one

another ! The rays of the sun com'ing upon our earth are like a chemist entering

his laboratory : they start strange decompositions and combinations not only in the

veo-etable kingdom, but also among inorganic gases and salts; they are absorbed
selectively by different bodies which they penetrate, or are refracted, dispersed, and

polarized according to the chemical composition and structure of the substance.
All this has been the subject recently of much scientific research; and I need

scarcely remind you of the beautiful art of photography as one of the results of

photo-chemistry, or of the benefits that have arisen from a study of circular polar-

ization, indices of refraction, and especially spectrum-analysis. In regard to the
latter, however, I would remark that while the optical examination of the rays
emitted by luminous vapours has yielded most brilliant results, there is another

kind of spectrum-analysis-that of the rays absorbed by various terrestrial gases,

liquids, and solids--which has already borne valuable fruit, and which, as it is tar
more extensively applicable than the other, may perhaps play a still more impor-
tant part in the 'Chemistry of the future. The dispersion of the rays of the spec-
trum is certainly due to the chemical nature of the body through which they pass;
but this is as yet almost unbroken ground waiting for an explorer. As to heat, it
has ever been 'the tool of the chemist; and it would be difficult to overestimate
the significance of researches into the specific heat or the melting- and boiling-
points of elements and their compounds. The laws of chemical combination have
been elucidated lately by thermo-chemical researches ; it has been sought to esta-
blish a connexion be'tween the absorprion or radiation of heat and the complexity

  DWhen -we pass from C to (that is, from the crust of the globe to the organized

beings that inhabit and adorn it) we are introduced into new regions of research.

When organic chemistry was young, Cuvier said of it, " Dans cette nouvelle magie,

le chimiste n'a presque qu'a vouloir : tout pent se changer en tout : tout pent s'ex-

traire de tout ;'' and though we have now learnt much of the laws by which these

magical transformations proceed, they far transcend the dreams of the French phi-

losopher ; there is yet no visible limit to the multitude of products to be derived
from the vegetable and animal world, and their changes seem to afford boundless

scope for chemical ingenuity. The benefit here also is reciprocal; for the physio-

logist enters by our aid into the wonderfid laboratory of the living plant or animal,

and learns to estimate the mode of action of different foods and medicines. There

have lately been some good researches of this character. The diiiiculties are great

but the results to be achieved are worthy of any effort.

  EThere may be little intercourse between us and the geographers in ; but we

stand in no distant relationship with many of the subjects discussed in F. Eco-

nomic science embraces the chemical arts, from cookery upwards ; such impeiial

questions as that of the national standards, or the patent laws, interest us greatly

the yield of our corn-fields is increased through our knowledge of the constituents

of soils and manures ; and upon many of the chemical manufactures depend in no

small degree the commerce and the wealth of Britain.
   In this most important branch of technical chemistry we need the skill of the

mechanician                                                    and  this  introduces  us  to  Section G.  One of the questions of the
                                                            ;

day will illustrate the connexion between these varied departments of study. Sta-

tistics prove that the consumption of coal is now advancing, not at the gradual pace

which recent calculations allowed, but at a rapidly accelerating speed ; and they

make the householder anxious about rising prices, and the political economist about

the duration of our coal-fields. It is well known that there is a great waste of fuel
throughout the country, as the maximum of heat produced by tlie combustion is

very far from being ever utilized ; and it will be for the combined wisdom of the

chemist, physicist, and mechanician to devise means for reducing this lavish ex-

penditure, or to indicate other available sources of power.

While this coiTelation of the natural sciences renders it desirable that the votary

of one should have some general acquaintance with the rest, the correlation of all

knowledge shows that no education can be complete which ignores the study of

Anature.  mind fed only on one particular kind of lore, however excellent that

kind may be, must fail of proper nourishment. I am not going to say a word against

philological studies : I am too fond of them myself for that ; and I could wish that

the modern languages were taught more, and the classic languages were taught

better, than they are at present. What I do contend for is, that chemistry (or some

cognate branch of science) should have an honoured place in the education of every

English lady and gentleman. I say puijosely " an honoured place ;" for at present

where chemistry is introduced we too often find the idea latent which was expressed

by one principal of a lady's college, who told a friend of mine that he was to give the

girls a course of pretty experiments, but that she did not expect him to teach them any
thing ; and we know that when boys repeat chemical experiments at home it is

looked upon as an amusement, a philosophical one no doubt, but rather objection-

able, inasmuch as they spoil their mother's towels and singe their own eyebrows.

Of course some knowledge of chemistiy is indispensable for a large number of our

manufacturers, and for the medical profession, while it is extremely valuable to the

farmer, the miner, and the engineer. It will also be readily granted that informa-

tion about the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we live upon, the fuel
we burn, and the various common objects we handle, must be of service to every

man. But we are met by the advocates of the old system of education with the

remark that the value of school-teaching does not depend so much upon the infor-

--mation given as upon the mental training. This I admit though it seems to me

that if the same training can be secured by two studies, the one of which (like

the making of Latin verses) gives no information at all, and the other (like chemical

analysis) imparts some useful knowledge, we should prefer the latter. But I hold

that, as a means of educating the mental faculties, chemistry, faithfully taught, has

in many respects the advantage oyer literary studies. There is superahundaut scope

for the exercise of the memory ; the powers of observation are developed by it to a

wonderful degi'ee; the reasoning powers may be well disciplined on the philosophy of

chemical change, or the application of the laws of Dalton, Mitscherlich, and Avo-

gadro ; while the imagination may be cultivated by the attempt to form a conception

of the ultimate particles of matter, with their affinities and atomicities, as they act

and react upon one another under the control of the physical forces. And I might

speak of higher considerations than mere intellectual culture ; for surely the works

of the Allwise and Bountiful Creator are a more truthful and a purer subject of con-

templation for the opening minds of youth, and more in accordance with Christian

ideas, than are the crude notions of a past stage of civilization, and the ignorant

and gross fancies of a defunct paganism.

 --There is another requirement in education the training of the mind to the dis-

covery and recognition of truth. For this purpose philological studies have no fit-

ness ; mathematical studies, though peculiarly adapted for it, apply only to cases
where demonstrative proof is possible ; but the study of physical science is remark-

ably well fitted for teaching the proper methods of inquiry, and the strict relations

Nowbetween theory and fact.  the historian, the politician, the mental philosophei',

the theologian, or any one else who desires to influence the thoughts of his fellow

men, should be in a position to distinguish between truth and error in his own de-

partment ; and his mind may be well disciplined for this by a study which is less
liable to be disturbed by human passions, predilections, or wishes, and where the

conclusions are more readily brought to the test of observation or experiment.

Our Government insists on a certain standard of education for all who are allowed

to teach in our elementary schools. In those schools which receive no State aid it

is only public opinion which can insist that the teacher shall be duly qualified him-

self. Such bodies as the British Association form this public opinion, and will de-

serve well of their country if they demand that these masters and mistresses shall

know something of the material universe in which they move, and be able to im-

part to every child such scientific knowledge as shall afford him an interesting sub-

ject for thought, give him useful information, and discipline his mental powers.

   Among the many sei"vices rendered by the monthly reports of the progress of

chemistry which the Chemical Society publishes, and the British Association helps
to pay for, there is one which is rather salutary than pleasant. They bring pao-
minently before our notice the fact that in the race of original research we are
being distanced by foreign chemists. 1 refer not to the quality of our work, about
which opinions will probably differ, but to the quantity, which can be determined
by very simple arithmetic. This is a matter of no small importance, not only for
the honour of England, but still more for the advancement of science and the
welfare of man. From the Physical Chair of this Association last year, a note of
warning was uttered in the following words, after a reference to the sad fate of

--Newton's successors who allowed mathematical science almost to die out of the

country : " If the successors of Davy and Faraday pause to ponder even on their
achievements, we shall soon be again in the same state of ignominious inferiority."
The President of the Chemical Society also, in the last Anniversary Address, di-ew

attention to the diminished activity of Chemical discovery, and to the lamentable

fewness of original papers communicated. He traces this chiefly to "the non-

recognition of experimental research by our universities," and suggests that in the
granting of science-degrees every candidate should be required, as in Germany, to

prove his ability for original investigation.

   Concurring in this, I would remark that other causes have also been assigned,
and other suggestions have been made. There is the small recognition of original

--research even by our learned Societies at least such recognition as wiU come home

to the understanding of the general public. It is true the fellowship of the Royal
Society is awarded mainly for original discoveries, and there are two or three

medals to be disposed of annually ; but these distinctions fall to the lot of tne

seniors in science, often men who are beyond the need of encouragement; and
though they doubtless are serviceable as incentives, there is many a beginner in
the honourable contest of discovery who is too modest even to hope for the blue
--68 REPORT 1872.

ribbon of science. While the Victoria Cross is awarded to few, every soldier who
has borne part in a victory expects his clasp ; and so mig-ht every man who has
won victories over the secrets of nature fairly look for some public recognition. It

has been suggested, for instance, that the Royal Society, in addition to the F.R.S.,
mio-ht institute an Associateship, with the letters A.R.S., designed exclusively for

those younger men who have shown zeal and ability in original research, but
whose discoveries have not been sufficient to entitle them already to the Fellowship.

It is suggested, too, that the Chemical Society might give some medal, or diploma,

or some similar distinction to those who contribute papers of sufficient merit.
   But beyond this is the non-recognition of scientific research by society in general.

We can scarcely expect the average enlightened Englishman to be any thing but

scared by a graphic formula, or a doubly sesquipedalian word containing two or
three compound radicals ; but he need not continue to talk of the four elements, or

of acids being neutralized by sugar. But, indeed, the so-caUed educated classes in

England are not only supremely ignorant of science ; they have scarcely yet arrived
at the first stage of improvement--the knowledge of their own ignorance. Then,

again, there is the excessive preference of practical inventions over theoretical dis-

--coveries or rather, perhaps, the inability to appreciate any thing but tangible

results. Thus a new aniline compound is nothing unless it will dye a pretty
colour ; if we speak of the discovery of a;, new metal by the spectroscope, they
simply ask. What is it useful for ? and the rigorous determination of an atomic
weight has for them no meaning, or interest, or beauty. The general appreciation
of science must be of gradual growth j'et there are wealthy men who know its

                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

value, and who might well become the endowers of research. There are, indeed,

--at present funds a^'ailable for the purpose such as the Government Grant, and the

 surplus funds of this Association ; but the money is given simply to cover actual

 outlay; and this, though very useful, scarcely meets the case of those young philo-

 sophers who have no balance at their bankers, and yet must live. Will not some
 of these wealthy men endow experimental scholarships, or professorships, in con-
 nexion with our colleges, institutions, or learned societies ? As an instance of the
 good that may be effected in this way, may be cited the Fullerian professorships;
 and as a very recent example, worthy of all honour, may be mentioned the purpose

 of Mr. J. B. Lawes, not only to continue his elaborate experiments at Rothamsted

 throughout his lifetime, but to place his laboratory and experimental fields in

 tAist, together with £100,000, so that investigations may be continued in the
 wider and more scientific questions which the progress of agTiculture may suggest.

    Tlie Government of our country, through the Science and Art Department, ren-

 ders good assistance to the teaching of science; and if the recommendations of the

 Royal Commission on Scientific Instruction and the Advancement of Science be

 adopted, the introduction of practical examinations for the obtaining of certificates

 for a superior grade of science-master will certainlj^ foster a spirit of research. It

 has been generally held that the promotion of research is within the legitimate

 scope of government ; and where, as in the case of Aristotle and Alexander, genius

 and industry have been sustained by princety munificence, the happiest results
 have ensued. Yet this question of Government aid is a delicate one : for genius,

 when put into swaddhng clothes, is apt to be stifled by them; and were science
 to depend on political favour or imperial support, it would be a fatal calamity.

  Still I think it will be everywhere admitted that science might with propriety be

 subsidized from the public funds in cases where the results may be expected to

  confer a direct benefit upon the community, and where the inquirj', either from its

 expense, its tediousness, its uninteresting character, or the amount of cooperation
 required, is not likely to be carried out by voluntary effort. The astronomical
 work which is paid for by Government bears upon navigation, and answers both
  these requirements ; and it is easy to conceive of inquiries in our owti science that
 might equally deserve the assistance of the State. Some of these might also more
  than repay the outlay, though perhaps the profit would not fall into next year's

  budget.

    I believe that this diminution of original research, which we deplore, is partly

 --due to a cause in which we rejoice the recent extension of science-teaching. The

 professorships of chemistry are scarcely more numerous now than they were twenty

years ago, while the calls upon the professor's time in conducting classes or looting
over examination papers have greatly augnientcd. Thus some of the most capable
men have been drawn away from the investigation of natm-e ; and in order to afford
them sufficient leisure for the purpose, means must be found to multiply the

number of the professorships in our various colleges.
   While the rudiments of science are being infused into our primary education,

now liappily becoming national, while pliysical science is gradually gaining a

footing in our secondary and our large public schools, and while it is winning

for itself an honoured place at our universities, it is to be hoped that many new in-
vestigators will arise, and that Britisli chemists will not fall behind in the upward

march .of discovery, but will continue hand in hand with their continental
bretliren thus to serve their own and future generations.

                      Chemiccd Nomenclature. Bij Di'. A. Crtjm Bro^vn.

   This communication does not contain a proposal of a new nomenclature or of a
new system of nomenclature, but was intended as a contribution to that critical
examination of chemical names which, it may be hoped, will lead to the develop-
ment of a sins'le language, capable of expressing clearly, completely, and shortly

the actual relations of substances to one another, and anij theoretical speculations

which are, or may be, entertained by cliemists.

  --Three difierent kinds of names at present used are considered : 1st. Proper

names, i. e. names which, merely in virtue of a convention, represent particular sub-
stances. 2nd. Names which indicate the composition of the substances represented.

3rd. Names which indicate the relation of the substances to others, and which may

therefore be called functional names. In a functional nomenclature each substance
will have more than one name, as it has more than one relation to other substances;

but no confusion need result fronr this, as eacli name will be used in its owTi place,
when the relations implied in the name are treated of.

On the Relative Power of Various Substances in preventing Putrefaction and

  the Development of Protoplasmic and Fungus Life, By Dr. F. Crace-

   Calvert, F.R.S., F.C.S., cj-c.

To carry out this series of experiments, small test-tubes were thoroughly cleansed

and heated to dull redness. Into each was placed 26 grammes of a solution of

albumen containing one part of white of e^^g to four parts of pure distilled water,

myprepared as described in  paper on protoplasmic life.  To this was added one

thousandth, or '026 gramme, of each of the substances the action of which I desired

--to study. The reasons why I employed one part in a thousand are twofold : first,

the employment of larger proportions would, in some instances, have coagulated

the albumen ; secondly, it would have increased the difficulty of determining the re-
lative powers of the most efficacious antiseptics in preventing the development of

the germs of putrefaction or decay, as the period of time required would have ex-

Atended over to twelve months.  drop was taken from each of the tubes, and exa-

mined under a microscope having a magnifying-power of 800 diameters. This

opej'ation was repeated daily for thirty-nine days, and from time to time for eighty

days. Tlie tubes were kept in a room the temperature of which did not vary more than

3°,' namely from 12°-5 C. to 15°-5 C, during the time these experiments lasted.

In order to appreciate the influence of the antiseptics used, I examined two solu-

tions of pure albumen, one of which was kept in the laboratory, the other in the

open air.

  A marked difference was observed in the result, the solution kept outside becoming

impregnated with animal life in less than half the time required by the other, while

as many vibrios were developed in six days in the solution outside, as were deve-

loped in thirty days in the one in the laboratory.

  A summary of the results of the experiments is given in the following Table, in

which the substances are gTOuped according to their chemical nature.

    In comparing the results given in the above Table, the substances can be classed

under four distinct heads, viz. those vrhich prevent the development of protoplasmic
ftud fungus life, those which prevent the production of vibrio life, but do not
prevent the appearance of fungus life, those which permit the production of vibrio

life, but prevent the appearance of fungus life, and those which do not prevent the

appearance of either protoplasmic or fungus life.

    The first class contains only two substances, carbolic and cresylic acids. In the
second class also there are only two compounds, chloride of zinc and bichloride of

mercury.

    In the third class there are five substances, lime, sulphate of quinine, pepper,

turpentine, and prussic acid. In the fourth class is included the remaining twenty-

five substances.

   The acids, while not preventing the production of vibrios, have a marked tendency
to promote the growth of fungi. This is especially noticeable in the case o"f
sulphuric and acetic acids. Alkalies, on the contrarj^, are not favourable to the
production of fungus life, but promote the development of vibrios.

   The chlorides of zinc and mercury, while completely preventing the development

of animalcules, do not entirely prevent fungus life ; but I would call special at-
tention to the interesting and unexpected results obtained in the cases ot chlorine

and bleaching-powder. When employed in the proportion above stated, they do not

prevent the production of \ ibrio life.

   In order to do so they must be employed in excess ; and I have ascertained,
by a distinct series of experiments, that large quantilies of bleaching-powder
are then necessary ; but the organic matter is also destroyed, its carbon being con-
verted into carbonic acid, and part of its nitrogen liberated.

    If, however, the bleaching-powder be not in excess, tlie animal matter will

still readily enter into putrefaction. The assumption on which its employment
as a disinfectant has been based, namely that the afiinity of the chlorine for
hydrogen is so great as to destroy the germs of putrefaction, is erroneous. The
next class to which I woidd call attention is the tar series, which gave no sio-ns
of vibrionic or fungus life during eighty days. The results obtained with sulphate
of quinine, pepper, and turpentine deserve notice. None of them prevent the
development of vibrios, but sulphate of quinine and pepper entirely prevent the
appearance of fungi. This fact, together with the remarkable efficacy of sulphate
of quinine in intermittent fever, would lead to the supposition that this disease is
due to the introduction into the system of fungus-germs ; and this is rendered the
more probable, if we bear in mind that these fevers are prevalent only in low
marshy situations, where vegetable decay abounds, and never appear to any extent
in dry climates even in dense populations where ventilation is bad and putrefaction
is rife. The results obtained in the case of charcoal show that it possesses no anti-
septic properties, but that it prevents the enianation of putrid gases owing to its ex-
traord nary porosity, which condenses the gases, thus bringing them into contact
with the oxj^gen of the atmosphere, which oxidizes and destroys them. The above
facts have been confirmed by a second series of experiments.

On the Presence of Albumen in Neutral Fats, and on a New Process for the
   Manufacture of Stearic and Palmitic Acids, ^t. Bi/ William L^nt

    Carpenter, B.A., B.Sc, F.C.S.

    In the International Exhibition of 1871 there were exhibited specimens of very

fine stearic acid, made by a new process invented hj Professor J. C. A. Bock, of
Copenhagen. This process the author had studied practically, and had extended its

application to vegetable fats.

   The disadvantages of processes hitherto in use for decomposing neutral fata were
pointed out. In the lime saponification, either 66 per cent.above the theoretical quan-
tity of lime was required, or else a very high pressure. In the various processes
of distillation the waste of material was considerable, and the risk of tire o-reat.
Where water alone was used, the high pressure required frequently burst the
vessels employed. The inventor of the process under consideration was a scieu-
                                                                                                                  '

--72 REPORT 1872.

tific man, of Ligli culture, in early years a distinguished surgeou, and till recently

medical adviser at the Court of Copenhagen. He believed tliat all neutral fats

were composed of minute globules of fatty matter, each one of which was encased
in an envelope of a substance which he termed albumen (in the proportion of 1 to
2 per cent, of the whole fat), the existence of which could be demonstrated by dis-
solving the fat in ether or benzole, and precipitating the solution with water, when
the albuminous matters collected at the plane of junction of the water and the fatty
solution. In his opinion, the excess of alkali, or of heat, or of pressure, necessary
to decompose a neutral fat, was required to destroy this albumen, with which were

associated many of the colouring-matters. By the use of certain oxidizing agents,

the envelopes of the globules composing neutral fat could be disintegrated, and sub-
sequently oxidized, so that their specific gravity was increased, and they could then
be removed by mere subsidence, leaving the fatty acids comparatively free from

coloui".

   In practice, the tallow, heated to llo° C. in an open vat, is well agitated with
G per cent, sulphuric acid for a short period, by which the albuminous envelopes
are charred ami broken up. Water is then added, and the blackened but still
nadral fiit boiled with it. Decomposition of the fat f/radually takes place, the

degree of it being judged of by the mode of crystallization of the fatty acids,

when it is complete, the water is run off, and the glycerine which it contains

is purified from sulphuric acid by precipitation of the latter with lime, and concen-
trated for sale. The blackened fatty acids are then subjected to the action of a

--solution of one or more of the following oxidizing agents sulphuric, nitric, and

hydrochloric acids, bichromate and permanganate of potash, and hypochlorite of
lime. The albuminous matters coagulate together, and increase so much in specific
gravity, that they subside in a few hours, leaving the fatty acids of a pale brown
colour. These acids are then washed, ciystallized, and subjected to cold and hot

hydraulic pressing in the usual manner. Tlie products are a stearic acid whiter,
harder, and greater in quantity per ton of tallow than that obtained by any other

method, and elaidic acid superior to that made in any other way. The iluthor of

the paper was engaged in extending the invention to vegetable fats. He illustrated

the paper with specimens from Copenhagen (sent expressly for the Meeting) and

from his own factory.

that a method might be suggested more free from error, and as readily adaptable

to the exigencies of shipboard as those hitherto employed. The author was the

first to adapt  the late Prof. W.  A.  Miller's  method  to  this  purpose                                        and many of
                                                                                                               ;

the results arrived at had been published in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society

issued in 1870. The samples of water were collected by a cjdinder furnished with

valves opening upwards, which was fastened to the sounding-line. When used

with certain precautions, it was believed that this instrument, simple as it was, left

little to be desired. The method of analysis consisted essentially in boiling about

750 cub. centims. of the sea-water in a vacuum, and collecting the gas over mercurv^,

absorbing the carbonic acid and oxygen with the usual reagents. Unless the

duplicate analyses agreed closelj', they were rejected. The average total quantity

of dissolved gas was 2-8 vols, per 100 vols, of water. At the surface 20 to 25 per

cent, of this was carbonic acid; but close to the bottom, at great depth.?, this per-

centage increased very largely, amounting to above 65 per cent, in one case.

In the more northern latitudes the proportion of oxygen was greater, and of car-

bonic acid less, both in surface- and bottom-water, than in the more southern.

The author then stated that there was a very generally received opinion that the

water at great depths contained so great an excess of dissolved gas, that when it

was brought to the surface, and the pressure thus removed, the gas escaped with

effervescence. Altliougli he had had long- experience of the collection and analysis
of such water, he had not seen any thing at all to support this view. While ad-
mitting that the pressure was suthcient to retain the excess of gas in solution if it
were there, the author was unahle to see where was the source of the supposed
excess, since there was reason to believe that every drop of water in the ocean
came to the surfiice at one time or another ; and when there, it became saturated,

or nearly so, with gas at the ordinary atmospheric pressure.
   In the discussion which followed, the justice of the view here put forth about

the supposed excess of gases in solution at great depths was generally admitted.
Several other methods of collecting samples of the water were suggested, and also
apparatus for their analysis; but none of them had been tried on board ship at any

distance from land.

Ignition of Cotton hy Saturation with Fatty Oils,

                  By John Galletly.

The fallowing experiments have been made with the view of giving greater

precision to our knowledge of the kindling of cotton or other exposed combustible

materials which happen to have imbibed animal or vegetable fatty oils. Graham

mentions* that "instances could be given of olive-oil igniting upon sawdust, of

greasy rags from butter, heaped together, taking fire within a period of twenty-four

hours." The danger of fire from this cause is familiar to those manufacturers who

coat any textile fabric with varnishes containiiig drying oils, and also to turkey-red

dyers, from the olive-oil employed in their process. Generally, it is stated in

AVatts's Dictionary that this combustion " may take place in intervals varjdng from

a few hours to several weeks, when considerable masses of lampblack, tow, linen,

paper, cotton, calico, woollen stulis, ships' cables, woodashes, ochre, &c. are slightly

soaked in oil, and packed in such a manner that the air has moderate access to

them" ( VVatts's Diet. vol. ii. p. 880 ). Nevertheless there is great vagueness about the
exact conditions in which actual ignition of the mass would take place, what size

of a heap might be necessary, and the various powers of different oils to produce this

result. Graham states, in the 'Ileport' already quoted, that the ignition of heaps

of the materials under discussion " has been often observed to be greatly favoured

by a slight warmth, such as the heat of the sun." This is a very important ob-
servation. The author's first experiments were made at a temperature of about

170^ Fahr., but he had some made at a heat a little over 130°, or about the tem-

perature a body acquires by Ij'ing perpendicular to the sun's rays ; the former tem-

perature might represent ithe heat attained in the neighbourhood of a steam-pipe

or in front of an open tire. For completeness, the author repeated, in this paper,

along with later results, some observations published a few weeks ago in the ' Oil-

Trade Journal.'                                               handful of cotton

wringing, was placed among dry waste in a box 17 in. long by 7 in. square in the

ends. Through a hole in the cover of this box a thermometer was passed, with

its bulb resting amongst the oily cotton. Shortly after reaching the temperature

of the warm chamber, the mercurj' began to rise rapidly, viz. from 5° to 10° every

few minutes ; and in 75 minutes from the time the box was placed in the chamber,
the heat indicated was 3oO^ Fahr. At this point smoke issuing from the box re-

the appearance of smoke, it was plain that the cotton was burning, and the whole
mass was soon in a flame on being placed in a current of air. On a smaller scale a

   Maw Linseed-oil, as generally supposed, does not so readily set tire to cotton as

the boiled oil ; but in two experiments, where the size of the box employed was 65
in. long by 4^ in. square in tlie ends, active combustion was going on in the one
ease in five and the other in four hours.

   JRape-oil put up as in first experiment on boiled linseed resulted, in two trials, in
the box and cotton being found in ashes within ten hours. The box being put up
at night, the result was only observed in the morning. In one trial the cotton did
not ignite in six hours. The chamber in the cases of this oil and raw linseed was
kept about 170° Fahr. ; with the five following oils at a little over 180° Fahr. The
quantity of waste used was loosely packed in a paper box, holding about the six-

    Castor-oil. The oxidation of this oil proceeds so slowly that only on the second
day the interior of the box was found to be a mass of charred cotton. Its spec,
grav. (963) is remarkably high, and its chemical nature very distinct from the
other vegetable oils tried, which no doubt has some intimate connexion with its

slow oxidation.
   Three oils of animal origin were tried with eifeets very distinct and insti-uctive.
   Lard-oil, an oil of an ordinary specific gravity, viz. 916, produces rapid com-

bustion in four hours.

   Sj)erm-oil, which has a specific gravity of only 882, and is not a glyceride,
showed its unusual chemical character by refusing to char the waste.

   Seal-oil, which has a strong fish-oil odour, not unlike the sperm, but a specific
gravity of 928, produced rapid ignition in 100 minutes.

    Comparing raw linseed with lard- and seal-oils, it would appear that the state-
ment is not altogether correct, that drying oils are more liable to spontaneous
combustion than non-drying oils. The author has also some reason to believe that
the rate at which oxidation takes place does not chiefly depend on the presence of
small quantities of ozotized or other easily putrefiable matters, but rather on the
particular olein. However, further inquiry on this point is necessary.

   The author made at least two experiments with each oil, and got remark-
ably uniform results. The ignition of the cotton can be calculated on for any oils
with about the same certainty as the point at which sulphur or other combustible
material takes fire when heated in the air; so that the term spontaneous combus-
tion may be objected to, for the same reason that Gerhardt objects to spontaneous
decomposition produced by oxidation.

   The heavy oils from coal and shale being chiefly the higher olefines, have a
remarkable efi'ect in preventing this oxidation, undoubtedly by giving a certain
protection from the air. Mixtures of these oils with 20 per cent, rape, gave no
indication of heating whatever at 170° Fahr. ; and even seal-oil, with its own bulk
of mineral oil added to it, did not at 135° reach a temperature sufficient to char

the cotton.

    The author hopes that these remarks will lead to a more elaborate inquiry into
this subject, both for scientific and practical purposes.

           On the Bust tlirown up hy Vesuvius darinr/ the late Eruption.
                              Bj George Glabstoxe, F.C.S.

    During the eruption which took place this spring a large quantity of fine powder
 which had been ejected by Vesuvius filled the atmosphere, and was deposited OA'er
 the surface of the country around. Some which fell at Oasa Miceiola, in the
 Island of Ischia, at 25 miles in a direct line from the volcano, was collected and
 subjected to examination. It proved to co^si^t entirely of silica and the magnetic
 oxide of iron. The microscope showed that the grains were very uniform in size,
 and consisted of an aggregation of quartz crystals dotted over with still more

minute crystals of the iron-ore, possessing a high metallic lustre. By boiling the
sand for a sufficient time in hydrochloric acid, the whole of the iron was removed,
and nothing but the perfectly white quartz remained. The specific gravity of the
sand was 2'08, and the gi-aius would just pass through a wire gauze, the apertures

of which measured the 1(9 ,000th part of a square inch.

   On comparing this with some ironsaud which occurs mixed with the soil in
some parts of the country round Vesuvius, the chemical composition was found to

be the same, though the grains of the older product were rather smaller, and pre-
sented under the microscope an unmistakably water-worn appearance. The spe-

cific gravity of these was 467 ; and they were more readily attracted by the magnet,

on account of their possessing a larger proportion of iron relatively to the quartz.

  Both samples differ from the magnetic ironsand of New Zealand (most probably

ejected from the volcano Mount Egmont) in not containing titanium; neither do
they contain by any means so large a proportion of iron oxide as compai'ed with the

siliceous nucleus.

   It is probable that the sand which fell during the recent eruption of Vesuvius
varies considerably in the relative proportions of iron and silica, and that as the
heavier or the lighter substance prevailed would be the distance to which it would

be can-ied by the wind from the mouth of the volcano.

        Onjlliform Native Silver. By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.B.S,

   Native silver occurs either in bunches of crystals or in threads or wires twisted

in every direction, and often bent at sharp angles. The fibrous or filiform silver is
tough and non-crystalline, though the threads are sometimes incrusted with crystals
of the same metal. It occurs in association with a variety of minerals ; for instance
with quartz in Cornwall, with pyrites in Saxony, with calc-spar in Norway, and

with greenstone in Chili.

  Now both electrolysis and the replacement of silver in solution by a more posi-

tive metal give the silver in a crystalline condition, and the crystals often closely
resemble those found in nature. But if nitrate of silver dissolved in water is
allowed to act upon suboxide of copper, there shoot forth after a little time white
filaments, which often run rapidly forwards into the liquid, or twist shai-ply round,
or perhaps even double back on their course precisely like the native filiform
metal. This under ordinary circumstances is only visible by means of the micro-
scope, and most of the threads are so fine that their diameter is oqly about the
-^jio^ of an inch, and a gramme of such wire would stretch from London to

Brighton. Many are very much finer than this, while others again are much
thicker. They never ramify or show the usual signs of crj'stalline structure.

Crystalline silver, however, will sometimes be deposited on these filaments, or tliey
will terminate in thick crystalline knobs ; and under certain circumstances crystal-

line tufts may make their appearance from the commencement. As the silver
grows, the yellow or red suboxide of copper becomes black in colour. The reaction

might be supposed to be

                      2(AgN03)-f-Cu,0 = 2Ag-fCuO+Cu(N03),,-

and no doubt this decomposition occurs ; but the solid residue was found to con-
sist not merely of black oxide of copper and threads of silver, but also of an inso-

luble basic nitrate.

   Mineral suboxide of copper was found to give the fibrous metal with silver
nitrate, just as the oxide which had been artificially prepared ; but attempts to
prepare the metallic threads by means of the chloride of silver in saline solutions
were unsuccessful.

On the mutual heljjfnhiess of Chemical Affinltij, Heat, and Electricity in
   ivoducinfj the Decomposition of Water. By J. H. Gladstone, F.B.S., and

   Some metals are able of themselves to displace the hydrogen of pure water, while

other metals are unable. Zinc, if perfectly pure, is just incapable of doing so ; but

if it he brought into contact with another metal still further removed from the

power of effecting the decomiDosition of water, the electric force started by the con-

tact of the two metals enhances the chemical affinity sufficiently to make it effec-

tive                   or  (otherwise                                                  expressed)  the joint  tension upsets  the  state of  equilibrium

between the oxygen and hydrogen. The junction of the metals may be made

outside the water by a wire, and the amount of action may be determined by a

Thomson's galvanometer. The effect of varying the distance of two plates of zinc

and copper was tried ; and it was found that the chemical action increases slowly till

the plates are within about an inch of one another, but on continuing to bring them

nearer the action increases at a rapidly accelerating ratio. If the water be heated

when it is exposed to this joint action of chemical and electrical force, it decom-

poses more readily. In experiments made with two plates about 1-5 inch distant

from one another, the deflection of the galvanometer showed that the effect of

raising the temperature from 40° C. to 80° 0. was more than double of that between

20" C. and 40° C.                                                                      but in an experiment made where the copper was deposited  in

   Arsenic in tlae form of small fragments and coarse powder, was placed in a thick
barometer-tube of soft glass and of small bore, well sealed at both ends and enclosed
in a piece of wi'ought iron gas-tubing-, closed at each end by an iron screw cap ; the
space between the two tubes was tilled with sand, well shaken down ; and the
whole was heated to redness by a charcoal fire. Another, similar iron tube,
placed beside the former, served to contain several little glass tubes with samples
of dift'erent metals, whose fusion might afford some indication of the teniperatm'e

at which that of the arsenic occm-red.

common sublimed arsenic, and even seemed to exhibit faint traces of flattening

before crushing under the hammer. It gradually tarnished on exposure to tlie air,

and presented all the chemical properties of ordinary crystalline arsenic obtained
by sublimation. The temperature required for fusion lies between the melting-

points of antimony and silver.

           On tlie occurrence of Native Sulphuric Acid in Eastern Texas,
               By Professor J. W. Maliet, University of Viryinia.

   Not far from the Gulf of Mexico, and within twenty-five or thirty miles to the
westward of the Neches river, there occur at several localities (in some instances in

the woods, in others in tlie midst of open prairie) small drainage wells and shallow
pools of water strongly sour to the taste. This sourness is due to the presence of

free sulphuric acid, which is accompanied by various salts, especially aluminium and
iron sulphates. At most of these points gases .are continually escaping (hydrogen
sulphide, marsh-gas, and carbonic anhydride), the bubbles burning readily on the

applicalion of a light.

   At the bottom of the water, in some instances (as at one point where, by means
of an artificial bank, a pond has been formed some 250 feet in diameter, known
locally as the " Sour Lake ") an earthy crust with intermingled free sulphur is

observable.

  A thick, tariy variety of petroleum is found oozing from the surrounding soil,

occasionally to such .an extent that sods taken up with a spade are set on fire, and
used to give light in the open air at night. At a point in Louisiana, some fifty or
sixty miles further east (where, however, the acid water does not occur, though
combustible gas and petroleum are met with on the surface) a most remark.able
bed of native sulphm-, 100 feet in thickness, has been reached at the depth of
4.50 feet by boring, and a shaft is being at present sunk for its exploitation. This
large mass of native sulphm- is more or less mingled with calcium carbonate, and
imderlain by gypsum.

   The circumstances connected with the occurrence together in this region of com-
bustible gases, petroleum, sulphur, sulphuric acid and gypsum, are of great interest

in relation to the mineral history of native sulphur.

   The sulphuric-acid water, which seems to be probably .altogether of superficial
origin, is worthy of notice trom the unusu.al strength occasionally attained. The
water varies yeiy much at the different localities and at different times. In one in-
stance a specimen examined by Dr. Mallet contained no less than 5 290 grammes
free sulphuric acid (H^SOJ to" the litre, or 370 grains to the imperial gfillon-- this
exceeding any amount hitherto reported from other localities, unless the acid spring

of the Paramo de Kuiz in New Granada be an exceptiop, examined by Lewy, who

does not state preciselj' how much of the very large quantity of sulphuric acid found
is uncomhined with, bases. The water of the Rio Viuagre, flowing from the volcano
of Purace in the Andes of Popayan, as described by Humboldt and Boussingault,

contains only 1-11 of free sulphuric acid (SO3 ?) in" 1000 parts of the water, with
·91 of hydrochloric acid.

   It is said, on the authority of Confederate officers having served west of the
Mississippi, that during the blockade of Southern ports the galvanic batteries of
telegraph offices in Te.\as and Western Louisiana were worked -with this native
sulphuric acid.

   The tube ozonometer is a square tube of four inches, and four feet long. It is
carried upon a post about fom- feet high, and turns upon a pivot, so that the opening
is kept constantly to the wind by means of flanges. In the middle of the upper
surface there is a slit, through which a clip passes into the tube, by which is sus-
pended a test-paper. The test-paper is changed every morning and evening. Twice
daily the quantity of air which passes through the tube is ascertained by means of
Biram's 4^-inch anemometer. At each observation the numbers registered by the
anemometer are reduced to square feet.

   Any one observing the crystals of Leucite implanted in the cavities of the lime-
stone blocks ejected by Monte Somma, the ancient crater of Vesuvius, may see cer-

tain streaks coveiing tlieir faces. The phenomenon will be found contiuuallv re-
curring, and in fact to be characteristic of the crystals of Leucite. That they obey
a regidar order is seen in fig. 1. The streaks are parallel, either to the shorter
edges, or to the symmetric diagonals of the trapezoidal faces. Parallelism between
the streaks and the longer edges does not occur. If the streaks extend to an edge,
they pass it and continue on to the neighbouring face in such a wav that the sti-eak
always remains in the same plane. This plane, if we consider the" form of Leucite

that is to say, this plane is a face of the rhombic dodecahedrou.
   Examining the nature of these streaks, the author found them to be not merely

superticial, but to correspond to plates of twinning. Sometimes the streaks are of

a perceptible thickness, allowing the observ^ation that their surface reflects light in

a somewhat different position from that in which the face reflects it, in which the

             Fi-. 1.                                          Fia

streaks are iiiibeldod. When, for example, a face reflects light in such a manner
that it is brilliant, then the streaks are dull. If now the crystal is turned round
an axis parallel to these streaks about 5°, the plates of gemination become bright,
whilst the face itself becomes dull. If the experiment is made where the streaks'

run in a diagonal direction over the faces, a smaller rotation (about 3^°) is required.
   It must be rememljered, however, that in the regular system a gemination

parallel to a face of the rhombic dodecahedron is not possible. Therefore it follows
that the crystals of Leucite above described cannot belong to the regular system.

   In order to verify this conclusion, the author examined the crystals, and found
those edges which ought to be identical, supposing the system to he " regular," dif-
fering from one another to the extent of 3^ 52'. The form of the Leucite is qua-

With regard to the twinned forms, a face of the octahedron (^« : a- a : c) is the

twin-plane.

The parametric ratio of the axis of Leucite is the following

a (lateral axis) : c (vertical axis) =1-8908 : 1, or 1 : 0-52G37.

   This ratio was derived from the measure of the lateral edge of the dioctahedron

   These data are an exact confirmation of the deduction made from the law of
twin forms. The crystallogi-aphic system of Leucite is quadratic, not regular. It
might be supposed that perhaps the crystals of I>eucite implanted in the cavities or
geodes of the matter ejected by Vesuvius were different from the Leucites included
in the lava of Vesuvius and of the neighbourhood of Rome. The author therefore
made an analysis of the crj^stals measiured above, and found the following compo-

sition :

  The composition of the quadratic Leucite is therefore the same as was re-
quired by the formula 3 and we must conclude that all Leucite, iiJiiplanted or

included, is quadratic. The way in which the octahedron and dioctahedron are
balanced in Leucite is an exceptional fact in mineralogy. The streaks seen on
Leucite under the microscope by polarized light are now explained; they are
twin plates. And the double relraction of Leucite is explained. It is not ne-

cessary to have recourse to the lamellar polarizatioa of Biot iu order to explain
the double refractiojj of Leucite. ^

 On the Amount of Heat required to raise Elementary Bodies from the ahsolute
                zero to their state of Fusion. By R. ScnEXK, Ph.D.

   The scale of absolute temperature is now so much used in the mechanical theory

of heat, that the[absolute zero of temperature has in some degree lost its hypothetical

character. Now, if we assume that a body at --273° is completely deprived of heat,
we can calculate the total heat present in it at any other temperature, provided that

--we know either all or several of the following data the specific heats in its three

states of aggregation and its latent heat of fusion and of vaporization, besides its

melting- and its boiling-point. As it aj^peared to me of interest to compare the total

heats possessed by different bodies in analogous conditions, I intended to calculate
them first for the gaseous state, as it was likely that any relationships existing
between them might then be exhibited in the most simple manner. Finding, how-
ever, that, with the exception of water, there is not a single body with regard to
which all the required data are known, I was obliged to confine myself to a few
elements, of which the specific heat in the solid state, the melting-point, and the
latent heat of fluidity have been determined. I calculated first the total amount
 of heat required by these bodies to be raised from the absolute zero of temperature
just to the point of fusion, by multiplying their specific heat in the solid state into
the melting-point, as expressed in the absolute scale, and adding to the product the
latent heat of fusion. The results are given in the last column but one, but do not
seem to exhibit any peculiarities. That some of these numbers are almost exactly

half as great as otherS; may be mere chance. By multiplying the numbers which

dilFereat elements by the atomic weights of the corresponding elements, I obtained

the numbers tabulated in the last column, in which we at once observe a remarkable

coincidence of the numbers for the elements cadmium, tin, and lead. Besides, it

deserves to be noticed that the second figure is in all cases either 0, 1, 2 or 8 ; so

tliat if we retained only the first figure, with the second as a decimal; the numbers
obtained woidd not differ very much from whole numbers.

   As the experimental data which I have used, although the best obtainable, leave
much to be desired, and as from the recent experiments of Weber it appears that

the specific heat varies with the temperatm-e, I will not venture upon any fui'ther
remarks, but confine myself to drawing attention to the fact that between the total

heats possessed by different bodies in comparable conditions, there seem to exist

numerical relationships which possibly may come out more clearly when more data

are be known.

On cm improved form of Filter Pump. By T. E. TnoEPE, F.B.S.E,

In the St. Petersburg Correspondence of the ' Berichte dor Ueutschen Chemischen

Gesellschaft ' (No. 7, 1872), Dr. Mendelejeff described a new filter pump, constructed

by Urn. Jagno, of Moscow. It consists of a tube about 1 metre in length, and from

8-10 millimetres in diameter, to the side of which, at about 3-5 centimetres from

the upper end, is affixed a side tube about 5 centimetres in length. The upper

end of the vertical tube is cut slantwise, and is connected by means of a strong

caoutchouc tube with a stopcock in connexion with the water-supplj'. In the hori-

zontal side tube is also fixed a caoutchouc tube at least 1 centimetre in outside

diameter, the walls of which must be not less than 2-3 millimetres in tliickness.

The end of this caoutchouc tube is pushed within the horizontal side tube, and ends

in a Bunsen's valve ; i. e. a piece of glass rod is inserted into the end, and the tube
is cut by a single blow on a chisel. The edges of the slit are thus sharp, and on

outward pressure being applied to the tube, they readily and completely adhere,

making a perfectly air-tight conjunction. The other end of the caoutchouc tube is

connected with the vessel to be exhausted. On allowing water to flow through the

vertical tube, the caoutchouc tube rapidly pulsates from the opening and shutting of

the valve.  Energetic suction is thus  set  up               and   it  is  easy  by  the  fall  of  water
                                                          ;

through the 1 metre to obtain a vacuum equivalent to 700 millims. of mercury. The

working of the apparatus obviously depends upon the principle of the hydraulic

ram ; it is readily set up at a small cost, and will doubtless take the place of the

Bunsen filter pump, as it obviates the necessity of a fall of 30 feet. There are a

few disadvantages connected with the use of the caoutchouc valve above described

owing to the diminution of its elasticity by long-continued working, its efficacy

diminishes after a time ; it not only fails to bring about rapid exhaustion, but it
permits of the back-fiow of the water so soon as the conjunction of its edges ceases

to be perfect. To obviate these inconveniences, the author has devised an improved

form of valve. At the end of the side tube is a funnel-shaped cone of metal, pierced

near its apex with a number of holes ; into the cone is fitted a sheet of unvulcanized

caoutchouc, shaped like a filter ; this presses against the sides of the cone, and

ett'ectually prevents the entrance of air or water from without. The' slightest

pressure from within is sufficient to disturb the adhesion of the caoutchouc and cone,

and to allow of the ti-ansniission of air through the holes.

   This form of valve is of a more permanent character than the other, and allows
of a more rapid exhaustion. In the new form of the instrument a manometer is

attached to the side tube to ascertain the degree of exhaustion ; and by a screw and

spring the rate of exhaustion can be regulated with the utmost nicety. Further,

bv means of a clamp arrangement, the vacuum within the pump can be maintained

without disturbing the screw, if it should be suddenly necessary to_ disconnect the

caoutchouc tube from the piece of apparatus to bo evacuated. This form of filter

pump has the great advantage  of portability                 over  the  original  one     of Bunsen                                                    it
                                                                                                                                                    ;

may be constructed in such a manner that it can be readily transported to any part

of the laboratory ; and it necessitates no alteration in the existing arrangements of

pipes and fittings.

            The Preciintation of Silver hy Copper. By Aifeed Tribe.

   It lias beeu recently shown by Dr. Gladstone and the writer that copper covered
with precipitated silver removes dissolved oxygen, as cuprous oxide, from a solution
of copper nitrate containing air, and also that the silver-copper couple moistened
with the same liquid removes oxygen, not only from the air, but from other gaseous

mixtures.

   In tlie course of the above and other experiments, it has been necessary to com-
pletely precipitate, at various times, large quantities of silver by copper, and it has
been noticed that the metal so obtained, after being thoroughly washed, always
contained copper. The constant presence of this metal was considered due to dis-
solved oxygen in the silver solutions, or to the absorption of that gas from the
air, by the produced copper nitrate, during or subsequent to the precipitation.
The experiments made with the view of ascertaining the correctness of this suppo*

sition are tabulated below.

   In each experiment there was employed an excess of copper, and in experiments

AC to I about the same volume of solution. In and B, pieces of copper foil of the

same dimensions were placed in open basins, and covered to about \ of an inch with
ordinary silver nitrate, i. c. impregnated with air. In C, D, E, bottles were filled
with ordinarj' solutions, and stoppered during the precipitation. In G, H, carbonic
anhj'dride was bubbled through the solutions prior to the immersion of the copper,
and the precipitation conducted as in C, D, E. In II, I, ordinary solutions were used.

On Dinitrohromlenzene. Bij J. F, "Walker, M.A., F.C.S.

  A series of experiments were made by Dr. Tli. Zincke and myself, to see whether

the orthomononitronionobrombenzene (meking-point 125° C.) and the metamono-

nitromouobrombenzene (melting-point 30°), when treated with fuming^ nitric

acid (spec. grav. I'o) and concentrated snlphuric acid, gave the same modification

of dinitromonobrombenzene, and whether one or more modifications were formed

by this reaction.

 We' found by treating the orthouitrobrombenzene in this manner, precipitating

with water and repeated recrystallization, that only the dinitromonobrombenzene,

which melts at 72°, was formed. By treating the metanitrobrombenzene in the

same maimer, we only obtained the same modification of dinitrobrombenzene,

melting at 72°.

The melting-point of each crop of crystals was taken.

The position'of the replaced atoms'^ of hydrogen are not known with certainty,

whether they are 1-2 or 1-3 or 1-4.  (See  Kekuk^  vol.  ii.  p.  515.

                                                                            )_
Both these mouonitrobronizenes are formed by the action of nitric acid on mono-

brombenzene.

If the position of the replaced atom of hydrogen in nionobrombenzene be repre-

   sented by the letter a,
the positions of tlie replaced atoms of hydrogen in orthonitrobrombenzene by

   n and x {x= position of (NO^)),

   and in metanitrobrombenzene by a and y (»/=position of (NO.^)),
then the replaced atoms of hydrogen in the dinitromonobrombenzene (melting-

point 72°) umst be represented by the letters o, x, y, and it may therefore be

called an ortho-nieta-dinitromonobrombenzene.

 On the Continuous Production of Oxygen. By J. Alfred Wanklyn, F.C.S.

   Tessi^ du Mothay has worked successfully a process by which oxygen is with-
drawn from the atmosphere and subsequently liberated in a state of purity. His
process consists in exposing manganate of soda to the alternate action of steam and
air at a low red heat.

   By the action of steam on the manganate of soda, oxygen is set free, a certain
quantity of the manganate being decomposed. By the action of air the decom-

posed permanganate is reproduced, and is ready to be acted upon afresh by steam.
   Commercially the process is a success. There is a point of great chemical

interest in the process. The steam is actually taken up in the operation and forms
caustic soda ; and it is highly probable that the following is a true representation of
the chemical changes which take place :

                            By J. Alfred Wankltn, F.C.S.

   It is well known that the proportion of acid derivable from an ether when it is
decomposed by means of alkali, may be determined with great precision. For
example, the acetic acid yielded by acetic ether may be titrated with accuracy.
The author proposes to determine the proportion of .alcohol obtainable when an
ether is decomposed by means of alkali. Tlie method consists in digesting a
weighed quantity of the ether with excess of potash or baryta, and, when the
decomposition is complete, in adding water, distilling off the dilute alcohol, and

weighing the distillate, and taking its specific gravity. There is no objection
to the addition of a weighed quantity of alcohol in order to facilitate the de-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;.

wards. The author had proved that alcohol may be distilled out of a strongly
alkaline solution with great precision. He regarded this determination of alcohol

as one of the most precise in analytical chemistrj^

     On the Manufacture of Chlorine by means of Mancjanite of Magnes'mm.

                                   By Walter Weldon.

   The process commences with the treatment together, in a still, of aqueous hydro-
chloric acid and a compound of peroxide of manganese and magnesia, which the
author calls manganite of magnesium. Chlorine is evolved, and there remains in
the still a mixed solution of chloride of magnesium and chloride of manganese.
This mixed solution is run off into a well, from which it is pumped into an evapo-
rating-pot, in which it is boiled down until it attains a temperature of about 300° F.
it is then run into a blind furnace, in which its evaporation is continued to dryness,
after which the dry residue is gently heated with access of air. Chlorine then
comes off, and there is at the same time reproduced manganite of magnesium, with
which the round of operations is then recommenced.

           Freliminary Note on the Preparation of Guaranine.

                         By John Williams, F.G.iS.

The fruit of a South-American plant named the Paulina sorhilis is prepared

and made into rolls by the Indians of Pana. Its infusion is used as a beverage by the

natives, and has an action upon the system much like that of coH'ee or tea. These

rolls are found in commerce under the name of "Guaraua;" and within a few

months an infusion of this body has been strongly recommended as a cure for sick

headache.

Dr. Stenhouse some years back examined this guarana, and separated its active

principle, guaranine, which he considers to be identical with theine or caffeine.

Considering it a matter of some interest, the author determined to prepare some of

the guaranine, and first proceeded to do so by Stenhouse's process, which he found

was a troublesome one in some respects, and did not yield the body so white or pure

as was desirable ; and as animal charcoal refused to take up the colouring-matter, its
ultimate purification became a matter of some difficulty. This led him to devise the

following process, which proved very satisfactory. Guarana is reduced to very

fine powder and mixed with one third its weight of hydrate of lime, and then

moistened with water and allowed to stand for an hour or so, then placed in the

drying-closet and thoroughly dried at a very gentle heat. This dried mixture of

guarana and lime must now be tlioroughly exhausted by boiling benzole, and

Athe benzole after filtration distilled oft'.  small quantity of light-coloured oily

matter is left, which must be treated with boiling water and placed in a basin, and

heated in the water-bath until all traces of benzole have been got rid of. The

liquid is then filtered through a proper filter so as to separate the oil, and the

coloui'less aqueous portion evaporated to a small bulk ; in twenty-four hours the

guaranine crystallizes perfectly white and pure, and requiring no further treatment

or purification of any kind.

The treatment with a little lime and solution in hot benzole is also the best

mode of purifying the brownish guaranine produced by Stenhouse's process ; the

colour is retained by the lime, and the product is quite white. Guaranine in ap-

pearance much resembles cafi'eine or theine ; and there can be no doubt that it is

identical with those bodies. The author suspects, however, that it is rather more

soluble in cold water, not crystallizing quite so quickly as pure theine, and also that

it is not so bitter. He has, however, not attempted to make any comparative che^

niical examination of the two bodies.

   The yield is, as stated by Stenhouse, large in comparison with the yield from

tea or coft'ee ; but the author haa not yet ascertained the actual percentage yielded
by this process.

   This process has been tried with tea, and it appears to work well ; but the author
has not had time to finish his experiments, and cannot speak with certaint}'.

   lie has not yet tried the process upon cotiee, and thinks it possible it may not

succeed well upon that as upon substances containing more tannin (or astringent

matter) and less oil iu their constitution.

       On Teaching Elementary Chemistry to Boys under 14 years of Age.

                           %Dr. T.Wood, i''.C'./S.

   This paper showed the necessity of having a compulsory elementary examination
in chemistry for all pupils under fourteen years of age, before they be allowed to

enter for the higher examinations requiring practical chemistry.
   It suggested the advisability of building iu all large towns a public laboratory open

to any pupils for practical instruction iu chemistry, because many of the present so-

called teachers in chemistry, having never had practical experience iu a laboratory,
do not tvavh well from want of such practice.

On a Modification of Hofmannas Apparatus for Electrolysis of Water,
                             By C. J. WOODWAED.

The extremely convenient arrangement of Dr. Ilofniaun for showing the compo-

sition of water by electrolysis is a very expensive one ; so the author has devised a

Amuch cheaper apparatus, made thus.    shallow glass has a stoneware stopper

ground iuto it, the stopper being perforated with three holes. Into two of these

holes fit the tubes intended to receive the gases ; these tubes are furnished with

electrodes made from ordinary platinum foil. Into the third hole fits a tube

enlarged at the top into a fimnel, to :receive the acid displaced as the water is de-

composed.

New Derivativesfrom MorpMne and Codeine. By C. E. A.Wright, D.Sc. Lond.,

            Lecturer on Chemistry iiv St. Mary's Hospital Medical School.

  Dui-ing the pastyear further experiments have been made on the derivatives of these
two alkaloids, in continuation of the researches described at the last Meeting of the
Association. The principal results are as follows :

   It was shown previously that compounds are obtainable from codeine by the

action of hydrobromic acid, which may be regarded as formed by a polymerizing

--action, the resulting products containing as their formulas fom- times as much

carbon as the original base and that analogous substances are formed by the action
of hydriodic acid in presence of phosphorus, hydrogen being also added on in
this case. Further examination has confirmed these results in the main, -nath this
diflerence, however, that the action of hydrochloric acid on codeine and morphine

appears to indicate that the formidce of these bases are double of those usually

ascribed to them, while polymerides exist containing respectively twice, three times,

and four times as many symbols in their formulae as the original bases ; so that the
following series may be ^vl·itten :

Codeine        .=G=G,,  B.^^  N,0,,    Morphine  =M=03i Hjg N^ Og

           . ..

Dicodeine . . =0^= C-^ H^^ N^ O;,      Dimorphine .,=M, = C|,j H.g N^ Oj^

Tetracodeine = C^=Ci,, Hj^g N^ Ojj     Tetramorphine =M^ = Cj3(, IIj^^ N^ O^j.

   Each of these bases is apparently capable of giving- rise to a large number of de-

rivatives, the substances described last year being mainly derivatives of tetracodeine

and tetramoiiihiue ; it has been found that the formulre there attributed are only
one half the true ones. In the codeine series all these polymerides and several
derivatives from each have been obtained. In the morphine series the polymerides
                                                                                                                                                  ;

themselves have not yet beeu isolated, nor have trimorphine derivatives been ob-
tained as yet with certainty ; but tetramoi-phine and probably dimorphine deriva-
tives have been obtained : some of these are formed by the removal of the elements
of water from tlie polymerides themselves, thus constituting " apo- " or anhydro-

bodies. It appears probable that apomorphine, the earliest known derivative (ob-
tained some years ago by the late Dr. A. Matthiessen and the author), is really a

derivative of dimorphine,

   Wheii hydriodic acid and phosphorus act on codeine, hydrogen is added on,
methyl is eliminated as iodide, and polymerization is brought about, one or other of
a series of substances being obtained, all denoted by the general formula

by prolonging the action, substances are obtainable of the general formula

When morphine is subjected to the same treatment, products are found which

are apparently absolutely identical with the corresponding codeine products

much fewer derivatives, however, are obtainable from morphine, the fact of there

being no methyl to eliminate and thus place the substance in a quasi-nascent con-

dition, being probably the reason for this diflerence : thus all the morphine deriva-

tives hitherto obtained by these means belong to the first of the above two series.
   Although most of the substances hitherto examined have energetic physiological

actions, allthese derivatives, whether from codeine or morphine, are, compfiratively

spealdng,_ inert, doses up to eight grains (0-5 grni.) being given to an adult she

terrier witliout producing any symptom more marlied than a peculiar land of

diarrhoea, lasting for a few hours.

 These results, together with                                                            those            formerly obtained,  indicate  that  codeine is a

_

kind of methylic ether of morphine, their relative formula being

_It is noteworthy that both from codeine and from morphine the same compound

+(M,+IIjJ 9HI - 4H, O, is derivable. The formula of this substance,                                                                               '

is incapable of being halved, and indicates that these iodized bases are really C,,^

mcompounds, and not C^.^ bodies as at first supposed. On account of the similarity

properties between these iodized derivatives and the chlorotetracodeine, bronio-

tetramorphine, Szc. obtained by the action of hydrobromic acid on codeine, the

formulas of these latter are also considered to be double of tliose formerly attri-

buted to them                                                                      i.e.  they are viewed  as  C,,ii-C,3c  compounds,    and  not  O.^-C,^

bodies. Inasmuch, however, as they still contain four times as much carbon as

the original codeine and morphine (these bases being doubled in formula, as above

mentioned), the old names are still applicable ; and this class of bodies, which are

specially distinguished by being amorjjhous and insoluble in ether, may be con-

veniently alluded to as the " tetra-hases."

To obtain the polymerides of codeine themselves without further alteration by

secondary reactions, the action of acids other than hydracids was examined. Phos-

phoric acid at 200° (the aqueous solution of codeine" in excess of glacial acid being

--gently boiled down) yields dicodeine, soluble in ether, amoiphous, but forming

crystalline salts and ietraaxhinc, much resembling in properties all the other

" tetra-bases " examined, being insoluble in ether and amorphous, and forming

amorphous salts. These two bases appear to be identical respectively with the

"isomer of codeine" of Armstrong and the "amorphous codeine" of Anderson,

both prepared by the action of sulphuric acid on codeine. On examining this reac-

tion a third polymeride was also found to be formed : this is amorphous and soluble

in ether, but forms amorphous salts; on account of its being in many respects in-

termediate between dicodeine and tetracodeine, it is considered to be tricotleine.

This base is not produced by the action of sulphuric acid on dicodeine ; this action,
however, gives rise to tetracodeine in quantit3^

Whencodeine is as follows.    dicodeiue is treated with hydrochloric acid, it under-

goes the following reaction,

         C_, II,jN, 0,,, 4IIC1+HC1= H, 0+0,,II,3 CIN, 0,,, 4HC1.

The resulting chlorinated base is soluble in ether, and gives amorphous salts : hence
it cannot be a tetra-base ; and hence it follows that dicodeine has a C^^ formula.

When dicodeine itself is similarly treated, the lirst product formed appears to con-

tain chlorine and carbon in the ratio of 1 to 3G ; whence codeine itself is a Cgg body.
Tetracodeine evidently belongs to the series designated as the "tetra" series; and
these have been shown to be C,,^ substances. Hence tetracodeine has double the
formula of dicodeine, which is double that of codeine ; whence the names.

   The action of hydrochloric acid on tri- and tetracodeine, however, is quite dif-

ferent : in the case of tricodeine, the elements of water are removed, and an
"apo" base containing no chlorine at all is formed; tetracodeine, on the other

hand, undergoes no change whatever when heated for a long time with hydro-

chloric acid.

   The action of hydriodic acid and phosphorus on codeine, dicodeine, and tetra-

--codeine is again very different, as exemplihed in the following reactions:

Codeine  40 +36HI=8CH3 1+4H, O+I10+ {(M.+IIj,) + 12111-4113 0}

Dicodeine.... 20,-l-25HI = 8Cn3 1+4H, O+I, + {(M, + HJ + 9III-4H,0}

Tetracodeine.. U,+18m = 8CH3l+2H, 0+ { M^           +10HI-2H,O}

   With the codeine Hjg is added on to M^ ; with the dicodeine, Hg only ; and with

Hthe tetracodeine, no at all : a tetra-base results in each case. The product from

^m,dicodeine has the formula C^^^ 11,53 '^'^a ^20)  which cannot be halved ; the pro-

duction of this substance (which is the end product of the reaction) shows again

that the tetra-bases do not contain less than (Jjgg.

   When morphine is treated with phosphoric acid at 200°, two products are ob-

tained corresponding in properties to dicodeine and tetracodeine ; these are not,

however, the morphine polymerides, but are " apo " derivatives therefrom. One is

soluble in ether, and forms crystalline salts though amorphous itself; this is pro-

duced only in small quantity, and appears to be identical with apomorphine,

--which is accordingly viewed as a dimorphine derivative

         2TI=4H,0+(M,-4II, 0) = 4n,0+C,,H,,N,0,.

The other is a tetra-base formed by the reaction

         4M=2H, 0+(M;-2H, 0)=2H, O+C^^ H,,,N, 0,,.

   This latter gives rise to new derivatives when treated with hydrochloric acid or

hydriodic acid; it is quite as powerful an emetic as morphine, according to Dr.

Stocker's experiments, but does not seem to produce so much after-prostration.
   Most of the above products have not yet received names, on account of their

complicated composition ; the term diapotetramorphinc has been given to the last-
described base on account of its having the composition of tetramorphine minus

two proportions of water, = M^ -- 2H,,0. Applying the same land of nomenclature

to apomorphine, this base should be tQnneiitdrapvdimorphine, having the composi-

tion of dimorphine minus four proportions of water, =M., -- 4H2 0.

  A large number of other products have also been obtained, and are now in course

of examination. It is hoped to extend the investigation of the opium alkaloids to
some of the less-known ones, such as narccine and papaverine. In reference to
this point the author cannot conclude without acknowledging the extreme kindness
and liberality of Messrs. Macfarlane of Edinburgh during the course of these re-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

searches these gentlemen have furnished gratuitously large quantities of several

alkaloids, including the rarer ones, and amounting in the aggregate to several
pounds weight of materials of the highest degree of purity. Without the help thus
liberally bestowed, the investigations would have been impossible.

                                              President of the Section.

The Geological Section is fortunate in respect of this year's place of meeting' of

the Britisli Association. The county of Sussex presents a -wide range to the g-eolo-
gical observer : there is the great freshwater Wealden series, next the entire Cre-
taceous gi'oup, then portions of the Nummulitic gi'oup, including the nnique fossili-
ferous beds of Braclilesham ; at Selsey is to be seenla remnant of a definite Tertiary
period, of which at no other place in England is' there any record ; lastly, the

evidence as to local conditions during the Glacial period is peculiarly interesting.

This rich field has not wanted competent labourers, foremost amongst whom must
be named Ur. Gideon Mantell, who in his day did so much by his zeal and know-

ledge to diifuse a taste for his favourite pursuit. There must also be added the
names of Mr. Martin, of Pulborough, and Mr. Dixon, of Bognor.

   It might perhaps be a fitting preliminary to the local communications whicli wo
may expect in the course of this fleeting, should I here give a summary of what has

been already done with reference to the geology of this South-east of England ; but

to many who meet now in this Section, very much of such a survey would be
Himiliar. Instead of this I propose to call attention to what is the peculiar feature

of our local geology--namely, its great AVealden formation, the product of that vast
lake or sound which, at a time before a particle of tlie chalk hills of Sussex had
been formed, covered an area larger than the whole of the South-east of this island.

What I shall eudeavom- to put before you, a point not generally understood, is with

reference to the place of formations akin to our Wealden in the records of past
time, to enable you to realize what were then the geographical conditions of the
northern hemisphere, what the distribution and extent of other areas of fresh
water, the equivalents of our Wealden.

       Thicc of the Fresh- and Brackish-water Formations on the Geological Scale,

   When a general view is taken of the successive physiographical conditions of by-

gone geological periods, it is seen in respect of each, such as those of the Pala?o-
zoic period or of the Mesozoic, of the Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Nummulitic,
which all represent distinct periods of past time and are all the products of
purely marine conditions, that what is at present terrestrial sru'face was at those
times to a great extent covered by water, and that the great geological formations
are merely old sea-beds.

   When on a projection of the northern hemisphere the known extent of each of

these old seas is represented, as on the maps exhibited, it is also seen to how

great an extent, at those times, the area of water exceeded what it is at present
 at each of these great periods the northern hemisphere must liave presented just
 such a preponderance of water as the southern hemisphere does at. present
 and it is further to be remarked how closely the area of one period of northern
 geological submergence corresponds with the others, as the Nummulitic with tho
 Cretaceous, and tlie Cretaceous with the Jurassic. Whatever the cause, there is to
 be seen in this a recurrence of like conditions at enormously long intervals of time.

    If next the internal evidence to be derived from these Mesozoic formations be

 taken, it is to be seen, as is familiar to most geologists, that each, when most com-
 plete, presents a like order of change from its older to its newer portions.

     Over the mid-European area, shallow-water accumulations, such as shingle
 and sand zones (infra- Liassic), preceded the deeper-water shales and limestones of
 the Lias. Jurassic Oolites follow upon these, indicating somewhat decreased depths
 for tlie Middle Jurassic series. Oscillations of surface mark this period ; and with
 respect to its physiogi-aphy, Mr. Darwin has given his opinion that ihe Malay
 archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas,
 probably represents the former state of Europe, when the Middle Jurassic beds
 were accumulating. Next follow deep-water depositions, when the widely spread
 liimmeridge series was formed, ending upwards with the Portland beds.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  91

   The Cretaceous group, as it is cxliibited here in the south of Euglantl, whore
its vertical thickness is very great, presents in its lower beds (Neocomian) a
marine fauna which indicated to Edward Forbes a limited sea, with depths not
(exceeding 18 fathoms. Sand-zones hundreds of feet in thickness overlie these.

The argillaceous Gault, in its composition and fauna, is a deep-water deposit,
followed by shallower-water sands (Upper Green Sand) indicating oscillating con-
ditions as to depth of water, to which succeeds the widely spread oceanic de-
position of the white Chalk. Here recurring conditions come aoout in like order
as in the Jurassic series ; and a corresponding illustration might be derived from
the physical changes indicated in the course of the Nummulitic period.

   With respect to none of these marine geological formations is there any indication
whatever that one passed into, or was in continuous sequence with, another,
either stratigraphically or geologically ; on the contrary, wherever there is apparent
continuity, either upwards or downwards, it is by change or transition from one
set of conditions to another wholly different. The purely marine Upper Silurian
beds of the Welsh border are followed conformably by the Old Red Sandstone,
which last is now universally accepted as a lacustrine formation, the place of
which, in time, was intermediate between the middle Palaeozoic group and the
upper or Carboniferous, which commenced with the so-called " Devonian." The
positions and extent of the " Old Red " lacustrine beds in all parts of the British
Islands indicate, even at this day, to what extent Silurian sea-bed had become
terrestrial surface, to which the lacustrine basins were subordinate.

   In the contrary direction, and in our own area, the next group, indicating widely

spread marine conditions, that represented by the Devonian and Mountain-Lime-
stone formations, sets in (as in North Devon) with shallow-water sands and a
marine fauna (Lower Devonian), in sequence to " Old Red " depositions with fresh-
water fishes and crustaceans. There is no continuity from " Old Red" into the
earliest Devonian beds, anv more than from uppermost Silurian into Lower "Old
Red." (Phillips's Geology of Oxford, pp. 77-79.)

   The later Palteozoic ocean-floor, now our Mountain Limestone, in turn became

terrestrial surface, on which the Coal-measures were accumulated, and over which
the abundant vegetation of that period established itself. The Coal-measures re-
present so much of the surface of their time as, from position, favoured expanses of
fresh and brackish waters, and alternations from one set of conditions to the other.

   Geologists are familiar with the amount of physical change which took place over
the European area after the coal-growth period. The subsequent condition of surface
which resulted is still distinctly traceable. The Permian-Trias period presents true
Aralo-Caspianconditions,physicallydefined,subordinate to the same continental area.

   The marine Jurassic series, next in sequence, was succeeded by that period of
terrestrial conditions to the more detailed physiography of which I here propose
to call your attention. It may suffice on this occasion to state that at the end of
the great Cretaceous period the area of those seas, in our hemisphere, down to
depths at which the great chalk floor had been deposited, became part of a con-
tinental land, on which the freshwater formations of the times which preceded
the marine Nummulitic were accumulated.

   These evidences of successive physical conditions over' the northern hemisphere
indicate an order of recurrence of corresponding conditions, and, as already noticed,
of a progress of change which, in the course of each period, came about in a corre-
sponding order. Great periods, during which wide marine conditions prevailed,

alternated with others of wide terrestrial surfaces. The marine periods, ns we

measure them by the products of the agents which seas and oceans call into action,
must have been of vast duration. In like manner we may feel assured that the
great freshwater formations are not, as some geologists have supposed them, mere
subordinate parts of the great marine groups, as our "Wealden " of the " Cretaceous,"
but rather true intermediate groups, of equal geological value with them in the

estimate of past time.

described generally as consisting of thick accumulations of sands and sand-
stones for a lower or earlier part, surmounted by a great argillaceous deposit
(AVeald Clay). Mr. Webster suggested the propriety of uniting the Purbeck beds,
Hastings sands, and Weald Clay into one group, the whole being mainly a conse-
cutive freshwater series. It must be understood, however, that there is not a

definite line separating the Hastings sands from the Weald Clay : all that is signified

is, that sands predominate for the lower, and claj's for the upper portion of the
Wealden depositions ; but just as thick bands of clay occur in the lower series, so
bands of sandstone occur in the upper.

   The arrangement adopted by the Geological Survey, in descending order, is :
Weald Clay,Timbridge- Wells Sands,Wadhurst Clay, Aslidown Sands, Ashburnham
beds (which, in Sussex, are the equivalent of the Purbeck beds of Dorsetshire).

   The lower sands are well seen on the coast at Hastings, whence they took their
name, and extend thence continuously to near Horsham, rising into the central
ridge of the Wealden elevations of St. -Leonards, Tilgate, and Ashdown forests.
On every side this tract is bounded by the Weald Clay, which extends to the ha^e
of the escarpment of the Lower Green Sand, beneath which it passes.

   This surface of freshwater strata, so defined, extends for seventy miles from
E. to W., and has a breadth from N. to S. of thirty-five miles. Over the whole of
this area the freshwater depositions attain a great thickness ; the lower sandy group

may be taken as 800 feet, and the Weald Clay as 4o0 feet at least.
   To realize the conditions under which these accumulations were formed, the

now upraised central sandstone ranges must be put back to their original horizontal

position, and the whole series must be regarded as the infilling by freshwater
rivers of what was an area of depression with reference to the terrestrial surface
of the time. This Wealden formation can be traced far beyond the limits of the
denudation of the S.E. counties. In a southerly direction it occurs in the Isle of
Wight, with its two divisions of Weald Clay and Lower Sands. In this
quarter the Weald Clay is reduced to a thickness of 68 feet. In a westerly
direction (Swanage Bay) the Wealden sands have a great thickness, and are
surmounted by only a thinnish band of Weald Clay or deep-water deposit;
and both divisions decrease rapidly in the extension of the formation across the
Isle of Purbeck, and liave not been recognized in the Isle of Portland, from which,
if they even extended there, they must have been denuded off.

   In a northerly direction, several sections about Oxford, as from Shotover Hill to

Great Hazeley, from AMieatley to Tetsworth, from Brill tlirough Long Crenden to
Thame, from Whitchm-ch to Aylesbury, extending from S.W. to N.E. for a breadth
of thirty miles, show Purbeck beds and freshwater ferruginous sands passing be-
neath Cretaceous beds. It is obvious that the Wealden formation has been cut
back in this quarter, and that originally it had a much greater extension. In this
quarter, too, the ferruginous sands overlap the Purbeck beds, showing that the lake
had here widened its area beyond the dimensions of the Purbeck lake.

   From Oxford* to the Vale of Wardour is an interval of seventy miles, from over
which the Portland Oolite has been removed, except at Swindon, at which place

there are beds which are unmistakably referable to the Pm-beck group ; and it is
a fair inference that it is to this denudation that is to be attributed the absence

of the lacustrine depositions which everywhere on our area, and on much of

that of continental Europe which was adjacent, follow next upon the Portland
stage. Such being the case, the smallest possible dimensions which can be as-
signed to the great Wealden lake, are that it extended from bej'ond Aylesbury
to Portland for 120 miles, and from Portland to to the Boulonnais "for 200

miles.

   From Rye to Portland the Wealden beds pass out of sight beneath the level
of the English Channel. The valley of the Channel is the result of the dis-

turbance which produced the E. and W. lines of the South of England, and

was produced subsequently to the Nummulitic period.
   Dr. Fitton remarks that, the subdivisions of the Wealden formation, especially

at its upper part, being in some measure arbitrary, it is difficult to determine to

   Such a difficulty existed when con-esponding portions of a formation were

supposed to require an  agreement  in  mineral character  and  composition                                                  but it

happened at all times, as now, with respect to the depositions withiji areas of water,

whether of lakes or seas, that the beds which were strictly equivalent in respect

of time, varied, from place to place, from marginal shingle to submarginal sand-

zones, and deeper and more distant argillaceous or calcareous mud-beds. Con-
sidered in this way, tlie distant Oxford and Buckingham portions of the Wealden

formation are referable to the submarginal accumulations of the great lake, and

may be synchronous with " Wealden clays." For the threefold division of the

Wealden series into Purbeck beds, Hastings sands, and Weald claj', must there-

fore be substituted the niore natural divisions of Lower Wealden for the Purbeck

series, and Upper Wealden for the series as exhibited in the S.E. of England, which

maybe of sand and sandstone or Weald clay according to local conditions of depth.

There are indications that changes in the area surrounding the Wealden forma-

tion took place in the progress of that series. The lower and earlier sandy deposits

indicate only inconsiderable depths of water. Yet the vertical thickness of the series

may be estimated at nearly 2000 feet: for that area, at least, progressive depression
must have been going on, but not uninterruptedly. As regards the upper and

lower divisions of the formation, the difference consists in the greater coarsenessof

the detritus of the upper, and in the evidence of strong currents setting in detinite

--directions, in an extension of the area and of an increased depth so that at the

later stage a central area of deep-water depositions may be defined, as well as the

directions in which such conditions thinned away. Great changes took place in

the depth of the water of the lake, as indicated by the alternations of the drift-

sand beds with deeper-water mud deposits, and in places by the conversion of lake-

bed into land-surface, upon which plant-growths established themselves for con-

siderable periods of time, and which were again submerged.

   Such changes as these seem to imply change in the physical geography of the

--land region to which this great freshwater area was subordinate such, for in-

stance, "as would give rise to larger rivers, gi'eater influx of fresh waters, and

stronger currents.

   The successive conditions indicated by the great Wealden group as a whole are,

for the first stage, that of an extensive shallow lake, or sound, at the sea-level of the
time, the inflowing waters to which were largely charged with lime derived from
the sm-face of Portland Oolite, from which they came. This is the Purbeck stage,

which commenced with a long period of purely freshwater conditions. Brackish-
water conditions followed, with a change of fauna. Mollusca such as Corhula,
Cardium, Modiola, Rissoa appear, presenting, as was observed by the late Edward

Forbes, the change of character which the Caspian-sea mollusks have at present

in adapting themselves to brackish water.
   During the Middle Purbeck series the alternations from fresh- to brackish-water

conditions were frequent and apparently of short duration, till finally it was closed

as it commenced by a thick set of pm-ely freshwater depositions.
   The changes in the Purbeck series are readily accounted for by reference to areas

of water such as occur on the American coast at present, and which may be salt or

brackish, according to the extent to which the sea-waters are excluded by sand-

bars from mixing with the fresh waters flowing from the land.
   The S. and E. coast-line of our Wealden lake must be looked for beyond the

area of our island.

                     WeaWen Formations of the European Surface.

The elliptical form of the Wealden elevation and denudation has its completion

on the east in Picardy, across the English Channel. In the Boulounais there occur

ferruginous sands like those of Siiotover, full of freshwater shells {Unio), over-

lying" Pm-beck limestone, and passing beneath the Cretaceous formation, just as

happens in this country. These Wealden beds are not now of any considerable

thickness, having been reduced by the denudation of the district. They are so

mixed up with pebble-beds in places as clearly to indicate a marginal line, which

may safely bo placed to tue nor tli of the Boulonnais denudation ; for the Wealden
depositions proper hardly rise to the level of the Palseozoic roclcs of Marquise. The

great fissures and pot-lioles in the limestones there, which have been produced
under subaerial conditions, and filled with sand, mould, and much vegetable matter,

had been produced antecedently to the deposition of the Gault over that area.

The Wealden beds of the Boulonnais were formed beneath the waters of the

same lake as our own. This freshwater area had an extension southwards ; thus

M. d'Archiac refer3;^the mottled clays beneath the iron-sands and sandstones at

Ilavi'e to the Wealden series of this country ; so that the limits of our lake in that

direction, or in the south, lay somewhere along the line of the English Channel.

   Sixty miles to the south of the Boulonnais is a district known as the Pays de
Bray, which is an elliptical valley of elevation and denudation, like our own

Wealden on a small scale, extending from Beauvais to Neufchatel, a distance of

forty-five miles. In this denudation the lowest beds exposed belong to the marine

Jurassic series (Portland Kiuimeridge). Next above the Portland stone is a

Wealden formation. "Les depots regardes comme fluviatiles sont les plus voisins

de I'etage Portlandien, et ferment le groupe iuferieur du terrain Neocomien

(Graves, Oise, p. 55). The remains of the fishes, Cyrencv, Ci/prides, and ferns are

such as occur in our Wealden.

Tlie thickness of tliis freshwater formation is inconsiderable compared with our

Wealden. The separation of the freshwater formation from the marine Portland

is well defined ; not so that betwixt the Wealden and Neocomian : here, as in the

Pimlield section, the freshwater and marine conditions seem to have alternated ; and

the manner in which this takes place suggests tlie siipposition that the influx of a

considerable body of fresh water from tlie land of tlie time took place not far

from this place.

Neufchatel is sevent}^ miles south of Boulogne ; the Wealden beds, as we have

seen, indicate that the series extended southwards from Marquise ; and it is no un-

reasonable supposition that the deposits of the Pays de Bray were formed under

the waters of the same lake as were those of our o-wm Wealden.

Such, then, Avere the dimensions of the Wealden lake, or sound. It extended

from parts of Buckingham, on the north, half across the English Channel on the

south, a breadth of 160 miles ; in the contrary direction it reached from Wiltshire

far into France, beyond Beauvais for 250 miles.

In another part of France, Depart, de I'Aube, M. Comuel has described a fluvio-

lacustrine formation between the Jm'assic and Cretaceous formations at Vassy,

containing Ic/iumodon, several .species of Unio, and Planorhis. The lacustrine for-

mation at Cimey is in a corresponding geological position.

In the Jura, Yillers, Forcine-le-bas, the Portland beds are followed by hard

bluish marls, calcareous marls, and gjiisum, the whole very like our Purbeck series.

These lacustrine formations are interesting, as they seem to show the existence of a

chain of lakes stretching across France into Switzerland for 2G0 miles, with a

general direction parallel to the axis of Artois, and thus connected as part of one

great lake-system with our Wealden.

In France, Dep. des Deux Charentes, some 3oO miles due south of our Sussex

coast, there occurs a great freshwater formation in intermediate position between

the Portland Oolite and what were then the lowest beds of the Cretaceous scries.
Like our own AVealden, this also is exhibited over a surface from which the Creta-

ceous strata have been demulcd. This formation has engaged the attention of many

French geologists, more particularly of M. Coquand, who has determined its age
and purely lacustrine character, and who puts it as the equivalent of the Purbeck

beds of England                                                                 in this he seems to be guided by the general likeness as  to  com-

position and the presence of Physu Bridowi, a well-known Purbeck species.

  --The sequence of events at this place was as follows : Subsequently to the for-

mation of the Portland Oolite the sea-bed became terrestrial surface ; and subse-

quently again to that a depression, extending from Chateauneuf, near Angouleme,

to beyond the Island of Oleron, became the site of a gTeat freshwater lake. From

St. Jean d'Angely to Chateauneuf is a distance of thirty-five miles ; and from

Chateauneuf to Oleron, S.E. to N.W., is upwards of 100 miles ; but then figures

do not give the full dimensions of this freshwater area, aa its deposits have

been reduced by denudation ou tlio north and pass beneath the Cretaceous series
on the south. The original Like must have had a westerly extension seawards ; and

its area must have equalled that oi' Lake Ladoga.

   The feeders of this lake are more easily accounted for than in the case of our
own Wealden. Such a lake would necessarily have received allthe streams de-
scending from the western slopes of a terrestrial suiiaco of very ancient date, namely

the oTanitic district of Central France.

In North Germany there is a well-exhibited Wealden formation, extending from

Bentheim by Rheine, with a breadth from N. to S. of twelve miles. From Ibben-

hiiseu it reaches on the S. side of the Tri.issic and Pala3ozoic axis of Osnaburg for

many miles. It is everywhere in an intermediate position betwixt the Upper

Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous formations. Ou the N. of the axis it spreads for

seventy miles to Miuden, certainly as for N. as the Steinhuder Meer near Hanover,

W.and as far S. as the Ilils district. From  to E. the ascertained extent of this

lake is upwards of 120 miles.

   At Bentheim the dark Wealden clays, with bands of limestone and spathic iron-

ore, with Cyrenep, Melanice, &c. like those of Sussex here, are 400 metres thick

so that the real dimensions of this northern lake were very much greater than

those here given.

   These largo lacustrine areas imply that there was at that time a corresponding

extent of terrestrial surface. And 'it may fairly bo asked, what is the geological

evidence of such a condition r* There occur over parts of Belgiimi the remains of

such a terrestrial condition of surface beneath the lower Cretaceous beds there

(Tourtia), consisting of variegated sands and clays, with much diffused vegetable

matter, and occasionally with bods of ligiiite ; sucb surfaces can be traced along

the line of the Belgian coal-field (Mons), and overlying parts of the Pa-lasozoic
series. These beds are not of suthcient dimensions to be termed lacustrine, but

have all the characters of the deposits of ponds and marshes ; and M. Bumont has
properly referred them to the Wealden period. Suchlike evidence of terrestrial

conditions recur over a wide European area ; such are the subcretaceous beds of
pisiform iron-ore, of subaerial origin, and the wide area over which freshwatej,"
sands with PterophijUiim, Fecoptvris, Cycadites, &c. of our Wealden arefound.

   The break betwixt the marine Jurassic and Cretaceous formations is very dis-
tinct, physically and zoologically ; and it may be fairly asked, in what way do the
forms entombed in the products of the intercalated period of terrestrial-surface con-
ditions serve to throw any light on what took place during that long interval of

time?                                                     . ,.  ,.

That the earliest Purbeck-Wcalden fauna should have Jurassic relations^hat is

to say, that it must have synchronized with such wherever that formation was

beinn' continued, is only whai might be expected ; for the whole of tlio bed of the

Jurassic seas in the northern hemisphere was not converted into subaerial surface

at once. Blidway in the course of the Purbeck-Wealden series there is evidence

of the recurrence of marine conditions, with Portlandian forms, such as Ostrea

tlistorta and Hcmicidaris juirbcclu'iisis. It was on this gTOund that Prof. E. Forbes

suggested the propriety of placing the Purbeck series with the Jurassic in syste-

matic o-rouping ; for it showed that up to the time of the Middle Purbeck beds

the marine fauna of the nearest seas was still Jurassic.

The considerable extent of land surface in the northern hemisphere during the

whole of the marine Jurassic period, and the local conversion of any portions of

such sea-bed into land, whether in the course of the deposition of the Lower

Jurassic series (Stonesheld), or between the lower and middle (Brora, StaiKn), or

at the uppermost stage (Portland), would be merely the addition of so much more

to the existing land.

   The forms of life which would colonize such new surfaces would be such as

migrated from the older adjacent lands; if any change took place in the fauna
or liora of such old land-surface in the coiu'se of the production of the marino

Jurassic series, it would be recorded in the forms entoniled in tl;c lacustrine

formations of the several stages here alluded to.

   The fossil plants and freshwater shells from Brora, Loch Stailln, and the
Wealden seemed at hrst to certain well-known and competent naturalists to show.

   The relations of the land-surface forms of the Wealden fonnations of the
European area have been recognized by all naturalists as being Jurassic rather

than Cretaceous. In this the Purbeck-AVealden gTOup offers an exact counterpart,

zoologically and geologically, of the Permian-Trias group just as the marine zoolo-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

gical relations of the Permian are Palfeozoic, so those of the Purbock are Jurassic
and when next after each of these, and after the wide spread of purely marine con-

ditions over the northern hemisphere at each period, the marine fauna is seen to

have undergone a complete change, in the one case Palaeozoic forms go out, and for
ever, to be succeeded by Mesozoic or Jurassic; in the other Jurassic forms go out and
thje Lower Cretaceous come in, and are those which interchange with the upper-
most Wealden fauna at Puufield and the Pays de Bray.

   Did time allow, I might call attention to the results of the labours of the dis-
tinguished palpeontologists who have described the forms of life of the Wealden
period, both of animals and plants. From them we know that Crocodiles and
Chelonians, referable to many genera, abounded in the Wealden waters. These,
with the Cycadere of the land, sufhciently mark the temperature of that time as being
much liigher than it is here at present. With respect to the numerous large ter-

restrial l)inosaurs, it is observable that as yet they are nearly all peculiar to our

Wealden lake. The relative level of tliis lalce seems tliroughout to have been

such as to have admitted of easy communication and interchange with the waters

of the sea ; and this condition may serve to account for some of the peculiarities

which its fauna presents.

On the Temperature and other Physical Conditions of Inland Seas, in their
   relation to Geologiad Inquiry. By Williaji B. Carpenter, M.D., LL.D.,

    F.11.S.

   After givin» a brief account of the Temperature-phenomena of the Deep Sea, as
made known hy recent observations (see Proceedings of Section A, p. 48), Dr. Car-
penter contrasted these with the Temperature-phenomena of the Mediterranean
and other inland seas. In the Western basin of the Mediterranean, the temperature
of the surface varies with the season, from about 54° F. in winter to 76° or even 80°
in summer. But the superheating influence of solar radiation does not extend
much below 50 fathoms, and ceases to manifest itself at 100 fathoms ; and from
this depth to the bottom, which in some parts lies at a depth of ICOO fathoms,
there is a uniform temperature of 54°. From the coincidence of this imiform tem-
perature with that which seems to be the constant mean of the earth's crust in the

--Mediterranean area, as indicated by that of the deep tanks in Malta, and of a cave
--in Pantellaria, the Author had thought, in the first instance, that it might be de-

pendent upon 6;((6jacent warmth. But subsequent inquiries have satisfied him that
it is mainly determined by the average «vV(<e;--tomperature of the area. As he
pointed out last year (Proceedings, p. 51), the marked contrast between the tem-
perature of the deep stratum of the Mediterranean and that of the outside Atlantic,
obviously shows that depth jjer 8e has no eft'ect in reducing Oceanic temperature,
and that the coldness of the Sea-bottom in the Atlantic must depend on a flow of

glacial water from the Polar area. He ice it may be concluded that if the Strait

of Gibraltar were deep enough to admit the cold stratum, the temperature of the
deeper portion of the Mediterranean would be considerably lower than it is. But
as the " ridge " between Capes Trafalgar and Spartel is shallow enough to prevent
the entrance of any but the surface-stratum of Atlantic water, the winter-tempera-
ture of which is as high as that of the Mediterranean, the latter cannot be chilled
hy it ; and the constant temperature of the whole mass of its water from 100 fathoms

--downwards may be regarded as its isocheimal, the solar heat to which its surface

13 subjected in summer expending itself in producing evaporation, and not reacbing

the depths beneath.
   In the Eastern basin of the Meditei-ranean, the axis of which is about 2° further

south than that of the AVestern, the constant temperature, as determined by two

--very deep soundings (one of them extending to more than 1900 fathoms) is 5^°,

which seems to represent its isocheimal, this basin being cut otf from the intrusion

of any colder water, except the comparatively small quantity that may come down

into it from the Euxine.

  Now one marked consequence of this uniformity of Temperature in the deep

Mediterranean basins, from 100 fathoms downwards, wiU be an absence of that
Vertical Circulation, which, in the Oceanic areas, brings eveiy drop of water at

some time or other into contact with the Atmosphere, and thus effects its aeration,

--the excess of Carbonic Acid which it has derived from Animal Respiration, and

from the Decomposition of Organic matter, being removed, and replaced by Oxygen.
Hence, if the whole of the deeper water of the Mediterranean is in a state of
stagnation, it might be expected to become highly charged with Carbonic Acid (its
Oxygen being proportionately reduced), through the decomposition of the large
quantity of Organic matter brought down by the great rivers,--especially the Nile
in the Eastern basin, and the Rhone in the Western. This has been found by the
Author to be really the case--the percentage of Carbonic Acid in the entire amount
of gas set free by the boiling of abyssal water in the Mediterranean being as high
as GO, and that of Oxvgen as low as 5, that of Nitrogen being 35 ; whilst the highest
percentage of Carbonic Acid ever met with in the abyssal water of the Atlantic was
48, that of the Oxygen being IG. Thus it appeared that nearly the whole available
Oxygen, in the abyssal water of the Mediterranean, had been used up by the de-
composition of Organic matter ; and this condition was quite sufficient to account for

the extreme paucity of Animal life in the muddy deposit which is being formed by
the very slow subsidence of the finest particles brought down by the great rivers

and diifused through the entire mass of Mediterranean water.
    Thus any deposit formed in a deep Inland Sea which is cut off from all but super-

ficial communication with the Ocean outside, and into which a large quantity of

--Organic matter, as well as of Mineral sediment, is brought by large rivers, might be

expected to be nearly or entirely azoic Edward Forbes's limitation of Animal life

 to 300 fathoms being generally true of the Mediterranean, though not of the open

Ocean.

   The Temperature of the Red Sea is probably higher throughout than that of any

--other Inland sea, the surface-temperature of its Northern part, even in January and

February, being never beneath 70°, whilst in the Southern it rises in July and
 August sometimes to nearly 90°, and the Strait of Babelmandeb beinp: so shallow

gave a wiifurin feinpt

Hence it may be assumed with tolerable certainty, that even in the deepest part of

--tlie Red Sea", where the bottom lies at more than 1000 fathoms, the temperature

·n-\]\ be never lower than 70° thus contrastino- very strongly with the temperature
of the lower stratum of the Arabian Gulf, which, having a temperature of about

--36°, must have come all the way from the Antarctic Sea. In connexion with this

high temperature of the Red Sea, it may be suggested as deserving of inquiry,

whether the reef-building Corals live at a gTeater depth in it, than they do in the

Tacilic. 'J'he inquiries of Dana fully confirm the statement of Darwin, that these

Corals do not live at greater depths than 20 fathoms ; and they have also led him

to the conclusion that they are limited in their distribution by the isocheimal of

Now68°.                 the question arises whether the limitation of Depth is not really cleter-

mined by Temperature ; and in that case these Corals should be found living in the

Red Sea at greater depths than in the Pacific.

A curious contrast to this, however, is afforded by the Sulu Sea, an area lying
between the N.E. portion of Borneo and Mindinao, only partly enclosed by islands

the iirst 200 or 300 fatlioms. But wliile the temperature of the Suhi Sea, which
is 50° at 500 fathoms, uevcr falls below this, even at ICOO fathoms, that of the
China Sea, which is 51° at 200 fathoms, falls to 37° at the same depth. As the
isocheimal of tlie Sulu Sea can never be any thing like as low as 50°, it is clear that

the reduction of the temperature of its deeper portion to that standard must depend

npou the entrance of cold water from the China Sea outside ; and it may be pretty

safely concluded that the depth of the channels of communication must be from

200 to 300 fathoms, so as to admit water of 50°, whilst excluding the deeper and

colder stratum.

   It is obvious that the existence of those peculiarities must have a very marked

--influence on the Biological conditions of Inland Seas and that, as like peculiarities

must have presented themselves in former periods of the Earth's history, the Lmow-
ledge of them may afford important aid in tlie interpretation of Palccoutological

phenomena.

    On the Ti-ee Ferns of iJie Coal-measures, and their Affinities with existhu/

                         Forms. By W. Cakruthees, F.li.S.

    Lindley and Ilutton describe two species of Tree Ferns from the Coal-measures,
both from the Bath coal-field. I have been able to add eight species hitherto un-
described, chiefly through the assistance of J. M'Murtrie, Esq., of Kadstock. These
belong to tliree groups, which are remarkably distinguished by peculiarities in the

structure of the stems. Two of the groups belong to living forms, while the third

is extinct, being confined to Palfeozoic formations. Cuulopteris and Ttthicaulis be-
long to the same type as the living ferns which possess stems, including under this

term the humble stems (falsely called rhizomes) of many of our British species, as
well as the arborescent ferns of warmer regions, and excluding the rhizomatous
forms like Pteris, Fob/podiitin, and IlymenoplnjUum. In all these stems we have a

central medulla, surrounded by a continuous vascular cylinder penetrated regularly
by meshes, from the margins of which the vascular bundle or bundles to the fronds
are given oil) and through which the parenchj'ma of the medulla is continuous with
that of the stipes. In most tree ferns the medullary axis is larger, and the bases
 of the stipes decay do\^n to the circumference of the stem ; but in Osmiinda the
persistent bases of the stipes permanejitly clothe the small vascular cylinder, which
encloses a slender pith. To this latter form belongs the stipe vvith a dumb-bell-
shaped vascular bundle, separate specimens of which I have obtained from tlie Coal-
measures. These have been described, both on the continent and in this countrv,
under the name of Zi/f/opkris ; but they belong to Cotta's genus TnhicauUs, ai'id
they are very closely allied to a group of fern-stems which I have already placed
together under the name of Chekpteris. The stcm-structui-e of the comiiion tree
fern is represented by the genua Cauhjiieris, of which I have six species of carboni-

 ferous age.

    The third and extinct group is represented by Corda's genus Steimnatopteris, only
now- known to be British, and by Psaronius, which, however, is not a separate ge-
 neric form, but is only founded on specimens showing the internal structure of the
 stems of which Corda's genus is the external aspect. The chief characters of Ptniro-
 nius have been drawn from the structure of the aerial roots which iu\-est the stem
 from which, indeed, the generic designation was derived ; while the structure of tJio
 stem itself has been overlooked. But this is really of the first importance as wiU
 appear from the follo-sving description which I have been al^le to make from' a finely
 preserved specimen of an uudescribed species in the British Museum, and from the
 fagures of Cotta and Corda. The circumference of the stem was composed of a con-
 tinuous envelope of indurated tissue ; within this there were perpendicular tracts of
 vascular tissue never penetrated by any mesh. Between these tracts the leaves were
 given off in perpendicular series, the large single leaf-bundles coming right out from
 the central parenchyma, in which the_y existed as well-formed bundles', filTiuf up more

 or less completely the medullary cavity. In one form {Zipped) the leaves are oppo-

 site, and the great proportion of the circumference of the stem is made up of the per-
 sistent and common vascular tissue ; in others (species of Pmronim) the permanent
 elements of the stem consist of throe, fom-, six or more perpendicular tracts.
                   TRANSACTIONS OV THJJ SECTIONS.                                                                     99

   The first two groups have the arrangement of the parts of their steins analogous
to that which exists in the first year's growth of a dicotyledon. In both there is a,
parenchymatous medulla surrounded by a continuous vascular cylinder, which is
perforated in regular manner by meshes i'or the passage-out of the vascular elements
of the appendages. The stems of the third group have a structure analogous to
that which is found in the stems of monocotyledons ; for in both we have the vas-
cular bundles of the appendages existing in the parenchymatous axis, and passing
out independently of any closed cylinder. The permanent elements, however, of
the circumference of the stems of Pmronius are without any analogue in mono-

cotyledonous stems.

. There seems, then, good reason for establishing two groups of ferns, vdth differ-
ences characteristic of their stems, comparable to those which distinguish the steins
of monocotyledons from those of dicotyledons. Cut the caution I have always in-

sisted on in dealing only with vegetative organs is specially required here ; for I

have discovered, I believe, the fruiting-fronds of one species of this group of plants.

With the Bath specimens of Stcmmatopteris insif/nis, Corda, as well as with those

found on the Continent, the fronds of Pecopteris arborescens are always associated.

It is the only fern found with some of the Bath specimens. It is also to be ob-

served that the bases of the stipes correspond with the size of the leaf-scars on the

stems. These facts are not absolutely sufficient for the correlation of the fronds

with the stem ; but they are the best evidence fin- this that we can expect in fossil

Nowbotany short of actual organic union.         the fruit of Pecopteris arborescens is so

near to that of Cijathea, that I can find no characters whereby they canbe separated.

Our classification based on the stems must of course yield to that derived from the
organs of fructification ; and our group of ferns instead of being made into a new

order, as it would be by some who publish on fossil botany, must be grouped with

a tribe of recent Poh/pocliace<s.

   It may seem that this is a forced and arbitrary gi'ouping together of plants that

in some important characters so remarkably differ ; and so it is, undoubtedly, to

those who with rash confidence generalize on tlie systematic position of plants from
stem-structure alone. But what can such objectors say to the practice of placing

in close proximity plants that are beyond question nearly related to each other in
ail essential characters, though some have caudiccs (Lasf.rea Sec), while others pos-
sess rhizomes (Pteris &c.) yet these two forms of steins are more widely separated

                                                                                                                          ;

from each other than the stems of the extinct palceozoic group are from those of the

recent forms.

On thejiresent state of onr Jinowledge in connexion ivUli the Bracliiopoda*.

                     By Thomas Davidson, F.R.S., F.G.S.

   In this brief notice Mr. Davidson referred to the attempts recently made to re-

move the Brachiopoda from the Mollusca and place them with the Anuelides,
Mr. Davidson still adheres to the view entertained by the larger number of zoolo-

gists, that the Ih-achiopoda form part of a class {MoUuscoidea) independent of, but

related to the Mollusca ; he remarks, likewise, that some characters of the Brachio-
poda are certainly very puzzling ; but it must be borne in mind that any inverte-

brate group may be " annelidized " by overrating certain points of its affinities.

   Mr. Davidson next alludes to the fact that the Brachiopoda are amongst the earliest

Imown forms of animal life, and occupy, after the Trilobites, the most prominent
place in the animalization of the globe. He then alludes to the many important re-
searches made since 1853 in connexion with the anatomy of the animal, a:i well as

with reference to the animal in life, especially by Messrs. Barrett, Lacaze-Duthiers,
Jeffreys, Forbes, Dall, and others, and which would tend to show that the animal

cannot extend its arms beyond the shell, is rather sluggish, and apparently insensiljle
to light. In 1853 he laid before the public a review of what had been done
by others as well as himself in relation to the classification of the Brachiopoda,
proposing at the time to divide the class into about forty-five genera; but
since then some sixty-nine additional genera had been proposed by twenty-four

    Mr. Davidson observes that it is also curious to notice that a general, but not

up to the present time, and that many j-ears must elapse before paljeontologists

Hemarls on ilie Genera Trimerella, Dinobolus, rtiicZMonomerella. By Thomas

   Davibsoit, F.B.S. cJt., and William King, Sc.D. and Professor of Minera-
   logy and Geology in Queen's College, Gcdwaij.

   The paper touched upon some of the salient points treated of in a detailed memoir
in preparation by the authors for the Geological Society. They propose the name
TrimereUida for a family to include the genera named in the "title. The typical
genus Trimerella, although possessing many distinctive features, is in their opinion
structurally and genetically related to Lingida. Reserving the discussion of the
first of these points to their forthcoming memoir, they gave reasons for holding
the view that Trimerella has been created, adopting the doctrine of gcnetheonomy,
out of some preexisting Liugulid. The internal features, most complex in tlie
type genus, were briefly noticed ; and their modifications, as characteristic of the
three genera, were pointed out.

   The chronogeological range of the family extended from the Llandeilos to the
"Wenlocks, the latest and only representative species of Dinobolus occun-ing in th^
latter rocks. The known species have been found in Canada, the United States,
Gothland, Eussia, and England : Dudley is the only English locality. The family
comprises about seventeen species, which have been instituted by Billings, Lind-
strom, Hall, Meek, Dall, Salter, and the authors.

 On the rii'/sical Geor/rapln; of the Mediterreineetn during the Pleistocene Age.
                              Bij W.' Boyd Dawkixs, M.A., F.R.'S.

   The geological evidence that the area of the MediteiTanean has been subjected

to oscillations of level during the tertiary period, is clear and decisive. Professor
Gaudry has proved, in his gi'eat work on the fossil remains found at Pikermi, that
the plains of Marathon mutt have extended far south into the Mediterranean, in
the late Miocene period, to have supported the vast troops of Hipparions, herds of
antelopes, and the very remarkable Mastodons and large Edentata which were re-

vealed by his enterprise. The restricted and rocky area of Attica, as now consti-

tuted, could not have afforded sustenance for such a large and varied group of
animals, nor could the broken hills and limestone plateaux of Peloponnese have been
the haunts of the Hipparions and the Antelopes, if their habits at all resembled those

of their descendants living at the present time. From this it follows that Greece
was prolonged southwards, in the direction of Africa; and if Africa were then, as
now, the headquarters of the antelopes, it is very probable that one of the lines by
which they passed over into Europe was in this direction. In the Pliocene age,
the presence of the Hippopotamus alike in Italy, France, and Germany can only be

accoimted for by the continuity of the African mainland so as to allow of the
migration northwards of that animal. It would seem, therefore, that then also the
 area of the Mediterranean could not have formed the barrier to migration which
it does now. But nevertheless the marine strata of Lower Lombardy, of Sicily,
 and of Marseilles prove that in some districts the present land was submerged
 during a part of the Pliocene age.

   ''iMiat was the physical geogxaphy of the Mediterranean during the Pleistocene age ?
The condition of Southern Europe at that time is an important factor in arriving at
 any true conclusions as to the Pleistocene climate in France, Gennany, or Britfiin

for if it be proved that a mass of land then extended where the MediteiTanean now
rolls, the extension must necessarily have affected the heat of summer and the cold

of -winter in Central and North-western Europe. I shall first of all take the evidence

oflered by the distribution of the Pleistocene mammalia of Southern Europe, and then

compare it with the conclusions which may be drawn from tlie various soundings of
Wethe sea at the present time.
                                will begin with the mammalia of the Iberian penin-

sula. The researches of Captain Broome, Professor Busk, and of the late Dr. Fal-

coner have established the fact that African mammalia, now no longer to be found

in Europe, lived in the Pleistocene caves of Gibraltar. I3esides the Lion, Bhinocvros

hemifcccJnis, and Ibex, they discovered the Spotted Ilyffina, and the Serval, both of

which are peculiarly African species, and which must therefore have crossed over from

that region to inhabit the caves in which they are found, or vice rersct To this list

a third African species is added by the African elephant, found, along with flint

implements, in a river-gravel near Madrid. The last animal has also been obtained

from the caves of Sicily by Dr. Falconer, in association with the Spotted Hyrena

(the Elephas antiqiais) and the Grizzly Bear, all of which were living at the time as

far nortli as the latitude of Yorkshire. It is obvious that the presence of the

African elephant in Sicily must have been brought about by the existence, in old

times, of a bridge of land passing from Sicily to those districts which it still inhabits,

just as the presence of the Grizzly Bear and Elephas antiquus in Sicily proves that

they passed over from their European headquarters before the existence of the

Straits of Messina. Nor are we without indications, from the study of the mam-

malia alone, of the position of the land which formerly connected Sicily with Africa,

A small species of extinct Hippopotamus {H. Fenflandi), almost as small as the

living H. liheriensis of Morton, occurs in such incredible abundance in the caves of

Palermo, that its remains were formerly exported for use in sugar-retining. This

animal has also been proved by Captain Spratt and Dr. Leith Adams to have li-\ed

in Malta, along with a pigmj^ elephant {E. Falconeri) and a curious gigantic dor-

mouse {Mijoxus vielitensis) ; and it has also been met with in Candia ; and more

recently I was able to identify the last lower true molar of the animal among ob-

jects which Dr. RoUeston obtained from a Greek tomb at Megalopolis, in the Pelo-

ponnese, and which was probably derived from some of the many caves of tlie lime-

stone in that district. For this extinct animal to have spread from Sicily to Malta,

from Malta to Candia, and from Candia to the Peloponnese, or vice ve7-S(f, the whole

of these islands must have been united together, and must have formed the higher

gi'ounds of a land that is now sunk beneath the waves of the Mediterranean.

This was Dr. Falconer's opinion ; and it is fully borne out by the soundings,

which prove that a comparatively shallow sea now separates the Peloponnese from

Candia, and Sicily from Malta, and the adjacent mainlands of Italy and Africa.

The great depth of the sea, no less than 140*0 fathoms, which intervenes between

Candia and the mainland of Tangier, offers a difficulty to the view that the land

liaa been sunk to that depth since HipiMpotamit^ Pcntlandi\i\eA\n the island; and

it is therefore very probable that tlie animal found its way from Sicily and Malta

by way of Peloponnese, rather than over an extension of the "African mainland. The

soundings reveal the fact that the Mediterranean consists of two deep basins, sepa-

rated from each other by comparatively shallow water, one barrier extending from

Africa, past the Straits of Gibraltar, to Cadiz, and the other reaching from Tunis,

past Sicily and Malta, to join Italy. The elevation of these barriers above water

would satisfactorily account for the presence of African mammalia among the

Em-opean fauna of the Pleistocene ; and we may therefore reasonably conclude that

they were then above water. In that case, however, the Mediterranean would

consist of two small land-locked basins, around which there would be comparatively

free migration from /Vfrica to Europe, and vice versa. In the map exhibited I have

represented the restricted area which the Mediterranean must necessarily have

occupied if the land were elevated to tlie extent of 400 fathoms, or the depth between

Candia and Peloponnese. The substitution of a mass of land such as this for a

stretch of sea in the ^Mediterranean area, could not fail to cause the summer heat

to be more intense in France, Germany, and Britain than it is now, while the in-

creased elevation of the land, to an extent of 2400 feet, would produce a corre-

sponding intensity of winter cold, as Mr. Godwin-Austen has pointed out in the case

of the liills of Devonshire. And it must be admitted that this condition of things

would react on the climate of France and Germany, and even of Britain. When,

indeed, we consider tliat the Pleistocene land-surface extended from Africa north-

wards as far as the huudred-fiithoni line, to say the least, iu the Atlantic oft' the

coast of Ireland, it is no wonder that the African animals, such as the Spotted

Hyrena and the Felis cnffer, should  have ranged  as far north as Yorkshire                                                                                                                   for the

only barrier would he that offered by the severity of the Pleistocene winter. The

Hippopotamus and the Striped Ilyrena found in the eaves of Lunel-Viol and of

Spain cannot be cited as evidence of a continuity of land between Africa and
Europe in the Pleistocene age, because they were European Pliocene species, and

may therefore, like the horse, have lived on into the succeeding- age without any

migration.

   All of these species, except Ccrms Matlieronis and TcsUtdo, liad been found by
the author at Pilieruii in Attica. In comparing the 1200 bones from Mount
Leberon with the 4940 bones from Pikermi, tlie author had been struck with the
variations exhibited by animals that seem to have descended from the same parents.

He also noticed that the presence of numerous herbivores, such as Ilipparion, Tra-

f/ocerus, and Ganiella, and of one so large as IleUadotherium, proves that a great
extent of meadow-land and a varied scenery must have existed at the end of the

Miocene period.
   The author considered tliat the fossils of Leberon are somewhat more recent

than those of Eppelsheim, but about the same age as those of Pikermi in Greece,
Baltaver in Hungary, and Concud in Spain. The age of the beds iu which they

--occur at Mount Leberon is very clearly seen from the following Table :

boring, namely the Kinimeridg-o clay, and, from the .absence of the next stratum
(the Coral-rag), and thinning-out and absence of others, he did not anticipate a

   some Inferences regarding the Condition of the Sea-hottoin and Shore-line

 . dvring the Deposition of the Strata. By Prof. James Hall.

During the year 1870 some excavations were made in Sclioharie County, N. Y.,

in beds of sandstone, referred at that time to the upper part of the Hamilton group,

but which probably belong to higher beds in the series. Several trunks, apparently

of tree ferns, were found in an upright position, with their bases resting in and

upon a bed of claj^, in which they appear to have grown. In this clay, and in the

lower three feet of the sandstone above, there were abundant remains" of vegetable

substance, supposed to belong to these trunks and to other vegetation of the period.

Principal Dawson refers these trunivs to the genua Psaronius ; and he has determined

two or more species from the locality.

The author believed that here we had evidence of a point of comparatively dry

land on the eastern margin of the De'^'onian sea. In tracing the beds westwards,

it was found that at first coarse sediment predominated with but few fossils except

plants ; but in going in a westerly direction the sandstones lose their coarseness,
Athe shales become finer and calcareous.
                                          corresponding change takes place with

the fauna ; for at first, Avhere shells occur, they are chiefly those of the Lamelli-

branchiata, and it is not till we have travelled some distance to the westward that

Brachiopoda are found, at least in any quantitj'-. Where both occur, the Lamelli-

branchiata are confined to the harder and coarser beds, and the Brachiopoda, as a-
rule, to the finer sediments. Not only so, but sometimes the coarser beds are

charged with a few species of particular genera, as of Aviculopecten, while others

are crowded wdth 3Iodiola-Y\\e forms with few Aviculopectens ; whilst Gninuni/sia,

a genus which may perhaps belong to the Uuiouidiie, has sometimes flourished

abundantly, to the almost entire exclusion of every thing else.

The changes here indicated can bo traced over a line of outcrop of more than

three hundred miles from east to Avest, and through a vertical thickness of from

two to four thousand feet.

The author inferred that this area during the deposition of these beds was

undergoing continuous oscillation of level, with a general downward movement.

He considered that the alternation of coarser and finer beds, with their character-

istic fossils, might be due to such oscillating movements.

 Below all these come the well-marked Lower Silurians^ the equivalouts of the

 British Oaradoc and Llandeilo formatious.
    Between the Middle and Upper Silurians of the United States there is scarcelj' a

 single species in common. Representative species occur ; and wheneTcr the phy-
 sical conditions have been similar during the two epochs, the species occurring in

 those beds bear a close similarity to each other.

    The author alluded to the opinion of JMr. Warshen, that the Lower Ilelderberg
 gToup should be placed with the Niagara group, and expressed his strong dissent
from those views. lie traced these rocks for several hundred miles in their
westerly range from the Schoharie valley, and said that in that direction the
Lower Ilelderberg group dies out, whilst the Water-lime and the Onondaga Salt
group considerably expands. To the east and south of the Schoharie valley the
Lower Ilelderberg group always occurs, and is everywhere underlain by the AVater-
lime formation. In Canada the Lower Ilelderberg gi-oup is largely developed,

whilst the Niagara group scarcely exists there.
   The author contended that throughout all this vast area the physical fact of

superposition and the evidence of fossils coincide to prove the Lower Helderberg
group a distinct and overlying formation to the Niagara group, and separated from
it by the Onondaga Salt group and Water-lime formatious, wherever these latter

formations exist.

   It appears, however, that in parts of Tennessee the Lower Helderberg and
Niagara groups do sometimes come into contact from the local thinning-out of the
intermediate groups. But upon this Prof Hall remarked that while the actual
phj'sical and zoological distinction can be traced in a westerly direction for more
than twelve hundred miles, in a north-easterly direction for six or eight hundred
miles, and for an equal distance in a southerly and south-westerly direction, lie
could scarcely suppose that the few facts observed within limited areas, and not
yet submitted to the test of comparison, would change the views of geologists upon

the distinctive character of these formations.

                   On the Chalk of the Paris Basin.

By M. HUBERT, Professor of Qeology in the Sorbonne, Paris.

This communication was made by M. Iltibert, as the result of his researches on

the Chalk of the Paris basin. It was illustrated by two sections, the first of

which represents the cliffs of the channel from Havre to Boulogne, the second

giving a section from Le Perche, a district which borders Brittany on the east, to

Belgium. The characters which, according to M. Plebert's classification, divide

the beds are so well mai-ked, that it is possible to ascertain the point where one

division ends and another begins. At this point not only does the fauna change

abruptlj', but also the lithological differences are equally clear ; besides, the sur-

face of one division is always hardened and eroded more or less. There is no

passage of the lower-lying hard beds into the soft upper chalk. These lines of

separation are always more numerous than the pala'.ontological divisions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      but two
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

paheontological divisions are always unconnected. These characters, in M. Ilebert's

opinion, remove all difficulty ; and in submitting the results of his researches to

those English geologists who interest themselves in the chalk, he hopes to convince

them of the exactitude of the divisions he has proposed; and he would refer them

to the cliff's of Kent, ^vhich afford an exact copy of those of the opposite shore

of France.

The divisions which M. Ilebert has established are as follows in ascending order:

   1. Glauconitic challv, the equivalent of the Upper Greensand and grey chalk.
   2. Chalk with Inoccrcmuis hihiatus, or chalk marl, and chalk without flints, and
a portion of the chalk with flints.
   3. Chalk with 3Iicraster cor-tcsti(dinarium, having for its base the zone of Ilolas-
tcr j)l(i>tus, and which corresponds to a portion of the chalk with flints.
   4. Chalk with Micraster cor-anguimnn, chalk witli ilints.
   5. Chalk with Bcknmitella inucronaia, Norwich Chalk.

The Chalk of the Paris basin forms several parallel folds, which correspond

with orogi'apliical accidents. Traversing the country from Artois to Brittany,

--they form elevations and depressions in tlie following order: 1. The axis of

elevation extending from the Boulonntais to the Ardennes (axis of Artois of

M. Archiac). 2. Depression corresponding to the valley of the Somme formed

in the most recent beds, viz. Chalk with 3Iicraster cor-anyuinum, which ex-

tends from St. 'N'alery sur Somme, passing hy Amiens, Longueau, and Moreuil,

where it meets the chalk of Meudon in the direction of Noyon. 3. The second
axis from Compiegne to Breteuil, which extends by the valley of La Bresle

as far as TriSport, which opens out in the lower portion so as to show in the

hottom of the valley the chalk containing I/ioccranws lahiatus, and on the flank

the newer beds dipping in the opposite direction. 4. Between this upheaved por-

tion and that of Bray there is a depression which can be followed from Criel-sur-

Mer to Beauvais. 5. The axis of upheaval of the district of Bray is seen on the

shore of the English Channel at Biville-sur-jNIer. There the Craie Glauconieuse

is visible at low water. There are several faults which are visible in the clifls.

This upheaved portion is much larger than the preceding one, and is seen as far

Aas Dieppe, where it ends, being cut off by a fault of about 200 feet. 6. very

well-marked depression exists between Dieppe and Fecamp, of which Veules

occupies the centre. There the chalk with 3Iicraster cor-anguinum descends to

the level of the sea, while both at Fecamp and Biville the Craie Glauconieuse is

at the same level. This depression runs parallel to the axis of the district of Bray

as far as Gisors, where the chalk of Meudon is seen at a much lower level than

the older beds found to the N.E. or S.W. 7. The ridge extending from Fecamp

to Meudon, by Rouen and Vernon. This elevation is accompanied by a fault

which, though in a somewhat broken line, still keeps a course parallel to the

general direction of the river Seine from Paris to Ronen. The sections show that

the strata have been raised on each side towards the fault between Rouen and

Mantes ; and consequently the valley of the Seine does not correspond to a de-
pression which would be the counterpart of the elevation of Bra)% The Seine

winds in and out, crossing the fault repeatedly. Beyond Mantes the fault passes

to Beynes, and is prolonged to Meudon, Bicetre, &c., where the chalk is elevated

and probably takes the form of an upheaved fold. 8. To the south-west of the

projecting mass of Beynes and Meudon a large depression exists, which seems to

take in the valley of the Eure as far as Louviers, and accounts for the presence of

Calcaire yrossier in this outlying portion of the tertiary basin. 9. To the south-

west of this zone, which extends from Trappes to Caudebec, the strata are up-

heaved, and the chalk with Inoceramus lahiatus is seen at the foot of the hills of

Le Perche. The sandstones of Maine crop up from under this chalk and form this

new upheaved fold, which has several flexures, and is followed by the fault which

extends from Nogent le Rotrou.

   Thus (1) Le Perche, (2) the axis of the Seine, (3) the district of Bray, (4) the
axis of La Bresle, (5) the axis of Artois from the Boulonnais to the Ardennes,
form five convex folds which are parallel and separated by depressions. They have

been produced by the general movements of the Paris basin, due to the contraction

of the earth's crust. These folds are of earlier date than the "Argile rouge a

silex " (red clay with flints), which covers up the eroded surfaces of the different

beds of the chalk, with the exception of the chalk with Belemnitella mncro>iafa,

which is probably of more recent origin ; for the lignites and the lower sands repose
at Veules, Varangeville, Criel, and St. "N^alery-sur-Somme on the chalk -withMicraster

cor-anf/uimmi. If denudation had taken place, it would not be accounted for by

supposing  that  the  chalk with  Belemnites was  entirely  removed  elsewhere                                   the
                                                                                                              ;

folds could have been augmented at a later period.

The two sections show the perfect correspondence of the several folds ; but their

regularity is shown by all the observations made. They approach each other towards

the north-west, and do not extend to the south-east beyond a line passing through

Paris from south-west to north-east. The folds are much nearer to each other on

the coast-line than inland, where they are separated twice as much.

Now, what becomes of these folds on the English coast ? It is certain that the

fifth and last of them, the a.xis of Artois and the Boulonnais, corresponds to that

of the Weald, and equally so that the Jurassic coast-line of Portland corresponds

with that of Ilenncqucvillc, near Troiiville, which seems to belong to tlio " Pcrche "

system, and of which tlie Ilavre beds are au exteusiou. The second fold seems

to poiut towards the Isle of Wight, where another dislocation from east to west

seems to have crossed it. The third and fourth, those of Bray and La Bresle, do

not appear to extend to the Hampshire basin.

 --Piirallelism of the French and English Chalk. The English chalk, taking the

chalk of the Kentish coast from Folkestone to St. Margai'et-on- Cliff as the type,

would be thus grouped so as to correspond with the diyisions established by

M. llebert in France.

I. Taking the Gault as the base of the chalk, on which point all are agi'eed, the

1st diyisiou of the chalk would be formed by the Upper Greensand, " gres vei-t

superieur," which is the snme at Folkestone, Havre and Fecamp, and elsewhere.

Tlie grey chalk (cruie (/rise) which coyers it is identical with that of Rouen the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          j

Ammonites varians, Mantclli, and rhutomagcnsis which are there found, leave no

doubt ; and it is recognized that in France the same fauna exists in the Upper

Greensand and the grey chalk, and that these two rocks alternate. These two

diyisions woidd form one, as La Craie Glauconiei<se. There may be some difficulty

in separating the grey chalk from the chalk marl.

II. The grey chalk is covered at Folkestone as in France (generally) by a very

nodular chalk without flints, and with grey argillaceous veins, containing Inocc-

ramus kihiatus (Tn-ongniavt), Ainmoniics nudosoides (iichlniev), Echinoconus siibro-

fuiidifs, Sec. This forms the second division of the chalk. The difference of the

fauna of this from tliat of the underlying bed is almost complete. Sometimes, as

Mr. Whitaker has observed, and has kindly furnished M. Hebert yvith his views,

at the bixse of this nodular chalk is an argillaceous bed witli Belemnites, which is
most likely the £. pleniis of Blainvilie. This bed is found in Shakespeare's CUff,

and has also been recognized in France in several places, more especially at

Neufchatel in Bray and Boulogne. It forms the base of the di-^ision termed

Craie a Inoceramus lahiatus. The junction of this bed of argillaceous chalk with

the underlying grey chalk will be found to be marked by a hardened and eroded

surface, which is pierced by holes.

   At Dover the thickness of the chalk without flints, with Inoceramus lahiatus,
may be considered from 12-j to 140 feet, to which should be added about 80 feet

of the chalk with flints lying above it in the eastern clifl's of Dover, <as they contain
exactly the same ftiuna. This division, like the former, is always terminated b}' one

or more hardened and pierced surfaces.

III. The next 13-j feet in thickness consist of a series of hard nodular beds,

containing beds of flint, the principal fossils of which are Holastcr planus (in the

lower part)  and JIulaster placenta (above)                                                                                                                                                           Ananchtjtes f/ihba is  also very common,
                                                                                                                                                                               ;

as well as Micraster cor-testiidinarium, vrhich gives the name to this division. The

lithological character is also well marked. It is seen just at the clifl' to the south

of St. Slargaret, at the level of the sea, and is there rich in fossils.

IV. Above the last-named hard chalk, a soft challc, often quite of a mealy aspect,

forms the upper part of the northern cliffs of Dover and the whole of the clift' north

of St. Margaret. This should be referred to the chalk with Micraster cor-angvimim,

abrmdant at Gr.avesend, but badly preserved at St. Margaret.

  AY. division characterized by the presence of Belemnites mucronatm, does not

exist in Kent, but only in Xorfolk.

It is very important to observe that each of the principal limits assigned to these

divisions corresponds in France with the places of thick beds which"^ are yvauting
in England. Thus between the Craie Glauconieuse and the chalk marl with Inoce-

ramus lahiatus, the great series of the sandstones of Maine and the limestones with

Ichthyosarcolytes is interposed. These beds are abstnt in the north of France

and Gerinany, as well as in England                                                                                                                                                                   also between the chalk marl with Inoceramus
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

lahiatus and the chalk with Micraster cor-testudinarium, as described above, the

gBreat mass of the hippuritic limestones should be placed. This also does not occur
in the northern countries. These remarks prove that the stratigraphical limits

which have been described indicate great breaks in the sequence, of long duration,

when no remains were deposited in the north of Europe.

   In a Eeport to the British Association iu 18GG by the hite Mr. Salter and the
author, Eamsey Iskud was mentioned as a part of the district which had been ·
examined, and a short description of the rocks exposed there was also given. Since
that time the author has had several opportunities of further examininfy the island,
and this year iu conjunction with Messrs. llomfray, Lightbody, Kirshaw, and

Iloplrinsou.

During- these researches all parts of the strata have been very carefully exa-

mined                            and  the  results have been highly satisfactory.                                                                                                                                                                                             The best section occurs at

bogiuning on the east side :

1. Liiu/uIa-Jiag^, a series of hard siliceous sandstones, with grey flaky slate, about

GOO feet in thickness, and containing LhujuMla JDavisii in great abundance, but no

other fossils, save worm-tracks and burrows, and some plant-like niarkino-s.

2. Tremadoc group, or, rather, a thick series of beds holding in the succession

relatively the same position as the Tremadoc rocks do in North Wales. These

beds graduate by almost insensible degrees from the Lingula-flags, first as bluish-

grey ilag, and then earthy grey thick-bedded I'ock, and assume at the upper end an

appearance approaching to that of the overlying beds of the Arenig group. They

have a thickness of frona 800 to 1000 feet; and fossils are very abundant through-

out the whole series. The species are nearly all new, and also' many of the genera.

A_
    list of the fossils includes four species of Brachiopods, ten species of Trilobitos,

Orthoceras two species, Ctenodonta two species, a Thcca, Bclicrophon, Encrinite,

and aStarfish, the latter discovered for the first time this year by Mr. Lightbody.

not previously been known to exist in rocks of so early an age. With the ex-

ception of the rocks in the neighbourhoods of Portmadoc and Dolgelly, we do not
know of any deposits of the same age in Britain ; and, indeed, until the discovery

of these beds at Ramsey Island, and some other places in the neighbourhood of St.

--David's, they were not supposed to extend beyond those districts.

They occur in succession to the Tremadoc group, and in true conformability. Tri-

lobites of the genera AsapJms, Ogggia, jEgliiia, Trinucleiis, Amptj.r, Ccdymene, and

species of Graptolites of various forms.

In this section at Eamsey Island the succession from the Cambrian rocks to the

Silurian is, the author believes, better shown than at any other known place iu the

British Isles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ^

               On the Graptolites of the Arenir/ Roch of St. David's.
                        By John Hopkinson, F.O.8., F.R.M.S.

   In the lowest beds of the Silurian rocks at St. Da^·id's the author had found a
considerable number of Graptolites, which, he thought, proved the equivalency of
these beds with the Quebec group of Canada, the Skiddaw slates of Cumberland,
and the Ai-enig rocks of Shelve.

   The Graptolites, of which more than twenty species have been determined, were
found at Ramsay Island and Whitesand Bay, in the lower part of a series of black
shales about 1000 feet in thickness, which, from their position and from the evi-
dence afforded by the fossils they had previously yielded, had already been infen-ed
to be of Arenig age.

   Of the true Graptolites or Rhabdophora the genera Didgmngrapsm, Tdragrapsus,
Liiganograpisiis (?), and Phi/lhgrapsus occur. All are Quebec and Skiddaw forma,
Didgmograpsns alone passing into higher rocks. The Graptolito allies are repre-
sented by the genera JPtilograpstts, Ucndrograpiits, Calhgraptus, and Dictyonema.

108 REPORT 1872.

These liave a more extensive range, Didycniema lasting from the Cambrian to the

Devonian period ; but until now they were only known to occur together and in

any abundance in the Quebec rocks of Canada. They have, however, recently
A.been discovered by the author in the Arenig rocks at Shelve.
                                                                  few specimens,

apparently referable to the genus RetioUtes, have also been found. This genus

begins in "the Quebec group (Arenig), and ranges upwards to the highest beds of

the Caradoc or Bala rocks.

Of the species many are new ; but all hitherto described are entirely restricted

to the Arenig group. All these occur in the Canadian rocks ; but only two {IJidy-

moc/rapsus putulus and Tetra(/rapsus serra) have previously been recorded from the

Arenig rocks of Britain. The entire Graptolite fauna is thus, in its species as well

as in its genera, more nearly allied to that of the Canadian Arenig rocks than to

our own Arenig faunas in Cumberland and Shropshire.

The species, of which specimens were exhibited, are as follows :

  A specimen of Callopraptus radiatus, with an entire " hydrocaulus," or main stem,

and a " hydrorhiza," the organ of attachment, was specially alluded to as furnishing
an important addition to our knowledge of the mode of gTowth of the dendroid
Graptolites. The hydrorhiza appeared as a series of interlacing or anastomosing
fibres, which must have formed a kind of network over the surface to whicii it
adhered. Its presence in this specimen was considered to prove it to be an essential
organ of the genus CuUograptus, its rarity being accounted for by its perishable
nature, and the probability of the Graptolite being almost invariably severed from
the substance to which it was attached at the junction of the hydrocaulus with its

hydrorhiza.

 " The other dendroid Graptolites (Ptilor/rapsi/s, Deiulrofiraptus, and Didyonetnd)
were also shown to have been most probably fixed forms.

                                     By James Howell.

   The author exhibited curious and beautiful specimens of minerals found in the

north-west portion of Brighton, the Montpellior district, during the excavations
for the main sewer. These excavations were carried through beds overlying the

chalk, down into the chalk itself, to a depth of from 22 to -30 feet. The surface-

beds consisted of vegetable mould, loam, and brickearth, the latter reaching in

many places to the depth of 17 feet. Imbedded in this deposit were masses and

veins of Websterite, mingled with brecciated masses of ironstone, flints, gypsum,
and indurated clay, frosted over and permeated witli crystals of selenite, varying
in form and colour, and presenting a beautiful appearance. There were also tabular
flints, probably a silicate of iron about f of an inch in thickness, coated with a
carbonate of lime, with nodular flints shivered in every direction, and recemeuted

by the Websterite. Some of the breccia, lying at the depth of 17 feet, so much
resembled " slag " as to deceive the eyes of good mineralogists. Most of it
had undergone intense chemical action, as if the gases had bubbled up and
escaped, leaving orifices upon the surfiice, or presenting a botryoidal aspect. Some
of the ironstone presented a honeycomb appearance, being of a black or dark

purplish colour, spangled with pretty star-liko crystals of solenite. Other speci-

mens exhibited contained a hig-h percentage of that useful metal, as much as from

55 to 60 per cent. Limonite, too, was abundant. Beneath the ironstone, in a

deposit resembling yellow oclu-e, probably an oxide of iron, lay a curious formation

containing mucli iron, gypsum, and indurated clay, mth seams of seleuite of a dark

green and purple colour. When broken, this stone was found to be beautifidly

variegated, and was susceptible of a high polish. The seleuite was so compact

in  the  heart  of this  formation  as  to  make  the  eye  take  it  for  quartz                            and one
                                                                                                          ;

gentleman could not be convinced to tlie contrary till he scraped it with his pen-

knife. Flints and iron and indurated clay were everywhere frosted over and

intercalated with every form and variety that the crystals of seleuite could assume,

forming magnificent specimens of nature's workmanship for either the museum or

the drawing-room.

   The author next gave a detailed description of the discovery, history, and

composition of Websterite, displaying some tine specimens, and stating that there
were still hner oues in the British and Brighton Museums. About 3 feet from
the surface of the road in Powis Villas, the workmen discovered what had every
appearance of the petrified trunlc of a tree, the bark being changed into lignite, and
tlie woody structure into a white fibrous substance, witli medullary rays verging

from the centre. Two fine specimens of this, in the Brighton Museum, were first
marked as " fossilized trees." Upon analyzation, however, by Dr. Flight of the

British Museum, the fibrous substance proved to be Websterite, and_ the ligneous-
like coating manganese witli a small proportion of cobalt. Testino- it with hydro-

chloric acid also reveals the presence of a carbonate, whether of lime, alumina, or
some other substance the author does not know. The Websterite lying in the
clay or brickearth was in a very friable state, of a milk-white colour, and which
might be mistaken by the eye for magnesia. Other specimens were more compact
and of a straw-colour ; and in the core of one of these specimens lay imbedded
what appeared to be very like a small, smooth, dark-coloured flint ; but flint it
was not, but the same substance probably coloured either by manganese or iron.

Another pretty specimen in the mineralog'ical department of the Brighton Museum

has a beautiful straw-coloured coating of what analyzation might prove to be

allophane.

   Mr. Howell then entered into the origin of the specimens exhibited, stating that
observations had convinced him that it was chemical agency, and that such was
as active now in the beds above the chalk in the Montpellier district at Brighton
and elsewhere as ever it had been during the deposition of the Eocene strata, to

which these beds geologically belonged.

                                      Bij James Howell.

   This paper was the result of observations made by Mr, Howell during the pro-

gress of the excavations for the purpose of draining the town of Brighton in tlie
years 1870 and 1871. According to Mr. Howell, the town of Brighton stands upon

six distinct formations :

   1. Chalk with flints, upon the crests of the liills and their abrupt descents.

   2. Lower Eocene, constituting Furze Hill.
   3. Temple Field deposit, formed of the ruins of the Eocene and Clialk strata. In
the Montpellier district, sloping down the western hill towards Furze Hill and

Hove Level.
   4. Postpliocene, Brighton cliff formation, Coombe rock or Elephant-bed, chiefly

East Brighton, especially the cliffs at Black Rock, also the base of the silt in the

Brighton valley.

   5. Postpliocene brickearth, resting on Coombe rock or sand. Hove and \V estern

    Leaving the Cretaceous strata, so ably explored and so graphically described by

Dr. Mantell, the author drew attention to Furze Hill as one of the remnants left

l)y denudation of the plastic clay in Sussex, first determined by Sir Roderick Mut-

chison in 1850, but more tliorougbly inveslip;ated by Mr. Montague Phillips in

1851, who found it to consist of layers of marl and clay, the upper part composed

of comminuted marine shells, the clays being of various coloui's, a bed of lignite,
4 feet thick, containing- much sulphur, analogous to that found in the Paris and

Hampshire tertiary basins. Faint impressions of dicotyledonous trees were also

detected upon the clay. Mr. Phillips also discovered a cluster of fossil fruits of an

unknown species, intermediate between the Brazilnut and AValnut, with crystals of

selenite among tlie clays, and a thui vein of subsulphate of alumina in an outcrop

of what he considered the same formation at Preston\'ille. Patches of the lower

Tertiaries are to be seen here and there over the whole area of tlie South Downs,

whilst scattered over their surface are water-rolled specimens of the breccia form-

ing the base of the tertiary deposits at Seaford and Newliaveu, together witli

" grey weathers " or druid sandstones ; while within 200 or 300 yards of tlie

Eocene strata at Furze Hill, the excavations for draining the town of Brighton

revealed the ruins of the plastic clay once lying in situ in that localitj', consisting

of clays and sand, breccia of angular flints impregnated vsdth iron, ironstone, gyp-
sum, subsulphate and hydrate of alumina, loamy deposits, crystals of selenite, and

ferruginous chalk-rubble. The upper portion of this heterogeneous mass consists

of a cliocolate or yellowish loam, and in many plr.ce?, where the chalk immediately

underlies it, of ironstone or breccia impregnated with iron, in which case the sub-

cretaceous strata are in every stage of decomposition. TJie loam contains chalk-

like granules, which, on being exposed to atmospheric action, crumble into a fine

ochraceous powder. This is probably effected by the percolation of water highly

charged with acids derived from the soil, iron, or decomposing iron-pyrites, which,

lilce a disease, eats deep down into the core of the chalk, and eventually converts it

into the ochraceous tree-bearing loam, such as forms the soil of the ISIontpellier

district and of the copse by the roadside to the dyke. The claA's or brickearth, if

it be such, the author believes to be of a date anterior to that lying in the Hove

Levels. The breccia, in immense masses, lies mingled with the clays and chalk-

rubble as if it had been torn from its bed by some mighty force. Hundreds of tons

were extracted from an excavation 2 feet 6 inches in width at tlie bottom of Clif-

ton Hill at its junction with Montpellier lload up to St. Michael's Place, where

it lay piled up like a wall to the height of 5 feet. This interesting section was

showed upon the plan which the engineer of the works, Mr. Good, kindly pre^iarcd

for the author. Much of this conglomerate has undergone intense chemical action,

some specimens being scarcel}' recognizable from " slag." Many of its cores are

ornamented with calcites, crystals of selenite, and gaseous botiyoidal bubbles coated

with a delicate bloom of violet, yellow, and green. The subsulphate and hydrate

of alumina lie in veins and masses imbedded in the claj-s, from a milk-white

powdery substance up to the consistence of gypsum. One specimen assumed the

form of a trunk of a tree ; its lignite-like coating, on being analyzed by Dr. Flight,
of the British Museum, was, however, found to consist of manganese, together with

a small proportion of cobalt. Far from being a scarce mineral, the author de-

scribed it as being plentifully spread over the chalk-districts wherever ironstone or
iron-pyrites was superimposed upon clay. Specimens of the tree-like variety the

author had extracted from chalk in which it was completely isolated, the chalk

matrix showing no signs of decomposition. He had found portions of clay, too,

similarly isolated                                                                       in  chalk-strata with  no appearance of  rents or fissures                                                                         and the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

formed ?

   Mr._ Howell, in describing the Coomlie rock or Elephant-bed, drew attention to
the cliffs at Black Rock, consisting of this peculiar deposit superimposed upon an

old sea-beach lying from 12 to Is feet in the cliff" above the present one, finer

sections for inspection being nowhere visible. Sir Rodericlc Murchison and Mr.

God win-Austen state that brickearth is the equivalent of Coombe rock, both being'

of the same age                                                                          but the observations of the author during the excavations througk

 rubble, wiiicli was tbe same formation witli a less admixture of clays. Bones and
teetb of the Mammoth, the Horse, Ox, Deer, and Whale, &c. were found imbedded
 in the two deposits, which showed that they were not far removed from each otlier

 in g-eolog-ical sequence. In speaking of the old sea-beach, the author doubted its
 existence, as stated by Mantell, 50 feet beneath the surface of the Western Road,

which consists almost entirely of chalk from its commencement to Western
Cottages, where the Coombe rock makes its appearance, followed by brickearth,
which there overlies it. Mr. Howell inclines to the opinion that the clays of the
Coombe rock and brickearlhs, as well as the lignite, breccia, and sandstones of the

former deposit, were derived by denudation from tiio tertiary strata of the South
Downs, in the same manner as those tertiaries might have been derived from the
denudation of the Wealden.

   Coming down to the recent periods, the author described the Brighton valley as
consisting of silt and flints resting upon Coombe rock, in which were imbedded im-
mense quantities of water-rolled sandstones, similar to the " grey weathers," the whole
deposit pointing to a time when the valley was an estuary of the sea as high up as
the London and Lewes Roads, then the beds of rivers, one possibly issuing from
the Weald, the other probably from the high hills round about the village of
Fahner. Pebbles, exactly the same as those lying on the Brighton beach, were
dug up at a depth of 11 feet in the valley, above the new church, lying in Coombe

rock, which had everj^ appearance of haA'ing been the bed of a stream. Few or no

specimens of paleeozoic pebbles were met with similar to those in the old sea-
beach, the author inclining to the views of Mr. Godwin-Austen, of a coast-line
extending from Colvados across the Channel to Sussex in Postpliocene times, dry

land being to the east of this coast-line, whose beach was the same as that now

found in the Brighton cliffs, along wbicli the palosozoic pebbles found in the old se.a-

beach travelled from France, giving illustrations of pebble -travelling that came
under his own observation in the Isle of Win-lit.

On fhe Traclujte Porjjlii/ries of Antrim and Down, in ilie North of Ireland.
   Bij Professor Edwaed Hxtll, M.A., F.li.S., F.G.S., Director of tlie Geological

   Survey of Ireland.

   Trachyte is one of the rarest of the British rocks, and it is as j'et uncertain whether
it is to be found amongst these islands except in the north of Ireland. In this

district it was identified by the late Professor Jukes and Mr. Du Noyer during the

progTcss of the Geological Survey in the year 1807. Under the name of "clay-
J)orphyry " of Sandy-brae, it is described by Ih-. Berger in his paper " On the Geo-

 ogical Features of the North-east of Ireland " * ; and the author gives a short
account of its characters and relations to the surrounding formations as it occurs

--both in Antrim and Down f-
   Trachyte Porphyry of Antrim. The principal mass forms a group of emineneea
about four miles to the north of the town of Antrim, called Tardree Mountain,
Carnearny Hill (104.3 ft.), Brown Dod Hill, and Scolboa Hill. The tops of three of
these hills are formed of basalt in beds capping the trachytic rocks; and it is sup-
posed that basaltic sheets enclose the whole of the trachytic district, though the
survey of the district being incomplete, the actual limits have not been determined

in every direction.

   The mineral constitution of the trach3'te is generally uniform, although the

relative proportions of the individual minerals occasionally vary. In general the
rock consists of a nearly white or grey felspathic base, with individual crystals of
sanidine and a triclinic felspar, blebs or grains of smoke-quartz, and rarely a little

mica. In some places the giaius of silica are exceedingly abundant, giving the
rock the appearance of rhyolite orperlite, as described by L. von Cotta. Minute

crystalline grains of magnetite appear in a sliced section. It is in this state that

Both at Carnearny and Tardree Hills tlie trachyte porphyry may be observed to dip

boneatli the basaltic rocks of tlie siuTounding country ; and the observations made
here and elsewhere tended to show that of the two kinds of rock the trachytes are

the oldei'.

   On the other hand, both at Carnearny Hill and Scolboa, the trachyte seems to

have been penetrated by "necks" of later date filled with basalt, through which

Wesome portions of the overh-ing basaltic sheets may have been erupted.  are not,

however, as yet in a position to say whether or not the trachyte is the oldest and

lowest of all the tertiary volcanic rocks of coiuity Antrim, as its base is nowhere

exposedt.

The events which have taken place in the volcanic history of this locality appear

to have been as follows :

/ At some early stage of the Miocene period large masses of tracliytic rocks were

poured forth from one or more vents, doubtless accompanied by craters as in

Auvergue. After probably a long interval of repose, new eruptions of basalt and

doleiite took place through fissures and small A"olcaiiic vents breaking through the

trachyte. These later eruptions of basalt may have enveloped the whole of the

tracliytic masses, which liave been subsequently laid bare by denudation. The denu-

dation of this region has been very great during Postpliocene and later times ; and to
it is due the obliteration of the actual craters of eruption over the whole volcanic

region of Antrim.

  --Trachyte Porphyry of co. Doicn. This rock is very similar in appearance and

constitution to that of Antrim, consisting of a greyish felsitic base with crystals of

sanidine and blebs of quartz. It is only visible at JBallyknock, about four miles west

of Hillsborough, surrounded on all sides by Lower Silurian rocks, but not very far

distant from the margin of the basaltic plateau of Antrim. There can be little

   t Mr. Hardman considers that tlie amount of lime .shown by the analysis proves that
the trachyte lias undergone some amount of metamorphosis or alteration, and considers it

probable that it is consequently older than the basalt of Antrim, a view which subsequent
examination in the field has enabled rae to verify. Dr. Bryco thinks the traehyts occupies
the position of the great oclire-beds.

doubt that it is of tlic same age as tlie trachyte porphyry of Antrim, hoth being
referable, iu nil probability, to the great volcanic outbuists of the Miocene period.

   Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the relations of the Dowushire trachyte
to the volcanic rocks of the adjoining country. It only appears in two or three spots
within a small area ; but the probabilities are that it is a portion of an old neck from
which trachytic lava was erupted contemporaneously with that of Antrim. The
higher portion of the nuxss, as well as the original vent, have been removed by
denudation, and the district has since been deeply buried beneath Boulder-clay*.

On tJie liaised Beach of the North-east of Ireland. By Professor Edward Hull,

              F.ll.S., F.G.S., Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland.

   All along the eastern coast of Ireland, from Dublin Bay northward, there are to

be found at intervals distinct evidences that the coast has been raised in recent times.

--These evidences are divisible into two kinds : First, the occurrence of a narrow

fringe of varj'ing elevation, forming a terrace extending for some distance inland
from the coast, and composed of stratified sand and gravel containing marine shells

belonging to species now inhabiting the Irish Sea ; and, secondly, the existence of
old sea-worn dill's forming the inland margin of these terraces, which are now

bej'ond the reach of the highest tides. In the north of Ireland these cliffs are
penetrated by caves which have yielded bones of animals, some of which are extinct

in that part of the country, while the gravels of the old beach contain amongst the
sea-shells worked flints in considerable quantity in county Antrim, which prove

the elevation of the coast to have taken place since the human period.
   The occurrence of the caves near the Giant's Causeway and the island of Rathlin

was long ago noticed by Dr. Bryce and Mr. Andrews t, while the existence of tlint-
implements of human workmanship in the coast gravel of Larne and Belfast Lough

was first brought into notice by the late Mr. CI. V. Du Noj'er J ; but, as far as the

author had ascertained, no one has treated these littoral phenomena as a whole, or
shown that they belong to one period of general elevation along the whole coast-
line, and that they are represented by similar phenomena on the coast of Scotland
and the north of England.

  --Localities. Commencing from the southward, the raised beach may be observed

in several places around Dublin Bay, as along the coast of Ireland's Eye, forming
a well-marked terrace ; below Lowther Lodge, near Balljriggan, and in several
places south of the mouth of the Boyne, the elevation of the terrace varies from (j to

8 feet above high-water mark.
   Along the Downshire coast the gravelly terrace maj' frequently be observed, as

at Cloughy in the Ards, and along the coast at Killough and Ardglass to the south-

ern shores of Belfast Lough. Along this portion of the coast the maximum eleva-
tion is about 12 feet, as determined by Mr. Traill and the author §. On the north side

of the Lough, and around the shores of Larne and Island Magee, the gravel-beach

with shells may be obser\'ed at Bhanbuoy, near Carrickfergus, where its elevation

--is 12 feet at Kilroot, at Lame Harbour, and the eastern shore of Island Magee,
--with shells and M'orked flints and at numerous points along the Antrim coast, such

as the entrance to Glenarift", Red Bay, Bally castle Bay, and Eathlin Island, where
we have examples of old caves, sea-stacks, and shell-gravels reaching to an elevation

of 20 feet above high-water mark.

    It is in consequence of this gradually increasing elevation that the evidence of
the rising of the coast becomes more striking northward; and from the above data

it will be seen that the maxinuim elevation ranges from about feet in Dublin IJay
to 20 feet at the extreme north-eastern point of the Irish coast ; so that by an easy-
transition the elevation falls in with that of the " 2o-feet beach," lirst described 1 y
Mr. Smith, of Jordan Hill, Mr. Maclariu, and more recently by Professor Geikie||.

Similar phenomena are observaUe along the western shores of the British coast.

Along the shores, bays, and headlands of Argjdeshire and Ayrshire we find the

fringe of shelly gravel, the old coast clift", with caves and sea-stacks now high and

dry, at an elevation nearly corresponding with that of the caves, shelly sands, &c.

of the Antrim coast. Southward, towards the shores of the Solway Firth, the

elevation decreases, and this decrease continues till the evidences of a raised beach

almost disappear towards the estuarj^ of the Mersey.

--matter of some interest in the physical geology of these islands.

beaches on both sides of the channel is the occurrence of works of human art im-

bedded in undisturbed strata along with marine shells. Mr. Geikie mentions that

thirty canoes have been dug out of the 2o-feet terrace along the estuary of the

Clyde. Along the Irish coast the abundance of worked Hints testify, as Mr. Dii

Noj'er has shown, to the presence of man along these shores when they were to a

greater degree than at present under water. These flints have also been observed

in the gravels of the coast of Dowushire, as well as in spots in the interior, and at a

--considerable elevation above the sea, imbedded in the soil.

A few Memavl-s on Submarine Explorations, with reference to M. Delesse^sworh

  'entitled " LitJiologle dufond des Mers." By J. "Gwtn Jeffreys, F.B.S.

The Utlioloo-y of the sea-bottom is not only a vast subject in its various rehations to

natural history and physical science, but i's especially interesting in a geological

Eoint of view.'because every part of our globe has been at one time or another covered
 y the sea. Mr. Jeftreys contended that it is almost impossible to ascertain, with any

degree of certainty, what stratified formations are marine unless we find in them

such remains of marine animals as were capable of being preserved. Exceptions

doubtless occur, r. where the stratum had been subject to the action of carbonic
                                                               f/.

acid, produced by the subsequent passage of rain or fresh water; in which case all

calcareous organisms might have been dissolved before they became silieitied or

petrified. He then gave a short account of submarine explorations from the time
when 0. F. MiLller first used a dredge for scientific purposes (about 1772) to the

present day ; and he summarized tlie results of the expeditious conducted by his
colleagues and himself on board II.M.S. ' Porcupine,' under the auspices of tho
Royal Society in 18(39 and 1870. But next to nothing is knovm of the enormous

tracts of sea-bed which underlie the depths of the ocean in both hemispheres. He

attributed the diflusion and geographical distribution of the marine Invertebrate

fauna to the action of currents, and not to voluntary migration.
   M. Delesse's work was recently published at Paris, and consists of two octavo

volumes, besides an atlas of charts and maps. The precise date of publication does

not appear the dedication is dated 1st December, 1871. It forms part of a series

While giving M. Delesse full credit for the laborious and conscientious manner in

which he has e^idently performed his great task, Mr. Jefireys regretted that he had

omitted to notice the reports on deep-sea explorations published by the Iloyal

Society in 18G9 and 1870, or the address of Mr. Prestwich (the late President of

the Geological Society), which was published in May 1871, and particularly treated
of those Ileports. M. Delesse is a foreign member of the Geological Society. By

consulting what had been published on the subject, M. Delesse would have been able

not only to give fuller information, but to correct errors which unavoidably occur in

an extensive compilation. For instance, his map of France during the Tertiary
epoch does not show the communication which has been proved by naturalists
and geologists to have then existed between the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of
Lyons. According to M. Delesse, there has been no communication since the

L:assic period betv.'een the Atlantic and the Mediterranean north ofthe Pyrenees.

His division of the French marine fauna into three provinces (Celtic, Lusitauian,
and Mediterranean) does not agree with modern observations. Zoophagous mol-

lusca do  not, as  stated  by him, live  on  those which  are  phytophagous                                                          pebbles

(" galets ") are not everywhere unfavourable to mollusca, even on coasts exposed

to a stormy sea; find Foraminifera never crawl at the bottom of the sea. But it is

to be hoped that these omissions and errors will be rectified in another edition of a

work so desirable and important to scientific inquirers.

Notice of Veins or Fissures in ilie Kevper, filed ivith Elicdichonc-lcd, at Gold-

                  ciiffe in Monmouthshire. By J. E. Lee, F.G.S.

   The alluvial plain stretcbiDg along the south of Monmouthshire, on the banks of
the Bristol Channel, is hroken in one or two places b_y liassic outliers, one of which
forms the rising ground of Goldclitle. The upper part of this outlier consists of
Lower Lias and of t\ie " Anmicnifes-platwi-his beds." The strata immediately
below are concealed by a high sea-wall, built on the Keuper Marls, which form a scar
at low water. On this scar are many serpentine projections of various lengths and
sizes. Some of them are 21 feet long, and a foot or even 18 inches wide. In some
cases one appears to run under the other, and many of them are rounded, both
above and below ; not caused b}' the action of the present sea, but having been
originally of this form, for these rounded portions are covered by the original
Keuper Marl. They all consist of liassic bone-bed, Avith scales of GyroJepis and
teeth oi Ilyhodus and Saurichthys. It is presvnned that these projections are the casts
in the bone-bed of fissures made in the Keuper before the bone-bed was deposited,
which would then immediately fill them. The roundness of many of these pro-
jections is endeavoured to be accounted for by supposing these fissures to have
been formed, either wholly or partially, as in the present day on clay-scars, by riUa

of running water on the marls previously to the deposit of the bone-bed.

On the Occurrence of Copper- and Lead-ores in the Bunter Conglomerates of

                Cannoch Chase. By William Molynetjx, F.G.S.

The author first staled that the district known as Cannock Chase was at the pre-

sent moment the scene of a series of extensive mining-operations, which, if even

moderately successful, would open up a very consideiablo area of A-aluable coal-

scams, computed at not less than 200,000,000 tons, and push outwards a distance

of upwards of five miles the northern apex of the South-Staffordshire coal-field.

This apex, as is well known, rested on Brereton, where the Coal-measures are

thrown down on the east by a fault of consideralile range and influence, and on the

west they are o^'erlappecl uncomfonnablj' by Bunter conglomerates. From Brereton

the conglomerates continue uorlhward over the Chase, which extends to within

about four miles of the town of Stafford, up to which point the mining investiga-

tions alluded to will be carried.

The Cannock Mineral Eailway from Cannock to Rugeley occupies a valley

which runs nearlj' nortli and south, and unquestionably marks a line of fault of con-

siderable importance. This fault is laid down in the maps of the Geological Survey,

and has long been held as determining the western boundary-line of the workable

coal-seams of South Staflbrdshire. AVest of this valley, from a point a little south

of the town of Cannock, as far as Broctou and Milford, ranges the old surface-area

of a large portion of Cannock Chase, the greater part of which is at the present

time in a state of nature. In the maps of the Geological Survey, this area, with

but a trilling exception, is laid down as Bunter pebble-beds, overspread by uncon-

solidated  conglomerates  of the   New  Red  Sandstone                                           <ind  it was  in these beds,  at  a

place called Shore Hill, about a mile north of the town of Cannock, that the author

first detected, about two years ago, the copper- and lead-ore to which the paper
referred. The conglomerates are liere exposed by a section of from 80 to 100 feet,

and they dip to the west at an angle of about 20°. They consist of the ordinary

groups of pebbles and irregular intersections of sandy roclv ; and at about the

middle of the section occurs the copper-ore in the form of a green carbonate, in-

termixed with tlie paste or cementing material in which the pebbles are set. The

ore does not occupy any definite position in the gravels, nor is it confined to any par-

ticular horizon. It is sometimes met with in little holes left by the decomposition of

Carboniferous limestone or chert-pebbles : it frequently coats and even occasionally

insinuates itself into the interior of minutely fractured pebbles, and in places occurs

iu quantities which, if proportiouatcly persistent, would be of great commercial

vahie. At this pit the copper-ores, so far as the author had found, were not directly

associated with lead ; but about 20 I'cct beneath the copper-bearing beds, the hitter

ore is f jund to occur in a series of thin cementing lines in the gravels, and folio-w-

ing tl>e natural inclination of the beds. In one instance the gravels are set in a

ligh' grey and greenish-yellow cement, in which occur tiaces of lead, iron, and

abuninium soluble in acids. It is therefore to these conditions, namely the ad-

r.iixture of copper- and lead-ores with the Huntington gravels, that they owe their

/peculiar character as detrimental to the growth of weeds, and from whicli, but

previously unknown, circumstance they have a large demand as material for the

formation and repair of private roads and walks, the gravel ha\ing been sent so far

as Ireland for this purpose.

During the early part of the present year the Fair Oak Colliery Company com-

menced sinking a pair of shafts for coal 4 miles to the north-east of the Hunt-

ington gravel-pits, about 2A miles north of the West Caimoek Colliery, half

a mile west of the assured boundary fault, and about 2 miles west of the
Brereton Collieries. The sinkings commence in drift sands and gravel, and are

succeeded by I3unter conglomerates. At a depth of 29 feet from the surface

lead-ore occurs in large quantities, disseminated ireely amongst the gravels,

which are coarse, and set in an excessively hard calcareous cement. The ore is, how-
ever, hj no means continuous or persistent in its occurrence, but is found at irre-

gular intervals in larger or smaller quantities, mixed up both with fine and

coarse gravel, downwards to a depth of 85 feet from the surface. At 75 feet in the

shaft copper-ore first shows itself, and is in this case distinctly separated from the

lead. In passing further downwards, however, both these ores are found freel}' asso-

ciated together and in large quantities; but the former, so far, by no means reaches

the percentage of the Huntington specimens. In this particular instance (that is,
the association of the two ores) the Fair-Oak ores difier from those of Huntington,

although it is of course quite probable that this may not be so in ground at present

unexplored. The Fair-Oak ore consists of a green carbonate, occasionally passing

into malachite, or carbonate and hydrate of copper; and there are also in some spe-
cimens traces of oxide of copper. The lead, which individually is more abundant

than at Huntington, occurs in the form of ordinary galena or sulphide of lead but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

so far no other ores, except manganese and iron, have been detected, although it is

most probable that both cobalt and nickel, and possiblj^ tin, may exist in^ small

quantities.

With regard to the origin of these ores, or under what condition they were pro-

duced, the author would not venture an opinion                                                                                                                                                                                                                      but  he believed  that  they would

at these particular and widely separated points was certainly curious and worthy

Howof investigation.  far tliej^ extended downwards in the gravels would be ascer-

tained by the sinkings, but they had not hitherto been met with below 108 feet
from the surface. The author concluded by observing that he believed this was the
only known instance of the occurrence of copper- and lead-ores in undoubted Bunter

conglomerates in England.

two from the Middle Lias. The little wheel-like plates, which are about the fortieth
of an inch in diameter, belong- to Chirodota, and present considerable variety in form,
some of them indicating structure not hitherto seen in recent species. They are
formed of a number of minute wheel-spokes, varying' from five to thirteen, which
start from a central axis and are surrounded on the outside by a wheel-tire ; on
the inner edge of some species are a series of very minute teeth extending over
the central cavity. One of the prettiest forms is from the Inferior Oolite, which
the author did himself the honour to name Chirodota Carpenteri, after the President
of the Association, who had done so much for microscopic science. In this species
the wheel-tire was divided into a number of sections, giving- it a very ornate
appearance. The author concluded by expressing a hope that this interesting class

of animals would receive a more systematic study than had hitherto been given to

them.

On the Geolorpj of the Tlmnder Bay and Shahendowan Mining-Districts, on

   the NorlJi Shore of Lake /S'((j)2)'/or. Bif H. Alleyne Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc,
   F.B.S.E., F.G.S., Professor of Natural History in University Colleye,

    Toronto.

In this communication the author gave a short account of the leading geological

features of the mining-districts of Thunder Bay and Lake Shabendowan, on the

north shore of Lake Superior. After giving an account of the chief points of

interest in the physical structure of Thunder Bay, it was shown that the chief

metalliferous veins of this region are situated in the group of rocks which are

known to Canadian geologists as the " Lower Copper-bearing series." The litho-

logical characters of this series were briefly described, and it was shown that the

age of the group is probably Lower Silurian. Finally, the author described the

leading lodes of the district, and pointed out that it was likely to become one of

the richest silver-bearing regions in the North-American continent.

The Lake Superior gold-districts are situated round Lake Shabendowan and to

the N.E. of this, and occupy a lai-ge area of country which is placed about sixty

miles from Thunder Ba}', and is reached by"the " lied lliver ronte." The geology

of the country intervening between Thunder Bay and Lake Shabendowan was

briefly described ; and it was shown that the auriferous veins intersect a vast series

of Iluronian slates. These slates are for the most part greenish grey in colour,

Eometimes fine-grained, sometimes brecciated, and often glossy and soapy from

the presence in them of talc. The slates are interstratified with beds of trap ; and
the author drew especial attention to the exceedingly close resemblance which they

present to the so-called " Green Slates and Porphyries " of the Lake-district of the

--Korth of England a resemblance which is shown, not only in the mineral nature

of the rocks, but in the kind of scenery produced by their weathei-ing. The author

also expressed I'.is opinion that these Iluronian slates, though generally spoken of

simply as " talcoso slates," are truly of the nature of bedded felspathic ashes, and

that the talc which they contain is a secondary product developed in them by me-

tamorphic action subsequent to their original formation. The gold-bearing veins,

finally, were shown to have generally an E. and W. or E.N.E. and W.S.W. direc-

tion,  conforming  to  the  strilie  of the  rocks  which  thej' traverse                                                             and the  ores which
                                                                                                                                   ;

they contain were shown to be chiefly auriferous copper-pyrites and free gold, with

the occasional occurrence of galena, silver-glance, metallic silver, and iron-

pyrites.

On Ortonia, a neiv Genus of Fossil Tuhicolar Annelides, with Notes on the

   Genus Tentaculites. By H. Alletne jSTicholson, M.D., D.Sc, F.B.S.E.,

    Professor of Naturcd History in University Colleye, Toronto.

   Having carefully examined numerous examples of the genus Tentaculites, Sclilot.,
the author had arrived at the opinion that fossils of very different zoological affini-
                               --;

ties had been included under this head. The genu3 TentacriUtcs is truly referable
to the Pteropoda, and therefore all the forms which belonj^ here must necessarily
ba free and unattached to foreiga objects, since an attached or parasitic Pteropod
is not conceivable. Similarly all the forms of TentacuUtei proper must possess a

straight shell, since the shell of the Pteropods is always either straight or regularly

curved. No irregularly twisted and contorted tubes can, therefore, be properly

referred to Teiitaculites.

   In accordance with these principles, the author formerly established the genus

ConchicoUtes, to include Tubicolar Annelides the tubes of which are attached
socially in clustered masses to dead shells (American Journ. of Science and Arts,

vol. iii. No. 15, 1872). The author now proposed a second geaus, under the name
of Ortonia, after its discoverer, Mr. Edward Orton, of Ohio, to include certain other
Tubicolar Annelides which had been previously referred to TeiitacidUes. The genus

Ortonia comprises the single species O. coiiica, vrhich is doubtfully identitied with

the Tentaculites Jlexuosa of Hall. The only known species is from the Lower
Silurian (Caradoc) of North America, occurring in the rocks of the " Cincinnati

--Group " (Hudson-River series) of Ohio. The following diagnosis gives the

characters of the genus .and species :

   Ortonia, Nich. Animal solitary, inhabiting a calcareous tube, which is
attached along the whole of one side to some foreign body. Tube slightly liexuous,
conical, in section cylindrical or subtriangular. Walls of the tube thick, cellular
along the margin opposite to the attached siuface, and markedly annulated by

transverse ridges or i-ings along the sides.

    Ortonia conica, Nich. Tubes growing attached to the shell of some nioUusk

^varying in length from \ to | an inch, with a diameter of about of an inch at

the mouth. Lateral annulations of the tube varj-ing in number from 30 to 35 in
the space of an inch. Surface smooth and completely destitute, so far as observed,

of longoitudinal stri?e.

   Notes on Maehairodus latidens found hy the Rev. J. MacEncrv in Kent's

                   Cavern, Torquaij. B>j ^Y. Pengelly, F.B.S., F.G.S.

   In this communicati\On the author discussed the following questions:
   1st. Did Mr. MacEnery find more than five canines of 31achairodus latidem in the
Cavern ?
   2nd. Did he find there more than one incisor of this species ?
   3rd. To what era did the Kent's Hole Maehairodus belorg?
   1. Having pointed out that in his " Cavern Researches " MacEnery mentioned no
more than five canines, all of which had been traced, and explained that it had been
inferred from certiiin expressions in documents preserved by the Yorkshire Philoso-
phical Society that a sixth canine, found in the Cavern, had been presented by

MacEner}- to the Museum in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, the author stated that he

of Maehairodus, whence it has been inferred that two incisors were found by
had recently visited the Museum for the purpose of investigating the question, and
had found that plaster casts of a canine, and not an .actual tooth, had formed part of
MacEnery's present to Cuvier.

   2. Proceeding to the .second question, he called attention to a plate, in Indian

ink, the property formerly of Mr. MacEnerj', but now of the Torquay Natural-
History Society. It contains five figures, three of them representing two incisors
MacEnery. In reply, it was pointed out that MacEnery mentions but one incisor,
tliat there was no evidence that the figures represented Kent's Cavern specimens,

that the plate certainly did not belong to the Cavern series, aaid was never referred
to in MacEnery's manuscripts.

   3. On the third and most important question (the era of the Cavern 3Iachairo-

dus) it was shown, from MacEnery's statements, that the canines and incisor
were f<)und in a branch of Kent's Hole kno^vn as the Wolf's Cave, mixed with re-

--mains of the ordinary cave mammals (Rhinoceros, Elephant, Horse, Ox, Elk, Deer,

Hyaena, Bear, Wolf, and Fox) that though of delicate .structure, they, unlike some

--of the specimens found with them, bore no indications of contusion or abrasion and
          --

--that their fangs had been gnawed. To this it had been objected that the Cavern con-

tained two ossiferous deposits one, termed "Breccia," found only iu certain
branches, the other, known as " Cave-earth," much more widely spread and of less

--atitiquity that fragments of the former were in certain localities found incorporated
--in the latter that in all probability fossils had been occasionally washed out of the
--Breccia and redeposited in the Cave-earth and that the following was the problem
--to be solved : \\'as not tliis the history of the remains of Mucluiirodus found in

Kent's Hole ? In reply, the author stated that whilst the Breccia teemed with
fossils, they were the remains of bears only, that Ihey were in a diiferent mineral

--condition from those found in the Cave-earth, and that the teeth of 3Iachairo(h(s

were in this respect identical with the latter that whilst the fangs of the Ma-

cJiairodus-teeth. were certainly gnawed, there were in the Breccia no indications of
the hy»na, to which the work was no doubt to be ascribed (none of his teeth, or

--his coprolites, or bones gnawed by him) ; but in the Cave-earth his remains were

more abundant than those of any other animal that in the Wolf's Cave there were

--no traces of the Ijreccia, either in sitir, or in incorporiited fragments and that the

absence of marks of contusion or abrasion was incompatible witli the hypothesis
of dislodgement and re-deposition.

   The paper concluded with the following expression of opinion on the three

questions discussed :

   1st. There is no reason for believing or suspecting that more than five canines
were found by Mr. MacEnerv.

   2nd. The evidence that more than one incisor was found by Mr. MacEnery is not

conclusive.

   f!rd. Machairodus latidens belonged to the era of the Cave-earth of Kent's Cavern.
There is at present no evidence that it belonged to the earlier period represented by
the "Breccia; " and should such evidence present itself hereafter, it will simply
prove that, li]:e Ursns spchcus, Machairodus belonged to both eras.

   P.S. Since this paper was ^vlitten, a fine incisor of Mac/iairodiis latidens has been
found in Kent's Cavern, by the Committee appointed b}' tlie British Association to
explore the Cavern. It lay with the left lower jaw of bear in the uppermost foot-
level of the Cave-earth, and had teeth of hyajna, bear, and horse verticallj' below

it, thus confirming tlie conclusion already arrived at respecting its era.

On a remarlahh Block of Lava ejected hy Vesuvius at the Great Eruption,

   April 1872, irhich proves tlie formation of Silicates throitcjli Sublimation.

  Bu Herr G. vost Eath, Bonn.

  The aggregates rich in minerals found in the strata of tuff on Monte di Somma

are known to all mineralogists. Most of these magnificent mineral aggregates are
no longer ejected by tlie volcano of to-day; but even now fragments of ancient
lava are to be found amongst the projectiles of the volcano, distinguished by larger
crystals of leucite than those in the more recent lava-streams and in the

scorite.

It is of high geological interest to examine such evidence as may allow of newly

formed minerals being recognized. Thus the ordinary lava, with its manifold mix-

tures of minerals and the delicate crystals in its cavities, cannot be the product of a

simple cooling. Some of the crystals found in the lava were already in existence pre-

viously and were swimming in tlie stream, while some were crystallizing out of the

her}- mass during the progress of its solidification ; and, lastly, certain crystals appear-

ing in cavities indicate the cooperation of vapour which had been active in the igne-

ous magma. The distinction of the various formations of minerals is exceedingly

difficult in the ordinary lava and scoriaj, as in the flowing and cooling lava different

Amineralogical processes may combine.  more fiivoural:ile condition for observa-

tion is presented when a mass of ancient lava has been subjected again to volcanic
activity, and has served partly ns a substratum, partly as the base for new minera-

logical formations. It is easier by far to distinguish such newly formed crystals

accurately from the original lava in the blocks c'jected than in the ordinary lava.

The study of such matters is conducting us to the view that the quantities of

water, liydrocliloric acid, sulphuric acid, &c. exhaled bj' the er<ater3 and by the
streams of lava are not only an acconipanying phenomenon in the production of
volcanic rocks and mineral ag-gregates, but that they are essentially cooperating

agents in their origination. If once we succeed in proving and explaining the

origin of minerals through vapours, or by cooperation of vapours, then will the key

to many a problem relating to the plutouic rocks and their mineral veins be

found.

  A block of lava ejected by Vesuvius in its last eruption is very instructive, as

throwing light on the formation of minerals by volcanic \'apours. This block
shows that in its interior small and fine crystals of pyroxene, mica, sodalite, ha3ma-
tite (specular iron), and magnetite were formed, whiht at the same time in the peri-
pheric zone the pyroxene was melting and the leucite being destroyed by the vol-

canic heat.

   Originally our block of lava had doubtless the appearance of so many varieties of
lav'a from the dykes of the Somma. The character of the "lava antica " is well
known to those acquainted with Vesuvius. The original nature of our rock is in-
dicated by thickly agglomerated leucite of sizes up to 3 millims. (scarce), green
pyroxene as large as 5 millims., and a magma with a great many cavities. Our frag-
ment shows the constitution of the outside as well as of the interior. It is enclosed

in a covering of black lava a few millims. thick, which is full of bladders on the sur-
face, towards the interior dense and melted like obsidian. In this crust it is clear
that some parts of the ancient lava, for instance the pyroxene, were melted with
the new lava, in the midst of which our block was floating in the depths of the
crater before the eruption. Though in the periplieric zone there is nothing to be
scon of pyroxene, the lencite-crystals have oeen destroyed, but not melted ; they

rise out of the black scoriaceous matter as white grains soaked through, as it were,
by the grey melted mass. To this external zone another succeeds, lO-lo millims. in

thickness, in which the rock is firm and compact, find nothing is to be seen of new
mineral formations. At this zone the pyroxene-crystals are likewise melted, and the

 cavities of the rock are filled with the melted mass penetrating from the outside.

How could the htematite have been formed so as to escape being fused down with the

igneous silicate ? At a distance of 12-15 millims. from the periphery the pyroxene
 is not melted, at least not totally, to glassy drops ; and it is here that, naturally
 without distinct limits, the inner part of the block commences in which the new
 formations have taken place. The cavities here are not filled with a melted mass,
 but covered with small delicate crystals that sparkle brightly and are in marked
 contrast with the dense melted magma of the peripheric zone. The sparkling

 covering of the little geodes consists principally of hrematite and reddish-yellow
 pyroxene. In some cavities the sparkling is due to plates of ha?matite, in others
 nearly entirely to reddish -yellow pyroxene. Most of them show both minerals
 together and in intimate mixture. Both minerals, haematite and pj'roxene,

 appear not only in the cavities, but also in the smallest fissures and holes of the
 general mass, and even of the leucite. Studied by a lens, the rock is seen every-
 where to exhibit minute shining points of black hajmatite and red pyroxene. The

 little pyroxene-crystals, appearing here as new formations, resemble in colour and
 hal)it exactly those crystals which seven years ago I found implanted on the

 volcanic hrematite of the spent fumarole in a scoriaceous hill near our lake of
 Laach, and which I announced as the first decided proof of a silicate originated by
 sublimation. Magnetite in small quantities, but in the same circumstances as

 pyroxene, is also found in our rock. By close observation of the little cavities one
 may also observe a fourth mineral in white crystals of pearly lustre, formed like-

 wise by sublimation. It was somewhat difficult to determine that mineral ; it has,
 however, been done with great certainty : it is sodalite,

    The formation of haematite by volcanic snblimalion, formerly a riddle, is now
 quite understood ; but the chemical process, how silicates are formed by sublima-

 tion, is not as clearly understood even now. Chemistry will succeed in explaining
 this geological fact, as it has done with the A'olcanic haematite.

    Even now we can settle with precision that M\ater and chloride of sodium effect

 principally the origin of silicates bj' sublimation, as is the case with the volcanic

 hfematite. Certainly it is not accid(;ntally that we find sodalite, the silicate most

rich in sodium, to he sublimated by Tolcauic processes. The chloride of sodium

derived from the sea is separated bj^ the chemical actions of the volcano. Chlorine
unites with hydrogen, iron, &c. ; sodium plays its part in the formation of sodalite.
Sea-water is the great source of volcanic phenomena, as well in the mechanical as
in the chemical point of view. Steam raises the melted matter upwards to the

border of the crater; steam and sodium operating on the !lava originate new
minerals. So sublimations will solve many problems in regard to new and ancient
mineral formations, not to be explained either by supposing a merely aqueous pro-

cess, nor by crystallization out of a molten iluid.
   Twenty j'ears ago Prof. Scacchi of Naples did suggest the sublimation of silicates

at Vesuvius, without producing sufficient proofs to secure belief in this seemingly

incredible fact. The pyroxenes implanted on the volcanic h;ematite in the neigh-

bourhood of our lake of Laach, and the matter ejected by Vesuvius during the
last eruption, place this remarkable fact beyond doubt.

On the Coal- and Iron-Mines of the Arlgna District of the Connaufjht Coal-
                  measures, Ireland, By T. A. Eeauwin, F.G.S.

   The author first gave a sketch of previous writings upon this district, and
acknowledged his indebtedness to the Geological Survey of Ireland for assistance

in his researches.

   The shales overlying the Upper Limestones of the district wqre surmised by the
author to belong to the Yoredale series. Over these there are grits and shales, with
three seams of coal, which the author referred to the Gauuister series, remarking
that a bed of true " gannister " occurred there.

   The coal-field was divided into three districts by the author, each of wliich Vv as

separately described. He noticed at some length the clay, ironstone bands, and
nodules, which occur over a much larger area than do the coals. The ironstone is

richer and purer than most of the English clay-ironstone.
   The coals contained an average of 77 per cent, of carbon, and the limestone an

average of 40 per cent, of metallic iron.
   The author believed that the time had come for a vigorous and scientific explo-

ration of the district, which he felt convinced w^ould soon become, ns Sir R. Kane
had long ago predicted, " an important centre of industry Cor the interior of the

country."

   The author stated that this paper was submitted to the Section with the view of
giving some information as to an experiment just being commenced to explore, by
boring, the rocks imderlying the Weald of Sussex, especially to reach and

ascertain the nature of the paleozoic rocks. This undertaking has been planned
by Mr. Henry Willett, in honour of the visit of the Association to Brighton.

   The author first described the general structure of the Weald, illustrating his
remarks by reference to the roclis exposed along the Loudon and Brighton Raihvay.
The lines of disturbance traversing this area were also described ; and particular
reference was made to the lowest known beds of the district (the Ashburnliain beds),
which are brought up to view by the main anticlinal on the north of Brightling.
The ascertained thickness of these Ashburnhnm beds was slated to be about 350
feet, and the lowe.'-t known beds were shown to lie close to the surface in Eounden
Wood; near Brightling.

The author then passed on to describe the range of the ohler roelcs, with tlieir

associated Coal-measures, from the south of IreLind, throug-h the west of Eiiolaiid,

ami theu again in Belgium. Following the reasoning of "Mr. Godwin-Austen, as

laid before the Geological Society in 1855, the author showed that a ridge of pahco-

zoic rocks must extend under the south-east of England, and that such liad been

certainly reached at Harwich, possibly also at Kentish Town. The likelihood of

the occurrence of Coal-measures along this line was also discussed.

It was shown that in the Boulonnais the Carboniferous Limestone, where last seen,

is dipping south                                                               and that in the Pays de Bray, near Gournaj', Carboniferous Lime-
                                                                            ;

stone has been found at a depth of only 22 metres below Kimmeridge claj^ From

these facts it seems extremely likely that a trough of Coal-measures may lie between

these two points ; and if so, this trough will probably be continued westwards under

the Weald. But of this, and even of tlie character' of the Coal-measures if found,

there must necessarily be great uncertainty. Tlie sub-Wealden boring may not at

once determine these points, but it will give important data towards the future de-

termination of them. With regard to the thickness of the rocks to be passed

through, nothing certain could be said. The author, as the result of a careful exa-

mination of the evidence, concluded that IGOO feet would probably be the maximum

depth to the pala3ozoic rocks. Mr. Prestwich, as the result of other inquiries, had

suggested 1700 feet as the maximum depth. These results, independently arrived

at, gave great hopes that the numbers named would not be exceeded. The minimum

depth could scarcely be less than UOO or 700 feet.

 _ With regard to t^ie site selected for the boring, it was shown that it was on'tlie
Inie of the main anticlinal, and within about 100 feet of the lowest known part of
tlie Ashburnham beds, and consequently in a most favourable spot for this experi-

ment.

deputation of the Council had waited on Mr. Forster, to urge the importance of
the introduction of natural science into the elementary schools also of the couutry.
The Government had distinctly abandoned the principle that primary education
should be confined to reading, writing, and arithmetic ; but little had been effected
as yet for the practical introduction of scientific instruction. The experience of
Dean Dawes and Prof. Henslow had conclusively shown the aptitude of the
children for such instruction; and he rejoiced to see that the School Boards of
London and Liverpool had determined on the introduction of elementary science
into all schools under their control. If it was objected that this could only

amount to a smattering, it might well be asked, who has more ? Those who are
most advanced in knowledge know best how slight this knowledge is._ Indeed
every, fresh observation opens up new lines of inquiry. Every biologist would

admit the impulse to research which had been given by the publication of Mr.

Darwin's ' Origin of Species.' Yet it was surprising how much fundamental mis-

apprehension still surrounds Mr. Darwin's views. Tlius Browning, in one of his

most recent poems, said :

                            That mass man sprung from was a jelly lump

                                Once on a time ; he kept an after course

                                Tliroiigh fisli and insect, reptile, bird, or beast,

                               Or last but one.

It was hardly necessary to point out that i^ir. Darwin would be the first to repu-

diate such a'tlieory. These types of structure might be derived from one origin ;

mthey were certainly not links "in one sequence. It was one thing to recognize

natural  selection  a vera  causa                            it was  another  to  assume  that  all  animals were
                                                          ;

descended from one primordial source. As to the first alternative, he could not

himself feel any doubt ; and whatever conclusion might be come to as to the

latter, the publication of the ' Origin of Species ' would not the less have consti-

Howtuted an epoch in biology.                                far the present condition of living beings was due

to natural selection,--how far, on the other hand, the action of natural selection

has been modified or checked by other natural laws, by the uualterability of types,
by atavism, &c.,--how many types originally came into being, whether they had
arisen simultaneously or successively,--these and many other similar questions

remained to be solved, even if we admitted the theory of natural selection. All
this, indeed, had been clearly pointed out by Mr. Darwin himself, and would not
have needed repetition but for the careless criticism by whidi, in too many cases,
the true question had been obscured. AVithout, however, discussing the argument

for and against ]\Ir. Darwin's conclusion, we so often meet with travesties of it lilce

that which he had quoted, that it might be worth while to consider the stages
through which some one group (say that of insects) had come to be what they

were,'assuming them to have developed from simpler organisms under the influence

of natural laws. The question was one of great difficulty. It was hardly neces-
sary to say that they cannot have passed through all the forms of animal life, and
the true line of development would not be agreed upon by all naturalists. Almost
every one would, however, admit that embryology and development were our
best o-nides. The various groups of Crustacea, for instance, however different
tlie mature conditions, were for the most part very similar when they quitted

the e*^'"*.
   So^ao-ain, in the case of insects; the dilferenccs between the different groups of

insects were indeed great. The stag-beetle, the dragonfly, the moth, the bee, the
ant, the gnat, the grasshopper ; these, and other less familiar types, seemed at first

mto have little indeed in common. They differed in size, in form, in colour,

habits, and modes of life yet, following the clue of the illustrious Saviguy, it had
                                                                                                                                       ;

been shown, not only that they were constructed on one common plan, but that
other groups, such as Crustacea and Araclmida, could be shown to be fundamentally

similar. If we compared the larviB, this fact became mucli more evident. It had

been pointed out by Brauer and also by himself that the two tj-pes of larvaj which

Packard had proposed to call tlie eruciform and leptiforui ran through tlie principal

groups of insects. This was obviously a fact of great importance. If individual beetles

were derived from a form very similar to that of the existing- genus Ccmipodea, it

was surelj' no rash h^'pothesis to suggest that the Coleoptera as a group might be

so. If he were aslced to describe the insect type, he would say it was an animal

composed of head with mouth-parts, eyes, and antennae, a tliorax made ;ip of three

segments, each Avitli a pair of legs, and a many-.=egniented abdomen with anal

appendages. This, for instance, would describe the larva of a small beetle named

Sitaris ; and, speaking generally, it might be said that (excepting the weevils)
Coleoptera generally were derived from larvre of this type. The same was also

true of Neuroptera, Orthoptera, and Trichoptera. The larva> of Lepidoptera, from

the large size of tlie^abdomen, had been generallj', and, as he thought, wrongly,

classed with the maggots of tiies, bees, &c. The three thoracic segments were,

on the contrary, marked bj^ legs, and, excepting gi'eater clumsiness in general

appearance, they essentiallj'- agreed with the type already described. No Dipterous

larvffi belonged, however, to this type. Insects, then, widely diflerent in their

mature state closely agreed in their larval states. Was there any mature form

Wewhich also corresponded to the hexapod larvfe of insects ?  need not have

been surprised if this tj^pe, through wliich it would appear that insects must have

passed so many ages since (for winged Neuroptera have been found in carboniferous

strata), had long ago become extinct. But the genus Campodea still represented

it. It seemed to him also highly significant that its mouth -parts were intermediate

between the haustellate and maudibulate types. There were good grounds, there-

fore, for considering the various types of insects to have descended from ancestors

more or less resembling the genus Campodea.

This ancient t3'pe may have been possibly derived from one less highly developed,

resembling the modern Tardigrades, such as Macrohiotus. Further still, such

genera as Lindia close!}' resembled the vermiform type of larva general in Uiptera

and occurring in other groups. There was reason to think that amongst insects

the segments preceded the appendages in appearance, which was the reverse of

what was the case in Crustacea, although this stage of development might have

eluded observation from its trausitoriness. Fritz Miiller and others considered the

vermiform type of larva more recent than the hexapod. Considering, however,

that the vermiform type was altogether lower in organization and less differentiated

than the Campodea (hexapod) form, he considered that the latter was derived from

vermiform ancestors; and Nicolas Wagner had shown, in the case of a small gnat

allied to Cccidonujia, that these vermiform larvte still, in sonie cases, retain reproduc-

tive powers. Such a lar\a very closely resembled some of the Rotatoria, such as

Lindia, in which both cilia and legs were altogether absent. lie agreed with

Herbert Spencer in regarding this vermiform tj^pe as the result of a modified

segmentation. For the next descending stage we must loolc amongst the Infusoria.

Other forms of Rotatoria, such as the very remarkable Fedalion discovered last

year by Mr. Hudson, seemed to lead to Crustacea through the KanpHiis form.

(The ti'ue worms appeared to constitute a separate branch of the animal kingdom.)

Probably, again, in some such forms as Hackel's Mayosphcera and Protamccba,

the primitive ancestors of even such lowly organized types as 3Iacrobiotiis and

Lindia must be looked for. And if it were said to be incredible that even the

lapse of geological time should have been sufiicient to bridge over the immense

interval between such creatures as these and Campodea, or even the Tardigrades,

we might consider what happened under our eyes in tlie development of each one

of these creatures in the proverbially short space of an insect's individual life. Tlie

de^·elopraent of the egg of a Tardigrade went through the same course as the

Maffosphcvra ; and from the cells which were the result of the process of yolk-
segmentation, the body of the Tardigrade vras built np. Similar processes occurred

in tlie development of many other species belonging to most distinct groups.

Yolk-segmentation occurred in Entozoa, in Rotifera, Ecliinodermata, Mollusca, and

Vertebrata, as was illustrated by the diagrams which were shown. It was true

that yolk-segmentation was not universal in the animal ; kingdom but its absence

miglit he attributed to tliat suppression of stages of embiyological development

·which might be illustrated from many cases both in zoology and in botany.
    Of course it might be argued that these facts have not really the significance

which to him they seemed to possess. It might be said that when the Divine
power created insects they were created with these remarkable developmental
processes. So it had been said that when God created the rocks he created the
fossils in them. Probably no one would now maintain such a theory and he

believed the time would come when the contents of the egg and its developmental
changes would be held to teach as truly the course of organic development in

ancient times as the contents of the rocks told us the past history of the earth

itself.

   In conclusion, there was one matter which he could not but touch upon, but
which he yet could not properly treat at length. Great anxiety had been felt

during the last few months lest changes should be made at Kew which would

prove prejudicial to its scientific work, and lead to the retirement of Dr. Hooker.

He felt sure that he only expressed the feeling of the scientific world when he

said that such an event would be a misfortune to science, and when he stated his
hope that the Government would do nothing to retard or impede the valuable
scientific work now going on at Kew.

In the investigation of a large series of sections of fossil plants, prepared by 3Ir.

Norman, Mr. Carruthers had detected several spherical spiniferous bodies not

unlike Xanthidia, but having a very different structure and a much greater size.

The hollow globular cavity is included in a clearly defined structure, which Mr.

Carruthers thinks is a fenestrated shell ; but he had' not been able to .secure sections

which completely established this point. Beyond this there is a considerable

thickness of a spongy substance which rises externally into numerous cones, the

bases of which are in close proximity. From the apex of each cone there proceeds

a hollow echinate sjnne. The echinations are also hollow; and at the apparent

base of the spine these echinations are produced into hollow tubes, which, repeatedly

branching and anastomosing and increasing in number downwards, enclose the

radial hollow spine in the mass. The whole an-angement of the parts agreed

with what is found in some existing forms of Radiolarians, especially in some with

solid spines                                                         but the  hollow structure of these organs in the fossil indicated rela-

central capsule may have left traces behind in some specimens. Ehizopods of the

Radiolarian type, but without the central capsule, had been described by Cien-

may at last be placed. One would expect it to be a freshwater organism yet it

                  On tJie Cones of Piniis pinaster. Bi/ Prof. Diceson.

   The author called attention to a scries of cones of Finus pinaster, exhibiting
transitions from one spiral system to another by what has been called " con-
vergence of secondary spirals." Such transitions, he pointed out, were due to the
fusion of two consecutive scales in some one of the secondary spirals. This fusion
of two scales does not produce any disturbance in the set of secondary spirals in
which it occurs, but causes a definite diminution in the number of all the other
sets of secondary spirals. The undisturbed set of secondary spirals, as running
continuously through the two systems. Prof. Dickson tenns " constants." That
the above explanation of the phenomenon of convergence is really correct he holds

--to be virtually proved : 1st, by the fact that in a good many cases a distinctly

double scale, formed by coalescence of the two, actual!}' occurs at the point of con-
vergence 2nd, that all gradations of fusion from a distinctly double to apparently

                                                  ;

single scale occur; and, ord, that in all cases of transition by convergence, whether
witli or without a distinctlj' double scale, the resulting spiral is invariably iden-
tical with that which, if the system of the lower spiral and the number of the
constants be given, would theoretically result from fusion of the consecutive

Bcales in one of the constants.

    The author exhibited a number of large Sfiffmarice obtained by him from the
fossiliferous strata intercalated between beds of various traps (Porphyrite, Green-

stone, &c.) at Auchentorlie, near Bowling, on the river Clyde. These appeared.
for the most part to occur in mudstone, which doubtless jepresents the soil in
which these rhizomes were imbedded. The fossils in question had their structure
beautifully preserved by infiltration with calcium carbonate. Besides plant-
remains in the mudstones, shales, and impure coal of this locality, there occur in the

shales (as has been pointed out by Mr. John Young of Glasgow) the teeth and scales

of Lower-Carboniferous fishes referable to the genera Palcvoniscns and Amhhjptcrvs,

had  recently  examined  another species  of the  same form                                                     and  the  author  was
                                                                                                             ;

enabled to confirm the main result arrived at by him, that Mitraria was tlie larval

form of an annelid. In some fundamental points, however, regarding the pro-

cess of development, his observations did not agree witli tho.se of Ihe Kussian

zoologist ; while in structure there are some important features which have not

--been described by either Miiller or Mecznikofl" diflerences which may, in some

cases at least, depend on actual differences between the species examined.

The nervous system is well developed, and consists in the principal central por-

tion of a large quadrilateral ganglion, formed by the union of two lateral ones, and

situated on the summit of the transparent dome-like bodj' of which the larva

mainly consists. From this two very distinct chords are sent downwards, so as to

form a pair of commissures with two small ganglia which are situated at the
opposite side of the alimentarj' canal. Besides the.<:e, two other small ganglia

exist in the walls of the dome at the oral side of the great apical ganglion, and
two similar ones at the aboral side ; these send off numerous filaments, which

dive at once into the walls of the dome, while each sends off a long filament to the
region where the alimentary canal begins to bend downwards towards its aboral
termination. The great apical ganglion supports two sessile ocelli, with pigment

and lens, and two small sphencal vesicles, each containing a clear spherical cor-

puscle. These last the author regards as auditory capsules.
--130 REPORT 1872.

  A system of vessels (probably water-vascular) was also described. Tbis con-

sists mainly of a sinus whicb surrounds tbe great apical ganglion, and sends off
tbree brancbes, wbicb run in a radial direction in tbe walls of tbe dome, two
lateral and one aboral, and appear to open into a sinus wbicb surrounds its base.

    In tbe progress of development tbe aboral end of tbe alimentary canal becomes
 elono-ated in tbe direction of tbe axis of tbe dome, carrying witb it the walls of

· tbe base of tbe dome, wbicb are to form tbe proper body-walls of tbe future worm ;
and in tbis way a long cylindrical appendage becomes developed, and bangs from
tbe central point of tbe base. At first tbere is no trace of segmentation ; and tbis
is subsequently induced on the cylindrical body of the worm by tbe formation of

 consecutive annular constructions.

    The process of development, as observed by tbe author in tbe species of Ilitraria
 examined by bim, thus differs in several points from that observed by Mecznikoff.

Among these the most important is that tbe ventral side of the worm is formed

 simultaneously with tbe dorsal instead of subsequently to it and independently of

 it, as in the case described by Mecznikofi". The development of tbe worm was not

 traced to the ultimate disappearance of tbe dome-like body of tbe larva.

On some points in the Development of Vorticcllidas. By Prof. Allman, F.E.S.

   The author described, in a beautiful branched and clustered Vorticellidan, a
process different from any which bad been recorded by those observers who had
described the so-called encysting process and the behaviour of tbe " nucleus " in

tbe Vorticellidae.

In almost everj^ cluster some of tbe zooids composing it bad become greatly altered

in form they had increased in size, and instead of tbe bell-shaped form of tbe
                                           ;

others, had assumed a globular shape, and bad lost both oral orifice and ciliary

apparatus, while their supporting peduncle bad ceased to be contractile. In the

younger ones tbe contractile space of tbe unchanged zooid was still very evident,

·but was fixed, showing no tendency to alteration of size, and tbe so-called nucleus
was very distinct and larger than in the ordinarj' zooids. The whole bad become

enveloped in a transparent gelatinous-looking investment.

In a slightly more advanced stage another envelope, in the form of a brown

borny capsule, begins to be secreted between the proper wall of the zooid and tbe

external gelatinous investment. It is at first thin and smooth, but it gradually

acquires considerable thickness, and becomes raised on its outer surface into ridges

enclosing hexagonal spaces.

In this stage tbe capsule has become too opaque to admit of a satisfactory view

into its interior ; but if the capsule be carefullj' opened, its contents may be libe-

rated so as to render apparent their real nature. It will be then seen that these

consist of a minutely granular semifluid plasma surrounding tbe " nucleus," which

has much increased in size and occupies a large portion of the csivity of tbe cap-
sule. Tbe condition of the contractile space coidd not be determined ; it has pro-

bably altogether disappeared.

In a further stage tbe " nucleus" has undergone an  important                                          change                                for  in-
                                                                                                                                          ;

stead of tbe long cylindrical form it had hitherto presented, it has become irregu-

larly branched, has acquired a softer consistence, and has, moreover, broken itself
up into two or more pieces. Tbis change in the " nucleus " is invariably accom-

panied by tbe appearance of nucleated cell-like bodies, which are scattered through

the corpuscular plasma which had filled the  rest  of the  capsule                                     they are of                           con-

siderable size, of a spherical form, and witb their nucleus occupying tbe greater

part of their cavity, and having its nucleolus represented by a cluster of granules.
   In obber capsules, apparently tbe more advanced, no trace of tbe so-called nu-

cleus of the vorticella-body could be detected and it seems to be entirely replaced
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

by the spherical nucleated cells, which had now still further increased in number.

It is impossible not to regard these cells as tbe result of tbe disintegration of the
"nucleus ;" and the conclusion is a legitimate one that they are finally liberated by the

natural dehiscence of the capsule, and become developed into new Vorticellidans,

             On tlie Structure of Noctiluca. B>/ Prof, Allman, F.E.S,

The author gave an account of some researches he had made on Noctiluca mili-

aris. They were mostly confirmatory of the results arrived at by other observers,

more especially by Krohn, Quatrefages, Busch, Huxley, and Webb, while they

furtlier served to supplement the observations of these zoologists.

At one end of the meridional depression is the vibratile flagellum with the

mouth at its base ; and here the depression becomes quite superficial, while the
opposite end is much deeper, and is here abruptly terminated by a vertical wall.

Just outside of this deep end of the depression there commences, by a funnel-

shaped enlargement, a very slightly elevated ridge of a hrmer consistence thau the

rest of the  body                            it terminates abruptly after running down, in a meridional direc-
                                          ;

tion, over about one third of the eircumfereuce of the body. The author had

reason to believe that this ridge is traversed in its length by a canal which opens

close to the aboral extremity of the meridional depression by a funnel-shaped

orifice. The mouth leads into a short cylindrical gullet ; and the author confirmed

the existence of the vibratile ciliuni contained v^dthin the gullet, as originall}' de-

scribed by Krohn, and of the ridge, with its projecting tooth, described by Huxley

as existing in the gullet-walls. The floor of the gullet is formed by the central

mass of protoplasm, here naked and in direct contact with the surrounding medium.

The vibratile eilium springs from this floor ; and near the root of the ciliuni is a

depression in the floor, which can bo followed for a little distance into the pro-

toplasm.

Besides the well-known branching processes which radiate from the central mass

of protoplasm to the walls of the body, there is also sent oft" from the central mass

a broad, irregularly quadrangular process, which extends to the outer walls, where

it becomes attached along the line of the superficial meridional ridge. The lower

free edge of this broad process has the form of a thickened border, and at its upper
edge it becomes continuous with a plate-like striated structure, which the author

rej^arded as representing a duplicature of the body- walls.
   In contact with the central protoplasm is the nucleus, a clear spherical body

about 2^/0 °f ^^ inch, in diameter.

  --The "body-walls are composed of two layers an external thin, transparent, and

structureless membrane, and an internal thin granular layer of protoplasm, which
lines the structureless membrane throughout its whole extent, and which receives
the extremities of the radiating processes from the central mass. Under the action

of iodine solution and other reagents, the protoplasmic layer may be seen to detach

itself from the outer structureless membrane, and, along with the radiating bands,
contract towards the centre. It admits of an obvious comparison with the pri-

mordial utricle of the vegetable cell.

   The flagellum, which is given off close to the margin of the mouth, is a flattened
band-like organ, gradually nan-owing towards its free extremity, and with its axis
transversely striated like a voluntary muscular fibre throughout its whole length.

It seems to have the power of elevating its edges, so as to render one of its surfaces

concave, and thus becomes converted into a semitube, which may assist in the

conveyance of nutriment towards the mouth.

   The nucleus is a spherical vesicle, with clear colourless contents, among which

minute transparent o^al corpuscles may usually be detected. When acted on

by acetic acid, the difference between tlie contents of the vesicle and its wall be-

comes very apparent ; and the contents may now be seen accumulated towards the

centre as a minutely granular mass, with some of the oval corpuscles entangled

in it.

   The radiating ofl'sets, which extend from the central protoplasm to the peri-
pheral layer, contain well-defined clear corpuscles, which slowly change their rela-

tive places, as if under the influence of very feeble currents. These oftsets, indeed,
closely resemble the radiating protoplasm-filaments which extend from the proto-
plasm surrounding the nucleus to the walls of the primordial utricle in the vege-

table cell. The peripheral layer contains, scattered through it, numerous minute
cell-like bodies : these are spherical and of various sizes ; in the larger ones a

fiistinct central nucleus may bo detected.
--132 UEPOET 1872.

    It is scr.rcely correct to regard the central mass of protoplasm as a true stomach.
The author had failed to find any evidence of a permanent gastric or somatic cavit_y ;
nnd he reo-arded the protoplasm mass to which the gullet leads as representing the
"parenchyma" of the Infusoria, and, like this, allowing of the solid food being

forced down into it from the gullet and there encysted in extemporaneously formed
vacuolre. The food also frequently forces its way from the central mass into the
radiating processes ; and diatoms and other microscopic organisms may be seen in

these processes enclosed in cyst-like dilatations of them, extemporaneously formed
for their reception at various distances from the central protoplasm.

    It was considered probable that the canal which seems to exist in the superficial

i-idi'-e artbrds exit for certaiu efiete matters, which may be conveyed to it through

the process by which it is kept in connexion with the central protoplasm.
    Our knowledge of the phenomena of reproduction and development in Nodihica

is still very imperfect, and the authoi" saw little which seemed capable of throwing

additional" light on this subjeci. He regarded it, however, as probable that the

nucleated cell-lilce bodies which are present in the peripheral layer of protoplasm
have a reproductive function, and are destined after liberation to become developed
into new individuals.

   From the account now given it will be apparent that Xoctihca consists essen-

tially of an enormously vacuolated protoplasm, involving a nucleus and enclosed
in a'structureless sac, the vacuolation taking place to such an extent as to separate
the contents into a peripheral layer of protoplasm which remains adherent to the
outer sac, and into a central mass which is kept in communication v,-ith the peri-
pheral layer by processes of protoplasm which pass from one to the other. The
author believed that the nucleus of A'uctiluca had a significance difierent from that
 of the so-called nucleus of the ordinary Infusoria, and that it admitted of a closer
 comparison with the true cell-nucleus. lie was of opinion that the nearest ally of
NucW.Kca would be found in the somewhat anomalous infusorial genus Pcrklinia.

    hi conclusion the author detailed some observations he had made on the lumi-
nosity of Noctiluca ; and he gave reasons for maintaining that the seat of the phos-
 phorescence is entirely confined to the peripheral layer of protoplasm which lines
the external structureless membrane.

           Oil tlie Siiiic'ure of Ed^va^dsia. Uy Prof. Allman, F.R.S.

    The structure of this beautiful little Actinozoon differs in many important points
from that of both the Zoautharian and Alcyonarian polypes. It was shown that
just within the mouth the walls of the stomach-sac project into the cavity of the

--sac in such a way as to form eight complicated frill-like lobes that the eight

vertical radiating lamellae which project into the body-cavity from the outer walls,
 and are composed of parallel longitudinal fibres enclosed between two membranous

--layers, do not reach the stomach-sac in any part of their course and that eight

 strong muscular bundles pass symmetrically through the whole length of the body-
 cavitjs being attached at one end to the disk which carries the tentacles, and at
 the other to the floor of the body-cavity, while they are free in their intervening

 course.

    Attached along the length of about the posterior half of each muscular bundle is
 the long sinuous generative baud, with its chord-like craspedum loaded with thread-
 cells. Just before terminating at the lower opening of the stomach-sac each of the
 eight generative bands enters a most remarkable pectinated organ, which appears to
 be quite rmrepresented in any other group of the Crelenterata. It was difficult to
 suggest the true significance of these organs ; their relation to the generative bands

 might lead to the belief that they are testes, or they maybe analogous to the so-called
 cement-glands v,'hich exist near the outlet of the oviducts in some of the lower
 animals. In this case they might supply some additional investment to the ova

 at the time of extrusion.

    The author regarded Edwardsia as presenting a very distinct type of actinozoal
 structure, whicli occupies an intermediate position between that of the zoantharian

 and that of the alcyonarian polypes. He also compared it with the extinct rugose

coraligenous representative.

                               On the Structure of Cyphonautes. B)/ Prof. Allman, FM.S.

This remarkable little organism, whose structure and ultimate destination have

been variously described by ditl'ereut observers, was obtained by the author in
considerable abundance in Moray Firth. The animal is enveloped in a mantle,

and the whole enclosed in a delicate, transparent, structureless test formed by two

valve-lilio triangular plates, which are in contact along two edges, and separated

from one another by a narrov/ internal along the third. Its form is thus that of a

very much compressed pyramid. The author distinguishes by the term base the

broader edge where the two plates of the test are separated' from one another,

while the other two edges are distinguished as the anal and abanal edges. The

apex is the angle opposite to the base ; and here a narrow passage exists, throu"-h

vvhich the fleshy vralls of the mantle are brought into immediate contact with the

surrounding water.

In the base are two largo oval openings, one (the larger) situated towards the

anal edge, and the other towards the abanal. The former leads directly into the

cavity                         of the  mantle                                     its  edges  are  prolonged  by  a  hollow  membranous  lobe,
                                                                               ;

ciliated on its margin, and uninterruptedly continued round the anal side of the

opening, but deficient on tlie opposite side.

  A largo part of the mantle-cavity is occupied by the pharynx, a spacious thin-

walled sac, which opens into the mantle-cavity by a long curved somewhat

S-shaped slit with thickened and ciliated margins, which at one side are continued,
in the form of two short ciliated tentacles, beyond the large opening situated near
the anal side of the base. Towards the apex the pharynx becomes suddenly narrow,

and is here lined by vibratile cilia, and marked by circular striiB which possibly

indicate the presence of sphincter fibres. It now "turns towards tlie anal side, and

then bends downwards towards the base and enters a tliick-walled snbcylindrical

stomach. This runs towards the base parallel to and a little within the "anal edge
of the test, and is ultimately continued into a short straight intestine, which ter-
minates by an anal orifice in the mantle-cavity near the outer opening of the latter.

From the upper part of the walls of the pharynx a narrow bundle of fibres passes

to the ape.x of the mantle-cavit}'.

Upon each side of the pharynx, and lying against the stomach and intestine, is a

large oval mass. Its situation would suggest the probability of its being an hepatic

organ                          but it is altogether                                    so  enigmatical that it would be rash, with'oiu' present
                            ;

knowledge of it, to insist on assigning to it any special significance.

   In contact with each of these enigmatical organs is a small tubercle, from which
a bundle of short fibres pass ofi' in a radiating direction. The resemblance of these

bodies to a pair of nervous ganglia is obvious; but the author was more inclined to
regard them with Schneider as indicating points of attachment of the contained
animal to the two calves of the test.

    The smaller of the two openings in the base (that, namely, which is situated

 near the abanal edge of the animal) is, like the other, surrounded by a hollow
 membranous _ lobe with ciliated margin; this is uninterruptedly continued round

 the abanal side of the opening, but is deficient on the opposite side. The openini^
 leads into a special chamber entirely shut off from the cavity of the mantle and
 from_ the pharynx. The walls of "the chamber are lined v\dth cilia, and it has
 within it, or in immediate connexion with its walls, two peculiar structures. One
. of these is a somewhat pyriform organ, which, with the narrow end close to the
 orifice of the chamber, extends from this point into its cavity ; it is composed of

 a ms.<:s of spherical bodies. Tlie other extends over the roof of the chamber in
 form of a cap : it consists of two portions, one of which lies directly on the
 walls of the roof and has a transversely laminated structure, which, however, dis-
 appears towards the abanal side of the 'chamber ; the other is an oval mass of' glo-
 bular cell-like bodies, and lies on the free convex surface of the laminated portion.

     Flere, again, this part of the Cyphonautes is iu the highest degree enigmatical ·
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and yet it is difficult not to believe that in the structures just described we have

an ovary and testis vt^ith associated accessory structures.
   The author observed no further fact which might tend to throw light on the

ultimate destination of Cyphoxautes, and more especially nothing which might

tend to confirm the remarkable views lately published by Schneider, who believes
that he has traced its development into the polyzoal Membranqmra pilosa. The

structure is considerably more complicated than Schneider seems to be aware of
while the opinion of this observer, that tlie whole of the proper Cyphonaute s
structure becomes absolutely obliterated, and the body of the animal converted
into an amorphous mass of cells, from which the Meinhrunipora becomes evolved,
not by a process of budding, but by a differentiation of structiu'e, is so startling,

that, notwithstanding the partial assent lately given to it by Nitsche, we are com-

pelled to wish for further contirmation of the evidently careful observations of the

German zoologist.
   If the abanal chamber described above with its associated structures really be-

longs to the generative system ("and it is hard to say what else it can be), the view

that Ct/phonautci is a polyzoal larva is scarcely tenable.

phins a long rostre, des Ziphioides de toutes les grandeurs et des Cetaces a fanons
de toutes les dimensions. C'est de ces derniers que nous voulous parler dans ce

sables nous trouvons des couches quaternaires dans lesquelles on decouvre assez
abondamment des restes d'Elt5phant, de Rhinoceros, d'Ours, d'Hyene, de Renne,

exceptions pres,tous animaux terrestres. Nous avons recueilli,menie au milieu de ces

C'est done, contrairemeut a co que nous montrent les animaux terrestres, pendant

on pas dire que c'est aussi dans le cours des dernieres periodes geologiques, que
les mers se sont le plus accrues et se sont le plus completement separees des con-

        Call's Loci- Salmon-pass or ^wimminrj-stair. By Richard Cail.

   After remarking upon the importance of the subject of salmon-passes, and the
failure, more or less decided, which had hitherto attended experiments in erecting
them, the author went on to describe his " Lock-pass or Swimminc/stair." It con-

sists essentially of a series of troughs or locks arranged like the" steps of a stair-
they are kept constantly filled, and communicate with each other throuo-h sub-
merged apertures.

   The arrangement is such as to connect in a continuous chain of deep water
flowing at a moderate speed, the upper and lower levels of a stream or river, whether
broken either naturally by a fall or artificially hy a dam. The front of the pass is
made high, so as to divert all flood-water from the dam or impounded water into
the highest lock. The feed-aperture is situated considerably below the apex of
the dam, and is larger than any of the other apertures which communicate between
lock and lock; cou.sequeutlj' all the locks become full of water, and the surplus over-
flows at the brim of each. The apertures which unite the locks are therefore all

subniei'pfed, aud they coustitute a continuous line of commuuicatiou hj water be-

tween the lower and upper stream, however great the difterence in level may be,

a higher fall merely requiring a greater number of locks than a lower. To mo-

derate the velocit}' of the flow of water through the trough-aperture, the apertures

are not placed in continuous line, but diagonally opposite, with small jetties. The

difference in level between each lock will generally be about 15 inches, and tho

size of the locks G or 7 feet square ; the area of the trough-apertures about 1 foot,

that of the feed-apertures being about one fourth larger. When space is limited

and the height to be surmounted considerable, the locks may be arranged like a

winding or spiral stair.                                           ^The plan of construction ia not costly generally it may

                Note on the cmjyloyrnent of Yachts in Deep-sea liesearches.

                   By Capt. Maeshall Hall, F.G.S., F.C.S., cj-c.

   Having had some experience in dredging &c. from a yacht, and having met
with sundry yacht-owners who would like to join in such pursuits, the author sug-
gests that the British Association would be a proper body to form a Committee to
encourage, oi'ganize, direct, and inform yachting naturalists with regard to the

mode in which they could be of most use. He considers that though no single
small vessel without steam aud experienced men could investigate a locality

thoroughly, yet, by an interchange of apparatus and a division of the work to be
done (one yacht taking current observations and sounding, another the dredging,
and so forth), a small squadron making a rendezvous, say, at some little-known "V\''est-
India island or the Canaries, might accomplish verj' complete and interesting in-
vestigations, besides doing valuable work nearer home.
                                                                             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                          137

ile suggests that a yacht of, say, 150 tous is the most practically useful size, not

being too large to get uudor weigh quickly, and yet of sufficient size to carry stores,

gear, a steam-launch, fuel, and engine, the last to ))e equally available for the launch-
screw and a winch on the ship's deck.

Eut he also considers smaller craft to be equallj^ useful in some ways.

The Committee might be empowered to communicate with the J loyal Yacht

Clubs and  ask  the                                                          support  of  naturalist members                                                                            they might  also  consider  the
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

advisability of voting grants for attachiug " experts " to such squadrons to describe

the more perishable animals Sec. on the spot.

    lu conclusion the author points out the assistance to the supply of large aquaria

--which the development of tastes for dredging would be yaciits visiting fishing-

stations and saving alive the prizes allowed by fishermen to be wasted, dredging
with the yachts and boats themselves, making the nearest British port with a
valuable cargo in portable tanlcs, and sending them alive to their inland or coast

homes.

Mr. J. Wasdall, of Scarborough, considers that the education of a body of sailors to

zoological work, the keeping of a list of them, so that yacht owners might know whore

to find such skilled hands, would be one of the valuable results of the labours of such
a Committee. The interchange of expensive apparatus and gear would be another.

On tlie MoJhtsca of Europe compared with those of Eustcrn North America.
                     'By S. GwYN Jeffreys, F.B.S., F.G.S.

The author had dredged last autumn on the coast of New England, in a steamer

provided by the Government of the United States, and had inspected all the prin-

cipal collections of Mollusca made in Eastern North America. The author com-

pared the Mollusca of Europe with those of Massachusetts. lie estimated the

former to contain about 1000 species (viz. 200 land and freshwater, and 800 ma-

rine), and the latter to contain about 400 species (viz. 110 land, and freshwater,

and  290 marine)                                                             and  he  took  Mr. Binney's  edition                                                                       of the  late Prof.  Gould's

' Report on the Mollusca of Massachusetts' as the standard of comparison. That work

gives 407 species, of which the author considered 40 to be varieties, leaving 367

apparently distinct .species. About 30 species may be added to this number in

consequence of the recent researches of Prof. Verrill and Mr. Whiteavcs on the

coast of New England and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. He identified 173 out of

                               per cent. ; and ne proauced tabulated lists ot the species in sup-

port of his statement. He proposed to account for the distribution of the North-

American Mollusca thus identified by showing that the land and freshwater species

had probably migrated from Europe to Canada through Northern Asia, and that
most of the marine species must have been transported by the Arctic current through
Davis's Strait southward to Capo Cod, and the remainder by the Gulf-stream from
the Mediterranean and western coasts of tlie Atlantic in a northerly direction.

Preliminary Beport on JDredyinys in Lalce Ontario. Bi/ H. AtLEYN'E
    Nicholson-, 31. D., B.Sc, M.aI, F.E.S.E., Professor of katural History

    in University College, Toronto,

   In this communication the author gave a short preliminary account of a scries
of dredgings carried out in June and July in Lake Ontario.' This lake had not,
up to this time, been explored by the dredge ; and some valuable facts having been
brought to light in Lake Superior in 1871, by systematic dredging, he was there-
fore induced to apply to the Government of the Province of Ontario for a grant of

m oney to bo expended in dredging Lake Ontario. With a praiseworthy appre-

c iatiou of the true rahie of such researches, the Government at once generously

g ranted the necessary assistance. The dredgings -vveie carried on partly in a yacht

a nd partly in a steamer, and were prosecuted by hand, the apparatus employed

--being similar to that used in marine dredging, except that a bag of embroidery

canvas was placed outside the ordinary net an addition rendered necessary by the

extremely tine nature of the mud at great depths. Upon the whole, the results

obtained in Lal-ie Ontario agreed very fairly with those obtained in Lake Superior,

there being a general conformit}' in the phenomena observed. The fauna of Lake

Superior, however, so far as deep water is concerned, is decidedly richer than that

of  Lake                        Ontario                                        whilst  some of the more      remarkable  species discovered in  the
                                                                            ;

former appear to be absent in the latter. As might have been anticipated, the

fauna of Lake Ontario is not extensive, though some forms occur in great profusion.

The shallow-water fauna is very rich in individuals, and the number of species is

quite considerable for fresh water. Beyond eight or ten fathoms the fauna becomes

very scanty                                                         and when depths of from twenty to fifty fathoms are reached           the list
                                                                 ;

becomes reduced to some Annelides and Amphipod Crustaceans. The nature of

the bottom, also, at great depths is very unfavourable to life, consisting almost

everywhere of a fine, unpalpable, greyish-blue clayey mud, the temperature of

Avhich is very low.

    Out of thirty-one forms, in all, discovered by the author in Lalve Ontario, the

most interesting were the Annelides and Crustaceans, 'i'he Annelides were very

abundant, and consist of species of AV/j/ieZw and C/epsi/ie, Samiris and ChirodriHus,

some of the leeches presenting phenomena of especial interest. Of the Crnstcicea,

the most important is a little Amphipod, which occurred in depths of from thirty

to forty-five fathoms, and which the author identified with the Pontoporo'a offinis
of the Swedish lakes. This species and the Stomapod, Mijsis i-clkiu, are found

in Lakes Wetter and Wener in Sweden ; and it is well known that they have been

believed, upon good grounds, to support the view that these lakes had been at one

time connected with the sea. It is therefore a very interesting fact that these

species should both have been detected in Lakes Micliigan and Superior. The

Pontoporcia the author had now detected in I^ake Ontario ; but it is a singidar fact
that the Mysis (which is common in Lake Superior) had not been found to occur

at all in the dredgings carried on by the axithor.

    How a National Natural'History Museum mlr/Jd be huilt and arranged
                with advantage. By K. A. Peacock, C.E., F.G.S.

    The museum now building at Kensington is about 800 feet long by 200 feet

wide                            its  area, therefore,                                  is  about .3§ acres,  the market  value  of which  is  about
                             ;

£44,000. Its cost will be nearly £a.50,000. The circumference of the building is

2000 feet, which, multiplied by the three floors, gives a length of galleries of about
A(iOOO feet*.
                                                                    compMc collection of whales and dolphins would fill all this, and

there would be no space for any other animals, much less for the botanical and

other specimens. The known species of whales are thirtj'-two, of from 50 to 110

feet long, and seventy-two dolphins, from 12 to 2o feet; ^1nd the number of these

Getacea, Dr. Gray says, " will be very much extended." Taking the whales at the

average moderate length of 60 feet and the dolphins at 1.5 feet, we have a total length

of 3000 feet. But the writer believes a National Museum ought to contain a male skin

and skeleton and a female skin and skeleton of every species of Vertebrata, and the

young of the same, also a sectional drawing of e.ach species, showing the skeleton

within the skin. And Dr. Sclater is probably right in proposing that the young of all'

ages, examples of variation, and preparations of the internal structure should also

appear. It would therefore seem at first sight as if a length of at least 12,000

feet would be required ; but this may be very much reduced. The spaces provided

for the Cetacea in the sequel of this paper are 26 feet wide and from 20 down

to_  12  feet  high                           therefore  all but the largest whales                                                                                                                                                                                                                    can  be  placed  side by side,
                                           ;

with their respective skeletons suspended over them, and the young, varieties,

and preparations can be placed alongside without requiring additional lengths.

But allowing for the numbers being "very much extended," the total length

will certainly exceed a mile, and will therefore, as stated above, fill the museum
now building. The number of volumes now iu the J5ritish Museum Librarv ex-

ceeds a million, and is said to double itself in fifteen years. Thus in half a gene-

ration hence the books will have so much increased as not to leave room for either

of_ the great_ collections, viz. {a) the Arts and Curiosities, and (h) the Natural

History, which will also have increased ; and especially so if the present unex-

hibited portions of the collections should be exhibited, as they ought to be.

--13r. J. E. Gray says, in a letter to the present writer : " The space proposed [at

S. Kensington] is very small, not more than we have at present ; and there is a great
want of room for the unexhibited portion of the collection, not uearlv as much as
we have here" (Urit. Mus.). And he advocates the Arts and Curiosities being

placed in the museum now building : and, in truth, that appears to be the judicious

and inevitable conclusion, because it is simply impossible to build at S. Kensington

one of the usual rectangular museums of only three (? four) stories, which shall

hold all the specimens illustrating Zoologj-, Botany, Mineralogv, and Pah^ontology,

without spreading it over some 8 or 9 acres (worth £100,000), and an unneces-

sarily vast space to walk over. It would cause sad confusion to fit up the present
new building for Natural History, and afterwards to alter it for the reception of

the Arts and Curiosities.

 --Proposed New Museum. This will contain 2| miles nearly (in addition to the

auxiliary Cetacea-room of ].3o6 feet) of spaces and glass cases, for the Vertebrata

and fossils, and to be called the Animal Gallery. This gallery will also contain

880 window-cases covered with plate glass, each G feet long by '3 feet wide {i.e. a

--mile long by a yard wide), the whole well lighted by 880 large non-transparent

glass windows mainly for the Invertebrata. For 'Plants, Lecture-rooms, and

Librarj-, an area of 57,000 superficial feet is provided (=1J- acre nearly), and for
Mineralogy 50,000 superficial feet (li acre and more)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;  these would be lighted by a

circular non-transparent glass roof, 320 feet in diameter. All these spaces will'be

divided into a suitable number of separate rooms by non-transparent glass parti-

tions, so that (for example) only one species of Cetacean can be seen by each

person at once, to avoid confusion ; and galleries would be provided at half the

height for seeing closely all the very large specimens. The writer therefore pro-

poses to take 3§ acres at the angle formed by Prince Albert Road with Gore Road,

and forming a square of 400 feet ; of this area the angles would be occupied by various

auxiliary offices, &c. The central circular museum would be carried up to the

height of twelve stories or ICO feet, and would be 344 feet in diameter; and access
could be gained up or down in a few seconds, to any floor, at a cost of a hd., by
means of an hydraulic hoist worked by a small steam-engine. The entrance wouli

be by a porch 20 feet square, lighted by a glass roof, and containing in plate-glass

cases busts in marble of the most eminent naturalists, dead and living. On en-

tering the museum, to the right would be the Animal Gallery, which would form

an inclined plane, rising 1 in 47, and afterwards 1 in 94, and the heights of gallery

varying from 20 down to 9 feet. On the right as you ascend would be the windows

and window-cases, and on the left spaces surrounded by brass railings for the

Cetacea: next in order all the other living animals being VertebraFes; when

they have all been placed, the extinct animals will succeed in plate-glass cases,

behind which would be the work-rooms all the way to the top of the building.

The order would be, first, the latest vertebrate fossils, then the other vertebrate fossils

according to age, the oldest being at the top. Those who wished to see the fossils

in the usual order would always have the option of ascending by the hoist to begin.

The circular form has been chosen because a square of equal area would have a cir-

cumference of 130 feet greater length of wall and window, which, multiplied bv thg

height, 160 feet, gives an area of wall aud window saved by the circle of 21,7G0

superlicial feet. There would also be a saving in the distances to be walked over.

The whole museum would be lightning-proof aud also hre-proof, as no wood would

On a new lihlnoceros, luitJi Bemarhs on the Recent Species of this Genus and

   their Distribution. By P. L. Sciater, M.A., Ph.D., F.B.S., Secretary

    to the Zoological Society of London.

   On the 14th of February last the Zoological Society of London received in their

Gardens a female two-horned Ehinoceros, which had been captured near Chitta-
gong four years previously, and had been since kept in captivity at that station in
indfa. This animal had "been referred to Rhinoceros sumatrensis of Cuvier by the
author and by other writers who had spoken of it, that being the only species of
the Asiatic two-horned section of rhinoceroses hitherto recognized by naturalists.

   The recent acquisition of a female of tlie veritable E. sumatrensis from Malacca
had enabled the author to compare the two animals together, and had led hini to

the conclusion that the first-mentioned specimen belonged to a diti'erent_ species,
which he proposed to call Rhinoceros lasiotis, or Hairy-eared lUiinoceros, its most
obvious external peculiarity being the long hairs which fringe the ears.

   The existing species of Rhinoceros certainly known were considered by the

author to be six in number, viz. :

   The author exhibited specimens of bodies bearing the general external shape
and appearance of long thin tapering white willow wands from 4 to 6 feet in
leno-th, which he had received from Captain David Herd, of the Hudson's Bay
Company's service, with the information that they liad been brought by that
company's vessel from Barraud's Inlet, Washington Territory, North-west America.
The captain who brought them stated that they were the " backbones" of a gelatinous

fish shaped like a conger eel, which was very common in EarraiuVs Inlet, and
which swam about in shoals along with the dogfishes, tliat in the living animal

these " backbones " were transparent like the rest of tlie animal, but became ossified
when dried on the beach.

   Dr. Gray having obtained one of thoie rods had recently described it as being
either the axis of a Pennatulid animal or the " bone of a Cephalopod," under the
name OdeoceUa septmfrionaHs. But Mr. Sclater was of opinion that, supposing the
facts above stated to be true, these rods must be regarded as the ossified notochords
ofsome low organized fish with tlie skeleton wholly cartilaginous, probably belonging

to the Lampreys or to the Chiniojroid group.

--Instinct ivith original Observations on Touncj Animals. By D. A. Spalding*.

  --With regard to instinct, we have yet to ascertain the fixcts, Do the animals

exhibit untaught skill and innate knowledge ? May not the suppposcd cases of

instinct be, after all, but the results of rapid learning and imitation ? The contro-
versy on this subject has been chiefly concerning the perception-) of distance and

direction by the eye and the ear. Against the instinctive nature of these percep-
tions it is ai'gued that as distance means movement, locomotion, the very essence
of the idea is such as cannot be taken in by the eye or the ear--that what the
varying sensations of sight and hearing correspond to must be got at by moving

over the ground, by experience. The results, however, of experiments on chickens
were wholly in fiivour of the instinctive character of these perceptions. Chickens
kept in a state of blindness, by various devices, from one to three days, when

placed in the light under a set of carefully prepared conditions, gave conclusive
evidence against the theory that the perceptions of distance and direction by tlie

eye are the result of associations formed in the experience of each individual life.
Often at the end of two minutes they followed with their eyes the movements of
crawling insects, turning their heads with all the precision of an old fowl. In
from two to fifteen minutes they pecked at some object, showing not merely an
instinctive perception of distance, but an original ability to judge distance and

direction with something like infallible accuracy. If beyond the reach of their

necks they ran up to the object of their pursuit, and may be said to have invariably
struck it, never missing by more than a hair's breadth ; this, too, when the specks
at which they struck were no bigger than the smallest visible dot of an i. To seize
between the points of the mandibles at the very instant of striking seemed a more

difficult operation. Though at times they seized and swallowed an insect at the

very first attempt, most frequently they struck five or six times, lifting once or

twice before they succeeded in swallowing their first food. To take, by way of

illustration, the observations on an individual case a little more in detail : a chicken
at the end of six minutes, after having its eyes unveiled, followed with its head the
movements of a fly twelve inches distant ; at ten minutes the fly coming within
reach of its neck was seized and swallowed at the first stroke ; at the end of twenty
minutes it had not attempted to walk a step. It was then placed on rou,^h ground
within sight and call of a hen with chickens of its own age. After standing chii-p-
ing for about a minute, it went straight towards the hen, displaying as keen a per-
ception of the qualities of the outer world as it was ever likely to possess in after

life. It never required to knock its head against a stone to discover that there

was "no road that way." It leaped over the smaller obstacles that lay in its
path, and ran round the larger, reaching the mother in as nearly a straight line as
the nature of the ground would permit. Thus it would seem that prior to expe-

rience the eye, at least the eye of the chicken, perceives the primary qualities of

--the external world all arguments of the purely analytical school of psychology to

the contrary notwithstanding.

   No less decisive were experiments on hearing. Chickens hatched and kept in

the dark for a day or two, on being placed in the light nine or ten feet from a box
in which a brooding hen was concealed, after standing chirping^ for a minute or
two, uniformly set ofl:' straight to the box, in answer to the call of the hen, which

they liad neTer seen and never before lieard. This tliey did, struggling through

grass and over rough ground, when not yet able to stand on their legs. Again,
chickens that from the lirst had been denied the use of their ej'es by having hoods
drawn over their heads while yet in the shell, were, while thus blind, made the
subjects of experiment. These, when left to themselves, seldom made a for-
ward step, their movements were round and round and backward ; but when

placed within five or six feet of the hen-mother, they in answer to her call became

much more lively, began to make little forward journeys, and soon followed her by

sound alone, though of com-se blindly. Another experiment consisted in rendering

chickens deaf for a time, by sealing their ears with several folds of gum-paper
before they had escaped from the shell. These, on having their ears opened when
two or three days old, and being placed within call of the mother, concealed in a
box or on the other side of a door, after turning round a few times ran straight

to the spot whence came the first sound they had ever heard. Clearly of these

chickens it cannot be said that sounds were to them at first but meaningless sen-

sations.

One or two observations favourable to the opinion that animals have an Instinc-

tive knowledge of their enemies may be taken for what they are worth. When

mytwelve days old, one of  little ^/'o^e^cs, running about beside me, gave the pecu-

liar chiiT whereby they announce the approach of danger. On looking up, a

hawk was seen hovering at a great height overhead. Again, a young hawk

was made to fly over a hen with her first brood of chickens, then about a

week old. In the twinkling of an eye most of the chickens were hid among grass

and bushes ; and scarcely had the hawk touched the ground about twelve yards

from where the hen had been sitting, when she fell upon and would soon have

killed it outright. Even more striking evidence was furnished by a young

Whenturkey.  ten daj's old, it heard the voice of the hawk for the firsttime, and just

beside it. Like an arrow from the bow it darted off in the opposite direction, and

crouched in a comer, remained for ten minutes motionless and dumb with fear.

Out of a great number of experiments with chickens and bees, though the results

were not uniform, yet in the vast majority of instances the chickens manifested

instinctive fear of these sting-bearing insects.

But to return to examples of instinctive skill and knowledge, concernino- which

AI think no doubt can remain.  very useful instinct may be observed in the e.arly

attention that chickens pay to their toilet. As soon as they can hold up their
heads, when only from four to five hours old, they attempt dressing at their wings,
that, too, when they have been denied the use of tlieir eyes. Another incontestable
case of instinct may be seen in the art of scraping in search of food. Without any

opportunities of imitation chickens begin to scrape when from two to six days old.

Most frequently the circumstances were suggestive, at other times, however, the

first attempt, which generally consisted of a sort of nervous dance, was made on a

smooth table. The unacquired dexterity shown in the capture of insects is A'ery

Aremarkable.  duckling one day old, on being placed in the open air for the first

time, almost immediately snapt at and caught a fly on the wing. Still more

Wheninteresting is the art of catching flies peculiar to the turkey.  not a day

and a half old, I observed a young turkey, which I had adopted while yet in

the shell, pointing its beak slowly and deliberately at flies and other small insects

without actually pecking at them. In doing this its head could be seen to shake

like a hand that is attempted to be held steady by a visible efibrt. This I recorded

when I did not understand its meaning ; for it was not until after that I observed
that a turkey when it sees a fly settled on any object steals on the unwary insect

with slow and measured step, that when sufficiently near it advances its head very

slowly and steadily until within an inch or so of its prey, which is then seized by

a sudden dart. In still further confirmation of the opinion that such wonderful

examples of dexterity and cunning are instinctive and not acquired, maybe adduced

the significant fact that the individuals of each species have but little capacity to

Alearn any thing not found in the lives of their progenitors.  chicken was made

from the first and for several months the sole companion of a young turkey yet it
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

never showed the slightest tendency to adopt the admirable art of catching flies

that it saw practised before its eves every hour of the day.

    The only theory in explanation of tlio phenomena of instinct that has an air of

 science about it is the doctrine of inherited association. Instinct in the present

 generation is the product of the accumulated experiences of past generations. Great

 difficulty, however, is felt by many in conceiving how any thing so impalpable as

fear at the sight of a bee should pass by inheritance from parent to ofi'spiing. It
should be remembered, however, that the permanence of such associations in the

history of an individual life depends on the corresponding impress given to the
nervous organism. AVe cannot, strictly speaking, experience any individual ftict of

consciousness twice over ; but, as by pulling the bell-cord to-day we can, in tho
language of ordinary discourse, produce the same sound we heard yesterday, so,
while the established connexions among the nerves and nerve-centres hold, we are
enabled to live our experiences over again. Now, why should not these modifications

of brain-matter (that, enduring from hour to hour aud from day to day, render

acquisition possible) be, like any other physical peculiarity, transmitted from parent
to oflspring? That they are so transmitted is all but proved by the facts of

instinct, while these in their turn reeeiye their only rational explanation in this
theory of Inherited Association,

 Ifotes of a Deeji-sea Dmhj'mg-Expedition round the Island of Anticosti, in

             the Gulf of St. Lawrence. By J. F. WniTEAyES, F.'G.S.

    Through the kindness of the IIou. Peter Mitchell, Minister of Marine and

-Fisheries for the Dominion of Canada, who not only gave the author facilities for

dredging oii board Government vessels, but caused rope enough to be placed at his
disposal to enable him to examine the greatest depths, the expedition, of which
a brief descriptive resume- is here oftered, was undertaken. Five weeks were spent
at sea, and depths of from 100 to 250 fathoms were successfully explored during
the m<mths of July and August 1871.

   The area investigated includes an entire circuit of the island of Anticosti, as fiir

to the N. W. as Point des Monts (on the north shore of the Kivcr St. Lawrence),

and to the S.W. as the Magdalen Islands. It was the author's intention to
have tried to dredge in the deepest part of the gulf, in a spot situated halfway
between the east end of the island of Anticosti aud the Bird Eocks, where, ac-
cording to the Admiralty charts, the bottom is 313 fathoms deep. Unfortunately,
however, when this particular point was reached, and every thing got ready, a gale
from the N.W. sprung up, which made dredging quite impracticable.

   Attempts were made (by using a common thermometer with a metal case and

perforated base) to ascertain the temperature of the deep-sea mud. When im-

and tlic south shore, on one occasion, only made the mercury fall to from 42° to
45° Fahr. Sand brought up from 25 f\ithoms on the north "shore also made the
mercury sink to about 37° or 38° Falir.

   It is estimated that upwards of 100 species of marine invertebrates new to the
Gulf of St. Lawrence were collected. Of these, 30 or 40 have never been taken
before on the American side of the Atlantic, and several are new to science. The
number is made up as follows :

   The Hydrozoa and Anuelida have not yet been detevmiued, and only a small
portion of the Foraminifera have been critically examined.

   The following is a brief descriptive sketch of a few of the most interesting speci-
mens collected. More minute details of the results of the Expedition will shortly
be published by the author.

   The most curious of the Foraminifera is a Margumlina, about | of an inch in
length, from the lirst chamber of which spinous processes project at various
ano-les. These vary in number in the two specimens collected, and when perfect

were probably as long- as the shell itself.

   Among the sponges are Grantia ciliata of 0. Fabricius (the first sponge with

calcareous spicules recorded from the Gulf of St. Lawrence), a fine species of

Polymastia, and a massive HaUchondria with retentive bihamate spicules. Among

the Actinozoa the most conspicuous novelty is a beautiful species of Pentiatula,
near to the European P. jjfio.fpJiorea, but sufficiently distinct from it, for which
the author proposes the name Pennatula canadensis. Upwards of forty living
examples were dredged in deep watsr, some of which are 8 inches long. The

genus is new to the American side of the Atlantic. Other interesting Ooelenterates
from the deep sea are a little social anemone, a species of Zoanthits, a new genus of
Alcyonoids near to Cornuhiria, and JEinep/ithi/a f/hmer<tta, the latter only known
previously from Greenland and the banks of Newfoundland. Two rare echino-
derms were collected : one of them is a well-known Norwegian heart urchin, the
Brissus fruf/ilis of Dilben and Koren, the Schizaster fra;/i/is of more modern writers :

the other. Prof. A. Agassiz informs the author, is the " curious Asterid allied to

Pterastcr" which Prof. Wyville Thomson named Calveria hydrix; the name
has, however, been proposed for two widely dilierent species in the same journal.
The Canadian starfish Prof. A. Agassiz thinks may be the Solaster fitrcifer of

Diiben and Koren.

   No large crabs or lobsters were taken in deep water. The group is only repre-

sented apparently in the greater depths by a few curious arctic shrimps. In 125
fathoms, off Cap-Hosier lighthouse, fine specimens of Nymphon yiyanteum, Goodsir,

and Munnopsis typica of Sars were taken. Several living examples of a Pycno-
gonum, undistinguishable from the European P. Utlorale, were brought up by
hempen tangles from 212 fathoms.

    The deep-water Polyzoa are ^ery interesting and curious. The most striking
among them are : Defrancia luccrnaria, Sars ; Itdcpnra celluJosa, var. clouyata,
Smitt; Flmtra Parlcei, Busk; Picellaria ciliata, I^inu. ; and Alcyonidium gelati-

 nosuni, Pallas.

   With the exception of a purple Pofrylliis, apparently new, the few Tunicates
obtained are well-known nortiiern New-England species.

   The following species of shells collected are new to the western side of the

 Atlantic :

Area pectunculoides, ScaccJii.      Utriculus hyalinus, Turton.

Portlandia frigida, Torell.         Dentaliuin abyssorura, Sars.

   Three small fishes were on separate occasions taken in the dredge. Of tliese,
one is a small example of the Norway liaddock (Sebastes norveyicus), one a young
wolf fish (Anarrhichas lii2)i/s), and the other a gurnard of the genus Agonus,

    Nearly all the marine inyertebrates of the noiiherii part of the Gulf of the St.

Lawrence are purely arctic specie,?.
    Three fourths of the Mollusca of Greenland, for example, range as far south as

 Gaspe Bay. Quite a number of cliaracteristic Nc-w-England species are found off

the coasts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick : a few of these, such as the oyster^

tind their northern limit in the southern part of the Bay of Chaleurs.

   An irregular line of shallow soundings extends from near the northern extremity

of the island of Cape Breton, round the Magdalen group, and thence in a westerly
direction to Bona\euture Island. To the north, north-east, and north-west of this
line the water deepens suddenly, and perhaps even precipitously. To the south

and south-west of this line the water is shallow, and never exceeds -50 fathoms in
depth. Principal Dawson suggests that possibly the Subcarboniferous limestone
(of which the Magdalen Islands are composed, and which appears again on the

mfiin shore in Bonaventure County and elsewhere) may crop up under the sea
in this shallow area. The line of shallow soundings may form a natural banier to
those arctic currents, if there be such, which sweep down the straits of Belle Isle
in a south-westerly direction, and may delicct their course in a bold curve into
and up the river St. Lawrence. In the same way this line may form the sepa-

ration between a purely arctic fauna and one of a more southern character.
   The species which belong exclusivelj' to the deep sea in Canada have a decidedly

Scandinavian aspect. Most of the specimens collected, which are new to the
American side of the Atlantic, arc well-known Norwegian, Spitzbergeu, or Scotch

species.

   It is proposed to continue these investigations through the present summer, the
Canadian Government having voted a small simi of money to defray the expenses

of the expedition.

                             Anatomy and Physiology.

               Address to the Dejuoivient of Anatonnj and Physiology.

                  By Professor Euedon Sandeeson, M.D., F.li.S.

  We are met here for the purpose of hearing papers on Anatomy and Physiology.

It would not have been inappropriate to have given you some account of the limits

of the two very distinct sciences which are so designated ; but as I am anxious to

occupy your time for as short a period as possible, I shall content myself with
saying that the few observations I have to make will have reference only to the

science to which I am myself attached. I make this preliminary explanation, for
the positions of the two sciences in England are so different that much that I may

say about Physiology is not applicable to Anatomy.
   I should have been glad if it had been possible to have occupied the time in

giving you a retrospective account of the progress of phj'siological research during
the past year. I had intended to do so, but was led to abandon mj' intentions on the

groimd that although the work done has not been inconsiderable, we in England have

taken very little part in it. If I had attempted the task, I should have been but

chronicling the doings of our friends in Germanj', who are now holding their own
scientitic assembly in Leipzig. As I do not wish to talk about German physio-

logists to-day, I find it more agreeable and more encom-aging to look forward

than to look back; for although we English physiologists (I say physiologists

advisedly, because the anatomists are not in the same position) must admit with

regret that we have had very little to do with the rinprecedented development of
our science during the last two decades, we do not intend to continue in the same

inactive condition in future.

   Considering that half tlie pni"pose of our meeting in this Section is to promote

its position, and particularly to secure a future more fruitful of substantial results

than the past has been.
. I shall begin by asserting a general principle, which, as I go on, I shtiU endea-
J46 REPOiiT--1872.

--vour to justify that oue great reason -wliy pliysiological researcli is less success-

fully pursued iu Englaud thau we could wish it to be, lies in the general want of

scientific education. In illustration of this position, I shall refer first to that

liiglier training which is required for the production of scientific workers or

investigators ; secondly, to what may be called the education of public opinion, by

the popularizing agency of books and lectures ; and, lastly, to the introduction

of Natural Science as an element of education in our great schools and uni-

versities.

If a man wants to be a physiologist he must, as things at present stand, study

medicine. There is no logical reason for this ; for although medicine ought to be

built on physiology, there is no reason why a physiologist should know any thing

about the art of curing diseases. Practically, however, it is the case that the kind

of education which a man requires in order to be a physiologist is best obtained

through a course of medical study. I confess myself to be of the opinion that this

close relation between medicine and physiology is likely to be a permanent one, on

the general ground that any science is likely to bo studied witli more earnestness

by those who have to practise an art founded upon it than by others. For example,

in England there can be little doubt that it is to our preeminence over all countries

in the mechanical arts that our possession of exceptionally great men in the ph)'-

sical sciences on which those arts are built is due. The reason why the same sort

of beneficial reaction of art upon science has not manifested itself in our own

sphere is, that the connexion between the two, i. e. between physiology and medi-

Wecine, is much less substantial.  physiologists are not yet in a position to advise

the doctors, and they, resting on the more reliable teaching of experience, are quite

willing to do without us.

  If I am right in supposing that the pursuit of physiological research will always

be closely connected with medical study, it becomes a matter of interest to us to

know in how far the existing institutions for teaching are fitted for the training of

scientific men.

  We who are personally concerned in the teaching of medicine must, I think,

admit that, as regards English schools, an ordinar}' medical course is not a very
good preparation for scientific work. The reason of this is that the " medical

--sciences," as they are called^chemistry, anatomy, and physiology have developed

far too fast for the resources of our schools. Physiologj'', which twenty years

ago might (witliout very fiagrant absurdity) have been called the handmaid of
medicine, has become a great science quite independent of the art which brought

her into existence. No longer learning from medicine as she used to do, but based
entirely on experiment, she claims much closer relationship with the other expe-

rimental sciences, and particularly with physics and chemistry, than with her

parent art.

   Let us suppose ourselves carried back, say twenty years. Twenty years ago a

lecture-room, with a gallery for showing preparations under the microscope, was

all that was thought necessary for teaching physiology, even in the best appointed

schools ; but then how ditt'erent was that time from the present as regards the

position of the science. I can only refer to one or two of the directions in which

 irogress has been made. Take, for example, the exchange of gases iu respiration.

In 1852 aU that we knew on this subject was founded on the imperfect methods and
analyses of the physicist Magnus. Now Ludwig aud his pupils have put us in
possession of a knowledge which for exactitude may be compared with that of tlio

fundamental facts of physics. In 185:3 Ludwig had but lately written his earliest
papers on arterial pressure, and had thus, by the introduction of new methods, in-

augurated a new era in the physiology of the mechanical functions. Du Bois-Eey-
moud had scarcely begun that series of researches by which he, like Ludwig, rather
founded a new science than extended the limits of an old oue. In France Brov.-n-

Sequard had discovered the functions of vasomotor nerves, and Bernard the glyco-

genic function of the liver.

   Great as was the intrinsic value of all these investigations, it was surpassed by

Howthat of the influence which they exercised on the future progi-ess of science.

Witli the exception of the somewhat obscm-e region of what is called animal

chemistiy, every chapter has been rewritten on the sure basis of dii-ect observation

--and experiment the mechanics of the circulation, the chemical changes in the

blood and tissues in respiration, the relation between muscular movements and the

central organs of the ncryoLis system which preside over them, the electrical
changes which go on in nerves and muscles when in and out of action, and, in

physiological histology, the mode of central and peripheral termination of nerve-

libres, and the anatomy of the lymphatic glands and the mode of origin of the

absorbent system in the tissues.

   In this great progress one would rather not have to admit that Germany has

done so large a proportion of the work. France, notwithstanding her great

leaders in science and her great scientific institutions, has accomplished much less

than she ought to have done. In talcing her part, England has been represented by

us, the teachers in her medical schools ; but we, possessing neither space nor appli-

ances for the prosecution of experimental inquiries, have contented ourselves only

too readily with reaping the fruits of other men's labours.

It would not be pleasant to make this admission, were it not possible to look

forward with considerable confidence to something better. Li the gi'eat medical

schools of London, in the old universities, and in one or two, at least, of the pro-

vincial schools great efforts are now being made to provide adequate buildings and

competent persons for the experimental teaching and study of physiology. It is,
I think, a most encouraging sign of the times that the initiative in this movement

has been taken by Trinity College, Cambridge. That wealthy corporation, whose

very name recalls to our recollection the intellectual glories of our coimtry, has con-

descended to provide a place for physiologists to study and labour in, from which

(short as the time is during which it has existed) one or two valuable researches

have already sprimg. To what the University of London has done during the last

twelve months, in establishing a laboratory for inquiries into that most important

though comparatively new branch of physiology which relates to the origin and

nature of diseases, it is scarcely possible for me to refer, excepting in so far as to

myexpress  hope that its influence will eventually be felt in strengthening the hold

of physiology on practical medicine.

  Notwithstanding these efforts, it will take years to regain the position which we

in England once had, and ought never to have lost. The appliances and places

for work are now forthcoming, and can be extended as they are required. This is a

great step forwards ; but we still want the pecuniary resources requisite for carry-
ing out systematic and continuous researches, and, above all, we have still to

educate workers.

   Of the two wants I have mentioned, the want of money and the want of
workers, the second is the most important. The difficulties which lie in our way

--in this respect are very great indeed. The obvious difficulty the objection, I
--mean which is always adduced by young men as a sufficient reason for not giving

up their time to scientific research is that it does not pay ; but it need scarcely be

said that the real difficulty is a more general one. It lies in that practical ten-

dency of the national mind which leads us Englishmen to rmderrate or depreciate

any kind of knowledge which does not minister directly to personal comfort or

advantage, a tendency which was embodied in the philosophy of Bacon, and has

been thought by some to constitute its great weakness. I have no doubt there

are as many in England as in Germany who would not be deterred by the prospect
of comparative poverty, .which in every coimtry must be the part of those who
devote themselves to abstract science ; but there are very few who have the courage

and resolution to follow this course in spite of a public opinion, which estimates

science on utilitarian principles.

  This leads me naturally to my second point, which is that the most efficient

means we can take to improve the position of our science in England are those

which have for their object the enlightenment of public opinion, and that this ia
to be eflected partly by diffusing this knowledge of our labours among the public,

and so inducing them to take an interest in them, partly by introducing training in

physical science into our schools.

In the art of exposition, i e. of making difficvilt subjects plain, we have oae
--148 KEPORT 1872.

--among us who is a master wliose powers in this respect have been acknowledged,

not only in England, but in France, and still more emphatically in Germany. His
work on elementary physiology has been presented to the German public by one of
the leading German physiologists (who is himself a model of clearness of style),

who tells his countrymen iu his preface that no German writer could expound

the experimental facts which are the basis of physiological knowledge aa

Huxley can.
   In the existence of such a man as Huxley I find a great source of encouragement

for the future of English physiology, not only on account of his own work, large
though that has been (for no one builder can lay many brides in an edifice

where every brick requires such careful laying), but also for his influence on

national life.

At one time I confess that I was disposed to underrate the value of popularizing
Wescience ; now T see the power of exposition to be a great power for good.

Wehave an example of the good it efiects in the history of this Association.  have

another in that of the lloyal Institution, which has lately been made familiar to

us by the accounts which liave been given of that great and good man who for so

many years was its life. Faraday, the gi-eatest physicist of his time, was equally

master of the art of exposition. Of the influence which his mind thereby exercised

on the minds of men, women, and children there can be no doubt. Nor do

I think that he lost by it himself; for although we cannot suppose that he taught

without some exhaustion of his energies, 1 cannot believe that the effort was a

useless one even to himself.

  One would not venture to say of such a man that, in explaining to children the

fundamental conceptions whicli in his mind were alreadj' so clear, these became

still clearer ; but I think it may be so.

myI pass at once to the third part of      position, that whicli relates to the

teaching of science, and particularly physiology, in schools. This I may dealAvith

Aery shortly.

The teaching must necessarily be elementary. If it is thorough and genuine,

it is good.

   To wedge a little bit of Bowdlerized physiology, something about the striicture
and functions of the human body, into the ordinaiy course of a school education
may be an ornamental addition to it, but can scarcely be really useful. Our
reform, if it is to be attempted at all, must be much more complete and radical.

It must consist, not in adding natural science to the sj'stem of instruction in which

we ourselves and our predecessors were brought up, but in substituting for some of

the old drudgeries something better and more substantial.

   As regards that higher education which may be defined as introductory to the
studies of the University, most people are now disposed to recognize that there

exists at the present day a tendency to increase its extent .at the expense of its

thoroughness. On the one hand a powerful effort is made by the huclatores

temporis adi to maintain the old disciplines ; while on the other a general though
somewhat vague notion prevails that no system of education can be regarded as
complete from which science is excluded. To reconcile these antagonistic ten-
dencies, the only method which has been found is that of addition and accumu-

lation. Instead of displacing some of the old requirements, an additional load of

new subjects has been imposed on the unfortunate examinee, in the form of
chemistry, physics, animal physiology, &c. No wonder that to the victim who

has just passed through one of our modern ordeals the A"ery names of these

sciences are sickening ; for in addition to the disagreeable task of getting them up

from text-books (text-books, however excellent, are at best but very poor

reading), the competitor, whether successful or not, has the consoling reflection

--that he has been doing treadmill work after all learning a number of facts and

laws of great value to the man who is able to possess himself of them, but to him

rendered absolutely useless from the mode of study to which the present system

of examinations has compelled him.

  The way to obviate this I have already hinted at. Let it be clearly understood
thatif natm-al science is to be made a part of our educational system, it cannot be

introduced as an ornamental addition or accomplishment, but as part of the ground-

work. To serve as a groundwork, M-e must admit that physiology and anatomy

are not adapted.

   The corner-stone must, of course, be mathematics. Side by side with mathe-

matics the subjects which ought to chaini preference are physics and chemistry.
The latter, when taught and studied experimentally, is specially fitted to cultivate

that certainty, that convincedness of mind, that clear realization of facts seen not
by the bodily but by the intellectual eye, which constitute the scientific spirit.

A boy who has learnt to feel the certainty of the laws of chemical combination

can never, so long as he retains his mental soundness, relapse into that state of

vague indifference about facts which characterizes many imeducated persons, or
lose the habit of exactitude of conception and statement to which he is compelled

by practice in chemical reasoning.
   It is clear that anatomy and physiology cannot be recommended on the same

ground yet I believe that it may be wisely included in ordinary education, not as
                                   ;

a discipline, and not as a subject of examination, but on tlie ground that it is so

usefully applicable to the common affairs of life. It is imdoubtedly useful that
every one should know something of the structure and functions of his own body

and this for several reasons : first, because he is enabled thereby to take better care

of himself, and to understand how to preserve himself by reasonable precautions

against some of tlie well-recognized causes of disease. Another reason is, he is

--thereby rendered not so liable as he would otherwise be to become the dupe of the

many quackeries which are afloat more ready to take the advice of the doctor as
regards the regulation of his mode of life, less credulous about the efHcacy of drugs.

   Let us now, in conclusion, say one word as to the influences which the general
adoption of a sj-stem based upon scientific training would exercise on scientific pro-
gress, and particularly on the progress of the science in which we are interested.

  WeI can illustrate this best by taking the medical student as an example.

teachers of physiology to medical students know that when we begin first to talk
to them about the principles of the subject (e. (/. about chemical change as the

essential condition of all vital phenomena, about the relation between the pro-

duction of heat and external motion, about the exchange of gases in respiration,

and many other fundamental subjects) the great difficulty is that our auditors are
utterly at fault for want of those conceptions about matter and its powers which
are expressed by the words we are constantly using, such as solid, liquid, gas,

vapour, weight, density, volume, &c.,allof which to the average finished schoolboy
are perfectly meaningless. The rssult is that these fundamental conceptions, not
having been mastered at first, are not mastered at all, and the student begins to build
the superstructure without having had any opportunity of laying the foundation.
If the Vorhilduiuj were different, if students were to come to their work with the
scientific habit of mind already formed, it would not only make tliem better
 students, but would retain its influence on them through life. The details might
 fade from the memory, but the spirit would remain.

    I trust that it will not appear to the members of the iSection that I have, in any
 of the observations I have made, forgotten that the object for which we are
 assembled here is the promotion of the science of anatomj' and physiology.
 Although I cannot claim for our science a more direct interest in scientific training

--than for others, there are reasons (as I have endeavoured to show) why it suffers

 more from the want of it than others the chief one being that, as compared
 with what we feel and know to be its real importance to the future welfare
 of humanity, the practical benefits which immediately arise from it are not -Ncry

 obvious.

    I have said very little indeed of another pressing difficulty which we have now

--and, I believe, will have for many years to contend with the want of pecuniaiy

 resources ; because I know that in this country if educated public opinion can be

 interested on behalf of any scientific object, and particularly if the intelligent
 classes of the community can be shown, on good ground, that the furtlierance of
 abstract science is a matter of vital importance to our national existence, the
 really trifling public expenditure which would be required to enable us to compete

 at least on equal terms with Germany, Austria, Bavaria, and Russia will at once be

forthcoming.
--150 REPORT 1872.

   In the mean time it is the function and duty of all who have the means and avo
interested in scientific progress, and especially of us, the members of this Section of
the British Association, to afford such aid as we can to those who, supported by
their own enthusiasm ratlier than by the prospect of honour or emolumeutj are

willing to devote their lives to physiological and anatomical researches.

On the Arrangement and Nomenclature of the Lobes of the Liver in Mammalia,
                            Bij Prof. W. H. Flower, F.E.S.

The descriptions of the livers of \'arious animals to be met with in treatises or

memoirs on comparative anatomj' are generally verj' difficult to understand for

want of a uniform system of nomenclature. The present communication, which

endeavours to supply such a system (and was illustrated at the Meetiui^ by a large

series of coloured diagrams), is based upon an examination of the condition of the

organ in examples of every important subdivision of the class. The difficulty

usually met with, arises from the circumstance of the liver being divided some-

times, as in man, ruminants, and the cetacea, into two main lobes, which have

alvv^ays been called respectively right and left ; and in other cases, as the lower

monkeys, carnivora, rodentia, &c., into a larger number of lobes. Among the

latter, the primarj' division usually appears at first sight to be tripartite, the whole
organ consisting of a middle, called " cystic " or " suspensory " lobe, and two

lateral lobes, called respectively right and left lobes. This introduces confusion in

describing livers by the same terms throughout the whole series of mammals, as

the right and left lobes of the monkey or dog, for instance, do not correspond with

the parts designated by the same names in man and the sheep. There are, more-

over, conditions in which neither the bipartite nor the tripartite system of nomen-

clature will answer, whicJi we should have considerable difficidty in describing

without some more general system.

It appears desirable to consider all livers as primarily divided by the iimbilical

vein into two segments, right and left. This corresponds with its development,

and with the condition characteristic of the organ in the inferior classes of

vertebrates. The position of this division can almost always be recognized in

adult animals by the persistence of some traces of the umbilical vein in the form of

the round ligament, and by the position of the suspensory ligament.

   "When the two main parts into whicli the liver is thus divided are entire, they

may be spoken of as the right and left lobes ; when fissured, as the right and left

segments of the liver, reserving the term lobe for the subdivisions. This ^^'ill

involve no ambiguity, for the terms right and left lobes \n\\ no longer be used for

divisions of the more complex form of liver.

In the large majority of mammals each segment is further divided by a fissure,

more or less deep, extending from the free towards the attached border, which

Whenthe author proposed to call rir/ht and left lateral fissures.  those are more deeply

cut than the umbilical fissure, the organ has that tripartite or trefoil-like form just

spoken of, the part between them being the so-called middle, cystic, or suspensory

lobe. These terms the author proposed to discontinue, and to institute rij/ht central

and left central for the two regions included between the mubilical and the two

lateral fissures, and to use riciht lateral and left lateral for the regions l)eyond the

lateral fissures. The essentially bipartite character of the organ, and the uni-

formity of its construction throughout the class, is thus not lost sight of, even in

the most complex forms.

The left segment of the liver is rarely complicated to any further extent, except

in some cases by minor or secondary fissures marking off small lobules, generally

inconstant and irregular, and never worthy of any special designation. The piin-

cipal differences to be noted depend on the degree of completeness of the lateral

fissures (which sometimes extend quite across the hepatic tissue, completelysevering

the left lateral lobe) and the relative size of the two lobes.

   On the other hand, the right segment is usually more complex. The right
lateral fissru'e when fully developed passes into the right extremity of the portal
                                                                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                       151

fissure. The riglit central lobe, therefore, on its under surface does not reach to

the attached border of the liver, but is alwaj's bounded in that direction by the

portal fissure. Moreover, the gall-bladder when present is always in relation to

its under surface. The position of this receptacle with respect to the lobe may

var}'; sometimes it is merely applied to its surface, loosely connected by con-

nective tissue ; in other cases it is deeply imbedded in a fossa. Very often it is

filaced near the middle of the lobe ; sometimes close to one or the other of its

 atoral boundaries. In many cases the fossa in which the gall-bladder is sunk is

continued to the free margin of the liver as an indent, or even a tolerably deep

fissure. This is called the cystic fissure ; but, in consequence of its irregularity

of position and frequent absence, it is not of the same importance as the other

fissures which have been named, and does not mark off any distinct divisions of

hepatic substance.

The right lateral lobe always has the great vena cava either grooving its surface

or tunnelling through its substance near the inner or left end of its attached border;

and a prolongation to the left, between the vein and the portal fissure, has long

been known under the name of the Spif/elian lobe. This is always a distinct

licpatic region, sometimes a mere narrow fiat track, but more often a prominent

tongue-shaped process. Whatever may be its form, it is bounded in front, or

towards                                   the     free      surface  of the liver,                                             by the  portal  fissure                                 on  the left  by the

joining part of the right lateral lobe.

The main body of the right lateral lobe is most commonly divided into two

parts, not by a cleft, such as the lateral fissures, passing from the upper to the

lower surface of the liver, but by one which severs a part off from the under

surface.                                          This  is  the  caudate  lobe                         and                     the  fissure which  separates it from                       tJie      right

lateral lobe may be called the " fissure of the caudate lobe." In man it is almost

(narrowest or attached end) to the Spigelian lobe, behind which isthmus the vena

cava is always in relation to it, channelling tiirough or grooving its surface. It

Tlio number of the heart's beats can be proved to depend on variations in the

resistance ofiered to the flow of blood through the small arteries, and not at all on

the blood-pressure. Poiseuillc showed that the flow of fluids through capillary

tubes varies directly as the pressure. From these facts it can be proved that to

maintain a uniform circulation, such as the systemic, it is essential that the capa-

city of the arterial system, including the heart, must vary directly as the blood-

pressure                                          and therefore it is necessary that the heart always recommences to beat
                                               ;

when the tension or pressure of the blood has fallen a certain invariable proportion,

and then only. The known variations in pulse-frequency in health are all

explicable on this supposition, for they can be proved to be caused by modifications

in the    arterial peripheral                                        resistance                                                thus  while standing the                                    body-wei<>-ht is

that the nutrition of the heart varies directly as the blood-pressure and as the

   Artijicicd Means. By Geoege Habkis, F.>S.A., Vice-Fresident of the

     Anthrojwioe/iccd Institute,

   The -writer, after throwing out a suggestion as to xshat a perfect system of
pathology might be expected to comprehend in a precise and complete knowledge
of the cause of each disease, and also the counteracting remedy to he applied for
its cure, proceeded to remark that corresponding questions arose with regard to
renovation and waste, as to whether the causes which affect them arc capahle of
control, although we are unacquainted with many of them, or whether they are

such as to be entirely beyond control. He adverted to the ascertained fixct of the

progress of renovation and waste in all animated frames, as also to the circumstance

that certain of these operations were known to he controllable. He analyzed the

principle of waste and decay in diti'erent bodies, both substantial and liquid, and
observed that the fact of bodies being animated did not exempt them from the
laws of nature. Extraordinary longevity had been attributed to certain wild
animals ; and it was remarkable tluit they were seldom found in a slate of de-
crepitude from old age. Savages derived from observation of wild animals the

medicinal properties of many plants and springs. Ossification of the bones and

deterioration of the blood had ueen considered bj' Buffon* and Smellef to be the
main causes of waste and decay in animated frames. The opinions of Galen, Willis,
Hunter, and other authorities, ancient and recejit, were cited. The writer then
proceeded to contend that, as the causes both of renovation and waste in certain

bodies are ascertained and are subject to control, these causes may be both ascer-
tained and subjected to control in many other cases also, if not universally, and

in frames which are animate as well as those which are inanimate. If you can
retard waste of the same natm-e with ossification, you can retard ossification also
and if you can retard ossification to a limited degree, according to our present
limited means and knowledge, when that means and knowledge hecome more ex-
tended, your power to control waste must necessarily be to a corresponding degree
extended as well. So also as regards the condition of the blood, and our control

over that condition. As science advances these causes may be better understood, and
the properties of various substances to control them at length perfectlj' ascertained.
He recommended experiments of various kinds as to the nature of substances and

their effect on bodies, animate as well as inanimate, and with regard to animals and
plants as well as man, as essential to solve this great problem satisfactorily.

      On the Mechanism of the Change of Colour in Fishes and Crustacea.
                                    By M. G. POTTCHET.

   As is already well known, the change of colour is due to the change in size of

contractile coloured cells placed in the skin. These are under the influence of
nerves. The author found that the particular neiTCS controlling them (in the

turbot) were nerves of the sympathetic. By cutting the nerve supplying a par-

ticular area of the skin, he had been enabled to retain that area unchanged in
colour, whilst the rest changed according as the fish found itself on a light or a dark
surface. That the eye is the means hy which the change in its conditions is com-
municated to the fish or crustacean, and that then a reflex action takes place, acting-
through the sympathetic nerves on the colour-cells of chromatophors, is proved by
the fact that when the animal experimented on is blinded, no further change of colour

occurs when it is removed from light to dark or dark to light surroundings.

% Oil the Graft Theory of Disease.
     James Eoss, M.D., Waterfoot, near Newehurch.

   The active part of viraleut fluids has been proved by the experiments of Prof.
Chauveau and those of Dr. ]3iirdon Sanderson to reside in particles not larg-er than

tl»<5 .ToJoo of 'i;! iiith in diameter. These particles are admitted to be living-; and

the question arises whether they form a race of independent beings like Bacteria,

or are merely modifications of the organism from which they have b'ecome detached.
The former view constitutes the basis of what is called the germ-theory of disease,

while the latter view is adopted here; and this constitutes at once the grounds and

the justification of the title--the Graft Theory of Disease, In the absence of

direct experimental evidence to decide between these different opinions, our only

alternative is to develop as much as possible the indirect evidence. On the sup-

position that the contagion particles are merely modified portions detached from

a living organism, there is a close similarity between them and the reproductive

Eai-ticles. Both sets of particles are merely modified epithelial cells ; they also
  ecome detached because the supply of nourishment fails them, and both are

characterized by being imspecialized. In the reproductive particles there is a
union between two particles detached or semidetached; but in the case of the

genesis of a contagious disease there is a union between a distinct individual and a

detached portion of another individual. In this respect, therefore, the analogy

fails. But the phenomena of vegetable grafting agree even in this respect with

those of the contagious diseases. Dr. Masters says that " cases have been observed

wliere from the stock below the graft fruits and flowers of the same appearance as
those borne on the scion have made their appearance." Again, Mr. Darwin savs

that " when the variegated jessamine is budded on tlie common kind the stock

sometimes produces buds bearing variegated leaves." This shows that the scion

attects the stock not only at the point of contact, but that it communicates to it a
chan.ge which manifests itself throughout the entire organism of the latter ; and

this is one of the most remarkable features of contagious diseases.

   But if virulent fluids are merely modifications of healthy tissues, the effects
produced by them upon another organism should correspond in certain leading

particLdars to those of other morbid tissues. If we compare the primary pustule in

inoculated smallpox yni\\ the pustule caused by tartar-emetic ointment, we shall

find that they go through a more or less smiilar evolution. An areola, or inflam-

matory ring, surrounds them, which is large and well-marked in the former, but

is also present in a minor degree in the latter. The former can be communicated

by inoculation to a healthy individual, but ordinary inflammation has also been
communicated in a similar manner. The lymphatic' glands in the Aicinity of the

smallpox-pustule become swelled, but this is only what occurs in the case of

almost all local diseases                                                                                           and the character of the  glandular affection always cor-
                                                                                                                 ;

responds with the local disease which has excited it. This is well seen in syphilis,
tubercle, and cancer. The lymphatic enlargement in smallpox, therefore, p"resents

no peculiarity which does not occur in other diseases ; but in other diseases, such as

pviemia, tubercle, and cancer, secondary aflectious occur in the lungs, liver and
internal organs generally. The secondary aftectiou in inoculated smallpox, how-

ever, takes place on the surface of the body. This is probably owing to the special

alfiuities of the tissues for special substances. It is also necessarv in all highly

contagious diseases that living particles should be detached in large numbers from

the body; hence secondary affections must occur in such diseases on either the

external or internal surface of the body, otherwise the disease would die out. The

fever is not, of course, peculiar to smallpox : it is alwavs an accompaniment of

rapid tissue changes; and the fever is higher in smallpox and the contagious

diseases generally, just because there is more rapid cell-nmltiplication througTiout

the body. Such changes mean an augmentation of the molecular forces devoted to
growth at the expense of those devoted to structure and function, and what is not

expended in the latter goes to the genesis of heat. But rapid cell-multiplication

involves other morphological changes : these are diminished bulk of units, disap-

pearance of cell-wall, and discontinuous growth; and such are proved to be the

characteristics of virulent fluids. Smallpo.x has, therefore, a close affinity with
                                                                                  ;

ment and this is equally true of the other zymotic diseases. On the other Iiand
                               ;

it might easily be shown that they have very little affinity with the true parasitic
diseases. All these considerations tend to show that the germ- theory is inapplicable
to the zymotic diseases.

The Cause of the Respiratory Variations of Arterial Pressure. By Dr. Bcr-

   DON Sanderson, F.R.S., Professor of Practical Physiology, University Col-
   lege, London.

The purpose of this paper was to show experimentally that the rhythmical

variations of arterial pressure, and of the frequency of the contractions of the heart,

which are normally associated with the respiratory movements, ma}' occur in the

absence of those movements, and that they cannot therefore be whollj' dependent

upon them. This is proved hy the observation that in animals which are gradually

subjected to the toxic action of curare while the variations of arterial pressure and

pulse-rate are continuously recorded on the kymograph, these variations persist

after the respiratory movements have ceased.

The experimental results which form the subject of this communication were

obtaiucftl by the author in the year 18G7. They are now published for the first time,
by way of supplement to certain recently published observations of Prof. Hering

on the subject.

The normal relation between the curve of arterial pressure and that of thoracic

expansion and contraction is now well known. In the dog each inspiratory act is

followed by an increase of arterial pressure with acceleration of the frequency of

the contractions of the heart. During the period of expiration, i. c. the interval
which separates one inspiration from its successor, the arterial pressure sinks and

the pulse becomes much less frequent. In both cases the phenomena relating to

the circulation always occur later than the corresponding respirator}' movements

so that, c. ff., the period of increase of arterial pressure and pulse-frequency always
begins and ends later than inspiration, coinciding usually in tbe dog with the latter

half or two thirds of the inspiratory act and the beginning of the act of expiration.
Hence the interval between each such period and its successor coincides with the

latter part of tbe expiratory period and the beginning of inspiration, i. e. begins a

little after each expiration and lasts after the beginning of each inspiration. In a

dog previously narcotized by morphia it is possible, by employing a very small dose

of curare, to arrest the respiratory movements by such slow degrees that the eilect

of their gradual cessation on the variations of arterial pressure maj' be watched in

all its stages. For this purpose it is necessary before injecting the curare to connect

the carotid or crural artery of the animal with the manometer of the kymograph,

and to record the respiratory movements simultaneously on the same cylinder in

such a way that the two tracings may be written one above the other, and that
their synchronous points may be always in the same vertical line. Tracings so

obtained corresponding to various stages in the action of the curare were exhibited.
The lirst showed the character of the arterial and respiratory curves, and their

relation to each other before any curare had been given. The second exhibited the
state of the circulation when the respiratory movements, although irregular, were
still vigorous. At the third period the respiratory movements had become very

shallow, and there was a distinct interv.al between inspiration and expiration : the
inspiratory eftbrt was then attended with a slight twitching of the external muscles

of the larynx, and expiration with a similar twitching of certain muscles of the limbs.

Finally, in the last tracing of the series it was seen that, although the eftect of the

expiratory effort was no longer perceptible, there was a slight jerk downwards of the

lever which represented inspiration.

Corresponding to these successive diminutions of respiratory movements, it was

seen that the variations of arterial pressure, although they diminished, did not dis-

appear.                                   Throughout the whole period of observation it was observed not only that

                                       _

the variations of pressure and pulse-rate continued, but that they preserved the

same relation precisely to the slight movements which represented inspiration and
--

expiration. After tlioso movenieuts liad entirely ceased tliey still preserved the
same character and rhythm.

   From the fact thus proved that the rliythmical variations of arterial pressure and

pulse-frequency persist in the curarized animal after the respiratory nio\ements have
ceased, the author concludes that these movements cannot be regarded as their
cause; and he regards them both as attributable to rhythmical motor impulses
originating from the medulla oblongata, iu which the tliree centres which preside
over the respiratory movements and those of the circulation alike participate, viz.

the centre of the cardiac vagus, the respiratory centre, and the vasomotor centre.

He supposes that with each period of increased activity of the inspiratory centre a

period of increased activity of the vasomotor centre coincides, and that both of these

centres act antagonistically to the centre of the cardiac vagus. Each rhythmical

excitation of the respiratory centre determines corresponding excitation of the
vasomotor centre, which manifests itself in increase of arterial pressure and suspen-
sion of the activity of the cardiac vagus.

   The author adheres to the conclusion arrived at from his previous experiments
(Phil. Trans. 18G8), that in the do^ the respiratory movements of the chest exercise
a considerable direc.-t and mechanical influence on the heart, and thereby on the

arterial pressure.

    Experiments relatinrj to the Coagulation oftlie Blood. By E. A. Schafer.

    In the course of a series of experiments upon the coagulability of frog's blood,
performed in the Physiological Laboratory of University College, the author

observed the following facts :

   The blood of the frog frequently exhibits, especially during the winter months,
but a very slight tendency to coagulate, so much so, that when drawn it not unfre-
quently remains completely liquid, with the exception of a film in immediate

contact with the sides of the glass vessel. On standing such blood soon separates

into two layers, the upper a clear plasma, the lower a mass of corpuscfes. If

undisturbed the blood may remain in this condition an indefinite time without

undergoing coagulation ; although if a little of the clear supernatant liquid be taken
up into a very fine glass tube it speedily solidifies, owing to the large relative
amount of surface to which it is exposed.

   In a few cases, on the other hand, the blood when drav\^l coagulates throughout.
If examined after a few hours it may appear as if coagulation had not occurred at
all, since we have the vessel filled, as before, with fluid blood separated into two

strata. In these cases, however, the clear supernatant liquid yields no further
coagulum in a tine glass tube, thus showing that it contains no fibrin in solutiouj

/. e. that it is scrum, not plasma ; besides, the contracted remains of the clot may
always be found. The appearance of reliquefaction of the blood here presented is

due entirely to the astonishing amount of contraction which the fibrin undergoes,
the result of this contraction being that not only the serum but even the corpuscles
themselves are expressed from its meshes*.

   That the diminution iu bulk of the clot (whicli may proceed to such an extent as

to leave but a slight trace) is due to this cause only, and not to a reliquefaction of

fibrin, as v. Recklinghausen supposed, is shown by the fact that when the primary
coagulation is complete no further coagulum is obtainable from the serum, even

under the most favourable circumstances.

   But there is a source of error to guard ao-ainst. The blood may appear to have
coagulatedthroughout, when all the while its central portions may not have par-

ticipated ; indeed this occurs in the majority of cases. It is easy to see that, under

such circumstances, when the fibrin contracts the serum which is expressed will
have mixed with it a greater or less amoimt of liquor sanguinis, and hence v>-ill be

found to be coagulable.

   * This process may readily be observed inicroscopically as it occurs in a very thin-
walled capillary tube. An immersion objective should "be used for the purpose of

observation.

                             Bi/ Prof. Strtttheus, M.D., of Aberdeen.

   The author showed dissections of this part in several animals. An arch of bone

is thrown, like a bridge, over the great nerve, and generally also the great artery

of the limb, a little above the elbow, protecting them from pressure and injury. No
such structure exists normally in the human arm, but it occurs occasionally a=i a
variation. When it exists, the process grows from exactly the same spot as in

animals which possess it, and the arch is completed b}' a ligament, the nerve and
generally also the artery passing under the arch. This variety had attracted
some notice lately, and is supposed to be very rare; but the author has fouud it

often, and he exhibited a large number of speciiueas of it from the human arm, in
its various degrees of development. lie had also met with it occasionally in the

living body, and had lately been able to prove the correctness of his previous sup-

position that it may be hereditary, having met with it in the members of a family',
in the father and in four sons. The author remarked on the great interest attach-

ing to this vai'iation. In animals which possess it, it is wliat, in olden phra-
seology, would be called a contrivance specially designed for the protection of the

nerve in them. But why should the same contrivance occur as a variety in man ?
The old ai'giiment from final cause, and no less its successor the theory of" type," be-

sides being metaphj'sical, become untenable in the face of the existence of these rudi-
mentary structures. The theory of so-called type has a great deal to answer for

in obscuring the natural interpretation. If species are of independent origin, how

comes it that animals have in their bodies parts of other animals, parts which are

of no use to them, sometimes even dangerous to them ? To those who are able to

overcome the prejudices of their early education, the evidence comes with irresistible

force in support of the hj'pothesis of the origin of species by evolution.

    On the Sternum and Pelvic Bone in the IVujht Whale and in Great Fin-

                         Whales. By Prof. Strutrers, M.D.

   The sternum exhibited showed a very different form from that of the same species
of Fin-Whale which Prof Struthers had brought under the notice of the Associa-
tion last year. Instead of a single median cervical process, it has a deep median
notch with a broad crest on each side, and the posterior process is very narrow.

Two sterna of the Greenland Right Whale exhibited were large. The author

divides the sternum into three parts. The middle, between the first ribs, is thick,
completing the thoracic girdle, and essential ; the part in front of this and the
part behind it vary greatly, being more or less rudimentary. The sternum of the
Finner has two joints with the first rib, that of tlm liiglit Whale only one joint;
and this difference in the thoracic adaptation, together with the great breadth of
the first rib in the Right Whale, might explain the very different forms presented
by this bone in these two kinds of whales.

   One of these breast-bones exhibited marks of former inflammation of the bones.
The author inentioned that he had often met with this condition in whales ; in some
cases ankylosis of tlie vertebras had resulted, .and in some there must have been
considerable suffering to the animal. This fact might be commended to the notice
of those, if there be yet any such, who have the notion that disease occurs in animals
only when they come under the influence of man.

fino;er-muscles in the gi-eat Fin-Wliale, first noticed by Prof. Flower. It liacl been
believed that these muscles do not exist in the toothed whales ; but in this bottle-

nose they were even better developed than in the Finner. The extensor muscles

especially were better marked, the external extensor, corresponding to the so-called

extensor of the little finger of man, being also present. An extensor carpi radialis

was also present. Besides the muscles which are known to exist at the shoulder
and arm in the Cetacea, he found a representative of the biceps present here. These
muscles were mainly to be regarded as rudimentary, but they had a certain low
amount of function by which their presence as muscles is maintained. In some
other cetaceans they are represented entirely by fibrous tissue. Prof, gtruthevs
exhibited also a dissection of the rudimentary teeth concealed in the gum of this

bottle-nose. These teeth are alive, but useless, and their presence could be rea-
sonably interpreted only by the hypothesis of evolution.

       Anthbopology.

       Address to the Department of Anthrojyologi/.

        Bij Colonel A. Lane Fox., F.G.S., F.S.A.

When the Council of this Association did me the honour of naming me one of the

Vice-Presidents for this Section, and the duty of opening the proceedings of this

Department was committed to my'charge, I had before me two alternatives, which,

I suppose, must have suggested themselves to most of those who have occupied the

Chair which I so unworthily fill upon the present occasion. I had to consider

whether I should prepare a communication upon some special branch of study to

which I had devoted my attention, or taking a broader and more general view of

anthropological science as a whole, I should endeavour to oiTer a few remarks which

might be useful in clearing the ground for the valuable and interesting papers which

will be presented to you in the com-se of the session.

In partly adopting the latter or more general course, which I may say is the one

mythat is least congenial to me, on account of  conscious inability to deal satisfac-

torily with so large a subject, and also because I think that in the present state of

our knowledge we are better employed in collecting evidence than in generalizing,

I have been influenced chiefly by a consideration of the many and great defects

--which have been acknowledged to exist in our method of proceeding in this depart-

ment of science defects which are, I believe, the natural concomitants of the early

stage of development through which we are passing, but which we must set om*
faces seriously to encounter before we can hope that anthropology will be faii-ly

admitted into the brotherhood of the established sciences which are recognized

under the auspices of this Association.

  When towards tlie conclusion of the last Meeting at Edinburgh one of the ladies

present drew attention to the generally unscientific character of the papers which

had been read, she, I believe, said no more than was strictly applicable, not only to

that particular Meeting, but to upwards of two thirds of the papers which are in-

cluded under the head of anthropology elsewhere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and here  I  may observe that if
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

no other benefit were recognized from the participation of the other sex in our dis-

cussions, we should find in it a som-ce from which home truths of this nature can

emanate without their setting our backs up. In making these remarks I am con-
scious that I am hafting the lash which may perhaps with some justice be applied to

your Chairman on the present occasion. 1 cannot, however, claim any special ex-

emption, but must share with my brother anthropologists any censure which may

be justly due to our shortcomings.

The ladies must not, however, be too severe upon us in this department, but

must make allowance for the empiricism which is naturally attendant upon a new

study ; for the anthropology of to-day bears, I believe, about the same relationship

to the anthropology of the futm-e that alchemy and astrology did to the chemistry

and astronomy of our own times. We have established none of the landmarks,

the classifications, or the nomenclature which in other sciences serve to keep the

discussions witliiu bounds, and direct the thoughts of the workers into useful chan-

nels. Antliropology is such a vast field of study, it is so impossible for any single

mind to comprehend the whole with the precision that is necessary for scientific

purposes, that it demands more than any other the subdivisions that are recognized

in the sister sciences, but which at the present time are absent in ours. Hence the

random range of om* discussions ; each speaker naturally wanders into the path that

is most familiar to him, and there is no sulEcient discipline to bring him back into

the line of march.

Moreover, in dealing with anthropological subjects we are met with difficulties

arising from their closeness relatively to ourselves. The same impediment which

we have to work are drawn from the reservoir of human thoughts and actions, we

cannot disengage ourselves sufficiently to take a comprehensive view of the subjects

we are stud3'ing. I presume that even the ablest amongst us must labour under a

Wesense of incapacity in dealing with anthropological speciilatious.                                                                                                                                                                                                    may be said

to stand in the position of molecules of paint upon the surface of a picture striving

to catch the artist's design. Is it sm-prising there shoidd be confusion of tongues

in such a Babel as we are building ?

Since, then, our anthropological field of vision is so extremely limited, it behoves

VIS all the more in this branch of study to concern ourselves with the arrangement

of our subdivisions, in order that they may bear an harmonious relation to each other,

and whilst gi^nng fidl vent to individual thought and action, and limiting the sphere

of inquiry in each branch to such matters as may fall within the easy grasp of finite
minds, they may at the same time be rendered subordinate to those great general

objects which it is the intention of anthropological science to serve; for it cannot

be proclaimed too often that in this country and in this Association we have not

adopted the term antlirupology out of deference to any particular dogmas or sets of

opinions, or out of regard for any particular party or society, but because that term

appears to be etymologicallj^ the most accurate for embracing the whole of those

many studies which are included in the science of num. As one of those who for

some years past have taken part in those practical mea.sures which have been as yet

only partially and feebly instrumental in promoting the union of the anthropological

sciences, it occurs to me that the present occasion may be a fitting one for express-

ing some of the views which have suggested themselves to me in the course of my

experience whilst so engaged. I propose, therefore, after considering briefly the

existing phases of one or two of the more important questions with which anthro-

pology has to deal, and saying a few words on the relative value of certain classes

of evidence, to speak of the anomalies and misadj ustments in what may be called

the machinery of anthropological science, defects in the existing constitution of

some of the societies which either are or ought to be included amongst the branches

of our great subject. In the remarks which I shall oft'er upon this subject it is not

my wish that any undue weight should attach to the particular suggestions which
I may be called upon to make as in any way emanating from this chair. My object

is rather to draw the attention of anthropologists to the urgent necessity which exists

for better organization than to propound any particular schemes of my own ; indeed,

so rapidly do our views change in the infancj' of a science, that I should be sorry to

bind myself over  to accept many of my own opinions a                                                                                                                                                                                                                   couple of years hence                                                                                                     for

there is, perhaps, no branch of study to which we may more truly apply the dictum

of Faraday, that " the only man who ought really to be looked upon as contemptible

is the man whose ideas are not in a constant state of transition.

   Amongst the questions which anthropology has to deal with, that of the descent of
man has been so elaborately treated, and at the same time popularized by Mr. Bai-win,

that it would be serving no useful purpose were I to allude to any of the arguments

on which he has based his belief in the unbroken continuity of man's development

fi'om the lower forms of life. Nor is it necessai-y for one to discuss the question

of the monogenesis or poli/ffettesis of man. On this subject also Mr. Darwin has
shown how unlikely it is that races so closely resembling each other, both physi-

callv and mentallv, and interbreeding as thev invariablv do, should on the theorv

 of development have originated independently in different localities. Neither are

 we now, I think, in a position to doubt that civilization has been gradually and

 progressively developed, and that a very extended, though not by any means
 uniform, period of growth must have elapsed before we could arrive at the high

 state of culture which we now enjoy. The arguments of our sectional President,

 Sir John Lubbock, on this subject may, I think, be accepted generally as those of

 the best exponent of these views in our own time ; such was the opinion, as we

 learn from various authorities, that was held by most of the ancient authors, and

 it tallies in all respects with the phenomena of progress now observable in the

 world around us, or which have been recorded in history. Indeed it almost

 appears probable that had it not been for certain dogmas inculcated in our youth,

 and from the iutiueuce of which in biasing our iudgment it is difficult to disenorao:e

 ourselves in after years, we should never for a moment have thought it possible

 that civilization could have arisen through any other causes than those by which
 we actually see it developing in our own times.

    IIow far the first beings worthy of being called men may have possessed superior

 organic psychical powers to their predecessors, and whether the superior functions

 of the human mind were developed slowly or rapidly is a point on which it is more
 difficult to form an opinion. In contrasting the psychical differences between man

 and the lower animals, it is so invariably the practice to include, and indeed so impos-

 sible to avoid including, in our estimate of the human intellect all that conscious

 education and unconscious infantile culture has added to the powers of the mind,

that unless we were able to try the experiment of the Egyptian king, and send
children to be brought up with animals apart from all intercourse with the human
race, we could not place ourselves in a position to compare truly the innate capacities

 of the two, or to form any just estimate of the difficulties which primteval man,
even supposing him to have possessed mental powers equal to our own, must have
encountered in the first stages of human culture. It has been shown by Prof.

Huxley and others that there is really no cerebral barrier between men and animals

nor does it appear beyond the pale of possibility that a slight increase in the vivid-
ness or permanence of the impressions of external objects upon the mind over that
possessed by the brutes, might, by marking more clearly the sequence of events,

be sufficient to initiate that faculty for improvement which is the special charac-
teristic of man.

   Be that as it may, there is, I believe, nothing in the constitution of our own
minds which can lead us to doubt that the progress of our first parents must have

been extremely slow, or that the slight improvement observable in the implements

of the neolithic over those of the palaeolithic age did actually correspond to the

continuous progression of human culture during enormous periods of time.
   Now, if it is true that during the countless ages included in the palaeolithic and

neolithic periods (which we know to have been marked by great geological changes,
by the union and separation of great continents, by great changes of climate, and
by the migration of various classes of fauna into distant parts of the earth) the
progress of mankind was as slow and gradual as we are warranted in supposing it
to have been by the relics which have been left us, considering how short the
period of history during which the rapid development of civilization has taken
place is in comparison with the long periods of time of which we have been
speaking, and that progress is always advancing at a rapidly increasing ratio, we
need find no difficulty in supposing that where savages are now found in the
employment of implements corresponding to those of the neolithic age, they pre-

sent us with fairly correct pictures of neolithic culture, being really in point of
time only a little behind us in the race of improvement. It is reasonable also to
suppose that the use of such tools by savages, and the culture associated with
them, was also, like that of our neolithic parents, inherited from lower conditions
of life, and that, being slow and continuous, it was sufficiently stable to enable us

to trace connexions between people in the same stage now widely separated, and
between them and oiu- own neolitJiic ancestors.

   The most remarkable analogies are in reality found to exist between races in the
same condition of progress ; and it is to the study of these analogies, wiih the view
of ascertaining their causes and histories, that the attention of anthronologists has

                                                                                                  12*

of late been especially drawn; and on this subject I propose to make a few ob-

servations.

   There are two ways in which it has been attempted to account for these ana-
logous coincidences : one by the hypothesis of inheritance, to which I have already
referred ; the other by the view of the independent origin of culture in distant
centres, assimilated in consequence of the similitude of the conditions under which

it arose. It is said that the wants of man being identical, and the means of sup-

plying those wants by external nature being alike, like causes would produce like
effects in many cases. There can be little doubt that many remarkable analogies

have arisen in this manner, especially amongst the very variable myths, customs,
religions, and even languages of savage races, and that it would be dangerous to
assume connexion to have existed except in cases where a continuous distribution

of like arts can be traced. On the other hand, we should commit a gi-ave error if

we were to assume the hypothesis of independent origin, because no connexion is
found to exist at the present time ; for we are as yet almost entirely ignorant of the
archaeology of savage and barbarous races. It is but fifteen years since we began
to study the prehistoric archaeology of our own race, which has ah-eady carried us
so far on the road towards connecting us with savages ; and can we say what
further connexions may be brought to light when the nver-drifts of such rivers as
the Niger or the Amazons come to be studied ? Nor can it fairly be said that the
wants of mankind are alike in all cases ; for if we adopt the principle of evolution,

it is evident that the wants of man must have varied in each successive stage of pro-

gress, diminished culture being associated with reduced wants, thus carrying us back

to a condition of man in which, being analogous to the brutes, he could scarcely be

said to have any wants at all of an intellectual or progressive character.

   It would be an error to apply either of these principles exclusively to the inter-

pretation of the phenomena of civilization. In considering the origin of species, we

are under the necessity of allying ourselves either on the side of the monogenists or

maythat of the 2}ol!/ffi')iists ; but in speaking of the origin of culture, both principles

be, and undoubtedly are, applicable. There is, in fact, no royal road to knowledge on

this subject by the application of general principles ; the history of each art,

custom, or institution must be diligently worked out by itself, availing ourselves

of the clue afforded by race as only the most probable channel of communication

Weand development.  may be certain, however, that in all cases culture was con-

tinuously and slowly developed. Wherever we find an art or institution in an ad-

vanced or a conventionalized state, we may be certain that it did not originate and

was not invented in that condition, but was the result of slow growth ; and if the

evidence of such growth is wanting in the locality, or amongst the people with

whom it exists, it is rational to look for it elsewhere. Where, on the other hand,

the arts are in a low stage of development, closely allied to each other in their

objects, forms, or appliances, and largely dependent on the unaltered productions of

nature, we may assume that they are indigenous.

   There is but one existing race the habits of which are sufficiently well known,

which can be said to present in any great degree the characteristics of a primaeval
people, and that is the Australians. As I have elsewhere noticed, all the weapons
and tools of the Australians, whatever the uses to which they are applied, are
closely allied to each other in form. The spear, the club, the malga, the boomerang,
and the heileman, or rudimentary shield, all pass into each other by subvarieties and

connecting links, and all consist of the but slightly modified natural forms of the

stems of trees and other natural productions. The Australian in his arts corresponds

the most closely of any people now living to those of the palaeolithic age. His stone

axe is sometimes held in the hand when used, and, like the palaeolithic man, he has

not yet conceived the idea of boring a hole through it for the insertion of a handle.

In some cases he cannot without instruction even understand the use of such a hole

Awhen he sees it in the axes of European manufacture.  most remarkable instance

of this was brought to my notice not long ago by Mr. Grimaldi, who found on the

site of a deserted native camping-ground a European axe having a hole for the
handle, which the natives, unaole to conceive the use of this part, had filled up with

gum, and hafted by means of a withy bent round the outside of the hole, in
accordance with their traditional custom. Through the kindness of the owner, I

with Jiiuropean materials.

     Now it has been shown in some cases ; and here I especially refer to the account
lat^ely published by Mrs. MiUet, of the Native School established, under conditions
only partially favom'able to its success, in the interior of Western AustraUa*. The
Australians are found in some cases to be not only capable, but even quick in re-
ceiving instruction. It IS evident, therefore, that we should be wi'ong if we were to
attribute the extraordinary retardation of culture on the Australian continent to
racial incapacity alone
                                                                                                                          ;  racial incapacity is one item, but not the only item to be con-

sidered in studying the development of culture.

objection which has been made to my including these weapons under the same class,
VIZ. that the Dravidian boomerang does not return like the Australian weapon."
I he return flight is not a matter of such primary importance as to constitute a
generic diiierence, if 1 may use the expression : the utility of the return flio-ht has
been gjeatly exaggerated

mness ot the Australian weapon. All who have witnessed its employment bv the
natives concur       saying that                                                                                              it has a random            range in its return  flight. Anv    one

stick of the same size with accuracy. I also succeeded in at last obtaining a return
mflight, so that the weapon, alter flying seventy paces forward, returned to within

seven paces of the position which I was standing. This settles the question of

Implements characteristic of tlie neolitliic stage of culture have been found in

all parts of the world, and the identity of their forms in regions remote from one

another has attracted the notice of archfeologists. By degrees some of the most

primitive weapons would be superseded by others, and the improved forms would

be rapidly disseminated. Community of goods, which is characteristic of a primi-

tive state of society, would be a means of disseminating these improvements far

more rapidly than afterwards, when the idea of personal property had been intro-

duced, and before trade had been establislied. It has been found that in Western

Australia, where no individual is able long to retain any thing as his own, and

where members of another tribe are supposed to have a special claim on the pos-

sessions of an individual, this custom has been the means of conveying articles of

European manufacture far inland into districts where the white man is unknown.

We have also proof, in the migration of the Malays into Madagascar and the

spread of the Polynesian race over the Pacific Ocean, that oceanic boundaries are

not sufficient to prevent intercoinmunication between distant countries, and that

intercourse between people in a comparatively low state of culture must frequently

have taken place in prehistoric times. The earliest improvements would thus in

time become the most widely disseminated, and therefore the most difficult to trace

by their distribution at the present time.

Amongst the earliest improvements upon the primitive arts of man would be the

substitution of the throwing-stick by the bow as a means of accelerating the flight

and force of the javelin. So decided an advance in the employment of missile force

would lead to the discontinuance of the throwing-stick for ordinary' purposes

wherever the bow was introduced. The throwing-stick is now found onh' in

distant and unconnected regions, viz. in Australia, amongst the Esquimaux and the

Purus Purus Indians of South America ; and it has been assumed, on account of

the isolated positions in which it is found, that it must be indigenous. On the

other hand, the use of the bow is almost universal ; and it has equally been assumed,

on account of its world-wide distribution, that it must be indigenous in ditl'erent

localities, and not derived from a common centre. GeogTaphical distribution, how-

ever, although affording the best evidence obtainable, cannot be relied upon with

certainty in the case of so early an invention as the bow appears to have been.

I cannot concur in thinking that we have any sure evidence that the bow originated

in different places                                                                                   on the contrary, what evidence we have appears to me to be of
                                                                                                   ;

a contrary tendency.

In tropical and temperate regions the elastic properties of wood and its appli-

cability to the purposes of offence would force itself upon the notice of the aboriginal

man as he pushed his way through the underwood of the prinifeval forest. He

would perceive that by tying his lance to the end of an elastic stem, and by a simple

contrivance for retaining it in a bent position until the proper time arrived for

releasing the spring, it might be made to pierce other animals as they passed

through  the wood                                                                                     hence  the  spring-lance  or  trap, which we  find widely distri-
                                                              ;

buted in parts of Africa and Southern Asia, and which in later years has been

carried by the negroes into South America. By degrees he would see that, with

the addition of a string, the trap might be made to project the lance witli great

force and accuracy ; and the power thus afforded of wounding a wild animal or an

enemy at a distance would at once commend it to his adi^ption. Where suitable

spring wood existed, the construction of the bow was simple enough ; but when the
use of this weapon penetrated into northern climes, where an arctic flora did not

supply wood of sufficient elasticity for the purpose, it would become necessary to

supplement the stiff pine-wood or bone by some suitable material. It would be

found that the sinews of animals fastened along the back would supply the elasticity

that was wanting. By this means he would be led to the use of the composite

Abow, which is the bow peculiar to the northern hemisphere.                                                                                         comparison of the

modern I'ersian composite bow with those figured on the Greek vases proves that

this was the form of bow used by the Scythians and others in ancient times. In

I^apland we find the same form. It wns carried by the northern immigrants into

India, but it is not indigenous in that country. By the Tartars it was introduced
Weinto China.
               find it also on the east coast of Siberia. Across Behring Strait it

reappears amongst the Esquimaux in its most primitive form ; but the returns at
                                                                       ;

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                          163

the ends prove it to be unmistakably the same weapon as the Tartar bow. It is
found also in British Columbia, and down the west coast of America as far as

California.

   Here, then, we have the continuous distribution across two entire continents of

a particular class of bow, of a more complex form than the southern bow, and one,

therefore, which is not likely to have been adopted except by a people to whom the
simpler but equally effective form was known, but who did not possess the mate-

rials necessary for its construction. It would not, perhaps, require a very wide

stretch of imagination to suppose that this class of bow may have originated at a
time when an arctic flora similar to that existing amongst the Esquimaux may

have been more widely distributed in the northern hemisphere than at present, and
its advantages for emjiloyment on horseback would be a cause for retaining it. Be

that as it may, we have proof that this composite bow is of great antiquity, and that
it has been carried by intruding races into distant countries. May not the use of
the simpler and earlier bow have been spread in the same manner ? It may have
been, but we cannot say that it was. The resemblance between the South-Ame-

rican bows and arrows and those from New Guinea is so close that it is sometimes

difficult to distinguish them. Even the ornamentation upon them is much alike
and it is well known to all Prehistorians that the arrow-heads found on the Ame-

rican continent present all the four tj-pes of leaf-shaped, lozenge-shaped, triangular,

and barbed, that are found in Europe.

As by degrees the use of the bow spread over the world, that of the throwing-

Westick would tend to disappear.  have some gTOunds for supposing that the latter

instrument was fonnerly in use in the Pelew Islands ; and Mr. Franks has found it

amongst some Mexican relics probably preserved in a tomb. May it not also have

existed formerly in other localities where it has not been preserved in tombs, and

where no trace of it now exists ? If this were the case, where should we now

expect to iind it retained ? In such localities as the Arctic seas, where lack of

suitable materials still renders the construction of the bow a work of great diffi-

culty, as is shown by the manner in which several pieces of hard bone are some-
times fastened together to form one, or in Australia, where the knowledge of the

use of tlie bow has never penetrated.
   Closely connected with the bow, the harpoon may be instanced as an example of

early origin and wide distribution. The harpoon is found in some of the French
caves, amongst the earliest bone relics of human workmanship that have been

brought to light. Its present distribution is almost universal, being found in

Australia, North and South Africa, North and South America, and in all regions

where its use has not been superseded by more suitable contrivances.

    In proportion as our investigations are carried into the higher phases of civili-

zation, we find our areas of distribution more limited, and of more and more value
to us is tracing the continuity of culture ; and when we come to the distribution of
the metallurgic arts, we find tliem defined by marked geographical boundaries

which are not the boundaries of the great primiBval races of mankind.

If we draw a line across the globe from Behring Strait in a south-westerly direction

through Wallace's line, leaving Australia on the east, and take for our period the

date of the first discovery of America, we shall find that (putting aside the metal-
ku'gic culture of Mexico and Peru, which, it may be observed, is grouped round a

single centre) this line separates the area of stone culture on the east from the

area of metallurgic culture on the west ; but it passes straight through the prim^-eval

racial boundai-ies. Turning to the ethnological map of the world, we find in the
southern hemisphere the black races of man occupvdng a continuous area, extending

from Australia on the east to Africa on the west ; of these, the eastern portion are
in the area of stone culture, whilst the western ha^·e long become acquainted with

the use of metals. Or if we divide these black races, as Prof Huxley has divided

them, into Australoid and Negroid stocks, including amongst the 1 itter the Negritos,

we find equally that with each of these primteval stocks the eastern half are in the

stone area, while the western are acquainted with the use of metals. In the

northern hemisphere we also find the great Mongoloid stock, which includes the

inhabitants of northern and eastern Asia and the two continents of America, divided

by our line in two portions, of which the eastern are in the stone area, while the
164 REPORT--1872.

western have made considerable advance in metallurgic culture. Here, then, we
see that the distribution of the metallurgic art had, at the time we speak ot^ spread

over three continents, and been brought to a stand by gi-eat oceanic boundaries,

beyond which it had not penetrated, unless, indeed, it had been carried by some

vessel to the coast of Peru.

  If we now take what we may call the metallurgic area more in detail, and endeavour
to trace the distribution of the implements of the bronze period, we find that the same

class of weapons and tools extends over a continuous area, including the whole of

the northern, western, and central parts of Europe, as far as Siberia on the east ; these

implements, including palstaves, leaf-shaped swords, and socket celts, with the moulds

for casting them, are of a character to prove that the diffusion of the bronze culture

throughout this area must have been connected and continuous. In Egypt, Assyria,

India, and China we have  also bronze                                             but the forms of the implements do not,  as
                                                                               ;

a rule, correspond to those of the area above mentioned : our knowledge of the

bronze weapons of India and China is, however, extremely limited as yet. I have

elsewhere given my reasons for believing that the knowledge of the use of iron in

Africa must have been derived from a common centre ; not only is the mode of

working it the same throughout that continent and in India, but the forms of the

weapons fabricated in this metal, and especially the corrugated blades, are the same

in every part, and appear to have been copied and retained through habit where-

ever the use of iron has penetrated. I have lately traced this peculiar form of blade

in several parts of the Indian peninsula and Burniah, and I have no doubt it wiU

eventually be found further to the north, so as to connect the area of its distribution

continuously with those of the same identical construction that are found in the

Saxon and Prankish graves.

The distribution of megalithic monuments extends in a continuous belt, as has

been repeatedly shown, from western Europe to eastern and southern India ; and

however little disposed some of us may be to agree with Mr. Fergusson as to the
age to which he refers these monimients, for my part I concur with him in thinking

that their distribution denotes intercommunication on the part of the constructors

of them. The art of enamelling, which was known to the Celts and Eomans, as

well as to the Chinese, will, I have no doubt, be .shown hereafter to have been de-

rived from the east, or at least to have spread from a single source. It is worthy

of notice that the present distribution of filigree work, which is closely connected

with enamelling, and which may be regarded as a survival of that antique art, is
now found to be practised in a continuous belt fi-om China on the east to Spain on

the west ; and with the exception of some rough Scandinavian work of the same

character, it is not, I believe, found out of this channel. This, indeed, appears to

have been the high road of communication in non-historic times, and indicates the

route through which many of the so-called eai'ly European discoveries may have

been derived.

I have thus briefly alluded to the distribution of some of the arts associated with

early culture, with the view of showing that as our knowledge increases we may

expect to be able to trace many connexions that we are now ignorant of, and that
we should be careful how we too readily assume, in accordance -ndth the theorj' which

'appears popular among anthropologists at the present time, that coincidences in the

culture of people in distant regions must invariably have originated independently

because no evidence of communication is observable at the present time. Owing,

perhaps, to a praiseworthy desire to refute the arguments of Archbishop Whately
and others, who have erroneously, as I think, assumed that because no race of
existing savages has been known to elevate itself in the scale of civilization, therefore

the first steps in culture must have resulted from supernatural revelation, we have
now had a run upon the theory of what may be called the spontaneous generation

of culture ; and the pages of travel have been ransacked to find examples of inde-

pendent origin and progress in the arts and customs of savage tribes. Owing to
this cause, we have, I think, lost sight in a great measure of tlie important fact
which history reveals to us, that, account for it as we may (and it is one of the gi-eat
problems of Anthropology to account for it if we can), the civilization of the world

has always advanced by means of a leading shoot ; and though constantly shifting
its area, it has within historic times invariably grouped itself round a single centre.

from which the arts have been disseminated into distant lands or handed down to

posterity. In all cases a continuous development must be traced before the problem

of origin can be considered solved ; the development may have been slow or it may

have been rapid, but the sequence of ideas must have been continuous, and until that

sequence is established our knowledge is at fault. As with the distribution of
plants, certain soils are favom-able to the growth of certain plants, but we do not

on that account assume them to be spontaneous offspring of the soil, so certain arts

and phases of culture may flourish among certain races or under certain conditions

of life. But it is as certain that each art, custom, and institution had its history of

natural growth ; it is that each seed which sprouts in the soil once fell from a parent

stem. The human intellect is the soil in which the arts and sciences may be said

to grow ; and this is the only condition of things compatible with the existence of

minds capable of adapting external nature, but possessing no power of originality.

  If I am right in supposing that it is one of the primary objects of Anthropological

Science to trace out the history and som-ces of human cidture, a consideration of the

relative value of the various classes of evidence on which we rely for this pui-pose

will be admitted to be a question of no slight importance in connexion with our sub-

Weject.  must distinguish between those branches of study which we are apt to look

upon as intrinsically the highest, and on that account the most attractive, and those

which are of most value as evidence of man in a low condition of culture. To the re-

ligions, myths, institutions, and language of a people we are naturally drawn, as af-

fording the best indications of their mental endowments ; but it is evident that these
carry us no further bacJi in time than the historic period; and however necessai-y to be

studied as branches of our science, they fail to anord us any direct evidence of those

vast ages during which our species appears to have gradually taken upon itself the

characteristics of humanity : every age has, however, left us the relics of its material

arts, which, when studied comprehensively in connexion with the geological record,

may be taken as evidence of mental development from the earliest period of time.

Nor is it in point of time alone, but also by reason of their stability, that the material

ails afford us the surest evidence on which to reconstruct om- social edifice. The

tendency to constant variation within narrow limits is a psychical characteristic of

the uncultivated  man                      but  the  material  arts  are  not subject to  those comparatively
                                        ;

abrupt changes to which, prior to the introduction of writing, all branches of culture

are liable which are dependent for their transmissions on the memory, and which

are communicated by word of mouth.

  Few who liave read the works of Prof Max Mliller or Mr. Fan-ar can fail to be

struck witli the value of the evidence afibrded by language, so far as it goes, but, on

the other hand, with the very short distance to which it carries us back in investiga-

ting the origin of speech ; nor is this surprising when it is considered how constant

must have been the changes to which language was subject in prehistoric times.

Amongst the one hundred islands occupied by the Melanesian race, the Bishop of

Wellington informs us there are no less than two hundred languages, dift'ering fi-om

each other as much as Dutch and German ; and this diversity of languages and dia-

lects is confirmed by Mr. Turner, in his account of his nineteen years' residence in

Polynesia. Amongst the Penons, or savage tribes of Cambodia, we read of the great

number of dialects spolven by tribes whose manners and customs are the same.

Amongst the Musgu of Central Afi-ica, Barth tells us that, owing to the absence of

friendly intercourse between the several tribes and families, such a number of dialects

had sprung up as to render communication between them difficult. Upon the river

Amazon Mr. Bates mentions that in a single canoe he found several individuals

speaking languages so difierent as to be imintelligible to the others. In a state of

culture in which such diversity of tongues existed, what could have been the

chance of preserving unchanged the myths, religions, and all those manifestations

of intellect which are dependent on tradition ? It has, in fact, been found, by

those most competent to judge, that they are not reliable in any great degi-ee as

evidence of connexion between distant tribes and races in an early condition of

culture. Even in cases in which time and diversity of dialect, as causes change,

have been eliminated, the experience of everyday life proves how little reliance is

to be placed in the verbal transmission of ideas. In studying Gallic traditions,

Mr. Campbell, of Islay, who has collected a larger number of Gallic stories than
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

any man living, informs me that although the general plot of a story, like the
grammatical construction of a language, may with doubt and difficulty be traced
throuo-h many variations into distant countries, the details in all that relates to

names of the heroes, costumes, and implements, and all the material events con-
nected with the stories are subject to such radical changes as to render them totally
untrustworthy in point of date and sequence. Mr. Tylor also, in his interesting
and valuable work on primitive culture, has stated his inability, by means of myths
and relio-ions, to trace in the majority of cases the connexion between early races
and this circumstance, fairly and rationally as he has placed it before us in all his

writings, has, I venture to think, led many who rely mainly on this class of evi-

dence to incline too strongly towards the hypothesis of independent origin (more

so at least than I should be disposed to do), and to make insufficient allowance for
the rapidly recurring changes produced by the imperfect transmission of ideas,
through the operation of which all trace of tlie channels of communication would
be rapidly obliterated, and those mj'ths which, from being best suited to the mental
condition of the people, had survived in distant countries would present the ap-

pearance of spontaneous and independent origin. In all this class of anthropolo-
gical evidence Mr. Tylor has shown that the invention of writing and other con-
comitants of impi'oved culture have been the means of introducing an element of

stability and permanence, so that we are presented with the phenomena of progress
in the direction of unity and .simplicity as opposed to diversity and complexity.
On the other hand, the language of the arts may be said to have been a written
language from the time of the first appearance of man upon the earth ; less liable

to variation in transmission, the links of connexion between lower and higher

forms have been preserved and handed down to us from the remotest period of
time, and by testifying to the comparatively steady and continuous development
which has taken place, encourage us to hope that by diligently prosecuting our
studies into this department of anthropology, every relic of prehistoiic ages may
eventually be made to mark its own place in sequence, if not in time.

   The greater stability of the material arts as compared with the Huctuations in
the language of a people in a state of prinneval savagery is well shown by a con-
sideration of the weapons of the Australians and the names by which they are
known in the several parts of that continent. As I have already mentioned, these
people, from the simplicity of their arts, afford us the only living examples of what
we may presume to have been the characteristics of a primitive people. Their
weapons, respecting the distribution of which we have more accurate information
than we have of their vocabularies, are the same throughout the continent ; the
shield, the throwing-stick, the spear, the boomerang, and their other weapons

difi'er only in being thicker, broader, flatter, or longer in different localities; but
whether seen on the east or the west coast each of these classes of weapons is

easily recognized by its form and uses. On the other hand, amongst the innu-

merable languages and dialects spoken by these people, it would appear that almost
every tribe has a different name for the same weapon. The narrow panyiug-shield,
which consists of a piece of wood with a place for the hand in the centre, in South
Australia goes by the name of Heileman, in other parts it is known under the name

of Mulabakka, in Victoria it is Turnmung, and on the west coast we have Muru-
kanye and Tamarang for the same implement very slightly modified in size and

form. Referring to the comparative table of Australian languages compiled by the

Rev. George Taplin, in the first Number of the ' Journal of the Anthropological
Institute,' we find the throwing-stick, which on the Murray River is known by the

name of Yova, on the Lower Darling is Yarrum, in New South Wales it is Wom-

murrur, in Victoria Kamck, on Lake Alexandrina Taralye, among.st the Adelaide

tribes, South Australia, it is Midla, in other parts of South Australia it is called

Ngeweangko, and in King George's Sound Miro. None of the weapons show less
variety of form than the boomerang; on the Murray River this is known by the
name of Wanya, on the Lower Darling Yarrumba, on the North Darling Mulla-
Murraie, on Lake Pando Wadna, on the Liverpool Plains Burran, in Victoria
Kertom, on Lake Alexandrina Panketye, and in King George's Sound Kyli.
Between the majority of these names it will be seen that it is impossible to trace
the faintest resemblance of sound. Yet no one, it is presumed, would bt; so

irrational as to suppose that so peculiar a weapon as the boomerang, for example,

could have been invented independently in as many diffdrent localities as there are

different names for it ; nor is it reasonable to suppose that such extremely simple

weapons as those in use by the Australians should have spread from a common
centre, subsequently to the establishment of the various languages as they are now
spoken. The weapons of the Australian, as I have shown in my paper on Primitive

Warfare, published in the ' Journal of the Royal United Service Institution,' are

all traceable, like the languages, to primitive forms, which are the natural forms of

stumps and stems of trees ; like the languages they have also varied and diverged
but whilst the names for them have changed so completely as to present no signs

whatever of connexion in the different tribes, the weapons themselves have varied

so slightly as to be recognized at a glance in all parts of the Continent. Even in

modern times, since the introduction of vvTiting has given permanence to the lan-

guages and ideas of the people amongst whom it has been introduced, we find

instances of the comparative stability of the material emblems and forms of things

in the retention of pagan emblems in our own religions and those of other coun-

tries, and notably the employment of tire and water in our religious ceremonies,

which have survived with so much vitality as to be living sources of controversy
amongst parties, one and all of whom would utterly repudiate the ideas with which

these emblems were associated at their birth.

If, then, it is evident that much of the history of our prehistoric ancestors has

been for ever lost to us, we may console ourselves with the refiection that in their

tools and weapons and other relics of their material arts the most .reliable somce
of evidence as to their intellectual condition has continued to our time. As to the

myths, religions, superstitions, and languages with which they were associated, we

may content ourselves by devoutly thanking Providence that they have not been

preserved. As it is, anthropological studies are said to have their fiiir share in the

creation of lunatics ; and we can easily believe that no sane intellect would have
survived the attempt to unravel such a complex and tangled web of difficulty as

the study of these subjects would have presented to our minds.

Two other examples, with your permission, I will give for the pui-pose of illus-

trating the principle of variation and continuity as applied to the customs and arts

of savage races, and the relative superiority of material evidence in tracing the

changes effected by these means. The customs associated with the practice of

human sacrifice amongst the Konds of India have received prominent notice of

late years, owing to the steps which have been taken by the Government to put

them down. From the reports presented to the Government of India by various

officers, we learn that these customs vary considerably in minor points in
different localities. Amongst those who have written on the ethnology of India,

there is no one from whose accurate and scientific observation of the

habits of the aborigines we have derived more valuable information than Sir
Walter Elliot. From him we learn that similar customs prevail in every

village in Southern India. The village customs, however, differ from the
Kond rites in this important particular, which we can easily understand is the

reason why the resemblance between them has never been noticed by former
writers namely, that the practice of human sacrifice has been abandoned, and a

butFalo is substituted for a human victim ; in the mode of sacrificing and disposing
of the flesh and other matters connected with the rites, we see that these village
customs are in reality the modern representations of the more ancient Kond sacri-

fices, and that whilst an immense step has been made in the civilization of the
people by the abandonment of the barbarous practice of human sacrifice, the

parallel to which is probably seen in the account of Abraham's sacrifice in the Old

Testament, the continuity has been kept up by the preservation of some of the minor

customs which are associated with the more ancient rites. Now Sir Walter

Elliot tells us that these modified village sacrifices, like the older human sacrifices,

vary in the details in every village of S mthern India. I need hardly say how much

the value and accuracy of tliese studies would be promoted if we could obtain detailed

accounts of the varieties of these customs as they are now practised in the several

villages,  with  the  causes  of variation  in  each  case                       we  should  by this means  obtain
                                                                              ;

mactually on the move at the present time. Hereafter, all probability, as they

continue to vary by the omission of some portions of the ceremonies and the substitu-

tion of others, some one village, more advanced and more powerful than its neigh-

bours, in the natural course of things will obtain the ascendency, and will impose

its peculiar and greatly modified version of these rites upon the neighbouring vil-

lages, by which means the links of connexion will be completely lost. I believe

the time is at hand when we shall make as much ado over a variety of custom or

form of implement as naturalists now do over a new moth or a beetle, and then
anthropology wiU become a science.

  My next illustration is taken from the ornamental paddles of the New-Irelanders,

one of the Papuan group of islands adjoining the one in which Bishop Patteson

was lately murdered. In none of the productions of savage art is the tendency to

continued variation within narrow limits more strongly shown than in these orna-

mental patterns. Whilst the form of a club or a paddle appears to remain un-

changed for many generations, the form of ornament upon it will be subject to

variations, which, however, are not the less found to be continuous and connected

when a sufficient number of specimens are collected, so as to enable their history

to be traced. The continuous looped coil and its varieties, and its ultimate deve-
lopment into the continuous fret pattern, may be traced in its migrations through

distant regions. Sometimes a particular variety of these patterns will establish

itself in a tribe or a nation ; and whilst subject to an infinity of subvarieties, it will
be found to be repeated over and over again in aU the weapons and implements

belonging to this tribe. The ornamentation employed by the tribes on the N.W.

coast of America consists entirely of the representation of a bird's head, the eyes

and beak of which have been subject to such variations in copying as completely

to have lost all trace of the original design. The New-Ivelanders ornament their
paddles with the figure of a man painted in red and black, carved upon the face of

the blade. Fig. 2 is a good example of this conventionalized mode of representing
the human figure in full ; fig. 11 is another ornament upon the paddle of the same

people                             and  between  these  two figures  it would not at first sight appear  possible
                                ;

that any connexion could be traced.

Ingenious theories might, perhaps, be based upon the occurrence of such a

figure as that represented in fig. 11 amongst the Papuan Islands; it might be

assumed that Mahomedanism had once penetrated that region, and they had

adopted the symbol of tlie crescent, or the advocates of spontaneity would find no

difficulty in at once assuming that they had copied the new moon. No one who

had not by previous experience been impressed with the continuity pervading all

savage ornamentation would dream of connecting two such widely different forms

as those represented in these two figures. Those, however, who are familiar with

the pictographic changes which marked the origin of the Phoenician and Scandi-
navian alphabets, or who have studied Mr. Evans's work on Ancient British Coins,

or the researches of Mr. Edward Thomas into the Coins of India, will be prepared for

the marvellous transformations to which human and other forms are subjected
when they are copied and recopied by the inaccurate and uninstructed eyes of
savage imitators. They will remember how the chariot and horses on the

Greek coins of Philip of Macedon, in the hands of the Gaulish and British artists,

--gradually lost, first the body of the chariot, then the body of the charioteer how the

wheels of the chariot became mixed up with the body of the horse, and the head

--of the driver appeared floating like a cherubim over the horse's ears and how, on the

obverse of the coin, the nose and features of the head gradually disappeared, until

nothing but the wreath converted into a cruciform ornament remained to connect

it with the original figure of the Greek king. Impressed with the idea of the physical

identity of people in the same condition of culture, I determined to collect New-

Ireland paddles, and see whether a connexion would be found to exist between the

peculiar patterns with which they are ornamented. The result is the series now

before you, which I have obtained at ditierent times during the last seven years as
they turned up in curiosity-shops or were brought over by travellers from the

South Seas ; and it must be understood that these particular specimens are not

myselected to serve                              purpose.  I have here given the whole of the collection of

patterns which have fallen into my hands. Let us see how far they serve to sup-

port our views as to variatioa and continuity now that they are put together.

Fiw. Ij it will at once he seen, represents, hoth on the handle and on the face of
the blade, the head of a Papuan ; the large hlack mass on the head, like a grenadier-

cap, is the Papuan head-dress peculiar to these parts ; the ears are elongated
accordino- to the custom of these people, and pierced with an ear-ornament ; the

eyes are round black dots, the nose a triangular red mark, aud the same colour is
spread over the forehead. Fig. 2 represents the full figure of a Papuan sitting;
the ears are drawn down towards the liands, tbe head is somewhat conven-
tionalized, the line of the nose is carried round the eyes in a scroll, and there is a

lozenge-shaped pattern on the forehead. Fig. 3 is nearly the same figure repre-

sented as sitting sideways, simply by lopping off" an arm aud a leg on one side. In
fio-. 4 we have two arms, but no legs, and the head continues much the same as in
the two preceding figures. In fig. 5 the whole body is gone, and the scroll-pattern
round the eyes is modified in form. In fig. 6 we see a great change in the form
of the head, which is much more conventionalized than in the preceding figures

the eyes are reduced to small dots, and are rendered subordinate to the scroll

formed by prolongation of the line of the nose ; the sides of the face ai*e concave,

and conform to the line  of the nose                                                      the chin  and  mouth                                            are  enlarged                                                        the head
                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                        ;

is surmounted  by the Papuan  head-dress, as before                                                                                                there  is a lozenge-pattern,                                                as
                                                                                                                                                ;

before, on the forehead ; the elongated ears are there, but the ear-omament has

disappeared ; in this face the nose has become the prominent feature, and the

other features are subordinate to it. In fig. 7 a stiU greater change has taken

place ; the greater part of the face and head are gone. In the last figure we saw
that the nose was becoming the prominent feature, here it is nearly the only fea-

ture left ; the elongated ears are drawn down the sides of the nose ; the lozenge-

pattern on the forehead still remains ; but the lines, which in the previous figures

led to the head-dress and to the scroll-pattern, have been turned into a kind of

leaf-shaped ornament, resembling what appears to have been the upper lobe of the

ear in the previous figures ; the eyes are brought do^vn on to the nose. In fig. 8

we have nearly the  same figure as the last :                                             the       nose is divided in two                                                                                                     the elon-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

gated ears are drawn out square with the line of the nose ; the lozenge-pattern on
the forehead is still preserved. In fig. 9 we see the same figure as in the last

example, except that the triangular nose has merged into what, judging by the

previous figures, appears to be the chin, or it may be merely an enlargement of

the base of the nose.    Fig. 10 represents a further change in this direction
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the lozenge-pattern and the ears are now gone, and the leaf-pattern is much

reduced; the nose also has almost disappeared into the chin. Lastly, in fig. 11,

we come to our Maliomedan emblem, or copy of the new moon. What is it ?

Who would have believed it was the chin of the human figure ? Yet so it is. It

is the last vestige of a human face, copied and recopied until all trace of the

Weoriginal had been completely lost.                                                      have here a complete parallel to the trans-

formations observable on the British coins, showing with what close analogy the

minds of men in the same condition of culture, though of widely different races,

obey the same laws and are subject to the same causes of variation and continuity

in the development of their arts. Now, if we suppose the connecting-links which

are exhibited in these figures to represent the connecting-links of myths, customs,

religions, or languages, or any other productions of human ingenuity which are

not embodied in material forms or committed to writting, it is evident they would

have been lost ; they would not have turned up in cuiiosity-shops, or been brought

together side by side in an instructive series. The theory of the spontaneous

adoption of crescent-shaped patterns, by copying the moon, would have become

established as an almost self-evident fact in our minds, and no one could for a mo-

ment have seen reason to doubt it.

   In omitting all mention of Psychology and Comparative Anatomj', it must not

be supposed that I am immiudful of the services which these studies may be ex-

pected to render to our science hereafter. Nor is it mnmportant to remember that

Anthropology has its practical and humanitarian aspect, and that, as our race is

more otten brought in contiict with savages than any other, a knowledge of their

habits and modes of thought may be of the utmost value to us in utilizing their

labour, as well as in checking those inhuman practices from which they have but
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                 171

too often suffered at our hands. These are branches of the subject into which I

have no time to enter on the present occasion. I believe, however, that for some

time to come prehistoric archceology, and the comparative study of the arts of

races in different conditions of culture, must continue to hold a prominent place

amongst the researches of anthropologists, not on accoimt of the greater importance

or interest attaching to the investigation of these subjects, but on account of the

superior quality of the evidence which these studies afford.

   The consideration of the value of evidence naturally leads us to the third part of

--my subject namely, the mode of collecting it and of digesting it after it has been

brought together ; and as this is, I believe, the most defective part of oui' organiza-

tion, or, to speak more properly, the part of our existing institutions in which our

want of organization is most conspicuous, I had intended to have spoken at greater

length on this subject ; but as I have already trespassed upon your time so long, I

am under the necessity of curtailing what I had to say on the subject of organization.

If I am wrong, as I have heard it suggested by some anthropologists, in supposing

that the greatest difficulties under which we labour are attributable to the absence

of reliable evidence, and if we already possess as much information about savages

and about prehistoric men as we require, and we have nothing to do but to read

the books in our libraries, and write papers calculated to promote discussion and

--fill journals with interesting controversies and speculations if, as I gravely heard

it asserted not long ago at a public meeting, it would be a pity to explore Stone-

henge for fear so remarkable a monument should be divested of that mystery which

has always attached to it, owing to our entire ignorance as to its origin and uses,

then to those who entertain such views the few remarks I shall venture to offer on

this subject must appear not only superfluous but mischievous. But if, on the

other hand, I am right in supposing that oiu- existing evidence is lamentably

--deficient, and in many cases false that it has been collected by travellers many of
--whom have had but little knowledge what to look for and observe and if, this

being the state of our knowledge, the evidence which we desire to obtain is now

rapidly disappearing from the face of the earth (the Tasmanians have been

swept away before we know any thing about them; the New-Zealauders and all the
Polynesiaii-l slanders are fast changing their habits ; and it is now difficult to find a

North-American Indian in a state of unadulterated savagery ; whilst at home our

prehistoric monuments are broken up and ploughed down day by day in the con-

struction of buildings and railroads), it is evident that a set of societies which

provide no organization whatever for promoting exploration at home or abroad

can only be regarded as fulfilling very imperfectly the functions which institutions

established for the purpose of anthropological investigation might reasonably be

expected to serve. Beyond the limits of this Association there is but one Society

in this country which has the funds necessary for promoting explorations,

and that is the txeographical Society. Every expedition which goes out under the

auspices of that Society is necessarily brought in contact with the races in-

habiting the districts which are explored; but it can hardly be expected
that the Geographical Society should do as much as could be desired in the

way of promoting anthropological investigation, as long as Anthropology and
AEthnology are excluded from the functions of that Society.
                                                              Geographical

Society should be regarded as the eyes and ears of an Anthropological Society

abroad, in the same way that the Archaeological Societies should fulfil the

functions of eyes and ears directed to the past history of man, and the most inti-
Amate alliance ought to exist between them.
                                             step in the right direction has lately

been taken, at the suggestion of Mr. Clements Markham, by the establishment of a

joint committee of the Geographical Society and Anthropological Institute, to draw

up questions for travellers whom it is proposed to send to the Arctic seas ; and this,

it is to be hoped, Avill be the first step towards a more intimate alliance in the future.
As to the Archaeological Societies, whose name is legion, and the functions of which

are necessarily anthropological in a great degree, they are as a rule the most im-

potent and unprogressive bodies, living from hand to mouth, with funds barely

sufficient to maintain a secretary and to produce a small volume of Transactions

annually ; without the means of promoting exploration, they are dependent entirely
upon the casual communications of members, the substance of which is sometimes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

repeated over and over again in the different societies. These Archaeological Societies

and others (which I do not particularize, because I am anxious that my remarks

should not appear to be directed pointedly to any one of them) collectively provide

libraries in the proportion of four or five libraries to one or two students who habi-
tually read the dooks in them. When museums form part of the establishments,

they succeed in collecting a stray Chinese umbrella or two, and a stuffed monkey,
or a few bronzed implements in a case. Each Society has separate apartments pro-
vided at great cost ; these are empty at least six days a week, and usually thirteen
days in the fortnight, dm'ing the short period in which the session is held. One of
these societies is in the possession of a magnificent suite of apartments, which are
provided at the Government expense, and furnished with rows of tables and benches
and a splendid throne for the chairman, in which I have occasionally had the honour
to sit. It is to be hoped that whenever the power of psychic force, or the influence
of disembodied spirits in vivifying inanimate bodies, comes to be more generally
established amongst anthropologists than it is at present, these chairs and tables

may proceed to deliberate and rap out archiBological communications to each other
during the weary days and hours that the embodied spirits are absent. Whenever

any undertaking of national interest has been set on foot, such as the Bill for the
Preservation of Prehistoric Monuments, proposed by Sir John Lubbock, inviting
the united interest of these societies to bring it forward, the first inquiry has been
as to which of these societies has had the credit of having originated the measure
and if found to be tainted by the support of a rival society, it has been at once re-
pudiated, or only adopted after its success has with great difficulty been secured by

other means. If we inquire what useful purpose is served by these divisions of the
metropolitan societies, we are told that one is a society, another is an association,

and a third is an institute ; and yet it does not appear that any one of these societies,
associations, or institutes perform any special function which cannot equally well
be served by the others. They constitute divisions of persons rather than divisions
of subjects; instead of promoting division of labom-, they serve only to promote re-

Setition of labour ; and so ill do any of them answer the expectations of those who

  evote themselves to the close study of any one branch of archaeology or anthro-
pology, that it has lately become necessai-y to establish an additional metropolitan
society for promoting protohistoric archaeology, under the title of the Society of
Biblical Archaeology, embracing subjects which fall mainly within the domain of

anthropology. Much as I should feel disposed to condemn the multiplication of

societies under existing circumstances, I cannot but think that by promoting the
close study of a particular branch, the establishment of this Society is a step in the

right direction ; and I therefore trust that it may be found to flourish at the expense
of those which appear to have no special function to perfomi. As a prehistoric
archaeologist, I can only add my humble testimony to that of others who think that

this branch of anthropology is very unsatisfactorily dealt with by the metropolitan

societies in which it is discussed. On a recent occasion, when speaking on this
subject, I compared the position which prehistoric archaeology now holds in the

London societies to that of a poor relation. I might, perhaps, extend the simile
further by saying that, like many poor relations, it is also the most agreeable rela-
tion, and though duly snubbed in accordance with the orthodox custom in like

cases, its services will not be willingly dispensed with, as it furnishes sensational

topics for not less than six societies in London at the present time. The discussions,
however, are for the most part conflned to the most rudimentary branches of the
subject, and but little importance attached to details, because the principles are not
understood. Quite recently this happy family has been increased by the birth of a
fine child, under the title of an Historic Society ; and I observe that, by way of
specializing the functions of this Society, it commenced life with a paper on Pre-
historic Man. But there are no signs of any limitation to this improvident child-

bearing ; it is announced that a Psychological Society is confidently expected. No

one would be more disposed than myself to welcome psychology as a special branch
of study if this family of gutter-children is to go on increasing ad Itbitmn ; but it
will be admitted that a Psychological Society of all others is liable to grow up
scatterbrained if completely severed from the influence of its more experienced

kinsfolk.

   But I have said notliing as yet about the country cousins. If the heads of the
families are such as I have endeavoured to describe them, what must the country
cousins be ? I have spoken of the g'uttcr-eliildreu of the metropolis; but we must

follow the gutters into the sewers before we can form a just estimate of the con-
dition of the local societies ; and yet I believe that with a very small amount of

organization the local societies are capable of performing the most important func-

tions in regard to at least one branch of our science. It is hardly necessary for me
to observe that my remarks apply exclusively to the question of orc/anization, and
cannot for a moment be supposed to have any bearing on the abilities of the indi-
vidual members, amongst whom are included many very able men ; but Ave all
know that the best army in the world may be rendered impotent through defective

organization. The conditions under which local societies are established are in-

compatible with a very high standard of elficiency in any special department of

science ; owing to the very various qualitications of a small body of members, their

J»roceedings must necessarily be miscellaneous ; but they are usually supported by

 ocal interests, which may be of the utmost value, and are often indispensable in

promoting the exploration of local prehistoric antiquities, and they only require
the prestige derivable from a national organization to render them efficient in this

respect. As it is, local societies have often reason to complain of the metropolitan
societies, which draw some of the best correspondence from the counties and give

but little in return.

   I trust that I have made it apparent that anthropology in its various branches
includes some of the most popular and widely disseminated scientific interest of the
country, and that the loss of power is enormous ; }iot only is there no means of
organized exploration, but the information which is published is either repeated
over and over again in the different societies, or it is so scattered as to be beyond
the reach of the majority of the students. They labour also under the disadvan-
tage of being supported chiefly by men of small means ; for the well-to-do classes
in this countrj' do not, as a rule, take any interest in either scientific or anthropo-
logical investigations. During the past year a single American has done more in
the way of anthropological exploration than the whole of the English societies,

institutes, and associations together.

myI will now briefly state                                    views as to the remedies for the evils of which I

have spoken. I am averse to the principle of amalgamation : the most active

members are not always the most enlightened ; narrow views are often the most

pronounced, and if they become dominant are liable to bring down the standard of

an amalgamated society instead of enlarging its sphere of usefulness ; besides, this
amalgamation necessarily entails a certain loss of income by the loss of double

subscriptions.

  If my experience as a member of the council of most of the societies of which I
speak does not deceive me, it should be the object of those who have the progress

of anthropological studies at heart to induce the metropolitan societies to specialize

their functions. The following might then become the titles of the various so-
cieties included under the term anthropology ; and they would represent not only
the natural divisions of the science, but practically the divisions which are most

consonant with the organization of the existing societies. Setting history and his-

--toric archajology aside as bej'ond our province, we should have : (1) Proto-historic

archaiology ; I adopt the term proposed by Mr. Hyde Clarke for this branch, which

practically includes all that conies under the head of Biblical Archoeology at

present                                     (2)  Prehistoric  Arclueology                                                            (3)  Philology (4) Biology, including
                                         ;                                                                                        ;                                                       ;

Psychology and Comparative Anatomy, in so far as it relates to Man; (.5)

Descriptive Ethnologj', viz. original reports of travellers on the races of man,

conducted in association with geographical exploration. Under these heads

we should, I believe, include all the various classes of special workers. These

--should constitute independent, but associated societies that is to say, the

members of one should be privileged to attend the meetings and take part in

the discussions of the others, but not to receive the publications of any but

their own society. By this means each would profit by the experience of the other

societies, but the funds necessary for the maintenance of each would be secured.

As branch sections of authropologv they would be under the control of a general
                                                                                                                           '

elected council only in so far as would be uecessary to prevent tlieir clasliiug witli
each otlier, and for the control of auy nieasui'es which it might be necessary for

the several sections to undertake in concert; under the auspices of the general

council might also be held the anthropological meetings devoted to such general

subjects as either embraced the whole or were not included in the sections. By

this means the standard of anthropological science as a comprehensive study of the

science of man in all its branches would be secured, and the possibility of its

becoming narrowed under the influence of any dominant party would be obviated.

It is hardly necessary to say that the chief ad^'antage of such an arraugemeut as I

suggest would consist in the employment of a single theatre and library for these

cognate societies ; the)' would employ a single printer, and the arrangements might
include one or more artists, lithographers, and map-drawers, by which a great

increase, and at the same time economy, would be etl'ected in the illustrations.

The saving effected by the union of these societies in a single establishment might

be applied to conducting explorations, either at home or abroad, in connexion with

the Geographical Society. The question of the utilization of apartments is one

which commends itself especially to the notice of Government in regard to tliose
societies for which apartments are provided at the public cost. It should be made

a sine qua. non that the societies so favoured should fairly represent all the branches

of their subject.

As regards the local societies, it has been proposed to republish a selection of

their papers under the auspices of this Association. It is to be hoped that some

arrangement, such as that proposed by the committee of which Hir Walter Elliot

is secretary, may be carried out. I have only one suggestion to make on this

point: republication is simply a repetition of cost and labour, if the desired object

of bringing the papers together can be accomplished by other means. As to selec-

tioji, I have no faith in it. If local and metropolitan societies could be induced to

adopt a uniform size for their publications, not necessarilj' a uniform type, the

papers relating to the same subjects might be brought together without the cost of

reprinting. It would only be uecessary to establish a classiiication of papers under

various headings, such as, for example, those which constitute the sections of this

Association. The societies might then print additional copies of their papers under

each heading, in the same manner that additional copies are now struck off for the

Ause of autliors.  single metropolitan society might be recognized as the repre-

sentative of each branch, and under its auspices the Avhole of the papers of the local

and metropolitan societies relating to its branch might be brouglit together and

printed in a single volume. Time does not allow ine to enter into the details of

the arrnngements which would be uecessary to carry out sucli a measure. I believe

the difficulties would not be so great as might at first sight appear, especially as

the evils of the existing arrangements are mucli complained of ; but it should be a

primary object of any arrangement that may hereafter be made that the independ-

ence of the several branches should not be sacrificed unnecessarily ; it should be

endeavoured to stimulate them and train them into useful channels rather thau to
bring them too much imder central control.

  My object in making these remarks has been not so much to bring forward any
special recommendation of my own as to ventilate the matter amongst those of the

public who take an interest in these studies, but who are not so intimately con-

nected with the present working of the societies as to have any personal interest in

them; and I trust that the importance of the subject will be thought to justify me

in having brought it to the notice of the meeting.

It is to be hoped that whenever, as anthropologists, we parade for Dr. Living-

stone's inspection (without, I trust, adhering too closely to the costume which he

has suggested for that occasion), it may be found that if we cannot compete with

his friends the anthropophagi in point of bone and muscle, in all that relates to

organized division of labour and mutual cooperation we may not be foxmd v.-anting

in that superiority to our betters which might naturally be expected from the

.advanced ci\ilization which we enjoy.

On tfie Predominating Danish Aspect of tlic Local Nomenclatilre of Cleveland,

                      Yorlsliire. By the Rev. J. C. Atkinson.

  A careful study of the place-names iu Cleveland has led the author to the general

conclusion that upwards of 80 per cent, of the genuine old forms in this district
are certainly of l)anish origin. It appears that only a few of the ancient local
names can be referred to Anglian sources; in fact the Anglian element in Cleve-

land history may have been altogether subsidiary.
   From an analysis of the names of places, as preserved in the Domesday Book and

in -writings of more mediajval date, the author finds 50 names ending in -hi, 13 in
-thcD-p, 12 in -ilm-aite, 31 iu -dale, 14 in -wh), 7 in -ffrif, 8 in -cliff or -dive, 3 in
-hor(/ or -hurg, besides about .55 not specially classed ; and from the early date of
the occurrence of these names haixlly 1 iu 50 admits of any doubt as to its essen-
tially northern origin. In addition to these, there is a very large number of names,
belonging to the classes in -dale and -clif and to the gTOups in -rir/f/, -sike, -hohn,
-held, -sty, -wyke, -icath, &c., which are not included iu the author's lists because
there is no documentary proof of their imposition preA'iously to medireval times.
It is almost certain, too, that not a few of the names iu -ton &c. have a northern
origin. On the whole, out of something under 250 Cleveland names, dating back
to media3val times and yet earlier, upwards of 210, or considerably more than 80
per cent., must imhesitatingly be ascribed to a Danish as contradistinguished from

an English or Anglian source.

   Eivploration of some Tumidi on Dartmoor. By C. Spence Bate, F.R.S.

   The tumuli on Dartmoor are generally cairns of stone. Three of these were explored
on Penbeacon, and a very large one on Threebarrow Tor. The whole of these ap-
peared to have been previously rummaged. In one of those on Penbeacon the remains
of an nrn of coarse pottery were found scattered about, and the kistvean had the
capstone fallen in amongst the soil within was found an implement of along oval

                                                                                                    ;

form, made out of white slate. The author believed this, from its worn appearance
at the ends and sides, to have been made use of by the potter in forming the rudely
shaped urn, such pieces of slate being still in use for that purpose in some parts of

Ireland.

   On Ilamel Down are several tumuli that differ from those of Dartmoor generally.
Among these were three built of earth only, margined round by small moorland

stones. This neighbourhood being associated with such Scandinavian names as
Grimm, Ilamel, Szc, the author thought that an exploration of these barrows
might throw some light as to whether or not these old Vikiuger visited Dartmoor
for that tin which was essential for the manufacture of their bronze.

    In the barrow, after removing a large quantity of earth, about halfway between
the circumference and the centre, five large stones were found lying side by side on
the surface of the ground beneath one of these stones were found some burnt bones

                                                                                                                                           ;

and a bronze dagger-blade chased with lines along the sides and with dots at the base :
an oval ornament of amber inlaid with gold fits in lines corresponding with the

longer and shorter axes.
    This feature in the interment, together with the circumstance that the burnt

bones were not enclosed within an urn, ofi'er strong evidence, the author contends,

of the intrusion of the old Norsemen into these regions in a very early stage of the

Bronze period.

Note on a Visit to the Hypoycimi. By J. F. Cajh-sell, of May.

The author read extracts from his diary, descriptive of a visit to the hypogeiim

on October 4, 1871. His description was illustrated by several sketches, and

Aagreed substantially with that of Mr. Caimichael.  box of bones was taken

from the spot by the author and submitted to I'rofessor Owen.

176 REPORT--1872.

J^otes on tlie LoosJia'is. By Aechibald Campbell, M.B.

   For a long time the Loo.shais were best known to U3 under the name of Kookiei?,
and it is even now not quite clear how far the two terms are properly convertible,

or should be used to designate separate tribes or the divisions of one tribe.

The Looshais inliabit the hill-tracts of Chittagong and those adjoining that

British province, whence they extend north and north-east till they reach Oachar

on the one hand and the frontiers of Biu-mah on the other. They form one of the

numerous tribes generically known as the Toum/tha, or Children of the Hills.

Their complexion is fairer than that of the people of the plains ; their features

resemble those of the Malays more than the Tartar-faced people of Munipore

and their language is said to be remarkable for euphonic sweetness compared with

the harsh and guttural dialects of the Tartar races to the nortli.

The Looshais diy and         preserve  their dead ;  they have no distmctions  of  caste
                                                                                                           ;

marriage is a civil contract dissoluble at the will of the parties concerned, and there

is no prohibition against the marriage of widows. The men live by hunting and

marauding, while cultivation and all household work is left to the women. They

live in log-houses on the ridges of the hills, and know enough of iron- working to

make spear-heads and fish-hooks.

   Hitherto the Looshais have been known only as a savage and murderous race
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but the author quoted from the recent ofhcial reports of Brigadier-General Brown-

low, C.B., Brigadier-General Bourchier, C.B., and Mr. Burland, who accom-

panied the expedition against the Looshais, to prove the excellent character of

their social organization, the mildness of their disposition, their general intelligence

and industry, and their aptitude for trade. The author expressed a hope that the

Looshais would, in the progress of tea-planting in Oachar, be induced to adopt its

cultivation in their ow\\ hills, and would also join the coolie bands working in the

British districts.

On a Hypotjeum at Vala^uie, North Uisi. By A. A. CARiircnAEL.

In this paper the author described an underground dwelling at Druim-nah-Uamh,

in Valaquie, on the north-west coast of North Uist, one of the Hebrides. Althougli

the structure was discovered ten years ago, but little was done to ascertain its

real nature until last year (1871), when the author caused the sand, which nearly

filled the building, to be removed, and thus exposed the true form of the hypo-

geum. On the floor of native sand a large quantity of bones, teeth, and shells was

found : the bones were chiefly those of the deer, ox, pig, and sheep ; the shells

were those of the limpet, mussel, cockle, and periwinkle, with a few broken scallop-

shells. Mingled witli these remains were charcoal ashes, broken pottery, the tine

and antlers of the red deer, and the upper half of a small quern.

The ground-plan of the hypogcum is crescentic. The walls run parallel to each

other, and two stone lintels cross the liouse from side to side. The west end is at

Aright angles to the sides, while the east end is curved.  dome roof is raised by

overlapping stones, terminating in a cap, and giving the roof the appearance of a

flattish beeliive. The entrance is near the middle of the inner wall. There are

four recesses in the walls.

The form and position of the hj'pogeum are peculiar ; but the author points out

its general resemblance to a structure on 31r. James Macphersou's property, described

by the late Sir David Brewster.

               On Sussex River-Names. By Dr. Chaenock, F.S.A.

   The paper gives the etymolog}' of the principal Sussex river-names. After a
dissertation on the rules relating to etymology, tiie author shows that most of the
names coincide with other European river-names, that many are ctymologically
the same word, and that most of tlieni have been named by the Kelts, eitlier
from a pure Keltic root or from a word corrupted by them from tlie Greek or

Ijatin. Among other names traceable to the same root are Adur, Bother, Ouse,

Asten, East[bourne], and Bitch.

              On certain Georiraphical Names in the Ccimtij of Sussex.

                                By Dr. Charnock, F.S.A.

   Among other names, tlie paper attempted the etymology of the follo\^ing :
Fairlight may translate in Saxou beautiful meadow {ffcficr-hay), but is more pro-

bably the same as the English local names Farley, Farlie, Farleigh, from the
'D&msh.-^&xon faar-h'iKj, sheep's meadow. The author discards the usual etymo-
logy of Hastings, and" gives two suggestions, viz. from Danish hest-eng, horse
meadow, and Astcn-eiu/e, meadow of the Asten, a stream which runs through the
battle-field. Framfiel'd is for Frantville, etymologically the same as Frant, -which
gave the ancient appellation of Frant Wells to Tunbridge Wells ; from Danish
vand, water. The ancient name Senlac is from sccn-lcag, beautiful meadow. The
author compares Aderida with Anderitium in Senonia Lugdunensis, Andetrium
in lUyria (the Andretium of the Peutiuger Table), and also with the* Anderitum of
Bavennas, a town of Aquitanian Gaul (now Javols iu the Gevaudun), which the
author derives from Keltic anncdd-ar-rid, a dwelling near a passage or ford. Mutii-

autonis may be from mant-an-ton, mouth of the water, or imcth-ant, rapid river.

                 Roumanian Oipsies. By Dr. CnAKNOCK, F.S.A.

   By the census of 18G0 the Boumanian gipsies are put down at 300,000. Thpy
are well-formed and long-lived. There are, however, many cripples from artificial

causes. They are adroit in work, but work very little, and pass whole days in
sleep. Thej^ are fond of carrion, and are great cowards. Chastity is scarcely
known. Their ordinary diet is a polenta of maize called mdmalir/a. Men, women,
and children smoke from the age of five. The native dance is the tdnand. Most
of them have fixed residences. The Viltrassi class are all well built, have beauti-
ful black eyes and long black hair. Ou becoming motheis the women are very
ugly. The people have entirely forgotten their native language, and have lost the
manners and usages of gipsies. The best musicians are found amongst them.
Some are engaged iu agriculture, and they are more civilized than the Bormianian

peasants.

   The paper concluded with full remarks on the grammar, and a comparative voca-
bulary of the dialect with other gipsy dialects and also with the Indian languages.

        On iJie Gipsy Dialect called "Sim." By Dr. Chaenock, F.S.A.

   The dialect in question is spoken by Egyptian gipsies in the presence of stran-
gers and for secrecy. The author traces most of the words to the Arabic, con-
cealed by prefixes or sufiixes and sometimes by both. The Egyptian suffix ish

(under various forms) is found in a great many words. Other sulKxes are mi, ma
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and dJi, ch are used as prefixes. The paper contained many examples, including
numerals. The word Sim is probably from d-s'nniyd, for el hmiya, secrecy.

        On Tumuli at Asclieraden in Livonia. By Charles T. Croger.

                              (Communicated by Baron N. 0. Bogouschevsliy.)

 --In 1837 a feai'ful iumidation laid open, near Asclieraden, so called, perhaps,

because the Ask-nien (navigators) used to put up their boats (Ask) in this place,
in Livonia, the contents of some tumuli.

 --In most of these the following objects were discovered : Bodies lying with faces

upwards, the arras placed crosswise on the breast and ornamented Avith spiral-shaped
bracelets ; some of these were dressed in a linen shirt made out of verj' delicate
strings fastened together ; over the shirt a woollen overcoat of a greenish-brown
colour, with metallic wire interwoven with the cloth, tlie whole tied round the
Avaist by a leather girdle fastened by means of a metallic brooch. Breeches (in some
cases of cloth and in some of linen) fastened under the knees, and on the finger-
bones brass rings. The head ornamented with a bandage (sometimes perfectly
smooth, sometimes pressed into the shape of a zigzag) ; also a kind of cap made
of spiral rings, which, being fixed on woollen bands, terminate in a point.

   Tlie ornaments on the neck consist chietlj^ of strings of glass and amber beads
and gilded or silvered balls of clay. From the shoulders to the knees hang rows of
chains (sometimes ninefold) covered with amulets in the form of birds, or with
household implements, such as keys, knives, &c. Spears with points ornamented
with silver, sheaths for arrows made of the bark of trees (such as birches)
fastened together by bands of metal, &c. Very few iron swords were discovered,
but a large quantity of coins, of various ages, were found with the bodies of tvarrivrs

only. Among the coins were some Greek coins from Thasos, Roman coins from

the third century B.C. do-wni to Emperor Yalentinian, Anglo-Saxon and Danish
coins from the earliest times down to the twelfth century, German coins from the
time of Otto I. to the eleventh century, coins of Wisby, and Arabic Dyrrhems from
757 to 1011 are very common.

                              Note hy Baron N. C. Bogouschevsky.

   To judge by the general appearance of these bodies, their dress, and the detestation
which the inhabitants of the country entertain even at the present time for these
sepulchres, calling them "the sepulchres of monsters," they do not belong to any

of the Tchndic, Sclavonic, or Wend nations, but to the pilfering Northmen, who

made continual invasions into Greece, Constantinople, &c., very often choosing (as
can be seen from M. Karamzin's ' Hist, of the Russian Empire ') this road, through
the rivers Dwina and Dnieper into the Black Sea, and then following the west

coast as far as Constantinople, but very often proceeding further, into the Mediter-

ifinean, &c. As thej' came baclc by the same road, they left numerous traces of
their passages in the shape of tumuli, rows of which cover tlie whole length of

eoiintry between Livonia in the north and the delta of the Dnieper in the south,
and hidden depo.sits of Asiatic, Roman, and Greek coins, wliicli in some cases of
danger they were obliged to secrete, and afterwards were either prevented from

returning to these deposits by v.arious adversities, or perished on the way home, thus
carrying their secrets with them to the grave.

great importance. The cave is situated to the north of Ingleborough, and consists
of several large chambers, often nearly filled up with earth and stones. The Com-

mittee began work by cutting a trench through a layer of stones broken from the
clilf above ; it proved to be resting on a dark layer composed of burnt stones and

bones, fragments of pottery, and a few Eoman coins. On following this layer
right into the cave, several bronze-gilt ornaments, of Roman workmanship, were

found, and otliers which certaiuljr were not Roman, but which bore a strong

resemblance, in design and execution, to Irish or Celtic works of art preserved in
various museums. The Celtic short-horn, the goat, horse, and pig seem to have

been the principal food of the dwellers in the cave, from the great quantity of their

bones which were discovered.
   The strange mixture of articles of luxury and ornament in so wild a place seems

only accountable by the supposition that the cave was inhabited, as a place of
refuge, by some well-to-do Romano-Celtic family, who carried off with them into
their place of retreat many of their valuables, cattle, and other property. The
date of this occupation seems to lie between the fifth century, as shown by the

barbarous imitations of Roman coins, and the first quarter of the seventh century,

when the kingdom of Strathclyde was conquered by the Iv orthumbrians. But, be-
sides this, evidence was found of a much older occupation. Underneath the Romano-

Celtic layer, at the entrance, pieces of chipped flints, broken bones of ox and bear,

and rude bone implements prove that man inhabited the cave at a lower level,

and therefore before the accumulatiou of the talus on it.

   The grey clay on which these more ancient traces of men rested offered a serious

obstacle to further examination, since it was more than five and twenty feet in

thickness within the cave, and contained no remains of men or of animals.
The Committee did not stop here, however, in their work. They have lately

sunk another shaft, and have been rewarded for the great labour of this last enterr

prise  by  the  discovery of a  still  older  occupation  of the  cave  by hyfenas                                                      their

broken "bones, teeth, and coprolites show that they must have lived there in large

numbers, and the gnawed bones of rhinoceros, cave-bear, mammoth, reindeer,

&c. show on what animals they preyed. It is very probable that these remains be-

longed to animals that inhabited Yorkshire in the preglacial stage of the Pleisto-

cene period, and that the stratum above the cave-earth is of glacial age. The fauna

to which they belong invaded Europe before the refrigeration of climate that cul-

minated in the ice-sheet of Northern Europe, and remained in the area north of the

Alps and Pyrenees after the ice-sheet had disappeared from the lower ground.

           Part II.-- 77(6 Physical Histori/ of the Deposits in the Victoria Cave.
                                Bij R. H. TiDDEMAN, M.A., F.G.S.*

 --The cave was described as consisting of three principal chambers a central

one running N.N.E., about 40 yards long, and two others branching off from it to
the right and left. It is probable that these chambers are really but one cavity
filled '^^'ith material up to inequalities in the roof which now separate the

chambers, for the floor has never yet been reached.

   The deposits were described in order of succession, beginning at the surface.^
   No. i. The debris at the entrance is still forming and is undoubtedly derived
from the cliffs above by the frosts of successive winters. The author was of
opinion that no trustworthy calculations of absolute or relative time could be
based upon the thickness of this deposit, the rate of its formation being

evidently far from regular.
   Several floors of occupation are interbedded with this outside the cave, and

inside they He unconformably on the surface of the lower beds next to be de-
scribed. They have been treated of fully by Mr. Dawkins.

   No. ii. The entrance debris graduates below almost imperceptibly into a yellow-
ish-brown clay full of angular fragments of limestone, with occasional beds of

stalagmite. It is thinner at the entrance, but inside attains a thickness of 10 or
12 feet. Large masses of limestone lie on its surface, which have evidently fallen

from the roof, Tlie frngments are angular, and show no signs of rolling or glacial

scratches.

   No. iii. Eelow this Upper Clay-Tvith-stones, wherever penetrated, we find a thick
hed of fine dark-brown laminated clay. The laminations are very distinct and

tolerably regular ; the clay flakes of!" along the planes of bedding, the alternations
consisting of excessively fine sand and tenacious clay.

   It dips steadily towards the inner part of the cave, having an inclination of
about 1 in 9, rather more than G°. It shows a thickness of 12 feet in a shaft sunk

in the left-hand cliamber. With acid it effervesces freely, losing about 8 per cent,
of its weight. Though very well adapted for preserving organic structures, it has

not 3'ielded a trace of any organism even to the microscope.
   No. iv. The lowest set of beds yet attained comes next in order of descent.

They are in all respects similar to No. ii., the Upper Clay-with-stones, save that

in them, near the entrance, at a depth of about 16 feet from the base of the lami-
nated clay, the group of older mammals, as mentioned by Mr. Dawkins, was

discovered.

   The origin of the cUhris at the entrance is clearly subaerial, and it must all of it
be postglacial, for any glacier passing down the valley would infallibly remove it.

   The similarity of the deposits ii. and iv. is so great that there can bo little
doubt that they were made under similar conditions and are due to similar
causes. The angularity of the fragments and the absence of distinct bedding,
save where stalagmite occm'S, forbid us referring them to the sea ; nor can they
be referred to a river, for any stream of sufficient strength to bring the blocks
would certainly have sorted the materials. It is not likely that they are glacial,

and have been pushed into the cave from the side of an advancing glacier ; for then
they would have exhibited some scratches, which is not the case. It seems more

probable that the stones have fallen from the roof, and the clay has been introduced

by water in small volume coming down through crevices in the limestone and
forming, where conditions were favourable, beds of stalagmite.

In direct contrast to the beds above and below, the laminated claj' shows the

greatest regularity of structure.

If it were marine, it seems unlikely that in so good a preservative medium no

fragments  or fibres of organisms should be found                                                                                                                                                                             nor against a rocky beach woidd

it consist of such fine material; also, we should not expect to find it dipping away

from the sea, but towards it or lying horizontal : neither have we anywhere in the

district, for miles around, any indisputable evidence of the sea having been at so

great a height (1450 feet) during or since the glacial period ; any brook flowing

through the cave at so high an angle would not deposit fine mud but remove it.

   The author suggested that the moraine rubbish of a glacier or ice-sheet at some

time blocked the entrance *, that water charged with mud by the constant grinding of

tlie glacier trickled tlirough into the cave, and that the frequent change from

daily flow to nightly inaction gave rise to that close lamination in the deposit

wliich is its characteristic feature.

   This explanation of the glacial origin of the laminated clay was suggested to
the Settle-Cave Committee, in a report in the spring of 1871, by the author.

   Since then he has found in a sliaft sunlv at Ingleton, a few miles to the N.W.,
under 39 feet of till, laminated clay undistinguishable from that in tlie Victoria

Cave, save in the presence of a few well-scratched small boulders and the

crumpling of the beds. Ho considers it probable that this laminated clay was a

deposit from glacier-water in some quiet hollow beneath the edge of the ice-
sheet or its waning representative.

Hills in the north, and in some other secluded situations; but their descendants

are largely intermixed Avitli the people of the plains, especially among the lower

castes.

   Most of these speak dialects of the Dravidian tongue, and in their hunting-excur-
sions make use of a curved stick, which they throw with great dexterity, the con-

cave edge heing directed to the object. Hares, birds, and even deer are killed

with them.

   From this primitive form many of the modern metallic weapons appear to have

been derived, such as the coorg knife or axe, in general use on the Malabar coast,

the liuhri of the Guikhas, in Nepal, and the common woodman's knife

--throughout India all of which are curved and have the cutting-edge on the

concave side. These knives, or choppers, are also used as instruments of sacrifice,
with which the heads of the victims, even of the bufi'alo, are often severed by a

single blow.

Prof. Huxley, in his fourfold classification of the varieties of the human race,

has found what he terms the Australoid division to be represented by the Austra-

Nowlians proper, the Hill tribes of Central India, and the Ancient Egyptians.  it

is remarkable that among all these the throwing-stick is or has been in use. The

boomerang of the Australians is well known ; a similar weapon is depicted in the

hunting-scenes on the walls of the tombs of the kings at Thebes, and in India

it is found to be still in use by the inhabitants of the wilder districts, the de-

scendants of aboriginal races.

   Such coincidences can hardly be accidental, and they aflford a remarkable sup-
port to a deduction drawn from totally difierent premises.

   The Egyptian " throw-stick," according to Sir Gardener Wilkinson, which he
found represented on the sculptured walls of temples, is still in use among the
Desert Arabs, and is a formidable we;ipon in their hands. The Kaffir club made

out of the long horn of the M/tmoccros siimis may be of similar origin.

 On the Alphabet and its Origin. By Johk Evans, Eso[., F.B.S., F.S.A., Sfc.

   After mentioning the labours of Gesenius, De RougiS, and Lenorniant on the

Continent, Professor Hewitt Key, Professor Rawlinson, and Mr. E. B. Tylor in

England, who had, as well as others, done much to throw light on this field of

research, the author treated the subject under three heads :

   1. As to the origin of writing and the method of its development in different

parts of the globe
                                                                                     ;
   2. As to the original Alphabet from which that in common use amongst us was

derived ; and

   3. As to the history and development of that original Alphabet.
    So mysterious does the power of conveying information to others by writing

appear to savages, that they regard written documents as no less than magical,

and have been known to hide them at the time of committing a misdeed which
they feared might be discovered by their means. Yet many of those in the lower
stages of civilization have some ideas as to pictorial records.

   The cave-dwellers of the south of France at a time when the use of metals
was unknown, and when reindeer formed one of the principal articles of food in

that part of the world, possessed considerable powers of drawing and of sculp-

ture. On some of their bone instruments figures of animals are engraved, which
possibly may to the original owners have conveyed some reminiscences of scenes
they had witnessed when hunting. Among the Esquimaux such records are fre-

quently carved on their weapons, and the taking of seals and the harpooning of
w'hales are often depicted. Capt. Beechey saj's that he could gather from these

representations a better insight into the habits of the people than could be obtained
from any signs or otlier intimations.

   Among the North- American Indians the system of picture-writing has been

more fully developed, and numerous instances are recorded in Schoolcraft's 'Indian

Tribes.'

   In Mexico the art of pictorial representation had at the time of the Conquest
been carried to great perfection. The bulk of the pictures, however, merely re-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              :

 present wars, migratious, famines, and scenes of domestic life. They were, more-
 over, able to record dates by means of an ingeniously devised cycle, and had
 some idea of attaching a phonetic value to their symbols.

    In Peru, though some sort of hieroglyphic writing appears to have been known,
 the chief substitute for writing was the Quipu or knotted cord. This consisted of a
 main cord with strings of difrereut colours and lengths attached. The colour,
 the mode of making the loops, knots, or tufts, their distance from the main cord

 or fi-om each other, had all of them their meaning. Each Quipu had its own
 keeper or interpreter, and by their means all public accounts were kept. Tlie

 Wampum in North Ameiica was of somewhat similar character, and in Polynesia

 also the same sort of Quipu is in use.
    There is a tradition among the Chinese of a similar system of recording events

 by means of a knotted cord having been in use among them previous to the inven-
 tion of writing. The Chinese system of writing, though far superior to that of
 the Mexicans, is still not alphabetical, but syllabic. At the outset the characters
 seem to have been pictorial ; but the representations of the objects have now be-
 come so much conventionalized and changed, partly in consequence of the method
 of writing by means of a brush, that there is much dilhculty in recognizing them.

    With a monosyllabic language, the words of which are of necessity limited in
 number, one sound has often to represent more than one sense, and the Chinese

--characters have therefore been divided into phonetics or radicals those which

give the soimd, and the classificatory or determinatives, or those which give the

 sense.

   The Eg;s'ptian hieroglj-phics present much analogy in character with the Chinese
method of writing. In their earliest form the}^ seem to have been principally pic-
torial, though also at the same time symbolic. The next stage would appear to
have been syllabic, when a certain sign represented a syllable, though often Avith
a second more truly literal sign affixed, denoting the final consonant of the syllable.
To prevent mistakes, the signs representing words were often accompanied by other
signs, which were merely determinative of the meaning. Thus three horizontal
zigzag lines representing water, showed that the previous symbol designated some-

--thing connected with liquids or two legs walking, that the word bore reference

to locomotion. Many liierogh^iliics, however', appear to be purely literal, though,

in the case of consonants, often having some vowel sound implied. These literal
hieroglyphics stand for the initial letters of the objects or ideas they represent
for instance, a goose flying is the equivalent of P, the initial of Pai, to fly; an
owl stands for M, the first letter of Mitlar/, the Egyptian name of the bird.

   The more careful pictorial representations of the objects such as are to be seen
in sculptured hieroglyphics and in formal inscriptions required, however, too much
time for their execution to be adopted as an ordinary means of writing. In conse-
quence the signs became conventionalized, and the salient characteristics of the
object were seized on for the more cursive form of writing known as the hieratic.
From this, again, was deiived the writing known as demotic, in which many of the
symbols have become so much changed and simplified that it is with difficulty

that they can be identified as descendants of originally pictorial forms.

  A modified form of liieroglypliic writing is still in use among us, more espe-

cially in connexion with the science of astronomy ; and the conventional foi'ins

wliich now represent the signs of the Zodiac are very instructive as to the amount

of modification such symbols are liable to imdergo.

   In Aries (t) and Taurus (») the heads of the ram and the bull may still bo

nrecognized. Gemini is represented by tlie twin straight lines, ; Cancer by its

claws, 25; and Leo by its head and tail, ft. In the symbol forYirgo there appears
to have been some confusion between Astrtea and the Virgin Mary, the sign being
symbolized by the letters mb, ny^. The scales of Libra, the sting of Scorpio, and
the arrow of Sagittarius can still be traced in tlie symbols, =2=, m, f. The twisted
tail of Capricornus survives in w, and Aquarius is represented by two wavy lines
of water, '.-.u. The remaining sign of Pisces has been much metamorphosed ; but the
two fishes, bad: to bade, with head and tail alternating, can readily be recon-
structed from the symbol K.

and hieratic systems of writiufj, must be borne in mind when studying tlie develop-
ment of other systems.

With regard to the origin of the alphabet in common use in Europe there can

be no doubt, the testimony of classical historians, as well as that of the letters

themselves, being conclusive as to its Phoenician source. But at what date letters

were first in use in Greece is by no means                                                                             certain                              Grote thought  that they were
                                                                                                                                                         ;

absolutely unknown in the days of Homer and Ilesiod (b.c. 850-770). It seems,

however, probable that they were introduced at a somewhat earlier date. If the
date which has been assigned to the famous " Moabite stone," of about 900 B.C.,
be correct, the correspondence in form between the archaic Greek letters and those
on the stone raises a strong presumption in favour of letters having been imported

into Greece at the time when the fhcenician alphabet was in that stage of develop-
ment in winch it occurs on the stone.

   E-i-en the name of the alphabet preserves the memory of its Phojnician origin,
for Alpha and Beta, the names of the two letters from which the word is derived,

are not really Greek, but merely the Ilellenized forms of the Phosuician Aleph and

Beth. The same is the case with the names of all the other Greelc letters down to

Tan, the last five letters, Y, *, X, "ir, a, being of later introduction.

   The correspondence in form laetween the Homan, the Greek, and the early

Phoenician alphabet, as given on the Moabite stone, can readily be traced. It

must, however, be remembered that the letters of the latter are written from right

to left, or in tlie same manner as Ileln-ew, and not, as is the case with us, from left

to right. In the early Greek inscriptions it appears to liave been a matter of

imlilference in which direction the letters were placed. In some the lines are

alternately in         eith.er direction                                                                       and this form of writing was known as Boustrophe-
                                                                                                            ;

don, or that which turned backwards and forwards like an ox in ploughing.

As to tlie original identity of these three alphabets there can be no doubt

neither can any exist as to the order in which the letters were originally arranged

for in the Hebrew Scriptures, the language of -nhich may practically be regarded

as tlie same as tlie Phoenician, there are several instances in whicli a succession

of passages, each commencing with a different letter of the alphabet, present
Athem in this order.
                                                                                                 well-known example is atibrded by the lltlth Psalm, each

of the twenty-two sections of which coumieucos with a different letter, the name
of which forms the heading to each in the English version of the Bible.

  When, however, we come to consider the history and development of the Phcc-
nician alphabet, we are no longer upon so sure a footing. The manner in which

some other forms of writing such as the Chinese and the Egj-ptian hieratic, were

dcA-eloped will have prepared us for the probability of the Phoenician alphabet

having also been evolved from a pictorial source.

It is a by no means unimportant fact, in reference to this view, that the names

of the Plioeniciau or Hebrew letters are not arbitrary, but each significant of somo

object, thoughthe meaning of the names cannot in all cases be recognized with

absolute certainty. For instance, Aleph, Beth, Gimel, and Daleth mean Ox,

House,                 Camel, Door                                                               and  if we find that  these  and the succeeding letters, when
                                                                                              ;

in their most primitive forms (so far as known), present similarities with the
whole or a portion of the objects by the names of which they are distinguished,

there is a strong probability of a pictorial origin for the letters.

Taking the forms of tlie letters, as given on the Moabite stone, in conjunction

with the meaning of their names, such a.similarity can in all cases be traced, though

more certainly intentional in some letters than in others. This will be best shown

in a tabular form* (p. 184).

   This correspondence in form can hardly be appreciated without diagrams, but in

many instances is striking, and in none absolutely forced. Tliere have, however,

been numerous objections raised to such a view of the derivation of the forms of

the Phoiinician letters.

Lenormant and De Rouge would rather trace them to Egyptian hieratic cliarac-

tors                   but the resemblances they point out between them are but slight, and in                                                                             no

sented by the Egyptian hieratic. Moreover the resemblances, -when traced, are
rather with later "forms of Phoenician letters than with those on the Moabite

stone.

   This, however, is contrary to all analogy among- methods of writing of which

we know the development; and moreover, several of the names of the Hebrew
letters are not actual words in common use in the Hebrew writings, but words
which liave become obsolete, and of which, in one or two cases, it is hard to recover
the meaning. The letters, moreover, cannot originally have been mere arbitrary

signs, or there would have been greater distinctions between some of them, such
as it was subsequently found desirable to introduce.

   If, too, the Phceniciau letters came from an extraneous source, we may well ask
where it was, and how it happens that no traces of the original names of the

letters have been preserved.

It seems far more probable that the Phoenicians, possibly in the lirst instance

borrowing the idea from the Egyptians, struck out for themselves a more purely

Aliteral aud therefore a more simple and useful alphabet.                                                                                                                         classification of sounds

once established, and a system of syllabic symbols once invented, the transition to

a pure literal alphabet is comparatively easy, especially when once the syllabic

symbols have, from the introduction of foreign words or from other causes, been

employed for the initial sound only of the syllables they represent.

Such a change, involving a departure from old practice, might perhaps more

readily take place in an adjacent country to that in which the syllabic system pre-

v<ailed than in tlie country itself; and Ave may readily conceive a practical people

like the Phojniciaus importing from Egypt a system of pictorial writing thus

modified.

Certainly their alphabet, unlike the letters of the later class of Egyptian hiero-

glyphics, does not appear to consist of merely a few survivors from a whole army

of symbols. On the contrary, it seems to present some traces of arrangement ; for

the objects representing the letters appear to be grouped in pairs, each comprising

two objects in some manner associated with each other; and between each pair

is inserted a third letter, represented by an object not so inmiediately connected

with those preceding it, but still not absolutely alien from them.

It would be superfluous to attempt to point out the bearings of this question of

the origin aud development of the Phtcnician alphabet on the history of civiliza-.

tion in Europe and Western Asia.

   Future discoveries may possibly bring us nearer the cradle of this alphabet ; but
it seems probable that on the Moabite stone we find the letters still retainino-

enough of their original pictorial character to justify a belief that they there occur

in a comparatively early stage, and not removed by many centuries ft-om the time

when tliey were merely delineations of the objects the names of which they have

preserved. Assumijig this to have been the case, what is the stage of culture to

Avhicli the inventors of this alphabet appear to have attained ?

They were not mere nomads or hunters, but a people with fixed dwellings for

themselves and enclosures for their cattle ; they were acquainted with agriculture,

and had domesticated animals, and employed the ox as a beast of draught to cul-

tivate fields, the produce of which they reaped with metallic sickles. In feet

their civilization would seem to have been at least equal to that of the bronze-

using people of the Swiss lake-dwellings.

      A Puta-])atoo from New Zt'cdand. By Sir Duncan Gidh, Bart.

Pacific. It was obtained in the Society Islands, but bad come originally from
Ne\7 Zealand, and, althougli of recent manufacture, now extremely difficult to obtain.
Tlie present example was composed of dark-green basalt smoothly polished,
12 inches long, and weighed I5 lb., thus forming a powerful weapon for striking
the top of the head. Indeed the alleged use to which it was put by the inhabi-
tants was to dispatch old people when they became infirm (their parents for
example), by a blow in the middle of the top of the skull inflicted from behind
when it was least expected. This blow was sufficient to split the skull, and death
was instantaneous. The hard and compact nature of the stone rendered it a safe
weapon to accomplish its end. This terrible custom, which the author's friend
learned had been at one time prevalent, has long ceased to be practised ; no
account of it appears in Capt. Cook's voyages, although he brought several of the

weapons in stone and bone to England now preserved in tlie British Museum.
In the Museum there were eleven pata-patoos (three of them bone), and in the
Christie collection also eleven (two of them bone), the largest being 18 inches

long and the heaviest 3 lbs. in weight.

                                  Stone Implements and Fragments of Pottery from Canada,

                                                     By Sir Duncan Gibb, Bart.

The author referred to the discovery of stone implements and pottery throughout

Canada, of various degrees of antiquity, the most recent being stone gouges,

chisels, hammers, and domestic utensils. Arrow-heads and spears were more ancient,

as they were not met with in recent sepultures, but generally were found on the

surface of ploughed land. The implements which he had collected himself in

Canada consisted of sixteen arrow-heads, two ilat spears, and two axes. The

spears were composed of chert, and were from the Saguenaye district, the largest

being 4^ inches long by 2 -Rdde ; they were well formed, flat, and thin. The axes

were of polished green micaceous schist, wedge-shaped, from 85 to 4 inches long

and f of                     an   inch thick                                                   weight 7j and 4 oimces :  found  at Niagara.  The arrows

                          ;

arrows were obtained were Montreal, tbe Saguenaye, Pointe du Ciienes on the

Ottawa river, Chippewa, Niagara, William Henry, and Quebec ; the greater num-

ber were composed of chert ; one was of red slate, another of white quartz : on the

whole they differed in form from the arrows found in the British Islands. As

.arrows were frequently found at Chippewa, it was evidently the site of some

ancient battle-field, as no flakes nor chips were found associated with them. He

also described three fragments of pottery, from the shores of Lake Erie and

Montreal, all imperfectly baked. Looking upon the stone arrows and spears as the

most ancient stone implements found in Canada, if not in America, the author was

disposed to place the period of their use and manufacture at about 200 years before

the Christian era, corresponding to the time that our forefathers in the British

Isles might have used such things as weapons or objects of the chase. Neverthe-

less, if the time was considered at which the aboriginal inhabitants of America

were traversing that continent and required some weapon as a means to kill game

to subsist upon, 4000 years could not be looked upon as too remote ; and as the

arrow is the most primitive and the simplest implement we have any knowledge

of, the author said it may be reasonabty considered to have been employed by the

inhabitants of Canada at that time, as well as probably over other parts of the

North-American Continent,

with tables in front made of bamboo ; and this has led the author to think that

these ver}^ perishable constructions gave rise to the erection of the raouolltli and

setting them up being- as a propitiation of good fortune. Setting up curiously

This paper was confined to a description of the round barrows and their con-

tents. In general form these barrows are either conical or bowl-shaped. It is pro-

bable that many had originally an encircling mound or a ditch, or both, at the base

but if such were the case, all traces of these enclosures have been destroyed. The

barrows were constructed of the materials nearest at hand, more commonly of earth

than of chalk. They are usually associated in groups, but a single barrow is not

imcommon. As a rule, they have been erected on high ground. Holes are often

found imder tlie mounds, sunk below the natural surface of the soil the author

suggests that these may probably have been the receptacles of food or other perish-

able material. Animal bones are usually scattered through the mounds, and appear

to 1)6 the remains of feasts : flints and potsherds also occur among the materials of

the barrows. The bodies buried tmder the mounds occur at various levels, the

central burial being usually in a grave excavated in the chalk. Generally there is

nothing to protect the body from the pressiu-e of the overlying soil, interments in

cists being almost entirely unknown in the Wolds. Earely the body has been

protected by a coffin formed of a hollow tree-trunk. The remains of the body,

when burnt, are sometimes enclosed in a urn. Secondary interments are common,

and the bodies previotislj' biu-ied have been thereby disturbed and the bones scat-

tered. Some cases of apparent disturbance suggest the idea that the flesh may

have been removed from the bones before burial, and the naked bones deposited in

tlie barrow. In some instances the btirials were by inhumation, in others after

cremation, the former practice being by far the more common in the Wolds. The

one process does not appear to have                                                                been older than the other                                                                                                                       nor has the difi'er-

ence in question been one of social rank or of sex. In cases of biu'ial by inhuma-

tion, the unburnt body is always found lying on the side in a contracted position,

with the knees drawn up towards the head. This was evidently not due to the

requirements of space, but must have originated in some settled principle, tlie

meaning of which is not understood, but which appears to have been common to

all mankind at a certain stage of development. Perhaps it was in imitation of the
natural posture assumed in sleep when the individual sought warmth. The direc-

--tion of the body seems to follow no rule. Some barrows are found empty the

so-called cenotaphs ; but the author believes that in most cases such barrows have

not been exhaustively searched; if really empty, he believes this due to docav of

the skeleton, and not to the mound having been originally unoccupied. Charcoal

is generally found associated with unburnt bodies; and the author suggests that this

maybe the remains of the fire through which the corpse was passed, when actuallv

burning tlie dead had become to some extent a merely representative custom. If

this be so, cremation must have been universal, even v\-itii tho.?e bodies which are

apparently unburnt. It is lilcely that the unburnt bodies -were laid in the gra\e

limited ; indeed, from the paucity of bronze implements and weapons, it is con-
cluded that the barrows belong to a period before that alloy came into g-eneral use.
It is notable that the articles in flint found in immediate contact with the bodies

appear in most cases to be perfectly new, and as if made expressly for the burial
while those which are not found in association with an interment generally show
signs of having been in use. In 248 burials by inhumation and after cremation,
39 had articles of flints or other stone, 10 of bronze, and 3 of horn. Orna-
ments and objects of personal decoration are occasionally found with the burials in
the barrows, but are apparently confined to women. Out of the 248 burials only
6 possessed such objects ; no gold, glass, or amber has been found ; and, indeed, tlie
whole of the evidence attbrded by the barrows tends to show that they were the
burial-place of a people in an humble condition, possessing but little wealth, and
ha\-ing but limited intercourse with other parts of the country. Vessels of earthen-
ware frequently accompany the bodies buried in the barrows. Out of 248 burials,
69 were associated with pottery; and 7 of these vessels were cinerary urns holding
the ashes of the dead. The vessels vary greatly in size, shape, quality of paste, and
style of ornamentation. All the pottery is hand-made, imglazed, imperfectly balsed
at an open fire and not in a kiln. Broken stone is usually mingled with the clay.
The ornamentation is confined to lines, generally straight lines. The author
maintains that these vessels were not pieces of domestic pottery used in dail}' life,
but were manufactured solely for sepulchral purposes. On the other hand, many of
the potsherds scattered among the materials of the mound appear to be fragments
of domestic pottery. Some idea of the diet of the early Wold-dwellers is de-

rived from a study of the bones scattered through the barrows. These bones are
referable to 2ios lonyifrons, to an ox whicli was probably a cross between this
species and the Urus, to the pig, the goat or sheep, the horse and the dog. Domesti-
cated animals thus formed the main support of these people. Bones of the red deer

are also, but very rarely, found. From the evidence afforded by the barrows it appears
that the early inhabitants of the Yorksliire Wolds must have lived in an organized

state of society, that they possessed domesticated animals and cultivated grain,
that they manufactured woollen and porliaps linen fabrics, and that they had
attained considerable skill in metallurgy and were acquainted with the manufac-
ture of pottery, though ignorant of the potter's wheel. It is believed that it was
their custom to bury with the dead the wives and children of the deceased, and
perhaps their slaves. The round barrows yield both dolichocephalic and brachy-
cephalic skulls. The short-headed race were taller, more strongly built, and harsher
in features than were the long-headed people. AVith regard to the age of the round
barrows, the author feels safe in not attributing to them too high an antiquity by
referring them to a period which centres more or less in B.C. 1000.

Tlu'orles regarding Intellect and Instinct, ivltli an attempt to deduce a satls-

  fdctonj conclusion therefrom. Bg George Harris, F.S.A., Vice-President

    of the Anthropological Institute.

   The author gave a concise summary of the opinions of Aristotle, Viigll, Origen,
St. Augustine, Be la Chambre, Dss Cartes, Ilobbes, Willis, Sir Matthew Hale,
Dr. Henry More, Cudworth, Locke, Sir Isaac Newton, Priestley, Buflbn, Dean,

Dugald Stewart, Smellie, Sir W. Lawrence, Mr. A. Smee, Mr. Isaac Taylor, Mr.

Herbert Spencer, Prof, de Quatrefages, and some otlier authorities ; and observed
that widely as these great authorities appear to differ one from another in their
opinions, their several tenets are by no means irreconcilable, and the theories pro-
pounded by each are calculated to aid in arriving at a satisfactory conclusion as to
the entire subject. Intellect and instinct, he thought, were like two countries, in

many of their main features and productions nearly resembling each other,
while in other respects they are strikingly and totally dissimilar. They
differ essentially as regards the topics they embrace and their mode of

dealing with these topics. Instinct only applies itself to matter so far as sensa-
tion proceeding from it conduces to "this end ; while Intellect not only takes

cognizance of it in tliis manner, but proceeds to Tarious operations quite beyond

tliese, of a far higher nature, and embracing the consideration of moral and abstract

topics. In many cases animals are directly and uniformly impelled to do certain

actions, in which they are guided mainly by sensation, and to their excellence in

which they owe the perfect manner in which these operations are carried on. But

in addition to this blind impulse, they exhibit a capacity of remembering, and de-

liberating, and reasoning to a certain extent and ou certain matters, although they

are utterly incapable of acquiring any of the sciences of reading, writing, or even

speaking. Instinct is perfect as regards the ends for which it is adapted, but it is

limited to these ends. Intellect has a far more extensive sphere, in which, however,

Ait is far less perfect and unerring.  power of deliberating, as evinced by certain

animals, seems almost necessarily to imply their endowment with some sort of im-

--material being, analogous, although very inferior, to the soul in man an opinion

held by some of the distinguished philosophers whose opinions he cited.

   Mr. T. M'^K. Hughes exhibited a series of fragments of chert which he had col-
lected below a chert-bearing limestone on Ingleborough in Yorkshire. He explained
how tlie chert got shivered as the limestone broke up along its outcrop, and the

edges of fragments sticking out of the rainwash or drift clay got chipped by stones
rolling down the slopes, by trampling, sheep, &c., while the frost finished the work.

He pointed out that man seems generally to have dressed the edge of a flint by

blows or pressure of somewhat equal intensity ; whereas, except in rare instances,

the chips taken off by nature varied according to the size of the falling stones, &c.,

and the position of the fragment being chipped.

  He had made this collection since examining the flints in the museum at
St. Germains, which are supposed by some to indicate the existence of man in the

Miocene Period in France, but which he considered should be referred to some

such agency as that he had just described.

On some Bone and otJw Implements from the Oaves of Perigord, France,

   hearing marhs indicative of Ownership, Tallying, or Gambling. By Prof.

   T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S., F.G.S.

  A knife-like ivory plate, marked with regular pits, marginal notches, and groups

of lateral scorings, from the Gorge d'Enfer, opposite Les Eyzies, on the Vezere,
was the chief implement described and commented on. It is supposed by the
author to have reference possibly to some gambling-transactions of the aborigines,
as North-American Indians and others score their play on sticks and bones.

   The shape, systematic pittings, crenulated edge, and scorings on this specimen
were compared with known instances of such markings on ancient and modern
implements of savage make. The author recognized simple and compound scorings
and notches, similar to those made by Eskimo on their harpoons, as owner-marks
on several weapons of bone from the French caves. Some which appear to be
tally-marks, and several bearing either poison-grooves or capricious and aimless
cutting and dotting, were also described and commented on.

       Western Antliropohgists and extra-Western Communities.

                       By JosErn Ivaines, M.A.I. 6j-c.

The author commenced by asking, " What are the duties of Western Anthro-

pologists to the less civilized communities of mankind ?" In answering it, he

said he should put out of sight altogether all considerations of a purely material

sort, and look only at the normal aspects of the subject. He argued that the

existence of the science of Anthropology depended on the preservation of the

less civilized, since little or no knowledge of human evolution or development

could be obtained but through them ; and the past history of mankind, espe-

cially of the races more advanced in civilization, could be understood only by

1872.                                  14

present exist.

    The result of Western contact, whetlier commercial or philanthropic, were
dwelt upon at large, and shown to he so hurtful, that they were the chief (if not
the only) external causes of the dyino' out of the backward peoples. Numerous
illustrations in support of this were given. A^'estern civilization, in its relations,
past or present, with China, India, Japan, besides other places, was reviewed, and
its unfitness was illustrated; in support of which conclusion references were made
to and quotations were given from the writings of Mr. A. R. Wallace, Captain
E. S. Burton, Mr. Wiuwood lleade, Lord Elgin, and others.

    In conclusion, the author argued tliat the "duty of Western anthropologists to
the backward peoples is that, recommended by Auguste Comte, of protection.
Anthropologists should urge upon the Western governments the policy of pre-
serving the backward peoples, and of protecting them against the cruel and lawless
of whatever colour or race.

Discovery of a Flint- Implement Station in WisJimoor Ihitom, near Sandhurst

                          By Lieut. C. Coopek King, li.M.A.

    The author described the discovery of several isolated groups of flint flakes in
 limited areas in Wishmoor Bottom, near Sandhiu-st, one "find" including a
 large number of flakes with several cores and two implements of palfeolithic
 type. The marshy deposit with the flints occupies a minor cul-dc-sac valley;

 and a small isolated hill in its opening has sheltered the station from the great
 east and west road line which runs near it. The flint from which the implements
 were made appears not to be the flint of the neighbourhood, but must have been
 brought from a distance. It was suggested that the area in which the discoveries

were made may have been a small lake at tlie period of its occupation by an abori-
 ginal race, and the small groups of flints may be the sole remnants of an ancient

 lake-dwelling.

    The Pretended Identification of the English Nation with the "Lost House

                          of Israel." By A. L. Lewis, M.A.I.

  On the SJceleton of the Red Bods. By M. MoGGEibdi;, F.G.S., F.B.Hist.S.

    On the seashore two miles east of Mentone is a range of lofty clifl's, called the

 Eochers Eouges. They are composed of Jurassic limestone, and abound in caverns.

 A photogTaph showed their general character ; and the cave most to the right,

 which is 103 feet above the sea, is that in which the skeleton (which has
 been dignified by several appellations) was discovered recently by Dr. Eiviere,

 who is emplojed by the French government to make excavations for fossils along

 this coast (though in fact these rocks are in Italy), and whose skill and perseve-
 rance have brought to light many A'aluable .specimens.

    This cave, which has been subjected to many previous explorations, at the mouth
 nine feet deep, was filled up to the modern floor with earth, unr/iilar stones, flints
 worked by man, some charcoal, and the remains of diverse animals. As was shown
 in the photograph, the skeleton was lying upon the left side, in an attitude sucli as
 might have Ijeen assumed in sleep. It was eight feet below the modern floor at

 that part of the cave, nine feet from the entrance, lying north and south, and the
 head was to the south. Eye-teeth of the deer and small shells, both pierced,

 encircled the skull possibly they may have ornamented a fillet ; many fell off
                                                                                                  ;

 before the photograph was taken. In contact with the body flint instruments had
 been placed ; and a circle or rather oval was formed around by rude stones in juxla-
 positiou. With oue end touching the closed teeth, and projecting fronr the mouth
 as if that end had been placed within the lips, was a mass of metallic grains (oxide
 of iron), four inches long and one inch wide, of which a sample was shown. Such
 substance does not occiu- in tlie neighbourhood, and tlie author knows no parallel

case. May it have been a fetish or charm ? The shin-bone is Hat, as in the

skeletons touncl by i\Ir. Busk at Gibraltar.

    Passing to the interior, the rock at the bottom descends to a lower level. In

those recesses occur the remains of Ursus spdarts, Hyana spelcca, Rhinoceros, &c.

Thus if the skeleton does not carry us back to tlie days of the extinct animals
(unless the deer may be of an extinct species), it is a very interesting relic of the

"Flint Age." It may, however, be asked, How are we to fix the termination of

that ago ? Does it not vary with the approach to civilization of dift'erent races ?
To this day with the Esquimaux that age has not terminated.

   The immediate neighbourhood of this cave does, however, afford proof that
man %vas contemporaneous with the extinct beasts, as the author showed at
Edinburgh, where he stated that at a depth of thirty feet, in breccia (formed of

angular stones, luted together by carbonate of lime and oxide of iron, and so solid

that it could only be worked by blasting), he had himself taken out the remains of

Ursus spelanis &c. in contact with flints worked by man, which may now be seen

in the temporary museum.
   The author concluded with testifying to the zeal, talent, and laudable perseve-

rance of Dr. Riviere, the gentleman who discovered this highly interesting skeleton.

          On the Ethnohcjical Affi,nities of tlie French and English Peoples.

                          By Dr. T. Nicholas, M.A., F.G.S.

   Having assumed that Britain had been first peopled from Gaul, a fact partly
substantiated by Cajsar, the author proceeded to inquire into those changes, or
supposed changes, of race-character which various conquests had brought upon both

peoples. Having intimated that the Roman occupation of several hundred years

had resulted in greater race-admixture on both sides of the Channel than was
usually allowed, the author argued, from a rapid glance at the Frankish conquest
of Gaul by Clovis, and the second conquest by Pepin and Charlemagne, that they
had not very extensively imbued the Gallic population with Frankish blood, and,
in like manner, that tiae parallel conquest of Britain by the Germans, usually
known as the Saxon Conquest, had only very partially converted the people of
Britain into Anglo-Saxons, except in name. The Britons, instead of having been,
according to the popular representation based on the ' De excidio Britannias ' of the
supposititious Gildas, exterminated or bodily expelled the country, had in time
coalesced with the invaders and become one people. This was the only way in
which seven or eight populous sovereignties could be furnished with subjects in
so short a time. Before the descent upon Neustria by Rollo, and the conquest of
England by the Danes and Normans, therefore, the Celtic character of the mass of
the French people had not been greatly changed, and the people of England were in
all probability less German than Celtic. It followed that the term "Anglo-Saxon"
could only be applied to the English in the same unscientific way as the term
" Franks" (French) was applied to the substantially Gallic inhabitants of Gaul,
and always involved a distortion of the truth. The Norman Conquest was achieved
by an army presumably more Gallic than Norman, and had therefore only added
to the Celtic blood of England; while the Norman conquest of Neustria had
affected but a small fraction of the French, and affected that fraction ethnically
but very slightly. The conclusion, therefore, fi-om this parallel, as from the other
parallels in the history of the two nations, was, that they have continued to
partake largely of Celtic blood, although not so largely as in pre-Roman times.
The English, less Teutonized than was usually supposed hj the Anglian and
Jutish incursions, had, during the Danii?h and Norman periods, been rendered con-
siderably less Celtic than their neighbours across the Channel. The physical
characteristics of the French, as determined bj' Broca, Edwards, and others, and
some of their mental and social characteristics, were pointed out as constituting

points of difference between them and the English. On the whole, the claims to

sympathy and amity which, on ethnological grounds, the two nations had on each
other were held by the author to be strong.

193 REPORT--1872,

Notice of a Sillcified Forest in the Rocky Mountains, with an account of

   a supposed Fossil Chip. By H, Alleyne Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc,

   F.R.S.E., Professor of Natural History in University College, Toronto.

The object of this communication was to describe two specimens which had

recently been presented to tlie Museum of Toronto University, Canada, by Mr.

Worthington of that city. One of the specimens is a large fragment of silicified

wood obtained by that gentleman from a fossil forest in the Hocky Mountains.

This forest is situated not far from Colorado city, at a supposed height of seven

thousand feet above the sea, in the neighbourhood of the mountain known aa

Pike's Peak, not far from Ute Pass. The forest covers a large area, the trees

standing apparently on the margins of an ancient lake. The stumps vary from

three to four feet in height, and from ten to twenty feet or more in diameter, and

there can be but little doubt as to their being the remains of a forest of the Sequoia

Agigantea, which still lives in California.  similar forest was described by Professor

Marsh near Mount St. Helena, the age of which was shown to be later Pliocene ; so

that there is every probability that the antiquity of the present forest is the same.

Another specimen is one of extreme interest, if only exact details were obtain-

able as to the circumstances under which it was found. It appears to be one

of many specimens which was picked up on the ground close to the stump of

one of these large trees ; and it presents all the appearances of a fossil chip struck
from the living tree by the hand of man. The author showed that every particular

in this specimen corresponded exactly with what is observable in an ordinary chip

cut from a standing tree by an experienced axe-man. This is especially the case

with the upper surface of the specimen, which presents a clean obliquely descend-

ing face, cutting across the fibres of the wood, and even exhibiting tlie unequal

shrinking of the different layers of wood, which is invariably observable whenever
soft wood is divided in this manner by a sharp instrument. Actual chips in every

respect undistinguishable from this specimen could be obtained anywhere in the

backwoods in Canada; and it seems impossible to doubt that it really was a chip

cut from one of these ancient trees. The chief difficulty in the way of this view is

the fact that the surfaces of incision are too clean to have been made by any thing

except a metal implement. It was impossible, however, to determine from the

data in hand what might be the date at which tliis fossil was silicified.

On some Evidences suggestive of a Common Migration from the East, shown

   hy Archaic Remains in America and Britain. By John S. PnEXlt, F.S.A.,

    F.O.S., F.R.G.S., F.R.I.B.A.

   The author first refen-ed to a paper read by him last year at the Meeting held
at Edinburgli, in which he had drawn attention to some remarkable mounds in
North Britain, which he considered were identical with the serpent and alligator

mounds of America. He stated that since that Meeting -he had opened the most

perfect of these British mounds, and with very satisfactory and interesting results
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

but as the particulars of the investigation had been published both by himself and

also by Aliss Constance F. Gordon Cummiug (in 'Good Words,' with an illustra-

tion), he should pass on to other matter.

   He then showed from drawings by several artists, including the names of

Mr. C. J. Lewis and Miss Gordon Gumming, by photographs, and by different
models taken by Mr. Mortimer Evans, C.E., F.G.S., of Glasgow, the peculiar
formation of the mound.

   He pointed out various difficulties he had mot with in coming to an accurate

decision about the mound, but how, finnlly, he found, on reducing it to scale and
taking the various levels, that it agreed al'most entirely with the Egyptian Urajus

and the Phrenician Serpent deity, each of which is represented in relics now

extant as in the precise position of the form of tlie mound, and each witli the solar
disk at its head, -nhich is found to correspond exactly with tlie cairn formerly

described as the head, but which is now found to be in the position of resting upon

it, assuming the figure were placed vertically instead of horizontally.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                              193

Tlie author next proceeded to show that his observations on this point also

explained the only anibig'iiity in the case of the great American serpent mound at

Ohio, which he also argued is surmounted by the solar orb, thereby agreeing with

the Egyptian, Phoenician, and, as he claims, British representations also.

  He then illustrated his subject by a great many examples of customs in the

mode of constructing this class of monuments common to several countries, espe-

cially modes of excavation, carving into form, and erection, ·which he found agreed

in each case in Egypt, America, and Britain ; and from these he argued a common
origin, custom, and migration. He quoted Mr. Fergusson to show that the theory

he advanced was the mo.st probable course by which America could have been

visited by the mound-builders of the east of Europe^ and who might also with

equal reason have spread to Britain.

He then quoted a number of authorities to show that the words OB, meaning ser-

pent, and ON, meaning sun, represented the sun and serpent deity commonly wor-

shipped in Egypt and Phoenicia; that the same word, with the addition of the letter

I, is found in Africa : OBION and OBONI both represented serpent and solar deities

which were worshipped by some tribes in a visible and sensual manner and by

some in a spiritual sense. He showed how rare places with these component

--names are one only in Europe (Britain excepted), four or five in Asia, where the

worship of the sun and serpent still continues, those already quoted in Africa, and

one only in America directly*; but he proceeded to show that some of the Ame-

rican names in the districts of the ancient mounds assimilated very nearly to these,

making- allowances for no gi-eater variation than had taken place in the form of

names in their- transmission from Greece to Rome, and concluded his argument by

claiming for Oban (the town near where the Argyllshire mound is) the name of the

place of the servient and solar deity, AB-ON or OB-AN, which he quoted autho-

EBOE OBOErities to show were used indifferently, as
                                                                               and  are in Africa having

--that meaning pointing out also that the Israelites called their first encampment,
after the making- of the brazen serpent, OBOTH.

Eeference was made to some Egyptian representations of taking human life by

official power as shown in the illustrations, in which the solar serpent deity or Urseus

figures as an authority for the act ; and the author stated that since his discovery of

the mound a Gaelic tradition had been put before him, which the natives state be-

longs to this mound in p.irticular, andwhich identifies it as a place of public execution

in the early British or Druidical times. The Hindu mythology records a similar

serpent mound produced bj'  Krishna                                   but  in  this case the serpent  was  said to be
                                                                   ;

living, although shaped almost exactly like the Argyllshire mound ; but it was

remarkable that into the head of this serpent people and animals went with

Krishna for refuge : this the author took to mean self-immolation and the satis-

faction arising- from dedication to the deity ; and finally quoted Mr. Fergusson to

show that the principal essential wanting, in his opinion, to constitute the British

monuments places of sacrifice was present in the case of the Argyllshire mound.

                               Btj Professor Eolleston, M.D., F.B.S.

   Professor Piolleston gave an account of a large number of detailed measure-
ments of the skulls obtained by Canon Greenwell in his excavations, and now pre-

sented by him to the Oxford University Museum. He observed that his examina-

tion of the skidls had been carried on without any reference, in most cases, and

without any knowledge in many, of their archa3ological surroundings. Two types

of skull, the same two as had been described by Dr. Thm-nam in his well-known

papers, were to be found in the series submitted to him. iSkulls of the dolicho-
cephalic type were frequently, however, found to bear the same label as skidls of
the brachycephalic, and might be presumed therefore to have come from the same
barrows. If it should turn out to be the fact that these two kinds of skull had
been found with the same archjeological sm-roundings, this would be a different

condition of things from that which had been described by the trustworthy author
ah-eady referred to as existing- in Wiltshire, and would have to be explained either
as being the result of an intermixture of the two races peacefully, or as the mani-
festation of a tendency to A'ariation not unparallelled even in wild tribes. The form

of cranium which Retzius had called the ·' Common Celtic form" (see 'Journal

of Anatomy,' vol. iii. p. 254, 1868) was almost entirely absent in this series. The
same remarks applied to the form of cranium known as the " Borris Type " (see
Huxley in ' Prehistoric Remains of Caithness,' p. 128).

On the Wedclo of Oe)/lon. By Professor Rollestox, M.D., F.E.S.

Professor Rolleston exhibited ten photographs of the Jungle Weddo, taken by

B. F. Hartshorne, Esq., as also three skulls of the same tribe procured by the same

gentleman, and some skulls of certain Kolarian tribes procured by II. Duthoit, Esq.,

of Mrzapore, and exhibited for the sake of comparison with those of the Ceylon

aborigines. There was no doubt about the genuineness of the three Weddo

skidls                              yet one of the three was as markedly brachycephalic (the cephalic index
                                 ;

being 81) as the others, or as Weddo skulls usually, were dohchocephalic. The

]Mr. Sabonnadiere to the Oxford University Museum, the cephalic indices were

respectively 72, G8, and 64. The cubic capacity in each of the two dolichocephalic

crania sent by Mr. Ilartshorne was 85-25 cubic inches and 80 cubic inches re-

spectively                                                 the cubic capacity of the single brachycephalic specimen was, approxi-

have had nothing to do with the briiiging about of the aberrances of the brachy-
cephalic Weddo cranium

obliterated, the veiy condition which, if the shape of the skull had ruled the

shape of the brain instead of the reverse, would have produced dolichocephaly.

The presence of parietal occipital flattening on the left side (a deformity uninten-

tionally produced during early life by the mode of cai-rving the infant) was also

noteworthy as being rarely observed except in brachvcephalous skulls. With re-

ference to the large question of the affinities of the Dravidian races of Continental

India to the AVeddo of Ceylon, Professor Rolleston referred to the papers on Indian

Ethnology piiblished in the ' Journal of the Ethnological Society,' July 1869 by

         Beluj'wus Cairns of the Himalayan Region. By R. B. Shaav.

  AH through the Himalayan region, the slopes of the Dhaola Dhar inhabited by

high-caste Hindus, on the barren plains and in the roclry valleys of Tibet amou"-
the Buddhist hill-men, and in the gorges of the Kuenlun Mountains until they
debouch upon the plains of Turkistan, there are to be found cairns of a similar
description and placed in similar situations. The crests of passes, the summits of
isolated points of rock, or any other place from which a remarkable view is obtained
of a mighty peak or a terrific precipice are the positions they generally occupy.
Throughout the whole of this region they are adorned in a similar way, beino- stuck
over with tall sticks, from which wave rags and flags and tails of horse or yak, the

votive ofierings of passers by.

  When we find that these cairns, similar in character and similar in position, are

to be found throughout regions inhabited by men of three diferetit races and three
different reh(ji07is, who each ascribe to them a different origin and a different pur-
pose, the importance of the subject is evident. No one who has observed carefully
the facts on the spot is likely to doubt that the monuments in the several districts
in question were all erected with the same intent, whatever that was. The posi-
tion of most of them forbids the supposition that they can have been landmarks
or tombs. The labour bestowed in fetching the stones, often from along distance,

shows that they had some serious purpose. But the author can conceive of no

common purpose which can have induced men of such dissimilar religions as tlie
Iliudu, the Buddhist, and the Mussulman to erect similar monuments.

   One supposition suggested itself, which was that these cairns are monuments of

the Buddhist faith, which is the only one known to have ever prevailed over the
entire region of Tihet aud Turkista'n. But there is this objection, that although

similar monuments are found in the Buddhist districts, yet they exist in opposition
to the Buddhist priesthood, who will have nothing to do with them, and thus are

not likely to have implanted them in other districts.

   The author thinks that he recognized in these cairns the remains of an early
kind of wor.^hip (anterior to Buddhism) which undoubtedly existed at one time
throughout those hills, and which perhaps overspread the entire region between

India and Turkistan. There are traces of the adoration of local deities all over
this region. In the outer Himalaya such sacred spots are numerous, and occupy

exactly similar positions with the "Lhato" of Tibet and the "Mazars"' of the
KuenUm Mountains, viz. eminences and remarkable places. The influence of
these divinities is not supposed to extend beyond a few hundred yards from their

local habitation, which is marked also by red paint, rusty iron tridents, aud flutter-
ing rags. Outside the magic circle the worshippers will often mock at the object
of then- adoration, but within it they are all devotion. These supernatural beings

are generally called after " Devi," the Hindu goddess of destruction, who seems to be

indetinitely subdivided or multiplied by lier worshippers in the hills, contrary, as the
author was informed, to the orthodox practice of pure Hinduism. They talk of this

m\i and that Devi as Italians do of the Madonna of such or such a place, honour-

ing some more than others, as Louis XI. was wont to do in the familiar pages

of'^Yalter Scott.

   Besides the Devis there are numerous other local worships in the Hindu part of
the Himalaya ; and, with a change in the names, we have just the same in Tibet and
in Eastern Turkistan. Moreover at the boundaries or the neutral ground between

the three religions we find the very same cairns or symbols of local influences
worshipped in common by the followers of both the neighbouring Faiths, who

bestow each their own designation on the same object.
   Those monuments and localities which the Hindus associate with the name of

" Devi," " Indur," &c. are in Tibet called " Lhato " (Lha meaning a god or super-
natural power, as in Lhassa, which means " the abode of the gods ").

   In the Mussulman districts, on the other hand, these cairns are known by the
name of " Mazar," which means the shrine or tomb of a saint; and such is the
origin they ascribe to them, regardless of the improbability of so many holy men

retiring to the tops of almost inaccessible rocks to be buried.
    Several times the author found abandoned cairns in most desolate and uufre-

cairns as " Mazars," though in every respect resembling those which they revered

so much. They told him that these mounds had been raised by a race who frequented

that country long before tJiej/ had migrated into it. In fact they had no certain

tradition ; and they are but new comers themselves.
   Some Yarkandis who were questioned, stated that these were "Kafir" or

" infidel " monuments, and that similar ones were to be foimd throughout Eastern

Turkistan but not in Western.                                              ,

Af-ain, the Tibetans who accompanied the author into Turkistan immediately
identified both the honom-ed and also the abandoned "Mazars" as their own country's

" Lhato." One in particular attracted their attention. It was in a level part of the

upper Karakash valley,  and  there  seemed to be no  reason    for  its existence there
                                                                                                                                                          ;

until at last one of them spied out a remarkable peak in the distance, which first

came into sight at the point where the cairn was erected. This peak had a triple

point ; and this, the author was informed, woidd in Tibet have been quite sufficient
to ensure even the most distant view of such a summit the honour of being marked

of mountain-demons (including in the Himalaya the veneration of tree- and water-
demons, other natural divinities of which many traces remain), then the three
newer religions which have since occupied this region, the Hindu, the Buddhist

and the Mussulman, have each adopted this part of the old belief and assimilated

it into its own system. It is curious to see their difierent treatment of the same
belief. The Hindu gives the most supernatural turn to it. All these spots, how-
ever mmierous or distant, have become the special habitation of one and the same
divinity of the Hindu Pantheon, who by the common people is conceived as being
entirely separate and distinct deities. The Mussulman gives a purely human and

ordinary explanation : certain holy men have died and been_ buried there. The

Buddhist, on the other hand, leaves the old superstition alone, giving it a wide berth.

The country people pay their devotions to these cairn-deities to ward off their dis-

pleasure from their fields and cattle ; but the Lama gives them no place in his
books or in his worship. His veneration is reserved for the deified saints of Budd-

hism, following each in his proper rank after the great Sakya-Moonee. It is true

the Lamas sometimes help their superstitious countrymen with charms against the

power of these cairn-deities and of  other evil spirits, such as  the serpent demon
                                                                                                                                       ;

but this is probably illicit connivance.

The fact is that all over these mountains, under one excuse or another, the

country people propitiate certain localized influences, which are supposed to be

confined within certain limits. For instance, the inhabitants of an hamlet are not

supposed to pay any attention to the object of their neighbours' fear or veneration,

unless they place themselves locally within its power. The Mussulman bestows

the least superstition on them, and the Buddhist gives them the smallest amount of

recognition and sanction.

The author mentioned a ceremony which he witnessed in Ladak, and which is

Aprobably a relic of the supposed ante-Buddhist worship.          certain female deity

or demon is supposed to be revealed each year at the village of Sh6, embodied iu

one or other of the members of a certain family who hold this heritage. The in-

dividual chosen by the goddess on this occasion was dressed out in fantastic though

costly garments with a regal tiara on his head, and when first seen was dancing in

a weird fashion on the lofty battlements of one of the Buddhist monasteries, which

are often so picturesquely perched on the top of a steep clifi". On this dizzy emi-

nence the goddess danced in human form, while in a little green plain below a dense

crowd watched every motion with upturned faces. At last the mystic personage

descended. Making his way through the crowd, he approached a spring of water

which bubbles up in the midst of the little plain, converting half of it into a swamp,

which can only be crossed by a stone causeway. This causeway terminates at the

spring, and on its extremity stands one of these stone erections called Lhato, but of

a more finished character than those before described. On the Lhato a dish of

burning incense was placed ; and as the inspired mortal paced up and down in its
fumes, many of the crowd approached one by one and asked him questions regard-

ing futuritj', which by the power of the goddess he was supposed capable of

answering correctlj^.

  Now iu all this there was one noticeable fact. Although in Tibet the Lamas

iisually form as large a part of a crowd as monks and priests used to do in Naples

and Home, yet on this occasion not a single Lama was visible. Not one could be

found to sanction by his presence the worship of this local deity.

The author has witnessed almost similar devil-dances amongst the Hindu hill-

men of the outer Himalaya. There, however, more than one person takes part in

the ceremony, which is generally performed before the rude shrine of one of these

Alocal deities or of the snake god the Nag.  sudden Bacchic fury seems to seize

individual members of the crowd, who rush forward, trembling in every limb, and

with glaring eyes, and baring the upper part of their body as they go, they dance

round, lashing their backs with a sort of iron cat-o'-nine tails, which is handed round

froni one to the other. In this state they are consulted by the standers bj-, who

receive their words as oracles. Sometimes ten or a dozen of these devotees are
hopping around the circle at the same moment. Their excitement is undoubt-

edly accompanied with something resembling an hysterical affection, which
leaves them faint and exhausted. "When they reach this stage, their friends stand

he was performing.

On the delation of the Parish Boundaries in the South-east of Enyland to
  yreat Physical Features, particidarly to the ChcdJc JEscarpment. By W.

ToPLET, F.6.S., Geological Survey of England and Wales.

The author first drew attention to the fact that the outcroppings of various

strata are marked by the occurrence thereon of numerous villages, whilst some

neighbouring formations have none. Good water, a soil fit for arable culture, and

a dry site were usually found in these situations. The chalk area of England waa

described, and it was shown that every where along the foot of the "chalk escarp-

ment " a line of villages occurred. The parishes belonging to these villages in

nearly everj' case ascend the escarpment, taking in more or less of the plateau

above ; it is very rare, indeed, to find a village on the chalk plateau sending its

parish down the escarpment.

The author then described in greater detail the physical geography of the Wealden

area, and the arrangement of the villages and their parishes along its border. Every-

where below the chalk escarpment there is a line of villages, the parishes of which

ascend the escarpnient, whilst the villages above or on the chalk rarely send their

parishes down the escarpment. Of the parishes around the Wealden border, 119

conform to the nde laid down, whilst the exceptions number only six.

The Lower Greensand forms a second and iimer plateau and escarpment around the

Weald.  Along  this formation there  are  numerous villages                                                                                      but it  is remarkable
                                                                                                                                              ;

that the behaviour of their parishes to the Lower-Greensand escarpment is just the

reverse of that observed with the chalk; for here the parishes of villages upon the

plateaxi go down the escarpment, and comparatively few of the villages on the flat

below (or the Weald Clay) send their parishes up the escarpment. These and

other points discussed were illustrated by sections and large maps, in which each

parish was separately coloured.

The author contended that in the facts here described we have evidence of the

order in which the country was settled. Much of the chalk area must always

have been, as now, open land ; over this area we find numerous Celtic remains.

The first settlement would take place along the foot of the chalk escarpment; and

in the division of land resulting from these, some area of down- land would be

taken in in one direction, and wood-land or pasture in the other direction. There

would thus be a line of settlements with their appropriated lauds all along the foot

of the chalk escarpments. Later settlements took place along the Lower-Green-

sand area ; these would find the land all occupied in one direction, towards the

challc, but in the other direction, or towards the great Wealden forest, the laud

was all unappropriated. In this direction, doicn the escarpment, they therefore ex-

tended. The evidences of these later settlements may be foimd in local names.

The date of our parishes is for the most part unknown. The boundaries of those

wholly within the Weald were not settled till the century after the Conquest

these were the latest formed. The earliest, or those along the chalk escarpment,

would appear from their names to be chiefly English.

 --The author concluded his paper as follows : " In speaking as I have done of the

probable relative date of the various settlements and their parishes, I of course do

not mean that our parishes date so far back. The date at which most of our

parishes were formed, and even whether they were originall}' civil or ecclesiastical

divisions, is all involved in doubt ; and I do not pretend that this investigation

throws much light directly upon the subject. Still, I think, it does give a little.

If parishes were ever formally planned out, it seems in the highest degree unlikely
                                                                            ;

that such strikiug' agreement with the physical features as I have sliowu to exist
should occur. Probably such features would be altogether iguoied ; or if taken
iuto consideration would be seized upon as bomidaries. One could scarcely desire

a more striking physical feature for a boundary than the chalk escarpment ; but we

have seen that it is only in rare cases that this forms the boundary of a parish
generally it is well within the parish, which stretches up and often far beyond it.
The boimdaries cross the escarpment, in nine cases out of ten at right angles to it.
So again with the Lower-Greensand escarpment ; although in its relation to the
parishes it acts exactly the' reverse of the chalk escarpment, yet thej- agree iu

rarely forming parish boundaries. To this it may be answered that, whatever the

origin of parishes, whether civil or ecclesiastical, whether by grouping or sub-
dividing divisions of land previously existing, regard would necessarily be had to
the shape and extent of those divisions. This, I think, must have been the case

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and considerations advanced in this paper lead us to infer that whatever may have

been the origin of manors or parishes as such, they both depend upon still older
divisions of the land, and that these were not formed by the arbitrary act of church
or king, but resulted necessarily from the gi-eat physical features of the country."

The Origin of Serpent-Worship. Bt/ C. Stanilind Wake, M.A.I.

After referring to various facts showing the existence of serpent-worship in

many different parts of the world, the paper proceeded to consider the several ideas

associated with the serpent among ancient and modern peoples. One of its chief

characteristics  was its power  over the  wind and  rain                    another was its connexion
                                                                         ;

"with health and good fortune, in which character it was the Agathodsemon. The ser-

pent was also the symbol of life or immortality, as well as of wisdom. It was then

shown that that animal was viewed by many uncultured peoples as the re-embodi-

ment of a deceased ancestor, and that descent was actually traced by the Mexicans

and various other peoples from a serpent. The serpent superstition thus becomes a

phase of ancestor-worship, the superior wisdom and power ascribed to the denizens

of the invisible world bemg assigned also to their animal representatives. When

the simple idea of a spirit ancestor was transformed into that of the Great Spirit, the

father of the race, the attributes of the serpent would be enlarged, and it would be

thought to have power o^·er the rain and the hurricane. Being thus transformed to

the atmosphere, the serpent would come to be associated with nature, or solar-wor-

ship. Hence we find that the sun was not only a serpent god, but also the divine

ancestor or benefactor of mankind. Seth, the traditional divine ancestor of the

Semites, was the serpent sun-god, the Agathodaemon ; and various facts were cited

to establish that the legendaiy ancestor of the people classed together as Adamites

was thought to possess the same character. It would appear to follow from the

facts mentioned in the paper that serpent-worship, as a developed religious system,

originated in Central Asia, the home of the great Scythic stock, from which the

civilized races of the historical period sprung, and that the descendants of the

legendary founder of that stock, the Adamites, were in a special sense serpent-

worshippers.

and, on the other hand, tliere are many functions performed by Geographical

Societies "which we could not attempt ·without certain failure. Our peculiarities

lie in the brief duration of our existence, combined with extraordinary opportunities

for ventilating new ideas and plans, and of promoting the success of those that

deserve to succeed. AVe are constituents of a great scientific organization, which

enables us to secure the attention of representati-\'es of all branches of science to

any projects in which we are engaged; and if those projects have enough merit to

earn their deliberate approval, they are sure of the hearty and powerful support of

the whole British Association.

   These considerations indicate the class of subjects to which our brief existence

may be devoted with most profit. They are such as may lead to a definite proposal

being made by the Committee of our Section for the aid of the Association generally

and there are others, of high popular interest, which cannot be thoroughly discussed

except by a mixed assemblage, which includes persons who are keen ci'itics though

not pure geographers, and who have some wholesome irreverence for what Lord

Bacon would have called " the idols of the geographical den."

  We may congratulate ourselves that many excellent memoirs will be submitted

to us, which fulfil one or other of these conditions. They will come before us in

due order, and it is needless that I shoidd occupy your attention by imperfect

anticipations of them. But I must say that their variety testifies to the abundance

of the objects of geographical pursuit, other than exploration. There is no reason

to fear that the most interesting occupation of geographers will be gone when the
main features of all the world are known ; on the contrary, it is to be desired, in

the interests of the living pursuit of our science, that the primary facts should be

well ascertained, in order that geographers maj' have adequate materials, and more

leisure to devote themselves to principles and relations. I look forward with

eagerness to the growth of Geography as a science, in the usually accepted sense of
that word ; for its problems are as numerous, as interesting, and as intricate as
those of any other. The configuration of every land, its soil, its vegetable covering,

its rivers, its climate, its animal and human inhabitants act and react upon one

another. It is the highest problon of Geography to analyze their correlations, and

to sift the casual from the essential. The more accurately the crude facts are
known, the more surely will induction proceed, the further will it go, and, as the

analogy of other sciences assures us, the interest of its results will in no way

diminish.

   As a comparatively simple instance of this, I would mention the mutual effects
of climate and vegetation, on which we are at present very imperfectly informed,

--though I hope we shall learn much that is new and valuable during this Jleeting.

Certain general facts are familiar to us namely, tliat rain falling upou a bai-ren
country drains away immediately. It ravages the hill-slopes, rushes in torrents

over the plains, and rapidly finds its way to the sea, either by rivers or by subter-

ranean watercourses, leaving the land unrefreshed and unproductive. On the other

hand, if a mantle of forest be nursed into existence, the efiects of each rainfall are

far less sudden and transient. The water has to soak through much vegetation
and humus before it is free to run over the sm-face ; and when it does so, the

rapidity of its course is checked by the stems of the vegetation: consequently

the rain-supplies are held back and stored by the action of the forest, and the

Weclimate among the trees becomes more equable and humid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 also are familiar

knowledge of any of these data. Still less do we know about the influences of

forest and desert on the rate of passage, or upon the horizontality, of the water-

laden winds from the sea over the surface of the land ; indeed I am not aware

that this subject has ever been considered, although it is an essential element in

our problem. If we were thorough^ w^ell informed on the matters about which I
have been speaking, we might attempt to calculate the precise difference of climate

imder such and such conditions of desert and of forest, and the class of experiences

whence our data were derived would themselves furnish tests of the con-ectness of

our computations. This will serve as an example of what I consider to be the

over the phenomena of nature. Pie is not always a mere looker-on and a passive

recipient of her favours and slights ; hut he has power, in some degree, to control
her processes, even when they are working on the largest scale. The effects of

human agency on the aspect of the earth would be noticeable to an observer far
removed from it. Even were he as distant as the moon is, he could see them ; for

the colour of the siu-face of the land would have greatly varied during historic

times, and in some places the quantity and the drift of clcud would have percep-

tibly changed. It is no trifling fact in the physical geography of the globe that

vast regions to the east of the Mediterranean, and broad tracts to the south of it,

should have been changed from a state of verdure to one of aridity, and that

immense European forests should have been felled.

  We are beginning to look on our heritage of the earth much as a youth might

look upon a large ancestral possession, long allowed to run waste, A'isited recently

by him for the first time, whose boinidaries he was learning, and whose capabilities

he was beginning to appreciate. There are tracts in Africa, Australia, and at the

Poles not yet accessible to geographers, and wonders may be contained in them

but the region of the absolutely unknown is narrowing, and the career of the

explorer, though still brilUant, is inevitably coming to an end. The geographical

work of the future is to obtain a truer knowledge of the world : I do not mean by

accumulating masses of petty details, which subserve no common end, but by just

Weand clear generalizations.  want to know all that constitutes the individuality,

so to speak, of every geographical district, and to define and illustrate it in a way
easily to be understood ; and we have to use that knowledge to show how the
elibrts of our human race may best conform to the geogTaphical conditions of the

stage on which we live and labour.

I trust it will not be thought unprofitable, on an occasion like this, to have

paused for a while, looking earnestly towards the future of our science, in order tn

refresh our eyes with a sight of the distant land to which we are bound, and to

satisfy ourselves that our present efforts lead in a right direction.

   The work immediately before us is full of details, and now claims your attention.
There is much to be done and discussed in this room, and I am chary of wasting

time by an address on general topics. It will be more profitable that I should lay

before you two projects of my own about certain maps, which it is desirable

that others than pure geogTaphers should consider, and on which I shall hope to

hear the opinions of my colleagues in the Committee-room of this Section.

They both refer to the Ordnance Maps of this country, and the first of them to

the complete series, well known to geographers, that are published on the scale of

one uich to a mile. It is on these alone that I am about to speak ; for though
many of my remarks will be applicable more or less to the other Government map

publications, I think it better not to allude to them in direct terms, to avoid dis-

tracting attention by qiialiffcations and exceptions.

English geographers are justly proud of these Ordnance Maps of their country,

whose accuracj' and hill-shading are unsurpassed elsewhere, though the maps do

not fulfil, in all particulars, our legitimate desires. I shall not speak here of the

absence from the coast-maps of the sea f?«/rt, such as the depth and character of the

bed of the sea, its currents and its tides (although these are determined and pub-

lished by another Department of the Government, namelj'the Admiralty), neither

shall I speak of the want of a more frequent revision of the sheets, but shall confine

myself to what appear to be serious, though easily remediable, defects in the form
and manner of their publication. It is much to be regretted that these beautiful

and cheap maps are not more accessible. They are rarely to be found even in the

principal booksellers' shops of important country towns, and I have never observed

one on the bookstall of a railway-station. Many educated persons seldom, if ever,

see them ;  they are  almost unknown to the middle and lower classes                                                                                                                                                                                      and thi;s  an
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

important work, made at the expense of the public, is practically unav.ailable to a

large majority of those interested in it, wlio, when tlu'y want a local map, are dri\ cu

to use a common and inferior one out of those whicli have the command of the

market. I am bound to add that this evil is not peculiar to our country', but is

felt almost as strongly abroad, especially in respect to the Government maps of
TRANSACTIONS OF THK SECTIONS.  201

France. I account for it by two principal reasons. The first is, that the maps are
always printed on stiff paper, which makes them cumbrous and untit for immediate
use: it requires large portfolios or drawers to keep them smooth, clean, and in separate
Sets, and an unusually large talile to lay them out side by side, to examine them
comfortably and to select what is wanted. These conditions do not exist on the
crowded counter of an ordinary bookseller's shop, where it is impossible to handle
them without risk of injury, and without the certainty of incommoding other
customers. Moreover, their stiffness and size, even when published in quarter
sheets, make them most inconvenient to the purchaser. Either he has to send
them to bo mounted in a substantial and therefore costly manner, or he must carry
a roll home with him, and cut oft" the broad ornamental borders and divide the

sheet into compartments suitable for the pocket, which, to say the least, is a

troublesome operation to perform with neatness. The other of the two reasons why

the maps are rarely offered for sale is that the agents for their publication are them-
selves map-makers, and therefore competitors, and it is not to be expected of human
nature that they should push the sale of maps adversely, in however small a degree,
to their own interests.

   The remedy I shall propose for the consideration of the Committee of this Section
is, to memorialize Government to cause an issue of the maps to be made in quarter
sheets on thin paper, and to be sold folded into a pocket size, like the county maps

seen at every railway-station, each having a portion of an index-map impressed on
its outside, to show its contents and those of the neighbouring sheets, as well as
their distinguishing numbers. Also I would ask that they should be sold at every

" Head Post-office " in the United Kingdom. There are about seven hundred of

these offices, and each might keep nine adjacent quarter sheets in stock, the one in

which it was situated being the centre of the nine. An index-map of the whole

survey might be procurable at each of these post-offices, and, by prepayment, any

map not kept in stock might be ordered at any one of them, and received in the

ordinary course of the post. This is no large undertaking that I have proposed.
The price of a quarter sheet in its present form, which is more costly than what I

ask for, used to be sold for only sixpence ; therefore the single complete set of nine
sheets for each office has a value of not more than four shillings and sixpence,

and for all the seven hundred Head Post-offices of not more than £1G0.
    I believe that these simple reforms would be an immense public boon, by enabling

any one to buy a beautiful and accurate pocket-map of the district in which he
resides for only sixpence, and without any trouble. They would certainly increase
the sale of Government maps to a great extent ; they would cause the sympathies

 of the people and of their representatives in Parliament to be enlisted on the side
 of the Survey, and they would probably be imitated by continental nations.

    It has often been objected to any attempt to increase the sale of Government
 maps, that the State ought not to interfere with private enterprise. I confess myself
 imable to see the applicability of that saj'ing. It would be an argument against
 making Ordnance Maps at all : but the nation has deliberately chosen to undertake
 that work, on the ground that no private enterprise could accomplish it satisfac-

 torily; and, having done so, I cannot understand why it should restrict the sale of
 its own work, in order to give a fictitious protection to certain individuals, against
 the interests of the public. It seems to me to be a backward step in political

 economy, and one that has resulted in our getting, not the beautiful maps for which
 we, as taxpayers, have paid, but copies or reductions of them, not cheaper than the
 original, and of very inferior workmanship and accuracy.

    So much for the first of the two projects which I propose to bring before the con-

 sideration of the Committee of this Section. It is convenient that I should preface

 my second one with a few remarks on colour-printing, its bearing on the so-caUed

 " bird's-ej'e views," and its recent application to cartography. Colour-printing is

 an art which has made groat advances in recent years, as may be seen by the

 specimens struck off in the presence of visitors to the present International Exhi-
 bition. One of these receives no less than twenty-four consecutive impressions,
 each of a diii'erent colour from a dillerent stone. This facility of multiplying
 coloured drawings will probably lead to a closer union than heretofore between

 geography and art. There is no reason now why " bird's-eye views " of large tracts
--202 REPORT 1872.

of country slioiild not be delicately drawn, accurately coloured, and cheaply j)ro-

Weduced.      all know what a geographical revelation is contained in a clear view

from a mountain top, and we also know that there was an immense demand for the

curiousty coarse bird's-eye views which were published during recent wars, because,

even such as they, are capable of furnishing a more pictorial idea of the geography

of a country tlian any map. It is therefore to be hoped that the art of designing

the so-called " bird's-eye views" may become studied, and that real artists should

engage in it. Such views of the environs of London would form \evj interesting

and, It might be, very artistic pictures.

   The advance of colour-printing has already influenced cartography in foreign
countries and it is right that it should do so, for a black and white map is but a

     --;

symbol it can never be a representation of the many-coloured aspects of Nature.

The Governments of Belgium, Russia, Austria, and many other countries have
already issued coloured maps; but none have made farther advance than the

Dutch, whose maps of Java are printed with apparently more than ten diflerent

colours, and succeed in giving a vivid idea of the state of cultivation in that

country.

I now beg to direct your attention to the following point. It is found that the

practice of printing maps in more than one colour has an incidental advantage of a
most welcome kind, namely, that it admits of an easy revision, even of the most
beautifully executed maps, for the following reason. The hill-work, in which the

delicacy of execution lies, is drawn on a separate plate, having perhaps been photo-

graphically reduced ; this has never to be touched, because the hills are permanent.
It is on another plate, which contains nothing else but the road-work, where the

coiTCctions have to be made ; and to do that is a very simple matter. I understand that

the Ordnance Survey Office has favourably considered the propriety of printing at

some future time an edition of the one-inch maps on this principle, and at least in

--two colours the one for the hills and the other for the roads.

  This being stated, I will now proceed to mention my second proposal.

   Recollecting what I have urged about the feasibility of largely increasing the
accessibility and the sale of Government maps, by publishing them in a pocket form

and selling them at the Head Post-offices, it seems to me a reasonable question for

the Committee of this Section to consider whether Government might not be

memorialized to consider the propriety of undertaking a reduced Ordnance Map of

the countiy, to serve as an accurate route-map and to fulfil the demand to which
the coarse county maps, which are so largely sold, are a sufficient testimony. The
scale of the reduced Government Map of France corresponds to what I have in

view ; it is one of 5 miles to an inch, within a trifle (-a^oV ot °f Nature), which is
just large enough to show every lane and footpath. Of course it would be a some-

what costly undertaking to make such a map, but much less so than it might, at

first sight, appear. Its area wordd be only one twenty-fifth that of the ordinary

Ordnance Map, and the hill-work of the latter might perhaps be photographically
reduced and rendered available at once. The desirability of maps such as these,

accurately executed and periodically revised, is imdoubted; while it seems impossible

that private enterprise should supply them except at a prohibitive cost, because

private publishers are necessarily saddled with tiie cost of re-obtaining much of

Awhat the Ordnance Survey Office has already in hand for existing purposes.

Government Department has unrivalled facilities for obtaining a knowledge of every

alteration in roads, paths, and boundaries of commons, and Government also

possesses an organized system in the post-offices fitted to vmdertake their sale.

The production of an accurate route-map seems a natiual corollary to that of the
larger Ordnance Maps, and has been considered to be so by many Continental

Governments.

   I therefore intend to propose to the Committee of this Section to consider the
propriety of memorializing Government to cause inquiries to be made as to the cost

of construction, and the probability of a remunerative sale, of maps such as those I

have described ; and, if the results are satisfactory, to undertake the construction
of a reduced Ordnance Map, on the same scale as that of France, to be printed in

colours and frequently revised.

  --These, then, are the two projects to which I alluded the one to secure the sale

-Head Post-offices of the United Kingdom, 700 or thereabouts in number, each office

keeping in stock the maps of the district in which it is situated ; and the other to

obtain a reduced Ordnance Map of the Idngdon:, on the scale of about 5 miles to an

inch, to fulfil all the purposes of a road-map, and to be sold throughout the country at

the post-offices, in the way I have just described.

  I will now conclude my address, having sufficiently taxed your patience, and beg
you to join with me in welcoming, with your best attention,' the eminent Geogra-

jphers whose communications are about to be submitted to your notice.

           The Euplirates-Valley Eoute to India. By "VV. P. Andrew.

 . In the opening portion of his paper the author dilated upon the many noble
objects which the proposed railway to India, via the Euphrates Valley, would

subserve. It would inevitably entail the colonization and civilizatian of the great
valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris, restore the old and renowned productiveness
of Mesopotamia, and resuscitate in modern shape Babylon, Nineveh, and Ctesiphon.

He argued that no direct route to India, amongst the many which had been pro-
posed, combined so many advantages as the ancient route of the Euphrates. It is

--the shortest and the cheapest, both for constructing and working a railway, so

free from engineering difficulties, that it appears as though designed by nature
for the highway of nations between the East and the West ; it is the most surely
defensible by England, both its termini being on the open sea, and the most likely
to prove remimerative. The other routes proposed, such as those from places on the
Black Sea, were open to the fatal objection that while they would be of the
greatest service to Russia, they would be beyond the control of Great Britain they

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

were besides excluded from practical consideration by the engineering difficulties

they involved. These conclusions had been demonstrated by many eminent wit-
nesses examined before the recent Select Committee of the House of Commons.
The author admitted the value of a continuous line from Constantinople to India, but
believed it to be too vast a project to be at present undertaken. The moderate
scheme which he advocated was a line 900 miles in length, from the Gulf of Scan-

deroon, via the rif/Jd bank of the Euphrates, to Kowait, in the north-western corner
of the Persian. Gulf. Should it be found desirable hereafter to construct a through
 line to India, this portion would form a ready-made and considerable section of it.
 It was precisely that portion of the route between Constantinople and India from
 which the greatest benefit would be derived by the substitution of railway for sea
transit, whether regard be had to the rate of speed or the economy with which the
 traffic might be worked. Both the proposed termini possess all the requisites of
 first-class harbours ; and the line, on leaving Alexandretta, would run to Aleppo, and

along the Euphrates, by way of Annah, Hit, Kerbela, Nedjef, Somowha, and Sheikh
el Shuyukh, to Kowait. The Euphrates would not be crossed, and the line would
have the strategic advantage of two great rivers being interposed between it and
an advancing^ enemy on the fiank on which there would be the greatest likelihood
of danger arising. The cost of the railway was estimated at £9,000,000 sterling.
The advantages of the proposed railway to England would be the possession of an

alternative route to India and the saving of nearly 1000 miles in linear distance.

                 On the Orography of the Chain of the Great Atlas.
                            By John Ball, F.R.S., F.L.S.

   The representations of the chain of the Great Atlas given on the most modern
maps show how very vague and incomplete our knowledge still is. Thev agree in
very little beyond the fact that high mountains extend in a nearly direct'line from
the west coast, where they approach the Atlantic, near Agadir, in about .'30° 30' N.
lat., for about GOO miles inland, where they subside at no great distance from the

frontier of Algeria about the parallel of ?m° 30'.

   All but the most recent maps indicate a single range similar in g-eneral character
204 KEPORT--1872.

to that of the Pyi-enees ; while in these we find represented two nearly parallel ranges

at an average distance of sixty or seventy miles, ot which the northeriiniast alone ter-

minates near the j^lgerian frontier, its axis lying exactly in the line of the great
shallow lakes or chotts that occupy a great part of the high plateau of southern

Algeria, while the southern range, with some slight interruption, is continuous
with the elevated zone that forms the northern limit of the Algerian Sahara. The

details, however, as given in these recent maps are strangely discordant, especially

in regard to the region lying E. and N.E. from the city of Morocco, and connecting
the main range with the mountains of North ^Morocco.

   It is not surprising that such discrepancies should exist, when it is known that

the best maps have been compiled with no better materials than the reports of

natives, and that none but a very small portion of the entire region has ever been

traversed by civilized men. In regard to Gerhard Rohlfs, one of the most remark-

able of recent African travellers, it must be remembered that he was forced to

maintain a rigid disguise, to associate constantly with natives, and to suit his move-

ments to theirs. He was unable to make more than scanty and occasional notes,

and was altogether debarred from the use of instruments. It is not surprising that,

iinder such conditions, his contributions to the topography of a region never before

visited by European traveller tend more to excite than to satisfy curiosity.

   During the spring of last year the Sultan of Morocco, at the request of the British

Minister, Sir John Drummond Hay, granted permission to Dr. Hooker, the eminent

Director of the Royal Gardens at Kew, to explore the portion of the Great Atlas

subject to the Imperial authority; and although the main object of the party, con-

sisting of Dr. Hooker, Mr. Maw, and myself, was to investigate the flora of the

mountains, it was not unreasonable to expect that we should be able to make some

considerable addition to existing geographical knowledge in regard to a region so

little known.

  Those who are best acquainted with Morocco will be least surprised to learn that

in this respect the expedition has not borne abundant fruit. The obstacles which

stood in the way were partly anticipated by us, but were in great measure

insuperable.

The authority of the Sultan extends over but a small portion of the region included

under the denomination Great Atlas ; it is, in fact, limited to the northern declivity

of the main chain, and only throughout the western part of this, for it extends to a

distance at the utmost not more than 120 miles E. of the city of Morocco. The

time at our disposal was too limited to enable us to explore even the limited field

that was thrown open to us. The cares and responsibilities attaching to his

official duties prevented Dr. Hooker from prolonging his stay in and near the

mountains beyond about three weeks, and the private engagements of Mr. Maw

compelled him to separate from us and to return to England at a still earlier date.
But by far the most serious obstacle which we encountered arose from the persistent

though covert opposition of all the persons holding local authority, aggrav<ated and

not seldom stimulated by the chief of our escort, whose charge, as we had been
assured, was to remove all impediments from our path.

But for the difficulties incessantly placed in our way, we should undoubtedly have

attained several of the higher peaks, and could not fail to have learnt a good deal

respecting the disposition of the greater masses and the direction of the main

ralleys in the territory which we could not actually traverse.

In point of fact we were able to make but two considerable ascents. On the first

occasion, when we ascended the Tagherot Pass in a storm of snow and hail that

completely intercepted all distant view, the cold was so severe that we willingly

turned our faces from the storm when only Mr. IMaw, the foremost of the party,

had actually' set his foot upon the summit, about 12,000 feet above the sea-level.

MawOn the second occasion, after I\Ir.  had left us, we attained a conspicuous

peak, called Djebel Tezah, about 11,500 feet in height, in a much lower part of

the range than that previously visited. In addition to the very limited results of

personal observation, we naturally availed ourselves of every promising opportunity

for obtaining topographical information from natives. Mucli of the information

obtained in this way appears to me utterly unreliable, especially when derived from

persons holding local authority j but the particulars supplied by a very intelligent

Jew residiug- iu Morocco, so far as tliey rest oa personal knowledge, dessrve more

 confidence.

   The following are the chief points as to which I think myself entitled to express

--an opinion, premising that as to some of them I may place undue confidence in my

own personal conclusions :

    1. The portion of the Atlas chain that is seen from the city of Morocco is con-
siderably higher than has generally been supposed. The chief summits appear to
be nearly ot the same height, and the majority of these approach very nearly, if
they do not occasionally surpass, the level of 14,000 feet. Westward of the district

of Cxlaoui, S. W. of the city of Morocco, the range subsides gi-adually as it approaches

the coast.

   2. There is a certain amount of tolerable evidence tending to show that the

interior part of the range extending from the upper valley of the Wed Tessaout to

the frontier of Morocco contains peaks of higher elevation than any seen by us.
   3. The existence of an anti-Atlas or range parallel to the main chain, and

enclosing on the south side the great valley of the Sous, was established by Rohlfs,

if not by previous travellers ; but we are probably the first who have looked across
the wide intervening space and scanned the outline of the anti-Atlas. The portion

seen by us at a distance of from 50 to GO miles is far less bold in form than the
main range. The utmost height of that portion can scarcely exceed 10,000 feet.

   4. The map compiled by Capt. Beaudouin, and published in Paris at the D^pot
Geni5ral de la Guerre in 1848, which is decidedly the best that has hitherto
appaared, is defective in representing the main chain as arising abruptly from the
low country, scarcely indicating considerable lateral valleys. At the sanie time it

should be remarked that the projecting ridges which divide these lateral valleys
appear to be lower, in comparison with the peaks of the main chain, tlian is usual in

other great mountain-ranges.

   5. There is a marked tendency to the formation of considerable valleys parallel to
the main chain, and in such cases the remark made in the last paragraph does not
apply. Some of the higher peaks, and amongst them that named Miltsin by the
late Captain Washington, lie in ridges nearly parallel to the main chain.

   6. It appears at least possible that the anti-Atlas, if we may so denominate tho

range forming the southern boundary of the Sous valley, is merely an example on

a large scale of one of the parallel ridges just referred to, many examples of which
are to be found in better known mountain-regions.

   7. The existence of two parallel chains so continuous as those represented in
Gerhard Rohlfs's map appears 'to be open to reasonable doubt. In the absence of

direct evidence, it appears at least equally probable that the conformation of the

main chain may be best represented by a series of ridges slightly inclined to the

axis of elevation of the entire mass.

   8. The remarkable valley of the Benimguald, laid down on Beaudouin's map as
extending more than one hundred miles from S.E. to N.W. in a nearly direct line,

must be pronounced imaginary or based on false information. Tlie details "iven in
llohlfs's ' Ileise durch Marokko,' however incomplete, are manifestly inconsistent
with the general plan of the mountain-system laid down in that map.

On tlie OeograpMcal Distribution of Forests in India. Bi/ Dr. Brandis.

In all countries the character of forest vegetation mainly depends on soil, climate,

and the action of man. In India the greater or less degree of moisture is perhaps

tlie most important element in this respect. Moisture and rainfall are not identical

terms. In many parts of India and elsewhere dew and the aqueous vapour

dissolved iu the atmosphere, or the water derived from the overflow of rivers and

from percolation, are sources of moisture as important for the maintenance of arbo-

rescent vegetation as the fall of rain and snow. It would greatly facilitate the

labours of the forester and of the botanist, who inquire after the geograpliical distri-

bution of forest-trees, if the amount of atmospheric moisture and the formation

of dew during the seasons of the year in different p arts of India had been sufficiently

studied ; but in the present state of our knowledge we must be satisfied with dividino-

India into regions and zones according to the more or less heavy rainfall during the
year. The arid region, with an annual rainfall of less than fifteen inches, occupies
a large portion of the north-west corner of India, from the Salt range in the north
to the mouths of the Indus in the south, and from the Suleiman range in the
west to the Aravulli Hills in the east. It includes the southern portion of the
Pun j ah, the province of. Sindh, the States of Bhawulpoor, KhjTpoor, Bikanir,
Jessulmir, and the greater part of Marwar. Throughout this vast region, which
covers an area equal to that of the kingdom of Prussia, with a population of from
twelve to fifteen millions, the rains are not only scanty but most uncertain. It is
not a rare occurrence for several years to pass in succession without any showers,
and then there is a heavy downpour, generally in winter, and occasionally in
August or September. There are, however, no regular winter or sximmer rains.

A scanty, thorny scrub on the hills and in the northern part in the plains also

gives ample emplojonent to the botanist, for it is here that the representatives of
the Arabian and Persian flora mingle with the vegetation which is peculiar to
India; but the work of the forester is mainly confined to the belts of low country
along the Indus and its great branches. In Sindh, for instance, the area of forest
land which is under the exclusive control of the State covers 350,000 acres, all
situated on the fertile alluvial soil on both banks of the Indus, some of which is
inundated annually by the summer floods of this large river, the remainder being
moistened by percolation. In lower and middle Sindh a large portion of these
forests consists of Acacia arahica, more or less pure, with a shade so dense that
very little grass or herb gTOWS imder the trees. In northern Sindh extensive shrub-
forests of tamarisk, with standards of Acacia and Pojndus eiiphratica, cover large

tracts along the banks on both sides of the river. As the Indus changes its course

from time to time, leaving dry last year's bed and breaking through at another

place, forming a new channel, the fresh banks and islands which are thus tlirown
up are covered at once by a dense growth of self-sown seedlings of tamarisk, with

a sprinkling here and there of the acacia and poplar; and in other places large
tracts of old forests are earned away by the encroachments of the river. Outside
these forests a little further inland, but still to a certain extent under the moisten-
ing influence of the river, are vast tracts of Prosopis spicigera, Sulvaclora, and Capi-
piaris aphrjlla, and further north, in the Punjab, where the rainfall is more regular
and its annual amount approaches or exceeds ten inches, these dry woodlands,
mainly composed of Prosopiis, Ca2>paris, and Salvadora, cover a vast extent of
country between the rivers of that province. These woodlands are commonly

known imder the name of Rukhs, and they extend far into the second zone, which
the author proposes calling the dry region of India, and in which the normal rain-
fall is between fifteen and thirty inches. There are two zones of dry coimtry : one
running on the north and east of the arid region in a belt from one hundred to two
hundred and fifty miles wide, leaving tlie foot of the Himalaya range about Umballa,

touching the Ganges at Futtehgurh, and including Agra, Jhansi, Ajmere, and
Deesa. This he proposed calling the northern ry zone : its natural forest vege-
tation is scanty, but better than that of the arid region. In some of the States of
Eajpootana there are extensive woodlands of Acacia arahica, Prosopis, and a species
 of Anogeissus, carefully preserved, to fm-nish cover for game, a regular supply of
wood and grass, and, in times of drought, pasture for the cattle of the vicinity
and in some parts of the Aravulli Hills, where cultivation mainly depends on the
water stored up in tanks, the value of preserving the scanty thorny scrub on the
hills, in order to regulate the filling of the tanks from rain, is recognized by the larger

landholders. Nor must we forget that we owe the maintenance of the forests in

Sindh and of the rukhs in the Punjab to the action taken by the former rulers,
and that during the first period after the occupation of the country the action of
the British Government has not in all cases been favourable to the preservation
of the forests and woodlands in the arid and dry regions of India. Great exertions
have, however, been made of late years to make up in some measure for past
neglect in tliis respect ; and in the Punjab extensive plantations have been esta-

blished since 18G5, which now cover upwards of 12,000 acres, the main object in
the formation of these new forests being to provide fuel for the consumption of the

railways, and fuel and timber for the large towns in that province. There is a,

second dry region in the peninsula of India, comprising part of the Deccan, the

Maidan or open country of Mysore, and several distiicts of the Madras Presidency.

There are exceptionally moi.*t places^within its limits, such as Bangalore, whicli,

being situated 3000 feet above the sea, has somewhat more than thirty inches rain

but upon the whole, and excluding hills, which rise considerably above the table-

land of South India, this belt, which stretches from Nassick in the north to Cape

Comorin in the south, has a normal rainfall of less than thirty inches. This belt

includes Poona, Bellary, and Kurnool in the north, and Madura and Tinuevelh' in

the south. Over a great part of it is found the sandal-wood (Sa7ifali(in alhinn), a

small tree with fragrant heart wood, which comes up here and there in bushes and

hedges, but does not gi-ow gregariously and does not form pure forests. The moist

tracts of country, with a normal rainfall exceeding seventy-five inches, are two.

One is a nan-ow belt on the western coast, extending from Bombay in the north to

Trevandrum in |the south, and comprising the whole country below Ghat, and a

narrow strip above Ghat, the latter varying in width at different places, but often

only a few miles wide, although the fall on the crest of the Ghats is in places as

heavj' as 250 inches. The other moist region is much larger ; it comprises the outer
hills of the Himalaya range from Kangra to Assam, gradually increasing in width

from a narrow belt twenty to thirty miles wide in the north-west Himalaya, and

includes the whole of Eastern Bengal and Burma. The vegetation within these

two tracts of moist country is exceedingly luxuriant and varied. The teak-forests

{Tectona ffrandis) of Burma, Canara, the W^Tiaad and the Anamallays, the ever-

green forests of Burma, Eastern Bengal and the western Ghats, and the extremely

vaiied forest vegetation of the outer Himalayan ranges belong to this region. The

greater part of Central and a large portion of Northern India belongs to what may

be called the intermediate region, with a rainfall between thirty and seventy-five

inches. The extensive sal-forests (Shorea rohtista) of the sub-Himalayan tract and

of Central India are found in the moister parts of this region. Where the rainfall

exceeds forty inches, forest vegetation is fairly luxuriant ; but the gTeat drawback

in this, as in most parts of India, is the circumstance that the rainfall is not equally

distributed over the year, but limited to the rainy season, which ^·aries in length

from two to six months. The year thus, in most parts of India, divides itself into

two seasons, the dry season and the rainy ; and the dry season is generally the

longer of the two. Dews and rare showers keep the grass and leases in the forest

fairly moist  until  January  or  February                                                                                                                        after  that  time they dry          up  rapidly,  and by
                                                                                       ;

March and April every thing is so dry that the smallest spark is sufficient to set it

on fire. Hence the jungle-tires are an annually occurring institution in a great

part of the country, and they do much to keep back forest vegetation. Successful

attempts have, however, been made within the last six years to keep out fires in

some of the more valuable forests, and the effect on the growth of the forest has

been marvellous. In the Himalaya range moisture gradually decreases as we pro-

ceed inland, until a country is reached almost without rainfall, and with very little

spontaneous arborescent vegetation. In the intermediate country, with a moderate

supply of moisture, is the greater part of the Deodar forests ( Cedrvs Deodara),
which furnish the north-west of India with timber. Here, as elsewhere, the

influence of moisture on the rate of growth is remarkable. In the outer ranges,

with a rainfall of sixty to eighty inches, the Deodar attains a diameter of two feet

in from sixty to eighty years                                                                                                                                     further inland, in the dry region,  at the same eleva-

Lomond, from observations made by him with a Miller-Casalla tharmometer,

three important facts were stated :

   1. On the 12tli of October, 1871, the temperature at the surface was 52', from

which it fell, on descending, till at 300 feet below the surface it stood at 42^;
and this temperature of 42^ was uniformly maintained at greater depths, or o
518 feet, the depth of tlie loch at the place of observation.

   2. On the 18th of November following, the surface-temperature was 46' ; at a

depth of 250 feet 42°-25 ; at 270 feet and lower depths 42°.

   3. On the 10th of April, 1872, the temperature at the surface was 43°, at 150

feet 42°- 1, and from 200 to 594 feet 42°.

  --Hence it appears that there is a stratum of water of considerable thickness at the

bottom of this loch of uniform temperature that the upper surface of this stratum
of deep water of uniform temperature was about 100 feet higher on the 10th of

--April than it was in the beginning of winter, or on the 18th of November and

that this deep-water temperature probably remains constantly at or very near 42°.
   During this period the temperature was the average of the season on fifty-one

days, the deficiency amounting to a mean of 3°-4 and above the average on ninety-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

four days, the excess amounting to a mean of 4^, the most markedly mild periods

extending over sixty-nine days, viz. from the lltli of January to the 10th of March,
during which the temperature was on an average 3°-9 above that of the season
and the temperature was, for the whole period of 145 days, l°-4 above the average.

   It may be concluded that in ordinary winters the stratum of water of uniform

temperature will be thicker than Sir Robert Christison found it to be this year
in the beginning of spring ; in other words, that it will be nearer the surface than
170 feet.

   The late Mr. James Jardine, C.E., made observations on the temperature of
Lochs Tay, Katrine, and Lomond, in August and September 1812, and again in
September 1814, and found the deep-water uniform temperature of the lochs to
be 41°-9, 41°-7, and 41°-5,

   These observations were made in the summer and early autumn, or when the
temperature of the sea and of the lakes is about the annual maximum. Taken

in connexion with Sir Robert Christison's observation, they warrant the conclusion

that the deep-water temperature of Loch Lomond remains during the whole year

either absolutely at, or very nearly at, the low figure of 42°.
   Mr. Jardine's observations also show that this is not a peculiarity of Loch

Lomond, but that it is also a characteristic of Lochs Katrine and Tay, and most

probably of other deep waters.

   The mean annual temperature of the air at Loch Lomond, from the mean at

Balloch Castle, situated at the foot of the loch, calculated on tlie thirteen years'
average ending 1869, is 48°, which is 6° higher than the uniform deep-water

temperature of the loch. The deep-water temperature is, therefore, not deter-
mined by the mean annual temperature of air over this part of the earth's surface.

   From Forbes's ' Climate of Edinburgh,' it is seen that the temperature there is
under the annual mean from the 21st of October to the 26th of April. Assuming
that this holds good for Balloch Castle, then the mean temperature of the air for

these 188 days is 41°-4.

   The close approximation of this temperature of 41°-4 to 42°, the deep-water
temperature of the loch, is such as to suggest that it is the mean temperature of the

cold half of the year which determines the temjyerature of the lowest stratum of water
at the bottom of deep lakes, so long a? the deep-water temperature does not fall

below that of the maximum density of the water. As this principle, if established,
would be of great importance in many questions of physical research, such as the

deep-water temperature of the Mediterranean Sea, which Dr. Carpenter has \ery
accurately ascertained, in its connexion with the larger question of general oceanic

circulation, it well deserves further investigation.

the direction of the Bubj'i river, a granitic country -was entered, which continued
to the furthest point reached, Matiba. The Bubyi has no running- water in the dry
season, but its banlis are clothed wiih groves of a fan-leaved palm and a line Mimosa,
some of the latter trees forty feet high without a branch. The granitic fojmation
of this region possesses very remarkable features ; vast Hats stretch away for a
distance of sixty miles, studded with granite hills, each formed of a single mass of
rock rising to a height of COO to 1000 feet ; the rock is denuded for miles, and the
country a waterless desert. The natives build their huts under the shelter of large
scales of granite on the sides of the hills and also on the bare rounded summits.

No European could reach these places, but the inhabitants scale the hills with the

facility of baboons. The author stated that there was very little hope of the
Limpopo ever being rendered a navigable river, or the country settled by a European
population. Lydenburg, further south, is situated in a line agricultural district
and the country to the eastward, on the slopes of the Quathlamba, is very beau-
tiful and fertile for a distance of 100 miles. In 1870 he discovered gold in a

mountain-range south-west of Lydenburg.

   On a TJiroug7i BaUway Route to India, via Russia and the Oxus Valley.
                              By Geyf Jaxa de Bykowski.

   The author had traversed the route he recommended, travelling on horseback a

distance of 2000 miles. He estimated the length of the line at 1900 miles,
whereas the route from England, via the Euphrates valley, was 318-5 miles. From
the Volga to the Hindoo Koosh extended a plain, traversable even now by wheeled

carriages. Crossing the Hindoo Koosh from Inderab to Planshir valley, there
were only a few miles of mountain. It is true there were narrow gorges along the
Cabul river, which would entail expensive works, but they were quite practicable.

  On Dr. Livhigstone's Recent Discoveries. By Lieut.-Colonel J. A. Grant.

  The author observed that it was much to be regretted that Dr. Livingstone's

despatches and letters contained so few observations of latitude, longitude, and
altitude, and that map-makers were consequently unable to lay down his A'ast dis-
coveries with any degree of certainty. Dr. Livingstone had informed us that his
gi-eat line of drainage had been traced by him from 12" S. lat. down to 4° S. lat.,
and that he believed the waters continued to flow beyond that until they joined
the Bahr el Gazal, a western tributary of the Nile. But no such thing could happen.
The Bahr el Gazal throughout its course was a system of marshes, stagnant waters
overgro-mi with rushes and ambadj, and supplied very little water to the Nile.
Moreover, Dr. Schweinfurth, a recent German traveller, of whose discoveries Living-
stone, of course, could not be aware, had discovered the sources of the rivers of the

Bahr el Gazal system in from 3° to 5° N. lat. From the facts recorded by Living-

stone that pigs were kept by the natives of the Lualaba countr}', and that the gorilla
was found there (both of which animals are imknown in the Nile Lake-region),
the author concluded that the great traveller had underestimated the westing he
had made in his longitude, and that he was really on the upper waters of the
Congo, which flowed west into the Atlantic.

           Tlie Place of Oeoyraphy, Political and Physical, in Education.

                           By the Eev. Edavakd Hale, M.A.

   Every one is brought into contact with man and nature. The first aim of edu-
cation should be to teach the duties we owe to man, our social duties, and to teach
the advantages we may derive from a proper knowledge and application of the
powers of nature. The social duties have been taught by means of philosophy and
history. To learn these, the fathers of philosophy and historj^ had to be studied
in their own language. Hence arose the system of classical education, which at

last degenerated into the mere teaching of Greek and Latin, or rather of Greek

and Latin grammar, and this, too, not in a scientific manner.
210 REPORT--1873.

  But the study of nature has been practically ignored in education. Human

philosophy has been taught, but not natural philosophy. Of late years there has
been an attempted teaching of science in some schools, but it has been superficial.
All school education should be thorough ; but as boys and girls cannot learn much,
what they are taught must be thoroughly taught, and must of necessity be rudi-

mentary.

   Education naturally divides itself into two branches, a human and natural phi-

--losophy tlie one taught by literature and history, the other by mathematics and

science. Those subjects, then, should be taught which are absolutely essential as

introductory to both branches. These should be a language, ancient and modern,

arithmetic, geometrical drawing, and geography. Political geography is the proper

introduction to the study of history, as physical geograph}' is to that of nature.

Geography can be taught thoroughly, even when compulsOrily taught, and can be

made attractive both to j)upil and teacher ; whereas it is extremely difficult to teach

chemistry or astronomy (for instance) compulsorily, and impossible to do more

than teach them superficially. The method of teaching phj'sical geography at

Eton, not assumed to be the best method, is simply this : to teach by means of

lectures, to use no text-book, to illustrate freely, to require constant reproduction

of the lectm-e by the pupil in his own words, and to examine the pupils constantly

by papers. One advantage of the method of employing no text-book is that it

prevents " cram." Geography is, however, iu itself a study which, provided the
knowledge of the pupil is properly tested, admits of less " cramming " than any

other study, partly from its great range, and partly from its admitting of so many

problems being given.      _^^___^

       Recent Clianges of Level in Land and Sea. By H. H. Howokth.

The Direct Highway to India considered. By Capt. Felix Jones,

This paper advocated the construction of a railway to unite the Mediter-

routes through Asia Minor, Northern Persia, or via Diai'bekr and the left bank of

the way of a line of railroad. Aleppo is the key to the entire system of railways

Aiu Turkey.  proposed line hence to Mosul would have the advantage of absorb-

ing all the lines of traffic from the north and east ; but in its continuation along

the Tigris it would entail the bridging of the Euphrates tv^nce and the Tigris once,

besides being 300 miles longer than the route along the east bank of the Euphrates.

The author spoke also of the more settled habits of the Arab population along this

latter route, and of the manifest strategic and political value to England of this

line and its two termini.

           On the Relation of Forests to Hydrology. By G. Lemoine.

   The result at which the author had arrived in the investigations on which he
had been officiallj' engaged in France was, that the action of forests on the climate
of a country must be considered as extremely doubtful. In the basin of the Seine
it had been established that forests had no special influence on the supply of water
in streams, as compared with similar areas of ground clothed with grass. Tlie
only absolutely certain action of forests was their influence on the protection of
the soil, i. e. they prevented it being carried away by rains. In consequence of
this action, they retarded, in mountainous countries, the flow of torrents ; and this
result had been well ascertained iu the Department of the Hautes Alpes, where
the replanting of woods had extinguished torrents abeady formed ; but in most
cases turfing alone had been found to produce an equal eflect. These conclusions,

in the opinion of the. author, ought to he carefully limited to the countries in
            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                      211

which the subject had been investigated. They showed the extent of man's

powers in influencing climate. He could so far modify the surface as to extinguish

torrents ; but the great general phenomena of the atmosphere, and the cxu'reuts of

air which determine the climate of a country, are beyond his reach.

            Extracts from the Official Despatches of Dr. Livinr/sione.

The geographical information communicated in these despatches is contained

chiefly in that to Lord Clarendon, dated the Ist of November, 1871. In this

letter Dr. Livingstone states that he had ascertained that the watershed of the

Nile was a broad upland between 10^ and 12^ S. lat., and lying from 4000 to 5000

feet above the sea-level. It is 703 miles in length from east and west, and from

it flow innumerable streams, which further north unite to form two main lines of

--drainage large " lacustrine " rivers, the exploration of one of which, called the

central line, had occupied all the traveller's time and means down to the date of

--his despatch. The geographical results are stated to be chiefly as follow : " The

great river, Webb's Lualaba, in the centre of the Nile valley, makes a great bend

to the west, soon after leaving Lake Moero, of at least 180 miles ; then, turning to

the north for some distance, it makes another large sweep west of about 120 miles,

in the course of which about 30  miles of southing are  made                          it then  draws round
                                                                                   ;

to north-east, receives the Lomame, or Loeki, a large river which flows tlirough

Lake Lincoln. After the union, a large lake is formed, with many inhabited islands

in it ; but this has still to be explored. It is the fourth large lake in the central

line of drainage, and cannot be Lake Albert ; for assuming Speke's longitude of

Ujiji to be pretty correct, and my reckoning not enormously wrong, the great cen-

tral lacustrine river is about five degrees west of Upper and Lower Tanganyika. The
mean of many barometric and boiling-point observations made Upper Tanganyika

2880 feet high ; . . . but I have more confidence in the barometers than in the
boiling-points, and they make Tanganyika over 3000 feet, and the lower part of

the Central Lualaba 1 inch lower, or about the altitude ascribed to Gondokoro

[nearly 2000 feet]." The furthest point he reached to the north was stated to be

lat. 4° S.

        On Polar Exphratlon. By Capt. Sheeaed Osboen, C.B., E.N.

   The author wished to draw the attention of the Association to Polar discovery,
and to ask for sympathy and support in the efforts made by the Royal Geographi-
cal Society, in combination with other learned bodies, to bring about a renewal of
Arctic discovery by British seamen and explorers. Since the return of Sir Leopold
M'Clintock, in "September 1859, from his memorable voyage in the 'Fox,' and foot
journey round King William's Land, no British exploring-expedition had passed
within the limits of the Arctic zone, and it appeared as if English geographical
enterprise in the North had for a while become exhausted by the exertions made
to rescue or learn the fate of Franklin's expedition. These exertions, which com-
menced in 1848 and ended in 1859, yielded a rich harvest of geographical explo-
ration, as a comparison of the Admiralty charts would plainly show. From Baffin's
Bay to Behring's Straits, through 90° of longitude and 8° of latitude, the whole
Dwrthern shores of the American continent and the great archipelago to the north
was not only explored, but almost every foot of coast-line was searched .by ship,
boat, or sledge parties. This great task was accomplished by much self-sacrifice,
much labour, and considerable sufiering, but without any casualties of a serious
character. But thougii British Arctic enterprise rested from 1859, it was not so
with other countries. The seamen and geographers of America (with that dogged

trated than in the recent heroic journey of Mr. Stanley to the rescue of Livingstone)

were not satisfied even by the news brought home by Rae and M'Clintock of the
glorious fate of Franklin, with M'Clure's accomplishment by ship and sledge of a

passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, or with Dr. Kane's report of a

passage, with much open water, extending northward through Smith's Sound ; but

--they immediately sent forth, by private enterprise supplemented with Government

aid,' two fresh expeditions one, under Captain Hall, to try on foot to reach Eepulse
Bay and the estuary of the Great Fish River, with the object of trying to save any
 documents left by the last survivors of Franklin's people ; and the other to add, if
possible, fresh geographical discoveries in the promising field of Smith's Sound laid
 open by the gallant l)r. Kane. Captain Hall for seven years lived the life of an
Esquimaiix and returned to tell us of a vast amount of relics of the crews of the
 ' Erebus ' and ' Terror ' being strewed about the shores and islets south of King
William's Land, to bring home the bones of probably the latest survivor. Lieu-
tenant le Vescomte, but only to confirm Sir Leopold M'Clintock's opinion, that by
 some sad fatality no written record beyond the one he picked up at Cape Victory
 existed of that lost expedition. Yet the ardour of Captain Hall was so little
 quenched by these long years of hardship that he again volunteered for Arctic

--labours, and was again now striving with a fresh-appointed expedition to secure to

his country the honour of a polar exploration Dr. ILiy, who had been sent out on
 Kane's footsteps, having in the mean time returned, a'fter carrying up the investi-

 gation of the shores of Grinnel Land, on the west side of Smith's Sound, to the

 80th parallel of latitude, only COO miles from the Pole, with much open water in
 sight. While our Transatlantic brethren had thus unfiinchingly persevered iu
 Arctic research other European nations had not been idle. Sweden had since 18C0

 sent scientific expedition after expedition to Spitzbergen, not only to explore that
 region, but also to test a theory of an open sea extending bej'ond it, by which the

--navigator could reach and explore the Polar area that great unknown space, of

 more than a million square miles, lying around the polo and within the 80th
  parallel of latitude. Captain von Oiler and Professor Nordenskiiild, after repeated
  gallant eflbrts, reported no probability of reaching it in that direction. Germany,
  for ten years, under the inspiration of Dr. Petermann, of Gotha, had been attempt-
  ing unsuccessfully to reach these Polar waters by passing either between Spitz-
  bergen and Nova Zembla, or between Spitzbergen and Greenland ; and after en-
  countering all the ordinary perils of the Arctic voyage, and exhibiting indomitable
  courage and perseverance, the German leader, Captain Karle Koldeway, returned
  to tell us in 1871 what Parry, Eoss, and Franklin had told us half a century ago,
  that the outpour of ice between Greenland and Spitzbergen was too continuous
  and heavy for any navigator to push through, and that on the east of Spitzbergen
  an open passage to the Pole was a mere philosophical dream. Yet that latter
  course might still be a subject for geographical dispute had not two gallant
  officers of the Austrian Navy boldly essayed it from Tromso, in Norway, last year.
  The results of that enterprising little voj'age had been so recently laidby Captain
  Osborn before the Royal Geographical Society that it was unnecessary to repeat it
  here; but one thing was certain, that as they went northward, and reached about
  the 7yih parallel of latitude, to the east of Spitzbergen, they were fast approaching
  some unknown land of which glimpses had only previously been obtained. This
  land must block the passage in that direction, its existence accounting for the
  absence of drift Polar ice between Nova Zembla and the North Cape of Europe.
  These same Austrian explorers had again put forth with the intention of explwing

 --the sea in a north-east direction from Nova Zembla along the shores of Siberia to

   Behring's Straits a course likely to yield rich scientific and geographical results

  and we could only wish them the " God-speed " they deserved at our hands. All

  these efforts by European nations, barring ourselves, during the last ten years,

  went to confirm the theory held now by nearly all our Arctic navigators, that the
  best, the safest, and most promising route towards the unknown Pole of our earth
  lay by way of Baffin's Bay and Smith's Sound ; and by that route the President

   and Council of the Royal Geographical Society desired to see English navigators,

  associated with competent men of science, make a strenuous eflbrt next year to

lovers of science, or those to whom the honour of our country and the good of its

naval profession were dear, to the " Memorandum on the Resumption of Polar

Discovery," issued by the President, Sir Henry Rawlinson. The harvest which a

properly appointed expedition would reap from a scientific point of view was incal-

culable, with our present knowledge of how well and safely to navigate and explore

the Polar regions, as was proved by the success of all the English Arctic ]&cpe-

ditions from 1849 to 1859. The Government and the Admiralty had recently

shown some desire, during a long period of peace, to promote, through naval expe-

ditions, the cause of science ; and he hailed, in the equipment of Her Majesty's ship

' Challenger,' under Captain Nares, associated with Professor Wyville Thomson,

a return to that wise policy of our forefathers, which had added so much since the

days of Cook, Banks, and Solander to the sum of human knowledge and the glory

of our country ; and he felt sure that an earnest representation by the associated

scientific bodies of Great Britain, as represented by the British Association, would

ensure the despatch of two small vessels, properly equipped, in 1873 to Smith's

Sound, thence to return to us in a couple of years, bringing back a mass of infor-

mation on all those questions of physical science which l)r. Hooker recently so

eloquently pointed out could only be solved by a scientific exploration in the direc-

tion recommended by the Royal Geographical Society.

       On the Physical Features of the Pamir and its Aryan Inhahitants.

                                    By E. B. Shaw.

  The author gave as the results of his own observations and inquiries, and those
of the late Mr. Hayward and recent Russian travellers, that the lofty Pamir Steppe

was not a continuous open plateau, supported by a meridional range of mountains
called the Bolor, but that it was composed of a series of parallel ridges running
east and west, united by high plateaux studded with lakes, from which issued
streams, some flowing eastward and others westward. The traditions of two great
branches of the Aryan race pointed to this region as their birth-place. At the
present time the beautiful valleys west of the Pamir are inhabited by a race totally
different from the Tartar population both in appearance and in language, and
claiming kindred with the Persian-speaking Tajiks of Bokhara. They are of fair
complexion, often witli light hair and hazel eyes, and their features are refined
and handsome. Judging by the scanty vocabularies obtained by the author, their
dialects, although indicating a close affinity with Persian, yet possc-^s many roots
which more nearly approach to Sanscrit forms, suggesting the idea of a link between
these two Aryan modes of speech.

Discoveries at the Northern End of Lai-e Tanganyil-a.
                       i?v/ H. M. Staklet.

Mr. Stanley prefaced the reading of his paper by an account of the origin of his

project of searching for Dr. Livingstone, and of his journey to Ujiji and his

meeting with the great traveller, an account similar to that'which'has already

been made known to the public. He commenced his account of Tanganyika by

stating that he was enabled to fill up the south-eastern shores of the lake (at

present a blank on our maps) with rivers, marshes, and jnountain-ranges, and

people them with powerful tribes. From Unyanyembe he passed through Southern

Wavinza, Ubba (three marches), the beautiful country of Ukaranga, and then

crossed the Linche valley to the neighbourhood of Tjiji. At the time of his pro-

posing to Dr. Livingstone a journej^, in company, to the northern end of the lake,

the Doctor was almost sure that the Albert Nyanza and Tanganyika communicated
with each other. He had perceived, as he thought, a constant flow northward in

the waters of  Tanganyika                                                           and all                                                                                                  the Arabs  and  negroes  persisted  in  declaring

ment of this question, lie lost no time in preparing for the journey. Previously,

as lie stated, lie had not regarded the subject as of any importance, the central line

of drainage (;'. e. the Lualaba) having absorbed all his time and means. Embarkino-

in a boat, and travelling northwards from Ujiji, the two travellers hugged the

coast of Ujiji and Urundi, looking sharply into every little inlet and creek for the

outlet that was said to be somewhere. About fifteen to twenty miles were travelled

per diem, past lofty mountains, rising sometimes 2000 or 3000 feet above the level of

the lake, and camping ashore for the night. Several times they were in danger from

the natives, and their men had to keep watch all night, lest they should be sur-

prised while asleep. It took ten davs to reach the head of the lake on the oppo-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

site shore a mountain-range, ever bold and high, limited tlieir western view and

appeared impenetrable. The lake is of very great depth : Mr. Stanley sounded two

miles from  shore  and found no bottom with 620 feet  of  line                  and Dr.  Livingstone
                                                                             ;

fm'ther south, while crossing, found no bottom with 1800 feet of line. The moun-

tains round the northern end fold around so close, with no avenue for the escape

of waters, save the narrow valleys and ravines by whicli tributary streams reach

the lake, that were the waters to rise 500 feet above their present level, the cou-

iiguration of the lake would not be materially altered. The evening before they

saw the Rusizi, a freedman of Zanzibar declared (in answer to their questions)

that he had been on the river the day before, and that it ran out of the lake. This

information caused the two travellers to deliberate on their farther proceediugs,

sliould they find a channel leading into Albert Nyanza ; and they decided they
would in that case follow it and coast round its shores, in the liope of meeting with

Sir Samuel Baker. The mouth of the river was at length found ; it was in a

little bay about a mile in width, and was masked by a dense brake of papyrus and

matete cane. The entrance was not visible, and they followed some canoes which

were disappearing mysteriously through gaps in the brake. Thus they found the

central mouth, and all doubt as to whether it was an effluent or an influent soon

vanished, for a strong brown flood met them, which tasked all their exertions to

pull against. Higher up it widens into lagoons on either side. The alluvial plain

through which the tlusizi flows into the lake is about twelve miles wide at the

commencement, and fifteen miles in length, narrowing upwards to a point. The

mountain-ranges on either side here approximate to within two miles, the eastern

range passiug the termination of the western. Further towards the north-west

there was a perfect jumble of mountains. The chief Rubinga (near theRusizi), who

was a great traveller and readily discussed questions of geography with the two

explorers, told them that the Rusizi rose in Lake Kivo, a sheet of water fifteen

miles long by about eight broad, from which it escaped by a gap in the mouut.ains.

About twenty miles from its mouth the Rusizi is joined by the Luanda, or Ruanda,

flowing from the north-west; and there were besides seventeen other tributary

streams. Rubinga had been six days to the northward, but had not heard of a

large body of water, such as Lake Albert Nyanza. Baker's lake, therefore, could

not have the large extension southward which its discoverer had claimed for it.

On their return journey to Ujiji, they coasted along the western shore of Tan-

ganyika, visiting Uvira, where they were shown the sandy beach on which the
Acanoes of Burton and Speke had rested.
                                               little south of this rises the lofty peak

of Sumburizi, 4500 feet above the lake-level.

Dr. Livingstone ha-ving sent home no map of his discoveries, or any material

from which one could be constructed, beyond the descriptions in his despatches,

Mr. Stanley, at the request of the President, pointed out, on a map of Africa, the

position of the rivers and lakes, as near as he could recollect; from the map he had

examined while in Dr. Livingstone's company.

 On the Scope of Scientific Oeocfraphy, illustrated hy Bemarls on tJie Climate

preliensive than other sciences in its scope, "was to be cultivated, like th em, by

scientific method. It had for its foundation an exact description and delineation

of the relative positions and characteristics of the various features of every region

of the earth, which have then to be viewed in relation to the multitude of co-

existing phenomena constituting the characters of the several regions, so that the

laws of their mutual dependence may be finally deduced. This was usually called

" Physical Geography ;" but the author believed it more correctly to be the

science of Geography. Each region had its special features of configuration,

climate, and inhabitants, and the inquiry into the causes of these led us into a

field which was almost conterminous with the entire circle of human knowledge.

Such afield might seem too vast for individual powers, but it did not require

especial devotion to the details of each branch of knowledge, but only the appli-

cation of the leading results of each. Scientific Geography, in fact, formed the

best possible view of the aggregate result of all the forces of Nature in a connected

form. The author then gave a sketch of the system according to which, in his

estimation, geographical observations ought to be treated in order to comply with

the requirements of scientific method. He confessed that it might be difficult to

realize this ideal in its completeness, and that the difficulty might be thought

insuperable to a generation that has not received even an elementary education in

physical science                                                                but he had great  hopes  of the future.  In applying his concep-
                                                                             ;

tion of geography to a description of the climate of India, he showed, by the aid of

original diagTam-maps, illustrative of the varying amount of rainfall, the tempera-

ture at difterent seasons, and the distribution of vegetation, how these phenomena

could be explained as dependent on each other.

On the Question "Is the Asiatic Emigration to the West Indies lil-ely to he
  a Fennanent Fact in Modern Oeograpliy ? " By Sir G. Young, Bart., one
   of the late Royal Commissioners to British Guiana.

   After speaking of the condition of the few aborigines still to be found in the

West Indies, and more particularly of those in British Guiana, the author de-

scribed the state of the African portion of the population.

   The negroes, notwithstanding all the waste of life and moral deterioration induced
by slavery, had taken root in the soil, had been emancipated, and now formed tho

bulk of the population throughout the Antilles and in Guiana. The census returns

showed that their rate of increase was very slow. In Guiana it was given at 9000

in ten years, upon a population standing in 18G1 at 93,000, or a little under

1 per cent, per annum. He thought, however, that this might be looked upon as

a temporary depression, and ascribed in part to the circumstances peculiar to a

improvement in the domestic morals and in their treatment of their children, such

as might reasonably be expected to accompany their growing material prosperity,

would most probably restore their multiplying-power, which in the time of slavery

stood higher than at present. It could not be doubted that the establishment of

the African race in tropical America would continue to be a fact in modern

geography                                      and                              what  they had now to    ask was,  whether the  new Asiatic immi-

gration was of such dimensions and endued with such conditions of permanency

as to render it capable of holding its own alongside the existing agriculturist

negro population, and becoming in its tm-n a geographical fact. Economically

speaking, the answer was of the utmost moment. The Africans, for the most part,

contented with the sweets of liberty, and as yet new to the stress of those desires

after luxury and comfort which impelled free races to hard continuous labour, had

long ceased either to reside on the plantations or to supply them with labour

sufficiently regular to ensure their profitable cultivation. From the ruin which,

owing to this and other causes, fell upon the British West-Indian colonies twenty-

five years ago, they had been resuscitated by tlie State-aided officially regulated

Oriental immigration. Capital had been drawn to them afresh, fields had been

reclaimed, public works undertaken, and a new era of prosperity appeared to have
--216 REPORT 1872.

been entered upon, owing" to tlie introduction of the Coolies. Trinidad, "whicli

formerly stood low among her neighbours in point of enterprise and wealth, had

doubled the area of cultivation and the amount of produce ; the value of estates in

Jamaica had in some cases already doubled since the Coolies, four years ago, began

again to come after a six years' prohibition. It would be asked if it was possible

that the resvdts of the introduction of Africans during the time of the slave-trade

could be matched by the immigration of Asiatic volunteers brought from a greater

distance by government ships, under a system liable to be stopped at the first outcry
of philanthropists, and so closely guarded that, as we learnt from the last Report

of the Emigi'ation Comniissiouers, the mortality during the Middle Passage had been
reduced to below 20 in the 1000, a better rate than that obtained in many parts of

England. Since 184.3, however, 137,.57o East Indians, 16,2222Chinese, altogether

1.53,797 of these immigrants, had arrived in the West Indies, Guiana and Trinidad

between them taking nearly all the Chinese and 8Q per cent, of the Indians. The

average was 5000 every year during this period of thirty years ; but for fourteen

years of that time the immigration was very imperfectly developed, and occasionally

even stopped. Since 1856 the average had been upwards of 7500 per annum, aud

during the last five years, in which no Chinese had come, the average arrival of

Indians had been 78G2 ; and there were no signs that there would be any falling
ott' in the number so long as the laws of supply and demand were allowed to

operate without interference. But this immigration was in its principle a tem-
Aporaiy sojourn, not a permanent transference of home.
                                                        return passage was pro-

vided gratis for all East-Indian immigrants who had resided ten years in the

colony, and served one five years' .indenture ; and the Chinese, although their

return passage was not paid, were free to go at the end of ten years, and they were

notoriously given to returning to their homes from other places. These facts, how-

ever, were of less importance than they might at first seem. At the present time

less than 15,000 out of 1.37,000 Indians had claimed a return passage, while the

number of them who had already spent ten years in the colony must amount by this

time to 40,000 at least. The diminution in the number of applications for a

return passage in the last year or two was traceable to the opening of Cro^Ti lands

and the ofier of allotments to coolies in exchange for their right of return. Thus,

in Trinidad, 285 time-expired immigTants had already received allotments, and

96 others had purchased 910 acres at a stipulated price. The consequent saving

to the colony already exceeded £4000. The lead of Trinidad was to be followed
shortly by Guiana and Jamaica. It was worthy of remark that the planters, who

originally opposed the scheme, fearing lest the coolies, like the negroes, should

withdraw from plantation labour, now desired to have coolie villages in their

neighboui-hood, finding that the free labourers so settled were glad to work for

them. It was not yet possible to .answer the question of the increase of the

Asiatic population by statistics. The mortality for the first ten years was

frightful : the Commissioners lately in Guiana estimated that it reached 10 per

cent, per annum. In 1851 one third of the whole number introduced within six

years were already dead. The improved regulations of the passage, however, and
the very gi-eat efforts of the planters and Colonial Governments, had brought down

the mortality to a mere fraction of the former death-rate. lu Guiana and Trinidad

it fluctuated between 3 and 4 per cent. An important Government department

was charged with the supervision of all matters in which the interests of the
Acoolies were affected.
                         special labour law, on which great pains h.ad been spent,

was administered by stipendiary magistrates, in order to secure them wonj at

fair wages. Medical aid was provided gratuitously, and no estate was without its
hospital. After twenty years of this improved aud still improving system, we

found in Guiana that, of a population of 200,000, one fourth, or 49,000, were

immigrants from Asia, while GOOO more were children of those immigrants, called

Creole coolies in the colony. In Trinidad, of a population of 110,000, there were

24,500 immigrants and 5500 Creole coolies, making 30,000 in all. The female sex
was as yet sadly deficient in numbers. The Colonial Office insisted on a minunvm
of 40 to every 100 males who were recruited, aud would increase the propoition
but for the extreme difiicultj^ of making up the quota without resorting to women

of a character likely to neutralize all the benefits intended by their introduction.

             ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

            Address hij Prof. H. Fawcext, M.P., President of the Section.

The President opened the proceedings of this Section, and after a few introductory

--remarks, said : Every one has been saying that we have been for some time past,

and that we are at the present moment, enjoying unprecedented prosperity in this
country. If the well-b iing of a nation could be solely estimated by the amount of
wealth which is produced at home, and by the quantity of commodities which are
imported from abroad, it julght be concluded that England was rapidly arriving

at a state of perfection, and that all her people were in process of securing an ample
supply of the necessaries and comforts of life. Let us for a moment, then, ask
whether such a result is likely to be realized by the prosperity which at present
prevails. People are beginning to remark that prices are rapidly rising ; and it
seems to be discovered that the more prosperous the nation is said to be, the more

certainly does an aiivance take place in the price of many of the fii-st necessaries
of life. If we are told that never before was so much wealth produced, that never
before were the wages of so many classes of labourers so high, it may be with
truth rejoined that never before were many articles of daily consumption so dear.

There has been also a general rise in house-rent. It is at once obvious that unless
 the increased wealth which is produced is generally diffused throughout the nation,

it will of course follow that in consequence of the rise of prices some people may find

 themselves not more prosperous, but worse oft" than they were before. There are a

 great many people whose incomes are either fixed in pecuniary amount or are regu-
 lated by customs which, if not unchangeable, require many years to be modified.
 Nothino- is more common than, when a man dies, to leave his widow or his daughters
 a fi.xed income. Sometimes the income is derived from propert}' which trustees

 are ordered to invest in some security such as the funds, in which the rate of interest
 is fixed ; sometimes the income is a fixed pecuniary charge upon some property or
 business. Then, again, there is a numerous class, such as half-pay ofiicers and super-

 annuated clerks, whose incomes are also fixed. There are also others, such as clergy-

 men, clerks, and others, in the receipt of salaries, whose incomes may ultimately

 advance if there is a general rise in prices ; but after the rise has taken place, a con-
 siderable time will elapse before the advance is secured. It must also be borne

 in mind that although there maybe a great increase in trade, yet the iiicrease may

 not affect every business ; and therefore in those branches of industry which remain
 imchanged, employers and employed may for a considerable time be unable to secure
 anv increase in their remuneration at all commensurate with the augmentation in the
 cost of living. The operative and the miner have secured an advance of 20 or 30
 or 40 per cent, in their wages ; but it does not invariably follow that these advancing
 profits and this increase in "wages should be at once accompanied by a corresponding
  advance in profits and wages in other industries and in other localities. If there is
 a great increase in the production of wealth, accompanied by a rise in the price of

 many of the necessaries of life, it does not follow that all are at once benefited
 but, on the contrary, many temporarily suffer severely. 'VMien trade rapidly
 increases, it may happen, as it does at the present time, that there is a transfer of

 wealth, that some people are getting poorer as others are getting richer. In the

 congratulations which we indulge about national prosperity, let us not forget those
218 REPORT--1872.

who not only do not at once participate in its advantages, but wlio actually suffer
in couseqiicnce of it. But it may he asked, is the rise in prices, which is now so

marked a feature in the economic condition of England, caused by the general

activity of trade, or is it simply an accidental coincidence ? If nothing- occurs
either to increase the supply of the precious metals, or if no change in the method

of conducting business enables their use in many transactions to be dispensed with,

it is a well-known principle of economic science that an increased production of

wealth would cause, not a general rise, but a general decline in prices. It has,

however, happened that, contemporaneously with the great development of trade

vrhich has occurred during the last twenty years, there lias been an enormous

increase in the production of the precious metals. It has been calculated that the

total yield of gold since the gold discoveries in Aush-alia and California, a little

more than twenty years since, is about £500,000,000. This is supposed to be

nearly equivalent to the entire quantity of gold existing in the world preA iously.

There has also been a considerable augmentation in the production of silver. The

effect which has thus been produced in cheapening the precious metals, or, in other

words, in effecting a general rise in prices, has been greatly assisted by an extended

Whenuse of credit, partly owing to greater facilities in banking.  the gold dis-

covei'ies in Australia and California first became known, many predicted that there

would be a great and almost immediate depreciation in the value of this metal.

This prediction was not fulfilled. The gold discoveries occurred just at the time

when tliere was a great development of trade, partlj- prqduced by the introduction

of free trade, by the extended application of steam to indu.stry, and by the develop-

ment of the railway system. The additional supplies of gold were consequently for

some time absorbed without any decline in its value. It can now, however, be

scarcely doubted by any attentive observer that a considerable depreciation has

taken place, and that this is indicated by a marked rise in prices, which is erro-

neously supposed to be due, not to this cause, but to a general activity in trade.

The rise in prices which has taken place since 1850 is estinitated by eminent

authorities as not less than 40 or 50 per cent. This circumstance partly accounts

for the fact that the augmentation which has taken place in the production of

wealth has not produced a greater and more perceptible influence upon the general

well-being of the country'. If, for instance, we discover that during the past year

10 per cent, more wealth, estimated in money, was produced than in the previous

year, and if during the same period there has been, owing to a depreciation in the

value of the precious metals, a rise in prices of 5 per cent., it is at once obvious

that one lialf of this supposed increase of wealth is not real, but simply nominal,

because all connnodities have advanced 5 per cent. It is not, of course, intended

to be implied that there has not been a large and real increase in the production of

wealth. It is, however, important not to omit the deduction to which allusion

has just been made. lint the reason which induced liini to refer to the present

general rise in prices was threefold. In the first place, he wished to point out the

hardship and suil'ering which it will, at any rate for a time, cause to certain sections

of tlie community ; secondly, to show what precautions should be taken in order,

as far as possible, to mitigate the influence of a similar cause in future ; and,

thirdly, to draw the practical conclusion that at the present time certain classes

who are most unfavourably affected by the peculiar economic circumstances of the

country are the very people upon whom the burden, both of imperial and local

taxation, falls with peculiar severity and inequality. But it may probablj' be said,

is not the present advance in prices temporary ? Is there any possibility that it

can continue and increase ? In answer to such inquiries, it would be presumptuous

to give a positive, dogmatic answer. There is probably no subject on which it is

more hazardous to prophecj' than on the future yield of the precious metals. Some

people may argue that the yield of gold from Austraha and California cannot be

maintained. On the other hand, it may be urged with equal plausibility that the

j'ield of gold may be greatly increased as labour in tliese countries becomes more

plentiful, and as improved methods of mining are introduced. Without, however,

attempting to decide between these two opposite opinions, we will adopt a middle

course, and assume that about the present yield will be maintained. If this should

be the case, it cannot be do.ubted that there will be a steady depreciation in the
IRAKSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  219

value of the precious metals, and a coiTcsponding advance in general prices ; and it
is obvious that if the rise in prices should continue, the loss which -will be endured
by those in receipt of fixed money-incomes ^vill also continue. This being the

case, -^ve arrive at the second of the" three points enumerated, and we have to seek

--R reply to the important practical question What can be best done to mitigate

the consequences resulting from such a loss ? One or two practical conclusions
may be ventured upon. In the first place, it is hazardous to tie down trustees or
executors to invest money in some security in which the rate of interest is fixed.
If the money is invested in any kind of property, or in shares which represent pro-
perty, the money value of the property and of the shares will advance with the
rise in prices. "Worlvmen and others who can only make veiy small investments

from time to time may, it is thought, have a great difiicultyin finding such invest-
ments as those just recommended. It is, however, at once evident that if they pur-
chase their dwelling-house by joining a building society, or if they invest_ their

money in shares in some cooperative undertaking, they would avoid the risk of

finding the value of their savings depreciated by a depreciation in the value of

money and this risk they would run if they set aside a weekly sum to purchase
                                       ;

an annuity to commence some years hence. It may seem that some of these sug-

gestions afford an argument against life insurance ; but this is really not the case

if a judicious choice of an office is made by those who insure. Many offices divide
their profits, over a certain fixed percentage, among the policy-holders. If, there-
fore, the money is judiciously invested by the company, the money value of their

property will increase with the rise in prices; consequently the amount to be dis-

tributed among the policy-holders will increase, and will afford a compensation for
the diminution in the purchasing-power of the policy when it is paid. The third

--point to which he wished briefly to direct attention is the following : In the

present circumstances of the country, the possessors of small fixed incomes are

those who participate least in the advantages resulting from activity of trade, and
are also those who sufier most from the present rise in prices ; and there is no class
upon whom the burdens of local and imperial taxation probably fall with so much
severity. As examples, take a widow, a clerk, a curate, or a half-pay officer, with
an income of £200 a year. They are liable to the income-tax. The income-taxis
not only made a permanent part of our fiscal system, bat a precedent was set last
year for defraying exceptional expenditure by means of the income-tax. No class

probably has to spend so large a proportion of their income in house-rent ; and it is,

after all, upon the occupiers of houses that by far the most crushing effect of local
taxation falls. But the most serious injustice that seems to be done them is associated

with our poor-law system. lu those branches of industry Avhich are exceptionally
prosperous enormous profits are realized, and a great advance in wages is secured.

The additional wages are, to a great extent, spent and not saved. They are spent

in the purchase of more beer, spirits, meat, Initter, or the other articles of daily use.

The price of some of these articles advances with this extra demand, and the

possessors of fixed incomes sufler accordingly. No one would suppose that he

(Prof. Fawcett) did not rejoice in seeing the workman receive a better remuneration
for his labour, and have an opportunity of enjoying more leisure. But if his extra
wages are all spent, and nothing is laid by, what may happen? Why, trade may
become dull. Instead of there being the present demand for labour, tens of thousands

of hands may have to be discharged. Nothing having been saved in prosperous
days, how will they live without work ? They will be able to claim the right to

be maintained out of the rates, to no small extent contributed by the very class

(the possessors of small fixed incomes) who do not now share in the present pros-

perity, and who find the cost of living increasiu"-. This is the injustice to which

he alluded. Not only does this injustice exist, but there is reason to fear that it

may be increased. There is a general feeling at the present day that the burdens

of local taxation press unfairly on certain classes. Admitting that some reform is

needed, it must be home in mind that unless we are careful we shall, in striving
after greater equality, secure greater inequality. Some have gone so far as to

suggest that there should be a national poor-rate, or, in other words, that the sup-

port of the poor should be made an imperial charge. But even if such an extreme

proposal as a national poor-rate is not carried out, there is a demand, influentially
220 REPORT--1872.

urged, that many local charges should, in part at least, be defrayed out of the
Consolidated Fund. Without now attempting to decide whether such a proposal
ought to be carried out, it should bs remembered that two very serious dangers

are associated with it, which ought certainly to be most carefully guarded against.
In the first place, local authorities think that public money is no one's money, and

consequently localities would vie with each other in getting as much out of the
Consolidated Fund as possible. He had felt it his duty, on more than one occa-
sion, to warn people against supposing, as they sometimes seem to do, that the
Consolidated Fund is a great source of wealth, kept perennially supplied by the
spontaneous bounty of nature. The Consolidated Fund represents taxation. If
more money is obtained from tlie Consolidated Fund for local purposes, what new

taxes is it proposed to levy ? or which of the existing taxes is it proposed to

increase? This question will be answered by the electors, the majority of whom

are not the payers of income-tax. They have been encouraged by what has been
done in the past to throw the whole extra charge on the income-tax; and the
income-tax would fall with the greatest inequality upon the possessors of small
fixed incomes, who are placed in the most unfavourable position by the general
economic circumstances of the country. Allusion has already been made to a
remarkable rise of prices which is going on at the present time. So far as the
increasing dearness of commodities is due to such natural causes as the demands of
a larger population, it would be neither possible nor desirable to attempt to control
it. Indications, however, are not wanting that the cost of producing many com-
modities may be artificially augmented by the incessant demands which are con-

stantly being put forward for mischievous legislative interference with industry.

If we had time to examine the various measures that were introduced into Parlia-
ment last year, and the various measures with which we are threatened next
Session, it would not be difficult to show that, unless we are very careful, industry
will be hampered by State interference much in the same way as a machine would
be if sand were thrown among its wheels. Such lessening of industrial efficiency
would increase the cost of producing commodities, and the great mass of the people
would have greater difficulty than they have now in obtaining either a sufficiency

of the necessaries or an adequate supply of the comforts of life.

Statistics regardinrf tlie Attendance and Education of Girls in the Elementary

   In a recent speech at Willis's Rooms, the Bishop of London is reported to have
said, "In the lower classes the girls were as well provided for in the matter of
education as the boys." This statement appears to be one of those comfortable
delusions by which men, who do not care to discuss what are called women's
rights, blind themselves to the actual condition of the feminine portion of the com-
munity. The education and remuneration of the teachers of girls prescribed
by the code of the Education department are inferior to those of the teacliers of
boys, and consequently an inferior quality of instruction is the natural result.
Besides these disadvantages, which operate uniformly over the land, there are
others which may vary according to the character of the population and of the
district. There is a general belief that education is less desirable for girls than for
boys. More scliools are provided for boys tlian for girls. Girls are more frequently
kept at home to attend to nursing or household labour than boys. The operation
of these causes is strikingly shown in the experience of the School Board of Man-
cliester. The number of children to be provided with school accommodation in
the district of Manchester is (according to the calculation adopted by the Educa-
tion department, namely one sixth of the population) 58,557, consisting of

16,396 boys,_ 16,982 girls, 25,179 iufants. Tlie wliole accommodation provided by

all classes of elementary schools within the city was, when the Board began its

work, for 48,548 children, and it was thus divided :--for boys, 18,795 ; for girls,

14,603                             infants,  15,150.  Thus, while there is a total deficiency of 10,000 in the

number of school-seats compared to the number of children, there is an actual

excess of 2399 for boys over the total number of boys in Manchester, and a defi-

ciency of 2379 in the accommodation for g-irls.

Turning from quantity to quality of education, we find a still greater disparity

between the sexes. The following statistics regarding the subjects studied were

--out that there are now in use two systems of decimal coinage ilie French, hased

on tlie franc, and Die American, based on the dollar; five dollars being equal to
twenty shillings and ten pence, and twenty-five francs to nineteen shillings and
seven ponce, one standard of \alac being thus slightly above, and the other slightly
below the English, lie gives the preference to the former of these two systems,

but considers that one better than either may be formed from our English coinage,

by doubling our pound for the largest unit and dividing by 10, 100, and 1000,
making four coins of account of the respective values of 40a'. and 4s. and nearly
6d. and ^d. These four coins he has named arcJi (from the Greek dpxr], and as
used in monarch &c.), dor (French d'or, golden), silver penny, and an (old English
one), but lays uo stress on these names, which he does not consider an essential

point.

    These coins (except the smallest) he would, for convenience of currency, divide

=into halves and quarters, making altogether four gold coins 40s., 20s., 10s., 4s.,
= =four .silver coins 2s., Is., M., '2\d., and one bronze com \d., thus using the chief

part of our present issue without alteration, the only coins that could not be used
being the half-cro'wn, the sixpence, and the fourpenny and threepenny pieces;

the bronze penny might be allowed to go gradually out of circulation, no new ones

1)eing coined. That despised and troublesome coin, the farthing, would be abolished
altogether, the experience of both France and America showing that no coin so
small is necessary ; the smallest coin in circulation would agree with the smallest

denomination of account, as it now does in America but not in France, while the
largest would also agree with the largest, as it now does not in either France or

America.

   The actual values of the coins of difi'orent countries would be made to agTee
by being raised or lowered as each case requires ; but as the English values hold
the medium place, and her pound sterling is a value universally well understood
and appreciated, and she herself is the acknowledged centre of the commercial
world, her standard seems to be the most natural and ad-^-antageous that can be

chosen.

   The French mint might raise the values of its coins to accord with ours, by

ceasing to charge a seignornge for coining, but giving to each coin a weight of its

full value in brdlion as is now done in England : this, if universally adopted, must

greatly facilitate transactions in bullion, as its value would be exactly expressed

by its weight in coin.
  * Our English accounts would bo converted into the new denominations by divid-

ing the pounds by two, the shillings by four, and the pence by five, adding one an

for every shilling reduced to pence for the puii^ose of division.

   The French accounts would require simply dividing by five ; the American only
that the decimal point .should be shifted one figure further .back ; for example :

largest denomination would make a very handsome and convenient gold coin

other too large.

and twenty to the largest, the arch.

   The system here advocated will be seen to be much better suited for lai'ga
accounts than is that of the Americans (which is thought by them destined to
replace all others), yet so near au approach to it as to make it very easy for them
to convert theirs into it : it would also be a much easier change for France than
the adoption of her system would be for us.

   Many countries have now in use coins nearly agreeing with some here proposed

indeed there is a remarkable series of coins very near in value to the proposed
dor, 4?. This approximation, though of no use for international purposes, which

--would require exact agreement, would avoid any great disturbance in the internal

commerce of each country the new coins agreeing so nearly with the old that one
would be commonly accepted as equivalent to the other, as our bronze pennies are

taken as of the same value as the copper coins which they have replaced, although
intrinsically worth less.

        On Polygaimj as affecting Pojiulatlon. Bg Hyde Clarke, F.S.S.

   By the investigation of new facts obtained from the lives of the Turkish Sultans,

and the kings and princes of Europe, it was proved that polygamous individuals
do not produce a lai-ger permanent progeny than the monogamous, and that popu-

lation is not increased by the union of one man with a large number of women,
but limited by the law of fecundity in man. Although the total number of births,
the offspring of one man, maybe large, and cases were cited of above one hundred,

the progeny surviving in his lifetime or perpetuated afterwards in no case exceeds

that of a man married to one woman at a time or successively. It was further

suggested that an element in the perpetuation of polj'gamous issue is intermarriage
with the offspring of the monogamous.

Suggestions for improving and extending our National Accounts ; being a
    continuation of Mr. FeUows's Paper read at the Edinburgh Meeting, " On

    a proposed Doomsday Boole, cfv."' Bg Frank P. Fellows, F.S.S.

    This paper commenced by assuming that the previous suggestions of the author
<' On a proposed Doomsday Book, giving the Value of Governmental Property as a
 basis for a sound system of Accounts," would be endorsed by the present Meeting,
 and that it was not therefore necessary again to discuss tjieni. This the author
 assumed because the Statistical and Economic Section of the British Association
 had at Edinburgh, after the reading of that paper, unanimously passed the follow-
 ing resolution, which, as it also stated the groundwork of that paper-, was given
 here, as forming the text or commencement of the paper about to be read. The
 resolution was as follows :

    " That this meeting having heard Mr. Frank P. Fellows's paper on a proposed
 Doomsday Book, giving the value of national Government property as a basis of a
 sound system of national finance and accounts, desires to urge upon the Go-\-ern-
 ment the great importance of the subject, and would strongly recommend that
 measures be taken to inquire into and report upon the question. The Meeting
 desires further to express its opinion that each Government department should
 have, like railway or other public companies, a capital and a current account,
 without which it deems it impracticable to have a reliable system of finance and
 accounts, and would suggest that a scheme of accounts should be introduced by

 which a unity may be established between the Parliamentary finance and depart-

 mental expense or other accounts, in order that the various sums voted by the

 House of Commons may be traced to their ultimate appropriation in statistical
 results, and so that greater control may be obtained over the national expenditure,

 and that the President (Lord Neaves) be requested to communicate this resolution
 to the Government authorities."

   This was moved by Sir John Bowring, F.R.S., and was seconded by Mr. H. W,

 Freeland, late M.P. for Chichester, andVas carried unanimously.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      225

   After briefly recapitulating- the main points of the paper read at the Edinburgh

Meeting- last year, viz. " On a proposed Doomsday Book, gi"ving- the Value of

Uovernmental Property as the basis for a sound system of National Accounts," tlie
paper proceeded to develop still further the author's vie-n's as to the manner in

which Government departmental accounts should be prepared for the information of

I'arliament. In the paper read at Edinburgh, it -was suggested by the author that,
in addition to the main proposal of the paper, a Doomsday Book of National (as

distinguished from Governmental) property might also be compiled after the
manner of the old Doomsday Itook of ^^ illinm the Conqueror ; and this minor sug-
gestion had been advocated by the ' Spectator ' and oilier influential papers and

also by Earl Derb}^, and there seemed some probability of its being carried into

eft'ect.

   The great object, however, of the main proposal (i.e. of having a Doomsday

Book giving the value of Government property) -was to obtain thereby the basis
of a good system of Parliamentary and Departmental accounts, by -which expendi-
ture for the current purposes of the year might be distinguished from expenditure

--«-hich really -tt'cnt to increase the capital of the Government -which, for instance,

v.'ent to increase its land, buildings, stores, &c.

   It -was urged that there could be no eihcieut check on expenditure or the results

of expenditure by Parliament if disbursements for capital and for current purposes
were not clearly distinguished, as departments might obtain from the House

£·10,000,000 and expend either £11,000,000 or only 9,000,000, simply because the

extra million might be obtained by reducing the capital {i.e. plant, buildings,
stores, &c.), or by not maintaining them to their usual value, and thus £11,000,000
be spent for current purposes ; or £1,000,000 extra might be expended for increasing
the capital (in plant, buildings, stores, &c.) of the department, and thus only

£9,000,000 be spent for the current purposes of the year in question.

   The author pointed out in detail how the various departmental accoimts should

be compiled, so as to give the heads of Departments and Parliament greater control,

so that they might see not merely that the money was disbursed to the proper

--recipients, and that there was no malappropriation, but that they have value for

the money expended that is, Expense or [Statistical accounts of some kind (and
the author pointed out how this could be done) should be compiled to show the

results of expenditure.

    To object to the expense of obtaining this information appeared like objecting
to have reins to drive the coach on account of the expense of such reins, and
electing to let the horse and coach take their own course.

    In illustration, the author pointed out that between the years 1863 and 1866 he
 had discovered, and Mr. Secly had mentioned in the House of Commons, about
 thirty ships -n-hich had been repaired during that time by the Admiralty, the cost

of such repairs being about equal to the sum for which similar new ships could
have been bought. It was a rough rule with shipbuilders that an old repaired
ship was worth about half as much as a similar new ship, so that there had been

a loss on these ships of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. An account of

theni would bo found in the Appendix to the Eeport of Mr. Seely's Committee of

the House of Commons of 1808, " On Admiralty Monies and Accoimts."
   This was now obviated by the system of Expense accounts and by the way they

 are utilized at the Admiralty, so that such cases could not well occur again.
    In the author's opinion three things were necessary for a perfect check :
    1st, audit of cash ; 2nd, audit of stores, as to quantity, for stores are money's

 value, and an audit of them is as necessary as an audit of cash ; 3rd, Expense or
 Statistical accounts showing the results of expenditure in ships built, repaired,^
articles produced, or in other results. Without this we may have perfect audit of
cash ; and of stores we may see that the stores said to have been used to a ship have
been so used, and yet they"may have been used very improperly, or may have been
 employed uselessly, as in the cases of excessive cost of repairs of ships given in
this paper, or expensive stores or labour may be used where inexpensive stores or
 labour would suflfice. In fact gold may be used instead of iron, and hundreds of
 thousands of ])ounds be wasted in this way ; and the heads of Departments and
the House of Commons, seeing that they have a perfect check or audit of cash and
--326 REPORT 1872.

stores, may be perfectly satisfied, and be thus lulled into a false security. Tlio

author urged the necessity of such accounts being- initiated and supervised by au
independent authority outside the Departments, and gave suggestions in detail as

to how this might be done,

On the National Union for Improving tlie Education of Women.

                           Bg Miss SnuiREFF.

This Association dates only from November last year, when a public meeting was

held to inaugurate it upon a plan previously sketched out bj'- Mrs. William Grey,

and to name a central committee for its management. The long list of members
now shown by the circulars of the Union, recognition of its work by important

public bodies, numerous local committees formed and provincial societies affiliated,

mark the progress made during the few months of its existence. Of the work pro-

posed it is only possible to say here that the scheme aims at correcting the deep

and widespread defects in women's education, by bringing into extensive co-

operation all existing efforts at reform, by using all endeavours through as many

channels as possible to kindle a deeper interest on the subject, and to combat the

indifference of parents and of the public.

That indifference rests mainly on the absence in the case of girls of those direct

motives of interest which prompt the instruction of boys. Those motives might

--be seen to exist by all who consider the waste of national resources caused by the

ignorance of women half the intellectual force of the nation allowed to do no

work for the community. In sanitary questions, in questions of expenditure, of

luxury, of the earliest training of children, the loss caused by the ignorance of
Awomen is beyond calculation.

traced not to want of technical training, but to want of cidtivated 'intelligence.

Fathers might feel that, even as a question of domestic economjs they would gain

by enabling daughters to earn salaries, and their- own business might gain in points
beyond money value if their daughters were taught to take a share in it.

   The evil and the loss are immense, and they are justly charged upon men,

because the wealth and power of the country and of each family are in their hands,

and they have refused to women the me'ans of purchasing the education they
require. The National Union, in its labour for reform, v\'ill eai-nestly press this

view. But, besides striving to influence public opinion, it enters zealously into

all practical schemes for improving the education and supplementing the very
scanty means that exist of obtaining proper instruction for girls, such as classes

for ladies and for working women, attendance at examinations, &c. It also gives
earnest attention to the work of obtaining a fair share for girls of the rich endow-
ments which in many cases were originally intended to benefit them, but which
have been monopolized for the use of: boys.

But its most important work is the spread of good schools. They are wanted

everywhere, and for the whole portion of society which separates " those whose

ciiildren attend the elementary schools from the wealthy and aristocratic.

   Some good schools exist, more probably than are known : Miss Beale has raised

the Ladies' College at Cheltenham to the rank of a great educational institution,

and Miss Buss offers us in Loudon the very model we desire to follow ; but a few
such schools only point the contrast and make the general want more apparent.
The Union has determined on trying the instrumentality of a limited liability
company, by means of which, not one school but a whole'system of schools shall

in succession be foimded. This plan is now commencing operations. The Girls'
Public Day-school Company is about to establish its first school in the S.W.

district of London. The fees in such schools cannot be so low as in endowed
                                                                                                  ;

scliools, for they must be such as wiU afford not only tho higliest payment that
can secure first-rate teaching, but a moderate dividend on the capital, without

which all hope of future schools would be at an end. But too much is otten said

worse arithmetic are taught at the cost of all that strengthens character and disci-

cial company its true educational character; this has been met, as far as possible, by
inserting in' the articles of association some points that are considerexl of the most

fundamental importance. Two only can be mentioned here :--1st. The Company
will found none but public day-schools, opened to all classes and denominations;

2ndly. Every school founded by the Company will have a class of student teachers.
The training of teachers is one of the most important subjects and one ot the most
neglected in Eusjland. It is curious to find that it is still a question supposed to

liberal profession opened to them, and their own ignorance has so depressed their

condition that they occupy a dillerent level altogetlier from that occupied by male

teachers. And, again, all women ought to study education, because by natural

position the large majority of them are necessarily educators, while all more or less
come in contact with children. The conditions of their life require that all s ion d
be fit to be trusted in the nursery as in the sick room, and therefore that all should

study the conditions of health and the principles of education.                          _

an established custom, miglit abstain from reading addresses wliich would be really

instructive to their hearers. This being so I have an excuse for that -which would

otherwise savour of impertinence. I say of impertinence, because it is imdoubted

that many of the Members present, and,'_in fact, probably all the Members present,

are so well instructed in the matters pertaining to our Section, that I cannot put

forward any thing which will be new to them. It is this which gives the appear-

ance of impertinence to an address ; but the custom which renders an address-

obligatory takes away from that appearance. And there is another cause which

also redeems it from that appearance, and that is, that although the hearers of the

address will not hear any thing which they did not know before, it may bring things

to their minds which they did know, but which were lying, as it were, in abey-

ance ; and thus they may be forcibly reminded of subjects which they had some-
what neglected.

It is on these two grounds of custom and of exciting attention to that which may

be for the moment forgotten, that I alone venture to take up time by addressing

gentlemen, many of whom are my seniors, if not in life, at least in experience of

our profession.

The question now arises. What, among the vast range of matters which fall

within the scope of the Mechanical Section of the British Association, shall I select

for the subject of my address ?
  I am aware that some of our former Presidents, on taking the Chair, have dealt

--generally with the progress and state of engineering knowledge, they have, in fact,

generalized. But ni order to render an address of this kind useful, the writer of

it must be a man of a grasp of intellect sufficiently large to really take in the leading

subjects of Mechanical Science, and to deal with them in a comprehensive although

a compendious manner. Such a power as this is possessed but by few, by the few

who are men of deep thought and large experience, and who have the faculty not

only of appreciating that which is taking place roiuid about them, but the further

faculty of arranging, classifying, and putting into methodical order the various facts

which their minds have embraced, and then of connnunicating the very essence of

this mental arrangement to those whom they address.

Such powers and faculties unhappilj' are not mine : I will not therefore attempt

a task in which I must signally and utterly fail were I to essay it, and I must con-

mytent myself M-ith confining                                                                                          observiitions to some one subject of interest.

The point I now have to determine is, what shall my one subject be ? on what

shall I address you ?

  I have thought over many subjects connected with IMechanical Science, but I
cannot discover any thing more practically important than " Coal." Very few

matters are of greater real interest at all times to the nation at large, and very few

are more prominently before the minds of the public at the present time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and cer-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

tainly no subject can be more appropriate for a mechanical engineer, if for no other

reason than this, that the steam-engine is still the very crowning glory of mecha-

nical engineering, and that coal is the staff' of life and, so to speak, the breath of

the nostrils of the steam-engine.

I am aware it may be said that the subject of coal is a hackneyed one : no doubt

feature of the matter                                                                                                  and with respect to the statistical aspect, I will merely state
                                                                                                                    ;

in reference to it that the raisings of coal, which in 1855 were only 04 millions of

tons in Great Britain, rose to 80 millions in 18G0, and to 108 millions in 18G9 ; and

I will also advert to the fact that the price of all kinds of coal has in the colliery

districts risen, speakiug in round numbers, about 100 per cent, within the last twelve

months, and is still rising.

This increase of consumption and this rise in price are startling facts, and force

us seriously to reflect upon the use and also upon the abuse of coal. These reflections

will make us remember that whatever the kno\\'u store may be, and whatever new

--discoveries of other beds may be made, the supply after all is but a finite quantity

--sumption, tlie fuel coal is given to us once and for all that we are therefore dealing
--with a store that knows no renewal tliat if wo waste it, the sin of that waste
--will be A'isited upon our children and that it becomes us to look upon coal as a

most precious, valuable, and limited deposit, of which we are the stewards and

guardians, j ustified, no doubt, in using all that avo require for legitimate purposes,

but most criminal in respect of all that we waste, whether that waste arise from

wilful indifference or from careless ignorance, an ignorance culpable as the indilfcr-

cuce itself.

   This being so, let us see how we do deal with coal in those cases where coal
must be used, how we might deal with it in such cases, and how we might in
certain instances substitute other sources of po-wer for the coal which we now

consume.

   And let us first of all consider this question of finding sources other than coal

for our motive power.

   Before the steam-engine was so extensively used as it now is, the Avind, the force

of streams, and the force of the tide were all employed to give motive power.

   With respect to the power of the wind, it is to be feared it is too irregular to

enable any manufacturer to rely upon it in competition with the steam-engine.
   AVith respect to the power of our streams, the altered condition of the soil, due

to increased dj'ainage and cultivation, has so materially interfered with the regu-

larity of their flow, that their efficiency as sources of constant power is seriously
diminished, while competition with them by steam has become much greater than
it was when^the water-mills themselves were better off. This state of things, how-
ever, might be cured, and, in fact, has been cured in certain districts by the union
of a large number of mill-proprietors to form storage-reservoirs, from which the
water can be delivered with regularity, so as to give a uniform supply to the mills.

   But the third source of water-power, the tide-mill, which at one time was used
to a considerable extent, is now almost wholly discontinued. The causes of this

discontinuance are sufficiently obvious.

   The tide-miU, as formerly constructed, could work for only a limited period in
each ebb ; and, to obtain the full effect, it had to utilize both the night and the
day tides. But while tide-miUs laboured under these disadvantages, thej' possessed
the great merit that their power, such as it was, was one that could be depended
on, and one which, although it fluctuated, fluctuated regularly and within known
and definite limits.

   I Avould suggest that in those cases where there are large manufacturing districts
within a few miles of the sea, and where there is a large rise and fall of the tide,

coupled, in the outset at all events, with natural indentations of the coast, which

might be comparatively readily dammed up for the storage of the water, there
such storage should be made, that the water should be put to work turbines of

the best kind (turbines which will work with very nearly the same percentage of
the total power given out by the water at any particular moment, whether they
are immersed or whether they are not), that these turbines should be employed
in pumping water at a high pressure into Armstrong accumidators, and that pipes
should be laid on from those accumulators to the neighbouring manufacturing town,
and should there deliver their power to the consumers, requiring it to be used by
them in water-pressure engines.

   Suppose a beginning were made with the city of Bristol, which is no doubt a

very favourable insf^ance for the application of this suggestion.
   Here the rise and fall of the tide might safely be taken at 24 feet. Half a square

mile of water enclosed would, after the most lavish deductions for loss, yield in
Bristol at least 5000 horse-power, probably sufficient to replace the whole of the

power of the stationary engines now at work in Bristol.

   I will not detain you by further dilating upon this subject ; but it does appear
to me, looking at the opportunity which good turbines give of utilizing the power
residing in water under constantly varying conditions of head, looking at the fact

that by Sir William Armstrong's arrangements this power may be transferred to

an extremely small quantity of water under high pressure, and that therefore such

--water may be transmitted for many miles through pipes at low Aclocities, even

although those pipes be of no great size, looking at these facts, I say, I cannot
230 REPORT--1873.

help thinking that there is here open to the talent of the mechanical engineer a

new field of enterprise, and one which, if successful, would tend to economize the
fuel we so much value/aud to leave more of it for consumption in metallurgical

operations asid in other operations requiring heat.

    Before quitting the subject of finding som'ces of power other than steam, the

Section will perhaps permit me to remind them of what has been done in the town
of Schafi'hauseu by a public-spirited inhabitant in the way of utilizing the water-

power of the Rhine, and of laying it on, so to speak, to every man's door. This
has been accomplished by erecting turbines, which are worked hy the river, and
deliver their power to endless wire ropes carried over pulleys placed alongside the
Rhine, the rope extending nearly from one end of the town to the other. This
rope gives off power at the end of each street abutting on the river-bank, and that
power is conveyed along those streets by a shaft in a channel under the paving.

Each manufactm'er can make his own commmiication with these principal shafts,
and thus obtain the power he may require. I believe that no more is charged

than is just sufficient to pay for the current repaii'S and for depreciation.

   I will now consider the question how coal is wasted in its use ; but before doing
so I will say a few words upon the loss that occurs in the coal-mine itself Hap-
pily this loss has for some years past been greatly reduced. More economic sys-
tems of working have prevailed, plans of dealing with small coal by washing away

its impurities, so as to render it fit for coking, have been largely adopted, and
thus a great deal of that coal which a few years since would have remained buried

in the mine, as not justifying the expense of raising it to the sm'face and of paying

royalty upon it, is now brought to light and is utilized. Nevertheless we know

that at ordinary prices of coal it is to the advantage of the colliery proprietor, in

many instances, to lea^'e a considerable percentage of the seams that are worked,
rather than to endeavour to lesson that percentage by the use of a more expensive
system of artificial support for the roof ; and, fiuiher, that it also pays him to leave
altogether unworked very thin seams of coal.

   Hereafter, when coal becomes scarce, there can be no question but what the
inhabitants of these islands would be glad to make use of the now despised
im worked seams, and also to recover the buried coal of the worked seams ; but such
seams and such savings, although they can be Avorked and made at present, when

the mines are open, if not at profit, yet with little loss, will then only be capable
of being reached by a reopening and pumping out of abandoned mines, a process
so expensive that great indeed must be the need of our successors if they are com-
pelled to resort to it. It is, however, difficult to see what remedy can be provided

for such a state of things as this. I am far from suggesting that Government

sliould interfere, and should say, " If you work your coal at all, you shall work the
whole of it, and you shall not merely select those portions which will make it the
most profitable speculation for you at the present day, but which will cause a large

percentage to remain ungotten." I am far from suggesting this, as I hold Govern-

ment interference to be in most instances such a mischievous thing that it is, as a
rule, far better to put up with' a certain amount of shortcoming and negligence
than to call in as a remed)' a power which is generally more injurious than that
which has to be remedied. But in the absence of any such interierence, it follows,
from the ordinary principles which regulate commercial transactions, that a con-
siderable percentage of coal in many districts will never be brought to the surface,
because at the present time it does not pay to bring it. Thus in the very outset
v/e are wasting fuel. But the prevention of this source of waste is a question quite
as much for the mining engineer and the political economist as for the mechanical
engineer. I have, however, mentioned it before this Section because the mechanical
engineer may contribute to such prevention by dcAasing new modes of extracting
coal in places where hand-laboiu' would press too heavily upon the men engaged
in the work, and where, therefore, their labom* would be "too costly.

   I now come to the question of the way in which -waste occurs in the use of the

coals that are brought to the smface.

   This use may be divided into two great branches, the domestic and the manu-

facturing. I will consider fii-st the domestic use.
    This is a highly important branch of the subject. It is believed that out of the-
                                                                                                                           ;

                                                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.           231

total of 98 or 99 millions of tons of coal which in 1869 were retained for home use,
18§ millions of tons, about one fifth of that quantity, were consumed for domestic

purposes (about 10 millions being exported).

  We all of us know so intimately the way in which coals are bm-nt for domestic

purposes that I fear it will seem an idle waste of time to describe it. Neverthe-

Weless I really must occupy a few moments in so doing.                                   put a grate imme-

diately below and within a chimney, and as this chimney is formed of brickwork,

by no possibility can more than the most minute amount of heat be communicated

I'rom the chimney to the room. On this grate we make an open fire : fire cannot
bm-n without air, and we provide no means whatever for the air to come into the

fire ; this is a provision that not one architect or builder in a thousand dreams of
making. The consequence is that the unhappy fire has, as it were, to struggle for

existence. In a well-built house especially it has to struggle ; for the doors and

windows shut tightly. The result is that the fire is always smoking, or is on the

Weverge of smoking.                              breathe the noxious gases and we spoil our fiu-niture and

pictures                                         nevertheless, happily for us, the firo  does succeed in getting supplies  of
                                              ;

air which, even although insufficient for the wants of the chimney draught, do

renew the air of the room. If to satisfy the demands of the chimney and to stop

its smoking a window is left a little open or a door is set ajar, we complain of
draughts, and we complain of the uuhomely look caused by sitting in a room with

an open door ; so'that tliere we are, with an asphixiated fire, our smoky rooms, and

our draughty rooms. Moreover, the fire being immediately below the chimney,

the main part of the conducted heat inevitably goes up it and is wasted, leaving
the room to be warmed principally, if not entirely, by the radiated heat ; and we do

iind suffer aU this in order that we may see the fire and be able to poke it. For

myself I must confess that if there was no cure for the evils I have described other

than the close stoves of the Continent, with the invisible fire and with the want of

circulation of air in the room, I would rather put up with the whole of our present

domestic discomforts, and even with the loss of heat, than resort to the stove as a

remedy. But there are modes by which freedom from smoke, freedom from

draught, efficient ventilation, and utilization of the heat^may all be combined with

the presence of the visible pokable fire. Some members of this Association may

recollect the paper that was read before it at the Norwich Meeting in 18G8 by

Captain Douglas Galton, in which he so clearly described his admii-ably simple

invention of fire-grate. This consisted in putting a flue to the upper part of the
fire-grate, which flue passed through a brick chamber formed in the ordinary

chimney, which chamber was supplied with air from the exterior of the room by a

proper channel, and then the air, after being heated in contact with the flue in the

chamber, escaped into the room by openings near the ceiling, so that the room was
supplied -svith a copious volume of warm fresh air, which did away with all ten-

dency to draughts from the doors and windows, and, moreover, furnished an amplo

supply for the purposes of ventilation and combustion. These fire-places, I regret

--to say, have been but little used in England, from a cause 1 shall have to advert to

hereafter a cause which, as I believe, stands in the way of the adoption of improve-

ment generally. The merits of these fire-places were at once f.jknowledged by the
French, who made the most careful and scientific investigation of their working

and they found that with such fire-places three times the effect was obtained from

a given weight of coal that could be got with those of the ordinary construction.

No doubt there are many other plans by which the same end as that attained by
Captain Galton may be arrived at ; and yet we go on year after year building new

houses, making no improvement, exposing ourselves to all the annoyances, and,

worst of all, wasting the precious fuel. Assume that we were to set ourselves

vigorously to work to cure this state of things, can it be doubted that in ten years'
time we might halve the consumption per household, and do that not only without

inflicting any discomfort or depriving the householder of any gratification, but vath
an absolute addition to warmth and an increase of cleanliness, a benefit to health
and a saving of expense ? Moreover it must be remembered that with the imper-

fect combustion of domestic fires, large volumes of smoke are poured into the air.

We know how much freer from smoke town atmosphere is in summer time

than it is ia winter time, and this simply on account of the smaller quantitj^ of coal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !                                ;

that is being burnt. Suppose that -we could reduce the total consumption both in

summer and in winter by 50 per cent., what an enormous boon that would be even

in the one matter of a pure atmosphere

 --The other way in which we use coal is for purposes of manufacture ; and this,

again, may be divided into two branches at least namely, the coal that is employed

for obtaining power and tlie coal that is employed in metallurgical and otlier

operations not immediately connected with the production of power. To treat of

these latter cases first, they are far too numerous to be dealt with in detail, and a

few of the principal therefore only must be considered. Take the siibject of coke-

making. How much coal is heated in clamps and in kilns to be converted into

coke, and in how few instances is any use made of the whole of the heat residing

in the gaseous parts of the coal which are driven off. This heat frequently amounts

to 30 per cent, of the whole of that which is iu the coal.

  We come next to the smelting of iron. Take the preliminary process of calcining

the ore. In those cases where the ore is " black band," the ore so common in

Scotland, the calcining is done by the combustion of the carbonaceous matter

mixed with the ore. Far more than the quantity of fuel requisite for the calci-

nation is  associated with this  ore                but the  whole                                                                                                                                                           of  it  is  burnt o%  and no  effort
                                                 ;

whatever is made to utilize the surplus heat. Then, with regard to the blast-

furnaces for smelting iron. Hero still, almost universally in Scotland, that large

seat of the iron manufacture, and to a considerable extent in England, the waste

gases are suffered to issue from the furnace-top, illuminating the country for miles

round, and bearing testimonj' to the indifference of the owner of the furnaces to a

waste of our store of fuel. ITpwards of GO years ago, viz. in 1811, the utilization

of these gases was suggested in France ; but not much was done for 30 years.

About 1840, however, their use becanae not infrequent in that country, and their

manufacturers and chemists taught ns that the gas thus recklessly wasted might be

collected and utilized, and made to replace the fuel expended in heating the hot

blast-stoves and in raising steam for the blowing-engines. But, for the cause which

has been and will be alluded to, the adoption of this plan was very slow indeed in

England. It has now been in use, however, for many years in our best conducted

works ; but, as a proof of the slowness of its introduction, the furnaces of Scotlnnd,

as I have already said, are even to this day almost universally worked upon the

wickedly wasteful principle of allowing these gases to burn idly away.

Take, again, the melting of steel in crucibles, where the heat issues from the

furnace of necessity hotter than the heat of the melted steel (for were it not so it

would cool it) ; and of this issuing heat, as a rule, no use whatever is made.

Take, again, the heating-furnace and puddling-furnace of our ironworks ; very

commonly from these heat at a greater temperature than that of welding iron escapes

up the chimneys disregarded, as though it had cost nothing for its generation.

In many works, it is true, a portion of this heat is utilized for generating steam

but far more steam can be obtained than is required, even with the most umieces-

sary and lavish consumption of it, and thus in great ironworks boilers in which tlie

steam is generated by the waste heat of the furnaces may be seen constantly blow-

ing off large volumes of steam at the valves ; and many furnaces are iu use to which

no boilers are applied, for the simple reason that they would be absolutely super-

fluous. This waste of heat in steel-melting and in furnaces for iron and for other

metallurgical operations is by no means necessary, although it might be urged that

it is ; and it might be said that if a furnace is to heat a body to 3000 degrees, you

must of necessity allow the heat to escape at that temperature, or rather at some-

thing above it, or else in lieu of heating the body you will be cooling it, and tlurt

you can no more trap escaping heat than you can trap a sunbeam. But one of my

predecessors in this Chair, Mr. Siemens, has, as we know, shown us that you can

trap the heat, and that you can so lay hold of it and store it up that the gases as

they pass into the chimney from the furnace in which there is, say, even melting

steel shaU be lowered in tlieir temperature down to that which will not char a

piece of wood and he has shown us how this stored up heat may be communicated
                                                                            ;

to the separate streams of incoming air and gas of his gas-furnaces, so that tliey

their union and combustion iu the furnace. So beautifully can this trapping of

heat Ijo carried out, and so successfully cau the heat be retained by very trifling
attention on the part of the workmen to the apparatus, that Mr. Ramsbottom, the
late Locomotive >Superiutendont of the London aud North-Western Railway, knew
he should not be applying too delicate a test when he inserted the ends of pieces of
wood through openings into the outgoing flues of the steel-heating furnaces at
Crewe. These pieces of wood were padlocked in their places, were taken out

periodically, and if they were found to be burnt it was known that the man in

charge of the furnace had been negligent in his duty of saving fuel aud had mis-
used the Siemens apparatus. But although this invention has been before the
public for very many years, and although it has had the approval of Faraday and

of every other distinguished scientific man who has investigated the question, and,
I am glad to saj^, the approval of the leading minds among the users of furnaces,

nevertlieless, for the general reason I shall have to allude to, the progress of this
invention has been by no means commensurate with its importance ; and it is not

too much to say that manufacturers would rather waste cheap coal than embai'k
capital in new furnaces, and, more than all, be at the trouble of instructing and of
watching over their workmen.

   Next, let us consider how we are dealing with coal when we use it for obtaining

motive power in our steam-engines.

   Steam-engines may be divided into the four great heads of marine, locomotive,

portable, and fixed. Including within the term steam-engine the boiler as well

as the engine, waste may arise in a steam-engine in two ways, either in one of
them or in both combined. It may arise from an imperfect utilization of fuel in

the production of steam (that is, a waste due to the boiler and to the firing), or it

may arise in an improper use by the engine of the steam provided for it by the

boiler. There can be no question but that the boiler waste is, as a rule, very large

 indeed.

  A pound of fair coal is theoretically capable of evaporating from the boiling-

point 13 lbs. of water. I do not believe that I shall overstate the case when I say
that on fin average not more than from one third to one half of this quantity is

 obtained fronr the whole of the boilers in use.

  --This poor result arises from a variety of causes: 1st, bad firing-, which means

 bad combustion ; 2nd, insufficient surface to absorb the heat ; 3rd, an imclean con-

 dition of that surface either from internal or external deposit, or both ; 4th, a faulty
proportioning of the parts of the boiler to each other and to the work to be done,

--which cause heated water to be carried over with the steam a cause of deficiency

 of evaporation, which, however, so far from being as a rule detected, goes to swell

 the apparent duty of the boiler.

    Bad firing may result in the fire being too thick, or too thin or irregular. If too

 thick, the carbonic acid that is generated by the combustion of the lower part of
 the fuel with which the air first comes in contact is changed in its passage through

 the upper part of the fuel into carbonic oxide, by absorbing from the fuel a second
 equivalent of carbon. If this gas, carbonic oxide, does not meet with free atmo-
 spheric air, and meet with it at a suitable temperature in tlie upper part of the
 furnace, it must remain unconsumed, and will pass through the llues or tubes of
 the boiler and make its escape into the air, carrying with it the valuable uncon-
 sumed carbon of the coal in a gaseous form. It is commonly said that smoke is

 unconsumed fuel. This is true ; but it is not commonly recollected that there may

 be invisible smoke arising (even from a coke-fire) which shall contain the highly

 combustible ingredient carbonic-oxide gas. When it is remembered that every

 pound of coal burnt into carbonic acid is capable of evaporating, as has already

 been said, about 13 lbs. of water from 212°, while a pound of coal converted only

 into carbonic oxide is capable of evaporating but 4 lbs., it will be seen how

 necessary it is that no mismanagement of the fire should cause a portion of the fuel
 thus to escape unburnt up the chimney.

    Another defect in the management of a fire (an opposite defect, as it were) by
 which coal may be wasted is the admission of too much air ; and this arises when
 the fire is too thin in relation to the chimney-draft, or when (a more common evil)
 it is thin in places, owing to the negligence of the firemen in keeping it properly

 levelled.
--234 REPORT 1872.

   The way in wliicli wasto arises from these causes is, that unnecessary air is

introduced into the fire at a temperature of, say, G0°, and that this air has to be
heated, and then (even if the lieat he abstracted from it, as far as practicable by
the boiler) it will escape up the chimney at a temperature of from 200° to 300° in
excess of that which it had; and the whole of this excess represents wasted coal.
Thus, on the one hand, it is of importance that there should bo a proper amount of
air to secure the perfect conversion of the carbon into carbonic acid ; and, on the
other hand, it is most desirable that this amount should not be exceeded, involving
the necessity of uselessly heating air not wanted for combustion. Such a happily
balanced state of things it is almost impossible to secure by hand-tiring-, almost
impossible, but not absolutely impossible, though only attained at competitive trials,
and when these trials are conducted by highljr skilled men.

   In such trials of portable engines before the judges of the Eoyal Agricultural
Society of England, the firemen will put coals upon the fire as frequently as forty-

five times in an hour, the quantity put on at each time being, as may be supposed,

little more than a spoonful.
   Writers on the management of the steam-engine usually advise that the fire-doors

should be opened as little as possible, and that the firing should take place about

every quarter of an hour.

   Under ordinary circumstances they may be right ; but when it is desired, regard-
less of the amount of manual labour, to obtain every particle of useful eft'ect out of

the fuel, it is then found to be remunerative to open the door, not four times an
hour, but more than forty times an hour, taking care, however, that it is only
opened for the fr.action of a second. It is by this frequent feeding of a small
quantity of coal, distributed over the fire, that the competitors are enabled to

insure a uniforin condition of that fire to receive the action of the air. They know
precisely the amount of draught they have got, and by experience they also know
what thickness of tire will exactly balance, as it were, the <air that comes through,
so that the combustion may be perfect, and yet there may be no free air. But in

ordinary hand-tiring, done at intervals of a quarter of an hour, it is obvious that tlie
thickness of the tire at the end of such an interval nnist be very difterent from that
which it was at the beginning of it, and thus if that thickness be right in relation to

the draught at one time it must be wrong at another. At one time, immediately
after tiring, there may be a distillation of the coal, producing blaclc smoke

and carbonic oxide ; this will go on till the fire burns thin and burns into holes,
when there will be a passage of free air. I do not wish to be understood that

I am advocating the attendance of skilled firemen to fire forty-five times in an
hour. Coal must be far dearer than it now is to make it pay so to occupy a man,
or rather watches of men ; for no one man could submit to such continuous labour
for more than from four to five hours. But my observations tend to call your attention

 to the subject of mechanical tiring. I believe that the high evaporative duties that
 have been obtained by the use of liquid fuel, duties approaching very closely
 indeed to the theoretical power of that fuel, are largely due to the fact that the
 air and lic[uid can be injected in definite and regular proportions, insuring perfect

combustion.

    Again, in the use of powdered fuel bj' Mr. Crampton, where the powder is blown
 into the furnace by the very air which is there to enter into combustion with it,
 ver)' high evaporative results have been reached even under tlie disadvantageous
 circumstances attendant upon earlj' experiments ; and this also I believe to be due
 to the power of accurately adjusting the quantity of air to the fuel to be burnt.

    The same power of adjustment may be obtained in those instances where the

 fuel is previously converted into gas, as practised by Mr. Siemens ; and nearly
 similar control can be got with ordinary fuel by reverting to some of those systems
 of mechanical fire-feeding which were in use from twenty-five to thirty years ago,
 but which have been to a great extent abandoned in consequence of the more
 general adoption of internal fires and high-pressure boilers. The fires of such
 boilers are in furnaces of small diameters, which do not admit of the introduction of
 the apparatus, for which room was readily found below the bottoms of the waggon-
 shaped boilers fornrerly used for low-pressure steam. Qther modes of fire-feeding,

 however, have been devised, and have come, to a certain extent, into use. It is

not the object of tliis address to enter into tlie details of such matters as these. I

will therefore content myself by saying I am perfectly certain there is hardly any

subject more worthy the attention of the engineer than the replacing the stoker by

some mechanical arrangement which shall alibrd absolute uniformity of firing, and

therefore absolute uniformity of the conditions of the fire; and this is a subject

not only worthy of attention on account of the saving of coal, but also on llic

ground of putting an end to a most laborious, exhausting, and, it is to l)e feared,

unhealthy occupation--viz. that of the steamboat fireman, more particula.rlj' wheu

he is worlving in a hot climate. If perfect combustion were obtained in the fire, I

do not think there would be much difficulty in properly utilizing by the boiler the

heat evolved. All that is necessary' to attain this end is to give a sufficient amount

of surface to absorb the heat and to transmit it to the water, always bearing in

mind that, above all, the form of the boiler should be a safe one, that there should

be proper water-space within it and an adequate water-surface from which the

steam could escape, that it might do so with tranquillity, and so as not to give rise

to the spray technically known as " priming," and that all parts of the boiler

should be accessible for cleaning.

  I am aware there is a temptation, on the score of saving expense and of saving

room, to make the boiler of small size in relation to the amount of coals burnt under

--it and to the quantity of steam required from it ; but this is a most extravagant

economy, it is a saving in the outset, but it is a perpetual soiu'ca of loss in the

working. Temperatm-es as high as 800 and even 1000 degi-ees of heat have been

known to exist among the products of combustion escaping from the boiler. Now

when it is recollected that every 100 degrees of heat in the outgoing products of

combustion represents 2^ per cent, of the whole heating-power of the coal, even if

only the minimum amount of air to ensure perfect combustion is admitted, it AviU
be seen how necessary it is that there should be sufficient surface in the boiler to

absorb the heat of the gases, and to bring them down to a few degrees above the

temperature of the water in the boiler itself. I have mentioned the temptation to

use boilers of inadequate size on the score of expense and on the score of room. It

is this latter reason, no doubt, which induces shipowners to endeavour to diminish

the size of their boilers as far as practicable, because they argue that the space

occupied by the boilers and machinery is all waste room, as it cannot be filled

either with coals or with cargo. With short-voyage steamers, voyages of a few
hours only, this argument may be a valid one ; but for the long-voyage vessels to

India and elsewhere, where fuel has to be carried for from twenty to thirty days'
steaming, and where on the homeward voyage the ships have to be supplied with

coal that has been brought from England by sailing-vessel at a large cost for

freight, the true space deducted from the cargo and passenger-carrying power of

the steamship is clearly not that occupied by the engines and boilers alone, but

that occupied by the engines, the boiler, and the coal for those boilers. Even sup-

posing that if, after enlarging the boilers to diminish the consumption, the space to
be given up to the engine, boilers, and coal were still the same, in consequence of

the increase in the size of the boilers being equivalent to the coal-space saved,

manifestly it would be to the advantage of the shipowner that that space should

be occupied by the boilers rather than by the coals.

The expense of the boilers is a first outlay, and has not to be repeated for years

until the boilers wear out ; but the expense of coal is an outlay that has to be
made at eveiy voyage, and therefore it is a short-sighted policy to restrict the
amount of absorbing surface in a boiler on the plea that a boiler with full surface

takes up a greater space in the ship, if by doing away with such restriction a

saving can be effected in the fuel.

The beneficial results which are attained by the greater size of boiler in relation

to the coal burnt and to the horse-power required can be shown not onlv by cal-

culation, but by example. In Her Majesty's ship ' Briton,' fitted with extremely eco-

nomic compound engines of Mr. E. A. Cowper's design, close upon two pounds per

horse-power per hour were  burnt when  the  ship was  making thirteen  knots                              but
                                                                                                       ;

on being worked at ten knots the consumption fell to 1 ^^^ lb, of coal for the lesser

horse-power then used.

I will now say a few words upon the engines.
236 ttEPOKT--1872.

   The locomotive eugiue lias for many yeavs past beiug doing very fair duty. Tliis

lias arisen, I believe, first, from, the fact tliat since the introduction of coal the
furnaces have been to a considerable extent gas-furuaces with a free admission of
air through open fire-doors to the surface of the fuel.

   Second, from the fact that the boilers have large absorbing surfaces. From
these causes as much as 9 or 10 lbs. of cold water are commonly evaporated per lb.

of coal, while the engines working with high steam and considerable expansion
make a good use of that steam.

   In Marine Engineering there has within the last ten years been an enormous
improvement. The old-fashioned engine working at 20 lbs. steam, and with injec-
tion-condensers, is being abandoned for engines generally on the compound-cjdinder
principle, working at GO and 70 lbs. steam [highly expansive, and fitted with sur-
face-condensers. The result is a reduction of the consumption of fuel in the same
vessels on the same voyages, and performed in the same time, of from 40 to 50 per
cent, of that which was previously burnt ; but I believe that a large field for im-
provement in marine engines still remains, especially iu the firing and in the size

of the boiler.

   Among the best instances of what can be done iu the way of economy may be

mentioned the rapidly increasing class of portable agricultural engines.
   These engines, like the locomotive, are, from their migratory condition, incapable

of being fitted with condensers, and thus must be worked as non-condensing"

--engines, exhausting their waste steam into the air a most serious disadvantage.

Nevertheless such great advances have been made by the unremitting attention of
the extremely skilful mechanical engineers who construct these engines, that at the
late Cardiff" Meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society of England one of the
engines (the prize engine, that of Messrs. Clayton and Shuttleworth) ran for five
hours and one minute with 14 lbs. of coal per horse-power, being therefore a little
under 2 lbs. of coal per horse-power per hour; and this was the horse-power

                               ,*u^

of the dynamometer break, and not the mere indicated horse-power by which
marine engines and other engines are ordinarily judged. The indicated horse-
power is, of course, in excess of that developed upon the break, as the indicated
power includes all the engine-friction and break-friction and if this latter horse-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

power be taken as a standard, the best of tlie engines tried by the Koyal Agricul-
tural Society this j'ear at Oarditt' will offer favourable comparison with even very
good condensing-engines, and will be found to give a duty far beyond that which
ten years ago would have been thought obtainable in any but the very best.

   It may be mentioned that the Cornish pumping-engines, which used to be looked

upon as the most economic of all engines, are, according to the Juno monthly
report, doing onlj' an average duty of 53 Jg- miUious of lbs. lifted 1 foot high for
1 cwt. of coals, and that the very best of them is doing only 71f ,, millions of lbs.,

while the break horse-power developed by Messrs. Clayton & Shuttleworth's

engine, at Cardiff", gave a duty of 79^-^ millions of lbs. This large duty was due
to the great ability in the management of the fire (as has already been hinted at)
and to the proper proportion of the boiler in obtaining the steam, and to its thorough
cleaning in preserving it in the first instance, and tlien to the efficient utilization
of that steam by high expansion in a cylinder steam-jacketed around its circum-
ference and at the ends. But at the very same show there competed for the prize
an engine which, to the eye of the uninstructed (the ordinary purchaser for example),
was as likely an engine as the prize engine ; and yet this engine burnt 10 lbs. of
coal per horse-power per hour, or nearly four times that which was burnt by the prize
engine ; and, moreover, it must bo remembered that this wasteful engine was one

which the maker thought worthy to be sent to trial. How many are there, there-

fore, among those which makers do not think worthy to be sent to trial, which
must deal as wastefuUy or more wastefully with coal, and are, for the sake of a
few pounds in the first cost, bought by ignorant purchasers, who go on committing
the sin of wasting coals with such engines until they are worn out, the loss
becoming greater with the age of the engine.

  It may be said that hitherto my observations upon consumption in steam-
engines have contained quite as much of praise as of blame, and I am glad to say

that it has been so ; but it will be foimd that these praises have referred to the

engines of railways, wliicli are under the especial charge of educated liieclianical

engineers, who carefully watch and tabulate all their results, and who have funds

--at their disposal for the purchase and maintenance of good engines that they

referred to the recent improvement in marine engines, which engines, being as a
whole in the hands either of powerful companies or of large capitalists, enjoy the

--advantages of due outlay and of proper superintendence and that they referred to

the prize engines and to the better competitive engines of the portable class, while

admitting the existence of a large number of such engines which were most wasteful
of fuel. But there remains the great class of fixed engines used for driving manu-
factories, which engines are, as a rule, of the most disgraceful and scandalous

character. In the first place, enormous numbers of them are non-condensing

engines                                      as an excuse  for  this it is in many instances alleged  that water  is  scarce
                                          :

and that there is not, therefore, the means of providing condensation. To meet

such excuses it should be remembered there are appliances well known to scientific

engineers (at all events that have been in use for many years) by which conden-

sation can be effected with no more water than is required for the feed of a high-

pressure engine. I allude to the ordinary cooling ponds for injection-water, and

to the surface-evaporation condenser. In every instance these may be employed

and thus, in lieu of sending steam into the atmosphere at a pound or two above

atmospheric pressure, that steam might be condensed, and a pressure of 12 or

13 lbs. additional throughout the whole stroke of the piston miglit be obtained

moreover the interior of the boiler would be kept clean, and thus its surfiice would

be in the best state for transmitting heat.

   But passing by this question of the repugnance to the use of condensing engines,

and admitting, for the sake of argument, that non-condensing engines may bo
allowed, what does one ordinarily find as a type of the non-condensing engine ?
One finds the cylinder with a cubic capacity far too great for the work required

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

where steam is used throughout the stroke, one finds that this capacity is not

utilized as it might be by the employment of high-pressure steam and considerable

expansion, and that while the steam, even in the boiler, is probably at only 40 lbs.

above atmosphere, the governor is flying out nearly to the full width, the throttle-
valve is all but closed, and there is a continuous " wire drawing " of the steam, so

that its average pressure throughout the stroke of the cylinder is only some 15 or

20 lbs. above atmosphere. Now when one recollects that it requires one portion

of coal to get steam up to atmospheric pressure, and that this portion may be

looked upon as practically constant, whatever pressure of steam above atmosphere

may afterwards be attained, and that if, therefore, steam at 15 lbs. above atmosphere

be used, half of all the fuel is lost, while if at 30 lbs. above atmosphere, 5 only is

lost, and if at 120 lbs. above atmosphere, only will be lost in getting up steam to
                                                                                                                                                                          J-

atmospheric pressure, one can imderstand how essential it is that in non-condensing

engines the steam should be used at a really high pressure ; and yet, as I have said,
I believe that if the large number of 10- or 20-horse horizontal non-condensing

engines employed by manufacturers throughout the kingdom were examined, and

indicator diagrams were taken, it would be found that their pressure upon the

{listens did not average much more than 20 lbs. above atmosphere : and it is a

--amentable fact that many makers of steam-engines men who cannot be properly

called engineers ; men who are mere manufiictm-ers, not knowing the principles of

--the art they follow will boast that their engine is doing very well; it drives the

wliole of Mr. So-and-so's work and does not require more than 30 lbs. steam in the

boiler, not understanding that if they would raise that steam to 120 lbs., and then

work it uon-expansively in a small cylinder, they would thereby be obtaining a

great economy, and if they would work it expansively in a large cj'linder, that

cylinder being properly steam -jaclieted, they would obtain a still greater economy.

   I have now laid before you some of the points in which the boilers and engines

of the present day are below the standard to which engineering science has already
reached, and in which, therefore, there is known opportunity for immediate

improvement.

   1 think there is so little reliable information as to the total horse-power at work
in the United Kingdom (as is evidenced by the fact that very recently the number
of boilers has been estimated before a Parliamentarv Committee as low as 50,000,

1872.                                                                                                 17

and as liigli as doutle and even close upon quadruple that number), that I feel it
would be an unwarrantable waste of the time ot the Section if I were to invite

them to follow me into calculations, or rather siDecidations, as to the exact
savino- that would be made in the consumption of coal consequent upon improving
the whole of our steam-engines up to the present highest standard. It will, how-
ever, be quite sufficient, to show the importance of the question, for me to say
(and I am sure I should be perfectly safe in saying) that such saving would have

to be estimated by millions of tons.
   Such a saving, as I have said, is one that might be made with our present know-

ledge ; but when we recollect that an engine burning even as little as 2 lbs. of coal

per indicated horse-power per hour is still developing only one tenth of all the

power which, according to calculation, resides in that coal, there is manifestly a

vast scope for our mechanical engineers in the exercise of their talents for producing

further economy.

   But let not users of coal remain indifferent to savings on their present consump-
tion until those improvements are discovered by scientific men ; on the contrary,

let them forthwith do every thing in their power to reduce the consumption

to the extent to which present science and, in some instances, present practice

show the consumption can be reduced. One is apt, at first sight, to marvel that

--owners of steam-engines should be so blind to their own interest, and should permit

waste to go on day after day and j-ear after year a waste not only prejudicial to

the community at large and to succeeding generations, but a waste causing constant

expense to those who commit it, and a waste, therefore, that one would think such

persons woidd only be too ready to stop but the fact is, there are several reasons
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

why manufacturers and others permit the waste to go on.

In prosperous times those engaged in manufactures are too busy earning and

saving money to attend to a reorganization of their plant ; in bad times they are
too dispirited and too little inclined to spend the money that in better times they

have saved in replacing old and wasteful appliances by new and economical ones

and one feels that there is a very considerable amount of seeming justification for

their conduct in both instances, and that it requires a really comprehensive and

large intelligence and a belief in the future, possessed by only a few out of the bulk

of mankind, to cause the manufacturer to pursue that which would be the true

policy as well for his own interests as for those of the community. But there

is a furth.er and a perpetual bugbear in the way of such improvements, and that

bugbear is the so-called " practical man ;" and he was in my mind when, in pre-

vious parts of this address, I have hinted at the existence of an obstacle to the

adoption of improvement.

   I do not wish the Section for one moment to suppose that I, brought up as an

apprentice in a workshop, and who all my life have practised my profession, intend

to say one word against the tnily practical man. On the contrary, he is the man

--of all others that I admire, and by whom I would wish persons to be guided because

the tridy practical man is one who knows the reason of that which he practises,

who can give an account of the faith that is in him, and who, while he possesses

the readiness of mind and the dexterity which arise from the long-continued and

dailj' intercourse with the subject of his profession, possesses also that necessary

amount of theoretical and scientific knowledge which justifies him in pursuing any

process he adopts, which in many cases enables him to devise new processes, or

which, at all events, if he be not of an inventive qualitj' of mind, will enable him

to appreciate and value the new processes devised by others. This is the truly

practical man, about whom I have nothing to say except that which is most lauda-

tory                     but  the  practical  man  as  commonly understood  means  a  man  who  knows
                      ;
--the practice of his trade and knows nothing else concerning it the man whose

wisdom consists in standing by seeing, but not investigating, the new discoveries

which are taking place around him, in decrying those discoveries, in applying 1o

those who invent improvements, even the very greatest, the epithet of "schemers,"

and then, when he finds that, beyond all dispute, some new matter is good and has

come into general practice, taking to it grumblingiy, but still taking to it, because

if he did not he could not compete with his co-manufacturers, the aim and object

of such a man being to ensure that he should never malce a mistake by embarking

his capital or liis time in that which has not been proved by men of large hearts

r.nd large intelligence.

It is snch a practical man as this who delays all improvement. For years he

delayed the development in England of the utilization of the waste gases of blast-

furnaces                                         and he has done  so so successfully that, as I have  already had occasion to
                                              ;

roniark, that utilization is by no means universal in this kingdom. It was such

men as these who kept back surface- condensation for twenty years.

   It is such a man as tliis who, when semaphores were invented, would have said,
" Don't suggest such a mode to me of transmitting messages: I am a practical man.

Sir ; and I believe that the way to transmit a message is to write it on paper, deliver

it to a. messenger, and put him on horseback."

   In the next generation his successor would be a believer in semaphores ; and when
the electrical telegraphist came to him and said, " Do you know that I can transmit

movement by invisible electrical power through a wire however long ? and it seems
to me that, if one were to make a code out of these movements, I could speak to you

at Portsmouth at one end of the wire while I was in London at the other," what

would have been the answer of the practical man ? " Sir, I don't believe in trans-
mitting messages by an invisible agency ; I am a practical man, and I believe in

semaphores, which I can see working."

   In like manner, when the Siemens's Regenerative Gas-Furnace was introduced,
what said the practical man ? " Turn your coals into gas, and burn the gas, and

then talk of regeneration ! I don't know what you mean by regeneration, except in
a spiritual sense ; I am a practical man, and if I want heat out of coals I put coals

on to a fire and burn them:" and for fifteen years the practical man has been the

bar to this most valuable improvement in metallurgical operations.

The practical man is beginning slowly to yield with respect to these furnaces,

because he finds, as I have already said, that men of gieater intelligence have now

in sufficiently large numbers adopted the invention to make a formidable competi-

tion with the persons who stolidlj' refuse to be improved.

   The same practical man for years stood in the way of the development of Bes-

semer steel. Now he has been compelled to become a convert.

I will not weary you by citing more instances ; but one knows, and one's expe-

rience teaches him, that this is the conduct of the so-called practical man ; and this

conduct arises not only from the cause which I have given (his ignorance of the

principles), but also from another cause (one which I have had occasion to allude

to when speaking upon a difierent subject), and that is, you cfl'end his pride when

3'ou come to him and say, " Adopt such a plan ; it is an improvement on the process

--von carry on." His instinct revolts at the notion that you a stranger, very likely

his junior, and very probably, if the improvement be an original and radical one, a

person not even connected with the trade to which that improvement relates

should dare to tell him that you can inform him of something connected with his

business that he did not know.

It may be said that employers and the heads of manufactories are, as a rule, in

these days, educated gentlemen, and that, therefore, it is wrong to impute to them

tlie nanowmindedness of the practical man. I agree that in numerous instances

this would be wrong ; but the fact is, that in many cases (I think I may say in most
ca?es) the head of the establishment, the monied man, the man who by his com-

mercial ability (that most necessary element in all establishments) keeps the con-

cern going by finding lucrative orders, is not intimfitely acquainted with the practice

of the business carried on by his firm : he relies upon some manager or foreman,

who too commonly is not the real but the so-called practical man. It is such men

as those who simplj' practice that which they have seen, without knowing why they

practice it ; to them the title of practical man has most improperly been attributed";
and it is on the advice of such men that the true heads of the firm too commonly

regulate their conduct as to the management of their business, and as to the neces-

sary changes to be made in the way of improvement.

   As I have said, the practical man derides those who bring forward new inven-
tions, and calls tliem schemers. No doubt whatever, they do scheme ; and well it is

gress of art and manufacture has depended, and will depend, upon successful dis-
coveries which in their inception were, and will be schemes, just as much as were

those discoveries that have been, and will be, unfruitfid ; but the successful dis-

coveries, because they are successful, are taken out of the category of schemes

wheu years of untiring application on the part of the inventors have, so to speak,

thrust them down the throat of the unwilling practical man. Take the instance of
Mr. Bessemer, who was beset for years by diiiiculties of detail in his great
scheme of improvement in the manufacture of steel. As long as he was so beset,
the practical men chorused, "he is a schemer; he is one of the schemers; it is a

scheme."

Supposing that these practical difficulties had beaten Mr. Bessemer, and that they

had not been overcome to this day, the practical man would have derided him still

as a schemer, although the theory and groundwork of his invention would have been

as true uuder these circumstances as it now is. Fortunately for the world, and

happily for him, he was able to overcome these most vexatious hindrances, and

make his invention that which it is. No one now dares to apply the term " schemer"

to Mr.  Bessemer,  or " scheme"  to his invention                                                                           but it  is as true now  that he is a
                                                                                                                         ;

" schemer," and his invention a " scheme," as it would have been had he failed up to

the present to conc[uer the minor difficulties. It is a species of profanation to sug-

gest, but I must suggest it, for it is true, that Watt, Stephenson, Faradav, and

almost every other name among the honoured dead to whose inventive genius we

owe the development that has taken place within the last century in all the luxuries,

the comforts, even the bare necessities, of our daily existence, would in their day,

and while struggling for success, have been spoken of as schemers, even in respect

of those very inventions of which we are now euj oying the fruits. I3ut I feel I need

--not labour this point further at a Meeting of the Mechanical Section of the British

Association, an Association established for the Advancement of Science.
   I know 1 shall be accused of decrving the practical man, and of upholding the

" schemers." I say most emphatically that I do not decry the practical man. I

plead guilty to the charge of decrying the miscalled practical man, and I glory iu

my guilt, while I readily accept that which I consider the praise of upholding

''schemers;" and I do so for this simple reason, that if there were no schemers

there would be no improvement.

I think it becomes a scientific bod}' like the British Association to laud tlie

generous effi)rts of the unsuccessful inventor, rather than to encourage the cold sel-

fishness of the man who stands by and sees others endeavour to raise the structure

of improvement without lending a hand to help, and even sneers at the builders,
but when the structure is fully raised and solidly established, claims to come in to

inhabit, and, being in, probably essays, cuckoo-hke, to oust the builders and to take

possession for his own benefit.

   One word in conclusion. Can we not devise some means by which consumers of
coal may be instructed in, shamed into, or tempted to the economical use of that

most valuable material ?

   The Royal Agricultural Society of England, by its judicious efforts for many

years past, by the institution of trials and the giving of prizes for the best engines,
has brought the consumption of coal down from 10 lbs. per horse-power to a little
over one quarter of that quantity.

   Could we not institute a society which should devote itself to the recording

and the rewarding of the performances of steamboats, and of fixed engines for land-

purposes ?

  1 am aware it is supposed there is a difficulty in these cases which does not ob-

tain in the case of portable engines that can be brought for trial upon a d;sTiamo-
meter, and that is that the power exerted by marine engines varies during the
voyage, and is not that which is developed at the measured mile ; while in a manu-

factory it varies according to the conditions of the trade, and to the extent to which
the British workman condescends to attend to his work.

   But there are implements which record the horse-power exerted from moment
to monient, and register it on indices as readable as those of an ordinary counter of

an engine, or as those of a gas-meter.

. I believe that one of the very greatest incentives to economical working which
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS,  241

the owners of steamboats could oiler to tlieir engine-lauilders and engineers would
be the application of such implements as these. Were they employed, the ship-
owner would know at the end of the voyage so much horse-power had been exerted
as a whole, that so much coal had been burned, and that the result, therefore, was
a consumption of so many pounds per horse-power per hour. All the eli'ects of head-
winds in retardation, and all the aid of canvas to the engine-power, would be elimi-
nated ti-om the calculation. The continual indicator would register truly the work
the engine had to do, whether that work was made excessive by contending with
head-winds, or was rendered light by favourable breezes and the assistance of can'\as.

In the same way the proprietor of the engine for manufacturing-purposes, the cotton-

mill, the woollen-miil, the corn-mill, and even the highly irregularly working roUing-

--mills and saw-mills, would be able at the end of the quarter to say "Notwith-

standing all the N'aiiations of my trade and rate of manufacture, I know that my

engines have exerted so much power ; I know that 1 have burned so much coal, and
that, therefore, such and such have been the economic results." Assuming that

steamboat proprietors and the owners of fixed land-engines would go to the expense

of applying such continuous recording implements as these to their engines, and
would become members of an association for the purpose of visiting and inspecting

and of reporting upon their machinery, and of giving prizes to the men in charge

for careful attention, prizes to the manufacturers for original good design and work-
manship of the engines, and prizes to theproprietorsfor their public spirit in having
bought that which was good instead of that which was bad and cheap, and fo
having employed intelligent and careful workmen instead of ignorant and careless
ones, I believe, within a few years, as great an improvement might be seen among

the marine and manufactining class of engines as has been eftected by the laudable
exertions of the Royal Agricultural Society of England among the portable ones.

   I think the initiation of some such society as this would be a practically useful
result from the meeting of Section " G."

   It now only remains for me to thank you most sincerely for the patience with

which you have listened to an address that, as regards length, has exceeded the

excuse is, that the subject of economy in the use of coal is in itself so highly im-

portant to every member of the community that I felt it warranted me iu detaining

     Ea^picl and Economical Transjport of Merchandise. By C. Beegeeon.

   The author proposes to pack the materials for transport in iron spheres of 4 feet
to 6 or 7 feet diameter, and to provide a concave roadway of sheet-steel resting on
sleepers, or, where necessary for crossing valleys, suspended from pillars or piers,
on the principle of the suspension-bridge, down which these loaded spheres may
roll by their own gravity, the empty spheres being brought back in tubes, on

the principle of the pneumatic despatch.

                     On Aerial Naviyation. By C. A. Bowdlee.

   The author thought the autumn manoeuvres would be an excellent opportunity
for trying experiments, and that aerostation would become an important element in
military science. Hitherto captive balloons only had been used ; but it was by no
means improbable that circumstances would occur where it would be most desirable
to pass over the enemy's position, and it would then be important to have the
power of deflecting the balloon from the wind course, either to the right or to the
left, as required. Captive balloons could not be used in safety in high winds, on
account of violent rocking of the car. The writer then proceeded to reA'iew the

principles of aerostation, and to stow that aerial navij2;ation was practicable only to
a certain limit by simple mechanical means. Of the practicability of applying

steam-power he had no hope, the weight of a steam-engine made as light as
possible, consistent with due strength, being much too great for any gas balloon to

support. The power he proposed was manual, being, he believed, the only power

applicable to gas balloons. But propulsion having been secured, the question

arose how the power of direction could be acquired, that being of the utmost

importance in actual warfare. That was accomplished by rotating the balloon to

any required position, and then, holding it from further motion, tlie rotation was

Acompletely under the control of the aeronaut.  rudder was the instrument to be

used for that pm-pose, a vertical disk fixed in a line with the axis of the propeller.

By turning tlie plane of the disk, the current of air forced from the fan on the

rudder caused the whole machine to rotate right or left, precisely as the rudder of

a ship guided the vessel,

measures for its extension. The main line will be from Hungary through Servia to

Filibeh (Philipopoli), and Edreneh (Adrianople) to Constantinople.

   On account of political difficulties raised by the Serviau administration, the

works have been carried on at other points; but the Servian junction having been

arranged operations will be begun there. The works now in progress are from
Filibeh to Constantinople, with branches from Uskup to Salonika and the
Mediterranean, and from Edreneh to Dedeh Aghaj on the same sea. The portions
open or ready for opening are :--

Edreneh to Ilarmanli                            40 miles.

The Constantinople terminus is ready.

   Only 25 miles will at the end of the year remain uncompleted between Constan-

tinople and Edi-eneh.

  A connexion is proposed between Edreneh and the Varna and Euschuk railway,

which has a circuitous connexion with the Austro-IIungarian and Russian railways.
   The Salonilca branch is proposed as a steam-boat station for Smyrna, Skanderven,

and the Euphrates valley and Alexandria,

   No measures are talcen for passing tLe Bosphorus at Constantinople except by

steam-boat.

0)1 certain Economical Improvements in the Construction of Locomotive
   Engines, hi/ the addition of Mechanical Appliances for the use of Heated Air

  in combination with Stei^m, on the principle invented hy G-eorge Warsop. By

   lliCHARD Eaton.

This paper is supplementary to those read by the same author at Exeter and

Liverpool, and gives the details of ably conducted and exhaustive experiments
made on a locomotive, the property of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway

Company, in regular worlc, mainly as a goods engine, but occasionally doing pas-
senger-train duty in the Liverpool district. The use of the heated-air injection

was found to detach old scale, of considerable thickness, from the boiler in all

parts, and to prevent the formation of new, thus diminishing the item of " cost of

Amaintenance, and prolonging the life of boilers, tubes, and fire-boxes.  great

economy of fuel was also demonstrated, averaging frequently 30 per cent. The

air-system was found to work in harmony with the injectors, and of great

mservice at critical moments, such as when an engine, caught a snow-storm, with

a heavy load to draw up an incline, reciuires every aid to its motive power that

mechanical science can give. Less coal being consumed, the atmosphere in tunnels

will be purer.

       On Marine Propulsion*. By W. E. Eckakt (late of U.S. Navy)

   This paper contained an account of the construction and machinery of a steam
launch fitted with delicate dynamometric apparatus for testing its resistance at

various speeds. It was constructed at the Navy Yard, Mare Island, California,
and a very great number of careful experiments were made to determine the
resistance both of the boat and of the engines. The paper was illustrated by

tables and engravings.

   t Mr. Froude in the discussion mentioned that, although the apparatus be had described
was wholly his o^ni invention, he had since found that a French naval architect had con-
trived an instrument substantially the same a few years ago, having in the first instance
made the penduhim-apparatus, and then added an apparatus for observing the horizon

such as he had first described. Ho had been in correspondence with this gentleman, and it

gave him great pleasure to find that in an invention of wliich lie liad thought himself the
originator lie had been preceded by two or three years by a very able man. It was,
however, a satisfaction to him that he was at the present time ahead of his friendly com-
petitor in the race so far as regarded the delicately hung heavy fly-wheel wliich was to
fmnish an automatic constant record of the angles of absolute rolling, or deviations from
the horizontal, assumed at each moment by the ship.

centre of gravity, will hang at rest if it occupy the normal position, and if it have

a very short period of oscillation it will instantly assume that position throughout

the changes of the wave-slope. The apparatus in question might be tlius described.

A revolving cylinder covered with paper and turned by rough clockwork received

the marks made by several pens. One of these pens recorded time, jerks being

given it at successive equal intervals by an exact clock. The apparatus being

placed at the centre of gravity of the ship, a pendulum of very short period and

considerable power, oscillating in the plane transversely with the keel, recorded

continuously by a second pen the angles which the ship at eacl? moment made

with the mean or effective surface of the wave. Another pen actuated by a

rocking-arm kept level by an observer on deck, wlio pointed it to the horizon,

recorded  the  angle the  ship  made with the horizon                                                                                           and from the     record thus

obtained the amount of the roll of the ship with regard to the wave-slope was at

once shown : the form of the wave, too, could be easih' worked out graphically, the

wave-slope at each moment being simply the difterence between the records pro-

duced by the pendulum-pen and the horizon-pen respectively. But the gi-aphic

integration of the results supplied by the pendulum-pen, if correctlj' performed,

supplied what might be called the theoretical measure of the oscillations which

the ship ought to have performed with regard to the horizon during the period

embraced in the record ; for the pendulum record itself supplies throughout a

measure   of the accelerating force  by which the  ship's                                                                                       oscillation  is  governed                                               so
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

that the integration of this gives a diagram representing the angular velocity which

the ship should theoretically have acquired under the operation of that force

and the integration of the velocity diagram in turn gives the sequence or total of

motions which the varying velocitj' involves. The performance of these integra-

tions involves, indeed, a con-ect knowledge of the ship's dynamic constants ; but

these, so far as they are not already known by calculation, may be readily

obtained by a single experiment with the ship in still water, where, if she be

artificially brought into oscillation (an operation easily performed), and the instru-

ment be made to record the oscillations as they subside under the iniluence of

resistance, the natural period of her oscillation is at once known, and the coefficient

of resistance is deducible in a shape which is approximately applicable to the ship's

seaway oscillation. All the conditions required for the integration are thus

supplied. Several series of diagrams thus obtained by the oscillation of ships

in a seaway had been thus integrated, and the theoretical oscillations accorded

with the recorded oscillations, so that the fundamental elements of the theory of

rolling had been most satisfactorily veiified. An apparatus had also been com-

pleted consisting of a heavj' stationary wheel, which was so delicately supported as

to be incapable of receiving any rotation from the motion of a ship. ' This wheel, if

placed transversely in the ship, would remain quite undisturbed while she rolled,
and would thus supply the place of the horizontal bar above described, held

level by the observer on deck. The wheel was 3 ft. in diameter and 200 lb. in
weight. Through the boss was carried out a strong steel axis, the prolonged ends

of which were coated with hardened steel. The axis thus prolonged rested

between two pairs of rocking-arms, the ends of each pair fomiing a kind of V- The

ends of the aims were, in fact, hardened steel plates, fonning segments of circles

struck from the axes or centres on which the arms rocked, so that they were

virtually portions of the circumferences of very large friction-rollers. In order still

further to reduce the friction of the working parts, the axes of the rocking-arnis

were finally reduced to hardened steel pins of small diameter, and so mounted that
their motions when of small range should be rolling not sliding motions, and great
delicacy was thus obtained. The centre of gTavity was brought to within OC0(].5 in.

of the axis of suspension, and the time of a single swing was over thirty-five

seconds : yet £o great was the delicacy of the guspension, that a weight of aioVoir part

oscillation of Ijin. in range, and which would continue for many minutes ; or if
the -wheel -were moved 90 degi-ees from its position of rest, the oscillations -would
continue for nearly twenty minutes, the movement being so slo-w and solemn as to
impress on the mind of an observer -who had not seen it put in motion that the
action -was self-orig-inated or induced b}' some mysterious agency. The oscillation

of a ship could not put such a -wheel in motion; or rather, if an infinitesimal
motion were produced, this would be of so long a period that its effects would be
easily separable from those proper to the oscillation of the ship. Thus the
indications would be more exact than those produced by the rocking-arm on deck.

The apparatus last described on deck had not yet been tried, and was awaiting a

good rough day at Plymouth.

The Brigliton Intercepting and Outfall Seivers. By John G. Gamble, B.A.

Plitherto the sewage of Brighton has been partly received by cesspools, partly

carried by various outfalls direct into the sea. The cesspools are being gradually

abolished ; but although nearly all the present outfalls now discliarge under the

sea beyond low-water mark, yet the nuisance to bathers and to people in boats is

considerable. The intercepting sewer designed by Mr. Hawkshaw, C.E., and at

present in course of construction, will intercept all the existing outfalls, and will

cany the sewage away to the eastward four miles from the nearest point of

Brighton, where it may either be discharged into the sea or utilized. Float experi-

ments undertaken olf Portobello prove that no nuisance can possibly be caused to

Brighton.

The sewer is of circular section throughout, being of 5 feet internal diameter for

nearly t-wo miles, and 7 feet internal diameter for more than seven miles. The fall

is 3 feet per mile.

At some to-wns the sewers are required to act as land-drains as well as sewage-

carriers. This very objectionable plan is not necessary at Brighton, as the land

water sinks down into the chalk, and comes out on the shore at low tide without

troubling the basements of the houses. The sewer has, on the contrary, to be made

especially water-tight, so as to resist the percolation from the porous strata without

as well as any leakage from within. The storage capacity is such that if the whole of

twelve hours' flow were penned up in the sewer it would not reach within a mile

of the east end of Brighton, and any gases generated would pass up ventilating-

Ashafts more than a mile from the town.  stomr overflow and a flushing inlet

will be provided. The great difficulty in managing sewers is to keep them clear of

the road-sweepings, which get past the gulleys, form a solid deposit in the sewer,

and collect other and more noxious materials upon them. In sewers of short

length flushing by water is the best method of getting rid of such deposit ; but in

the case of a sewer more than seven miles long the expense of flushing the deposit

forward and forward to the outfall, as well as the damage thereby done to the brick-

lining, would be so great that probably the greater part of the solid materials will have

to be removed by hand at the various entrances. To assist this, catch-tanks will be

placed at all junctions, to stop as much as possible of the road-drift, flints, &c. that

would otherwise get into the sewer. Wherever possible road-gulleys ought not

to discharge into the sewers ; in the front of Brighton they might, and some do,

discharge on to the beach. No objection could be made to this if a good sj'steni

of scavenging for horse-droppings were in operation. Yentilating-shafts are placed

at intervals ; they are covered by cast-iron grates made in two portions, one
fltting inside the other. This is important, as a man or boy can remove the inner

casting without disturbing the road metalling. He can thus get into the catch-

pit with which all these shafts are provided, and clear out anj' road-sweepings that

may have fallen through the grating. Charcoal baskets are not used, as it has

been proved that they check the current of air. Charcoal will no doubt purify

air that is forced through it, but it is only in winter when the sewer air is warmer

than the air without that any great current is created. Besides, the air inside

being generally cooler and therefore heavier, sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic

acid gas, two of the sewer gases, are both heavier than air j hence the only escape ie

in consequence of the property gases have of diffusion. In order to create a draught,
Archimediau screws worked by the wind above have been tried, but ventilation is

most required when the air is cakii. Fans worked by the current of water below
might be used, but the worst smells are given off when the current is least.
Burning the gases has been suggested ; but earburetted hydrogen, one of the sewer

gases, is highly inflammable, and coal-gas has been found to escape from the gas-
mains into the sewers. Explosions might result ; and, in fact, an explosion did

result from an experiment tried by Mr. H. Austin, O.E. The same argument may

be employed against the proposal to create a draught by jets of coal-gas in the

shafts.

   The situation of the outfall is especially suited for sewage-irrigation, and the suh-

                  By Alexander M^Calltjm Gordon, of Liverpool.

   This paper served to introduce a comparatively new description of piping called

Haines's Lead-encased Block-tin Piping, and pointed out the advantages it offered

over ordinary lead pipe as a medium for the conveyance of water throughout

dwellings.

   This piping consists of two distinct tubes, an outer one of lead suiTOunding or
encasing an inner one of pure tin, both being united at their surfaces of contact as
to form a perfectly homogeneous body, and thus offering the admirable physical
qualities of a lead pipe together with absolute freedom from the danger of lead-
poisoning by reason of the innocuous nature of the tin composing the inner pipe.

   The lead-encased tin pipe was shown to be no more expensive than leaden pipe,
as the extra strength gained by the superior tenacitj' of the tin, and certain condi-
tions which operate in its manufacture, allows of a diminution of the weight per
lineal measurement for a given pressui'e. The piping had already been adopted in
many public institutions and private mansions throughout the kingdom, and when
better known is likely to take the place of the dangerously poisonous lead pipe
now so universally in use.

These consist of an endless wire rope travelling over horizontal drums, one at

each extremity of the distance to be traversed, supported and running over pulleys

fixed on posts or piers at intervals. The buckets for holding the minerals or other

goods for transport are suspended on the rope and travel with it, in such a

manner as readily to pass over the pulleys and avoid contact with the posts. It

appears well adapted for the transport of goods, and especially minerals, in districts

Awhere roads or ordinary tramways are not available.  working model of the

wire tramway was shown at the conclusion of the meeting to the members of the

definite estimate of the " rougliness of tlie sea," at present recorded for meteoro-

logical purposes at a very coarse guess from mere inspection. He considered

--it was desirable to confine tiie measurement to two points ascertaining the

aggregate heiglit of the waves, and their number during measured intervals of

time ; and he had devised simple -and compact machinery for this purjjose, as well

as for obtaining profiles of waves when desired. The machinery could consist of a

float sliding up and down strained wires on a platform like Brighton or Scarborough

Apiers.  line from this float could pass over a pulley, the motion of which, trans-

mitted through a shaft, would give all the req[uired measurements. The measure-

ment of the aggregate heiglit of the waves would be eftected by simply connecting

Aa ratchet-wheel, pawled so as only to turn one way, with the float pulley.  pro-

jecting stud on the ratchet-wheel would record the aggregate height of the waves

by means of any mechanical counting arrangement. In order to count the waves,

it was simply necessaiy to record the number of times the float pulley reversed its

motion. This was effected by a reciprocating frame connected with a ratchet-

wheel by a pawl, which the wheel could reverse by lifting the reciprocating frame.

The method of counting which he proposed was to malie a pencil which, if imdis-

turbed, traced a straight line on a long slip of paper, such as a Morse telegraph-coil,

and received a slight shake at stated numbers. Time would be marked on the

same paper by a clock giving a similar shake to another pencil at stated intervals of

time. In this manner a permanent and continuous record of the number of waves

and aggregate height at all times would be automatically made. The machine

might be perfectly boxed in, with no other communication with the external pulleys

and float than a shaft passing through a stuffing-box. The recording machinery

would thus be secm-e from injury. It would, moreover, require attention only once

a day. The writer also described an arrangement by which the same machine

might be made to trace the profile of waves whenever required ; but this addi-

tional apparatus would require to be specially set at work when made, the waves of

the sea being far too numerous for it to be possible to take portraits of all of them.

Mr. Merrifield suggested that it would be very interesting to establish such an

apparatus at Brighton Pier.

   On the relative Value of Clarified and Unelarified Seioage as a Manure.

                             By William Paul, F.B.A.S.

   The author of this paper, after briefly pointing out the sources whence plants
derive their food and the conditions most favom-able to the free use of this food,
stated that all his experience, which was considerable, was in favour of the use of
" clarified" sewage, to which he attached great value.

   " Now, highly important as is the use of appropriate manures to aid in the
development of our growing crops, as a cultivator, I attach more importance than

--is commonly attached to the physical conditions of the soil especially to keepino-

the surface loose and the soil porous that the water may get away, and that the
air- and sun-heat may follow wherever the water or clarified sewage goes. The

clarified sewage is food placed within reach of the roots; the presence of air
renders this food more plentiful, and the sun-heat stimulates the roots to feed.
The fertility of a soil is therefore largely influenced by the amount of air-heat
which it contains.

   " This brings me to the principal objection which I have to m-ge against putting
sewage on the land in an ' unelarified or sludgy state. I am free to admit that

the sewage clarifies in its passage downwards, presenting to the roots the same food
as if the sewage had been previously clarified. But thB sm-face of the earth is
thereby made to act as a filter, and the physical conditions of the soil are altered.
The 'unelarified' sewage in passing through the soil has become clarified; but the
pores of the soil are more or less closed against the passage of air, and a solid or
half-liquid glutinous mass rests on the surface of the earth, throwing back the sun-
heat ! The food is there, but the stimulants of air- and sun-heat are shut out or
greatly diminished, and the fertility of the soil is impaired in a corresponding

degree."

 On some Recent Improvements in tJie Manufacture of Artificial Stone, and the

    Application of such Stone to Constructive and other Purposes. By Feedeeick

     Eansome, A.I.O.E,

    The progressive development of the natural world, through periods which
 occurred long before the dawn of the most remote traditions of antiquity, has
placed at the disposal of man materials which for the most part eminently
 subserve the varied purposes of construction and decoration. These materials,
 however, such as the granites, marbles, sandstones, limestones, &c., occur in
isolated groups, in some instances so remote from the centres of civilization as to
render the employment of them prohibitable for general use, excepting in local
situations. The requirements of man at an early period of his history demanded
a material which should approximately fulfil the conditions of stone ; and this
necessity was in the earlier ages supplied by the manufacture of bricks, concrete,
&c. The advantages attbrded by these substances were readily recognized by the
ancients, and have been fully appreciated in modern times ; but great as these

advantages are in a constructive point of view, they fall very far short of the

requirements of the present age.

    It is therefore no matter for surprise that numerous attempts have been made,
from time to time, to supersede the productions of nature by the imitations of art
and the importance of producing a material combining all the advanlages, without
having the defects, of the most useful building-stones, and jiossibly possessing

attributes peculiarly and specifically its own, was recofjiiized many years since by
the author, who set himself the task of solving the problem of manufacturing an
artificial stone which should economically answer the varied purposes of the pro-

ductions of nature.

   His investigations into the nature and properties of stone commenced nearly
thirty years since, and he found that, with few exceptions, the hardest and most
durable stones were those which contained the largest proportion of silica.

   Many geologists will doubtless recollect that some years since a siliceous
mineral was discovered at the base of the chalk hills in Surrey (especially in the
neighbourhood of Farnham) possessing some very peculiar properties, amongst

others that of being readily soluble in a solution of caustic soda, at a moderately

low temperature. Taking advantage of this peculiarity, the author commenced a
series of experiments, in order to determine if it were not possible, without the use

of chloride of calcium, to produce a stone in all respects equal in quality to what
had hitherto been done ; and in this he has now succeeded.

   By this latter process he combines a portion of the Farnham stone, or soluble

silica, with a solution of silicate of soda or potash, lime (or substances containing

lime), sand, alumina, chalk, or other convenient and suitable materials, which,

when intimately mixed, are moulded into the required form as heretofore, and
allowed to harden gradually, as silicate of lime is formed by the combination of
the ingredients present. The mass then becomes thoroughly indurated and con-

verted into a compact stone, capable of sustaining extraordinary pressure, and in-
creasing in hardness with age.

  The chemical actions which effect these results appear to be as under. When

the materials are mixed together, the silicate of soda is decomposed, the silicic
acid being liberated combines with the lime and forms a compound silicate of lime
and alumina, while a portion of soda in a caustic condition is set free. This
caustic soda immediately seizes upon the soluble silica (from Farnham), which
constitutes one of the ingredients, and thus forms a fresh supply of silicate of
soda, which is in its turn decomposed by a further quantity of lime, and so on.

   If each decomposition of silicate of soda resulted in the setting free of the whole
of the caustic soda, these decomposing processes would go on as long as there was
any soluble silica present with which the caustic soda could combine, or until
          TEANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                               249

there ceased to be any imcombined lime to decompose the silicate of soda produced,
the termination of the action being marked by the presence in the pores of the

stone of the excess of caustic soda in the one case, or of silicate of soda in the
otliei'. In reality, however, the whole of the caustic soda does not appear to be

set free each time the silicate of soda is decomposed by the lime, there appearing
to he formed a compound silicate of lime and soda, whereby a small portion of the
latter is fixed at each decomposition. The result is that the caustic soda is gradually
fixed, and none remains to be removed by washing or the other process.

   At the age of 10 weeks, in stones made by this process, the strength as compared
with Portland stone was found to be as 714y lbs. to 2630 lbs. per square inch, and
as compared with Bramley Fall 714;0 lbs. to 5120 lbs., and as regards granite
714o lbs. to 1200 lbs. per square inch. With reference to durability, it has been

fouud practically to withstand the atmospheric changes of various climates, havino-
been exposed to the cold of Russia and the heat and rains of India. In general
appearance it beai-s such a perfect resemblance to the best description of natural
stones as to mislead the most critical observers, whilst the facility of application
and its economy in use will have been apparent from the foregoing description.

   By means of this process the field has been widely extended for the application

of the stone produced thereby, and which for convenience, as distinguishing it from

all others, has been termed Apcenite. It is now no difficult task to produce blocks

of this material of any form and of any size, the only limit being the means
available for handling them upou the spot where they are to be employed. More-
over, the materials which form the bulk of apo3nite are, as a rule, generally to be
fouud in abundance where hydraulic or other important works are being carried on,
and for which purposes the new stone is eminently suited.

   The want of such a material for such a purpose has long been felt, although that

want, until recently, has only been partially supplied. In 1870 Mr. J. W. Butler

applied for and obtained a patent for improvements in the application of Concrete

to Structures and Foundation, also to Ooft'erdams and similar constructions. Mr.

Butler's obvious desire was, in the first place, to provide a cheap and efficient sub-
stitute for stone for hydraulic operations, and in the second to render unnecessary

the construction of false works, Sec, and thus to avoid the expense connected with

the employment of iron cylinders, hitherto so extensively used. The idea was

certainly an excellent one, but in realization appeared to Mr. Butler very remote,

until it occurred to him that the material then introduced under the name of
" apcenite " would answer the purposes of his proposed methods of construction.

lie accordingly communicated with the author upon the subject ; and with the
sanction of the engineer, a set of hollow cj'liuders 8 ft. in diameter and 9 in. thick
were made to form a part of a retaining wall to protect the foreshore of the Thames

at Hermitage Wharf, where they were accordingly sunk, and tlie result was satis-

factory.

   The application of this principle is capable of modification to suit almost every
variety of construction, and it will be found especially applicable in structures
requiring heavy foundations, particularly where the ground is uncertain.

   For forming a face-wall in building quays or docks, instead of cylinders,

rectangular hollow blocks or caissons may be used. By emploj'ing hollow blocks

of hexagonal form no interstices are left, a thin layer of the cementing material

rendering the structure practically homogeneous. Cj'linders constructed upon tliis

principle are also adapted for deep wells, apertures being formed in the sides for

the admission of wfiter.

   Turning to works of greater magnitude, it will be seen that apcenite forms a
suitable substance for the construction of bridges, sea-walls, piers, and similar
undertakings. Such structures could be carried iip to the underside of the bridge-
girders, or built with ordinary masonry above high-water level. For sea-walls or
piers another arrangement could he adopted, two rows of caissons being emplo^'ed,

separated from each other longitudinally, the intermediate space being filled in with
dry rubble hearting, and the bloclcs themselves with a similar material or, if
necessary, with concrete.

It would not be difficult to multiply the instances in which this material can be

Anpractically applied ; but suffi.cient has been said on this point.  artificial stone

combining the advantages of apcenite, one, moreover, wliiclx can be so readily
moulded into any form and size with but small expense and little or no delay, is

necessarily applicable to a great variety of uses. The author then made a few
brief remarks upon its applicability for ornamental and decorative purposes.

   Besides possessing the several properties which have been described, the apcenite,
when prepared with suitable materials, is capable of receiving the most delicate
impressions, and by the incorporation of various metallic oxides, any variety of
colour can be imparted to it.

   By the use of the native red oxide of iron, manganese, and other mineral

substances, artificial marble or granite of almost every description can be produced.
These artificial stones, like their originals, are capable of taking an excellent polish,
are extremely hard, and can be readily moulded into the most elaborate forms, at a
very suiall cost.

   In conclusion, the author submits that, both consti-uctively and ornamentally,
apcenite is eminently fitted to meet tlie numerous requirements of the engineer
and architect, and to subserve manj' useful and important purposes in the indus-

trial arts.

 On an Apparatus for testing the Water-stopping efficiency of Clay Soils and
   other Substances under various wressifres. By John Smytu, Jun., A.AI.,

    M.I.C.EJ.

    The author, when engaged in 18G7 in repairing a leak in the piincipal embank-
ment of the reservoir for supplying the river Bann in Irelnnd (see Transactions of
the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland, vol. ix. page 51, " An Historical
Sketch of the Construction, Working, and Repair of the Bann Eeservoir"), was
obliged to make experiments on the capabilities of peat, clays, and soils in stanching
 water, and felt the want of an efficient apparatus for the purpose. Subsequently,
 after making more experiments, he was led to devise the apparatus of which 'a
 diagram was exhibited. The instrument consists of a cylindrical chamber 6 inches
 in diameter, 3 feet deep, provided at the bottom with a perforated plate, which
 allows aU leakage to pass away, and at the top with another plate into which is
 screwed a 1 inch in diameter iron pipe, made of such length as the position of the
 instrument and the pressure to be experimented with will allow. Two narrow

 glass windows, 2 feet long by ^ inch wide, are provided on opposite sides of the
 cyUnder, by which to observe the behaviour of the substance under experiment
 First a layer of gravel is put in to cover the holes in the bottom plate, next the

 experimental substance is rammed in, and next another layer of gravel. The

 author has tried experiments on 1 foot deep of peat, and found that although at

 first the leakage is increased by increase of pressure, yet when the pressure is kept
constant it soon diminishes even with clear water; in new embankments the
 water passing through would be muddj-, and likely to diminish the leakage much
 sooner. The author intends to make more experiments, and in the mean time
commended the instrument to the notice of the Section as likely to be useful to

those engaged in the construction of waterworks.

On a Plan for Railway Amalqamation tvith Government Control,
                           iitj \YAxmm%F.C.S.

The author stated the objections botli to extensive amalganaations and to

Government purchase and management, and suggested that the evils of both could

be avoided, and the advantages lioped for from each secured, by blending the

two scliemes. Our railways should be arranged in six or more groups, and the

numerous classes of shares, stock, &c. in each group be reduced by a commission

of actuaries, partlj^ to debentures bearing a fixed interest, but the larger portion to

ordinary stock on which the Government should guarantee a minimum dividend.

The majority of the Directors to be still elected by the Shareholders, but a few

nominated by the Board of Trade, and perhaps some by the large towns and

counties interested. The Directors would have a substantial motive for efficient

and economical management in keeping the dividend above the guaranteed

minimum ; but the Board of Trade would fix the tariff' both for passengers and goods,

Aand should try the experiment of greatly reduced fares.  central Council elected

by the various Boards of Directors, with some members selected by the Board of

Trade, could supervise the whole. Such a scheme would secure the following

advantages :^lst, the public would gain safer, cheaper, and better-arranged con-

veyances ; 2nd, the management of the property would still be with the Directors,

the majority of whom would be elected by the Shareholders ; 3rd, a vast saving

would result from more economical and harmonious working ; 4th, the property

of the Shareholder woidd always maintain a certain value ; and 5th, the public,

through the Government, without purchasing the railways, would have a real and

efficient control over the whole system, but this could not degenerate into a

system of patronage and jobbing. Necessary arrangements for new lines and

extensions are alluded to, and the author suggests that an introduction of American

carriages would be cheaper and safer and dispense with the necessity of signals.

                    On the use of Steel Wire for Deep-sea Soundings.

                    By Prof. Sir W. Thomson, LL.D., F.E.S.

   The wire used is pianoforte wire of 22 gauge, which is less cumbersome and

heavy and acts with less friction than the hempen line now used. It needs not the

heavy mass of iron, weighing from two to four hundredweight, hitherto employed
to sink it, 30 lbs. being amply sufficient for sounding in 3000 fathoms. It is paid
out rapidly from a small drum controlled by a simple break composed of a cord
fixed at one end, and with a weight of from 10 lbs. to GO lbs. at the other, passing
once and a half round the drum. It is easily and quickly drawn up, contrasting
most advantageously in rapidity and power required with the old system. The steel
is preserved from rusting by the use of powdered lime, or by keeping the drum in
oil when not in use.

                     By Prof. Sir "W. Thomsok, LL.B., F.E.S.

   The author drew the attention of the Section to the extreme importance of
ready identification of lights at sea ; and he pointed out how difficult it is, under

the present system of lighthouses, to distinguish one lighthouse from another.

The means now adopted of slow revolving lights, with ditlerent periods, were

wholly inadequate, and were constantly leading to eiTor and sometimes to disaster.

He proposed the use of flashing lights, the flash being of longer or shorterduration,

the short and long flashes representing the dot and dash of the Morse alphabet

now used for telegraphing. Each lighthouse should signal its own letter, and
would thus be readily and rapidly distinguished. Such a system was now used
regularly in the navy for the transmission of messages at sea ; and as what he

proposed involved only the signalling of a single letter, he considered there need
be no difficulty in its adoption, and he thought that the subject should be pressed
strongly on the Government.

HUME'S HISTOEY OF ENGLAND TO THE

             EEVOLUTION OF 1688.

A NEW LIBKAEY EDITION. Annotated and Revised.

During the hundred and ten j-ears which have passed since the completion of Hume's

great woik, no successful attemjit has heen made to supersede it as the standard HistoiT-
"We --of England.
      all fall Lack upon Hume"'-- says Dean Hook "notwithstanding

his many shortcomings and lamentahle faults." To supply those shortcomings and

nmend those faults, and so to hring Hume's work uji to the existing state of historical

science, is the object of the present undertaking.

     The whole work, whether cf revision or re-writing, will be based on the original
authorities. The publication of our ancient Chronicles and our National Eecords, now in
progress under the care of the Master of the Eolls, through the hands of very able
Editors, offers new facilities for such an undertaking.

    It is proposed to complete the History, as far as it was can-ied by Hume, distri-

buted as follows :

  I.-- Ekom the Earliest Times to the End of the Plantagenet Link

                3 VoL«.

 II.--The Tudor Age. 2 Vols.
